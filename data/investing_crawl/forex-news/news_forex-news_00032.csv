 * U.S. dollar vulnerable near 15-year low on yen
 * Gold, government bonds ease
 By Koh Gui Qing
 SYDNEY, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Asian stocks touched one-month
highs on Monday and European bourses extended last week's
rally, as investors bet a recent run of better-than-expected
economic data meant the world was not going to slide back into
recession.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 of top European shares rose 0.4
percent in early trade, as did Germany's DAX, while Britain's
FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 both gained 0.5 percent.
 The improved market mood came after Friday's U.S. jobs data
was not as bad as some had feared, allaying worries about a
second recession in the world's biggest economy.
 Some said a 1.3 percent jump in the S&P 500 on Friday also
helped to brighten the mood. U.S. markets were closed for a
holiday on Monday.
 ""There was nothing to scare the equity market into its
usual September submission, and the performance of the S&P at
the end of last week was encouraging,"" said Sean Keane, an
analyst at Triple T Consulting in New Zealand.
 As always, hopes for steady growth aided growth-sensitive
stocks and commodities, at the expense of safe-havens such as
gold and government bonds.
 The MSCI Asia stock index outside Japan jumped 1.2 percent.
In a nod to hopes for firm growth prospects, the sub-index for
non-essential consumer goods fared the best with a 1.4 percent
climb.
 Japan was Asia's best performer, with the Nikkei climbing
2.1 percent and the broader Topix rising 1.8 percent. Traders
said buying had gained momentum after the Nikkei broke above
its 25-day moving average.
 Growth-sensitive exporters led the rise. Kyocera Corp
climbed 2 percent; TDK Corp added 2.4 percent, and Tokyo
Electron Ltd rose 1.9 percent.
 Copper, a popular gauge for the state of industrial
activity, was firm with London prices near four-month peaks.
 The preference for risk -- for now -- took the shine off
the U.S. dollar's safe-haven appeal. It flitted near a 15-year
low on the yen, held back by in the interim by investor
wariness of possible intervention from Tokyo.
 Equally, Japanese government bond yields also hit an
eight-week low, while most U.S. Treasury two- to 10-year note
futures edged lower.
 Gold, another traditional haven, was steady, while oil,
which tends to benefit when the growth outlook improves, was an
anomaly.
 It fell towards $74 a barrel as peak gasoline use in the
United States, a top consumer, waned with the end of the summer
driving season.
 STILL CAUTIOUS ON EQUITIES
 But some analysts warned the market was not ready to dive
into risky assets just yet.
 The latest data from EPFR Global showed investors still had
U.S. growth doubts firmly on their mind as they continued to
pull money from stocks in favour of bonds.
 Equity portfolios across regions suffered, but those in the
United States were the worse hit.
 Even in Asia, price performance showed the region's stock
market has had a rough ride.
 The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is flat for the year, with
just a 0.8 percent gain. The Shanghai Composite index, which
resides in the world's growth engine, has struggled with a near
18 percent drop since January.
 In contrast, two-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a record low
last month, while Indonesian bonds have awarded investors
handsome dollar-adjusted returns of over 20 percent for the
year.

China is likely to pass $100 billion this year for the first
time, official media said on Monday.
 Non-financial FDI hit a record $92.4 billion in 2008 but
fell to $90 billion in 2009 after the global financial crisis.
 Foreign investors are upbeat about China's economic outlook
and Beijing's efforts to improve the investment environment have

Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the commerce ministry, as saying.
 China drew $58.4 billion in FDI in the first seven months of
the year, up 20.7 percent from the same period of 2009.
 Another official, Liu Zuozhuang, said China's outbound
investments this year were likely to reach $60 billion.
 The officials were speaking at a news briefing on Sunday.
 In 2009, Chinese companies' outbound direct investment was
worth $56.5 billion, an increase of 1.1 percent from 2008.
 ""China is now the fifth largest investing nation worldwide,
and the largest among developing nations,"" said Shen, according
to the China Daily.
 He said the flow would rise further in coming years.
 Despite intense interest in China's ties with Africa and
other distant developing markets, 71.4 percent of Chinese
outbound investment was within Asia in 2009.
 Africa accounted for 2.6 percent and Latin America 13.0
percent, said the Ministry of Commerce, according to the China

2,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2010 08:32PM ET</span>",FOREX-Dollar on defensive after U.S. payrolls," *Risk currencies recovering after positive U.S. payrolls
 *Dollar looks vulnerable against yen near 15-yr low
 *Kiwi down slightly after earthquake
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive on
Monday after firm U.S. payrolls data last week eased market
anxiety over chances of a double-dip recession and boosted demand
for the euro and growth-leveraged currencies.
 The dollar looked vulnerable against the yen after failing to
maintain its gains following Friday's payrolls data, though
caution about Japanese intervention deterred further yen buying.
 ""Looking at price actions after Friday's payrolls data,
people seemed to have been well-prepared for a rebound in the
dollar/yen. Thus the dollar will be capped for now,"" said a
trader at a Japanese bank.
 ""But on the other hand, we don't have strong reasons to buy
the yen either. I expect the dollar/yen to be stuck in a narrow
range,"" the trader said.
 The euro changed hands at $1.2885, having risen to $1.2898
after the payrolls data on Friday, its highest in two weeks. It
faces resistance around $1.2920-35.
 U.S. non-farm payrolls fell 54,000, the Labor Department
said, a much smaller drop than the predicted 100,000. Private
employment, considered a better gauge of labour market health,
increased 67,000.
 The Australian dollar fetched $0.9155, down from late U.S.
levels last week but still near a four-week high around $0.9176
hit after the U.S. payrolls figures.
 The yen stood at 84.45 yen per dollar, not far from a 15-year
peak of 83.58 hit late last month.
 The yen has been bought in the past few months as investors
tend to favour currencies of countries with a current account
surplus when they want to avoid risky assets.
 Positive balance of payments figures also mean dollar selling
by Japanese exporters constantly outweighs dollar buying by
Japanese importers, capping the dollar versus the yen.
 The dollar/yen has had a very high correlation with U.S.
yield levels in recent months. The lower U.S. yields are, the
cheaper the dollar is against the yen, as lower yields tend to
discourage investment in the dollar.
 On Friday, however, the dollar did not make much headway
against the yen even as the payrolls data pushed U.S. yields
sharply higher.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Friday that currency speculators trimmed their long
positions on the yen last week but they still have big yen long
positions.
 Their long positions were cut to 49,904 from 51,069 contracts
the week before.
 Still, some analysts say the dollar could eventually gain.
 ""The U.S. dollar appears to be rebounding, which could make
for a rise in the dollar/yen to 85-86 yen,"" said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays.
 The New Zealand dollar dipped slightly at $0.7190, off
Friday's four-week peak of $0.7218 after a magnitude 7.1
earthquake struck the country's second-largest city,
Christchurch, causing widespread damage to infrastructure.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2010 03:04PM ET</span>",GLOBAL ECONOMY WEEKAHEAD-What might make the U.S. Fed flinch?," By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy appears to
be trudging along, neither booming nor busting, growing
steadily enough to diminish double-dip recession fears but not
quickly enough to bring down unemployment.
 That puts the U.S. Federal Reserve in a bit of a policy
pickle. If the economy were clearly backsliding, Fed Chairman
Ben Bernanke has made it clear he would not hesitate to
provide further support. But what about an economy that is
moving forward, albeit painfully slowly?
 Minutes of the central bank's August 10 policy meeting said
several officials felt the outlook would have to deteriorate
""appreciably"" to trigger more action, which might include
additional purchases of government debt or a promise to keep
interest rates near zero for an even longer stretch.
 The latest batch of data -- particularly the employment
report on Friday that showed stronger-than-expected private
hiring in August -- doesn't seem to fit that description.
 ""Is there enough here to prompt the Fed to pull the trigger
as early as at the Sept. 21 meeting? Probably not,"" said Lena
Komileva, an economist with Tullett Prebon in London.
 So what might make the Fed flinch?
 Neil Dutta, an economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
in New York, thinks the slow-but-steady economic slog will
eventually prod the Fed into action, perhaps early next year.
 His firm predicts a ""growth recession,"" which may sound
like an oxymoron but essentially sums up what is happening now.
The economy keeps growing, yet unemployment rises.
 Dutta said if monthly employment figures continue to show
only modest hiring and rising unemployment, ""the Fed is not
going to sit idle.""
 Indeed, many economists think the Fed will feel compelled
to step in if unemployment surpasses the recession high of 10.1
percent notched in October 2009. The rate rose to 9.6 percent
in August, and is likely to inch higher in the coming months.

 For a graphic, see: http://link.reuters.com/tec49n

 The White House is searching for new ideas that might help
reduce the stubbornly high unemployment rate, and President
Barack Obama said he would outline plans to boost the economy
this week. Tax cuts to encourage hiring are expected to be
among the proposals, but they would require support from
Republicans in Congress.
 Dutta pointed out that there are ""good"" and ""bad"" reasons
for unemployment to rise. The ""good"" kind, like now, is caused
by more people feeling confident enough about job prospects to
venture back into the labor force. The ""bad"" kind is driven by
increased job cuts. The first type might not spur the Fed into
action; the ""bad"" kind almost certainly would.
 On Wednesday, the Fed will release its ""Beige Book"" report
of anecdotal economic evidence gathered from its 12 regional
banks, which will provide insight into what is and isn't
working well.
 The report drills down to details as specific as Broadway
show ticket sales, rural crop conditions and vacation resort
bookings, and Fed officials routinely cite the findings when
they discuss their views on the economy.
 The last report, released in late July, added to double-dip
fears because some Fed districts reported the economy was
slowing. An upbeat report would support the idea the economy
regained some momentum after a sluggish second quarter and
encourage a wait-and-see approach from the Fed.
 TRADING PLACES
 Trade was by far the biggest drag on second-quarter U.S.
growth, which registered a lackluster 1.6 percent annual pace.
A surge in imports subtracted nearly 4.5 percentage points from
gross domestic product. Because GDP measures domestic growth,
imports count as a negative.
 Thursday's July trade report is expected to show the gap
narrowed slightly, which would ease pressure on third-quarter
economic growth.
 Michael Gapen, an economist with Barclays Capital in New
York, said the third quarter appeared to be off to a
""respectable start"" and growth will likely be modestly stronger
than in the second quarter.
 The Fed's Bernanke would seem to agree. He pointed out in
late August that the spike in imports was probably due to
fleeting factors, and economic growth should pick up.
 If growth doesn't accelerate, however, that would be one
more plausible trigger for renewed Fed action.
 China may offer a big clue about whether U.S. imports
really are subsiding. It is scheduled to release trade figures
for August on Friday, and those are likely to show another
month of explosive gains in exports. Economists polled by
Reuters think China's exports rose 35 percent, while imports
increased a relatively modest 26.1 percent.

 * Labour action entering fourth week
 
 By Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Unions representing South
African state workers are expected to announce on Sunday whether
they will accept a government wage offer they previously
rejected and end a strike by 1.3 million employees. 
 Unions have so far turned down the revised 7.5 percent wage
increase, which is double inflation, and 800 rand a month for a
housing allowance. 
 ""We will make an announcement this afternoon,"" Sidumo
Dlamini, president of South Africa's largest labour federation
told Reuters.
 Unions representing workers including nurses, teachers,
prison guards, court clerks and immigration officials have asked
for pay rises of 8.6 percent and 1,000 rand a month for housing.
 Union sources said even if a decision to accept the revised
offer is announced on Sunday, workers might not return to their
posts on Monday.
 ""It's more likely that it will be business as usual later in
the week,"" said a union official who did not want to be named.
 Government officials have said the state has no room in the
budget to increase what it has already offered, which would
swell state spending by about one percent.
 Pay and benefits are the biggest expenditure category in the
state budget. In 2006/07, about 35 percent of tax revenue went
towards it. That rose to about 47 percent in 2009/10.

 * Specific currencies not discussed at all - official
(Updates with currencies)
 By Yoo Choonsik and Rachel Armstrong
 GWANGJU, South Korea, Sept 5 (Reuters) - The world economy
is recovering moderately but still faces challenges such as the
need for medium-term fiscal consolidation, the IMF's First
Managing Director, John Lipsky, said on Sunday.
 ""They are mainly confident that there is a moderate
recovery underway globally,"" he told reporters, referring to
delegates at the G20 meeting of deputy finance and central bank
chiefs in South Korea.
 ""Obviously there are risks and challenges, but things seem
to be moving more or less in line with our forecast,"" he said,
listing well-designed exit strategies and medium-term fiscal
consolidation as challenges.
 He said some good progress has been made in discusing
changes to the IMFs executive board, but did not elaborate. G20
members have pledged to reach an agreement on the issue by the
time leaders meet in Seoul in November.
 The United States, frustrated at Europe's refusal to share
more IMF power with emerging economies, took unprecedented
action last month to block plans that would have kept Europe's
long-running dominance over the 24-member board.
 Emerging economies have called for a bigger say in
international institutions such as the IMF in line with their
increasing contribution to the global economy and the resultant
importance in global economic policy coordination.
 A senior Indonesian official told Reuters separately that
emerging economies want more voting powers as well as a
readjustment in the way the global economic policy is made.
 ""For emerging markets, the important thing is not only the
size of the increase of the quota, but the general idea of the
relationship between the quota and governance of the IMF -- and
that needs to come in one package,"" Hartadi Sarwono, deputy
governor of the Indonesian central bank, said in an interview.
 One senior official from a member country, who attended the
whole of the meetings, told Reuters there was no discussion
about specific currencies or currency issues, although issues
related to reducing the global imbalances were a key topic.
 ""Delegates did not talk about any specific currencies or
about a specific level of a currency, but of course they
discussed global rebalancing,"" said the official, who did not
want to be identified.
 Japan is grappling with the yen's soaring to 15-year highs
against the dollar and policymakers have repeatedly said they
could take decisive action on the yen -- normally a code phrase
for currency intervention.
 South Korea will host the Nov. 11-12 summit of G20 leaders
in Seoul, with key issues also including reforming the global
financial regulatory framework and drawing up plans to put the
world economy on a balanced and sustainable growth path.

 The appointment, which is expected to be approved by the
Rosneft board, would end long-running speculation about the top

 TOKYO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda said on Saturday Tokyo would take decisive steps
to stem the yen's rise when needed, while suggesting that
coordinated currency market intervention was a difficult
option.
 Traders are getting cautious about bidding the yen up too
much after Japanese ministers kept up warnings against the
currency's surge to 15-year high versus the dollar.
Policymakers have repeatedly said they could take decisive
action on the yen -- normally a code phrase for currency
intervention.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan and ruling party powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa are facing off in a ruling party leadership vote
on Sept. 14 that is distracting policymakers as Japan confronts
a strong yen and weak economy. The winner will likely be prime
minister by virtue of the party's majority in the powerful
lower house.
 Kan and Noda have said Japan would take decisive action on
currencies without using the word intervention. But Ozawa has
more specifically threatened to intervene in the currency
market.
 ""What they (Kan and Ozawa) have been saying means the same
thing. The issue is whether we would actually decide to
intervene at the end,"" Noda said on a Tokyo television
programme.
 ""Our statement that we would take decisive steps when
needed says it all,"" he added.
 Despite repeated warnings, traders have doubts over whether
Tokyo will step into the forex market now because it could have
trouble convincing leaders of other major economies about the
need to intervene at a time when they are calling on China to
make the yuan more flexible to ease global imbalances.
 They say the United States and European countries seem to
have no interest in helping Japan by jointly intervening in the
market to curb the yen's rise as they want to benefit from
falls in their currencies, which boost exports.
 Asked about the perception that coordination with other
countries on the yen's rise seem to be tough, Noda said, ""It's
about what we can do while coordination is difficult.""

 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Stocks jumped and commodities
rose on Friday after data showing fewer U.S. job losses than
expected reinforced other reports this week to ease fears the
American economy is on the cusp of a new recession.
 The U.S. dollar fell against most foreign currencies and
government debt prices slid as risk aversion ebbed on optimism
the U.S. economy may not be as anemic as many had feared. For
details see: [ID:nN03124790]
 The Labor Department said non-farm payrolls fell 54,000 in
August. Private employment, considered a better gauge of labor
market health than government hiring, added 67,000 jobs after
an upwardly revised 107,000 gain in July.
 Recent poor economic data had strongly suggested for many
in the market that a double-dip recession might be ahead.
 ""It's not a great report, but it's a bit better than
expected, and it does not indicate that we're into some sort of
headlong plunge into a double dip,"" said Nigel Gault, chief
U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts.
 Risky assets later pared gains after a report showed the
U.S. non-manufacturing sector grew below expectations in
August, but services still expanded for an eighth straight
month.
 Copper prices hit a four-month high and silver climbed to
its highest since March 2008 on the improved outlook for
economic growth.

 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index closed at a

 While investors' appetite for risk rose on the payrolls

 ""What we're seeing here is that the recovery continues to
bounce around. This supports our view that we're going to see a

 By Aleksandra Michalska
 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
most foreign currencies on Friday after a surprisingly strong
non-farm payroll report eased worries about the economy and
boosted the appetite for riskier assets.
 The safe-haven yen and Swiss franc weakened broadly, while
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar gained
as expectations grew that the health of the U.S. labor market
may not be as poor as many had feared.
 U.S. non-farm payrolls fell by 54,000 in August, the Labor
Department said, well below expectations for a decline of
100,000. And private employment, considered a better gauge of
labor market health, increased more than had been forecast.
 ""Today's employment number was encouraging,"" said Kevin
Chau, FX strategist at IDEAglobal in New York. ""But I think the
market is still looking for more signs that we are not heading
towards double dip.""
 Optimism about the economy, however, faded slightly after
separate data showed the U.S. non-manufacturing sector grew
more slowly than expected in August and the sector's employment
shrank.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks the
greenback versus a basket of six currencies, last fell 0.5
percent to 82.052.
 Stephen Butler, director of forex trading at Scotia Capital
in Toronto, expects further dollar weakness in the near term as
risk appetite stays supported.
 The euro traded at $1.2884, up 0.5 percent. Against the
yen, it gained 0.6 percent to 108.69 yen.
 While the jobs report may mitigate fears of a double-dip
recession, some analysts cautioned that the U.S. economy is
still in for a slow recovery.
 ""Just as trading on the bad U.S. data recently was
overdone, I think sentiment on this week's positive reports is
also going to be overdone,"" said Fabian Eliasson, vice
president of currency sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New
York. ""You have a lot of people unemployed, so it's a long way

 The dollar earlier rallied more than 1 percent against the
yen to a session high of 85.22 yen after the jobs data,
according to Reuters data. It pared most gains after the
weaker-than-expected services data from the Institute for
Supply Management, and last traded up 0.2 percent at 84.42
yen.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen on electronic
trading platform EBS late last month on fears the U.S. economic
recovery was stalling.
 IDEAglobal's Chau said the dollar/yen may still try to dip
below 80 and traders will likely continue to pay close
attention to the risk of currency intervention by Japanese
authorities to weaken the yen.

1.3114 francs, off from an all-time low around 1.2850 earlier

"
19,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2010 02:40PM ET</span>",Q+A-What options does Obama have to boost US hiring?," By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
is considering a number of options to try to jump-start job
creation, the top priority for recession-weary Americans as the
country heads toward congressional elections in November.
 Obama unveiled one new initiative on Monday -- a six-year
plan to overhaul the United States' aging highways, railways
and airport runways with an initial investment of $50 billion
in the first year.
 He is expected to announce more initiatives on Wednesday,
including extending a tax credit for companies for research and
development. But is it all too little too late?
 The Obama administration's caution reflects the hard
political truth that there are not enough votes in the U.S.
Congress to deliver another government spending bill to rival
the $814 billion stimulus package he signed in 2009.
 The White House is adamant it will not propose a second
giant effort. In an election campaign in which opposition
Republicans are playing on voters' anxiety about record U.S.
spending, ""stimulus"" has become a dirty word.
 Republicans have castigated Obama for what they call
reckless spending, sapping support for more action among
Democrats in tight election races in November.
 But deepening voter discontent over the stubbornly high 9.6
percent unemployment rate, means Obama has to do something to
stimulate job growth, even though analysts agree he has few
options and that there is little he can do before November's
elections.
 Here are some questions and answers about what is already
on the table and what Obama is reported to be considering.
 WHAT IS OBAMA PROPOSING?
 -- Obama will ask Congress on Wednesday to increase and
permanently extend a tax credit for business research as a way
of boosting job growth, administration officials say. The
proposal would cost $100 billion over 10 years.
 A one-year extension had already been written into
legislation before Congress, and investors had assumed it would
be made permanent.
 -- Obama announced on Monday a plan to rebuild 150,000
miles (240,000 km) of roads; construct and maintain 4,000 miles
(6,400 km) of rail; and rehabilitate or reconstruct 150 miles
(240 km) of runway and modernize the air traffic control
system.
 The plan, dismissed by Republicans as a ""last-minute,
cobbled-together stimulus bill,"" could be funded in part by
rolling back tax breaks for oil and gas companies, the
administration says. It will not have an immediate stimulative
effect on hiring as it is not expected to generate new jobs
until 2011. The Obama administration has no firm figure for the
number of new jobs but says it will be ""substantial.""
 WHAT ELSE IS HE CONSIDERING?
 Obama will talk about several initiatives to stimulate the
economy in a speech on Wednesday, but it is not clear whether
he will offer new ideas or simply repeat Monday's announcement
while formally unveiling the business research tax proposal.
 Here are some other ideas he is considering.
 -- Tax cuts to encourage hiring in the United States. This
could include relief for employers to encourage hiring. It's
the kind of measure that might get Republican support in
Congress, but not before the elections.
 The White House is reported to be considering using revenue
from expiring tax cuts for the wealthy to finance about $35
billion of tax cuts for small businesses and workers.
 -- Extending former President George W. Bush's tax cuts for
families earning less than $250,000 a year. Experts from the
congressional Joint Committee on Taxation say this would cost
$1.3 trillion over a decade, and add a further $700 billion if
the tax cuts for richer Americans are also extended, as
Republicans want.
 WHAT IS ALREADY OUT THERE?
 -- Getting Congress to agree to renewing Obama's Making
Work Pay tax credit of $800 for a married couple or $400 for
individuals. Available for taxpayers who make less than $75,000
a year, it will expire at the end of 2010 unless Congress votes
to extend it.
 -- Getting Congress to agree to extend long-term
unemployment insurance again. This expires at the end of
November unless Congress backs another extension.
 -- More bonus depreciation to encourage businesses to
investment in capital equipment, which the revenue service
allows them to write off at a faster pace, helping small
business cash flow without producing a hefty price-tag for the
deficit because the costs are pushed out into the future.
 HOW MUCH HELP IS NEEDED?
 -- Top Obama adviser Christina Romer, in her final speech
as chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers,
on Wednesday urged policymakers to find the will to act to
spare the country the damage of high unemployment.
 Growth slowed in the second quarter to 1.6 percent and
other recent data has been mixed, keeping concerns alive that
the economy could be heading toward a double-dip recession.

"
20,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2010 02:36PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-US tax and spending policies floating in Washington," WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on
Friday said he will offer a batch of new ideas to jump-start
the moribund economic recovery, as the jobless rate ticked
higher to 9.6 percent in August.
 Congress has balked at even modest new spending initiatives
in recent months and officials say the proposals are likely to
be narrowly targeted. Following is a summary of some tax and
spending policies that have been floated by administration and
congressional leaders.
 TAX POLICY:
 INDIVIDUAL TAXES
 Tax cuts for all individuals expire at year-end unless
Congress takes action to extend them. Obama has stood firm on
his pledge to extend the lower tax rates for what he calls the
middle class - individuals making less than $200,000 and
couples earning $250,000 and under.
 Obama and fellow Democrats say the wealthy are unlikely to
spend the extra funds while Republicans say such individuals
fuel consumption spending, investment and hiring.
 Some Democrats, however, are pushing for an extension of
all Bush-era tax cuts at least for another year while the
economy is still on the mend.
 PAYROLL TAX HOLIDAY
 A version of this break already exists in the Hiring
Incentives to Restore Employment Act signed into law in March
that gives tax credits to business to hire workers who have
been unemployed for eight weeks or longer.
 The Obama administration says businesses that qualified for
the credits have hired about 5.6 million workers, but the
administration has been unable to link hiring directly to the
incentive.
 A new version could give a break on payroll taxes, shared
by workers and employers, without the need to hire new workers
and extend the time period to use the credits.
 Lawmakers would have to work out the accounting so the
Social Security trust fund doesn't take the financial hit.
 BUSINESS TAX BREAKS
 The House of Representatives has already passed a $31
billion package that renews for a year corporate tax
incentives, including a research and development tax credit and
tax credits for biofuel use, that have expired.
 Obama has already called for permanent extension of the R&D
tax credit -- a popular idea among both political parties -- in
his budget.
 This so-called tax extenders bill also includes tax breaks
for improvements to retail business and for finance companies
earning money abroad.
 That Obama-backed measure, which is paid for by trimming
international tax perks enjoyed by some of the same companies,
has stalled in the Senate.
 INFRASTRUCTURE:
 BUILD AMERICA BONDS
 Taxable so-called Build America Bonds, created in the
stimulus program last year, were designed to finance
infrastructure projects. Moves to extend the program beyond
December have largely stalled in Congress.
 The bonds pay issuers a federal rebate of about 35 percent
of interest costs, and led to $122 billion in bond sales by
state and local governments since their debut in April of last
year.
 Obama has proposed making the program permanent and setting
the subsidy level at 28 percent, a level the Treasury
Department considers revenue neutral. A recent government
report said more than two-thirds of the $34 billion in payments
to BABS is offset by higher revenues.
 INFRASTRUCTURE BANK
 Obama has proposed a grant and lending institution that
would be an independent entity within the Transportation
Department and would first focus on highway, bridge and
waterway projects. The administration's five-year projection is
to capitalize the bank at $25 billion and Obama has sought up
to $7 billion in initial funding from Congress.
 SMALL BUSINESS HELP
 Obama again called for passage of a $20-30 billion bill to
invest in banks with assets of less than $10 billion to spur
investment in small business. Republicans have blocked the
plan, calling it a waste of taxpayer funds.

 *Says will buy more Azeri gas if offered
 *European Union is also vying for large Azeri gas contracts
 *No economic benefit to Gazprom from Azeri gas -analysts
 
 By Jessica Bachman and Denis Dyomkin
 (adds quotes, analysis, background)
 BAKU, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Russia, the world's largest energy
producer, said it would double imports of Azeri gas next year, a
move analysts say has no direct economic benefit but is seen by
Moscow as key to maintaining its grip on Europe's gas market.
 ""It is much more expensive for Russia to buy gas from
Azerbaijan than to produce it domestically, but the more it buys
from Azerbaijan, the less others can buy,"" said Pavel Sorokin,
oil and gas analyst at Alfa Bank. 
 On Friday in Baku, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom
signed a deal with Azerbaijan's state energy firm SOCAR to buy
2 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas in 2011 and even more from
2012. This year it is buying 1 bcm.
 Russia re-exports the gas it buys from Azerbaijan. With
flagging demand in Europe, Gazprom's biggest export market,
analysts say more Azeri gas means domestic production will fall
proportionately and Gazprom will lose out on profits.
 ""Export volumes to Europe are going to stay flat so adding
more Azeri gas means Gazprom is reducing the share of Russian
gas in its export portfolio,"" said Mikhail Korchemkin, head of
East European Gas Analysis.
 Korchemkin said exporting 2 bcm of Russian gas gives Gazprom
around $200 million in profit and brings the state $160 million
in customs duties as European consumers pay, on average, 70
percent more for Russian gas than domestic customers do.
 ""Russia is purposefully missing out on $360 million a year
by paying market prices for Azeri gas. The idea is to prevent
Europe from buying the gas so it cannot diversity its supplies
away from Russia,"" said Korchemkin.

 STAVING OFF EUROPE
 The European Union has plans to build a $10 billion gas
pipeline, Nabucco, to transport up to 31 bcm of gas a year from
the Caspian region to an Austrian gas hub via Bulgaria, Romania,
Turkey and Hungary and reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas.
 But Nabucco shareholders have had a hard time clinching
supply contracts as a fourth round of United Nations sanctions
have axed the possibility of importing Iranian gas..
 Russia's moves to lock in more Azeri supplies could add to
these problems.
 Earlier on Friday, Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, reiterated
Russia's willingness to secure much higher gas volumes from
Azerbaijan as feedstock for its own pipeline project, South
Stream, for gas transit under the Black Sea to Europe.
 ""Our contract has no upper limit on the volume of gas
supplies from Azerbaijan,"" said Miller, adding this is the
second time the country has agreed to double the original base
contract for 500 million cubic metres, agreed in 2009.
 ""This (contract) means that Azerbaijan is giving priority to
Gazprom for the expansion of natural gas exports to Russia, the
reason for which is our territorial proximity and the already
existing gas pipeline infrastructure,"" said Miller.
 Analysts say Russia's recent energy dealings with Central
Asia's largest gas producer, Turkmenistan, show that giving
Russia preference as a buyer could be risky for Azerbaijan.
 ""As soon as a negative investment decision is given on
Nabucco, as soon as there is no more threat, Gazprom will stop
buying Azeri gas. This is what they did with Turkmenistan,"" said
oil analyst Korchemkin.
 Turkmenistan produces about 75 bcm of gas a year and, before
the economic downturn prompted a steep drop in global energy
demand, Russia was buying of bulk of its gas output, or 50 bcm.
 A pricing row between the countries then halted deliveries
for almost nine months in 2009. Russia agreed to resume Turkmen
gas imports, albeit at much lower volumes, late last year.
 Some industry experts say Nabucco cannot fill its total
capacity without supplies from Iran, but Nabucco says sources
from Turkmenistan, Iraq and Azerbaijan are plentiful. It has yet
to sign a binding supply agreement
 Russia and European Union-backed pipeline projects are now
competing to secure gas contracts from Azerbaijan's giant Shakh
Deniz II field, set to come onstream in 2016. 
 The Shakh Deniz gas deposit, co-led by BP and Statoil, has
total estimated reserves of around 1.2 trillion cubic metres and
should produce 7.6 bcm this year, up from 6.2 bcm in 2009.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Stocks jumped and commodities
rallied on Friday after data showed U.S. job losses were less
than expected in August, the second major report this week to
ease fears the American economy may slip back into recession.
 The price of government debt on both sides of the Atlantic
fell as the report on the U.S. labor market offered fresh
evidence that a double-dip recession may not be in the works.
Recent poor data had strongly suggested a double dip might be
ahead. For details see [ID:nN03391725] [ID:nLDE6821LQ]
 Private payrolls growth surprised on the upside, and U.S.
employment declined far less than expected, confounding the
market's gloomy prognosis in recent weeks on the U.S. economy.
 ""We're not growing very fast, but it doesn't suggest the
situation is continuing to deteriorate,"" said Nigel Gault,
chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts.
 ""It's not a great report, but it's a bit better than
expected, and it does not indicate that we're into some sort of
headlong plunge into a double dip,"" Gault said.
 Risky assets pared gains after a report on the U.S.
non-manufacturing sector grew below expectations in August,
even though it expanded for an eighth straight month.
 Copper prices hit a fresh four-month high and silver
climbed to its highest since March 2008 on the improved outlook
for economic growth.
 European shares hit a three-week closing high and the
benchmark S&P 500 index was close to posting its biggest weekly
gain in almost two months.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.9
percent and about 3.6 percent for the week -- its biggest
weekly gain since the week ended July 11.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 71.68
points, or 0.69 percent, at 10,391.78. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 8.56 points, or 0.79 percent, at
1,098.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 19.81
points, or 0.90 percent, at 2,219.82.
 While investors' appetite for risk rose on the payrolls
report, data on national services by The Institute for Supply
Management provided a mixed outlook for the economy.
 ""What we're seeing here is that the recovery continues to
bounce around. This supports our view that we're going to see a
below-average recovery, though the jobs data earlier today made
the case for a double-dip harder to make,"" said Channing Smith,
vice president of Capital Advisors in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
 Crude oil retreated after briefly rising on the jobs
report, and gold prices curbed losses of more than 1 percent to
trade lower on the services sector data.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell $1.31 to $73.71 a

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro and commodity currencies on Friday after surprisingly
strong U.S. jobs data eased worries about the outlook for the
economy and boosted appetite for riskier assets.
 The safe-haven yen and Swiss franc weakened broadly, while
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and Canadian
dollars gained as expectations grew the U.S. labor market may
not be as weak as many had feared.
 However, optimism about the U.S. economy faded somewhat
after separate data showed the non-manufacturing sector grew at
a slower-than-expected pace in August. That prompted major
currencies to consolidate in ranges as liquidity thinned ahead
of the Labor Day holiday weekend.
 ""Risk-on is definitely the trade today,"" said John Doyle,
senior currency strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
""And we've seen the dollar fall accordingly against the
higher-yielding currencies.""
 In midday trading, the ICE Futures U.S. dollar index
<.DXY>, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six
currencies, fell 0.4 percent to 82.122.
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell 54,000, the Labor Department
said, a much smaller drop than an expected decline of 100,000.
In addition, private employment, considered a better gauge of
labor market health, increased by 67,000.[ID:nN02227856]
 The euro traded at $1.2878 , up 0.4 percent. It also
gained 0.6 percent to 108.77 yen .
 The dollar earlier rallied more than 1 percent to a session
high of 85.22 yen , according to Reuters data. But it
pared most gains after the weaker-than-expected ISM services
data and last traded up 0.2 percent at 84.47 yen.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen on electronic
trading platform EBS late last month as fears the U.S. economic
recovery was stalling pushed U.S. Treasury yields lower.
 Investors have been reluctant to push the yen much higher
after Japanese authorities said they could take action --
normally a code word for intervention -- to stem yen strength.
 The euro jumped 0.9 percent to 1.3108 Swiss francs
, off an all-time low around 1.2850 earlier this week.
The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 1.0176 francs. 
 ""The yen and Swiss franc are both down against the
greenback, a 'text-book' example of a slip in safe-haven
support,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at
Wells Fargo in New York.
 CAUTION REMAINS
 Expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike next year grew
after the jobs data. Traders now see about a 68 percent chance
the Fed will increase its target interest rate at its Sept 2011
meeting, fed funds futures showed. [ID:nN03275974]
 The dollar had come under pressure in recent sessions as
speculation of more quantitative U.S. easing gained ground
following a raft of weak numbers. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has
said he is prepared to ease monetary policy further if the U.S.
economic slowdown worsens.
 While the jobs report might mitigate fears of a double-dip
recession, some analysts cautioned that the U.S. economy is
still in for a slow recovery.
 ""Just as trading on the bad U.S. data recently was
overdone, I think sentiment on this week's positive reports is
also going to be overdone,"" said Fabian Eliasson, vice
president of currency sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New
York. ""You have a lot of people unemployed, so it's a long way
back to normal.""
 An increase in risk appetite lifted commodity currencies.
The Australian dollar rose 0.6 percent to US$0.9158 ,
while the New Zealand dollar climbed 0.8 percent to US$0.7205
.
 The Canadian dollar hit a two-week high, with the greenback
falling 1.1 percent to C$1.0412 .

24,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2010 11:48AM ET</span>",Germany expects Swiss tax deal by end October," * Swiss to apply withholding tax to German assets
 * Swiss won't move to automatic exchange of information
 * Solution sought for long-standing untaxed German money
 
 By Catherine Bosley and Albert Schmieder
 BASEL, Switzerland, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Germany expects to
clinch by end-October a landmark tax deal with Berne aimed at
resolving the problem of an estimated 200 billion euros ($268
billion) of untaxed German wealth hidden in Switzerland.
 Germany, along with Italy, the United States and France, has
been one of the most fervent critics of Switzerland's banking
secrecy laws. Berlin has paid for stolen data from Swiss banks
to catch tax cheats and raided the German offices of
Switzerland's No.2 bank Credit Suisse.
 Under the planned deal, crucial to Switzerland's $2 trillion
offshore wealth management industry, Germany would accept the
Swiss applying a withholding tax on German assets in return for
more cooperation from Berne in tax evasion cases, German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Friday.
 But the Swiss will not automatically share bank information
with Germany, preserving some bank privacy.
 ""We want to have this done by the end of October. It will be
a combination of withholding tax and administrative assistance,""
Schaeuble said at an economics conference in Basel.
""We will also find a solution for the past,"" he added,
speaking of the so-called ""Schwarzgeld"" - untaxed money some
Germans have been hiding in secret Swiss accounts for decades.
 Schaeuble would give no further details of the planned deal,
but Swiss officials expected the withholding tax to be set at
the same level as the 25 percent Germany has for capital gains
and profit from share sales.
 ""Having Germany accept the principle of the withholding tax
is already a lot. They had always been sceptical,"" said a Swiss
official on condition of anonymity.
 The official added that the two countries had not yet agreed
on any firm detail on how to deal with the past.
 
 BLUEPRINT DEAL
 Tax experts say the agreement with Germany, Switzerland's
largest trading partner, would pave the way for similar deals
with other large European partners.
 Under pressure from an international crackdown on tax
evasion, Switzerland has committed to accepting no more untaxed
money in future.
 But finding a way of dealing with taxes not paid in the past
has proven more difficult.
 While cash-strapped Germany wants to go back as far as
possible to maximise revenue from untaxed wealth, Berne would
like to limit this to a few years.
 Schaeuble said the agreement should have the same
preventative power as the automatic exchange of tax-sensitive
information used among European Union member states.
 Switzerland is firmly opposed to moving to a regime of full
transparency of banking information, but made concessions over
its bank secrecy last year under pressure from G20 nations and
amid a bitter U.S. tax fraud investigation into Switzerland's
biggest bank UBS.

 * Finmin says Swedish economy well-balanced
 * Main risks come from weaker economies abroad - finmin
 * Sweden faces elections on Sept 19

(Adds quotes)
 By Daniel Dickson and Patrick Lannin
 STOCKHOLM, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Sweden's budget could be
balanced as soon as next year, Finance Minister Anders Borg said
on Friday, in a slightly more upbeat forecast for public
finances as the country approaches elections on Sept 19.
 The main risks to a bright outlook for Sweden's economy are
from abroad, while southern Europe remains a worry, he told
Reuters in an interview.
 The Nordic state has emerged in better shape from the global
economic crisis than most other European Union nations, but Borg
was wary of promising big tax handouts ahead of the election,
which is a close race between the centre-right coalition
government and the centre-left opposition.
 ""It now looks like we have quite a good chance to reach
balance next year and reach a surplus after that,"" Borg said, an
outlook that was a touch better than an Aug 20 government
forecast for a deficit of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2011.
""The Swedish economy domestically looks very well-balanced
... I do think that we still see quite substantial financial
market risks coming out of southern Europe,"" he said.
 ""We have drawn the conclusion that the risks are weighted on
the downside,"" he added, saying developments at home could be
stronger if the picture improves outside Sweden.
 The government recently raised its forecast for growth this
year to 4.5 percent.
 ""For economic policy, the central risk is that there will be
a more troublesome development in the outside world.""
 
 SOUTH EUROPE A WORRY
 Borg was cautious about plans for further tax cuts, saying
he wanted to build up a ""substantial surplus"" for when the next
global economic downturn came along.
 ""I want to have our house in order before that (next shock).
I want substantial surpluses before the next economic low.""
 Several key European countries are having to implement
austerity programmes to cut their deficits and debt, and the
European Union has set up a fund for possible rescues.
 ""There are still quite large vulnerabilities in the banking
system, especially in Spain,"" he added. He noted that financial
markets were becoming busier after the summer holiday lull.
 ""We can hope that we have reached a level of stability but
it is also quite clear that it will be challenging for these
governments to uphold the austerity programmes and restructuring
programmes,"" he added.
 ""I would still be quite cautious and keep our guard up.""

26,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2010 11:40AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Recent attacks on Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline," Sept 3 (Reuters) - The pipeline from Iraq's Kirkuk oilfield
to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, one of Iraq's largest crude oil
export lines, has been repeatedly attacked and has also suffered
regular maintenance problems.
 The 960 kilometre (600-mile) Kirkuk-Ceyhan link carries an
average of 500,000 barrels of oil a day, around a quarter of
Iraq's exports.
 Iraqi oil infrastructure is generally dilapidated following
decades of war, sanctions and underinvestment.
 A combination of sabotage and technical problems meant the
pipeline was mostly shut from the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq
until 2007.
 Following a period of relative calm after security
tightened, attacks have increased along the Iraqi and Turkish
parts of the pipeline route this year as detailed below:
 Aug. 12 - Iraq resumed oil exports through the Kirkuk-Ceyhan
pipeline two days after a bomb attack forced them to be halted.
 Turkey blamed the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),
which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for a
quarter of a century, for the bombing.
 The PKK ended a 14-month ceasefire in June.
 
 July 1 - Oil flows halted following a technical problem,
which was subsequently compounded by a suspected PKK rebel
attack.

 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Stocks jumped and the dollar
rallied on Friday after data showed U.S. job losses were less
than expected in August, the second major report this week to
ease fears the economy would slip back into recession.
 However, data on U.S. services companies showed the sector
grew at a rate that was below expectations in August, even as
it rose for an eighth straight month, leading investors to pare
riskier bets.
 Crude oil retreated after briefly rising on the jobs
report, and gold prices curbed losses of more than 1 percent to
trade lower on the services sector data.
 The U.S. dollar had rallied versus the yen after the U.S.
payrolls report but also trimmed gains after an index of
national services by The Institute for Supply Management fell,
providing a mixed outlook for the economy.
 ""What we're seeing here is that the recovery continues to
bounce around. This supports our view that we're going to see a
below-average recovery, though the jobs data earlier today made
the case for a double-dip harder to make,"" said Channing Smith,
vice president of Capital Advisors in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
 ""Still, the majority of data we've seen points to a slower
recovery,"" Smith said.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.8
percent on the day, and about 3.5 percent for the week -- its
biggest weekly gain since the week ended July 11.
 In midmorning, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 52.07 points, or 0.50 percent, at 10,372.17. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 5.98 points, or 0.55 percent, at
1,096.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 14.52
points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,214.53.
 U.S. Treasuries and German Bund futures pared losses on
news of U.S. non-manufacturing sector, which lifted demand for
safer haven government debt.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note , down a
full point earlier in the session, fell 20/32 in price to yield
2.70 percent after the ISM report.
 September Bund futures  rose to 132.02, gaining

 The safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc weakened while
higher-yielding currencies, such as the Australian dollar,
gained as the employment report fanned expectations the U.S.
labor market may not be as weak as many had feared.
 Gains, as in other risk assets, were later pared.
 The dollar was down against major currencies, with the U.S.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against a
basket of currencies on Friday after a surprisingly strong U.S.
jobs report eased worries about the outlook for the economy and
boosted appetite for riskier assets.
 The safe-haven yen and Swiss franc weakened broadly, while
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar gained
as expectations grew the U.S. labor market may not be as bad as
many had feared.
 U.S. non-farm payrolls fell 54,000, the Labor Department
said, a much smaller drop than expectations for a decline of
100,000. In addition private employment, considered a better
gauge of labor market health, increased 67,000. For details,
see [ID:nN02227856]
 Optimism about the economy, however, faded slightly after
separate data showed the U.S. non-manufacturing sector grew at
a slower-than-expected pace in August and that the sector's
employment shrank that month.
 ""This does take some of the shine off of today's
better-than-expected payrolls report,"" said Michael Woolfolk,
senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the
greenback versus a basket of six currencies, last fell 0.3
percent to 82.226.
 The dollar earlier rallied more than 1 percent to a session
high of 85.22 yen , according to Reuters data. It pared
most gains after the weaker-than-expected ISM services data and
last traded up 0.2 percent at 84.42 yen.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen on electronic
trading platform EBS late last month on fears the U.S. economic
recovery was stalling.
 The euro traded at $1.2855 , up 0.2 percent. It also
gained 0.4 percent to 108.52 yen .
 While the jobs report might mitigate fears of a double-dip
recession, some analysts cautioned that the U.S. economy is
still in for a slow recovery.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2010 09:52AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Poised for a risk rally?," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - With little fanfare, equity
markets have started to rally, investors have become sated with
government bonds and cash levels are high enough to prompt a
search for better yield.
 Heading into a new week, it is time to ask whether investors
are adequately positioned for a potential return to risk.
 Reuters global asset allocation polls, published in the past
week, show equity holdings among leading international investors
at the lowest level in at least 6 years and bond holdings at the
highest.
 But in both cases, the pace of decline/rise was levelling
off. 
 With cash a solid 5.8 percent of portfolios, this reflects a
highly cautious state, but also one that could be taken as a
contrarian indicator. Indeed, ING said that money markets saw a
$4.1 billion outflow in the week to Sept. 1.
 Some technical analysts, meanwhile, are scenting a shift in
the wind.
 ""Bearish sentiment is pervasive, fear is elevated,
conviction is non-existent, confidence is broken, volumes are
anaemic, yields de minimus ... the perfect recipe for an
incendiary advance,"" Richard Ross, global technical analyst at
U.S.-based brokerage Auerbach Grayson, wrote to clients.
 There are some signs of change. World stocks as measured by
MSCI have risen more than five percent in a little over a week
as investors have returned from the Northern hemisphere summer
break.
 They are still down 3 percent for the year, but 10 percent
above their 2010 low.
 The frenzy for government bonds, meanwhile, is easing as
yields have tumbled. The Reuters polls show allocations to the
sector dropping to 55.8 percent in August from 61.2 percent
three months earlier.
 Instead, investors have been snapping up investment grade
corporate debt, still a defensive play, but further up the risk
food chain. And some have been running from government debt in
anticipation of a sell-off.
 ""We sold our 30-, 25- and 10-year bonds last (week),""
Charlie Morris, head of absolute returns at HSBC Global Asset
Management told Reuters.
""We think that the big (government bond) rally over the past
three months is nothing to do with deflation at all. It is a
short squeeze ... by hedge fund managers. So the thing to do is
sell your bonds.""
 
 CAUTION 
 Taking heavily cautious positions, of course, is no
guarantee that things are about to turn around. There is no
reason why investors cannot become more cautious.
 But the indications are that a level has been reached.
 The CBOE Volatility Index, the implied volatility measure of
the S&P 500 index, settled into a range in July and August that
implies some risk aversion but not retreat.
 The index was at 23 on Friday, more than 50 percent below
its risk averse May high.
 ""Vols have certainly come back to the lower end of the
range,"" said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset
Management. ""Equities (also) look very cheap on a risk premium
basis to bonds.""
 But he said countering this are mixed macroeconomic data --
U.S. jobs data on Friday was better than expected -- and
questions about whether central banks are going to embark on a
new round of quantitative easing, essentially buying bonds.
 Some focus on the latter is expected in the coming week when
the Bank of England meets, although it is far from clear that
the UK economy is in enough trouble to warrant action.
 July trade numbers from across Europe are also due,
following on from World Trade Organisation data showing world
trade volumes up 25 percent in the first half of the year.
 Europe's economy has been expected to slow but a
surprisingly robust Germany appears to be dragging at least some
of its peers along with it.
 A generally unspoken issue, in the meantime, is what impact
the mid-term elections -- early next month and seen as punishing
President Barack Obama's Democrats -- may be having on U.S.
markets.
 ""Since 1914, the Dow (.DJI has gained 49.2 percent on
average from its mid-term election year low to its subsequent
high in the following election year,"" Auerbach Grayson's Ross
noted.

 * Poor South Africans bear the brunt of strike
 * Hard task convincing workers to end strike, analyst
(Adds COSATU, analyst comments) 
 By Jon Herskovitz and Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Striking South African
state workers held small-scale protests on Friday as union and
government negotiators prepared for bargaining next week aimed
at ending the three-week walkout by about 1.3 million.
 The unions rejected a government offer of 7.5 percent pay
raises, nearly double inflation, and 800 rand a month for
housing, with workers demanding a better offer.
 The parties have a bargaining session planned for Monday
where they will try to find a way to end the strike that has
been the biggest in terms of lost man days in three years.
 The strike has hit hardest the legions of poor who depend on
state services to live and has quashed the euphoria the country
felt after hosting the June-to-July soccer World Cup.
 ""It can go either way on Monday. But whatever the outcome it
will be a united position from COSATU and the independent
unions,"" said a union spokesman who did not want to be named.
 The unions, who represent court clerks, prison guards,
customs officials and nurses, are seeking pay rises of 8.6
percent and 1,000 rand a month for housing. Most are affiliated
with COSATU, the country's largest labour federation.
 ""Both parties have dug themselves into supposed final
positions, which to some extent will become an obstacle to
bringing the strike to an end,"" said labour lawyer Tony Healy.
 Government officials said the state cannot afford the offer
it has already put on the table and there is no more room in the
budget to increase its offer, which would swell state spending
by about one percent.
 ""The one certainty is that the strike will not be resolved
on the basis of labour's current demands,"" Healy said.
 Union leaders have said they understand the government's
financial constraints and will try to convince rank and file to
accept the deal.
 COSATU planned a Friday strategy meeting to discuss the deal
with its members, the more militant of which, analysts said, may
not want to budge and could drag the strike out even longer,
defying the wishes of union leaders, analysts said.
 ""We are going as quickly as we can and will make an
announcement when members give us their mandate. I am not sure
when that will be,"" COSATU's President Sidumo Dlamini told
Reuters. 
 Pay and benefits are the biggest expenditure category in the
state budget. In 2006/07, about 35 percent of tax revenue went
towards it. That rose to about 47 percent in 2009/10.
 ""A greater volume of taxpayer money will have to be spent on
state employees, thereby detracting from much needed expenditure
on improving education, health, transport and infrastructure,""
said NKC Independent Economists economist Christie Viljoen.
 COSATU put on hold a plan to have all its near two million
members in vital industries including mining, go on a sympathy
strike to allow the state workers to consider the new offer.
 A prolonged strike by all COSATU members would put enormous
pressure on the government to reach a deal to prevent any major
blow to Africa's largest economy.
 The strike has seen South Africans volunteering at hospitals
and the private sector filling gaps left by striking workers.
 Emergency service provider Netcare said it treated about 730
patients stranded by the strike, costing about 15 million rand.

 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rallied versus
the yen on Friday after a government report showed U.S.
employment fell by far less than expected in August and private
payrolls growth was surprisingly strong.
 The dollar jumped 1 percent to trade above 85 yen as the
data fueled expectations the U.S. labor market is not as bad as
feared and helped lift U.S. Treasury securities yields.
 ""These are very nice numbers for the labor market,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York.
""It means for the time being, some of the fears of weakness in
the U.S. economy may be misplaced.""
 The dollar rose to 85.22 yen , according to Reuters

about 1 percent on the day, moving further away from a 15-year

for risk. The euro zone single currency was last at $1.2837

32,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2010 08:52AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Beer finds favour over spirits in slow recovery," * Beer favoured over spirits in uneven recovery
 * Brewers have bigger exposure to emerging markets
 * Near term growth prospects seen better for brewers
 * Spirits groups find growth tough to find
 
 By David Jones
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Big brewers like Anheuser Busch
InBev are seen as a better bet than spirit giants Diageo and
Pernod Ricard to gain from the uneven world recovery in which
only emerging markets are showing strong growth.
 The brewers are slaking more thirsts in Latin America, Asia
and Africa as drinkers turn first to beer rather than more
expensive spirits as economic growth picks up, while fears over
a big jump in the price of grain to make beer are overdone.
 Meanwhile, the big spirits groups have less exposure to
emerging markets than the beer companies and have struggled with
weak European sales, especially in Spain and Greece, and as
drinkers have sought out cheaper whisky and vodka in recession.
 Pernod has shown stronger profits growth than its bigger
rival Diageo but its share performance has been dull compared
with the big brewers who have seen a big boost from buoyant beer
markets in places as far apart as Brazil and China.
 ""We struggle to see why the marginal buyer would prefer
spirits and Pernod to beer and AB InBev,"" said analyst Rob Mann
at brokers Collins Stewart.
 Analyst Mike Gibbs at JP Morgan Cazenove says he continues
to prefer the brewers to the distillers and believes AB InBev
deserves a significant premium to reflect its low risk, very
strong cash flow and improving top line sales outlook.
 The world's top four brewers AB InBev, SABMiller, Heineken
and Carlsberg already trade on a premium to the globe's top two
spirits group Diageo and Pernod, and some think the gap could
widen further.
 Belgium-based AB InBev, the brewer of Budweiser, Stella
Artois and Beck's, has a 50-50 earnings split between emerging
and mature markets and has bought forward its grain need for
2010 and 2011 which protects it from higher input costs.
 Its exposure to mature markets is heavily weighed to the
United States which accounts for 42 percent of group profit and
although beer volume growth is sluggish there, the group expects
to raise beer prices in the second half of this year.
 Analysts say modest sales growth at the group will be
translated into strong double digit earnings growth by cost
savings and debt reduction following its $50 billion acquisition
of U.S. brewer Anheuser Busch in November 2008.
 Other brewers are upbeat with Miller Lite and Peroni brewer
SABMiller, which earns over 80 percent of its profits from
emerging markets, saying its beer volumes turned positive in
June, while Heineken will gain from its acquisition of Mexican
brewer FEMSA and Carlsberg from better trading in Russia.
 This has seen AB InBev shares trade at 17.5 times forecast
2010 earnings, with SABMiller on 16.6, Heineken on 14.6 and
Carlsberg 15.9, all ahead of Pernod and Diageo on 14.2 and 13.9
for their financial year to end-June 2011.
 Analysts say the four big brewers have larger exposure to
fast-growing emerging markets than the two spirits groups and
higher underlying sales growth while they have been quick to
slash costs and put up price in West Europe and North America.
 Both Diageo and Pernod only have around one third of their
sales in emerging markets and have struggled in the tough
markets of southern Europe like Spain and Greece and see little
uptick in the big United States spirits market.
 Both showed underlying sales growth of 2 percent in their
financial years to end-June 2010, but Pernod translated that to
a 4 percent operating profit growth compared with Diageo's 2
percent helped by the French group's bigger exposure to
fast-growing Asian markets.
 Analysts say Pernod's higher profit growth compared with
Diageo is offset somewhat by concerns over its debts of 10.6
billion euros ($14.2 billion) which were heightened by its
takeover of Absolut vodka maker Vin & Sprit in 2008. Diageo,
which has a market value twice that of Pernod, has debts of
almost 7 billion pounds ($10.8 billion).
 Graeme Eadie at UniCredit Bank is another analyst to favour
the brewers as he sees them as less risky stocks with better
growth prospects.
 ""While Pernod appears to be weathering the economic downturn
better than its spirits peers, we still think it is too early to
be positive on the stock given the high level of debt and the
prospect of modest organic profit growth,"" Eadie said.

 * Says will not ""blackmail"" Russia
 * Previous dispute disrupted Gazrpom's supplies to Europe
 
(Adds context, background)
 KIEV, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola
Azarov urged Russia on Friday to cut gas prices for its
neighbour, saying their current deal was unacceptable and would
not work for its full 10-year term.
 Bringing memories of previous ""gas wars"" between the two
ex-Soviet nations that disrupted supplies to Europe, Azarov said
Ukraine would find a way to change the price even if Russia
refused to do so -- but added, ""We will never do blackmail"".
 A January 2009 agreement between Russian gas giant Gazprom
and Ukraine state energy firm Naftogaz set a base formula for
the price of Russian gas, which the Ukrainians say is onerous
despite a discount agreed last April.
 ""We are in talks (with Russia), and we are saying that if
our call is not heard, we will think of some other mechanisms
but will not work for 10 years with this contract,"" Azarov told
a briefing.
 ""The Russian side understands this, but the longer they keep
it in place the more profitable it is for them.""
 But he quickly added that Ukraine, which also transits
Russian gas to Europe, would not blackmail Russia in order to
revise the deal.
 Reacting to a similar statement by Azarov last month,
Russian gas monopoly Gazprom said it could cut the gas price if
Ukraine agreed to merge Naftogaz with Gazprom -- something Kiev
is not keen to do.
 President Viktor Yanukovich's administration has already
secured a $100 discount on the price of 1,000 cubic metres of
gas in exchange for allowing Russia to keep its Black Sea fleet
in a Ukrainian port until 2042.
 Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, which
last month opened a $15 billion credit line to Ukraine, the
Azarov government has announced austerity measures including a
50 percent rise in the price of gas for households.

 * Spain's service sector contract anew, UK growth lower
 * U.S. service sector expansion seen slowing
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Global service sector surveys
highlighted a growing divergence in economic recovery on Friday
with a pick up in growth in China and Germany but slowdowns in
Britain and Spain and an expected deceleration in the United
States.
 The data follows sister surveys which earlier this week
painted a similar picture for the manufacturing sector although
signs of expansion in China and the U.S. revived some investor
confidence.
 China's service sector expanded at its fastest pace in four
months in August on the back of strong domestic demand but the
headline figure was below the long-run average of the series.
 HSBC said its Purchasing Managers' Index for Chinese
services, which account for much less of output than in more
developed countries, rose to 57.6 in August from 56.3 in July.
 The pace of recovery in the 16-nation euro zone, whose
economy is heavily weighted to the service sector, was barely
changed in August from July but signalled a growing split, with
a pick up in Germany offset by Spain sliding back into
contractionary territory.
 Markit's Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index for
the service sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the
euro zone economy, nudged up to 55.9 in August from 55.8 in July
-- a strong overall reading.
 ""The surveys highlight the uneven performance of the euro
zone economies, with Germany currently performing very well,
France decently, Italy growing modestly and Spain and Ireland
still struggling to develop recovery,"" said Howard Archer, chief
European economist at IHS Global Insight.
 The bloc's economy expanded 1.0 in the second quarter over
the first, its fastest pace in more than three years, although
that was really a reflection of German resurgence.
 Spain's services PMI fell to 49.2, the first time the index
has slipped below the 50.0 line that separates growth from
contraction since February.
 And Britain saw its dominant service sector activity grow
last month at its slowest pace since April 2009, with a marked
fall in hiring as employers worried about an economic slowdown
and public spending cuts.
 The headline Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index
dropped to 51.3 in August from July's 53.1, a much sharper fall
than the decline to 52.9 forecast in a Reuters poll.
 Governments are turning their focus to slashing budgets as
they face up to paying off the billions of dollars pumped into
economies to drag them out of the worst post-war recession.
 
 PAYROLLS FORECAST TO FALL AGAIN
 A similar index for the United States, due later on Friday,
is expected to show a slowing growth rate for services in the
world's biggest economy but all eyes will be on U.S. jobs
numbers at 1230 GMT.
 A reluctance by firms to add staff amid the economic
uncertainty and relentless layoffs at cash-strapped state and
local governments is expected to produce a third straight month
of decline in non-farm payrolls.
 ""In the euro zone there is not at the moment the risk of a
double dip, a risk that instead is present in the United
States,"" Hans-Werner Sinn, president of Germany's IFO economic
research institute, told reporters in Cernobbio, Italy.
 U.S. growth braked to a 1.6 percent annualized rate in the
second quarter after a brisk 3.7 percent in Q1.
 With unemployment stuck near 10 percent and the impact of
the government's $862 billion economic stimulus fading,
investors worry that even if the U.S. economy avoids a
double-dip recession it may face a period of near-stagnation.
 The big question is whether Asia and Europe's biggest powers
could carry on prospering or would inevitably be dragged down by
the world's largest economy, whose markets they are still
heavily reliant on for export demand.

 (Adds detail, updates prices)
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled on Friday
while the euro crept up before U.S. employment data which is
expected to show more job losses and may fuel dollar selling but
also heighten risk aversion.
 Reflecting low appetite for risk due to worries about a
slowdown in the U.S. and global economies, the yen was locked
near a 15-year high against the dollar and the Swiss franc
hovered within range of a record peak against the euro.
 Data due at 1230 GMT is expected to show U.S. non-farm
payrolls fell 100,000 in August, following a loss of 131,000 in
July. Figures earlier in the week showed a surprising decrease
in private sector jobs last month.
 Currencies were little changed in early European trade, as
investors were wary of taking on big positions ahead of the jobs
data. Market participants said traders were short of dollars
heading into the figures. 
 ""If the figure does not provide a massive surprise to the
upside, it will support the market's view that the Fed will not
raise rates for a very long time,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 He added that this would also raise speculation the Fed may
implement more quantitative easing to boost the economy, which
would be negative for the dollar.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said he is prepared to ease
monetary policy further if the U.S. economic slowdown worsened.
 Some in the market said a weak jobs reading may increase
risk aversion, which could drive the euro and growth-linked
currencies lower.
 By 0926 GMT, the euro was little changed on the day at
$1.2835, hovering near a two-week high around $1.2855 hit
earlier in the week. Traders said the single currency's upside
was capped by offers from semi-official European names.
 Stop-loss orders seen at $1.2850 were limiting euro moves,
while option expiries later in the day were littered in the
$1.2800-$1.2900 region.
 
 DOLLAR/YEN UPSIDE RISK?
 The dollar was a touch lower on the day against a basket of
currencies at 82.363.
 The U.S. currency inched up to 84.40 yen, but hovered in
range of a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit late last month.
 ""There are said to be some stop-losses and option triggers
around 83.50. So it could get ugly if the dollar/yen hits that
level after the payroll data,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst at
Mitsubishi-Tokyo UFJ Bank in Tokyo.
 The euro rose to 0.3 percent to 1.3030, but it stayed in
range of an all-time low of 1.2850 earlier this week. The dollar
was at 1.0150 francs, up 0.2 percent.
 Investors often favour the low-yielding yen and Swiss franc
when they want to avoid losses rather than seek higher returns.
 The U.S. dollar was slightly higher at C$1.0544, recovering
from the day's low C$1.0519 hit after Russia's central bank said
will soon be ready to invest its currency reserves in Canadian
dollars.
 Traders have cited growing demand for short-dated options to
buy dollar/yen this week, suggesting investors are keen to
protect their short dollar positions against sudden bounces even
though they see the greenback staying weak.
 As a result, options traders said risk reversals, the
premium required to hold a put or a call in a currency, are
skewed towards yen puts in the one-week tenor at around 0.6,
shifting from 1.0 in favour of yen calls a week ago.
 Investors have become cautious about bidding the yen too
much after Japanese ministers said they could take action --
normally a code word for intervention -- to stem yen strength.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2010 06:00AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Conundrum: M&A/credit binge vs double-dip fear," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A new conundrum faces financial
markets -- why, if the global economy is heading back into
trouble, are companies on an M&A binge and big investors
snapping up so much corporate debt?
 At one level, the answer would seem to point to a world of
short-term worries that are not seen likely to come to pass or,
even if they do, will not derail longer-term growth prospects.
 But there are also specific reasons for the moves that paint
a less stable picture. It may be another case of there being
just so much money around that it has to go somewhere.
 Data from Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research shows
worldwide M&A deals coming in at $267 billion in August, the
biggest monthly activity since June last year and the most
active August since 1999, at the height of the internet boom.
 Deals include BHP Billiton's hostile takeover offer for
fertiliser company Potash, GDF Suez Energy's deal with
International Power, and Genzyme's likely merger with
Sanofi-Aventis
 At the same time, investors have been buying investment
grade corporate bonds with no apparent concern that a U.S.
slowdown and contagion elsewhere could hurt companies' finances
(in much the same way that earnings projections remain robust).
 Reuters asset allocation polls for August showed mild moves
away from equities and into bonds in general. But moves within
bonds were decidedly in favour of high-quality corporate credit.
 Within bond allocations in a typical mixed fund, 27.4
percent was in investment grade at the end of August compared
with 19.9 percent three months ago.
 Meanwhile, the costs of insuring U.S. and European
investment grade debt against default has come down over summer,
according to Markit, despite some increases in August.
 
 LOOKING BEYOND U.S. TO EMERGING WORLD
 The M&A spree certainly suggests corporate treasurers are
confident that whatever the near term may bring, now is the time
to expand.
 A survey by law firm Eversheds found one in five senior
executives said their business would be looking at potential
acquisitions during the next year.
 Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at wealth manager Brewin
Dolphin, reckons many companies are taking advantage of
relatively good valuations to position themselves for the new
world economy being led by Asia and Latin America.
 While the U.S. economy struggles, investors hopes are pinned
on new, vibrant, emerging competitors to pick up the slack over
the short term. Over the long term, these economies are seen as
the new leaders, with domestic markets primed to explode.
 ""These guys are around for the long term,""Lenhoff said of
the corporate buyers. ""They are going for the emerging world.""
 He cited BHP Billiton's bid for Potash. China's need for
fertiliser is so large the country is trying to find ways to
hamper the deal over worries about market concentration.
 But other corporate activity has involved companies that may
simply have found themselves loaded with cash and/or able to get
hold of as much as they need cheaply.
 ""Obviously they think things are going to pan out, otherwise
they would not do it,"" Lothar Mentel, chief investment officer
of Octopus Investments, said.
 But he added: ""There is so much money at the upper end of
the financial system, we are almost concerned that they might be
tempted to buy something silly.""
 So while the M&A surge implies belief that the global
economy will not fall back too far, it may be just as much a
reaction to the very wave of money unleashed by governments to
pull the world out of recession.
 And, as Goldman Sachs points out, overall M&A activity this
year ""remains well below the heady days of 2008"".
 
 RELATIVE RISK
 The picture is similar when it comes to corporate debt. On
one level, buying investment grade bonds is a sign of faith in
the future -- look at the sell-off in such debt during the
subprime/Lehman crisis for what happens when it is not there.
 But it is only a mild form of risk appetite.
 ""Buying corporate debt is still a risk asset, but it is a
more defensive way of playing it,"" Brewin Dolphin's Lenhoff
said.
 Some money has moved from lower grade, higher yielding
""junk"" to investment grade. The high-yield allocation in the
Reuters polls dropped from 10.3 percent in June to 8.5 in
August.
 And the investment grade rally may be being driven less by
risk appetite than a fear government bonds are now so overbought
that corporates present a better alternative.
 ""They are getting out (of governments) and they have to put
their money somewhere,"" said Octopus's Mentel.
 It all leaves investors pretty much where they were at the
beginning of summer -- trying to work out whether the signals
they see are telling them all is well or whether they merely
reflect the money that has been put to work, not fundamental
economic improvement.
 If they get it wrong bond investors could end up nursing big
losses and some company executives will find they've overpaid
for acquisitions.

 * Gains capped as investors brace for U.S. jobs data
 * Dollar on back foot vs other currencies 
 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - European stocks edged higher on
Friday after U.S. shares climbed, but the dollar struggled as
markets braced for a key U.S. labour report expected to show
more job losses, clouding the outlook for recovery.
 U.S. non-farm payrolls likely took a hit from a combination
of a fading boost from census hiring, companies' reluctance to
hire staff and further layoffs at cash-strapped state and local
governments.
 Surprisingly strong U.S. manufacturing data earlier this
week had dispelled some gloom about faltering growth, but
investors were far from convinced all is well.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 percent, on
course for a rise of 3 percent over the week. World stocks as
measured by the MSCI were up 0.6 percent, propped up by the
gains in European and Asian shares.
 ""People are watching the growth in (U.S.) private sector
employment, which is likely to be too low to be good enough for
the economy,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at
NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 ""The market is going up on relatively unconvincing economic
data. It just needs to know there won't be a double dip.""
 Underscoring simmering angst about U.S. growth, the yen
remained locked close to a 15-year high against the dollar and
the Swiss franc near a record peak against the euro.
 The U.S. currency traded flat at 84.27 yen by 0835 GMT,
hovering in range of a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit late last
month.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a touch lower
on the day at 82.42.
 Market participants said traders were short of dollars
heading into the figures due at 1230 GMT expected to show U.S.
non-farm payrolls fell 100,000 in August following a loss of
131,000 the previous month.

 FED SPECULATION
 ""If the figure does not provide a massive surprise to the
upside, it will support the market's view that the Fed will not
raise rates for a very long time,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 He added that this would also raise speculation the Federal
Reserve may implement more quantitative easing to boost the
economy, which would be negative for the dollar.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices were mostly steady in Europe with
traders focused on whether the jobs data would provide a
catalyst for a further rebound in the benchmark 10-year yield
from last week's 19-month low. The 10-year T-note yield was last
unchanged on the day at 2.627 percent while German 10-year bond
yields were up 1 basis point at 2.293 percent. Bond prices and
yields move inversely.
 Commodity prices barely budged. Gold was little changed at
$1,251.05 an ounce but oil fell for the first day in three as
Hurricane Earl neared the country's east coast, fuelling
concerns of disruptions to refineries and demand during the
Labour Day long weekend. U.S. crude was last down 0.5 percent at
74.63 a barrel.

 * Poor South Africans bear the brunt of strike
 * Higher spending needed for wage deal concerns economists
 
 By Jon Herskovitz and Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Striking South African
state workers held small-scale protests on Friday as union and
government negotiators prepared for bargaining next week aimed
at ending the three-week walkout by about 1.3 million.
 The unions rejected a government offer of 7.5 percent pay
raises, nearly double inflation, and 800 rand a month for
housing, with workers demanding a better offer.
 The parties have a bargaining session planned for Monday
where they will try to find a way to end the strike that has
been the biggest in terms of lost man days in three years.
 The strike has hit hardest the legions of poor who depend on
state services to live and has quashed the euphoria the country
felt after hosting the June-to-July soccer World Cup.
 ""It can go either way on Monday. But whatever the outcome it
will be a united position from COSATU and the independent
unions,"" said a union spokesman who did not want to be named.
 The unions, who represent court clerks, prison guards,
customs officials and nurses, are seeking pay rises of 8.6
percent and 1,000 rand a month for housing. Most are affiliated
with COSATU, the country's largest labour federation.
 Government officials said the state cannot afford the
offer they have already put on the table and there is no more
room in the budget to increase its offer, which would swell
state spending by about one percent.
 ""A greater volume of taxpayer money will have to be spent on
state employees, thereby detracting from much needed expenditure
on improving education, health, transport and infrastructure,""
said NKC Independent Economists economist Christie Viljoen.
 Pay and benefits is the biggest expenditure category in the
state budget. In 2006/07, about 35 percent of tax revenue went
towards it. That rose to about 47 percent in 2009/10.
 COSATU put on hold a plan to have all its near two million
members in vital industries including mining, go on a sympathy
strike to allow the state workers to consider the new offer.
 A prolonged strike by all COSATU members would put enormous
pressure on the government to reach a deal to prevent any major
blow to Africa's largest economy.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled on Friday
while the euro and other higher-risk currencies were off the
day's highs as investors braced for weak U.S. jobs data that may
fuel more risk aversion.
 Reflecting simmering worries about a slowdown in the U.S.
and global economies, the yen was locked near a 15-year high
against the dollar and the Swiss franc hovered near a record
peak against the euro.

 By 0741 GMT, the euro was little changed on the day at
$1.2820, hovering near a two-week high around $1.2855 hit

 The next target for the euro was around $1.2873 -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from its August peak
around $1.3334 to its August low near $1.2588. The target after
that would be $1.2923, touched on Aug. 18.
 
 DOLLAR/YEN UPSIDE RISK?

 * New orders index rises, helped by strong showing in France
 * August composite PMI slips slightly from July
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The pace of recovery in the euro
zone's dominant service sector barely changed in August from
July, according to a business survey that showed growth of the
bloc's wider private sector slowed slightly last month.
 The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
which measures changes in activity at thousands of companies
ranging from hotels to banks, showed order books growing and
companies hiring staff at a marginally faster rate in August.
 The main index for activity in the service sector, which
accounts for roughly two-thirds of the euro zone economy, rose
to 55.9 in August from 55.8 in July, slightly higher than an
earlier flash estimate of 55.6.
 Marking its 12th month above the 50 mark that divides growth
from contraction, recent surveys suggest the service sector's
expansion has reached a plateau. The headline figure has wavered
in a range between 55.5 and 56.2 over the last five months.
 ""The final PMI reading suggests that the service sector
recovery held its ground in August, with growth of activity so
far in the third quarter in line with that seen on average in
Q2,"" said Rob Dobson of survey compiler Markit.
 The 16-nation euro zone economy expanded 1.0 in the second
quarter over the first, its fastest pace in more than three
years, although the strong reading was really a reflection of
German and French resurgence.
 The latest batch of services PMIs from the euro zone's
individual countries did little to dispel fears of a two-speed
recovery in Europe.
 German service sector activity picked up in August and the
French survey showed rocketing growth in fresh orders, helping
the overall euro zone PMI new business index rise to 54.9 in
August from July's 53.1.
 Conversely, the euro zone's No.4 economy Spain saw an
unexpected decline in service sector activity last month, with
its PMI index dipping below 50 after five months of positive
momentum.
 ""The main concern remains the continued dependence of the
recovery on France and Germany, with rates of activity expansion
for the big two still far-and-away above those seen on average
elsewhere,"" said Dobson.
 The euro zone composite PMI index, which combines the
surveys from both the services and the manufacturing sectors,
fell slightly in August to 56.2 from 56.7 the previous month,
although a little higher than the flash estimate of 56.1.
 The composite employment index rose to 51.7 from 51.4 in
July, extending a recent trend of jobs growth to four months.
 European Union statistics on Tuesday showed the rate of
unemployment across the euro zone held steady at 10 percent in
August. While hiring increased in Germany, joblessness grew in
Belgium, Spain and Ireland. 
 ""Further job creation in August alongside faster growth of
new business and improving service sector confidence ... bode
well for the coming months,"" said Dobson.
 Economists polled by Reuters last month said a double-dip
recession was unlikely, although euro area growth will slow
markedly in coming quarters. 
 On Thursday, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet warned of uncertainties about growth prospects in some
advanced economies and the ""emergence of renewed tensions in
financial markets"" as downside risks to the growth outlook.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The euro and high-yielding
currencies held firm on Friday after an improvement in U.S.
housing and jobless claims data bolstered investor appetite for
risk ahead of key U.S. jobs data due later in the day.
 Still, reflecting simmering worries about a slowdown in the
U.S. and global economies, the yen was locked near a 15-year high
against the dollar and the Swiss franc hovered near a record peak
against the euro.
 The two low-yielding currencies tend to be favoured when
investors want to avoid losses rather than seek higher returns,
despite efforts by their governments to stem currency strength.
 ""Market players have been building up positions for some time
to brace for a weak U.S. recovery. So I guess that any upside
surprise in the payrolls data could move the market,"" said
Daisuke Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The euro changed hands at $1.2825, flat on the day and within
sight of this week's high of $1.2856 hit on Wednesday.
 Positive news on the U.S. economy and rises in global shares
have tended to help the euro and higher-yielding currencies more
than the dollar in recent months, as investors increasingly see
the greenback as a funding currency for investments on
expectations of a prolonged period of near zero rates in the U.S.
 The next target for the euro was around $1.2873 -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from its August peak
around $1.3334 to its August low near $1.2588. The target after
that would be $1.2923, touched on Aug. 18.
 Pending U.S. home resales rose unexpectedly in July and new
claims for unemployment insurance fell for a second straight
week, which, together with upbeat manufacturing data on
Wednesday, eased the gloom over the economy.
 The dollar/yen stood at 84.35 yen per dollar, up slightly on
the day but not far from the 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit late
last month.
 ""There are said to be some stop-losses and option triggers
around 83.50. So it could get ugly if the dollar/yen hits that
level after the payroll data,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst at
Mitsubishi-Tokyo UFJ Bank.
 While the yen's persistent strength -- which comes despite
Japan's own economic problems such as low growth and high debt --
may suggest investors are positioned for poor U.S. payroll
figures, there are also some signs of opposite moves to prepare
for positive surprises in the data.
 RISK REVERSALS
 There has been some demand for dollar/yen calls with strike
prices around 85.50-86.00 yen this week, which could be attempts
to gain on a possible jump after the jobs data, or even in the
event of intervention.
 Reflecting these moves, one-week dollar risk reversals show
the price of dollar calls is on par with, or slightly higher
than, dollar puts.
 That is unusual -- it has happened only once in the last two
years -- as dollar/yen risk reversals are almost always skewed in
favour of dollar puts because of Japanese exporters' constant
needs to hedge against falls in the dollar.
 Traders are also getting cautious about bidding the yen too
much after Japanese ministers said they could take action --
normally a code word for intervention -- to stem the yen's
strength since late last week.
 Still, many traders have doubts over whether Tokyo will step
into the forex market now given that Tokyo could have trouble
convincing other G7 members about the need to intervene at a time
when they are calling on China to make the yuan more flexible to
ease global imbalances.
 A sharp drop in dollar/yen, such as 1 to 2 percent or more in
a single day towards the 80 yen level and below, is seen as the
most likely scenario that would prompt Japan to stick its neck
out and buy dollars.
 Thus many traders expect the market to test the willingness
of Japan to intervene, especially if the U.S. payrolls data comes
in weaker than expected.
 Economists expect a decline of 100,000 jobs overall, and a
rise of 41,000 private-sector jobs in August.
 While better-than-expected figures would lift investor risk
appetite, some market players also say they could diminish
expectations of more easing by the Federal Reserve, possibly
boosting U.S. bond yields. That in turn could help the dollar.
 The Swiss franc traded at 1.2987 franc per euro, not far from
a record high of 1.2850 hit earlier this week. The Swiss central
bank intervened in markets earlier this year to curb the franc's
rise but has had little success.
 Against the dollar, the Swiss currency stood at 1.0131 franc
per dollar, near a nine-month peak of 1.0065 marked earlier in
the week.
 The Australian dollar, which boasts the highest yield among
major currencies, traded at $0.9100, after having risen $0.9122
on Thursday, its highest in about three weeks.

 * C.banker warns against monetary system dominated by dollar
 * Says China will work to promote yuan as alternative
(Adds comments, details) 
 By Zhou Xin and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - China on Friday offered a rare
glimpse into its foreign exchange reserves, confirming that they
are overwhelmingly allocated in dollars, while a central banker
said the mountain of cash could face depreciation risks.
 The Chinese government's currency reserves, the world's
largest such stockpile at $2.45 trillion, are held roughly in
line with what was described as the global average: 65 percent in
dollars, 26 percent in euros, 5 percent in pounds and 3 percent
in yen.
 The report in the China Securities Journal, an official
newspaper, cited unnamed reserve managers.
 The allocation of Chinese foreign exchange reserves is
considered to be a state secret, but analysts have long estimated
that about two-thirds are invested in dollar assets.
 Separately, Hu Xiaolian, a vice governor with the People's
Bank of China, warned that depreciation loomed as a risk for
foreign exchange reserves held by developing counties.
 ""Once a reserve currency's value becomes unstable, there will
be quite large depreciation risks for assets,"" she wrote in an
article that appeared in the latest issue of China Finance, a
Chinese-language magazine published under the central bank.
 She reiterated China's long-standing discomfort with a global
financial system dominated by a single currency in the dollar.
 ""The outbreak and spread of the global financial crisis has
highlighted the inherent deficiencies and systemic risks in the
current international currency system,"" she said.
 ""A diversified international currency system will be more
conducive to international economic and financial stability,"" she
added.
 To that end, developing countries must speed up reform of
their financial markets, and China would work to promote greater
cross-border use of the yuan, she said.
 DIVERSIFICATION
 There have been signs in recent months that Beijing has
stepped up the pace of diversification of its foreign exchange
reserves away from dollar assets.
 Chinese net buying of Japanese debt has surpassed 1.7
trillion yen this year, far surpassing its record of 255.7
billion yen in 2005. [ID:nTOE67802Z]
 China has also raised holdings of South Korean bonds by 2.48
trillion won ($2.11 billion) in the first seven months of this
year from 1.87 trillion won at the end of last year. However,
Chinese investors only started buying South Korean bonds in the
middle of 2009. [ID:nTOE67I05M]
 At the same time, China has slightly cut back its vast
holdings of U.S. Treasuries, from $894.8 billion at the start of
the year to $843.7 billion in June, according to the most recent
data. China remains the biggest single holder of U.S. government
debt. [ID:nN16255591]
 But analysts have also warned against reading too much into
the apparent shifts in the flow of cash from China. Like any
investor with commercial interests in mind, Beijing has shown a
readiness to shift its strategy depending on what it sees as good
buys at the time.
 The China Securities Journal laid out the prospects for a
shift back to the dollar in the near term.
 ""It is unlikely that China will increase purchases of
Japanese bonds in the coming months because the yen might weaken
at any time,"" the newspaper said.
 ""China is very likely to increase purchases of U.S.
Treasuries in September. The possibility for China to buy more
Korean bonds can't be ruled out,"" it added.

 * Asian stocks up just 0.3 percent
 * Yen near 15-yr high against dollar
 SYDNEY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks squeezed higher on
Friday but gains were tentative ahead of U.S. jobs data that
will be closely watched for signals on whether the world's
biggest economy is headed for a second recession.
 There was no missing the sombre mood ahead of the
employment report at 1230 GMT. Surprisingly strong U.S.
manufacturing data earlier this week had dispelled some gloom
about faltering growth, but investors were far from convinced
all was well.
 The cautious tone spill over into Europe, where the
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares, Britain's FTSE 100,
Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 all edged up 0.2-0.3 percent.
U.S. S&P 500 futures weakened a fraction.
 Yet, some warned the gloom may be overdone.
 ""Market players have been building up positions for some
time to brace for a weak U.S. recovery. Any upside surprise in
the payrolls data could move the market,"" said Daisuke
Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The MSCI Asian stock index outside Japan edged up just 0.3
percent. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, but was still down
more than 13 percent for the year.
 Sony Corp managed to shrug off economic woes by adding 2.4
percent after it said it was expanding a video-on-demand
service in Europe.
 The U.S. labour market is forecast to have shed 100,000
jobs in August as the jobless rate crept higher to 9.6 percent.
 As always, a bad outcome would likely hammer assets deemed
dependent on strong economic growth, such as stocks and
commodities, whilst boosting government bonds.
 Underscoring angst about U.S. growth, traditional
safe-haven currencies clung to recent peaks, while U.S.
Treasury yields edged lower.
 The yen was locked near a 15-year high against the dollar,
while the Swiss franc flew near a record against the euro.
 Commodity prices barely budged. Gold was little changed at
$1,251.25 an ounce and oil was down 0.4 percent at 74.70 a
barrel.
 CAN ASIAN MARKETS HOLD UP?
 Many believe Asian economies can charge ahead even with
tepid U.S. growth, owing to sturdy demand from emerging market
giants China and India.
 Yet, it is less clear Asian stocks can weather a U.S.
slowdown.
 Some argue that despite Asia's stellar growth profile, its
equity markets are still inextricably linked to developed
markets -- institutional investors in the west are still among
the biggest buyers of Asian stocks.
 Mark Matthews from Macquarie in Hong Kong, for instance,
said the correlation between the MSCI Asia ex-Japan stock index
and the MSCI World Index has risen to 0.8 between 2005 and
2010, from 0.63 in the five years up to 2005.
 Price action so far seemed to suggest that holds some
truth. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index has defied the region's
impressive growth and is down 0.7 percent this year. The MSCI
World index is also down, but by a bigger margin at 3.5
percent.
 But other argued that over the longer term, Asia's solid
growth and healthy public finance would increasingly help it to
survive thriftier U.S. and European consumers.
 ""In the short term, I don't think any market is immune to
news flow, not least from the U.S. and its payrolls,"" said Alex
Boggis, a fund manager at Aberdeen, which manages more than
$246 billion in assets.
 ""But longer term, it would do better, and in the medium
term, it would do better.""

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The euro and high-yielding
currencies held firm on Friday after an improvement in U.S.
housing and jobless claims data bolstered investor appetite for
risk ahead of key U.S. jobs data later in the day.
 Still, reflecting simmering worries about a slowdown in the
U.S. and global economies, the yen was locked near a 15-year high
against the dollar and the Swiss franc hovered near a record peak
against the euro.
 The two low-yielding currencies tend to be favoured when
investors want to avoid losses rather than seek higher returns.
 ""Market players have been building up positions for some time
to brace for a weak U.S. recovery. So I guess that any upside
surprise in the payrolls data could move the market,"" said
Daisuke Karakama, market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The euro changed hands at $1.2815, little different on the
day but within sight of this week's high of $1.2856 hit on
Wednesday.
 The next target for the euro was around $1.2873 -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from its August peak
around $1.3334 to its August low near $1.2588. The target after
that would be $1.2923, touched on Aug. 18.
 Pending U.S. home resales rose unexpectedly in July and new
claims for unemployment insurance fell for a second straight
week, which, together with upbeat manufacturing data on
Wednesday, eased the gloom over the economy.
 The euro was also helped by healthy results in Spanish and
French bond auctions on Thursday.
 The dollar/yen stood at 84.35 yen per dollar, up slightly on
the day but not far from the 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit late
last month.
 ""There are said to be some stop-losses and option triggers
around 83.50. So it could get ugly if the dollar/yen hits that
level after the payroll data,"" said Teppei Ino, an analyst at
Mitsubishi-Tokyo UFJ Bank.
 Traders are getting cautious about bidding the yen too much
after Japanese ministers said they could take action -- normally
a code word for intervention -- to stem the yen's strength since
late last week.
 But many traders have doubts over whether Tokyo will step
into the forex market at the moment given the high hurdle of
Tokyo to convincing other G7 members about the need to intervene
at a time when they are calling on China to make the yuan more
flexible to ease global imbalances.
 A sharp drop in dollar/yen, such as 1 to 2 percent or more in
a single day towards the 80 yen level and below, is seen as the
most likely scenario that would prompt Japan to stick its neck
out and buy dollars.
 Thus many traders expect the market to test the willingness
of Japan to intervene, especially if U.S. payrolls data comes in
weaker than expected.
 Economists expect a decline of 100,000 jobs overall and a
rise of 41,000 jobs in August.
 The Swiss franc traded at 1.2987 franc per euro, not far from
a record high of 1.2850 hit earlier this week.
 Against the dollar, the Swiss currency stood at 1.0131 franc
per dollar, near a nine-month peak of 1.0065 marked earlier in
the week.
 The Australian dollar, which boasts the highest yield among
major currencies, traded at $0.9100, after having risen $0.9122
on Thursday, its highest in about three weeks.

 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Stocks and oil rose while U.S.
Treasuries fell on Thursday as U.S. data showed the world's
largest economy did not appear to be falling back into
recession.
 But investors were looking ahead to Friday's August U.S.
employment report for clues on the recovery outlook.
 The euro rose against the dollar, supported by healthy
results at Spanish and French bond auctions and stable global
equities. The dollar slipped against other major currencies as
the upbeat economic data boosted risk appetite.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell as strength on Wall Street
undermined the safe-haven appeal of government debt.
 A string of grim economic figures last month ignited fears
that the U.S. economy could slip back into recession. But
Wednesday's rally capped concerns that some deem overblown.
 ""Money seems to be flowing out of bonds and into the stock
market,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at
Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
 ""Obviously, tomorrow comes the big news with the employment
data. But in the near term, it shows how explosive rallies can
be when we get decent economic data, because the market is
pricing a double-dip recession.""

Exchange, the Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange, about
average for the past month but still way below last year's
daily average of 9.65 billion. Volume is typically light in the
days just ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend.
 The housing and labor markets have long been considered two
of the biggest headwinds for the economic recovery. Friday's
payrolls report is expected to show about 100,000 jobs were
lost in August.
 World stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> hit a two-week high as
optimism from strong U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data
extended into a second day.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares

their recovery, aided by the positive U.S. data.
 The benchmark index, which surged 2.9 percent on Wednesday
following strong manufacturing data from the United States and
China, is still down 2.1 percent from a peak in early August.
 Markets showed little reaction to Thursday's decision by
the European Central Bank to keep interest rates on hold at a

 TORONTO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar turned lower
against the U.S. currency on Thursday, giving up some of the
previous session's strong gains, with market players guarded a
day before a key U.S. employment report.
 Investors will be closely monitoring August's non-farm
payrolls report on Friday for signs of whether the U.S. economy
can forge a stronger recovery after Thursday's data eased fears
of a new recession.
 The monthly jobs report is expected to show a third
straight decline. [ID:nN31235915]
 ""We really did have a tremendous day yesterday and we have
non-farm, which is looming tomorrow, so I think as we await
that, there is a holding pattern going on in some currencies,""
said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia
Capital.
 ""Canada has just given up some of yesterday's gains.""
 The Canadian dollar  closed at C$1.0535 to the U.S.
dollar, or 94.92 U.S. cents, down from C$1.0520 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.06 U.S. cents, at Wednesday's close.
 It jumped more than a penny on Wednesday as risk appetite
rose on stronger than expected Chinese and U.S. economic data,
which soothed investor fears about the lagging recovery.
 Thursday's U.S. data showed pending sales of previously
owned U.S. homes rebounded unexpectedly in July and new claims
for jobless benefits fell last week. 
 But the Canadian dollar turned lower even as riskier assets
such as North American stock markets held firm, while
influential oil prices were also up on the day.
 A Reuters poll on Thursday found global currency
strategists expect the Canadian dollar will be little changed
against the greenback over the next few months, and gain
slightly after that. They said the chances of it returning to
parity with the U.S. dollar have diminished. [CAD/POLL]
 BONDS HOLD LOWER
 Domestic bonds were weaker across the curve as double-dip
fears receded on the positive economic data.
 But the big test is still Friday's U.S. jobs report, which
could firm up the market's expectations of the Bank of Canada's
next interest rate move, given that the central bank has said
it is monitoring developments in the United States.
 The sputtering U.S. economy has displaced European debt
problems as the top worry for Canadian policymakers, but even
as gloom settles over the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of
Canada looks set to raise rates for a third time this year.
[ID:nN01259189]
 The bank's Sept. 8 rate decision is one of the closest
calls in some time. Markets are pricing in an almost even
probability of a hike based on yields on overnight index swaps,
according to a Reuters calculation. 
 Another Reuters poll on Thursday showed most primary
dealers and global forecasters expect the Bank of Canada to
boost interest rates next week but then step to the sidelines
for at least the rest of the year. [CA/POLL]
 Canada's two-year bond  dipped 4 Canadian cents
to yield 1.28 percent, while the 10-year issue 
dropped 15 Canadian cents to yield 2.864 percent.

Johanna Sigurdardottir reshuffled her government on Thursday,
saying she aimed to build further on the economy's stabilisation
after the small island's meltdown in 2008.
 Iceland's top three banks collapsed nearly two years ago in
the global credit crunch after years of debt-fuelled growth. The
government had to call in the International Monetary Fund and
eventually agreed a multi-billion dollar bailout.
 Sigurdardottir's Social Democrats and the Left-Greens swept
to power in the wake of the meltdown.
 ""It is to a great extent a financial matter. We need to save
wherever we can, but I also think that public administration
becomes much more effective this way (merging the ministries),""
she told reporters, explaining her reshuffle.
 In a statement, the government said the cabinet had been
reshuffled and the number of ministers cut to 10 from 12.
 The reorganisation means that four ministers, two of whom
have no party affiliation, are leaving the cabinet and two new
ones are coming in. Non-party political Business Affairs
Minister Gylfi Magnusson will be replaced by Arni Arnason, a
Social Democrat.
 The statement said the coalition had managed to guide the
country back to economic sustainability and set out goals for
the reshuffled cabinet for the next 20 months.
 These included completing the third and fourth reviews of
the IMF loan programme and completing the whole programme in the
middle of next year.
 The document said the government would also review whether
new loans were needed and take the next steps in ending capital
controls, which were introduced to stop foreign funds fleeing
the island and to prevent a crash in the crown currency.
 The government made no mention of the Icesave dispute with
Britain and the Netherlands.
 The British and Dutch want Reykjavik to return $5 billion of
money paid to depositors whose funds were frozen in so-called
Icesave accounts operated by Landsbanki, which also collapsed.

 * Lawmakers to change laws in hopes of joining WTO
 * Efforts to improve economy threatened by security risks
 
 By Mohammed Ghobari
 SANAA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Lawmakers drafted a bill to start
a securities exchange authority in Yemen, hoping to speed up the
opening of a bourse and encourage investment despite its sinking
economy and severe security risks such as a resurgent al Qaeda.
 ""For us to move out of the challenges we face, we need a lot
of investment in the development of Yemen, whether it's domestic
or foreign...a strong stock market would help that,"" Jalal
Yaqoub, a spokesman for the minister of finance, told Reuters.
 There is little chance seen of significant investment in
Yemen in the near future, apart from its oil industry.
[nLDE67S087]
 The government hopes that establishing a bourse authority
will create a better economic environment, but it will likely be
considered a small achievement in the face of Yemen's
instability, poor infrastructure, and corruption.
 Impoverished Yemen faces an increasingly violent struggle
with southern secessionists just as it is endeavouring to cement
a truce with northern rebels after a six-year war that has
displaced 350,000 people.
 The government is also trying to quash a resurgent al Qaeda
wing in Yemen that sparked Western and Saudi security concerns
when it claimed a failed December bombing of a U.S.-bound plane.
 In recent months the militant group has increased strikes on
Yemen's security personnel, claiming responsibility for several
bloody clashes that have killed dozens of people.
 But many analysts say the biggest existential threat to the
government is its economy, with nearly a third of the workforce
jobless and more than 40 percent of the country's 23 million
people surviving on under $2 dollars a day.
 Corruption also pervades life in Yemen. The country lies
near the bottom of Transparency International's corruption
index, ranking 154 out of 180 countries last year.
 Yaqoub says the bill which parliament has drafted to
establish a securities exchange authority would ensure the
bourse's transparency and protect investor money.
 The bill now needs final approval from the president.
 Yaqoub rejected the idea that there would be little interest
in a Yemeni exchange, citing internal investment.
 ""There are considerable funds in the domestic market but it
needs to be channelled properly,"" he said.
 Lawmakers hope that by establishing an authority, the
process of opening the bourse will be sped up. But Yaqoub would
not give a specific date for starting the authority or the stock
market, saying it would happen ""sooner rather than later"".
 Separately, Minister of Trade and Industry Yahya
al-Mutawakil said the government planned to change several laws
in order to comply with World Trade Organisation regulations,
according to the defence ministry newspaper September 26.
 Yemen will hold negotiations with the international trade
regulator in Geneva later this month, Mutawakil said.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday,
supported by healthy results at Spanish and French bond
auctions and stable global equities but investors remained
cautious ahead of a key reading on the U.S. labor market on
Friday.
 The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged at
1 percent as expected and extended its liquidity safety-net on
worries about vulnerable banks. The decision and following
remarks by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet were seen as
positive but had limited impact on the euro.
 The focus now is on the Labor Department's monthly
employment report, with analysts predicting U.S. nonfarm
payrolls fell a third straight month in August.
 Currency markets are not paying too much attention ""to
anything but the jobs number tomorrow,"" said Greg Salvaggio,
vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 A scarcity of jobs threatens to derail a fragile recovery
and a weak employment report would be further confirmation of
deterioration in the economy, which could cause investors to
favor government bonds, pushing benchmark yields even lower.
 Low yields have contributed to weakness in the greenback
recently, with many investors selling dollars in favor of other
safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and the yen in
reaction to negative U.S. news.
 ""The key jobs figures tomorrow could set the market's tone
for the weeks ahead,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc in Washington.
 ""Another disappointing employment report ... would likely
play up concerns about America's recovery losing momentum and
see the dollar fall further in the data's initial aftermath,""
he said.
 In late morning trading in New York, the euro was up 0.1
percent at $1.2822, gaining support after Spain and France drew
decent demand as they sold a combined 12.2 billion euros in
bonds.
 The next target for the euro was around $1.2873 -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from its August peak
of $1.3334 to its August low of $1.2588. The target after that
would be $1.2923, touched on Aug. 18.
 Earlier data confirmed the euro zone economy grew by 1.0
percent quarter-on-quarter between April and June.
 In the United States reports were also supportive, with an
unexpectedly strong reading on pending home sales and a drop in
weekly jobless claims.
 Upbeat U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data on Wednesday had
lured investors away from perceived safe-haven assets, lifting
stocks, commodities and higher-yielding currencies.
 ""With so much uncertainty, the market is very volatile and
moves depend on the daily data flow,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 84.17 yen, close to a
15-year low of 83.58 yen hit last week. The yen showed limited
reaction to Japan's political heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa saying
action was needed to stem yen gains.
 SWEDISH CROWN GAINS
 The Swedish crown rose to its highest in more than two
years against the euro earlier around 9.2959 after Sweden's
central bank raised its key interest rate to 0.75 percent, as
expected.
 It also left its forecasts for interest rates unchanged
from July, helping to lift the crown as many in the market had
expected them to lower the profile slightly. The Riksbank was
also upbeat on the economy.

 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Stocks rose and U.S.
Treasuries fell on Thursday as U.S. data showed strength in the
economy, but investors were mainly focused on Friday's closely
followed U.S. unemployment report for economic clues.
 Oil prices eased as a drop in weekly U.S. jobless claims,
an unexpected rise in pending home sales in July and slightly
stronger factory orders failed to soothe concerns about
economic weakness in the world's largest energy consumer.
 The euro was flat against the dollar after comments from
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and the
decision by the bank's Governing Council to keep interest rates
at a record low of 1 percent. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6810DM].
 U.S. Treasury debt prices eased as some strength on Wall
Street undermined the safe-haven appeal of government debt.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 1.67 points,
or 0.02 percent, at 10,271.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 3.53 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,083.82. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 8.83 points, or 0.41
percent, at 2,185.67.
 ""The market was braced for a diaster after what we saw with
existing sales, so this is positive, while the factory orders
looked a little light compared with expectations,"" said John
Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.
 ""People are reluctant to do much of anything today except
position themselves for tomorrow and digest yesterday's
gains.""
 World stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> hit a two-week high earlier as
optimism from strong U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data
extended into a second day.
 ""I would expect that we are going to have a pretty quiet
day today. I would say if we are able to hold even through the
day and hold on to (Wednesday's) gains that is a good sign,""
said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook
Investments LLC, in Lisle, Illinois.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
was slightly lower after surging 2.9 percent on Wednesday,
their biggest gain since May, on upbeat manufacturing data from
China and the United States.
 The market showed little reaction to Thursday's decision by
the European Central Bank to keep interest rates on hold at a
record low, as expected, amid tepid economic recovery and
persistent concerns about the banking sector. [ID:nLDE68114V]
 The euro  was up 0.02 percent at $1.2814 from a
previous session close of $1.2811 supported by healthy results
at Spanish and French bond auctions and stable global
equities.
 France and Spain sold 12.2 billion euros of bonds, with the
average yield on the 5-year Bono dropping at auction and the
paper easily absorbed as the yield fell after the tender.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.14
percent at 84.30 from a previous session close of 84.420.
 The focus now is on the Labor Department's widely watched
monthly employment report, with analysts predicting U.S.
non-farm payrolls probably fell for a third straight month in
August. [ID:nN31235915]
 Currency markets are not paying too much attention ""to

vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices extended early losses after the
release of July factory orders and pending home sales data.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 13/32, with the yield at 2.6249 percent. The 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond  was down 36/32, with the yield at
3.7107 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  fell 51 cents, or 0.69 percent, to
$73.40 per barrel on concerns about a slowing economic recovery
and high oil inventories, while spot gold prices  rose
$3.75, or 0.30 percent, to $1,247.60.

 By Sakari Suoninen
 FRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
extended its liquidity safety net for vulnerable euro zone banks
into next year, delaying its exit from crisis measures as it
urged caution about economic recovery.
 The ECB also left rates at a record low of 1 percent for the
16th month in a row on Thursday and said policy remained
accommodative as the region battles with an uneven recovery and
concerns about bank vulnerability.
 Although ECB staff raised growth forecasts, President
Jean-Claude Trichet said risks were to the downside and the
recovery would be moderate with uncertainty prevailing.
 ""We have to remain cautious and prudent. We don't declare
victory,"" he told his monthly news conference, although he said
a double-dip recession was not on the cards.
 The ECB extended its promise to lend banks unlimited
one-week and one-month funds until at least Jan. 18, keeping
liquidity supplies flush through the tense end-of-year period in
a move which should keep market rates low.
 It will also offer unlimited funds at three-month operations
until December, although the cost of these will not be a flat
fixed rate but indexed to the ECB's policy rate.
 Trichet denied the decision was a signal of an imminent
change to benchmark credit costs.
 ""I'm absolutely clear the Governing Council has no intention
to signal any change in the present interest rates,"" he said.
Analysts expect no change to rates before Q4 2011.
 
 PERIPHERAL HELP
 While the decision on rates was unanimous, Trichet said the
decision on liquidity supplies was by consensus -- usually a
sign of some dissent on the 22-member Governing Council.
 The extension maintains the lifeline relied on by banks in
countries like Spain, Ireland and Greece, although Trichet
brushed off questions about uneven performance between core
countries such as Germany and those on the rim.
 Borrowing from the ECB by banks in these countries has hit
record highs in recent months even though total lending has
fallen about a third since July, highlighting the difficulties
still faced by some institutions.
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Ireland's credit rating
last week to AA- on the back of an upward revision to the
country's banking crisis bill.
 The 10-year Irish/German government bond yield spread has
hit record highs and spreads on other peripheral government
bonds have also jumped over the last month.
 Analysts said the ECB's move might reduce demand at the
pre-Christmas three-month operation, when it will also offer
extra funds to pad the repayment of the last of 2009's 12-month
cash injections.
 ""It seems they want to cap the attractiveness of a huge
operation at the end of the year and then having it expire in
the first quarter,"" Citi economist Juergen Michels said.
 
 GROWTH UPGRADE
 Germany grew at its fastest rate since reunification in the
second quarter and more than twice as fast as the euro zone
average, confirmed at 1.0 percent on Thursday. 
 But Greece is still in recession and Portugal and Spain
managed just a tenth of Germany's growth rate.
 ""Recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger
than expected, partly owing to temporary factors,"" Trichet said.
""Looking ahead, the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace
with uncertainty still prevailing.""
 Nonetheless, ECB staff upgraded growth forecasts for both
2010 and 2011.
 Growth is now forecast in a range of 1.4 to 1.8 percent this
year -- giving a midpoint of 1.6 percent -- from the 0.7 to 1.3
percent seen in June.
 Next year, growth is expected to be between 0.5 and 2.3
percent, from 0.2-2.2 percent in June.
 The ECB's quarterly forecasts also showed inflation under
control this year and next, with consumer price gains expected
to be 1.5-1.7 percent in 2010 and 1.2-2.2 percent in 2011 --
essentially below the bank's two percent ceiling.
 Euro zone inflation moderated to 1.6 percent last month but
there are some signs of pressure, notably Germany's powerful
steelworkers union demanding a 6 percent pay rise.
 Expectations of continued ECB liquidity largesse have pushed
market interest rates down from 12-month highs over the last
month, although pressure points remain.
 But turnover in overnight money markets fell back in August
and many banks still prefer to deposit excess funds back at the
ECB rather than lending them on to counterparts.
 Banks also face a liquidity cliff at the end of September
when they must repay a total of 225 billion euros in 12-, six-
and three-month funds or roll it into shorter maturities. 
 The ECB is not alone in dragging its feet towards the exit.
Sweden's Riksbank hiked rates on Thursday to 0.75 percent but
cited weak growth in the euro zone and United States as a risk
to the outlook. The Bank of Japan has boosted its cheap loan
scheme and the Federal Reserve took steps towards further
stimulus by reinvesting maturing mortgage-related securities.

KBA
 * September marks one year since govt subsidies ran out

(Adds KBA official statistics, VDA statements, analyst)
 By Christiaan Hetzner
 FRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - German new car registrations
in August were 27 percent lower than a year ago when buyers
enjoyed the last of the government's car scrappage incentives,
according to official data published on Thursday.
 Germany's motor vehicle department KBA said in a statement
that roughly 20,885 new cars were registered with the
authorities last month -- a drop of 27 percent versus the year
earlier when the government was still subsidising their purchase
via a fleet renewal programme.
 Even when compared with two years ago, demand still
contracted. In the eight months through August, registrations
fell 9.6 percent to 1.9 million vehicles via the comparison
period from 2008, when the market was not distorted by the
scrappage scheme often referred to as ""Cash for Clunkers"".
 This time last year, the agency responsible for managing the
programme said that all 5 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in the
pot of government money had been exhausted, harkening the end of
a consumption craze that inflated the market to 3.81 million
vehicles -- a level last seen in 1992.
 Auto industry analyst Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer believes the
division has remained between the market for small cars bought
by retail customers, which were the sole winner of the Cash for
Clunkers programme, and corporate cars that tend to be larger
and dominated by premium brands.
 ""Incentives for the overall market may have declined last
month but for the small car segment alone they have risen to a
level never seen before, if you strip out the 2,500 euros from
the government's scrapping scheme last year,"" he said.
 ""This will likely subside once private demand recovers
starting around March 2011.""
 On Wednesday, car sales figures for the key U.S. market
showed the weakest August since 1983 while sales in rival market
of China grew a whopping 59 percent -- underlining the change in
roles of the two biggest economies in the world.
 Vehicle sales also declined in western Europe as government
incentives ended in some countries.

 
 EXPORTS SLOW
 Thanks to booming exports, industry employment in Germany
has been able to withstand the stomach-churning plunge in car
sales to what will almost certainly be an historic low for the
country since its reunification.
 ""German auto makers drove out of the valley of the crisis
faster than many expected. Our robust position in global markets
has proven once again to be a strategic advantage,"" the head of
the German automotive industry association VDA, Matthias
Wissmann, said on Thursday.
 Export growth has slowed however as demand from abroad
normalises, according to data from the VDA.
 Foreign new vehicle orders rose 12 percent in August, while
year to date they have still increased by 25 percent, pointing
to a flattening out in growth.
 Altogether, production gained 4 percent last month to
338,500 vehicles.
 Germany's VDIK also said that registrations of new
commercial vehicles rose 19 percent to 21,000 units, helped by a
rebound in the general economy.

 * Paris echoes Chicago gains
 * Soy ticks up; corn softens after near 2 percent jump
 
 (Adds Russia, updates prices)
 By Martin Roberts
 MADRID, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures gained more
than 1 percent on top of a demand-led rally of more than 3
percent in the previous session, while global supply appeared to
be tightening as Russia said it would extend its export ban.
 Corn eased after climbing to a 14-1/2 month top on
Wednesday, while soybeans, which have been subdued by early U.S.
harvest, ticked higher.
 ""The supply side story is pretty much in the market at the
moment, and any upside action has to be on back of the demand
story which we had last night,"" said Brett Cooper, a senior
manager of markets at brokerage FCStone Australia.
 Chicago Board of Trade September wheat was up 7-1/4 cents at
$6.82-3/4 a bushel by 1309 GMT and the more actively traded
December contract rose 0.92 percent to $7.13-1/2 a bushel.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Russia could consider
lifting its grain export ban only after next year's harvest has
been collected.
 Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was optimistic
over his country's wheat stocks, although traders doubted this
would halt Russian imports. 
 ""After the export ban the Russians probably have enough
stocks for their immediate use, but more people are expecting
imports in the coming months,"" a German trader said.
 Medvedev meanwhile ordered Russian law enforcement agencies
to prevent speculators from driving up food prices after the
worst harvest in years and pledged help to ensure affordable
food staples.
 Analysts said the trigger on Wednesday was the news that
Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, bought 225,000 tonnes
of U.S. wheat and that Germany purchased 20,000 tonnes of U.S.
spring wheat, the first such purchase in three years.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday confirmed
that exporters shipped 83,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat to Egypt in
the week ended Aug. 26.
 ""The shortage of wheat in some traditional exporting
countries - Russia will probably also be dependent on wheat
imports - should lead to a further reduction in high U.S. wheat
stocks and therefore support prices,"" Commerzbank said in a
note.
 Gains in Chicago meanwhile drove gains in France, Europe's
biggest wheat producer, as did intense export activity.
 Paris traders were waiting to see if benchmark prices could
break through firm resistance at 230 euros/tonne, which could
accelerate the rally. 
 November milling wheat on Euronext was up 2 euros at 229.50
euros a tonne by 1312 GMT.
 ""There is a good chance we'll go above 230 euros today. Some
operators see the market at 250 euros,"" one futures broker said.
""There is so much export demand that buyers are paying above
market prices.""
 Wheat futures have surged since July as drought in the Black
Sea region, too much rain in Canada and a mix of unfavourable
weather in European Union countries have forced downgrades of
2010 wheat crop forecasts.
 There was more bullish news from Argentina, where 2010/11
wheat output is seen between 9 million and 10.5 million tonnes,
the Rosario grains exchange said, putting its first harvest
estimate far below other forecasts.
 Western Australia has had rain this week, bringing some
relief to parched crops in the nation's top wheat exporting
state.
 The corn market, which has been aided by the strengthening
wheat market and lower-than-expected yields, was slightly
weaker. CBOT September corn slipped 0.29 percent to $4.28-3/4
per bushel and the December contract slid by 0.17 percent to
$4.45 per bushel.
 FCStone cut its estimate of the U.S. 2010 corn crop to
13.195 billion bushels, with an average yield of 162.9 bushels
per acre (bpa).
 It projected the 2010 U.S. soybean crop at 3.390 billion
bushels, down from 3.428 billion in the August estimate. The
firm lowered its soybean yield estimate to 43.5 bushels per acre
from 44.0 last month.
 The forecasts compared with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's current corn production forecast of 13.365 billion
bushels, with an average yield of 165.0 bpa.
 CBOT new-crop November soybeans rose 0.2 percent to $10.07 a
bushel.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2010 09:20AM ET</span>",POLL-Yen to gradually weaken over next 12 months," * Dollar seen below 90 yen for next six months
 * Weakness in the yen seen as overall trend
 
 By Anooja Debnath
 BANGALORE, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen is set to
gradually weaken against the U.S. dollar over the year, although
at a markedly slower pace than was forecast last month even as
the Bank of Japan attempts to tame its stubborn rise.
 Consensus forecasts for the yen in the latest Reuters poll
of more than 60 strategists taken this week were scaled back
considerably from a similar survey a month ago.
 The dollar is expected to end September at 85.0 yen, before
inching to 86.0 yen in three months, 89.5 in six and 95.0 in 12
months.
 These are the strongest yen forecasts since at least January
2008 and some analysts believe the currency is set to touch new
highs in the near term unless the Bank of Japan steps in with
bolder intervention measures.
 ""Price action over the past few days has demonstrated that
BoJ policy has become ineffective in slowing yen appreciation,""
said Kenneth Broux at Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets. 
 ""In the context of a weakening U.S. economy and the clouded
outlook for risk assets, I suspect the yen will stay supported
in the short term.""
 August proved to be a crucial month for the safe-haven
currency, as it soared to levels not seen in 15 years, with a
barrage of gloomy U.S. economic data cutting risk appetite and
quelling any hopes of an immediate recovery.
The yen's rise last month, which threatens to hurt
export-reliant Japan's fragile economic recovery, caught
strategists off guard in last month's survey, with only six of
52 seeing the USD/JPY at levels below 85 by end-August.
 The dollar closed at 84.16 yen on Aug. 31.
 The BoJ decided on Monday to expand its fixed-rate fund
supply scheme to 30 trillion yen from 20 trillion yen, and to
launch a new six-month loan operation in addition to an existing
three-month scheme.
 The move, which did little to curb the yen's rise,
disappointed markets and drove Japan's Nikkei stock index down
16 percent -- making it one of the worst-performing markets in
the world this year next to China and Greece.
 Only three of 63 strategists in the latest poll see the
dollar at below 80 yen over the period forecasted.
 While many hope currency intervention by the Japanese
authorities is on the cards, some believe the BoJ and the
Ministry of Finance will hold fire unless the dollar slips to
the record low of 79.75 seen in April 1995.
 ""People have that view that 85 (yen) was going to be some
kind of line in the sand that would bring forward the Ministry
of Finance to order the Bank of Japan in,"" said Ray Attrill at
4Cast.
 ""But we were never really thinking as high as that and the
Japanese were still fundamentally quite reluctant to go back
down the route of intervention.""
 Calculated cross rates saw the EUR/JPY at 107.6 in one
month, 108.0 in three months, 109.3 in six and 114.5 in 12
months. 
 
 FRANC TO FALTER?
 The Swiss franc is set for a slight reversal in trend and
will weaken against the euro, according to the latest poll.
 The euro is seen ending September at 1.306 francs before
strengthening to 1.319 in six months and 1.350 in 12 months.
 The swiss franc hit an all-time high at 1.2985 against the
euro last month as mounting fears about the euro zone crisis saw
investors scurry to the safety of the swissie, rattling the
Swiss National Bank (SNB) which until June was intervening
directly in currency markets to stem the franc's rise.
 ""No SNB response will ultimately tease investors to test new
all-time (euro) lows: with 1.30 gone and dips below 1.29 already
tested, we think that 1.28-1.27 will be in the cards,"" said
Roberto Mialich at UniCredit.

against the dollar over the coming year but will gain some
ground against a struggling euro, the latest Reuters poll of
foreign exchange strategists shows.
 Median predictions in the poll of more than 60 analysts at
top currency dealers taken this week saw cable at $1.54 in one
month before dipping to $1.53 in six months. It was seen trading
back at $1.54 in a year's time. 
 The forecasts were little changed from last month's poll,
although the pound was seen a little stronger in a year, and in
line with the $1.54 the pound was trading at on Wednesday.
 ""Cable may suffer further in the near term by renewed global
risk aversion and worsening prospects for the UK economy coupled
with fears that the Bank of England may be ultimately forced to
resume quantitative easing,"" said Roberto Mialich at UniCredit.
 ""A partial rebound of the British pound can be pencilled in
only on a much longer horizon,"" he added.
 Sterling fell against the dollar in August to as low as
$1.53 compared with the median expectation of $1.57 as comments
from Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale rekindled concerns
over the risk of a double-dip recession in Britain.
 But the pound is expected to perform better against the euro
in the coming year as the common currency faces its own
struggles.

 The euro was seen worth 82 pence in a month before weakening
to 81p in six months and then to 80p in a year, slightly weaker
than in an August poll.
 ""We look for (sterling) outperformance against the euro,
where lagged data and periphery country risks linger,"" said Meng
Jiao at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 The euro zone economy has escaped from recession and while
it grew 1.0 percent between April and June growth is seen
slowing to 0.4 percent in the current quarter and then to 0.3
percent in the following three quarters.
 Also worrying for policymakers is recent data suggesting a
growing divergence in recovery rates among the 16 member
countries.
 The Bank of England's tactics of slashing interest rates to
near zero and pumping 200 billion pounds into the money supply
to drag the economy out of its worst post-war recession appear
to have paid off.
 The economy grew a surprising 1.2 percent in the second
quarter of this year, its fastest in nine years, but that pace
is seen tapering off to between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent in
coming quarters as tough austerity measures begin to bite.
 ""Harsh austerity measures and a soft BoE will keep GBP
subdued,"" said Kasper Kirkegaard at Danske Bank.
 The British government is planning huge public spending cuts
and a global slowdown is weighing on markets but sterling
volatility against the dollar was seen falling over the coming
month.

 * Holds rates at record low 1 percent, as expected
 * Raises growth forecasts but urges caution on outlook
 
 (Adds TV interview, economist quote, details)
 By Sakari Suoninen and Krista Hughes
 FRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
extended its liquidity safety net for vulnerable euro zone banks
into next year, delaying its exit from crisis measures for now
as it urged caution about the economic recovery.
 The ECB left rates at a record low of 1 percent for the 16th
month in a row on Thursday and said policy remained
accommodative as the region battles with an uneven recovery and
concerns about bank vulnerability.
 ECB staff raised economic growth forecasts but President
Jean-Claude Trichet said risks were to the downside and the
recovery would be moderate with uncertainty prevailing.
 ""We have to remain cautious and prudent. We don't declare
victory,"" he told his monthly news conference, although a
double-dip recession was not on the cards.
 The ECB extended its promise to lend banks unlimited
one-week and one-month funds until at least Jan. 18, keeping
liquidity flush through the tense end-of-year period in a move
which should keep market rates low.
 It will also offer unlimited funds at three-month operations
until December although the cost of these will not be fixed in
advance, rather indexed to the ECB's policy rate.
 Although Trichet said the decision should not be taken as a
signal the ECB was preparing to raise rates, analysts said it
was positioning itself to wind back liquidity support in early
2011 as a precursor to raising policy rates.
 The return of ""accommodative"" to describe policy, a word
which has been absent from the introductory statement for three
years but which became a key communication during the last
tightening cycle in 2006 and 2007, also raised eyebrows.
 ""It's not a finger on the trigger but the safety catch is
off,"" Societe Generale economist James Nixon said. 
 ""I think early next year they are going to progress onto the
next stage of their exit strategy and in the second half, they
will have their finger on the trigger.""
 
 PERIPHERAL HELP
 While the decision on rates was unanimous, Trichet said the
decision on liquidity supplies was by consensus -- usually a
sign of some dissent on the 22-member Governing Council.
 The extension maintains a lifeline for banks in countries
like Spain, Ireland and Greece, although Trichet brushed off
questions about the gap in performance between core countries
such as Germany and those struggling on the euro zone rim.
 Borrowing from the ECB by banks in these countries has hit
record highs in recent months even though total lending has
fallen about a third since July.
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Ireland's credit rating
last week to AA- after the country's banking crisis bill was
revised upwards.
 
 GROWTH UPGRADE
 ECB staff upgraded growth forecasts on the back of a strong
second quarter, when Germany grew at its fastest rate since
reunification and more than twice as fast as the euro zone
average, confirmed at 1.0 percent on Thursday. 
 But Greece is still in recession and Portugal and Spain
managed just a tenth of Germany's growth rate.
 Staff see euro zone growth of about 1.6 percent this year,
from about 1 percent in June, and about 1.4 percent in 2011,
from 1.2 percent.
 The quarterly forecasts also showed inflation under control,
with consumer price gains seen at about 1.6 percent in 2010 and
1.7 percent in 2011 -- below the bank's 2 percent ceiling.
 Euro zone inflation moderated to 1.6 percent last month but
there are some signs of pressure, notably Germany's powerful
steelworkers union demanding a 6 percent pay rise.
 Expectations of continued ECB liquidity largesse have pushed
market interest rates down from 12-month highs over the last
month, although pressure points remain.
 But turnover in overnight money markets fell back in August
and many banks still prefer to deposit excess funds back at the
ECB rather than lend them on to counterparts.
 The ECB also moved on Thursday to ensure banks cope with
liquidity cliffs at the end of September and December, when the
repayment, or roll-over, of hundreds of billions of euros
borrowed in 12-, six- and three-month funds, is due.
 It will offer three special short-term cash injections
towards the end of October, November and December to help banks
at risk of getting caught short of funds.
 The ECB is not alone in dragging its feet towards the exit.
Sweden's Riksbank hiked rates on Thursday to 0.75 percent but
cited weak growth in the euro zone and United States as a risk
to the outlook. The Bank of Japan has boosted its cheap loan
scheme and the Federal Reserve took steps towards further
stimulus by reinvesting maturing mortgage-related securities.

65,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2010 09:08AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Ukraine central bank reshuffle weakens hryvnia," * Top c.banker replaced by newcomer close to Yanukovich
 * Hryvnia weakens after steady revaluation
 * Naftogaz, other importers may have contributed to move
(Adds hryvnia rebounding, comments)
 KIEV, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The replacement of a senior
Ukrainian central banker as part of President Viktor
Yanukovich's power consolidation campaign has rattled investors,
prompting the hryvnia to reverse its steady appreciation.
 The hryvnia posted its biggest fall in six weeks on Thursday
after the central bank's First Deputy Chairman Anatoly
Shapovalov, who was closely involved with exchange rate
decision-making, resigned on Wednesday.
 The hryvnia touched its weakest level since mid-July of
7.905 per dollar on Thursday, according to Reuters data, before
rebounding to 7.89, a level it had maintained throughout August,
supported by strong revenues from metals exports.
 Shapovalov was replaced by Serhiy Arbuzov, a 34-year-old
banker with no prior central bank experience.
 Anastasia Golovach, analyst at Renaissance Capital in Kiev,
also linked the hryvnia's slide to possible buying of dollars by
state energy company Naftogaz on the eve of payments for Russian
gas and the usual autumn pick-up in importers' demand for
foreign currencies.
 A local trader agreed with the Naftogaz version.
 ""There's only one buyer (of dollars) that can move the
market, which is Naftogaz. After its purchases, exporters and
non-residents came up with selling,"" said a chief dealer at a
foreign bank in Kiev.
 He said the central bank ""kept silence"" and did not
intervene on the market.
 ""Looks like no one is ready to make an interventions
decision after shifts in its management"", the dealer said.
 The central bank, which has not announced any interventions
since Monday, could not be reached for comment.
 
 YANUKOVICH ALLY
 Analysts see the reshuffle as part of Yanukovich's drive to
fill key government positions with members of his team.
 ""The replacement of Anatoly Shapovalov by Serhiy Arbuzov ...
highlights once again the gradual concentration of power in the
hands of Yanukovich,"" Citi analyst Luis Costa said in a note on
Thursday.
 ""Arbuzov, formerly the chairman of the board at Ukreximbank,
has been very close to Yanukovich in the past.""
 Yanukovich has been strengthening his grip on power after
winning presidential elections in January, naming a close ally
as prime minister and sidelining the opposition.
 ""It's part of the political changes in Ukraine, just a
continuation of the process by which the new administration is
filling key positions with people aligned with the Regions
Party,"" said UniCredit analyst Dmitry Gurov.
 ""But I don't think it's something that should be feared by
the market; what is important is that there is continuity of
policy and they have an IMF programme that gives direction to
what the government and central bank need to do,"" Gurov said.
 Gurov said he still expected the hryvnia to strengthen to
7.4 per dollar by the end of this year.
 ""There is a tendency for hryvnia appreciation and the central
bank has been intervening to prevent it from rising. But I think
they should stop doing that in October-November as the IMF has
asked them to start liberalising the FX markets,"" he said.
 ""Also there will be a rise in inflation driven by the hikes
in utility prices.""
 Last month Ukraine received the first, $1.9 billion slice of
a $15 billion International Monetary Fund loan programme
negotiated by Yanukovich's government, and a top official has
said a second payment might arrive in December.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2010 09:00AM ET</span>","BUY OR SELL-Time to buy silver, a safe-haven Cinderella"," * Silver offers good short-term buy
 * Investment flows supportive
 * Oversupply, demand issues to cap upside
 
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Renewed uncertainty over the
global economic outlook has revitalised the push into perceived
safe-haven assets like gold, but as bullion edges ever closer to
record highs, silver has emerged as a cheap alternative.
Dubbed ""the poor man's gold,"" silver has risen by nearly 15
percent so far this year to above $19.00 an ounce, making it one
of the top performing commodities of 2010.
 The gold/silver ratio -- the number of ounces of silver
needed to buy an ounce of gold -- has hit its lowest since
mid-May, denoting silver's outperformance relative to gold.
 Silver's main sources of demand are from industrial
applications such as semi-conductors and jewellery.
 This confers it enough of a split personality to benefit
from the risk aversion that boosts gold, and from the risk
appetite that supports industrial commodities like copper.
 However, there is a caveat. Silver is notoriously volatile
and profits in this metal can be as elusive as Cinderella, the
fairytale heroine, at midnight.
 ""It's not for the faint-hearted, it's not for widows and
orphans. You've got to know what you're doing or you can be
stopped out quite easily,"" said Credit Agricole analyst Robin
Bhar. ""In a rising market, it does well, but in a falling
market, everybody rushes for the exit,"" he said.
 The intraday volatility of silver far outstrips that of gold
and is bested only by that of palladium, another small market
that can fall and rise in tsunami-like price bursts.
 A raft of patchy U.S. economic data in August has raised the
threat of a return to recession in the world's largest economy,
and ignited doubt over the ability of the emerging world to
offset such a double-dip.
 
 BUY: AS DEMAND PICKS UP
 This renewed concern has translated into hefty inflows into
exchange-traded products backed by physical metal.
 The iShares Silver Trust, the world's largest
exchange-traded silver fund, has seen net inflows of around 95
tonnes in the last month alone.
 ""Silver ETF supporters have been conspicuously absent this
year relative to the significant ETF creations in the other
precious metals,"" wrote UBS precious metals strategist Edel
Tully in a note last week.
 ""This less-speculative element to silver's rally, and the
relatively sticky nature of ETF investment, suggests that silver
may now have a bit more staying power compared to previous
run-ups this summer,"" she said.
 Consultancy Gold Fields Mineral Services said in May this
year it expected rising investor demand to be a key driver for
the price of silver this year.
 Total open interest in COMEX silver futures has fallen in
2010, but the managed net long silver position, which analysts
use to gauge hedge fund holdings, has more than doubled in the
last six months to some 138.9 million ounces, and the
non-commercial net long -- used to gauge speculative activity --
has risen by some 35 million ounces to 174.1 million ounces.
 RBS analysts Nick Moore and Daniel Major note silver should
get ""reflected glory from a firmer gold price.""
 ""Because silver is more volatile than gold, it is often used
to finesse gold positions ... and so we should be prepared to
see silver attempt to break higher in the coming weeks.""
 
 SELL: NO HOME BIG ENOUGH FOR SURPLUS
 Even if silver's exposure to the growth cycle protects it to
an extent from an evaporation in the need for a safe-haven,
without healthy investment flows, mine supply will cap prices.
 ""The industrial side is more important for silver, but the
marginal demand driver tends to come from investors,"" said Bank
of America-Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Widmer.
 ""Now, when you have investor interest subsiding, the
industrial side will become more important, but at the moment,
looking at the macro picture, I don't see that happening.""
 The offtake lost from the decline of traditional photography
-- silver's main source of demand -- has not been replaced by
evolving new uses such as photovoltaic cells in solar panels.
 The Silver Institute estimates mine output reached 709.6
million ounces last year and above-ground stocks were around
20.2 million ounces. Even the iShares Silver Trust only holds a
fraction of that amount, some 298 million ounces.
 ""The market has been in surplus for many, many years,
above-ground stocks are high... As prices move higher, you're
going to get a lot of forward selling from producers,"" said
Credit Agricole's Bhar.

"
67,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2010 08:56AM ET</span>",(Blank Headline Received)," Looking at M3 components, annual M1 growth moderated further
to 2.9% in February 2011, while the growth of other short-term
deposits and marketable instruments has increased. This
rebalancing within M3 reflects the impact of the recent
steepening of the yield curve on the remuneration of different
monetary assets. However, this steeper yield curve also implies
a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the
attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly
remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3.
 On the counterpart side, a further rise in the annual growth
rate of bank loans to the private sector in February is due in
part to a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to
non-financial corporations, which rose to 0.6% in February,
after 0.5% in January. The growth of loans to households was
3.0% in February, compared with 3.1% in January. Overall, in
early 2011 the positive flow of lending to the non-financial
private sector has become more broadly based across the
household and non-financial corporation sectors.
 The latest data confirm that banks have expanded their
lending to the private sector further, while at the same time
the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly
unchanged. It is important that banks continue to expand the
provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of
increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary,
it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the
market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full
advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation.
In particular, banks that currently have limited access to
market financing urgently need to increase their capital and
their efficiency.
 To sum up, the Governing Council decided to increase the key
ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The adjustment of the
current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted
in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have
identified in our economic analysis. A cross-check with the
signals from our monetary analysis indicates that while the
underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate,
monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the
accommodation of price pressures. 
 All in all, it is essential that the recent price
developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary
pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to
keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored
in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but
close to, 2% over the medium term. 
 Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to
contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same
time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain
low. Thus, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative
and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic
activity and job creation. Recent economic data confirm that the
underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be
positive, with uncertainty remaining elevated. We will continue
to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside
risks to price stability. 
 Turning to fiscal policies, it is essential that all
governments achieve the consolidation targets for 2011 that they
have announced. Moreover, the announcement of fully specified
consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond would help to
convince the general public and market participants that the
corrective policies will be sustained. 
 Strengthened confidence in the sustainability of public
finances is key, as this will reduce interest rate risk premia
and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth.
 At the same time, it is crucial that substantial and
far-reaching structural reforms be urgently implemented in the
euro area to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness
and flexibility. In the case of product markets, policies that
enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be
further pursued to speed up restructuring and to facilitate
advances in productivity. On the labour market, the priority
must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and
to remove labour market rigidities.
 Finally, the Governing Council is of the view that the
package of six legislative proposals on economic governance,
adopted by the European Council at its summit on 24-25 March
2011, goes some way to improving economic and budgetary
surveillance in the euro area. 
 However, in our view, the proposals fall short of the
necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area
which is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of Economic and
Monetary Union. Therefore, the Governing Council, in line with
the ECB's opinion of 17 February 2011 on these proposals, urges
the ECOFIN Council, the European Parliament and the Commission
to agree, in the context of their ""trialogue"", on more stringent
requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer
focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in
competitiveness. All this would help to ensure that the new
framework is effective in the long run.

(Adds possible SECO forecast revision, EU data)
 By Catherine Bosley and Sven Egenter
 ZURICH, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Switzerland's economy powered
ahead in the second quarter as companies cranked up investment
spending, data showed on Thursday, likely to prompt both the
government and the central bank to revise up growth forecasts.
 Gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent from the previous
quarter in real terms, the State Secretariat for Economic
Affairs (SECO) said. Economists had expected 0.8 pct growth.
 An economist at the SECO told Reuters the government's
current forecast of 1.8 percent GDP growth for 2010 was too
conservative and might well be revised up, given the good
showing so far this year. [ID:nWEA6598]
 ""The Swiss economy is red hot... although this is probably
the high point,"" said UBS economist Reto Huenerwadel. ""From here
it's going to become more difficult.""
 The Swiss National Bank, which in June dropped its pledge to
intervene in currency markets to cap excessive gains in the
currency, will review its current forecast of around 2 percent
when it holds its next policy meeting on Sept. 16.
 ""The fundamentals continue to point to a risk of a hike
before the end of this year if conditions in the markets allow,""
BNP Paribas economist Eoin O'Callghan said. ""The hurdle to a
hike remains the franc - which has risen to new record highs.""
 The Swiss franc, which hit a record of 1.2848 per euro on
Aug. 31, rose versus the euro after the GDP data was released.

 The current market consensus is for no rise in borrowing
costs -- currently at an ultra-low 0.25 percent -- until
mid-2011 and SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said in an
interview risks to the economy had increased in recent months.
 
 POSSIBLE COOLING
 Switzerland has weathered the crisis better than many of its
European neighbours thanks to its resilient consumers, though
recent surveys have indicated the recovery could well slow due
to the strong franc and faltering U.S. economy.
 Retail sales, however, kicked the third quarter off to a
strong start, surging 4.8 percent on the year in July.
 ""The Swiss National Bank might raise its growth forecast for
... 2010 but the message will remain the same: good growth for
the whole year but a slightly weaker second half,"" Sarasin
economist Alessandro Bee said.
 The GDP data showed that consumer spending was flat on the
quarter and goods exports nudged up only 0.1 percent.
[ID:nZAT010980]
 SECO-economist Bruno Parnisari told Reuters the strong
currency may hit exports in the next 2-3 quarters but that so
far no effect had been felt.
 Similarly to Switzerland, where company investments were a
big driver of growth, higher household spending and investment
propelled GDP in the euro zone, Switzerland's largest trading
partner, up 1 percent in the second quarter, with a large part
of that rise due to strong momentum in Germany. [ID:nLDE6810XR]

military transporter, the A400M, is not threatened by the latest
delay in talks to ratify a seven-nation deal to bail out the
project, France's defence ministry said on Thursday.
 Defence Minister Herve Morin said on Wednesday Britain and
Germany wanted two to three more months to review capacity needs
before finalising an amended contract for the Airbus transport
plane, which is Europe's largest defence project.
 Asked about the talks at a weekly briefing, defence ministry
spokesman Laurent Teissiere said buyer nations were considering
ways of pooling use of the transport plane as they seek to cut
defence costs but this would not scupper the pact reached in
March.
 ""As part of discussions between France and Britain and
Germany on the best way to share out costs, one thing we are
looking at it is shared use of the A400M. But we are not in a
situation which would put the A400M project in danger.""
 The A400M, which European powers had hoped to use in
Afghanistan from 2009, is designed to transport soldiers and
heavy equipment to combat zones.
 Technical problems in developing the West's largest
turboprop engines helped push the 20 billion euros ($25.6
billion) project years behind schedule and billions of euros
over budget.
 Buyers agreed in March to pump 3.5 billion euros into the
project. The deal allows for up to 10 of the 180 planes on order

 LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Thursday
after healthy results at Spanish and French bond auctions but
investors cautiously awaited comments from European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet.
 The ECB earlier left interest rates unchanged, as expected,
at 1.0 percent. The decision had little impact on the euro.
[ID:nFRK015200] Trichet was due to hold a news conference at
1230 GMT.
 Market players were waiting to see whether the central bank
extends lending support for banks, despite raising its growth
forecasts, and will be watching to see how cautious Trichet is
on the economic outlook. [ID:nLDE6420RY]
 ""Markets are a little cautious. If Trichet does sound
concerned about the outlook then that would be negative for the
euro,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.
 Earlier data confirmed the euro zone economy grew by 1.0
percent quarter-on-quarter between April and June.
[ID:nBRL2KE64X]
 Christensen said currency markets would also take their cue
from developments on equity markets, while U.S. weekly jobless
claims at 1230 GMT would be watched for signals on U.S. labour
market health before payrolls data on Friday. 
 At 1147 GMT, the euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.2823 ,
gaining support after Spain and France drew decent demand as
they sold a combined 12.2 billion euros in bonds.
[ID:nLDE6810D5]
 The next target for the euro was around $1.2873 -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from its August peak
of $1.3334 to its August low of $1.2588. The target after that
would be $1.2923, touched on Aug. 18.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against six major currencies, fell 0.2 percent at 82.372 <.DXY>
after falling 0.8 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day fall
in six weeks. Support was seen at the Aug. 18 low of 81.912. 
 Upbeat U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data on Wednesday
lured investors away from perceived safe-haven assets, lifting
stocks, commodities and higher-yielding currencies. 
 ""With so much uncertainty, the market is very volatile and
moves depend on the daily data flow,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 
 SWEDISH CROWN GAINS
 The Swedish crown rose to its highest in more than two years
against the euro around 9.2955  after Sweden's
central bank raised its key interest rate to 0.75 percent, as
expected. [ID:nSAT008761]
 It also left its forecasts for future interest rates
unchanged from July, helping to lift the crown as many in the
market had expected them to lower the profile slightly. The
Riksbank was also upbeat on the economy. See [ID:nLDE6810FC]
 However, traders and analysts said investors took profit on
the crown below 9.300 crowns per euro, which provided
psychological support. By 1147 GMT, the euro had recovered to
9.3165 crowns, though it was still 0.2 percent lower on the day.
 ""It was a surprise that the Riksbank kept their profile for
rate hikes, but investors were quick to take profit below 9.3,""

 By Krista Hughes
 FRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank held
interest rates at a record low on Thursday and is expected to
keep its liquidity safety-net for banks in place as well amid a
lopsided recovery and worries about vulnerable banks.
 All 78 economists in a Reuters poll predicted the ECB would
leave rates at 1 percent for the 16th month in a row and the
median expectation is for no change until the fourth quarter of
2011.
 Analysts also expect the ECB's 22-member Governing Council
to keep lending banks unlimited funds until early next year,
maintaining the lifeline relied on by banks in countries like
Spain, Ireland and Greece.
 Borrowing from the ECB by banks in these countries has hit
record highs in recent months even though total lending has
fallen about a third since July, highlighting the difficulties
still faced by some institutions.
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Ireland's credit rating
last week to AA- on the back of an upward revision to the
country's banking crisis bill.
 The 10-year Irish/German government bond yield spread has
hit record highs and spreads on other peripheral government
bonds have also jumped over the last month amid growing evidence
of a split between core euro countries and those on the
periphery.
 Germany grew at its fastest rate since reunification in the
second quarter and more than twice as fast as the euro zone
average, confirmed at 1.0 percent on Thursday. Greece is still
in recession and Portugal and Spain managed just a tenth of
Germany's growth rate.
 Analysts said the fragile situation in markets and the
uneven recovery meant the ECB, like other central banks, would
have to tread carefully in pulling back support measures.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet will announce the decision
on liquidity supply at his 1230 GMT news conference but most see
an extension as a done deal given even German arch-hawk Axel
Weber said it would be wise to keep borrowing uncapped.
 ""We expect that at this stage the ECB will choose the path
of containing systemic risk in the banking system by providing
unlimited cheap leverage beyond the year-end rather than by
looking to lift the value of bank assets through direct market
interventions,"" Tullett Prebon economist Lena Komileva said.
 
 GROWTH UPGRADE
 ECB staff are expected to upgrade growth forecasts on
Thursday but analysts said this reflected the strong German
showing in Q2 and was no all-clear for the future.
 ""The hopes the ECB may have had that the (bank) stress tests
would restore confidence are now evaporating,"" RBS economist
Jacques Cailloux said. 
 ""The renewed weakness that we are getting in key export
markets is probably feeding into concerns that we are facing
weakness on the economic front.""
 Most economists in the Reuters poll expect growth for 2010
to be revised up from June's mid-point of 1 percent but for the
outlook for 2011 to remain around 1.2 percent. 
 Inflation is seen below the ECB's 2 percent ceiling, with
most economists expecting staff forecasts to remain around 1.5
percent for 2010 and 1.6 percent for 2011. 
 Euro zone inflation moderated to 1.6 percent last month from
1.7 percent in July according to Eurostat's preliminary reading.
 Still, there are some signs of pressure, notably Germany's
powerful steelworkers union demanding a 6 percent pay rise.
 
 NOT ALONE
 Expectations of continued ECB liquidity largesse have pushed
market interest rates down from 12-month highs over the last
month, although pressure points remain.
 Turnover in overnight money markets fell back in August
after doubling in July to more than 1 trillion euros and many
banks still prefer to deposit excess funds back at the ECB
rather than lending them on to counterparts.
 Banks also face a liquidity cliff at the end of September
when they must repay a total of 225 billion euros in 12-, six-
and three-month funds or roll it into shorter maturities. 
 The ECB is not alone in dragging its feet towards the exit.
Although Sweden's Riksbank hiked rates on Thursday to 0.75
percent, it cited weak growth in the euro zone and United States
as a risk to the outlook. The Bank of Japan has boosted its
cheap loan scheme and the U.S. Federal Reserve took steps
towards further stimulus by reinvesting maturing
mortgage-related securities.

 * Union decision expected next week

(Updates with comments from union officials)
 By Jon Herskovitz and Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Striking South African
state workers staged a protest march on Thursday after rejecting
a revised wage offer aimed at ending their three-week strike
that has the government and the labour movement at loggerheads.
 The majority of unions, most of which are in the largest
labour federation COSATU, voted against the offer on Wednesday,
prolonging a strike by 1.3 million state workers that a
prominent economist said was costing about $150 million a day.
[ID:nLDE6800TW
 The strike has shut schools, led to bodies piling up in
state morgues and thrown cold water on the national euphoria
over hosting the June-July football World Cup. It also has
dampened investor sentiment for Africa's biggest economy.
 The government has said it cannot afford the offer it has on
the table, let alone anything higher, and will have to make cuts
elsewhere to meet it.
 ""There are behind-the-scenes political discussions going on.
I cannot give more details but leaders will continue to work for
a solution,"" COSATU Secretary General Zwelinzima Vavi told
Reuters.
 A formal bargaining session between labour and government
officials planned for Thursday will now likely to take place on
Monday as unions seek more time to persuade their rank-and-file
members to reconsider the offer, officials said.
 ""We expect to hear from unions after they consult members.
It's unlikely that they will be done today,"" Dumisani Nkwamba,
spokesman for the public service ministry, told Reuters.
 Hundreds of striking state workers dressed in red T-shirts,
sang and shouted in a protest march through the streets of
Johannesburg, calling on government to meet their demands.
 The government, which offered workers a 7.5 percent pay
raise and 800 rand ($110) a month for housing, has said it will
be forced to make budget cuts and seek funds to pay for it.
 The housing allowance total is twice as much as the
government spends on environmental protection and nearly double
the cost of a new plan to expand antiretroviral therapy in the
country with one of the world's highest infection rates of
HIV/AIDS.
 The unions, whose state sector members include prison
guards, teachers, nurses and immigration officers, have been
demanding a rise of 8.6 percent, well above the 3.7 percent
inflation rate, and 1,000 rand for housing.
 ""Simply put, there is no money available. The resources to
cover the draft agreement proposal will have to come from
reducing expenditure in other areas in the budget,"" government
spokesman Themba Maseko said.
 Union leaders said they would continue to consult their
members, and labour sources said they felt the offer had not
been properly explained to the rank and file, indicating they
were trying to reverse the vote and seek approval for the deal.
 ""People have rejected purely on the figures. They don't
fully understand that the agreement has some positive aspects.
We will try to explain this during the consultations,"" a union
official who did not want to be named told Reuters.
 A threatened sympathy strike by all the nearly 2 million
members of COSATU-affiliated unions temporarily was put on hold
on Wednesday, easing concerns about a walkout that could hurt
mining and manufacturing in Africa's largest economy.
 Suspending the sympathy strike, which could have shut the
mining sector that is responsible for about 5 to 6 percent of
GDP, removes some of the pressure on President Jacob Zuma's
ruling African National Congress to reach a deal fast.
 A separate labour dispute by 70,000 workers seeking 20
percent wage increases in petrol stations, garages and auto
dealerships entered its second day with a protest march planned
for Saturday in Durban, the NUMSA union said.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Thursday on
healthy results at Spanish and French bond auctions but
investors' appetite for risk was tempered ahead of a European
Central Bank policy meeting later in the day and U.S. jobs data
Friday.
 The euro hit a session high of $1.2837 after the results,
recovering from a session low of $1.2777 hit in early European
trading. By 0935 GMT, it was up 0.1 percent at $1.2826.
 ""A few people were sitting long euro on anticipation of good
auctions,"" one London-based trader said.
 Market players were wary of chasing prices aggressively
ahead of the ECB meeting, where they expect the central bank to
keep its benchmark refinancing rate at 1.0 percent and extend
lending support for banks despite raising its economic growth
forecasts.
 If those assumptions prove right, ""the euro can probably
edge up to $1.2850 and perhaps even $1.2900/2920,"" said Chris
Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.
 Traders will be watching to see whether ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet, who is due to hold a news conference at
1230 GMT, makes a formal decision to extend liquidity to help
the banking system and whether he reiterates a cautious stance
on the economic outlook after robust second-quarter figures.
Revised second-quarter euro zone growth data was unchanged at
1.0 percent.
 The next target for the euro was around $1.2873 -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from its August peak
of $1.3334 to its August low of $1.2588. The target after that
would be $1.2923, touched on Aug. 18.
 The Swedish crown rose to its highest in more than two years
against the euro around 9.2955 after Sweden's central bank as
expected raised its key interest rate to 0.75 percent. 
 
 VOLATILE
 The dollar slipped against the yen, and was down 0.4 percent
to 84.08 yen, moving towards a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit last
week.
 The yen showed limited reaction to Japanese political
heavyweight Ichiro Ozawa saying action was needed to stem rapid
rises in the yen. Ozawa is pitted against Prime Minister Naoto
Kan in a party leadership race that could lead to him taking
over the premiership.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.2 percent at
82.351 after falling 0.8 percent on Wednesday, its biggest
one-day fall in six weeks. Support was seen at the Aug. 18 low
of 81.912.
 Upbeat U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data on Wednesday had
lured investors away from perceived safe-haven assets, lifting
stocks, commodities and higher-yielding currencies.
 ""With so much uncertainty, the market is very volatile and
moves depend on the daily data flow,"" said Lee Hardman, currency
economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. ""In the longer term,
the outlook still is unfavourable for risk assets with the U.S.
economy in a soft patch.""
 Data on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers unexpectedly
cut jobs in August, boding ill for the closely watched non-farm
payrolls report on Friday, which is expected to show a fall of
100,000 in August.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a two-week high
on Thursday as optimism from strong U.S. and Chinese
manufacturing data extended into a second day while the euro
gained, drawing support from solid French and Spanish bond
auctions.
 Asianb stocks also hit a two-week high and Wall Street was
set for a slightly firmer open. U.S. stocks posted their best
day in eight weeks on Wednesday, led by economically sensitive
sectors like industrials and basic metals after the upbeat
manufacturing surveys from the world's two largest economies.
 Investors are largely staying on the sidelines however,
ahead of a 1230 GMT news conference from European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet. The ECB is tipped to keep its
liquidity safety-net for banks in place after leaving interest
rates unchanged as expected.
 ""Low volumes and the fact that people are satisfied that in
isolation equities represent some value (are keeping the bears
at bay),"" David Buik, senior partner at BGC Partners said.
The MSCI world equity index rose a quarter percent to its
two-week high. The Thomson Reuters global stock index rose 0.3
percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.1 percent, with
investors remaining cautious ahead of Trichet's conference and
Friday's closely-watched U.S. jobs report. Emerging stocks
added 0.5 percent.
 ""You're getting a lot of quick, knee-jerk reactions in both
directions. These disparate pieces of economic data are being
reacted to but the information is by no means clear,"" said Angus
Gluskie, portfolio manager at White Funds Management in
Australia. 
 ""We've got the potential for markets to pick up strongly
into the end of the year, but we may well have to go through a
few nervous weeks in September first.""
 U.S. crude oil erased early gains to stand down 0.8 percent
at $73.30 a barrel.
 The bund future fell 36 ticks, while the euro was up 0.2
percent at $1.2825.
 France and Spain sold 12.2 billion euros of bonds, with the
average yield on the 5-year Bono dropping at auction and the
paper easily absorbed as the yield fell after the tender.
 The yen rose 0.4 percent to 84.10 per dollar, off its
15-year high of 83.58 hit last week.
 The dollar lost 0.2 percent against a basket of major

(Adds quotes, detail, market reaction)
 By Patrick Lannin
 STOCKHOLM, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank raised
interest rates by a quarter point for the second successive time
on Thursday and flagged more to come as the Nordic state enjoys
some of the strongest growth in the European Union.
 The Riksbank, raising its key policy rate to 0.75 percent,
kept its forecast for rates in the future unchanged but noted
uncertainty over the outlook for growth in key export markets,
the United States and the euro zone.
 One member of the six-member decision-making board backed
unchanged rates. He and another board member also wanted fewer
hikes in the future, but they were outvoted.
 ""Inflationary pressures continue to be low in the Swedish
economy, but are expected to rise as the labour market improves
and economic activity strengthens,"" the bank said.
 ""The repo rate needs to be raised gradually towards more
normal levels to attain the inflation target of 2 percent and at
the same time contribute to a stable development of the
economy,"" it said in a statement.
 A Reuters survey of economists showed 14 out of 15 expected
a second successive 25 basis point hike while one analyst
forecast the Riksbank would keep rates on hold until its October
meeting. [ID:nLDE67Q0SV]
 The bank has two more rate meetings this year and many
analysts expected it to hike by a quarter point at both,
bringing the repo rate to 1.25 percent by the end of 2010.
 The Riksbank's forecast is for a repo rate of an average
0.92 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, up from the 0.88
percent seen at the bank's previous meeting. 
 It forecasts rates at around 1.9 percent by the end of 2011.
 
 U.S., EURO ZONE UNCERTAINTY
 The main uncertainties about the outlook come from abroad,
the bank said.
 ""Continuing modest activity in the euro zone and a more
protracted recovery in the United States are expected to dampen
developments in Sweden somewhat in the long run,"" it said.
 Analysts said the rate decision was completely as expected
and noted little market reaction to the news.
 However, some saw the Riksbank stance as too hawkish.
 ""There is a big difference between market rates and what the
Riksbank is saying,"" said Nordea analyst Annika Winsth.
 ""We expect that over time they will bring down the rate path
further out ... We are going to be affected by the global
environment more (than the Riksbank expects) and that is going
to impact the rate path.""
 Sweden's economy slid 5.1 percent in 2009, its worst
performance since World War Two.
 But thanks to strong demand for exports and to domestic
demand, it has bounced back strongly. Gross domestic product
(GDP) grew 3.7 percent in the second quarter year-on-year.
 The Riksbank said it forecast 4.1 percent growth this year
and 3.5 percent in 2011. At the same time, prices rises would
remain subdued, with inflation forecast to come in at 1.1
percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2011.
 It would not come in above the bank's two percent target
until 2012, when the rate was forecast at 2.9 percent.
 The Swedish crown rose to a session high against the euro
 of 9.3096 crowns per euro from around 9.3321 crowns
before the decision, taking it close to a two-year high.
 Two policymakers advocated a different decision.
 Deputy Governor Lars Svensson preferred no rate rise and a
lower repo rate path while his colleague Karolina Ekholm
advocated a flatter repo rate path.
 The bank said Ekholm saw a weaker development abroad as
reducing growth and inflation in Sweden too.

 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Asian stocks hit a two-week high,
with Japan's Nikkei briefly rising more than 2 percent, as
strong U.S. manufacturing data further soothed worries about
the global economy.
 The dollar was on the defensive, while commodities gained,
helping make materials shares some of the strongest performers
across the region.
 European shares fell, after rising at their fastest pace in
three months in the previous session. Britain's FTSE 100
<.FTSE> opened down 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> fell
0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> fell 0.5 percent.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of U.S.
factory activity rose to 56.3 in August from 55.5 in July, much
higher than forecast by economists. [ID:nN01115840]
 Coming on the heels of strong Chinese manufacturing data
and stronger-than-expected growth in Australia, the numbers
eased investor fears about the pace of global economic recovery
and helped Wall Street to its best day in eight weeks. [.N]
 But gains in Asian stocks, which were also boosted by
strong tech shares, appeared capped by wariness about whether
the global economy is truly on the path to recovery, as well as
concern about closely watched U.S. non-farm payrolls data on
Friday.
 ""You're getting a lot of quick, knee-jerk reactions in both
directions, up and down. These disparate pieces of economic
data are being reacted to but the information is by no means
clear,"" said Angus Gluskie, portfolio manager at White Funds
Management in Australia.
 ""We've got the potential for markets to pick up strongly
into the end of the year, but we may well have to go through a
few nervous weeks in September first.""
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> pared gains to 0.7 percent after earlier rising
to its highest level since mid-August.
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei <.N225> rose more than 2 percent
at one point, moving further away from a 16-month low hit on
Wednesday, helped by what some market players said was buying
by domestic institutional investors at lows and buying of
futures by foreign players.
 But the Nikkei pared gains to 1.5 percent. It lost 7.5
percent in August and is down roughly 14 percent on the year.
 Seoul shares <.KS11> rose 0.6 percent, led by tech stocks,
with market players saying foreign investors, cheered by the
rise on Wall Street, could turn strong buyers.
 Australian stocks <.AXJO> climbed 0.8 percent to a
three-week high, with miners such as Rio Tinto  gaining
after copper prices rose to a four-month high.
 DEFENSIVE DOLLAR
 The dollar retained most of the losses sustained the
previous day, when upbeat data helped lure investors away from
safe-haven currencies and assets.

 * Ozawa says limited room for BOJ alone to fix yen rise
 * Ozawa says has plans for big tax cuts
(Updates with details)
 TOKYO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Japanese ruling party powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan in a party
leadership vote, said on Thursday that action was needed to stem
rapid rises in the yen that are threatening the economy.
 He also said he had plans for major cuts in income and
residential taxes and promised not to raise the five percent
sales tax before the next general election due by late 2013.
 The race between Ozawa and Kan to be the head of the ruling
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) is too close to call, meaning
Ozawa could become Japan's sixth prime minister in three years
after the Sept. 14 party vote.
 The yen showed little reaction to Ozawa's latest remarks in
the debate with Kan on Thursday. Ozawa's policy platform had
caught the market's attention on Wednesday by mentioning
intervention.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent versus yen at 84.18 yen,
compared to around 84.25 yen before Ozawa's comments on Thursday
reached the market.
 Financial market players have worried the party battle is
keeping the government from dealing with economic woes, including
a rise in the yen that threatens Japan's export-driven recovery.
 A Bank of Japan decision on Monday to boost a cheap loan
scheme has done little to weaken the currency, which is hovering
near a 15-year high against the dollar.
 Ozawa said that there was only limited scope for monetary
policy alone to fix the yen's rise.
 Ozawa also said that solo currency market intervention by
Japan might not have much impact but that Japanese authorities
should be prepared to act.
 ""Room for further monetary policy steps is limited,"" Ozawa
said.
 ""With the global community tolerating a strong yen, it might
be hard for solo currency intervention to have an effect. Still,
the yen's rise has come to a level where we will need to act with
such a determination.""
 The DPJ swept to power a year ago for the first time
promising change, but the party has stumbled on economic and
diplomatic fronts, struggling to craft a plan to end decades of
stagnation and straining ties with key security ally the United
States.
 Kan and Ozawa have clashed over fiscal priorities as the
government tries to deal with deflation, a weak jobs market and
public debt already twice the size of the $5 trillion economy.
 Kan has stressed the need for Japan to debate a possible
increase in the 5 percent sales tax to deal with growing social
security costs for a rapidly ageing population.
 Ozawa, however, has stressed the need to focus on cutting
wasteful spending, although he said on Thursday that he was in
favour of debating tax reforms, including the politically
sensitive sales tax.
 ""I am thinking of big cuts for income tax and residential
taxes ... I think it is fine to debate the tax system in general,
including the sales tax,"" he said.

(Recasts after news conference)
 By Alan Wheatley, China Economics Editor
 BEIJING, Sept 2 (Reuters) - European companies are not
quitting China for other countries despite complaints about the
growing difficulty of doing business, the European Union Chamber
of Commerce in China said on Thursday.
 Jacques de Boisseson, the group's president, said some of the
chamber's 1,400 members had thought about relocating because they
were unable to compete equally with their local rivals.
 ""But we haven't seen this movement becoming concrete, and the
explanation for that is that our members are in China for the
Chinese market,"" de Boisseson told a news conference.
 ""And the business environment in China has a lot of
advantages which make manufacturing in China very competitive
compared to having it in other countries,"" he added.
 De Boisseson was releasing the chamber's annual position
paper, which renewed a long-standing call for equal access to
China's markets and expressed concern that Beijing was
backsliding on regulatory reform.
 ""We need a market which is open, fair, transparent and
predictable,"" he said. ""Improved market access and a better
playing field -- we are convinced of that -- will help China's
transition to a more balanced growth model,"" he said.
 De Boisseson said he would not recommend that European firms
stop investing in a country with such strong growth prospects.
But companies were concerned that the business barriers they were
encountering would dent profitability.
 ""The Chinese government should be careful about its policies,
and there is a risk that in future investment might be reduced,""
he said.
 The chamber said that less than 3 percent of EU outbound
foreign direct investment in 2008 went to China because of the
obstacles or risks of doing business in the world's
second-largest economy.
 It gave the example of how foreign-invested enterprises
(FIEs) are in practice barred from obtaining a wholesale licence
to sell petroleum products.
 To qualify, a company must own a refinery and obtain an
import licence. But Chinese law limits foreign ownership of a
refinery to 49 percent, and no foreign firm has ever been awarded
an import licence.
 ""In other words, it is impossible for an FIE to own a
refinery,"" the report said.
 De Boisseson said the chamber had been encouraged by
assurances by Chinese officials from Premier Wen Jiabao down that
overseas firms would be treated on a par with their local rivals.
 ""But the proof is in the pudding,"" he said. Business wanted
words to be matched by deeds, especially on certification, public
procurement and intellectual property rights, he added.
 EU firms grumble that China's compulsory certification
requirements, discriminatory government procurement practices and
preferential treatment for products containing indigenous
intellectual property all unduly restrict their market access.
 ""When it comes to strategic investments in particular,
European investors continue to be heavily constrained in areas
ranging from telecom services, to insurance, construction and the
automotive industry,"" the paper said.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive on
Thursday, retaining most of the losses sustained the previous day
when upbeat data helped lure investors away from safe-haven
currencies and assets.
 Figures released on Wednesday showed the U.S. manufacturing
sector grew faster than expected and China's factory output
regained momentum in August, while Australia's economy expanded
at its fastest pace in three years in the second quarter.
 That lifted stocks, commodities and higher-yielding
currencies.
 But investors hesitated to take fresh positions ahead of the
European Central Bank's policy meeting later in the day and
Friday's monthly U.S. jobs report, a trader said.
 ""Investors are not aggressively taking risks yet, feeling
they need to see the U.S. employment figures before deciding how
much risk they can really take,"" said Shuichi Kanehira, head of
FX spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The euro inched down 0.1 percent to $1.2794, having risen as
high as $1.2856 the previous day.
 The next target for the euro is around $1.2873 -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of its fall from its August peak of
$1.3334 to its August low of $1.2588. The target after that would
be $1.2923, touched on Aug. 18.
 ""The euro/dollar is expected to stay in the $1.2500-$1.3000
range that many players feel comfortable with,"" said a senior
trader at a big Japanese bank.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against a basket of six major currencies, was steady on the day
at 82.532 after falling 0.9 percent on Wednesday, marking its
biggest one-day fall in six weeks.
 Major support is seen at the Aug. 18 low of 81.912.
 The dollar slipped 0.4 percent to 84.15 yen, moving towards a
15-year low of 83.58 yen hit last week, beyond which lies the
record low of 79.75 yen struck in April 1995.
 Managers of Japanese mutual funds, or toushin, sold overseas
assets as they expect a fall in Tokyo's Nikkei average to prompt
retail investors to cancel their toushin holdings, a trader at a
Japanese brokerage said.
 The Nikkei was up 1.2 percent by midday, having hit a
16-month low the previous day.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent against the yen to 107.64 yen after
jumping 1.3 percent the previous day.
 The ECB is seen keeping its benchmark refinancing rate at 1.0
percent at Thursday's meeting. It is also expected to extend
lending support for banks despite raising its economic growth
forecasts as it seeks to balance a multi-speed recovery among the
16 countries in the euro zone.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to $0.9070 after data
showing Australia's trade surplus was A$1.888 billion ($1.72
billion) in July, below market expectations for a surplus of
A$3.1 billion.
 The Aussie hit a three-week high of $0.9117 on the strong
growth data on Wednesday.
 INTERVENTION JITTERS
 Traders said more players have started to wonder if Japanese
authorities might intervene in the currency market to rein in the
yen's strength even before it passes its all-time high against
the dollar.
 Although many still believe the dollar's drop against the yen
would have to turn much more volatile or deeper for Japanese
authorities to step into the market, some now caution that Prime
Minister Naoto Kan could take action any time before Japan's
ruling Democratic Party holds a leadership vote on Sept. 14.
 Party powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Kan for the
leadership, said on Wednesday he would implement steps including
currency intervention if the yen rose rapidly.
 The race is seen as too close to call.
 ""Things would not look good for Kan if he does nothing,
letting the yen further appreciate,"" said Mizuho's Kanehira.
 ""Investor caution, or hope, towards Japanese intervention
is running high,"" he said.

concern that Beijing is backsliding on regulatory reform.
 In its annual position paper, the European Union Chamber of
Commerce in China listed a familiar array of barriers that it
said were preventing its members from competing with their local

 Such dialogue is vital if European companies, when they
advise their own governments on China policy, are to continue to
advocate open markets, the paper said.

(Adds analyst's comment)
 By Ana Nicolaci da Costa
 BRASILIA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank on
Wednesday held its benchmark interest rate at 10.75 percent,
ending a monetary tightening cycle that helped cool a red-hot
economy as the country gears up for a presidential election.
 Policymakers were expected to keep the so-called Selic rate
at 10.75 percent at the conclusion of a two-day monetary policy
meeting after markets close, according to most economists
surveyed by Reuters.
 ""While it does not expect the inflation rate registered in
recent months to be maintained in the near future, the Copom
sees the continued reduction of risks for the inflation outlook
that has taken shape since its penultimate meeting,"" the bank's
monetary policy committee, known as Copom, said in a
statement.
 The committee's statement makes it clear that, without
anything new, there will be no more hikes in coming months,
said Jose Francisco de Lima Goncalves, chief economist with
Banco Fator.
 ""The statement recognizes that the more recent inflation
data are not a jumping off point for inflation expectations,
but that there's still a process of lowered risk,"" he said. ""I
think it's hard to argue with that.
 The central bank has lifted the Selic by 200 basis points
since April, when the rate stood at an all-time low of 8.75
percent.
 But with the economy cooling from its torrid pace in the
first quarter and inflation slowing, analysts see room for the
bank to hold rates steady through the end of the year. However,
interest rates could start climbing again in 2011.
 ""To bring inflation back to the center of the target,
they'll need to start the tightening process again at the start
of the year,"" said Jankiel Santos, chief economist for BES
Investimento in Sao Paulo.
 The Selic could end 2011 at 12 percent, he said -- still
lower than the 13.75 percent rate as recently as last year,
marking a new era for Brazilian interest rates.

 By Ana Nicolaci da Costa
 BRASILIA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank on
Wednesday held its benchmark interest rate at 10.75 percent,
ending a monetary tightening cycle that helped cool a red-hot
economy as the country gears up for a presidential election.
 Policymakers were expected to keep the so-called Selic rate
at 10.75 percent at the conclusion of a two-day monetary policy
meeting after markets close, according to most economists
surveyed by Reuters.
 ""While it does not expect the inflation rate registered in
recent months to be maintained in the near future, the Copom
sees the continued reduction of risks for the inflation outlook
that has taken shape since its penultimate meeting,"" the bank's
monetary policy committee, known as Copom, said in a
statement.
 The central bank has lifted the Selic by 200 basis points
since April, when the rate stood at an all-time low of 8.75
percent.
 But with the economy cooling from its torrid pace in the
first quarter and inflation slowing, analysts see room for the
bank to hold rates steady through the end of the year. However,
interest rates could start climbing again in 2011.
 ""To bring inflation back to the center of the target,
they'll need to start the tightening process again at the start
of the year,"" said Jankiel Santos, chief economist for BES
Investimento in Sao Paulo.
 The Selic could end 2011 at 12 percent, he said -- still
lower than the 13.75 percent rate as recently as last year,
marking a new era for Brazilian interest rates.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 08:04PM ET</span>",ECB to extend liquidity lifeline as uneven recovery weighs," * ECB expected to hold rates at record low 1 pct at 1145 GMT
 * Likely to extend liquidity lifeline until early 2011
 * Multi-speed euro zone recovery seen weighing on outlook
 
 By Krista Hughes
 FRANKFURT, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is
expected to extend its liquidity safety-net on Thursday,
delaying its exit from crisis support as policymakers confront a
lopsided euro zone recovery and vulnerable banks in perimeter
countries.
 All 78 economists in a Reuters poll predicted the ECB would
leave rates at a record low 1 percent  for the 16th
month in a row in September and the median expectation is for no
change until the fourth quarter of 2011. [ECB/INT]
 The ECB's 22-member Governing Council is likely to decide to
keep lending banks unlimited funds until early next year,
maintaining the lifeline relied on by banks in countries like
Spain, Ireland and Greece.
 Borrowing from the ECB by banks in these countries has hit
record highs in recent months even though total lending has
fallen about a third since July , highlighting the
difficulties still faced by some institutions. [ID:nLDE67I0KO]
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Ireland's credit rating
last week to AA- on the back of an upward revision to the
country's banking crisis bill.
 The 10-year Irish/German government bond yield spread has
hit record highs and spreads on other peripheral government
bonds have also jumped over the last month amid growing evidence
of a split between core euro countries and those on the
periphery. [ID:nLDE67T1D4]
 Germany grew at its fastest rate since reunification in the
second quarter and more than twice as fast as the euro zone
average, while Greece is still in recession and Portugal and
Spain managed just a tenth of Germany's growth rate.
 Analysts said the fragile situation in markets and the
uneven recovery meant the ECB, like other central banks, would
have to tread carefully in pulling back support measures.
 Expectations for unlimited liquidity to be extended were
sealed when even German arch-hawk Axel Weber said it would be
wise to keep borrowing uncapped past year-end, effectively
pre-empting the announcement to be made by ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet at his 1230 GMT news conference.
 ""I'm sure Trichet's not particularly pleased with that but I
can't possibly imagine that they would make any other decision,""
Goldman Sachs economist Erik Nielsen said. ""The floodgates will
remain open through year-end, followed by a gradual exit.""

 GROWTH UPGRADE
 ECB staff are expected to upgrade growth forecasts on
Thursday but analysts said this reflected the strong German
showing in Q2 and was no all-clear for the future.
 ""The hopes the ECB may have had that the (bank) stress tests
would restore confidence are now evaporating,"" RBS economist
Jacques Cailloux said. 
 ""The renewed weakness that we are getting in key export
markets is probably feeding into concerns that we are facing
weakness on the economic front.""
 Most economists in the Reuters poll expect growth for 2010
to be revised up from June's mid-point of 1 percent but for the
outlook for 2011 to remain around 1.2 percent. 
 Inflation is seen below the ECB's 2 percent ceiling, with
most economists expecting staff forecasts to remain around 1.5
percent for 2010 and 1.6 percent for 2011. [ID:nSLAPJE6AM] 
 Euro zone inflation moderated to 1.6 percent last month from
1.7 percent in July according to Eurostat's preliminary reading.
 Still, there are some signs of pressure, notably Germany's
powerful steelworkers union demanding a 6 percent pay rise.
 
 NOT ALONE
 Expectations of continued ECB liquidity largesse have pushed
market interest rates down from 12-month highs over the last
month, although pressure points remain. 
 Turnover in overnight money markets fell back in August
 after doubling in July to more than 1 trillion euros
and many banks still prefer to deposit excess funds back at the
ECB rather than lending them on to counterparts.
 Banks also face a liquidity cliff at the end of September
when they must repay a total of 225 billion euros in 12-, six-
and three-month funds or roll it into shorter maturities. 
 The ECB is not alone in dragging its feet towards the exit.
Although Sweden's Riksbank is expected to hike rates on
Thursday, the Bank of Japan has boosted its cheap loan scheme
and the U.S. Federal Reserve took steps towards further stimulus
by reinvesting maturing mortgage-related securities.

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar jumped more
than a penny against the greenback on Wednesday, while bond
prices fell, as risk appetite rose on strong economic data that
soothed investor fears about the lagging recovery.
 A manufacturing rebound in China and stronger than
expected U.S. factory figures spurred a rally in equity and
commodity prices worldwide, helping start the month on a bright
note after a sour August. [MKTS/GLOB]
 The reports offered some good news for investors to digest
after a recent string of weak data, and easily offset a U.S.
report on Wednesday that showed an unexpected cut in
private-sector jobs. [ID:nWEN9253]
 ""Commodity prices, particularly crude oil prices, were
doing quite well and really quite a strong day in equities so
it feels more of a risk-on kind of environment, even though we
had some mixed numbers this morning,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief
currency strategist at TD Securities.
 As well, manufacturing activity in the euro zone expanded
for 11 months in a row, although the pace of growth slowed,
while Australia's economy grew at its fastest pace in three
years. [ID:nSLAVJE6B9] [ID:nSGE67U0L3]
 The Canadian currency  rose as high as C$1.0485 to
the U.S. dollar, or 95.37 U.S. cents, up sharply from C$1.0665
to the U.S. dollar, or 93.76 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close.
 It finished the North American session at C$1.0520 to the
U.S. dollar, or 95.06 U.S. cents.
 The currency's push higher comes on the heels of a 3.6
percent decline last month.
 Osborne said the Canadian dollar is still trading in a
tight range however, between support at around C$1.0450-75 and
resistance at C$1.0665-70.
 No more domestic economic reports are due this week,
leaving market players to consider how external data will
influence the Bank of Canada heading into next week's rate
decision.
 The next key indicator will be Friday's closely watched
U.S. government non-farm payroll numbers for August, which are
seen falling for a third straight month. [ID:nN31235915]
 Despite the loss in U.S. private-sector jobs, Osborne noted
that one of the strongest components of U.S. manufacturing data
was the employment subindex, underscoring the conflicting
economic data and resulting uncertainty in the market.
 ""It's very contradictory evidence about what those job
numbers might bring,"" he said, although downside risk was the
most likely scenario.
 The Bank of Canada's Sept. 8 rate decision is one of the
closest calls in some time, with market pricing, as measured by
a Reuters calculation of yields on overnight index swaps,
roughly split between a quarter-point rate hike or a no change
in interest rates .
 However, most of Canada's primary securities dealers,
surveyed by Reuters on Tuesday, still forecast the central bank
will raise its key rate by a quarter point to 1.0 percent. But
they also forecast the rate increase will be the last of 2010
because of the slowing economy. [ID:nN31267387]
 BONDS DRIFT LOWER
 With renewed investor optimism and riskier assets back on
the table, Canadian government bond prices slumped, tracking
U.S. Treasury prices lower. [US/]
 Canada's two-year bond  fell 11 Canadian cents to
yield 1.267 percent, while the 10-year issue 
dropped 68 Canadian cents to yield 2.854 percent.
 Elsewhere, the Bank of Canada said its C$1.4 billion
auction of 4.0 percent government of Canada bonds due June 1,
2041 produced an average yield of 3.489 percent.
[ID:nTOR007782]
 ""It was relatively well received,"" said Mark Chandler,
head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC
Capital Markets.
 ""It helped that yields backed up so much prior to the
auction, but in general Canada has underperformed relative to
the U.S. over the last little while, so there were people that
were looking for opportunities to go long Canadian assets.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks posted their
biggest percentage gain this summer on Wednesday after U.S. and
Chinese manufacturing data eased worries about the world's
flagging economy and helped spur a rally in commodities.
 The U.S. dollar and Japanese yen fell broadly after the
release of the manufacturing data and on news that Australia's
economy grew in the second quarter at its fastest pace in three
years. For details see: [ID:nN01127275]
 Oil rose more than 3 percent to above $74 a barrel and
copper hit its highest level in more than four months after the
upbeat economic news boosted sentiment that had been battered
by a spate of recent poor U.S. economic data.
 As investors' appetite for riskier assets rose, government
debt prices fell sharply. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes
and German Bund futures shed more than a full point.
 ""A rebound in risk appetite lured wary investors out of the
relative safety of U.S. dollar-denominated assets,"" said Omer
Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange
in Washington. ""Surging stocks and generally firmer commodities
signaled an improving mood throughout global markets.""
 Major stock indexes around the world rallied more than 2
percent. MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> surged
2.7 percent in its biggest one-day percentage gain since May
27.
 European shares rose at their fastest pace in three months
and Wall Street posted its best day in eight weeks, as the
Nasdaq and S&P 500 stock gauges rose almost 3 percent.
 U.S. stocks rallied in a broad-based advance after data
showed U.S. factory activity grew faster than forecast in
August and Chinese manufacturing rebounded last month.
 More than six stocks rose for every one that fell among
shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Economically
sensitive sectors like industrials and basic materials posted
the biggest gains among U.S. stocks.
 Low volume helped exaggerate gains due to aggressive
bidding by momentum players and hedge funds, according to Jason
Weisberg, director of institutional trading at Seaport
Securities in New York.
 ""They're moving the needle with force, but there's not a
lot of volume behind it. There's a bunch of people trying to
chase returns and this becomes a vicious game,"" Weisberg said.
 Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc , which is
sensitive to changes in economic activity, rose 4.6 percent to
$68.16.
 Energy-related shares rose with as the global economic data
drove up the price of crude oil. The NYSE Arca Oil stock index
<.XOI> rose 4.1 percent and the PHLX oil services index <.OSX>
jumped 4.8 percent.
 The global stock rally gained momentum after the Institute
for Supply Management showed U.S. factory activity rose in
August for a 13th straight month in a reading that was higher
than the median forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters.
 Investors had been expecting the ISM reading to show a
decline in manufacturing from July, which would have fit with
recent data that has depicted a slowdown in U.S. growth.
 ISM said its index of U.S. factory activity rose to 56.3 in
August from 55.5 in July, much higher than a survey of 79
economists by Reuters whose median forecast was 53.0.
 Reduced fears of a further slide in global growth sent
investors into perceived riskier currencies such as the euro
and Australian dollar.
 The euro climbed above $1.2850 at one point and the
Australian currency soared 2 percent versus the U.S. dollar.
 The euro  was up 0.99 percent at $1.281, while
against the yen, the U.S. dollar  was up 0.33 percent at
84.44.
 The greenback was down against a basket of major
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.90 percent
at 82.453.
 ""The acceleration in manufacturing activity in the U.S. and
China alleviates some of the fears for a global slowdown and a
double-dip recession in the U.S,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
currency research at GFT in New York.

 By Aleksandra Michalska
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
major currencies on Wednesday after upbeat data around the
world soothed worries about the health of the global economy,
boosting investors' appetite for riskier assets.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew more quickly than
expected in August, China's factory activity regained momentum,
and Australia's economy grew at its fastest pace in three years
last quarter.
 The euro climbed above $1.2850 earlier and the Australian
dollar soared 2 percent against the U.S. currency as stocks and
commodities rallied amid reduced fears of a renewed global
slowdown.
 Analysts cautioned that the risk rally could be short lived
as the global economy is by no means out of the woods. They
expect safe-haven currencies to remain firm after the yen hit a
15-year high last week on fears the U.S. economic recovery was
faltering.
 ""What we've seen is a bit move away from the U.S. dollar,""
said Brendan McGrath, manager of business solutions at Custom
House, a Western Union company, in Victoria, British Columbia.
 ""Risk is back in favor a little bit today, mainly due to
the good Australian and Chinese data,"" he said.
 In late afternoon trading, the ICE Futures U.S. dollar
index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six
currencies, fell 0.8 percent to 82.500.
 The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.2800.
 The Australian dollar jumped more than 2 percent to
US$0.9092. It had earlier hit a session peak of US$0.9098, the
highest in three weeks, after Australian gross domestic product
data revived expectations of a further rise in interest rates.
 In the United States, the Institute for Supply Management's
index of national factory activity rose to 56.3 in August from
55.5 in July. That was above market expectations for 53.0 and
helped investors shrug off a separate report showing U.S.
private employers unexpectedly cut 10,000 jobs in August.
 The government's monthly report on payrolls is a key
indicator on the health of the labor market.
 YEN LONGS
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 84.41 yen.
It had earlier hit a session low of 83.69 yen, according to
Reuters data, within striking distance of a 15-year low of
83.58 set on electronic trading platform EBS last Tuesday.
 The euro climbed 1.2 percent to 108.02 yen. The yen earlier
came under pressure after Japanese ruling party powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan in a party
leadership vote, said he would implement steps, including
intervention, if the yen rose sharply.
 The yen's rapid advance in recent weeks prompted Japanese
authorities to announce easing measures on Monday. A strong yen
makes Japan's exports more expensive and reduces their
competitiveness. Traders and analysts said that, short of
direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets, the yen is
bound to test its all-time high against the dollar of 79.75 yen
set in April 1995.
 Last week's data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission on currency speculators showed net long yen
positions rose to 51,069 contracts and total long yen positions
hit 63,086 contracts.
 Scotia Capital says record net yen long positions posted at
65,920 contracts on March 25, 2008, with record yen longs at
94,654 on March 4, 2008.
 The larger the number of long yen contracts, the more
speculators will have to scramble to reverse positions to
prevent losses in the event of a decline in yen and a rally in
the dollar. The next report is due out on Friday.

On one occasion, reports that Central Bank President
Henrique Meirelles had spoken of a virtuous cycle of lower

On Wednesday, the yield on the Brazilian interest rate

strong manufacturing data from the United States and China
stoked hopes for a stronger global recovery, which could in

 Lower interest rates could be good news for presidential
frontrunner Dilma Rousseff, the ruling party candidate in the
October elections. Rousseff has a double-digit opinion poll
lead over opposition contender Jose Serra, a vocal critic of
the bank's decision to raise interest rates earlier this year.
 Rousseff is backed by the hugely popular President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva, who has given the central bank autonomy
to set interest rates without political interference.
 Cooling activity has already crept into inflation data,
with consumer prices unexpectedly falling in the month to
mid-August and analysts revising down their inflation
expectations for 2010 for the second straight week in a weekly

105,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 03:00PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Key political risks to watch in Peru," By Terry Wade
 LIMA, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The run-up to presidential
elections, drug violence, strikes by miners and environmental
disputes are all points to watch in Peru, one of the world's
fastest-growing economies.
 THE RETURN OF TOLEDO?
 Former President Alejandro Toledo has surged into second
place in polls for the presidential race after officially
announcing his candidacy. He is tied at 20 percent with Keiko
Fujimori, a conservative lawmaker and the daughter of jailed
former President Alberto Fujimori.
 Toledo is well-liked by the business community. During his
2001-2006 term launched Peru's push to sign free-trade deals
with leading economies and took progressive stances on social
issues.
 But despite solid economic growth, he left office with an
approval rating of less than 10 percent and his Peru Posible is
relatively small.
 Keiko Fujimori, a popular conservative lawmaker, could
benefit from a sizable party infrastructure left behind by her
father. But her candidacy could be hurt by memories Peruvians
have of her father, who was forced from office under a cloud of
corruption and human rights scandals.
 In first place in polls is former Lima Mayor Luis
Castaneda, at 24 percent. He is well-liked in the capital of
Lima but a virtual unknown in the provinces, comes from the
tiny National Solidarity party and has been dogged by
corruption allegations he has denied.
 Castaneda, who like the other two front-runners is seen as
a supporter of policies favored by investors, has yet to unveil
a detailed policy platform.
 He was criticized by columnists last month after he made a
speech to business leaders that contained lots of bluster from
a candidate trying to sound like a statesman but lacked
specifics. Most analysts said his speech was the weakest of the
presentations made by candidates at the annual business retreat
known as Cade.
 The gave high marks to Toledo and Keiko Fujimori and said
efforts by left-wing ultranationalist Ollanta Humala, at 8
percent in polls, to cast himself as more of a moderate were
not convincing.
 Humala nearly won the 2006 race but more recently has lost
ground and the vote on the left could splinter as new
candidates enter the race.
 Alberto Pizango, an indigenous leader, has also said he
will run for president. Members of Humala's Nationalist Party
at times tried to strike a strategic alliance with Pizango but
their overtures were rebuffed.
 A split in the leftist vote would leave the contest to a
clutch of parties in the center or on the right and remove a
potential source of downward pressure on Peruvian markets.
 So long as Humala looks weak, mainstream economic policies,
which have helped Peru win investment grade ratings, will
likely be kept in place at least for the next presidential term
as the economy surges. It is set to grow more than 8 percent
this year.
 None of the parties of the main presidential candidates had
a strong showing when Peruvians elected mayors and regional
governors in October. The results, which favored independents
from tiny regional parties, could make the presidential vote
less predictable than had been forecast.
 President Alan Garcia, who cannot run for reelection, has
said his APRA party has chosen former Finance Minister Mercedes
Araoz as its presidential candidate, though she is far back in
polls.
 What to watch for:
 -- A bigger drop by Humala in the polls.
 -- Clearer moves by Humala to cast himself as a moderate.
 -- More gains by Toledo.
 -- A corruption scandal that could hurt Castaneda
 SOCIAL CONFLICT
 Social conflicts over natural resources are likely to
trouble Garcia as a third of Peruvians live in poverty and many
have been left out of a commodities boom that fueled the past
decade of strong economic growth.
 Peru's ombudsman's office says more than 100 communities
have organized to stop big mining or petroleum projects, and
has blamed the government for failing to effectively mediate
conflicts that pit poor towns in the Andes mountains or Amazon
jungle against foreign companies.
 Hundreds of millions of dollars in capital spending have
been delayed. Farmers opposed to Southern Copper's $1 billion
Tia Maria project launched a new round of protests last month,
saying it would hurt water supplies and cause pollution in the
world's No. 2 copper producer.
 Garcia's push to lure foreign investors to build new mines
in Peru has angered environmental and indigenous groups, which
are becoming increasingly assertive politically but still lack
their own party. Deadly clashes broke out several times last
year and there is little evidence that tensions will ease as
the economy regains steam this year.
 In April, six people died when police tried to break a
blockade of wildcat gold miners protesting a bill Congress
passed to force them to pay taxes and stop polluting. The
protest only ended after the government gave into pressure from
miners to amend the law.
 In November, the government said it would ask a special
U.N. agency to help prepare and evaluate environmental impact
studies for large and complex projects that generate conflict.
 What to watch for:
 -- Strikes that could halt mineral or natural gas exports.
 -- Violence that prompts Garcia to lose support in Congress
or pull bills he has backed.
 -- The United Nations agency could help calm divisions and
generate more credibility for big mining projects.
 DRUGS TRADE, SHINING PATH REBELS
 Garcia has struggled to capture a remnant band of left-wing
Shining Path rebels who run drugs in a violent region rife with
cocaine known as the VRAE, the most densely planted coca region
in the world. Land mines set by the Shining Path killed two
soldiers last month in the Alto Huallaga valley, bringing the
numbers of soldiers or anti-drug police killed in the last two
years to more than 50. More deaths or clashes with the army
could hurt Garcia's popularity ratings and lead to more calls
for a shift in policy as the United Nations says Peru has
overtaken Colombia as the No. 1 coca leaf producer. Garcia
recently indicated he would gladly accept more help from the
United States to intensify anti-drug efforts. Lawyers for the
Shining Path have also talked about forming a political party
to run candidates, but observers say it may be a ploy to win
more favorable treatment for their jailed clients.
[ID:nN15111638].
 What to watch for:
 -- Arrests of key leaders of the insurgency.
 -- Any serious attacks against the army that undermine its
ability to win control of the region.

106,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 02:12PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-US touts Iraq trade mission as war mission wanes," * US says Iraq offers vast array of business opportunities
 * Iraq eyes projects in constructions, telecommunications
(Adds more detail)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department
said on Wednesday it will lead 15 U.S. companies, including
Boeing, General Electric and Wamar International, on a trade
mission in October to help rebuild Iraq.
 ""This mission brings business expertise into the country at
a critical time,"" Under Secretary of Commerce Francisco Sanchez
said in a statement one day after President Barack Obama
declared an end to the seven-year U.S. combat mission.
 The war-battered country needs investment in virtually
every sector, but many foreign companies remain wary of the
security risks. For those willing to take the chance, the Iraqi
market ""offers a vast array of business opportunities,"" the
Commerce Department said.
 Iraq's gross domestic production has more than doubled in
recent years to $112 billion, and the government has budgeted
more than $80 billion for construction, highways, railways,
telecommunications, and security and defense and other
infrastructure projects, the department said.
 However, in a sign of the challenges that foreign companies
face, Iraqi politicians have struggled since an election in
March to form a new government. Also, the World Bank has ranked
Iraq 153rd out of 183 economies on the ease of doing business.
 The United States, which has spent some $700 billion on the
Iraq war, is the country's third-largest trading partner after
Syria and Turkey. The United States mainly buys oil from Iraq
while its top exports to the country include trucks, drilling
and telecommunications equipment.
 Wamar International, whose diverse businesses include power
generation, oil and gas, aviation, defense and security,
already has an office in Baghdad.
 Other companies tapped for the trip include America Cargo
Transport Company, Bell Helicopter Textron, Bond Building
Systems, KT Engineering and Ted Jacob Engineering Group and
ICON Global Architectural Engineering.
 They will travel in October to a heavily guarded hotel in
Baghdad for meetings with senior government officials and
one-on-one sessions with potential business partners in sectors
such as construction, telecommunications and oil and gas.
 Iraq, which has the world's third-largest oil reserves,
was hit by a series of bombings and attacks in August as
United States drew its troops down to less than 50,000.
 Many fear a spike in violence in the months ahead and
wonder if Iraq is ready to defend itself on its own.
 In a Federal Register notice last April advertising the
trip, the Commerce Department warned that ""trade mission
members participate ... at their own risk and are advised to
obtain insurance accordingly.""
 But with overall violence down sharply from 2006 and 2007,
foreign interest in doing business in Iraq has grown.
 ""Companies from Lebanon, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
United Kingdom, Egypt, China and Kuwait, among others, are
already open and operating in Iraq,"" Brian McCleary, a senior
U.S. commercial officer stationed at the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad, said in a recent published interview.
 ""Many of these countries have already led trade missions to
Iraq to capture the opportunities created by Iraq's expanding
market,"" McCleary said.

 * Investors await Friday's nonfarm payrolls report
(Adds comments, details; changes byline)
 By Wanfeng Zhou and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
major currencies on Wednesday after upbeat data around the
world soothed worries about the health of the global economy,
boosting investors' appetite for riskier assets.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew more quickly than
expected in August, China's factory activity regained momentum,
and Australia's economy grew at its fastest pace in three years
last quarter.
 The euro climbed above $1.2850 and the Australian dollar
soared 2 percent against the U.S. currency as stocks and
commodities rallied amid reduced fears of a renewed global
slowdown.
 Analysts cautioned that the risk rally could be short lived
as the global economy is by no means out of the woods. They
expect safe-haven currencies to remain firm after the yen hit a
15-year high last week on fears the U.S. economic recovery was
faltering.
 ""What we've seen is a bit move away from the U.S. dollar,""
said Brendan McGrath, manager of business solutions at Custom
House, a Western Union company, in Victoria, British Columbia.
""Risk is back in favor a little bit today, mainly due to the
good Australian and Chinese data.""
 In afternoon trading, the ICE Futures U.S. dollar index,
which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies,
fell 0.9 percent to 82.490.
 The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.2798.
 The Australian dollar jumped 2 percent to US$0.9080. It had
earlier hit a session peak of US$0.9098, the highest in three
weeks, after Australian gross domestic product data revived
expectations of a further rise in interest rates. In the
United States, the Institute for Supply Management's index of
national factory activity rose to 56.3 in August from 55.5 in
July. That was above market expectations for 53.0 and helped
investors shrug off a separate report showing U.S. private
employers unexpectedly cut 10,000 jobs in August.
 ""Even though there are still many reasons to be concerned
about the outlook for the U.S. economy, the manufacturing ISM
report provided warm comfort for both currency and equity
investors,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at
GFT in New York. ""The real test of the economy will be Friday's
non-farm payrolls report.""
 The government's monthly report on payrolls is a key
indicator on the health of the labor market.
 YEN LONGS
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 84.49 yen.
It had earlier hit a session low of 83.69 yen, according to
Reuters data, within striking distance of a 15-year low of
83.58 set on electronic trading platform EBS last Tuesday.
 The euro climbed 1.3 percent to 108.12 yen. The yen
earlier came under pressure after Japanese ruling party
powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan
in a party leadership vote, said he would implement steps,
including intervention, if the yen rose sharply.
 The yen's rapid advance in recent weeks prompted Japanese
authorities to announce easing measures on Monday. A strong yen
makes Japan's exports more expensive and reduces their
competitiveness. Traders and analysts said that, short of
direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets, the yen is
bound to test its all-time high against the dollar of 79.75 yen
set in April 1995. 
 Last week's data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission on currency speculators showed net long yen
positions rose to 51,069 contracts and total long yen positions
hit 63,086 contracts.
 Scotia Capital says record net yen long positions posted at
65,920 contracts on March 25, 2008, with record yen longs at
94,654 on March 4, 2008.
 The larger the number of long yen contracts, the more
speculators will have to scramble to reverse positions to
prevent losses in the event of a decline in yen and a rally in
the dollar. The next report is due out on Friday.
 In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.0066 Swiss francs,
its lowest since December 2009. It last traded at 1.0071
francs, down 0.7 percent.

 By Jennifer Kwan
 TORONTO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar soared more
than a penny against the U.S. currency on Wednesday and bond
prices sank as risk appetite was revived on strong U.S. and
overseas data that eased recent concerns about the recovery.
 Major U.S. stock indexes rose more than 2 percent after a
closely watched report showed U.S. manufacturing grew faster
than forecast and chalked up a 13th straight month of
expansion. [ID:nN01115840]
 That followed data that showed China's manufacturing sector
rebounded in August after slowing for several months, while
Australia's economy grew at the fastest pace in three years
last quarter.
 The reports offered some good news for investors to hang on
after a recent string of weak U.S. and Canadian data.
[ID:nTOE68001O] [ID:nSGE67U0L3]
 The currency's rise is ""basically a reflection of better
risk appetite"" following the U.S. and overseas reports, which
sent global equities higher, said Mark Chandler, head of
Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital
Markets.
 ""Both the Australian data and the China data gave a little
bit of relief. We've had some pressure on the global growth
story,"" Chandler added.
 The Canadian currency  rose as high as C$1.0485 to
the U.S. dollar, or 95.37 U.S. cents, up sharply from C$1.0665
to the U.S. dollar, or 93.76 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close. At
12:49 p.m. (1649 GMT), it was at C$1.0507 to the U.S. dollar,
or 95.17 U.S. cents.
 The Canadian dollar starts the month on a firm note after
falling 3.6 percent in August.
 No more domestic economic reports are due this week,
leaving market players to consider how external data will
influence the Bank of Canada heading into next week's rate
decision. The bank has suggested further rate hikes will be
weighed against both domestic and global developments.
 The next key indicator will be Friday's U.S. payrolls
report.
 The bank's Sept. 8 rate decision is one of the closest
calls in some time, with market pricing, as measured by a
Reuters calculation of yields on overnight index swaps, roughly
split between a quarter-point rate hike or a no change in
interest rates .
 However, most of Canada's primary securities dealers,
surveyed by Reuters on Tuesday, still forecast the central bank
will raise its key rate by a quarter point to 1.0 percent. But
they also forecast the rate increase will be the last of 2010
because of the slowing economy. [ID:nN31267387]
 BONDS DROP
 Canada's two-year bond  fell 12 Canadian cents to
yield 1.272 percent, while the 10-year issue 
dropped 73 Canadian cents to yield 2.860 percent.
 Elsewhere, the Bank of Canada said its C$1.4 billion
auction of 4.0 percent government of Canada bonds due June 1,
2041 produced an average yield of 3.489 percent.
[ID:TOR007782]
 ""It was relatively well received,"" said Chandler.
 ""It helped that yields backed up so much prior to the
auction, but in general Canada has underperformed relative to
the U.S. over the last little while, so there were people that
were looking for opportunities to go long Canadian assets.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - A manufacturing rebound in
China and stronger-than-expected U.S. factory data spurred a
jump in equity and commodity prices worldwide on Wednesday,
helping start the month on a bright note after a sour August.
 The U.S. dollar and Japanese yen fell broadly after the
manufacturing data. That data and news that Australia's economy
grew in the second quarter at its fastest pace in three years
boosted investors' appetite for riskier assets. For details
see: [ID:nN01127275]
 Government debt prices extended losses, with the price of
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes and German Bund futures
shedding more than a full point, as the strong Chinese and U.S.
data eased concerns about the health of the global economy.
 Oil prices and equity markets extended solid gains after
data from the Institute for Supply Management showed U.S.
factory activity rose in August for a 13th straight month.
 Major stock indexes around the globe rallied more than 2
percent, with MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> up
2.6 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 234.81

 European shares rose at their fastest pace in three months.
The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading European shares
rose 2.8 percent to close at 1,055.69 points, its biggest
one-day percentage gain since late May.
 The Thomson Reuters euro zone peripheral index
<.TRXFLDPIPU> gained 3.90 percent.
 Investors had been expecting the ISM reading on U.S.
manufacturing to show a decline from July, which would have fit
with recent data that has shown a decided slowdown in the U.S.
economic recovery.
 ISM said its index of U.S. factory activity rose to 56.3 in
August from 55.5 in July, much higher than a survey of 79
economists by Reuters whose median forecast was 53.0.
 ""The consensus estimate was for this number to decline, so
it was a very, very supportive number for the market,"" said
Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in
Newark, New Jersey.
 ""It couples with the data out of China, Australia and the
numbers we got out of Germany and India. What it indicates is
the trajectory for global growth is still positive,"" she said.
 Manufacturing growth in Germany slowed in August, although
other recent data show Europe's biggest economy is expanding
fast. Indian manufacturing also expanded at a slightly slower
pace than in July following its economy's fastest growth rate
in nearly three years in the second quarter. [ID:nSGE68002V]
 The reduced fears of a further slide in global economic
growth sent investors into perceived riskier currencies such as
the euro and Australian dollar.
 The euro climbed above $1.2850 at one point and the
Australian currency soared 2 percent versus the U.S. dollar.
 The euro  was up 0.94 percent at $1.2804, while
against the yen, the U.S. dollar  was up 0.33 percent at
84.44.
 The greenback was down against a basket of major
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.89 percent

111,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 12:40PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-U.S. adds Pakistan Taliban to terror list," * Order bars material support, freezes financial assets
 * Prosecutors charge TTP leader for attack on U.S. base
 * $5 million reward offered for top leaders
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Andrew Quinn
 WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The United States on
Wednesday added the Pakistani Taliban to its list of foreign
terrorist organizations and set rewards of up to $5 million for
information leading to the capture of two of its leaders.
 The steps mark Washington's toughest moves against the
Tehrik-i-Taliban, or Taliban Movement of Pakistan (TTP), a
group that claimed responsibility for the failed bomb plot in
New York's Times Square and is increasingly seen as a direct
threat to the United States.
 ""We should be very clear about this. The TTP is very much a
part of the most dangerous terrorist threat that the United
States faces,"" Daniel Benjamin, the State Department's
ambassador at large for counterterrorism, told a news
briefing.
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's move, announced in a
note in the Federal Register, adds the TTP to a list of some 46
groups the United States deems involved in terrorism and
subjects to financial and travel sanctions.
 Simultaneously, U.S. prosecutors charged TTP leader
Hakimullah Mehsud for a plot that killed seven CIA employees at
a U.S. base in Afghanistan last December, and U.S. officials
offered $5 million rewards for information leading to the
arrest of Mehsud and Wali-ur-Rehman, another senior TTP
commander.
 ""These individuals are dedicated terrorists and they are
attempting to extend their bloody reach into the American
homeland,"" said Robert Hartung, a senior State Department
security official.
U.S. military forces have tried to kill Mehsud using
unmanned aerial drones since the December attack. Both men are
believed to be in the tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan, a
haven for militant groups such as the TTP.
Benjamin called the TTP a ""force multiplier"" for al Qaeda,
expanding its reach around the world. The organization also has
ties to Punjabi militant groups and is suspected of being
behind most bomb and suicide attacks across Pakistan.
 The TTP claimed responsibility for being behind the botched
bomb plot in New York's Times Square in May, an attack
analysts said showed the militant group sought to bring its
violent campaign to U.S. shores.
 More recently, the TTP claimed responsibility for attacks
in Lahore in May that killed between 80 and 95 members of the
minority Ahmadi sect.
 Washington sees Pakistan as a frontline state in its war
against the Taliban and al Qaeda and has named a number of
Pakistani militant groups to its blacklist, aimed at curtailing
support for terrorist activities and squeezing them
financially.
 ALLIANCE OF MILITANT GROUPS
 The TTP was formed in December 2007 as an alliance of
Pakistani militant groups to attack the Pakistani state. It
believes the government is illegitimate because it is helping
NATO and the United States in neighboring Afghanistan.
 The group managed to wrest large swathes of territory in
the border area from government control before being driven
back. But it is widely considered to remain a potent threat.
 In the December attack at the U.S. base in Afghanistan, a
Jordanian doctor who won the trust of CIA employees detonated a
bomb hidden under his clothing after entering the heavily-armed
compound outside Khost.
The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday charged Mehsud with
conspiracy to kill Americans overseas and conspiracy to use a
weapon of mass destruction -- in this case, a suicide bomber.
""Criminal charges are meant to deal with Hakmullah if he's
captured,"" said one U.S. official, who declined to be further
identified. ""He can face justice in other ways too. That hasn't
changed.""
 The TPP hit the U.S. headlines again after the Times Square
bomb attempt, which saw a naturalized U.S. citizen of Pakistani
origin arrested after he parked a sport utility vehicle rigged
with a crude explosive device that included firecrackers and
propane gas tanks in New York's main tourist hub.
 Faisal Shahzad later pleaded guilty and said he had
received bomb-making training and $12,000 from the TTP in
Pakistan to facilitate the bomb attempt. U.S. officials say
there is credible information to support the TTP's claim of
responsibility.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 11:52AM ET</span>",World trade grows by 25 pct in 2nd quarter," * World trade grows about 25 pct by value in first half
 * Up 25.8 pct year-on-year in second quarter
 GENEVA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - World trade continued to rebound
strongly in the first half of this year, rising by over a
quarter from year-ago levels, with emerging economies showing
particularly powerful export growth, World Trade Organization
figures showed on Wednesday.
 Trade typically grows and contracts at much faster rates
than the overall economy, but the WTO data confirm the strength
of the global recovery in the first half of this year.
 Global exports of merchandise goods, measured by value in
current dollars not adjusted for price changes, were 25.8
percent higher in the second quarter than a year earlier, after
a 25.7 percent rise in the first quarter, WTO statistics showed.
 That meant trade in the first half of the year was about 25
percent higher by value than a year earlier, but still below its
mid-2008 peaks.
 The second-quarter rise in Russia and other former Soviet
republics was 43.9 percent, and in Asia 37.5 percent. 
 Even North America, including Mexico, outpaced the global
figure, with a rise of 28.5 percent, but export growth in Europe
at 13.2 percent grew at only half the overall global rate.
 The figures are based on monthly statistics from about 70
economies representing about 90 percent of world trade.
 They show that merchandise trade actually declined in April
and May, then rose in June. However, such monthly figures are
highly volatile because of seasonal factors for which they are
not adjusted.
 Global exports in the second quarter were 7 percent higher
than in the first quarter of this year, the WTO said.
 Global exports contracted in value terms by 23 percent in
2009 to $12.15 trillion.
 The WTO expects they will grow by over 10 percent in volume
terms this year after shrinking by 12 percent in 2009.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 11:36AM ET</span>",Swedish govt leads in poll ahead of Sept. 19 vote," STOCKHOLM, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Sweden's centre-right
government may not win a clear majority in the general election
on Sept. 19 and the far right could hold the balance of power,
the latest opinion poll showed on Wednesday.
 The Novus poll for TV4 showed Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt's four-party ""Alliance"" getting 49.0 percent of the
vote against 44.4 percent for the centre-left opposition.
 The poll of 2,000 voters showed the far-right Sweden
Democrats garnering 4.7 percent support.
 This would be enough to pass the 4 percent hurdle for places
in the 349-seat parliament and would make it a bigger party than
Alliance member the Christian Democrats.
 A hung parliament is the one outcome that could upset
markets, which otherwise see a victory for either the
centre-right or centre-left blocs as broadly neutral for
Sweden's public finances and growth prospects.
 However, most analysts believe that market upheavals would
be shortlived in the event of a hung parliament, with a minority
administration able to govern effectively without needing the
backing of the Swedish Democrats.
 Recent polls have shown the government bloc ahead, but only
a couple have given it a clear majority. Support for the Swedish
Democrats has also fluctuated with several polls showing the
party getting into parliament and others showing it falling
short.
 The Christian Democrats and Centre Party, both part of the
ruling Alliance, and the Left Party, part of the opposition
coalition, have also polled close to the 4 percent hurdle in
some surveys.
 Analysts say the outcome of the election is still impossible
to predict and that many voters are likely to make up their
minds at the last minute.
 Both the government and the Social Democrat-led opposition
have promised more spending over the next four years and both
have said they will be careful with Sweden's public finances --
already the strongest in the European Union.
 Both have offered tax cuts for pensioners and more welfare
spending, but the government wants to cut income taxes further
as well, while the opposition plans to raise some taxes to fund
investment in schools and job programmes.

 * Australian dollar soars after GDP reading
 * Chinese, Australian data lift risk appetite
 * U.S. manufacturing grows more quickly than expected
(Adds comment, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and yen fell
broadly on Wednesday after upbeat data around the world soothed
worries about the health of the global economy, boosting
investors' appetite for riskier assets.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew more quickly than
expected in August, China's factory activity regained momentum
and Australia's economy grew at its fastest pace in three years
last quarter.
 Reduced fears of a renewed global slowdown sent investors
into perceived riskier currencies such as the euro and
Australian dollar.
 Analysts cautioned, however, the rally in such currencies
may be short-lived as concerns about the state of the global
recovery persist. They expect safe-haven currencies to remain
firm after the yen hit a 15-year high last week on fears U.S.
economic recovery was faltering.
 ""The acceleration in manufacturing activity in the U.S. and
China alleviates some of the fears for a global slowdown and a
double dip recession in the U.S,"" said Kathy Lien, director of
currency research at GFT in New York.
 In mid-morning trading, the ICE Futures U.S. dollar
index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six
currencies, fell 1 percent to 82.403.
 The euro rose 1.1 percent to $1.2822 and rallied 1.5
percent to 108.34 yen. The dollar gained 0.4 percent to 84.46
yen.
 The Australian dollar jumped 2 percent to US$0.9083. It had
earlier hit a session peak of US$0.9098, the highest in two
weeks, after Australian GDP data revived expectations of a
further rise in interest rates.
 ""The Aussie seems to be driving things on the day. There's
a bit of optimism in the market and the risk-on currencies are
benefiting,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at
HSBC.
 A report earlier showing U.S. private employers
unexpectedly cut 10,000 jobs in August slightly dented market
sentiment, but the impact on currencies was limited.
 The U.S. government nonfarm payrolls report is scheduled to
be released on Friday.

 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - A manufacturing rebound in
China and stronger-than-expected U.S. factory data spurred a
jump in equity and commodity prices worldwide on Wednesday,
helping start the month on a bright note after a gloomy
August.
 Government debt prices extended losses, with the price of
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes and German Bund futures
shedding more than a full point, after U.S. manufacturing rose
in August for a 13th straight month. Major stock indexes around
the world rallied more than 2 percent. For details see:

 The U.S. dollar rebounded to rise against the Japanese yen,
and the Australian dollar rallied 2 percent against the
greenback after a raft of upbeat economic data around the world
lifted the appetite for risk. [ID:nN01115840]
 Investors had been expecting the reading on U.S.
manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management
to show a decline in August from July, which would have fit
with recent data that has shown a decided slowdown in the U.S.
economic recovery.
 The Institute for Supply Management, an industry group,
said its index of U.S. factory activity rose to 56.3 in August
from 55.5 in July, beating a survey of 79 economists by Reuters
for a reading of 53.0.
 ""With the Institute for Supply Management not only showing
a gain from July but completely confounding the consensus of
economists for a sharp drop, all of a sudden the economic world
is not coming to an end, and that is sharpening the appetite
for risk assets,"" said David Dietze, chief investment
strategist at Point View Financial Services in Summit, New
Jersey.
 U.S. manufacturing has expanded every month since August
2009, although the pace of growth had slowed in recent months
amid signs that a broader U.S. recovery was faltering.
 Equity markets already were higher after China's
manufacturing sector staged a moderate rebound in August and
data showed Australia's economy grew at the fastest pace in
three years in the second quarter.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 234.09

points, or 2.73 percent, at 2,171.75.
 Shares of aluminum producer Alcoa Inc  gained 2.6
percent to $10.48, while Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc
 climbed 5.5 percent to $75.94, bolstered by higher
metals prices.
 Copper hit its highest level in more than four months on
the manufacturing rebound in China, the world's biggest copper
consumer, while oil rose to almost $74 a barrel.
[ID:nLDE6800SB]
 Energy shares jumped with the rise in crude oil prices. The

 China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.7 in
August from 51.2 in the previous month, official data showed on
Wednesday. [ID:nBJB003928]
 European PMIs were less positive, showing manufacturing in

 * Akzo shares up 1.5 percent, Sherwin up 1.2 percent

(Adds comments, further details, share price, background)
 AMSTERDAM, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Dutch paints group Akzo Nobel
NV said on Wednesday it would become the primary paint supplier
for the U.S. stores of Walmart, the world's largest retailer,
replacing rival Sherwin-Williams.
 Akzo Nobel, the world's biggest paint company, has been
rebranding its Glidden paint in the United States, boosting its
sales in the important American market, and said last December
it had retained Home Depot as a customer.
 The company said on Wednesday it will develop and
manufacture a portfolio of interior and exterior paints for more
than 3,500 Walmart stores in the U.S. with the transition to
start early next year.
ABN Amro analyst Mark van der Geest said the deal will add
200 million euros ($256 million) in sales with start-up costs of
$25 million to $30 million in the second half of the year.
 ""Good news, as more volume will help AkzoNobel to improve
margins (currently break-even in U.S.), it will strengthen the
Glidden brand and it makes AkzoNobel a more interesting partner
for future consolidation,"" Van der Geest said.
 The deal will propel Akzo Nobel into the number two spot on
the U.S. decorative paints market behind undisputed leader
Sherwin-Williams, and ahead of current number two Masco.
 AkzoNobel shares rose 1.5 percent to 42.30 euros at 1507
GMT, while Sherwin-Williams was up 1.2 percent to $71.24
 ""This is a landmark deal which will significantly boost our
market share in the U.S.,"" said Tex Gunning, AkzoNobel's board
member responsible for decorative paints.
 Sherwin-Williams, the world number three paint maker,
currently supplies the Dutch Boy brand of paint to Walmart.
 ""Walmart remains a large and valued customer of the
Sherwin-Williams company. We don't comment on specific sales or
volume numbers surrounding individual customers,""
Sherwin-Williams spokesman Mike Conway said.
 AkzoNobel acquired the Glidden brand with its acquisition in
2008 of British paints firm ICI, and Chief Executive Hans Wijers
has said all options for the brand are open, with analysts
divided over whether this meant a sale or a takeover.
 Theodoor Gilissen analyst Tom Muller said the Walmart deal
partly relieves the necessity for Akzo Nobel to make an
acquisition to strengthen its position in the U.S.

 SAO PAULO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's trade surplus in
August slipped from a year ago as imports grew faster than
exports.
 Brazil posted a trade surplus  of $2.44 billion
last month, compared to $3.054 billion in August 2009, the
trade ministry said on Wednesday.
 The country had been expected to report a trade surplus of
$3 billion last month, according to the median forecast of 13
economists surveyed by Reuters. Estimates ranged from $2.5
billion to $3.3 billion.
 The surplus rose from the previous month, as exports
climbed. The July trade surplus was $1.36 billion.
 Brazil rebounded from the global financial crisis faster
than many more developed economies. That has pushed up imports,
at the same time that sluggish growth abroad has weighed on
Brazilian exports.
 Exports totaled $19.236 billion in August against $17.673
billion in July and $13.841 billion in the year-ago period.
 But imports rose faster from the year-ago period, to
$16.796 billion last month from $10.787 billion in August 2009.
Imports in July totaled $16.316 billion.
 In May, Brazil's government announced long-awaited measures
to boost exports, including creating a lender, EXIM Brasil, to
help in trade financing.

 * Banks may need fresh capital, but should be available
 * May need to hike rates on CPI/if risk assessment worsens
 * Forint firms on improved global mood in choppy market
 
 (Adds Raiffeisen International comments)
 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Hungary may need the support of
an IMF and European Union safety net if global investor
sentiment turns negative, and such a scenario is ""not at all
unlikely"", the central bank (NBH) said on Wednesday.
 In an emailed response to Reuters' questions, spokesman
Andras Simon also warned that the firming of the Swiss franc
against the forint posed risks to Hungary's growth and could
force some banks to seek additional capital.
 Many Hungarian households have Swiss franc mortgages and are
at risk of crippling rises in their loan payments.
 ""It is important to see that the recovery of the global
economy is still fragile and as a result international investor
sentiment shows strong fluctuation,"" the central bank said.
 ""In case of a negative -- and not at all unlikely -- shift
in investor sentiment Hungary may need the financial safety net
provided by the International Monetary Fund and the European
Union,"" it said.
 The bank reiterated its earlier stance on interest rates,
saying: ""If inflation risks prevail, or the country's risk
assessment deteriorates in a lasting way, raising the base rate
may become necessary.""
 The bank has kept its benchmark rate steady in the past four
months at 5.25 percent, after a long period of continuous
easing.
 Hungary's existing 20 billion euro ($26 billion) IMF deal
saved it from financial meltdown in 2008 but talks on a review
collapsed in July and the government has said it will not seek a
new deal with the IMF when the current one runs out in October. 
 Financial markets have been relatively forgiving since then,
but a fresh rise in risk aversion has driven the Swiss franc to
record highs against the euro and put the forint and government
bonds under pressure this week.
 ""The NBH are rightly highlighting several areas where market
expectations have become divorced from reality, for instance the
downside risks to gross domestic product (GDP) during the second
half from the Swiss franc/forint rate, the funding vulnerability
of Hungary and so the need for a supranational backstop,"" said
Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.
 Central bank ""rates may well need to be raised soon to
maintain risk premia and tackle inflation,"" he added.
 Hungary's forint, which has underperformed other currencies
in eastern Europe this year, hovered around 285 to the euro at
1500 GMT, firming from opening levels of 286.45 as sentiment on
global markets improved and the euro firmed against the dollar. 
 But local markets remain choppy due to prevailing
uncertainty over the Hungarian government's economic and fiscal
plans. Most analysts say there will be more clarity on the 2011
budget only after October 3 municipal elections.
 
 STRESS
 The forint has weakened to record levels as far as 222 per
franc, down 18 percent so far this year. It recovered to around
218 on Wednesday -- still a painful level for Hungarian
borrowers.
 The central bank said its bank stress scenario -- published
in April and based on a forint/franc rate of 215 -- had almost
become a reality.
 The scenario also assumed credit default swap (CDS) levels
200 basis points higher than in April. In April the cost of
insuring Hungary's debt was around 180 basis points while it is
around 360 now.
 ""We are already almost on this adverse path. As a result
based on our calculations, some banks may face capital needs,
but still only to a limited extent (up to 40 to 50 billion
forints or 140 to 180 million euros),"" the bank said.
 It said it was confident that the owners of banks operating
in Hungary would guarantee the extra capital needed, adding the
liquidity position of banks was improving and the exchange rate
weakening was not causing financing problems.
 ""The capital adequacy and as a consequence the shock
absorption capacity of banks with a Hungarian ownership
background is currently high,"" the bank added.
 A spokesman of Austria's Raiffeisen International -- one of
the biggest lenders in Hungary -- said after the NBH comments
that its Hungarian subsidiary was well-capitalised and that it
remained committed to Hungary.
 The central bank said forint weakness has delayed the peak
in non-performing loan ratios (NPL) which it had projected for
this year, and ""is causing higher than expected loan losses in
the financial sector which reduces banks' capital adequacy.""

 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against

 China's manufacturing sector staged a moderate rebound in

 ""A rebound in risk appetite lured wary investors out of the
relative safety of U.S. dollar-denominated assets,"" said Omer
Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange
in Washington. ""Surging stocks and generally firmer commodities
signaled an improving mood throughout global markets.""
 In early New York trading, the ICE Futures U.S. dollar
index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six
currencies, fell 1.1 percent to 82.324.
 The euro rose 1.2 percent against the dollar to $1.2833.
 The Australian dollar jumped 1.7 percent to US$0.9059. It
had earlier hit a session peak of US$0.9066, the highest in two
weeks, after Australian GDP data revived expectations of a
further rise in interest rates.
 ""The Aussie seems to be driving things on the day. There's
a bit of optimism in the market and the risk-on currencies are
benefiting,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at
HSBC.
 A report showing U.S. private employers unexpectedly cut
10,000 jobs in August slightly dented market sentiment, but the
impact on currencies was limited.
 More data on the U.S. economy lies ahead, including the
Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index reading
at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) and nonfarm payrolls data on Friday.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 83.97 yen, after hitting
a session low of 83.69 yen, according to Reuters data, within
striking distance of a 15-year low of 83.58 set on electronic
trading platform EBS last week.
 Dollar/yen hit the day's high above 84.50 after Japanese
ruling party powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime
Minister Naoto Kan in a party leadership vote, said he would
implement steps, including intervention, if the yen rose
sharply.
 In other trading, the dollar fell to 1.0066 Swiss francs,
its lowest since December 2009. It last traded at 1.0071
francs, down 0.7 percent.

 * German drive for tougher sanctions may face resistance
 
 BERLIN, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Germany and Finland will argue
forcefully that the European Union should in future quickly
impose sanctions on member states that breach the bloc's
budgetary rules, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday.
 After meeting Finnish Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi in
Berlin, Merkel said both nations believed budget consolidation
was vital to underpin the shared European currency.
 Reforms designed to prevent a repeat of the sovereign debt
crisis that shook the euro zone this year are being worked out
by a task force led by EU President Herman Van Rompuy.
 In the future, countries which breach the bloc's budget
deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product need to
face penalties without delay, the chancellor said.
 ""Hence Finland and Germany will negotiate very hard in the
Van Rompuy group (to ensure) that sanctions are imposed not
after the three percent limit has been exceeded for a long time,
but that we learn from history and act quickly and decisively,""
she said.
 Only if member states maintained solid finances could the
prosperity of the economic area be assured, Kiviniemi said.
 ""The debt spiral must be broken as quickly as possible,""
Kiviniemi told reporters at a joint news conference.
 Merkel also praised the Greek government's efforts to
consolidate its finances, adding that she favoured closer
coordination of EU economic policy in future.
 Germany and Finland are among the euro zone members which
have weathered the debt crisis best, and secondary market yields
on their bonds are among the lowest in Europe.
 Leaders in Merkel's centre-right coalition have urged the
bloc to tighten up its budgetary rules, but anticipate
resistance from nations whose high deficits and debt have
unsettled markets during the crisis, like Greece, Portugal and
Spain.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The dollar fell versus a basket
of currencies on Wednesday as upbeat data from China and
Australia revived shaky equity markets and gave a boost to risk
sentiment.
 Australia's economy grew at the fastest pace in three years
in the second quarter as households spent far more than expected
while exports enjoyed an Asian-driven boom, reviving the risk of
a further rise in interest rates and leading to a surge in the
Aussie dollar  [ID:nSGE67U0L3]
 ""The Aussie seems to be driving things on the day. There's a
bit of optimism in the market and the risk-on currencies are
benefiting,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at
HSBC.
 Other data showed Chinese manufacturing staged a moderate
rebound in August, easing concerns about the pace of global
growth that are based on weakness in the United States.
 At 1115 GMT, the Australian dollar was trading at $0.9055,
up 1.6 percent on the day and its highest in two weeks. European
stocks were up 1.2 percent <.FTEU3>, with U.S. stock futures
pointing to a positive open <.SPc1>.
 The Aussie's rise contributed to a 0.8 percent fall in the
dollar versus a currency basket to 82.60, down from a 6-week
high hit last week at 83.559.
 The euro  rose roughly 1 percent to $1.2810. Traders
said Asian demand had triggered stop-losses at $1.2710, while a
large option expiry at $1.2800 was also highlighted, potentially
having a magnetic impact on the currency.
 Some market participants said the strong data from Australia
and China had given the chance for investors to cut short
positions in higher-risk currencies including the euro and the
Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 ""The market has taken out those (short) positions, I think
it's probably neutral now,"" said a trader in London.
 Given the market's positioning, he added that very weak
readings in U.S. ADP employment data due at 1215 GMT and the
ISM's reading of U.S. manufacturing at 1400 GMT, may spark
another round of selling in higher-risk currencies.
 Analysts said that while Wednesday's data had offered a
reprieve to riskier currencies, any rallies would be short-lived
as they would likely be met by selling, while currencies
perceived to be safe-haven, including the Swiss franc and the
yen, would continue to rise.
 The euro  rose 0.8 percent to 1.2976 francs,
recovering from a lifetime low versus the euro hit on Tuesday at
1.2850 francs on trading platform EBS. The Swiss franc eased
across the board after a broad rally the previous day.
 Still, it rose to 1.0125 francs per dollar , its
highest since December 2009, as the U.S. currency suffered
against most major currencies.
 The dollar  slipped 0.2 percent to 84.00 yen, while
the euro was up 0.6 percent at 107.45 yen .
 
 EYES ON JAPAN
 The dollar pulled back from the day's high of 84.58 yen and
remains within shouting distance of a 15-year low of 83.58 hit
on EBS last week.
 Dollar/yen hit the day's high after Japanese ruling party
powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan
in a party leadership vote, said he would implement steps
including intervention if the yen rose sharply. [ID:nTFD006532]
 Ozawa, in a showdown with Kan in the Sept. 14 vote for
ruling party leader and hence prime minister, has a strong
political base within the ruling Democratic Party that could
threaten Kan's position. [ID:nTOE68000C]
 Many traders and analysts believe the dollar's recent drop
against the yen, largely driven by falling U.S. bond yields,
would have to turn much more volatile or deeper for Japanese
authorities to take action on the currency.

 * China holds 60 percent of development company
 * Aim is to reduce Nigerian import dependence, create growth
 
 By Chijioke Ohuocha
 LAGOS, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Nigeria is building a
multi-billion dollar free trade zone with Chinese investors on
the edge of its commercial capital Lagos to try to develop a
local manufacturing base and help reduce its import dependence.
 The $5 billion first phase of the Lekki Free Zone, a 3,000
hectare site on the eastern fringe of the city, is 60 percent
held by Chinese investors and 40 percent by the Lagos state
government, the deputy head of the project told Reuters.
 The consortium will provide basic infrastructure including
roads, power plants and water plants before manufacturing firms
are invited to set up business, Lekki Free Zone Development Co
(LFZDC) deputy managing director Adeyemo Thompson said.
 ""We have a number of Chinese companies which are coming in
the manufacturing area,"" Thompson said in an interview.
 ""They are coming to produce furniture, electronics,
pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery. We are having a fair in
November, that is when we kick off operations.""
 The Chinese shareholders in the project include China
Railway Construction Corp., the China-Africa Development Fund
Ltd and the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation
Ltd.
 A total of 16,500 hectares of land bordered by the Atlantic
Ocean and the Lagos and Lekki lagoons has been earmarked for the
whole free zone, which will include a deepwater sea port and a
new international airport in close proximity.
 The aim of the free zone is to make it easier for foreign
investors, particularly manufacturers, to build a foothold in
sub-Saharan Africa's most populous nation and second-biggest
economy while still owning 100 percent of their firms.
 It is modelled on free zones around China which have helped
the Asian giant to develop its manufacturing base and economy
over the past three decades.
 ""We have a one-stop shop ... No investor has to deal with
any government agency directly. We license the enterprises. You
can register your enterprise within a week, get permits and
everything you need to run your business,"" Thompson said.
 ""The free zone allows you to attract foreign direct
investment into the country and investors are given some
incentives ... It helps boost production, manufacturing, create
employment and is a basis for sustainable infrastructure.""
 The manufacturing and agricultural sectors have been
neglected since the 1970s oil boom, when Nigeria began making
easy money from crude oil sales. Oil accounts for more than 80
percent of revenues and more than 60 percent of exports.
 
 SHINING EXAMPLE OR WHITE ELEPHANT?
 Nigeria imports everything from toothpicks to cement, with a
growing proportion of the goods coming from China. The Lekki
Free Zone will enable Chinese and other manufacturers to test
their products on Africa's largest potential consumer market.
 ""There is a huge market in waiting,"" Lagos State Governor
Babatunde Fashola said at an opening ceremony this month.
 ""When you look at how much our people spend importing goods
from abroad, how much they pay in excess baggage at major
airports, bringing this here is like bringing home prosperity.""
 The vast majority of Nigeria's 140 million people live on
less than $2 a day but economists say a growing middle class
means a consumer market is developing that could help its
economy surpass South Africa's in the coming years.
 The West African head of private equity firm Actis estimated
earlier this year that some 10 million people had moved from low
income towards the middle income bracket in Nigeria in the past
five years alone.
 Thompson said China was encouraging manufacturers whose
Western export markets had suffered in the global downturn to
explore frontier destinations such as those in Africa.
 The administrative complex housing Thompson's office,
customs and company registration officials, and a few warehouses
are so far the only buildings to have been completed.
 The architect's models show glistening glass and steel
warehouses around a central lagoon, and the ultimate aim is to
build a mini-city which will house more than 180,000 people.
 Sceptics point to the lacklustre interest in some other free
zones around Nigeria, particularly the $300 million Tinapa
resort in the southeastern state of Cross Rivers, envisaged as a
tourist resort and duty-free shopping paradise.
 Its launch two years ago was marred by armed customs
officers trying to impound products bought by its customers.
 But Lekki's investors say the two are incomparable.
 The new zone is adjacent to Nigeria's most populous city,
Chinese investors own a majority stake, no commercial loans are
involved, and manufacturing -- not tourism -- is at its heart.
 ""The choice of China as partner is because in recent times
they have had experience of transforming an unrated nation into
a world class nation,"" Thompson said.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 06:16AM ET</span>",UPDATE 7-S.Africa state workers reject new pay offer," * Three-week strike in Africa's largest economy to continue
 * Unions say need more time to consult with members
 * Smaller union umbrella group splits over vote

(Recasts with rejection by union coalition)
 By Peroshni Govender and Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 1 (Reuters) - South Africa's public
sector unions rejected a new pay offer from the government on
Wednesday to end a three-week strike but asked for more time to
consult their 1.3 million members in Africa's biggest economy.
 The majority of unions under a coalition, which included
South Africa's largest labour federation COSATU, voted against
the new offer, although some smaller unions in the grouping were
split in their vote. 
 ""The unions met this afternoon and COSATU rejected the
offer. The strikes will continue and we will continue to consult
our members,"" COSATU Secretary General Zwelinzima Vavi told
Reuters.
 Members of the smaller Independent Labour Caucus (ILC) union
umbrella group said there was a split in their vote, although
the group would go with the coalition majority.
 ""Irrespective of what we say, the majority rejected it. But
we must still go to our members and get their mandate,"" said
Manie de Clercq, a spokesman for the Public Servants
Association, the biggest union affiliated to the ILC.
 The strike has ended the national euphoria over hosting the
June-July football World Cup. It has shut schools, led to bodies
piling up at state morgues and dampened investor sentiment.
 COSATU said earlier on Wednesday it was suspending a one-day
sympathy strike this week by all its member unions, including
private sector workers, to give the state workers more time to
consult.
 Suspending the sympathy strike, which could have shut the
vital mining sector, removes some of the pressure on President
Jacob Zuma's ruling African National Congress to reach a deal
fast.
 The government may be hard-pressed to improve its offer
significantly, as it has said its latest offer is well above
inflation -- 3.7 percent in July -- and it cannot afford what it
has already put on the table.
 This could leave union leaders with a dilemma -- whether to
try to persuade members to accept the offer or to press ahead
with a long strike that leaves strikers without pay in pursuit
of a deal that further strains state finances.
 COSATU has more than 20 affiliated unions and claims nearly
2 million members.
 The government offered state workers, including teachers,
nurses, customs officials and office clerks, a pay rise of 7.5
percent and 800 rand ($108.5) a month for housing. The unions
are demanding an 8.6 percent rise and 1,000 rand a month.
 The COSATU leadership, which said its alliance with the ANC
was on the verge of rupture, appears to have taken a more
conciliatory line since Zuma heeded its call for high-level
intervention and ordered ministers to negotiate a rapid end to
the strike, analysts said.
 ""They are turning the taps off a little, but are doing it
slowly,"" said Sakhela Buhlungu, an expert on organised labour at
the University of Johannesburg.
 COSATU has threatened a prolonged strike by all its members,
including miners and factory workers, which would cripple the
economy, if there is no resolution of the state workers' strike.
 South Africa is the world's fourth largest gold producer and
largest platinum producer. The country's biggest firms, such as
Anglo Platinum, Impala Platinum and Harmony Gold Mining , have
stockpiles of ore and would not be seriously affected by a
one-day work stoppage.
 In yet another dispute in the mid-year strike season, the
National Union of Mineworkers said more than 8,000 workers at
Northam Platinum would strike on Monday in a pay dispute.
 Officials have said the government will probably be forced
to make cuts elsewhere and borrow funds to pay for the state
workers' eventual pay rise, making it more difficult to meet its
goal of cutting a deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP.

 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The dollar fell versus a basket
of currencies on Wednesday as upbeat data from China and

sentiment.
 Australia's economy grew at the fastest pace in three years
in the last quarter as households spent far more than expected

HSBC.
 At 0937 GMT, the Australian dollar was trading at 0.9055, up
1.6 percent on the day. European stocks were up 1 percent, with
US stock futures pointing to a positive open.
 The Aussie's rise contributed to a 0.7 percent fall in the
dollar versus a currency basket to 82.60, down from a 6-week
high hit last week at 83.559.
 ""We've seen a reprieve for risk from the data overnight but
I'm of the opinion you sell rallies in riskier currencies."" said
Kenneth Broux, Markets Strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""The market will keep buying safe havens such as the yen and
the Swiss franc if U.S. data continues to disappoint."" 
 The Swiss franc pulled back from a record high versus the
euro hit on Tuesday at 1.2850 francs on trading platform EBS, to
stand at 1.2955.
 The euro traded with gains of around 0.8 percent against the
dollar at $1.2790. Traders said Asian demand had triggered
stop-losses at $1.2710, while a large option expiry at $1.2800
was also highlighted, potentially having a magnetic impact on
the currency.
 Versus the yen, the euro was up 0.6 percent at 107.45 yen.
 
 EYES ON JAPAN
 The dollar was trading flat versus the yen at 84.08 yen, off
earlier highs of 84.58 and still within shouting distance of a
15-year low of 83.58 hit on EBS last week.
 Dollar/yen hit the day's high after Japanese ruling party
powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan
in a party leadership vote, said he would implement steps
including intervention if the yen rose sharply. Ozawa, in a
showdown with Kan in the Sept. 14 vote for ruling party leader
and hence prime minister, has a strong political base within the
ruling Democratic Party that could threaten Kan's position.
 Many traders and analysts believe the dollar's recent drop
against the yen, largely driven by falling U.S. bond yields,
would have to turn much more volatile or deeper for Japanese
authorities to take action on the currency.
 A sharp drop in dollar/yen, such as 1 to 2 percent or more
in a single day towards the 80 yen level and below, is seen as
the most likely scenario that would prompt Japan to stick its
neck out and buy dollars.
 U.S. ADP employment data is due for release at 1215 GMT,
followed by the ISM Manufacturing report at 1400 GMT,
forerunners for Friday's U.S. employment report, which is seen
as the key determinant of risk of the week.
 ""I don't think we'll really go anywhere until Friday's U.S.
jobs data, where I think there's a risk that non-farm payrolls
could come in below consensus,"" said Broux at Lloyds.

 By Niklas Pollard 
 STOCKHOLM, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy will grow
robustly in 2010 and 2011 despite a global slowdown, a leading
think tank said on Wednesday, boosting analysts' expectations
the central bank will hike rates tomorrow.
 The National Institute of Economic Research (NIER) raised
its growth outlook to 4.3 percent this year and 3.4 percent in
2011, up from 3.7 and 3.0 percent respectively in June.
 The government and a number of banks have also raised their
forecasts for growth recently and 14 of 15 analysts polled by
Reuters last week saw the central bank increasing interest rates
to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent on Thursday, despite growing
evidence that global economic growth is cooling.
 The NIER, which supplies economic forecasts to the
government, said household consumption, industry investment and
a rebound in exports would underpin Sweden's recovery.
 ""However, the fragility of the world economic recovery casts
a shadow on this bright picture. The road back to economic
balance is long and lined with uncertainty,"" the NIER said in
its latest forecast.
 ""Exports will be up by more than 10 percent for the full
year 2010. In the following years the market for Swedish exports
will be expanding less strongly, while the Swedish krona will
continue to appreciate.""
 Signs that the U.S. economic recovery may be faltering have
multiplied in recent months, raising fears that its fragile
economy could slip back into recession or face a prolonged
period of lacklustre growth.
 
 MANAGERS LESS UPBEAT
 Reflecting the gloomier outlook for the global economy,
separate data showed Sweden's purchasing managers' index for the
manufacturing sector fell back to its lowest level since late
last year in August.
 The seasonally adjusted gauge, compiled by Silf and
Swedbank, fell to 60.6 points for the manufacturing sector in
August from 64.2 points in the previous month, coming in well
below the 63.6 points seen by analysts in a Reuters poll.
 Fifty points marks the divide between expansion and
contraction in the manufacturing sector.
 ""PMI has been above 60 the whole of 2010. It has fallen back
a little and we think it will continue to fall back,"" Nordea
economist Torbjorn Isaksson said. 
 ""Over time it will tick down toward 55-50. We have a
slowdown in global growth, and that will impact Swedish
industry,"" he added.
 Sweden is still benefitting from a stronger recovery than
much of Europe with strong public finances -- the country is
seen running the smallest deficit in the European Union this
year -- sheltering it from the wave of debt turmoil and fiscal
retrenchment sweeping the region.
 ""PMI came down a bit, but if you compare with other
countries it is still high in Sweden. These are still levels
indicating a good pace in the Swedish economy, so their is no
disconnect between this data and the NIER forecasts,"" SEB
analyst Elisabet Kopelman said.
 ""It is factored into expectations that we have seen a peak
in the industrial gauges. What is important is if they will
remain at levels indicating expansion or not.""
 The NIER institute said it saw the central bank's key repo
rate at 1.0 percent by the end of 2010. Its previous forecast
was 0.75 percent.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - World stocks started the month on
a brighter note on Wednesday as data showed a manufacturing
rebound in China and stronger-than-expected growth in Australia,
while the yen held near recent 15-year peaks against the dollar.
 China's manufacturing sector staged a moderate rebound in
August after slowing for several months, while Australia's
economy grew at the fastest pace in three years last quarter.
 The strong readings from Asia helped offset concerns that
the U.S. economy is slowing to an extent that would force the
Federal Reserve to consider easing policy again.
 ""People are fixated on only two economies in the world:
China and the U.S. It becomes a risk-on day if you get good
Chinese data and a risk-off day if you get bad U.S. data,"" said
Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities in London.
The MSCI world equity index rose 0.8 percent, moving further
away from a seven-week low hit last week. The benchmark index is
still down nearly 7 percent since January.
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index rose 0.9 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index jumped 1.2 percent,
led by mining shares such as Anglo American. U.S. stock futures
rose around 1.2 percent, pointing to a firmer open on Wall
Street later.
 Emerging stocks added 0.8 percent while U.S. crude oil rose
0.7 percent to $72.46 a barrel. German government bond futures
fell 66 ticks.
 
 DOLLAR CANNOT WIN
 The low-yielding dollar, which still tends to suffer when
investors buy into riskier assets and currencies, lost 0.8
percent against a basket of major currencies. 
 The weaker outlook for the U.S. economy itself is also
weighing on the dollar, with minutes of the Fed's Aug 10 meeting
showing the central bank would consider additional easing steps
if the outlook weakened ""appreciably"".
 The meeting was held against a darkening backdrop, and the
Fed, in a significant policy shift, decided to reinvest maturing
mortgage-related securities in government debt so its support
for the stumbling recovery did not fade.
 ""We've seen a reprieve for risk from the data overnight but
I'm of the opinion you sell rallies in riskier currencies."" said
Kenneth Broux, markets strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""The market will keep buying safe havens such as the yen and
the Swiss franc if U.S. data continues to disappoint.""
 The Japanese currency rose 0.2 percent to 84.03 per dollar,
within half a yen of last week's 15-year high of 83.58. The euro
gained 0.9 percent to $1.2797.
 Manufacturing activity in the euro zone expanded for 11
months in a row although the pace of growth slowed, according to
a Markit survey.

wage increases in South Africa's petrol stations, garages and
the automotive service sector planned to walk off the job on
Wednesday, widening strikes that have hit the country.
 Unions representing about 1.3 million state workers, who

 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 1 (Reuters) - About 70,000 workers
seeking double-digit wage increases in South Africa's petrol
stations, garages and auto dealerships planned to walk off the
job on Wednesday, widening strikes in Africa's largest economy.
 Unions representing about 1.3 million state workers, who
have been on a three-week strike, were expected to announce on
Wednesday afternoon whether they will accept a new government
wage offer aimed at ending the action that has shut schools and
caused chaos at hospitals.
 Financial traders have said the state workers' strike has
hurt sentiment but so far has had no major impact on bonds or
the rand currency. One prominent economist said it has cost the
economy about $150 million a day.
 The fresh strike action by workers in the automotive service
sector could affect petrol supplies. At many petrol stations
around Johannesburg, attendants were on the job but were not in
uniform, with several saying they feared intimidation.
 The union representing the sector said workers want a 20
percent wage increase -- five times the inflation rate of 3.7
percent in July.
 Investors also are worried about a one-day strike planned by
all the unions in the country's largest labour federation
COSATU, which claims 2 million members and more than 20 union
affiliates, in sympathy with the state workers.
 The labour action on Thursday could affect mining,
manufacturing and other key industries.
 A one-day strike is not likely to have too much impact but a
prolonged stoppage would further hurt the economy if there is no
resolution to the state workers' strike, COSATU has said.
 The government offered state workers, including teachers,
nurses, customs officials and office clerks, a pay rise of 7.5
percent and 800 rand ($108.5) a month for housing. The unions
are demanding an 8.6 percent rise and 1,000 rand.
 The coalition of more than a dozen unions representing state
workers was expected to announce a collective decision on
whether to accept the new offer on Wednesday afternoon. 
 Some groups may announce the results of the votes of their
membership ahead of that time.
 Officials have said the government probably will be forced
to make cuts elsewhere and borrow funds to pay for the wage
package for the state workers, making it more difficult to meet
its goal of cutting a deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP.
 The strikes have presented President Jacob Zuma with one of
his most difficult policy problems since taking office and
strained a long-standing governing alliance with COSATU.

 * Growing divergence among euro zone countries
 * Output prices rise at slowest pace since March
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the
euro zone expanded in August at its slowest pace since February
as the pace of recovery among member countries diverged further,
a survey showed on Wednesday.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
for August dropped to 55.1 from 56.7 in July but was nudged up
from an earlier flash estimate of 55.0 and marked its 11th month
above the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction.
 The output index slid to 57.1 last month from 58.7 in July
and was revised down from a flash reading of 57.2.
 ""The euro zone manufacturing PMI suggests that the expected
cooling of the sector from the buoyant growth rates seen earlier
in the year is underway,"" said Rob Dobson at data provider
Markit.
 ""Expansion of output and new orders both slowed noticeably
in August although, on current form, manufacturing should
provide a solid contribution to third-quarter GDP.""
 The euro zone economy escaped from its worst post-war
recession in the third quarter of last year and preliminary data
showed the economy grew a faster-than-expected 1.0 percent
between April and June. [ID:nLDE67C0SU]
 But growth is seen slowing to 0.4 percent in the current
quarter and then to 0.3 percent in the following three quarters.

 Services PMIs due on Friday are expected to confirm that the
bloc's dominant service sector also saw a slower expansion in
August.
 
 FRENCH GROWTH SPURT
 Purchasing managers' surveys released earlier on Wednesday
showed manufacturing growth in Germany, Europe's biggest
economy, slowed in August whereas business in France
accelerated. Italy and Spain saw their manufacturing indexes
slip backwards, widening the gap among the euro zone's big four
economies.
 ""Drilling down into the national data highlights just how
uneven the recovery remains. August saw France, Germany and
Austria stay well ahead of a subdued chasing pack including
Spain and Italy, while Greece remained firmly in the grips of a
deep downturn,"" Dobson said.
 As factories struggle to maintain growth they have found it
harder to raise prices.
 The euro zone's input and output price indexes both fell in
August from July, with the latter falling to 52.2 from 52.7 the
month before -- its lowest reading since March.
 Data released on Tuesday showed euro zone inflation slowed
as expected in August to 1.6 percent year-on-year but
unemployment held steady at a near 12-year high of 10 percent.
The PMI employment index held steady just above the break even
mark.

(Changes dateline, adds comment, previous TOKYO)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The yen's rise was tempered on
Wednesday as faster-than-expected growth in Australia's economy
and a rebound in China's manufacturing sector stabilised shaky
equity markets and gave a boost to risk sentiment.
 The yen was also knocked after Japanese ruling party
powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan
in a party leadership vote, said he would implement steps
including intervention if the yen rose sharply.
 ""We've seen a reprieve for risk from the data overnight but
I'm of the opinion you sell rallies in riskier currencies."" said
Kenneth Broux, Markets Strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""The market will keep buying safe havens such as the yen and
the Swiss franc if U.S. data continues to disappoint."" 
 The Swiss franc pulled back from a record high versus the
euro hit on Tuesday at 1.2850 francs on trading platform EBS, to
stand at 1.2900 at 0730 GMT.
 U.S. ADP employment data is due for release at 1215 GMT,
followed by the ISM Manufacturing report at 1400 GMT, with
Friday's U.S. employment report seen as the key determinant of
risk of the week.
 The dollar was trading with slight gains versus the yen at
84.30 yen, off earlier highs of 84.58, though still within
shouting distance of a 15-year low of 83.58 hit on EBS last
week.
 The Australian dollar held gains of 1 percent at $0.9000,
helped by a modest bounce in China's Purchasing Mangers' Index.

 In addition to the fastest growth in three years for
Australian second-quarter GDP, talk of dollar buying by Japanese
investors near 84.00 yen underpinned dollar/yen.
 Dollar/yen hit the day's high after Ozawa called for
measures including intervention to cope with the yen's rise.
 Ozawa, in a showdown with Kan in the Sept. 14 vote for
ruling party leader and hence prime minister, has a strong
political base within the ruling Democratic Party that could
threaten Kan's position.

 EYES ON JAPANE
 Many traders and analysts believe the dollar's recent drop
against the yen, largely driven by falling U.S. bond yields,
would have to turn much more volatile or deeper for Japanese
authorities to take action on the currency.
 A sharp drop in dollar/yen, such as 1 to 2 percent or more
in a single day towards the 80 yen level and below, is seen as
the most likely scenario that would prompt Japan to stick its
neck out and buy dollars.
 But others say yen-selling intervention by Japanese
authorities may occur sooner.
 ""Share prices have entered a danger zone, so it would not be
a surprise to see it happen at any time,"" said a trader for a
European bank.
 If intervention does occur and lifts the dollar against the
yen, a lot of dollar sellers are likely to emerge, he said.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 107.10 yen,
pulling away from a nine-year low of 105.44 yen hit on EBS last
week.
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.2710
, though sentiment was dented by an unexpected fall in German
retail sales for July.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2010 03:48AM ET</span>",Italy Aug manufacturing PMI at lowest since Feb," By Gavin Jones
 ROME, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Italy's manufacturing sector saw
its slowest growth in six months in August and a brief upturn in
hiring came to an end, a survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting
the sector's recovery has already passed its peak.
 The Markit/ADACI Purchasing Managers Index fell to 52.8 from
54.4 in July, staying above the 50 threshold that separates
growth from contraction for a 10th straight month, but showing a
loss of momentum after slight rises in the previous two months.
 The data was well below the average forecast in a Reuters
survey of 15 analysts for a more modest decline to 54.0.
 Manufacturing companies shed staff in August for the 30th
month out of the last 31 after a return to hiring in July proved
short-lived. The PMI employment sub-index, at 49.4, retreated
back below the key 50 mark from 50.4 in July.
 ""These data point to a slowdown of growth momentum across
Italy's goods-producing sector, and add further weight to the
possibility that the second quarter represented the peak of the
manufacturing bounce,"" said Markit economist Andrew Self.
 A rebound in industrial output has fuelled Italy's recovery
from last year's recession, with the economy growing by 0.4
percent in both the first and second quarters of this year.
 Silvio Berlusconi's government forecasts full-year growth of
1 percent, after a record 5 percent contraction in 2009.
 The PMI survey showed orders and output increased for the
11th straight month, but the output sub-index slipped to its
lowest level since May, while growth in new orders was the
weakest since February.
 There was a marked easing in August of input price
inflation, which rose at its slowest rate since January, while
prices charged by manufacturers increased for a sixth straight
month but at a marginally lower pace than in July.

slowed in August and companies cut jobs at a faster pace,

 The NCB Purchasing Managers' Index, which measures Irish
manufacturing activity fell to 51.1 in August, its lowest level

 The reading indicated that although operating conditions in

 Companies shed staff at the fastest pace since March, with
the sub-index measuring employment falling to 47.0 from 48.8 in

 However, while growth in output slowed, there was an
encouraging sign in that new orders accelerated in August for
the first time since March.
 Ireland is relying on exports to help keep economic recovery
on track as stringent austerity measures introduced to cut a
massive budget deficit, the biggest in Europe last year, and a
weak housing market are expected to continue to weigh on
consumer spending.
 Unemployment stands at an estimated 13.7 percent and a

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday as the
Australian dollar surged on faster-than-expected growth in
Australia's economy and a moderate rebound in China's
manufacturing sector.
 The yen extended losses slightly after Japanese ruling party
powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, challenging Prime Minister Naoto Kan in
a party leadership vote, said in a policy statement he would
implement steps including intervention if the yen rose sharply.
 The Australian dollar rose 1.2 percent to 75.95 yen and the
greenback edged up 0.3 percent to 84.47 yen.
 In addition to the fastest growth in three years for the
Australian second-quarter GDP, talk of dollar buying by Japanese
investors at levels near 84.00 yen also helped push the yen
lower.
 ""Ozawa's statement was the third factor,"" said a trader for a
major Japanese bank.
 Ozawa's policy statement comes at a time when market players
are focusing on whether Japan will intervene to stem the yen's
appreciation, although Ozawa appears to lag Kan by far, with a
survey showing on Saturday that nearly 70 percent of voters want
Kan to win.
 Kan said last week that he will take firm measures on
currencies when needed.
 A modest rise in China's official purchasing managers' index
in August lent support to the high-yielding Australian dollar,
which rose 0.7 percent on the day to $0.8990.
 EYES ON JAPAN'S STANCE
 The yen has shrugged off this week's monetary easing by the
Bank of Japan and is still hovering near a 15-year peak against
the dollar of 83.58 yen hit on trading platform EBS last week.
 Many traders and analysts believe the dollar's drop against
the yen would have to turn much more volatile or deeper for
Japanese authorities to take action.
 A sharp drop in dollar/yen, such as 1 to 2 percent or more in
a single day towards the 80 yen level and below, is seen as the

 ""There are many people who have not been able to sell as much
as they want, so I think there will be selling if there is a

 The euro rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 107.32 yen,
pulling away from a nine-year low of 105.44 yen hit on trading
platform EBS last week.
 The Bank of Japan decided on Monday to expand its fixed-rate

 * New exports orders growth slowest in 18 months
 * August inflation steady, but seen picking up
 * Central bank seen raising interest rates next week
 By Yoo Choonsik and Kim Yeon-hee
 SEOUL, Sept 1 (Reuters) - South Korean exports hit a
five-month low in August as the world economy cooled, but an
expected pick up in inflation will likely prompt the central
bank to raise interest rates as early as next week.
 Average exports per working day, a guide on monthly trends
as the country does not release seasonally adjusted figures,
fell to $1.56 billion in August from a revised $1.67 billion in
July, underlining the concerns about a slowdown in the U.S.
economy.
 However, the central bank chief played down the likelihood
for the U.S. economy to slip back into recession and reaffirmed
a commitment to keep monetary policy skewed to containing
inflation expectations as the country emerges quickly from the
global downturn.
 ""We need to be vigilant against the possibility of
inflation expectations rising,"" Bank of Korea Governor Kim
Choong-soo told a seminar hosted by a group of lawmakers.
 ""The Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy in such a
way as to help the economy maintain price stability, while
sustaining sound growth,"" he added, repeating the central
bank's official stance.
 Financial markets shrugged off the data and Kim's comments.
Investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates,
which were slashed to a record low during the global financial
crisis, once or twice more this year after a surprise increase
in July.
 South Korean shares and won rose while bond futures fell as
markets were cheered by surveys in China showing the country's
manufacturing sector staged a moderate rebound in August from a
months-long slowdown.
 ""The series of data and remarks that came today did
indicate the economy is slowing, but not so much or urgently as
for investors to change their views on the economy or policy,""
said Shin Dong-su, a fixed-income analyst at NH Investment &
Securities.
 Although a bout of exports weakness would weigh on the
economy, the central bank has said policy rates are too low
given the country is fast emerging from the global financial
crisis.
 Analysts expect the economy to grow 6 percent this year,
which would be the strongest pace in nearly a decade and far
ahead of most other developed countries.
 EXPORTS WEAKNESS AHEAD?
 Data on Wednesday pointed to weakness in overseas demand
growth for goods from Asia's fourth-largest economy.
 South Korean exports in August rose 29.6 percent from a
year earlier, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said. That was
in line with July's annual growth but was also below market
expectations for a 34.4 percent gain.
 A private survey found manufacturers saw new export orders
growing at the slowest pace in 18 months in August and were on
the verge of posting a decline.
 The survey by Markit Economics showed overall manufacturing
growth had slowed to a 17-month low.
 The economy ministry raised its 2010 export forecast to 26
percent from its late 2009 projection. The revision suggests
annual exports growth for the rest of this year would slow to
around 15 percent from 33 percent so far this year, a Reuters
calculation showed.
 Consumer inflation in August held steady at an annual rate
of 2.6 percent, as expected, but core inflation -- which strips
off volatile fuel and food prices -- edged up to a six-month
high of 1.8 percent.
 The central bank has said inflation would start picking up
later this year as the economy and employment picks up, to rise
above the middle of the 2-4 percent central bank target.
 South Korea's annual consumer inflation averaged at 2.6
percent for the past one year, way below 3.3 percent for the
preceding three years, government data shows.
 The Bank of Korea surprised markets in July by raising the
policy interest rate to 2.25 percent from record-low 2 percent
in its first tightening since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
 The central bank held the base rate steady in August but
flagged tightening ahead. It reviews policy on Sept. 9.

 * Intervention possible given slump in Tokyo shares -trader
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - The yen edged up toward a 15-year
peak against the dollar on Wednesday, having shrugged off this
week's monetary easing by the Bank of Japan and putting the focus
on whether Japan will intervene to stem the yen's rise.
 Many traders and analysts believe the dollar's drop against
the yen would have to turn much more volatile or deeper for
Japanese authorities to take action.
 A sharp drop in dollar/yen, such as 1 to 2 percent or more in
a single day towards the 80 yen level and below, is seen as the
most likely scenario that would prompt Japan to stick its neck
out and buy dollars.
 But others say yen-selling intervention by Japanese
authorities may occur sooner.
 ""Share prices have entered a danger zone, so it would not be
a surprise to see it happen at any time,"" said a trader for a
European bank.
 If intervention does occur and lifts the dollar against the
yen, a lot of dollar sellers are likely to emerge, he said.
 ""There are many people who have not been able to sell as much
as they want, so I think there will be selling if there is a
(dollar) rebound,"" the trader said.
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent from late U.S. trading on
Tuesday to 84.09 yen.
 The euro eased 0.1 percent against the yen to 106.64 yen, in
sight of a nine-year low of 105.44 yen hit on trading platform
EBS last week.
 Later on Wednesday, investors may take cues from China's
official Purchasing Managers' Index for August, with the market
looking for a slight rebound from a 17-month low hit in July. The
data is seen edging up to 51.8 in August, from 51.2.
 Anything softer would only add to investors' fears of a
global slowdown, lifting the yen and sovereign bonds, while it
could take a much stronger outcome to lighten the gloomy mood.
 Some traders think a fall in the dollar below last week's
15-year low of 83.58 yen would be enough to trigger yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities.
 The Bank of Japan's decision on Monday to expand its
fixed-rate fund supply scheme to 30 trillion yen from 20 trillion
yen, and to launch a new six-month loan operation has done little
to curb the yen's rise.
 Both Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda started to hint recently at possible action to
counter the yen's strength, raising speculation that Japanese
intervention may be just around the corner.
 But Japan might find it hard to convince other G7 members
about the need to intervene at a time when they are calling on
China to make its yuan more flexible to ease global imbalances.
 An attempt to lower the yen could also run counter to U.S.
President Barack Obama's plan to double U.S. exports, especially
with mid-term congressional elections approaching in November,
raising diplomatic obstacles to intervention by Tokyo.
 The yen has been on an uptrend against the dollar as U.S.
Treasury yields tumbled over the past few months on mounting
signs the economic recovery in the United States was faltering.
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.2685.
The euro held steady against the Swiss franc at 1.2874 franc,
having trimmed some losses after hitting a record low of 1.2850
francs on Tuesday.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Trade on global currency markets
has jumped by a fifth over the past three years to $4 trillion a
day, roughly equal to the annual economic output of Germany, a
major central bank survey showed on Wednesday.
 The three-yearly survey by the Bank for International
Settlements showed growth driven by the rising power of hedge
funds, insurance firms, central banks and other non-bank
financial institutions while ease of trading over electronic
platforms has enhanced the appeal of retail trading.
 The survey also showed London has further cemented its
prominence as the centre for forex markets, with investors
undeterred by the financial market turmoil and troubles in the
banking sector that erupted in the autumn of 2008.
 The increase in volumes was driven by a 48 percent jump in
turnover of conventional spot transactions, BIS said in they
survey, which is watched closely by banks and institutions as a
comprehensive snapshot of currency market trading.
 Growth in the spot market partly reflects the continued rise
of algorithmic trading, where so-called black boxes can process
thousands of trades a minute.
 The BIS survey, in which 53 central banks and monetary
authorities participated, showed transactions by once-dominant
interbank dealers were surpassed for the first time by non-bank
institutions like hedge funds and central banks.

 ""FX remains a very fertile environment and the number of
participants and the number of types of participants has grown,""
said Alan Bozian, CEO of FX settlement system CLS Bank.
 
 TRADING IN YEN, AUSSIE RISES
 The dollar remained king but the share of trading that
involves it continued to wane from a 90 percent peak reached in
2001, from 85.6 percent in April 2004 to 84.9 percent in April
2010. The fall benefited the euro, other G-10 and emerging
market currencies.
 The survey provides the first snapshot of the currency
markets since the 2008 financial crisis. It reflects a period
that saw the end of the boom in the carry trade -- where money
is borrowed in low-yielding currencies to fund higher yielding
investments -- followed by a substantial unwinding of it.
 The share of the low-yielding Japanese yen and the
higher-yielding Australian dollar therefore rose as a percentage
of all transactions. Because two currencies are involved in each
transaction, the sum of the percentage shares of individual
currencies totals 200 percent instead of 100 percent.
 Euro/dollar  remained by far the most dominant
currency pair with a 28 percent share, followed by dollar/yen
 with a slight increase to 14 percent of turnover.
 The sterling/dollar  pair continued to retreat from
its peak in 2004 to a 9 percent share, about the level reached
in 1998, prior to the euro's inception.

 TURNOVER JUMPS IN JAPAN
 The overwhelming majority of currency trading continues to
occur in Britain and the United States due to the depth of their
markets.
 London maintained its title as the world's currency trading
hub in 2007-2010 as the share of average daily turnover in the
UK rose roughly by a quarter to $1.9 trillion. That was more
than double the turnover in the United States, the No. 2 centre.
 The BIS survey also showed turnover jumped in Japan, which
nudged out Singapore and Switzerland to take the No. 3 spot.
 The over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market also saw
strong growth, with daily turnover 24 percent to $2.1 trillion.
 This was due mainly to growth in forward rate agreements --
under which investors can swap fixed interest rates for floating
interest rates -- which jumped by 132 percent.
 In contrast, interest rate swaps turnover was mostly
unchanged in the major currencies, while turnover in interest
rate options fell slightly in most currency denominations.
 The BIS plans to publish in November detailed results of
April 2010 activity, as well as positions as at end-June 2010 on
foreign exchange instruments.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Growing fears of a double-dip
U.S. recession weighed on global stocks and oil prices on
Tuesday, pushing investors into the safe-haven yen, which
neared a 15-year peak versus the dollar.
 Investors also rushed to the relative safety of gold and
U.S. Treasury debt. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasuries were
on track to record their largest monthly drop since November
2008, when financial markets were reeling from the Lehman
Brothers collapse.
 Oil prices, viewed as a proxy for the global economy,
slumped nearly 4 percent.
 Worries about the world's largest economy have been boosted
by recent reports showing a marked economic slowdown. The
latest bad data included an index of business activity in the
U.S. Midwest, which rose less than economists expected. For
details, see [ID:nN31183001].
 Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy
meeting, in which policymakers saw increasing risks to economic
growth, also contributed to the cautious mood. [ID:nN31253959]
 U.S. stocks were supported somewhat, however, by data
showing a modest rise in the confidence of U.S. consumers in
August, coupled with a larger-than-expected rise in U.S. home
prices in June. [ID:nN31237504]
 ""Markets responded to the better-than-expected U.S.
consumer confidence, but the markets have not made their mind
up about the recovery,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at
Brewin Dolphin. ""There are still worries about a double-dip
recession.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended up 4.99
points, or 0.05 percent, at 10,014.72, while the Standard &

points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,114.03.
 For the month, both the Dow and the S&P 500 lost more than
4 percent. The Nasdaq fell more than 6 percent.
 European stocks erased losses after the U.S. consumer
confidence data but still recorded their largest monthly
decline in August since May.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
eked out a gain of 0.08 percent after falling as much as 1.3

 In another sign of investor concern about the
sustainability of the global recovery, oil prices fell for the
second consecutive session.
 U.S. crude oil prices for October delivery  settled
down $2.78, or 3.72 percent, at $71.92 a barrel. The contract
extended losses after settlement, tumbling 4.4 percent from the
Monday close to $71.53 a barrel.
 YEN NEARS 15-YEAR HIGH
 The yen on Tuesday neared a 15-year high against the
dollar, marking its fourth monthly rise, as U.S. economic
concerns boosted the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese
currency.
 The strengthening of the yen came despite Japan's decision
to expand cheap loans to banks, a symbolic monetary easing move
considered a sign that authorities may act further to stop the
currency appreciation.
 ""The policy action by the BoJ isn't going to change the
market's mood. It would probably take intervention to shake
things up a bit,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist
at Wells Fargo in New York.
 The dollar was down 0.69 percent against the yen  at
84.02. It had earlier fallen to 84.83, according to Reuters
data, not far from its 15-year low of 83.58 set on electronic
trading platform EBS last week.
 The euro  was up 0.12 percent at $1.2678.
 U.S. Treasury prices gained further as investors sought
safety amid signs of a faltering economy.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
17/32 in price, with the yield at 2.47 percent. The 30-year
bond  rose 36/32, with the yield at 3.522 percent.
 August has proven a banner month for government bonds, with
benchmark 10-year notes and the 30-year bond on track for the
biggest monthly dip in yield since November 2008, when the
financial sector was reeling from the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy and the credit crisis reached its peak.
 Spot gold , another safe-haven investment, gained
$10.35, or 0.84 percent, to $1,246.60, the highest since late
June.

 BRATISLAVA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Slovakia will cut state
budget expenditure by at least 900 million euros ($1.14
billion) next year, Prime Minister Iveta Radicova said on
Tuesday.
 She added that a complete austerity package will be
presented next Monday. The euro zone's poorest member wants to
cut its fiscal deficit to below the European Union's official
limit of 3 percent of the gross domestic product by end-2013,
from 7 to 9 percent of GDP expected this year.
 ""This (900 million euros) will come from a 10 percent cut
in ministries' common expenditures and wages, curbs in public
procurement costs and cut in expenditures seen as a waste of
money,"" Radicova told reporters after meeting of leaders of her
centre-right coalition.
 The remaining share in an anticipated 1.7 billion euro
austerity package, equalling 2.5 percentage points of GDP,
should come from higher state budget revenue, worth up to 800
million euros.
 ""It will less (than 800 million euros), very likely,""
Radicova said. But she declined to comment on a possible hike
in the value-added-tax, a scenario favoured by analysts.
 Finance Minister Ivan Miklos, a fiscal hawk charged with
engineering sound and gradual fiscal consolidation without
harming an economic recovery, said earlier this month that cuts
in expenditures should cover two-thirds of the planned
tightening.
 Slovakia will miss the 5.5 percent of GDP deficit target
agreed with the European Commission for this year, after a 7.3
percent deficit in 2009, due to significant shortfall in tax
revenues due.
 The heavily export-reliant economy is expected to be among
the European Union's fastest-growing this year, but that will
be based mainly on exports and foreign-owned producers who
bring in little budget revenue.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen was on track for its
fourth consecutive monthly advance against the dollar on
Tuesday, its longest winning streak in 19 months, as investors
shrugged off Japan's latest easing move.
 Demand for the safe-haven currency rose in the past month
as U.S. Treasury yields tumbled amid mounting signs the
economic recovery in the United States was faltering.
 The rapid advance, which pushed the yen to a 15-year high
this month, prompted Japanese authorities to announce measures
on Monday to curb the yen's strength to protects the country's
exports.
 Traders and analysts saw the central bank's moves as a
symbolic gesture that will do little to halt the climb, and
said that short of direct intervention in the foreign exchange
markets, the yen is bound to test its all-time high of 79.75
yen set in April 1995, according to Reuters data.
 ""The policy action by the BoJ isn't going to change the
market's mood. It would probably take intervention to shake
things up a bit,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist
at Wells Fargo in New York.
 But Serebriakov and other analysts pointed to the recent
experiences of central banks' moves in forex markets. They
caution that direct intervention may have limited impact.
 ""We're not even sure that (intervention) would cause a
sustained reversal of yen strength,"" he said. 
 Japan last sold yen in the markets to weaken it in March
2004, with mixed results.
 In early afternoon trading, the dollar was down 0.6 percent
at 84.11 yen. It had earlier fallen to 83.96, according to
Reuters data, not far from its 15-year low of 83.58 set on
electronic trading platform EBS last week.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to 106.77 yen.
""The yen has a little further to go,"" said Daniel Katzive,
currency strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. ""We think
dollar/yen can get down to 82 in the near term."" 
 Katzive explained that with global benchmarks yields near
or at record low levels, Japanese investors would need more
incentive to take risk in foreign markets, helping sustain
demand for the yen.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on
Tuesday that the government would take decisive action on
currencies -- usually seen as code for intervention -- when
necessary.
 INTERVENTION RISK
 The dollar has fallen almost 3 percent against the yen this
month and is down more than 9 percent this year.
 Traders say Japanese authorities are expected to buy the
dollar against the yen if the dollar slides 3-4 yen in one day.
For Q+A on whether Japan will intervene to curb the yen's rise,
click on. Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, could push the yen
higher if they show further deterioration in the economy and
weigh on bond yields, analysts said.
 The yen could also face potential buyback pressure in cross
trades such as euro/yen and Aussie/yen, which have attracted
some interest because of their larger yield differentials.
 Against the dollar, the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.2705,
helped in part by strong job numbers from Germany.
 The euro slumped to a record low against the safe-haven
Swiss franc, removing barriers at 1.2900 on the way. The euro
fell as low as 1.2878 francs on EBS. The dollar fell to a

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce
Department, in a decision that could provoke congressional
action, said on Tuesday it did not see strong enough legal
grounds to investigate if China's currency practices subsidize
its exports.
 It made the decision in separate trade cases involving
imports of coated paper and aluminum ""extrusions"" from China.
 In both cases, U.S. petitioners argued China effectively
subsidized exports by keeping its currency at an artificially
low value to the dollar and asked the department to impose
countervailing duties in response.
 ""The allegations made by domestic producers do not meet the
statutory standard for initiating an investigation,"" deputy
assistant secretary for import administration Ronald K.
Lorentzen said in a statement.
 However, the department did announce it has set preliminary
countervailing duties ranging from 6.18 to 137.65 percent on
aluminum extrusions from China to offset other subsidies
alleged in the case. The United States imported more than $500
million of the goods from China last year.
 Many U.S. manufacturers and lawmakers believe China's
currency is undervalued by as much as 40 percent, which they
say gives Chinese companies an unfair trade advantage.
 Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, who has been
pushing for action on China's currency in the Senate,
criticized the Commerce Department's ""incomplete"" decision.
 ""Once again, even when the opportunity is thrust into its
hands, the administration has refused to take action,"" Schumer
said.
 The House of Representative Ways and Means Committee will
hold a hearing Sept. 15 on the concern and is expected to hear
testimony from lawmakers and groups supporting legislation to
address the situation.
 The United Steelworkers union and aluminum extrusion
producers in nine states asked the Commerce Department in April
to impose countervailing duties over China's yuan as part of a
broader case alleging a long list of government subsidies and
unfair pricing practices.
 Since then, agency officials had been mulling whether they
had strong legal grounds to launch a formal investigation into
the charge China effectively subsidizes its exports by keeping
its currency undervalued against the dollar.
 Under both U.S. and WTO law, a subsidy is defined as a
financial contribution from the government which provides a
benefit to a specific industry.
 In the aluminum case and a separate one involving coated
paper, U.S. petitioners have argued the benefits that come from
the Chinese government controlling its currency are specific to
Chinese exporters since they account for about 70 percent of
the country's foreign exchange transactions.
 But Lorentzen said department officials determined the
currency allegation did not meet ""the requirement that benefits
provided under China's unified foreign exchange regime be
specific to the enterprise or industries being investigated.""

 (Updates prices, adds comment, detail, changes dateline,

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A jump in euro zone inflation
lifted the euro back above $1.37 on Monday and bolstered the
view that interest rates in the region could rise more quickly
than in the United States and other advanced economies.
 That helped the euro reverse the losses it suffered on
Friday as unrest in Egypt drove up oil prices and sparked a
safe-haven bid for dollars and Swiss francs.
 Asian central banks and some Middle East accounts were
among the most active euro buyers, traders said, and look
likely to help drive it toward $1.40 in the weeks ahead,
provided trouble in Egypt does not spread to other countries in
the Middle East.
 ""Equities seem a bit shaky, but tension surrounding the
situation in Egypt is calming as far as the currency market is
concerned,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director of Faros
Trading, managing director at FX advisory and execution firm
Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.
 He said euro zone inflation concerns and month-end buying
could drive the euro to $1.3750, adding ""$1.40 is still on the
cards"", particularly if Egypt tensions die down.
 The euro was last changing hands at $1.3713 , up 0.7
percent. Overnight, $1.3570, the 61.8 percent retracement of
its November-to-January decline, acted as solid support,
bringing in buyers from Asia and the Middle East.
 The euro also rebounded to 1.2908 Swiss francs ,
up 0.7 percent, after falling more than 1 percent on Friday. It
rose 0.7 percent to 112.54 yen . The dollar was flat
at 82.05 yen .
 EURO ZONE INFLATION
 The euro is up 2.5 percent against the dollar so far this
year, with most of the gains coming since Jan. 10. Data Monday
showed euro zone inflation up 2.4 percent in the year to
January, above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target.
[ID:nBRLVCE7AU]
 That should bolster the view that the ECB could hike
interest rates much sooner than the Federal Reserve. ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet has repeatedly warned about price
pressures, and markets will listen closely when he addresses
the media this week after the bank's policy meeting.
 ""Trichet has warned of a hump in inflation, this data shows
a rise in inflation, and the market has reacted to it,"" said
Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 The three-month Euribor rate  -- a mix of
interest rate expectations and banks' appetite for lending --
rose to 1.074 percent from 1.063 percent, the highest since
July 2009. [ID:nEAP000437].
 The main caveat for currency traders remains Egypt, though.
Protests there show no sign of abating, and investors are wary
that political upheaval could hit other Arab countries,
disrupting oil production and heightening regional tensions.
[ID:nLDE70U00B]
 ""If the trouble really spreads and it pushes the oil price
up even more, then that would probably spark more short-term
flows into the dollar,"" said Karl Olsson, currency strategist
at SEB in Stockholm.
 Crude oil  was up 0.1 percent at $89.52 per barrel
briefly rising above $90 in European morning trade. It remained
supported on Middle-East supply concerns and traded around four
percent above Friday's low.

 The European Commission, the EU's executive, has told member
states it wants to investigate the sector and has until
mid-September to launch a full study, diplomats say. Such a move
would add pressure to already tense EU-China trade relations.
 The Commission's desire to investigate follows a complaint
by Belgian group Option, Europe's sole producer of the wireless
Internet devices and a supplier of modems to telecoms giants
such as Vodafone and Telefonica.
 According to Option's complaint, seen by Reuters, China's
modem producers receive direct government grants, cheap loans
and state-backed R&D as part of China's efforts to shift from a
major low-tech exporter into a top player in global telecoms.
 ""China's government policies are aimed at raising up and
supporting domestic companies in the telecommunication and
information technology sectors with the express purpose of
making them global champions,"" the complaint says.
 China exported about 25 million wireless modems -- used to
access the Internet on laptops and handhelds -- worth around
1.25 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in 2009. Its exports made up
90 percent of European modem imports, according to EU estimates.
 Option said on Tuesday that pressure from cheaper Chinese
imports could prevent it from increasing revenue in the second
half of the year. Its shares plunged by as much as 18 percent.
 The Commission has until mid-September to start a 13-month
investigation, which could lead to steep import tariffs valid
for five years. EU capitals must this week oppose or tacitly
approve the Commission plan, according people close to the case.
 Tariff hikes and a possible import limit on Chinese modems
resulting from the investigation could hurt China's two leading
producers, Huawei Technologies and ZTE.
 EU member states have in the past given their backing to
subsidy complaints, but one EU diplomat said the Chinese
subsidies targeted in this complaint could be legal.
 
 TRADE ASSAULT
 If opened, the investigation would represent the first time
the EU has rolled out three trade defense instruments at once
against one of its trading partners and highlights the EU's
willingness to face down exporting powerhouse China, its biggest
trade partner after the United States.
 In June, the EU started a dual investigation into alleged
market dumping by Chinese wireless modem exporters and into
whether the EU should resort to emergency safeguards to protect
Option from sudden surges in Chinese imports.
 A Chinese official in Brussels said China will consult with
the EU on the investigation. 
 Last month, China's Ministry of Commerce criticised the June
investigations calling them trade protectionism.
 People familiar with the case say Beijing will point to
Option's production facilities in China and allege Commission
bias to discredit the claim.

 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained modestly
and European shares pared losses on Tuesday after a rise in
U.S. consumer confidence, but persistent fears of a slowing
economy weighed on oil prices and the dollar.
 Concerns about the health of the U.S. economy had earlier
pushed investors into safe-haven assets, sending the yen to a
near 15-year peak and gold prices to a two-month peak.
 But a report showing that an index of U.S. consumer
confidence rose above expectations in August, combined with a
larger-than-forecast increase in prices of U.S. single-family
homes in June, lifted investor sentiment.
 ""Consumer confidence is the second positive surprise we've
had today. Does that mean we've hit the peak of bearishness
yet? If not, we're probably close,"" said Uri Landesman,
president of Platinum Partners in New York.
 ""I think these two data points, combined, will prevent what
would've been a pretty bad day.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> climbed 17 points,
or 0.17 percent, at 10,025, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> rose 0.68 point, or 0.06 percent, at 1,049. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slipped 4 points, or 0.22
percent, at 2,115.
 The MSCI All-Country World equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
trimmed losses but remained 0.23 percent lower. The same
happened to the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European
shares, which dipped only 0.1 percent after falling as much as
1.3 percent earlier.
 The U.S. dollar pared losses against major currencies
following the confidence data.
 The dollar was down 0.25 percent against the Japanese
currency  at 84.39. It had earlier fallen to 84.06,
according to Reuters data, not far from its 15-year low of
83.58 set on electronic trading platform EBS last week.
 The euro  was up 0.45 percent at $1.272.
 The dollar was also down 0.24 percent against a basket of
major currencies measured by the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>.
 U.S. Treasury prices gave back some of their earlier gains
but remained higher, in a sign that investors are still weary
of the U.S. economic outlook.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
7/32 in price, with the yield at 2.5054 percent. The 30-year
bond  was up 13/32, with the yield at 3.5595
percent.
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell 33 cents, or 0.44

 * Global mood sours, highlights Hungary's vulnerabilities 
 * Lasting franc rise seen stretching borrowers' limits
 
 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, Aug 31 (Reuters) - A surge for the Swiss franc is
proving increasingly unbearable for Hungary's indebted
households, raising the risks to its financial position and the
chances of it being forced back to the IMF for help if market
falls worsen.
 Financial markets have so far been forgiving to Hungary,
which shocked investors in July when its talks with the
International Monetary Fund and EU collapsed and its government
said it would no longer need the IMF's safety net.
 But a fresh rise in risk aversion, which prompted investors
to pile money into safe haven currencies and drove the Swiss
franc to record highs against the euro, has put Hungary's
currency and government bonds under rising pressure this week.
 The country's key vulnerabilities -- a huge foreign currency
debt stock and poor economic growth prospects -- come under the
spotlight when investor sentiment sours. The global crisis in
2008 paralysed its bond market and drove the country to seek IMF
aid. This time the pressure point may be the franc.
 Franc loans make up about half of Hungary's household debt
stock and its rise means borrowers are being pushed to their
limits to meet payments, driving up non-performing loan rates.
 In July households' Swiss franc loan stock which includes
home and equity mortgages and car loans as well, totalled a
staggering 5.7 trillion forints. Households' NPLs in the banking
system rose to 8.1 percent in June from 7.3 percent in March.
 ""I think CHF/HUF is already at alarming levels, the main
question is how long it will stay here,"" said Kubilay Ozturk at
HSBC. ""It is very difficult to quantify how far we are from a
repetition of the October 2008 situation as some market
participants still seem to remain allured by the high-yield
offered by Hungarian bonds, but the external environment appears
increasingly hostile (or risk-averse), which does not augur well
in the absence of an IMF anchor.""
 On Tuesday the forint  hit lows past 222 to the
franc -- down 18 percent this year. Most households took their
loans prior to the 2008 crisis at levels of 140-160 forints,
meaning their payments have risen by around 30-40 percent.
 Bond yields jumped 25-30 basis points from Monday with the
5-year government bond trading at around 7.45 percent, a 6-week
high. The cost of insuring Hungary's debt against default rose
to its highest since mid-July.
 
 BUDGET WORRIES
 The centre-right cabinet has added fiscal uncertainty back
into the mix since it took power in May, with a lack of clarity
over its economic plans unlikely to be resolved before October
local elections.
 Economists suspect Fidesz will still return to the table
with the IMF eventually. Gyula Toth at Unicredit said the chance
of that happening before the October polls -- now less than 50
percent -- will likely depend on global markets which could put
local markets under pressure.
 ""If the U.S. stock market falls 10-15 pct as some people
fear and the Swiss central bank does not intervene (to stem the
franc's firming), we cannot rule out the emergence of a
situation in which Hungary is forced to turn to the IMF even
before the election,"" Toth said.
 The huge currency mismatch is a key risk for Hungary but to
pose a financial stability threat it would have to accelerate in
a lasting way.
 ""Obviously, it is bad and weakens the quality of portfolios
but I do not expect a dramatic deterioration because the
exchange rate is just one, albeit an important factor in FX
mortgages,"" said Zoltan Torok, economist at Raiffeisen.
 ""I would not think this weakening would herald a new trend
but I do not expect major firming (in the forint versus the
franc) either.""
 Earlier stress tests on Hungarian banks by the central bank
(NBH) showed in April that a forint level of 215 per franc could
require banks to increase capital by up to 50 billion forints, a
fraction of the total capital of 2.25 trillion forints available
in the sector. The tests assumed much weaker economic activity
and were made before Hungary's new government imposed a major
tax on the financial sector to plug budget holes.
 The bank now sees 0.9 percent GDP growth for this year.
 
 FORINT FACES BUMPY RIDE
 Even if there is no market crisis, the forint faces a bumpy
ride in the next few weeks and traders see further upside for
bond yields, although they say 8 percent has several times
proved strong resistance for 10-year bond yields this year.
 Eight percent is seen as a key technical level.
 Last month when Hungary's talks with lenders collapsed, two
ratings agencies signalled they might cut Hungary's sovereign
debt rating [ID:nLDE66M0U9]. But a Reuters poll last week showed
analysts deeply divided over whether Hungary would seek the
insurance of some form of IMF deal this year. [ID:nLDE67N1M7]
 ""At the moment we are seeing a slow seeping away of
sentiment towards Hungary as markets turn risk averse,"" said
Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura in London.
 ""If that were to be a sudden risk off and say a failed
auction or similar then a crisis could happen very quickly.
However under the present slow grind there is not enough
momentum to drive them back to IMF.""
 Fidesz is also resistant to coming forward with its 2011
budget plans before the Oct. 3 municipal elections -- the
party's main priority now. The question is whether events
externally may force it to take steps.
 ""This is a dangerous sort of game really,"" said David Oxley
at Capital Economics. ""Obviously a lot of pressure would come
off the forint if you could bring in the back stop of an IMF
programme. Again, Fidesz just don't seem willing to go down that
route.""

171,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2010 11:12AM ET</span>",Ukraine blocks nearly all grain exports -traders," KIEV, 31 Aug (Reuters) - Ukraine's Customs Service has
almost completely stopped grain exports and has strengthened its
recently imposed additional grain quality checks, traders said
on Tuesday.
 ""The situation has become even more difficult. Last week we
were able to ship some grain, but this week all shipments are
blocked in ports by customs,"" one Ukrainian trader told Reuters.
 He said his company could not get any explanation from
customs officials.
 ""We shipped one vessel last week after a serious delay, but
nothing so far this week,"" another trader said.
 The head office of Ukraine's Customs Service said, however,
there were no new orders and that the latest obstacles could be
a ""local initiative"".
 ""We have not issued any new orders,"" customs spokeswoman
Svetlana Sudak said.
 The wheat harvest in Ukraine could fall to about 17 million
tonnes in 2010 from 20.9 million in 2009 after severe frosts in
winter and a prolonged heat wave in July and August.
 Last week the deputy head of Ukraine's customs service,
Serhiy Semka, told Reuters the service would keep up quality
checks on all Ukrainian wheat export shipments, in spite of
unhappiness among traders, and might extend them to other
cereals.
 But Semka said the checks should not take more than five
days and that customs would not create any artificial bans on
exports.
 Ukraine Farm Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said on Tuesday
his ministry was not in charge of export shipments, but
supported free grain exports from the country.
 ""If a vessel cannot be sent, it means that the customs have
some questions. In this case the customs must check the issue,""
he told reporters.
 Ukraine's grain traders association UZA urged the government
on Tuesday to clarify the exports regime.
 ""If the government has decided not to introduce
restrictions, we urge it to remove all artificial barriers to
grain traders' work,"" it said in a statement.
 The government earlier this month proposed limiting exports
of wheat and barley to 2.5 million tonnes between September and
December but has put off the final decision until October.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen neared a 15-year high
against the dollar on Tuesday as investors shrugged off the
Bank of Japan's latest easing move, betting on yen gains that
would again test authorities' readiness to intervene.
 Mounting U.S. economic concerns are likely to keep
investors away from riskier assets and push up the safe-haven
yen. That could eventually prompt Japan to sell its currency in
the markets for the first time in more than six years.
 ""The policy action by the BoJ isn't going to change the
market's mood. It would probably take intervention to shake
things up a bit,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist
at Wells Fargo in New York. ""But we're not even sure that would
cause a sustained reversal of yen strength.""
 The dollar got a little support from data showing U.S.
consumer confidence rose modestly in August, lifted by a mild
improvement in the short-term outlook. See [ID:nN31236324]
 In mid-morning trading, the dollar was down 0.2 percent at
84.45 yen . It had earlier fallen to 84.06, according to
Reuters data, not far from its 15-year low of 83.58 set on
electronic trading platform EBS last week.
 ""We got a surprisingly nice number from consumer
confidence, given that sentiment has been so negative lately,""
said John Doyle, senior strategist at Tempus Consulting in
Washington.
 But he added that while the data paints a slightly rosier
picture for the U.S., the trend is still for softer growth.
Investors will scrutinize the minutes from the Federal
Reserve's most recent policy meeting due out later in the day
and jobs data on Friday for more clues about the economy, he
said.
 The euro rose 0.5 percent against the dollar to $1.2726
, helped in part by strong job numbers from Germany.
[ID:nLDE67U0IQ]
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on
Tuesday that the government would take decisive action on
currencies -- usually seen as code for intervention -- when
necessary. But the reaction in the market was limited.
 On Monday, the Bank of Japan expanded cheap loans to banks,
a move seen as a symbolic gesture that will do little to halt
the currency's climb.
 ""These measures seem more suited to dealing with the
negative economic effects of yen strength, rather than directly
addressing the currency, suggesting more than a little
hesitation in meeting the issue head-on at current dollar/yen
valuations,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto.
 The dollar has fallen 2.3 percent against the yen this
month and is down more than 9 percent this year.

 * H1 net income 16.6 bln tenge
 * Higher net fees, lower impairment charges
 * Higher H1 net than rival Kazkommertsbank

(Adds forecast, quotes)
 ALMATY, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Halyk Bank, Kazakhstan's No. 2
lender by assets, raised its 2010 net profit forecast on Tuesday
after its first-half income quadrupled thanks to lower bad loan
charges.
 Halyk, the country's most profitable bank, expects 2010 net
income to reach 32 billion to 33 billion tenge ($217-$224
million), more than double its profit last year, Deputy Chief
Executive Dauren Karabayev told a conference call.
 ""If in 2010 our earnings growth is more about low
provisioning charges, next year we expect that earnings will be
growing on the back of higher revenues -- more lending -- but
also recovery of NPLs,"" Karabayev said.
 Kazakhstan's banking sector, one of the first and hardest
hit by the global financial crisis, is recovering in tandem with
an improving economy. Gross domestic product grew 8 percent in
the first six months of 2010.
Halyk boosted net income to 16.6 billion tenge in the first
half of 2010, attributing its growth to a 51.8 percent fall in
its loan impairment charge, as well as an increase in net fees
and commission income and a decrease in interest expense.
 In terms of net income, the bank outperformed domestic rival
Kazkommertsbank, which on Friday reported a net first-half
profit of 10.2 billion tenge ($69 million).
 Halyk said its net interest income increased to 19.1 billion
tenge in the first six months of 2010 from a year-ago loss of
5.5 billion tenge.
 Net loans to customers fell 3.7 percent as loan repayments
exceeded new loans issued.
 Halyk halved its loan growth target from the 10 percent
forecast at the end of the first quarter.
 ""We expect loan growth to be around 5 percent for 2010,""
said Karabayev. ""But we expect that the corporate segment will
grow faster, by approximately 7 percent.""
 Halyk posted net income of 15.9 billion tenge in 2009, which
despite the financial crisis was 9 percent higher than the
previous year, propped up by fees and commissions.

 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen rose toward a 15-year
high against the dollar on Tuesday as investors shrugged off

 ""But we're not even sure that would cause a sustained

by itself did not cause an immediate turnaround in the yen,"" he
added.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on

currencies -- usually seen as code for intervention -- when
necessary. But the reaction in the market was limited.
 On Monday, the BOJ expanded cheap loans to banks, a move
seen as a symbolic gesture that will do little to halt the
currency's climb.
 Traders said the policy response to the yen's strength has
been insufficient given the current sentiment and lack of
appetite for a coordinated policy response from other Group of
8 rich nations, who are grappling with their own problems.
 ""These measures seem more suited to dealing with the
negative economic effects of yen strength, rather than directly
addressing the currency, suggesting more than a little

this month and is down more than 9 percent this year.
 Traders say Japanese authorities are expected to buy the
dollar against the yen if the dollar slides 3-4 yen in one

 CARRY TRADE UNWINDING
 The dollar/yen rate has had a strong correlation in recent
months with the yield gap between the United States and Japan.
So a fall in Treasury yields also weighed on the dollar.
 A raft of U.S. economic releases this week could push the
yen higher. On top of jobs data on Friday, there is consumer
confidence data on Tuesday and manufacturing data on
Wednesday.
 Minutes from the Federal Reserve's last board meeting will
be released on Tuesday and investors will get insight into
divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee and its
August 10 decision to buy longer-term Treasury securities.
 The yen could also face potential buyback pressure in cross
trades such as euro/yen and Aussie/yen, which have attracted
some interest because of their larger yield differentials.
 Simon Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said the collapse
of one of New Zealand's largest finance companies was leading
to some carry trade unwinding and was hurting high-yielding
currencies like the Australian dollar against the yen.
 Against the dollar, the euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.2731,
helped in part by strong job numbers from Germany.

 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - European fund managers cut their
equity holdings to their lowest level in a year this month while
they lifted bonds and cash allocation as uncertainty grew over
the global economic outlook, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
 The poll of 16 Europe-based asset management firms outside
of Britain showed a typical mixed portfolio holding 45.1 percent
in equities this month, its lowest since August 2009, from 46.8
percent in July.
 They held 41.2 percent in bonds -- including government and
corporate debt -- in August, compared with 40.6 percent last
month.
 Cash holdings stood at 6.9 percent, compared with 6.7
percent last month, off a one-year high of 8.0 percent in May.
 The poll was taken between Aug 17 and 27, when world stocks
hit a seven-week low as jitters grew the U.S. economy could be
slowing to an extent that it would force the Federal Reserve to
embark on unconventional easing policy.
 ""To us, the most important risk to our portfolio is the
macroeconomic slowdown,"" Jean-Yves Dumont, head of asset
allocation strategy at Dexia Asset Management in Brussels.
 ""We do not believe in a scenario of a double-dip but we
cannot exclude this scenario as a shock of confidence (where)
consumers stop spending and corporates stop investing is always
possible and could be caused by policy mistakes.""
 Investors allocated 30.6 percent of their equity investments
into the United States and Canada, down from 31.5 percent last
month. Euro zone equity holdings rose to 44.4 percent from 42.9
percent.
 Within equities, investors were underweight financials,
while they liked industrials.
 In fixed income, respondents allocated 68.1 percent to the
euro zone, down from 71.9 percent last month. 
 Overall, they held 60 percent in government securities, 25
percent in investment grade corporate paper and 6.9 percent in
high-yield bonds.
 Respondents were most underweight in Japanese government
bonds, while they overweighted corporate bonds -- maintaining
the trend seen in the past few months.
 Overall, investors were most overweight on cash and most
underweight in bonds, while they also became underweight stocks
for the first time this year.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2010 09:04AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-Top credit favoured by cautious investors-Reuters poll," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Leading investors around the
world barely changed their exposure to assets in August,
trimming equities slightly in favour of bonds, where they loaded
up on top-notch corporates, Reuters polls showed on Tuesday.
 The surveys of 54 top investment houses in the United
States, Britain, Europe ex UK and Japan showed a shift in
different regions of the world.
 U.S. and European investors cut back on equities, while
British and Japanese investors increased their exposure.
 But the overall tone was one of continued caution.
 Concern was expressed about the slowing U.S. economy and the
danger of it slipping back into recession.
 ""Uncertainty about the U.S. economic outlook has
intensified,"" said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist at
Daiwa Asset Management.
 ""If the U.S. economy actually slows down then this would
affect Europe and would also make it difficult for emerging
economies to maintain their high growth,"" he said.
 Equity holdings fell to 50.4 percent of a mixed asset
portfolio in the month from July's 50.6 percent, although
investors said their stance remained mildly overweight. Bonds
rose to 36.3 percent from 36.0 percent and cash was unchanged at
a relatively high 5.8 percent.
 One key finding was the continued move by investors into
investment grade credit.
 The polls showed 27.4 percent of a bond portfolio now held
investment grade corporate debt, up from 22.6 percent a month
earlier. Exposure to other categories of bonds slipped.
 Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life
Investments, said the August move probably reflected a search
for yields as government bonds are now offering so little. But
he said his firm has long been a fan.
 ""In a world of low interest rates, low inflation and
uncertainty about the future of corporate earnings, we have
focused on the secure returns of investment grade,"" he said.
 
 REGIONALLY
 U.S. fund managers cut their exposure to equities in August
and raised their bond allocations.
 The survey of 14 U.S.-based fund management firms found an
average of 61.5 percent of assets held in equities, compared
with 65.0 percent a month earlier.
 Exposure to bonds, rose to 31.8 percent in August from 29.8
percent in July. Cash allocations moved to 3.1 percent in
August, from 2.0 percent in July.
 European fund managers cut their equity holdings to their
lowest level in a year and lifted bonds and cash.
 The poll of 16 Europe-based asset management firms outside
of Britain showed 45.1 percent in equities, down from 46.8
percent in July. They held 41.2 percent in bonds compared with
40.6 percent last month. Cash holdings stood at 6.9 percent,
compared with 6.7 percent last month.
 The survey of 11 British fund managers showed the average
exposure to equities jumped more than 3 percentage points from a
month earlier.
 The average allocation to equities climbed to 49.8 percent
in August, compared with 46.4 percent in July. Allocations to
bonds fell to 24.2 percent from 25.5 percent.
 The effect was exaggerated by a change in the sample, but
the trend was the same on a like-for-like basis.
 Japanese fund managers raised their weighting for equities
to a four-month high in August and cut their weighting for bonds
for a second straight month to the lowest since March.
 The 13 fund management companies in the poll raised their
average allocation for equities to 45.2 percent in August from
44.2 percent in July. The bonds weighting dropped to 47.9
percent from 48.2 percent the previous month.
 A fifth poll of Chinese fund managers, not included in the
the global survey, showed an increase in the recommendation for
stock exposure to a five-month high.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen came within reach of a
15-year high against the dollar on Tuesday as investors shrugged
off the Bank of Japan's latest policy easing, betting instead on
more yen gains that would test official readiness to intervene.
 With mounting U.S. economic worries likely to keep investors
away from riskier assets such as stocks and high-yielding
currencies, the market may push up the low-yielding yen. 
 That could eventually prompt Japan to sell its currency in
the markets for the first time in more than six years.
 ""Japan's ministry of finance is sending signals that it is
willing to intervene but clearly people remember its struggle
with intervention a few years ago,"" said Simon Derrick, head of
currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""If they don't intervene when the yen is at 84, when will
they do it? Once it goes to all-time lows? I think their resolve
... will be tested.""
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on Tuesday
that the government would take decisive action on currencies --
usually seen as code for intervention -- when necessary. But the
reaction in the market was limited.
 On Monday, the BOJ boosted a cheap loan scheme to banks, in
a move that was probably the least it could do for now.
 But traders said the policy response to the yen's strength
has been insufficient given the current sentiment and lack of
appetite for a co-ordinated policy response from other G8
nations, who are grappling with their own problems.
 At 1117 GMT the dollar was down 0.3 percent at 84.32 yen
after falling to 84.06, not far from its 15-year low of 83.58
hit last week. The greenback has fallen more than 2.5 percent
against the Japanese currency this month after sliding 2.2
percent in July.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent on the day at 106.90 yen, off
an earlier low of 106.19 and up from a nine-year low of 105.44
yen hit last week. Traders said the euro was being underpinned
by month-end demand.
 Traders say Japanese authorities are expected to buy the
dollar against the yen to curb the yen's strength if the dollar
slides 3-4 yen in one day. For Q+A on will Japan intervene to
curb the yen's rise, click on.
 ""There is a tug-of-war that is taking place between Japan's
Ministry of Finance and the BOJ and the markets are aware of
that,"" said a currency strategist at a Japanese bank in London.
""Even if they decide to intervene, the dollar's topside will be
capped with option strikes at 86-87 yen levels.""
 Analysts said a raft of U.S. economic data due this week
could also push the yen higher. On top of closely watched jobs
numbers on Friday, there is housing price data on Tuesday and
manufacturing data on Wednesday.
 Minutes from the Federal Reserve's last board meeting will
be released on Tuesday and investors will get further insight
into divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee and its
August 10 decision to buy longer-term Treasury securities.
 CARRY TRADE UNWINDING
 The dollar/yen rate has had a strong correlation in recent
months with the yield gap between the United States and Japan.
So a fall in Treasury yields also weighed on the dollar.
 In addition, the yen could face potential buyback pressure
in cross trades such as euro/yen and Aussie/yen, which have
attracted some interest because of their larger yield
differentials.
 Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said the collapse of one
of New Zealand's largest finance companies was leading to some
carry trade unwinding and was hurting high-yielding currencies
like the Australian dollar against the yen.
 In another sign of investor risk aversion, the euro slumped
to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc, removing
barriers at 1.2900 on the way lower. The euro fell as low as
1.2898 francs on trading platform EBS.
 Against the dollar, the euro was marginally higher at
$1.2680, helped in part by strong job numbers from Germany.. The
dollar also fell to a seven-month low of 1.0173 francs.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday in
markets dominated by concerns the U.S. economy is sliding back
into recession, prompting further flows into safe-haven assets.
 The yen - favoured for carry trades at times of economic
stress - hovered back near 15-year high against the dollar after
investors brushed off Japan's attempt to weaken the currency,
the Swiss franc soared against the euro and dollar, and yields
on benchmark German government bonds hit record lows.
 Mounting U.S. economic concerns are likely to draw investors
away from riskier assets and push up the yen, keeping pressure
on Japan to intervene directly in currency markets for the first
time in more than six years.
Crude prices, seen as a proxy for world economic growth,
also came under pressure, extending losses so far in August to
6.5 percent and staying on track for their biggest monthly
decline since May.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
lost 0.7 percent. The index is down 4.1 percent in August and
was headed towards its worst monthly performance in three
months.
 Tokyo's Nikkei average shed 3.6 percent, its worst daily
drop in three months, after the Bank of Japan's move the day
before to boost cheap loans to commercial banks failed to curb
the yen's strength.
 U.S. stock index futures eased 0.3 to 0.4 percent,
indicating a weaker start for Wall Street ahead of the minutes
of the Federal Reserve's last meeting on Aug. 10. On Monday,
U.S. shares fell 1.4 to 1.6 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 1 percent and
the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Countries Index fell 0.7
percent.
 ""We've have had a string of weak numbers, and now even
second-tier economic data can have a big impact on the market,""
said Joost Van Leenders, investment specialist allocation and
strategy at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in Amsterdam.
 ""We're still 'underweight' equities because of the economic
outlook. We've been expecting a slowdown in the second half of
the year with the boom from inventories and stimulus spending
fading, and it has actually been a bit worse than we had
anticipated.""
 The VDAX-NEW volatility index, Europe's main barometer of
investor anxiety, rose 2.7 percent. The higher the volatility
index, the lower investors' appetite for risk.
 
 YEN NEAR 15-YR HIGH
 The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 84.42 yen, not far from
its 15-year low of 83.58 hit last week. The U.S. currency fell
2.4 percent against the Japanese currency this month after
sliding 2.2 percent in July.
 ""Japan's ministry of finance is sending signals that is
willing to intervene but clearly people remember its struggle
with intervention a few years ago,"" said Simon Derrick, head of

 ""If they don't intervene when the yen is at 84, when will

resolve of staying away from intervention will be tested.""
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on Tuesday
that the government would take decisive action on currencies --
usually seen as code for intervention -- when necessary, but
reaction in the market was limited. The yen has gained more than
9 percent versus the greenback so far this year.
 The euro fell to an all-time low against the Swiss franc,
which also hovered close to a seven-month high against the
dollar.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year German Bunds hit record lows at
2.085 percent, while those on 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped 2
basis points to 2.5108 percent, hovering near 18-month low.
 In the commodity market, oil lost 1.3 percent to trade below
$74 a barrel, while copper dropped 0.7 percent but was still up
1.5 percent this month.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2010 06:44AM ET</span>",SNAP ANALYSIS-S.Africa's Zuma tries to dodge bullet on strike," By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 31 (Reuters) - South Africa's government
has made a new wage offer to striking state workers to end a
labour dispute that has raised investor concerns over Africa's
largest economy.
 The strike added to tensions between President Jacob Zuma's
ruling African National Congress and the country's largest
labour federation COSATU, which has a long-standing governing
alliance with Africa's oldest political party.
 The following are some implications of how the new wage
offer will impact the strike and what a settlement would mean
for Zuma's government:
 POLITICAL PRESSURES
 Zuma will be given a measure of credit in the short term for
acting quickly after he returned last week from a trip to China
and then ordered his ministers to try to negotiate a settlement.
 If the offer leads to a settlement, unions will likely cool
rhetoric about the alliance being on the verge of rupture. But
they will still keep up pressure on Zuma to push their agenda of
left-leaning policies that include a call to weaken the rand.
 Zuma's enemies in the ANC will still be gunning for him at a
major policy setting meeting later in September and will blame
him for letting the strike last as long as it did.
 Zuma, seeking allies, may reach out to anti-union factions
at the ANC meeting. Cosatu has called for major revisions to a
government programme to expand economic empowerment to the black
majority, saying it has benefitted the politically connected,
while leading to cronyism and corruption. Analysts said there
are groups in the ANC who would like to crack down on the unions
to try to free up a rigid labour market seen as worrying
investors. But there are some who joined the anti-union group
out of their own self-interest to keep their slice of the
empowerment programmes, analysts said.
 
 REJECTED OFFER
 If the unions reject the offer, Zuma could face one of the
biggest crises of his term with a massive strike looming, more
threats to the alliance and his foes looking to seize as much
power from him as possible. That could leave him far weaker with
most of his five-year term still ahead.
 The government could try to impose its wage offer
unilaterally to end the impasse, but this would further strain
ties with labour. It could also quickly improve its wage offer
to limit the damage.
 Zuma and the ANC would find themselves in a weaker position
heading into local elections early next year that would embolden
the opposition. But its virtual one-party rule would not be in
jeopardy.
 
 BUDGET PRESSURES
 If accepted, the government's latest proposal will likely
swell state spending by an amount equal to about 1 to 2 percent
of the overall budget. That will force the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 There are worries that the deal could lead to higher taxes
or cause South Africa to increase its borrowing, making it more
costly to obtain loans and leading to increased budget spending
to pay for servicing the debt.
 This could lead to a downgrade of its sovereign rating.
 
 PUBLIC OPINION
 The public appears to be angry at the unions for cutting off
services and their violent conduct during a strike which has led
to the sick being denied treatment at hospitals. It is also
angry at the government for letting the situation get out of
hand. But their anger will not likely lead to any changes in how
labour disputes are fought and settled.

 * Shareholders still at odds after meeting Putin
 * Putin calls for rethink of nickel, copper duties

(Combines RUSAL earnings with Norilsk conflict)
 By Darya Korsunskaya
 NORILSK, Russia, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin backed Norilsk Nickel shareholder Vladimir
Potanin on Tuesday in his bid to stop co-owner Oleg Deripaska
securing bigger dividend payouts from the company.
 The world's largest producer of nickel and palladium is at
the centre of a tug of war over its revenue stream since tycoon
Deripaska's interests bought a 25 percent stake in Norilsk,
putting him on equal footing with long-time owner Potanin.
 The stake is held by Deripaska's other big investment
holding, debt-laden company UC RUSAL, the world's top aluminium
producer. It wants Norilsk to pay 110 percent of its net profit,
or some $3 billion, in dividends for 2009.
 On Tuesday, the board approved a payout of far less -- 50
percent of net profit -- but Putin noted that this still
compares with 17 and 38 percent respectively for western
heavyweight companies Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.
""In Norilsk they (dividends) are the biggest. I think this
is enough,"" Putin told Norilsk workers.
 ""They (Potanin and Deripaska) are arguing over how much to
pay out in dividends. Although it may sound strange the argument
may in the end be healthy for the company because an optimal
path of development is being worked out,"" Putin said.
 Norilsk, one of the most lucrative enterprises privatised in
controversial state auctions in the 1990s, has often been seen
as a target for renationalisation.
 RUSAL, which also reported a $1.27 billion net profit for
the first half of the year on Tuesday, booked $450 million from
the rise in value of its Norilsk stake.
 ""Our shareholding in Norilsk Nickel continues to deliver
value for UC RUSAL,"" RUSAL head of corporate strategy Maxim
Sokov told a conference call.
 RUSAL is Russia's most indebted company with more than $12
billion on its balance sheet. It reached a restructuring deal
last year that served as a landmark for Russia, with corporate
and bank debt totalling $430.6 billion on April 1, according to
the central bank.
 
 MOVEMENT FORWARD
 Putin said the state and the firm should share the cost of
investing 27 billion roubles ($874 million) in the development
of Norilsk, an Arctic town of 135,000 which is suffering from
heavy pollution and whose population is shrinking.
 ""We have seen that the money is there,"" Putin said. 
 For its part, the government has so far avoided bleeding
Norilsk through export duties since the global financial crisis
precipitated an economic slump that sapped metals prices.
 But Putin called for a review of export duties for nickel
and copper to link them better to global prices for the metals,
creating a duty formula similar to the one used for oil exports.
 ""There is an idea to create a flexible formula, like in the
oil industry, so that the fiscal burden fluctuates together with
global prices for nickel and copper,"" Putin said.
 Putin, whose visit to the mining giant was postponed from a
visit initially scheduled for last week, said the warring
tycoons had moved forward to resolve the dispute. 
 ""It is good I could not come a week ago. During this time
shareholders, management and the government have been working on
the company's problems, and it seems to me there is some
movement forward,"" Putin said. 
 The two tycoons emerged still at odds with each other after
the meeting with Putin and the renewed war of words showed their
dispute has not been settled after the prime minister's visit.
""Our colleagues who have their own problems should
concentrate on solving them before advising others,"" Potanin
told reporters. ""RUSAL ... has yet to prove it can recover."" 
 Deripaska said he was still in talks with holders of
Norilsk's foreign listed shares, who control 3O percent of the
company, about forming a majority of independent directors in
the Norilsk board that will be able to outvote Potanin. 
 Norilsk CEO Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, seen as a close Putin
ally parachuted in to ensure smooth operations regardless of the
ownership structure, sounded a harsh note on RUSAL. 
 ""RUSAL is the leader among losers. Everything we hear from
him (Deripaska), we hear from a person who had failed in his
business,"" Strzhalkovsky told reporters.

 * Vows to take decisive steps if needed vs rapid yen rise
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The Japanese deputy finance
minister on Tuesday said he would want the Bank of Japan to leave
extra yen in the market if the government conducts forex
intervention to stem a rise in the currency that is threatening
the country's export-reliant economy.
 If Japan were to step in to stem yen gains, the BOJ might
decide not to drain the yen it sold, some traders said. This
""unsterilised"" intervention would leave extra yen in the market,
effectively a form of monetary easing.
 Motohisa Ikeda echoed their view, saying that it would be
more effective to have unsterilised than sterilised intervention.
 ""We undoubtedly won't rule out using our authority,"" Ikeda
said, signalling the possibility of currency intervention.
 He was speaking at a conference attended by lawmakers and
economists, as a guest speaker but not as a government
representative.
 ""Currency intervention is the prerogative of the Ministry of
Finance and the BOJ is its agent ... It would be no good if the
BOJ absorbs money from the market in such a case and I'd want the
BOJ to carry out unsterilised (intervention).""
 He also said the central bank should not rule out cutting its
policy rate to zero percent from the current 0.1 percent in case
unsterilised intervention is carried out.
 Ikeda added that the ""secret of success"" for Japan's
intervention in the past was the BOJ's cooperation in
unsterilised intervention and consent from other countries.
 But it is now difficult to gain support from other nations,
which Ikeda said appear to be letting their currencies weaken.
 He added that Tokyo is ready to take decisive steps on
currencies when necessary to prevent a rapid rise in the yen,
which is hovering near a 15-year high against the dollar despite
central bank easing and efforts by the government to talk down
the currency.
 The BOJ boosted a cheap loan scheme on Monday, bowing to
government pressure for action to protect a fragile recovery by
curbing the yen's rise. But that failed to scare investors from
betting on it climbing further.
 Ikeda said he appreciated that the BOJ eased policy in line
with the government's efforts to beat deflation.
 But in the long term, he said the central bank should adopt a
rigid inflation target, rather than the reference rate it
currently has.
 Japan has not intervened in the currency market since March
2004, when a 15-month yen-selling spree came to an end. It sold
35 trillion yen ($414 billion) in that period.

 * China will consult with EU about subsidy investigation
 * EU has until mid-Sept to launch an investigation
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The European Union is preparing
to investigate whether China is unfairly subsidising makers of
wireless modems, the latest move by Europe to defend its
high-tech industry in the face of China's growing market share.
 The European Commission, the EU's executive, has told member
states it wants to investigate the sector and has until
mid-September to launch a full study, diplomats say. Such a move
would add pressure to already tense EU-China trade relations.
 The Commission's desire to investigate follows a complaint
by Option, Europe's sole producer of the wireless Internet
devices and a supplier of modems to telecoms giants such as
Vodafone and Telefonica.
 According to Option's complaint, seen by Reuters, China's
modem producers receive direct government grants, cheap loans
and state-backed R&D as part of China's efforts to shift from a
major low-tech exporter into a top player in global telecoms.
 ""China's government policies are aimed at raising up and
supporting domestic companies in the telecommunication and
information technology sectors with the express purpose of
making them global champions,"" the complaint says.
 China exported about 25 million wireless modems -- used to
access the Internet on laptops and handhelds -- worth around
1.25 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in 2009. Its exports made up
90 percent of European modem imports, according to EU estimates.
 The Commission has until mid-September to start a 13-month
investigation, which could lead to steep import tariffs valid
for five years. EU capitals must this week oppose or tacitly
approve the Commission plan, according people close to the case.
 Tariff hikes and a possible import limit on Chinese modems
resulting from the investigation could hurt China's two leading
producers, Huawei Technologies and ZTE.
 EU member states have in the past given their backing to
subsidy complaints, but one EU diplomat said the Chinese
subsidies targeted in this complaint could be legal.
 
 TRADE ASSAULT
 If opened, the investigation would represent the first time
the EU has rolled out three trade defence instruments at once
against one of its trading partners and highlights the EU's
willingness to face down exporting powerhouse China, its biggest
trade partner after the United States.
 In June, the EU started a dual investigation into alleged
market dumping by Chinese wireless modem exporters and into
whether the EU should resort to emergency safeguards to protect
Option from sudden surges in Chinese imports.
 A Chinese official in Brussels said China will consult with
the EU on the investigation. China's Ministry of Commerce
lambasted the June investigations as trade protectionism.
 People familiar with the case say Beijing will point to
Option's production facilities in China and allege Commission
bias to discredit the claim.

 * Metals duty excluded from 2011 budget plan
 * Personal income tax to rise for high earners
 * 2010 GDP growth f'cast seen revised to 5 percent
 
 (Recasts with export duties, revised GDP, analyst comment)
 By Raushan Nurshayeva
 ASTANA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan will double its crude
oil export duty next year and raise taxes on high earners, the
finance minister said on Tuesday, while indicating miners may
escape the Central Asian state's drive to swell its coffers.
 Oil firms operating in Central Asia's largest economy must
pay $40 to the state for every tonne of crude exported from Jan.
1, a move that will hurt earnings as Kazakhstan asserts control
over foreign investors after a recovery in global oil prices.
""The most substantial contribution to budget revenues (in
2011) is forecast from an increase in the export duty on oil
from $20 to $40 per tonne,"" Finance Minister Bolat Zhamishev
told a government meeting.
 He later told reporters, however, that an export duty on
metals proposed by government officials from 2011 was not part
of the planning for next year's budget.
 ""No, this has not been provided for,"" the minister said in a
response to a question on the metals export duty. He stopped
short of saying a proposed levy had been abandoned altogether.
 Kazakhstan's economy, the largest in Central Asia, has grown
by an average 9 percent a year over the last decade, largely due
to exports of oil and metals. The country is the world's largest
uranium miner and a major producer of copper, chrome and zinc.
 It abolished an export duty on oil in January 2009 to help
producers ride out low crude prices during the global financial
crisis. Even at $40 per tonne, the duty is only a fifth of the
level applied before the tax was scrapped.
 But analysts have compared the reintroduction of the duty to
efforts by Russia and other resource-rich nations to become more
assertive with investors as oil prices recover.
 At just below $74 a barrel, U.S. crude is about 60 percent
more expensive than it was when the duty was scrapped.
 Zhamishev said Kazakhstan would earn about $2.9 billion from
the oil export tax next year.
 He said Tengizchevroil, the Chevron-led consortium that is
Kazakhstan's biggest oil producer, was paying the export duty
and that any firm operating under a production sharing agreement
was obliged to contribute.
 Other producers will also be affected. Troika Dialog
brokerage cut its 2011 net income forecast for London-traded
KazMunaiGas Exploration & Production by 6 percent.
 ""The move adds another layer of uncertainty for investors
who are trying to model Kazakh oil companies' earnings,"" Troika
analysts said in a note.
 
 HIGHER TAXES, GDP
 Zhamishev said he forecast Kazakhstan's 2011 budget deficit
at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with an
estimated 4.1 percent this year.
 Budget revenues were set to rise by 20 percent next year,
the minister said, to about 4.1 trillion tenge ($27.5 billion).
 Zhamishev also said the government planned to raise personal
income tax from a flat 10 percent. Those earning between 250,000
and 500,000 tenge ($1,700-$3,400) per month would be subject to
a 15 percent rate, and those above 500,000 tenge to 20 percent.
Zhamishev said he expected Kazakhstan to revise its GDP
growth forecast for 2010 upward to 5.0 percent, from the current
official forecast of 4.0 percent. The economy grew 8.0 percent
in the first six months of 2010. At 3.1 percent, economic
growth would be slower next year than this, Economy Minister
Zhanar Aitzhanova told the meeting, before picking up again to
3.3 percent in 2012 and 3.5 percent in 2013. In 2009,
Kazakhstan's economy grew 1.2 percent.
 ""The completion of industrial projects and an increase in
demand for the products that Kazakhstan exports will facilitate
industrial production growth of 3.6 percent in 2011 and 3.9
percent in 2012 and 2013,"" Aitzhanova said.
 She also forecast inflation next year would stay within the
corridor of 6.0 percent to 8.0 percent estimated in 2010.
 Kazakhstan's latest macroeconomic forecasts were based on an
average crude oil price of $65 per barrel between 2011 and 2015.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen nudged back towards a
15-year high against the dollar on Tuesday as investors shrugged
off the Bank of Japan's latest policy easing, betting instead on
more yen gains that would test official readiness to intervene.
 With mounting U.S. economic worries likely to keep investors
away from riskier assets such as stocks and high-yielding
currencies, the market is likely to push up the low-yielding
yen. That could eventually prompt Japan to sell its currency in
the markets for the first time in more than six years.
 ""Japan's ministry of finance is sending signals that it is
willing to intervene but clearly people remember its struggle
with intervention a few years ago,"" said Simon Derrick, head of
currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""If they don't intervene when the yen is at 84, when will
they do it? Once it goes to all-time lows? I think their resolve
... will be tested.""
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on Tuesday
that the government would take decisive action on currencies --
usually seen as code for intervention -- when necessary. But the
reaction in the market was limited.
 On Monday, the BOJ boosted a cheap loan scheme to banks, in
a move that was probably the least it could do for now. 
 But traders said the policy response to the yen's strength
has been insufficient given the current sentiment and lack of
appetite for a co-ordinated policy response from other G8
nations, who are grappling with their own problems.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 84.27 yen, not far from
its 15-year low of 83.58 hit last week. The greenback has fallen
over 2.5 percent against the Japanese currency this month after
sliding 2.2 percent in July.
 The euro also fell 0.2 percent against the yen to 106.91 yen, off a nine-year low of 105.44 yen hit last week.
 Traders say Japanese authorities are expected to buy the
dollar against the yen to curb the yen's strength if the dollar
slides 3-4 yen in one day. For Q+A on will Japan intervene to
curb the yen's rise, click on.
 ""There is a tug-of-war that is taking place between Japan's
Ministry of Finance and the BOJ and the markets are aware of
that,"" said a currency strategist at a Japanese bank in London.
""Even if they decide to intervene, the dollar's topside will be
capped with option strikes at 86-87 yen levels.""
 Analysts said a raft of U.S. economic data due this week
could also push the yen higher. On top of closely watched jobs
numbers on Friday, there is housing price data on Tuesday and
manufacturing data on Wednesday.
 Minutes from the Federal Reserve's last board meeting will
be released on Tuesday and investors will get further insight
into divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee and its
August 10 decision to buy longer-term Treasury securities.
 
 CARRY TRADE UNWINDING
 The dollar/yen rate has had a strong correlation in recent
months with the yield gap between the United States and Japan.
So a fall in Treasury yields also weighed on the dollar.
 In addition, the yen could face potential buyback pressure
in cross trades such as euro/yen and Aussie/yen, which have
attracted some interest because of their larger yield
differentials.
 Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon said the collapse of one
of New Zealand's largest finance companies was leading to some
carry trade unwinding and was hurting high-yielding currencies
like the Australian dollar against the yen..
 ""Many stop-losses for Japanese margin traders are expected
to be triggered when the Australian dollar falls below 75 yen,""
said a trader at a Japanese brokerage in Tokyo.
 In another sign of investor risk aversion, the euro slumped
to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc, removing
barriers at 1.2900 on the way lower. The euro fell as low as
1.2898 francs on trading platform EBS.
 Against the dollar, the euro was marginally higher at
$1.2682, helped in part by strong job numbers from Germany. The
dollar also fell to a seven-month low of 1.0173 francs.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2010 06:04AM ET</span>",UPDATE 4-Striking S.African workers vote on new wage offer," * Government increases offer to 7.5 percent
 * Major union leans towards rejecting, another is split

(Adds union comment, details)
 By Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Striking South African
state workers began voting on Tuesday on whether to accept an
improved government wage offer and end a strike that has lasted
nearly three weeks and raised pressure on President Jacob Zuma.
 On Monday, the government sweetened its offer for a wage
increase to 7.5 percent from 7 percent after being ordered back
to the negotiating table by Zuma.
 The new offer falls short of union demands for an 8.6
percent raise, but analysts said it improved prospects for
ending a strike which has closed schools, hit care at hospitals
and hurt investor sentiment towards Africa's biggest economy.
 Because workers across the country must be consulted and
their votes counted, a final decision on the offer is likely to
come on Wednesday at the earliest, union officials said.
 Ahead of the final tally, teachers' union SADTU, the largest
union in the coalition of more than a dozen groups representing
1.3 million state workers, said its members were likely to
reject the new offer.
 ""The general view is that the offer is being rejected,""
SADTU president Thobile Ntola told Reuters.
 Because of its weight in the country's biggest labour
federation COSATU, SADTU has the power to influence other unions
to reject the offer.
 The Independent Labour Caucus, another labour federation,
said its more than 200,000 workers appeared to be evenly split
on whether to approve the new offer.
 ""Some of the union leaders have indicated to the workers
that this is an offer that can be considered favourably,"" ILC
senior official Chris Klopper said.
 On top of the proposed wage increase, the government raised
its offer for a monthly housing allowance to 800 rand ($109),
still short of union demands for 1,000 rand.
 The revised housing allowance offer alone would add nearly 5
billion rand to state spending and the entire deal would add
about 1 to 2 percent to total budget expenditure.
 Fikile Majola of COSATU affiliated union NEHAWU expressed
doubts about whether the government would be in a position to
increase its offer further.
 ""Ultimately it's up to our members, but we have urged them
to look at the package offered,"" Majola said.
 
 WAGE BILL
 In 2006/07, about 35 percent of tax revenue went towards
paying state employees. That rose to about 47 percent in
2009/10.
 Rank and file members, feeling the pinch from lost wages
coming from the government's policy of ""no work, no pay"" for
strikers, may want to end the dispute, analysts said.
 But others are willing to overlook the damage to their
finances, feeling they have risked so much already that waiting
for a better offer is worth a few more days off the job.
 Although the strike's impact on the rand, South African
bonds and the stock market has been minimal so far, that could
change if the strike continues and spreads to the broader
economy.
 COSATU has threatened a one-day sympathy strike by all of
its members on Thursday if no deal is reached. Nearly 2 million
members of affiliated unions could disrupt industries such as
mining, manufacturing and communications. 
 South Africa is the world's fourth largest gold producer and
largest platinum producer. The country's biggest firms, such as
Anglo Platinum, Impala Platinum and Harmony Gold Mining, have
stockpiles of the precious metal and would not be hard hit by a
one-day work stoppage.
 In other disputes, a major South African union said it would
delay expanding strikes at a Rio Tinto-BHP Billiton titanium
joint venture and at Exxaro to enable the companies to raise pay
offers.
 Meanwhile, petrol station attendants, mechanics and other
auto sector workers plan to walk off the job from Wednesday,
seeking double digit wage increases,

 By Lorraine Turner and Myles Neligan
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - London-listed property and
casualty insurer Omega Insurance sank into the red in the first
half of the year, weighed down by a string of costly natural
disasters including the Chilean earthquake.
 ""These catastrophe losses, together with the lag that
currently exists in 2010 premium earnings, have had a major
effect on our half-year results,"" Chief Executive Richard Pexton
said on Tuesday.
 The outlook for the second half depends very much on the
level of hurricane activity, with Omega likely to suffer in the
event of a large natural disaster even as some insurers benefit.
 ""In the absence of a significant catastrophe, we would
expect to break even at the end of the year, if there is a very
large cat, that will be a struggle,"" he added.
 Omega swung to a pretax loss of $34.2 million in the six
months to June 30 from a profit of $22.9 million a year earlier,
in line with its profit warning this month indicating it was on
course for a loss of $35 million.
 Omega blamed a high level of claims stemming from
catastrophes including the Chilean quake, the BP oil spill in
the Gulf of Mexico and hailstorms in western Australia.
 But the insurer said it remained confident of its future
prospects and held its interim dividend at 6 cents per share.
 It said that the time lag on premium flows, which dented
first-half profits, will even out in the second half.
 The company's board has undergone a radical overhaul amid
shareholder activism, with new management appointed this year
after it lost one of its most senior underwriters last year.
 Pexton said that the new management's strategy will be
conservative given current market conditions. 
 ""The position of the company is going to be reasonably
defensive, we don't see this as the time to be growing the
business because the market isn't as strong as it might be,"" he
said. 
 Shares in Omega were flat at 90.5 pence at 0840 GMT, after
slumping to a record low of 85 pence this month, losing a fifth
of their value so far this year.

(Adds analyst comments)
 By Walter Gibbs and Richard Solem
 OSLO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Norway's Seadrill Ltd, the world's
number two deepwater oil rig group, is ready to throw its weight
around now that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has made life
harder for smaller players.
 ""We see the current market volatility as a good opportunity
to look for investment opportunities,"" the group controlled by
shipping tycoon John Fredriksen said on Tuesday while reporting
forecast-beating quarterly results.
 Seadrill said the world's worst offshore oil spill from
British oil major BP's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico
increased the emphasis on operational experience, making it more
challenging for new rig operators.
 ""The board is of the opinion that this could open up for
further consolidation of the ultra-deepwater rig market,""
Seadrill said.
 The offshore oil drilling sector has long been seen as ripe
for takeovers, and conditions created by the oil spill should
accelerate deals.
 Most drillers smaller than the U.S. ""big three"" --
Transocean Ltd, Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc and Noble Corp --
could be targets, investment bankers say.
 Ingolf Gillesdal, an analyst at Nordea Markets, said
Seadrill is better suited than most to weather the market
setback from April's deepwater blowout in the Gulf.
 ""They should be better positioned now within the segment
than before the spill because of their newer equipment and
size,"" he said.
 ""They have an average fleet age of four to five years,
versus 18 to 20 years by the competition,"" said Gillesdal,
referring to competitors such as Transocean and Pride.
 
 FLOATERS BOOKED
 Seadrill said third-quarter results would likely show good
growth after a bigger-than-expected rise in second-quarter
earnings. Its third-quarter performance will be enhanced by four
new rigs entering service and by a high fleet utilisation rate.
 ""All our deepwater floaters have secured employment
throughout 2011, something that insulates us against any
near-term volatility in this market segment,"" it said.
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) in the three months to the end of June
rose to $493 million from $438 million a year earlier, beating
the $471 million average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts.
 Its shares fell 1.1 percent to 145.3 crowns by 1033 GMT,
while Oslo's benchmark index fell 1.3 percent.
 One trader said the quarter was somewhat flattered by the
inclusion of one full month of results from acquired company
Scorpion Offshore, but earnings were still better than expected.
 Shares also fell in anticipation of Seadrill's weighting in
the OSEFX mutual fund index being cut in a quarterly rebalancing
at Tuesday's close, the trader said.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday in
markets dominated by concerns the U.S. economy is sliding back
into recession, prompting further flows into safe-haven assets.
 The yen - a favourite for carry trades at times of economic
stress - hovered back near 15-year high against the dollar after
investors brushed off Japan's attempt to weaken the currency,
yields on benchmark German government bonds hit record highs and
the Swiss franc soared against the euro and dollar.
 Mounting U.S. economic concerns likely to keep investors
away from riskier assets and push up the yen, keeping pressure
on Japan to intervene directly in currency markets for the first
time in more than six years.
Crude prices, seen as a proxy for world economic growth,
also came under pressure, and were down 6.6 percent so far in
August and on track for their worst monthly losses since May.
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index lost
0.9 percent. The index was also headed towards its worst monthly
performance in three months.
 Tokyo's Nikkei average shed 3.6 percent, its worst daily
drop in three months, after the Bank of Japan's move the day
before to boost cheap loans to banks failed to curb the yen's
strength.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 1.1 percent
and the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone Countries Index
fell 1.3 percent.
""If you look at all the noise, all the volatility and all
the nervousness, it's clear that this market has one major fear
at the moment and that's the double dip,"" said Philippe Gijsels,
head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in
Brussels.
 ""And we are not going to have the answer to that one until
the fourth quarter. There is more downside risk for equities
over the next couple of weeks.""
 The VDAX-NEW volatility index, Europe's main barometer of
investor anxiety, rose 3.4 percent. The higher the volatility
index, the lower investors' appetite for risk.
 
 YEN NEAR 15-YR HIGH
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 84.27 yen, not far from
its 15-year low of 83.58 hit last week. The U.S. currency fell
2.5 percent against the Japanese currency this month after
sliding 2.2 percent in July.
 ""Japan's ministry of finance is sending signals that is
willing to intervene but clearly people remember its struggle
with intervention a few years ago,"" said Simon Derrick, head of
currency research at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""If they don't intervene when the yen is at 84, when will
they do it? Once its goes to all time lows? I think their
resolve of staying away from intervention will be tested.""
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on Tuesday
that the government would take decisive action on currencies --
usually seen as code for intervention -- when necessary, but
reaction in the market was limited. The yen has lost more than 9
percent versus the greenback so far this year.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent against the yen to 106.65 yen,
crawling towards a nine-year low of 105.44 yen hit last week.
 The single currency also fell to an all-time low against the
Swiss franc, which also hovered close to a seven-month high
against the dollar.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year German Bunds hit record lows at
2.085 percent, while those on 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped 2
basis points to 2.5143 percent, hovering near 18-month low.
 In the commodity market, oil lost 1.4 percent to trade below
$74 a barrel, while copper dropped 0.9 percent but was still up
1.3 percent this month.

 * Union federation sees shift in sentiment
 * Planned sympathy strike for Thursday on hold
 
 By Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Striking South African
state workers will vote on Tuesday on an increased wage offer
made by the government to try to end a nearly three-week-old
strike, the COSATU union federation said.
 The government increased its offer to 7.5 percent from 7
percent -- compared to the union demand for 8.6 percent -- after
being ordered back to negotiations by President Jacob Zuma,
under growing political pressure over the stoppages.
 The strike has closed schools, prevented treatment at
hospitals and harmed investor sentiment in Africa's biggest
economy.
 ""The offer will be discussed by members today and they will
vote on whether to accept the new offer,"" COSATU President
Sidumo Dlamini told Reuters. ""We don't know what members will
do. Indeed there has been a shift and we expect members to look
at it critically.""
 Union officials said a decision on whether to accept the new
offer is likely to come early on Wednesday. 
 Analysts said the new offer could lead to an end of the
worst labour action in terms of man-days lost in three years.
 ""There is a reasonable prospect that we are going to get
this settled,"" said Gary van Staden, political analyst with NKC,
independent economists.
 As well as the proposed wage increase, the government raised
its offer for a monthly housing allowance to 800 rand ($109).
Unions have been demanding 1,000 rand.
 Rank and file members, feeling the pinch from lost wages
coming from the government's policy of ""no-work, no pay"" for
strikers, may want to end the dispute to prevent even more harm
to their finances, he said.
 
 WIDER STRIKE
 Although its impact on currency, bond and stock markets has
been minimal so far, that could change if the strike spreads to
the broader economy. COSATU has threatened a one-day sympathy
strike by all members on Thursday if no deal is reached.
 ""At this stage, the sympathy strike on Thursday is on hold,""
Dlamini said. That strike by nearly 2 million members of
affiliated unions would hit industries such as mining,
manufacturing and communications. [ID:nLDE67Q0DR]
 COSATU Secretary-General Zwelinzima Vavi said the group was
still ready to up the stakes: ""We have already mobilised for a
strike on Thursday. If the offer is rejected, then we are ready
for the mass strike.""
 Any agreement to end the dispute is likely to swell state
spending by about 1 to 2 percent, forcing the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 There are worries that the deal could lead to higher taxes
or cause South Africa to increase its borrowing, making it more
costly to obtain loans and leading to increased budget spending
to pay for servicing the debt.
 ""I think that it is more likely that we are going to see an
increase in borrowing, "" van Staden said. ""They really do have
to start worrying about their sovereign rating.""
 State workers said members would be angry the proposed pay
rises were lower than those the government earlier this year to
workers at major state-owned enterprises. They won raises more
than double inflation, which stood at 3.7 percent.
 ""The sore point is that parastatals received exceptional
increases despite their reliance on bailouts from the state
because their finances are in a mess,"" said a public sector
paramedic.
 Workers have also been angry at the large wage gap between
the lowest and highest paid civil servants. The lowest paid
state employees make about 40 percent less than the average
worker in South Africa, who takes home about 6,300 rand a month
in salary and benefits.
 ""I earn 9,000 rand a month. After deductions I bring home
about 5,000. If I worked in the private sector I would earn much
more,"" the paramedic said.

 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank left
interest rates on hold as forecast on Tuesday and signalled no
hikes in coming months as it did not expect drought-related
price rises to threaten mid-term inflation targets.
 The benchmark refinancing rate was left on hold at a record
low of 7.75 percent for a third month in a row, the central bank
having halted a 13-month easing cycle in May after 14 rate cuts
aimed at reviving sluggish domestic lending.
 The rouble extended losses to session lows of 34.56 against
its currency basket after the news, which confirmed no immediate
prospects of support from higher rates.
 The central bank said it expected rates to stay put over
coming months, ""which should encourage further growth in lending
activity and provide support for the economy on the path to
stable growth.""
 Inflation rose in August ""due to diverging estimates of the
impact of abnormal weather conditions on agriculture production
and to the rise of grain prices on the global market"".
 It said there were currently no grounds for concluding the
price spike would have a negative impact on mid- or long-term
inflation, though some analysts said risks existed.
 The central bank also noted ""signs of instability in the
recovery of economic growth"" in Russia and abroad, a further
potential reason not to tighten policy.
 
 WAITING GAME
 The Economy Ministry reckons the summer drought and
heatwave, which saw many factories halt production, could cut
this year's growth by up to 0.8 percentage points.
 ""The situation with inflation and economic dynamics is
seriously distorted by the summer drought and they clearly want
to wait until September data to decide what is really going on,""
said Maxim Oreshkin, senior strategist at Credit Agricole, who
expects that rate hikes will start in early 2011.
 Citibank's Elina Ribakova said the central bank's cautious
tone on inflation risks could be explained by its desire not to
further fuel inflation expectations. ""Risks clearly exist, an
acceleration of inflation is possible,"" she said.
 With drought killing off around a third of this year's crop,
consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in Aug. 1-23, as Russians
stockpiled buckwheat, flour and dry pasta.
 But year-on-year inflation is still modest, at 5.9 percent
in the month to Aug. 23 according to the central bank -- meaning
real interest rates are still well in positive territory.
 ""Inflation is not accelerating because of monetary factors
-- they cannot make food appear (in shops) by changing rates,""
said Pyotr Milovanov, a dealer at Metallinvestbank.
 The prospect for an extended period of unchanged rates added
to an already negative backdrop for the rouble, which had been
hurt earlier in the session by a retreat in oil prices and stock
markets.
 ""Of course it is not (a reason to buy roubles). Rates remain
at a very low level and that stimulates capital outflow rather
than its inflow,"" Credit Agricole's Oreshkin said.
 Most analysts polled by Reuters last week predicted the
central bank would start to hike rates in early 2011, although a
sizeable minority reckon the tightening could begin as soon as
the fourth quarter of 2010.
 ""It is not excluded that the regulator may have to raise the
refi rate already this year, for example in October-November if
September inflation data turns out to the be the same as
August's or even higher,"" said Natalya Orlova at Alfa Bank.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen rose towards a 15-year high
against the dollar on Tuesday as traders looked to test Japanese
authorities' resolve on intervention after the Bank of Japan's
easing steps the previous day failed to scare investors from
betting on it rising further.
 With mounting U.S. economic worries seen keeping investors
away from risk assets such as high-yielding currencies, the
market is likely to push up the low-yielding yen, which could
eventually prompt Japan to sell its currency in the markets for
the first time in more than six years.
 ""Will they intervene today? No. But markets will become more
nervous if the yen approaches 80 yen (to the dollar),"" said
Etsuko Yamashita, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp.
 ""If a raft of U.S. economic data due this week pushes the yen
higher, Japan may indeed intervene,"" she said. On top of closely
watched jobs numbers on Friday, there is housing price data on
Tuesday and manufacturing data on Wednesday.
 Traders said any Japanese intervention is likely to be a
unilateral action, given the perception that neither the United
States nor Europe would be keen to help boost the value of their
own currencies in light of weakness in their economies.
 Japanese authorities are expected to buy the dollar against
the yen to curb the yen's strength if the dollar slides 3-4 yen
in one day, traders said.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on Tuesday
that the government would take decisive action on currencies --
usually seen as code for intervention -- when necessary.
 But reaction in the market was limited.
 The dollar slid 0.4 percent to 84.27 yen, edging near the
15-year low of 83.58 hit last week. It fell 0.7 percent on Monday
as investors took profits after the Bank of Japan announced its
decision to expand a cheap funding programme.
 CORRELATION WITH U.S. TREASURIES
 The greenback fell nearly 2.6 percent against the Japanese
currency this month after sliding 2.2 percent in July and around
3 percent each in June and May.
 As the dollar/yen rate has had a strong correlation in recent
months with the yield gap between the United States and Japan, a
sharp fall in Treasury yields on Monday also weighed on the
dollar.
 Treasury prices jumped on Monday, with 30-year bond prices
rising two full points, recovering from a sharp sell-off on
Friday.
 In addition, the yen could face potential buyback pressure in
cross-yen trades such as euro/yen and Aussie/yen, which have
attracted some interest because of their larger yield
differentials.
 ""Many stop-losses for Japanese margin traders are expected to
be triggered when the Australian dollar falls below 75 yen,"" said
a trader at a Japanese brokerage.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to 75.24 yen, dented
by a 3 percent fall in Tokyo's Nikkei stock average that fuelled
risk aversion among Japanese investors.
 Japanese retail margin traders boosted their combined net
long position in dollar/yen and six cross/yen pairs by 53,138
contracts, or 13 percent, to 461,456 contracts on Monday,
according to Tokyo Financial Exchange data. This boosted their
combined net long positions in seven major currencies against the
yen near a record high of 508,101 lots marked on Aug. 24.
 If the yen keeps strengthening, margin traders will sooner or
later be forced to dump their heavy bets against the Japanese
currency, possibly adding momentum to its rise.
 In another sign of investor risk aversion, the euro slumped
to a record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc on heavy
selling by emerging market players.
 The euro fell as low as 1.2934 franc, down 0.4 percent on the
day.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent against the yen to 106.65 yen,
crawling towards a nine-year low of 105.44 yen hit last week.
 Against the dollar, the euro was little changed on the day at
$1.2659.
 It is expected to find some support around $1.2605, a 50
percent retracement of the euro's rally from June to early
August, and at a low of $1.2588 hit a week ago, although a break
below these levels could set off a fresh downward trend.
 Some traders said recent rises in spreads of sovereign CDS in
some euro zone countries, such as Ireland and Italy, were
rekindling fears about the euro zone's debt problems, which
pushed the single currency to a four-year low earlier this year.
 The Australian dollar climbed 0.3 percent to $0.8941, after a
stronger-than-expected reading in Australian retail sales.

issued a final rule late Monday for the retail foreign exchange
market, which included relaxing an earlier proposal that would
slash leverage available to investors participating in these
transactions.
 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission rule put in
place requirements for retail foreign exchange products,
including registration, disclosure, record keeping, financial
reporting and minimum capital standards.
 A key change in the rule, which goes into effect on Oct.
18, will allow the National Futures Association to put in place
leverage rules as long as they require investors to place a
minimum 2 percent security deposit in the case of major
currencies and 5 percent of the notional value of the
transaction for all other currencies.
 The agency said it will periodically review these
parameters to determine if they need to be adjusted.
 The CFTC earlier proposed limiting leverage for retail
customers on forex transactions to a ratio of 10-to-1, which
was criticized by dealers, lawmakers in Congress and others who
feared it could push investors into overseas markets with less
protection.
 ""These rules of the road will help protect the American
public in the largest area of retail fraud that the CFTC
oversees: retail foreign exchange,"" CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler
said in a statement.
 This marked the first final rule the CFTC has published
from the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that went into effect
in July. The CFTC has organized its to-do list into 30 topic
areas it must address during the next year.

demand
 * Export boom, govt spending point to brisk Q2 GDP growth
 * Data challenges market fears about drag from U.S.
slowdown
 By Wayne Cole
 SYDNEY, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Australian retail sales were
surprisingly strong in July while sales for June were revised
higher, suggesting consumption was not nearly as subdued as
feared and the next move in interest rates is still upward.
 Tuesday's raft of data also showed Australia's current
account deficit shrank to an eight-year low in the second
quarter as exports of iron ore and coal boomed, underpinning
expectations that the economy grew by a brisk 1 percent in the
quarter.
The Australian dollar  blipped higher after the
government reported retail sales rose 0.7 percent in July,
above the 0.4 percent forecast and the biggest gain since
March.
 ""The data is obviously stronger than expected and it does
start off the third quarter on a positive footing,"" said
Annette Beacher, a senior strategist at TD Securities.
 ""I think we're getting an overdue reality check that
consumers are much stronger that the market thinks.""
 Investors have been fretting that a slowdown in the United
States and Japan could spill over into Australia, where a
series of rate hikes earlier in the year had hit demand and
housing.
 As a result, the market has priced in a real chance that
the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would have to cut its 4.5
percent cash rate by year-end, even though the central bank
itself has remained resolutely upbeat on the economic outlook.
 ""The latest sales data is a real positive and supports the
RBA's confidence,"" said Brian Redican, a senior economist at
Macquarie. ""The economy is clearly travelling well and any talk
of a rate cut is nonsense right now.""
 The stronger-than-expected rise in sales in July followed
an upwardly revised 0.4 percent increase in June, which had
initially been reported at half that.

next government, see [ID:nSGE67U003]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 EXPORT BOOM
 Retail sales account for around 23 percent of Australia's
gross domestic product (GDP) and the sector is the second
biggest employer after the health industry, with about 11
percent of all jobs.
 Second-qaruter GDP figures are due on Wednesday and
analysts look for a rise of around 1.0 percent, double the
first quarter gain. That would lift growth for the year to 2.9
percent and mark 19 straight years without a recession, a
record few others can match.
 Australia owes much of its good fortune to the
industrialisation of China and India, which is driving strong
demand for its resource exports, particularly coal and iron
ore.
 A resulting boom in export earnings helped shrink the
country's current account deficit by 66 percent to A$5.64
billion ($5 billion) in the second quarter, the lowest since
early 2002.
Export volumes also outstripped imports to add a solid 0.4
percentage points to GDP in the quarter, a little more than
analysts had expected.
 Also adding to growth was a 1.3 percent rise in real
government spending last quarter, which again topped forecasts
and could add around 0.3 percentage points to GDP.
 Other data out on Tuesday showed approvals to build new
homes also beat expectations with a rise of 2.3 percent in
July, though all the gains came in the volatile apartment
sector.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2010 11:36PM ET</span>",POLL-Japan fund managers up stock weighting to 4-mth high," By Akiko Takeda
 TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers raised their
weighting for equities to a four-month high in August but
persisting uncertainty over the global economy limited aggressive
allocations in stocks, a Reuters poll showed.
 Fund managers cut their weighting for bonds for a second
straight month to the lowest since March, although the level
remained relatively high, underscoring the appetite for
safe-haven assets, the survey also showed.
 ""The outlook for the U.S. economy as well as other countries
is becoming increasingly unclear. We won't be able to take bigger
risks than usual in this kind of situation,"" said Yoshinori
Nagano, a senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.
 ""Still, the market is starting to price in this factor so we
shouldn't be overly pessimistic from now,"" he added.
 Fund managers raised their average allocation for equities to
45.2 percent in August, after cutting the weighting to a more
than 11-year low of 44.2 percent in July, the survey showed on
Tuesday.
 Their weighting for bonds dropped to a five-month low of 47.9
percent in August from 48.2 percent the previous month.
 The Reuters poll of 13 fund management companies was
conducted Aug. 17-25, during which the benchmark Nikkei stock
average fell below the 9,000-level for the first time since May
2009.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
fell below 0.9 percent for the first time since August 2003
during the survey period.
 Cash positions of Japanese fund managers dropped but stayed
at a high level of 4.0 percent due to growing uncertainty over
the global economic outlook, according to the survey.
 They raised their weighting for real estate to 1.5 percent in
August from 1.2 percent, while lowering their weighting for
alternative investments, such as hedge funds and commodities, to
1.4 percent from 1.7 percent.
 U.S. WORRIES
 Investors became more pessimistic about the U.S. economy
after a series of disappointing employment and other data clouded
the outlook for Japan's key export destination.
 Worry about the U.S. economy pushed the dollar to a 15-year
low of 83.58 yen last week, another big headache for Japan's
export-oriented firms because it makes their products more
expensive overseas and erodes their profits when repatriated.
 ""It has become more clear that the economic trend has turned
weaker,"" said Hisashi Iwama, a senior portfolio manager at DIAM
Co Ltd.
 ""The market is expected to be nervous towards the autumn
ahead of the U.S. midterm elections,"" he said.
 In terms of regional equities allocations, fund managers
raised their weighting for Asian equities to 11.0 percent -- the
highest since July 1996.
 They also raised their equities weightings in the euro zone
and Japan, while lowering weightings in North America and
Britain, the survey showed.
 Fund managers lowered their bond weightings in the euro zone
and Japan.
 Their bond weighting in the euro zone fell to a record low of
25.5 percent due to persisting concerns about the region's
sovereign debt crisis.
 But fund mangers increased their bond weighting in North
America to 33.6 percent, matching the highest level since
February 2007.
 Their allocation in Asian bonds rose for the third straight
month, to 4.9 percent -- the second highest level ever.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 TAIPEI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Fears that policymakers around
the world will be slow to support the flagging global recovery
lifted the yen on Tuesday, weighed on Asian and European stocks
and gave further fuel to a five-month rally in U.S. and
Japanese government bonds.
 Japan's Nikkei stock index led declines in the region,
tumbling 3.6 percent, as investors grew more concerned that
officials were not going to halt the relentless rise in the
yen, which has gained 11 percent since May.
 Leading European stocks fell 1.2 percent in early trade,
while S&P 500 futures were down 1.5 percent, pointing to a
weaker opening on Wall Street as investors braced for what is
expected to be more gloomy economic U.S. data.
 With governments, especially in fiscally weak advanced
economies, wary of new stimulus spending to support their
recoveries, safety has been the name of the game for investors
in August.
 Gold prices have risen around 5 percent this month, on
track for the largest monthly gain since April, while the
benchmark yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note dropped 39
basis points in August, its biggest drop since December 2008.
 Investors ignored slightly stronger-than-expected U.S.
consumption data overnight and focused on the August U.S.
payrolls report due on Friday to see if private sector hiring
held up despite expected layoffs in the public sector.
 A disappointing payrolls figure for a third consecutive
month along with poor readings of housing and manufacturing
data will probably depress bond yields further and put upward
pressure on the yen, which is near a 15-year high against the
dollar.
 ""Though the U.S. spending data yesterday wasn't bad, it's
the indicators out later this week that are the really
important ones, and predictions for these are really raising
fears about the economic recovery,"" said Takashi Ushio, head of
the investment strategy division at Marusan Securities in
Tokyo.
 U.S. housing, consumer and regional business data are all
expected later in the day.
 In Japan, the Nikkei share average suffered its worst
single-day decline since June 7, led by a mix of technology and
retailing stocks.
 The Nikkei has tumbled more than 7 percent in August, set
for the largest monthly decline since May, on worries that the
global recovery may be stalling and as the surging yen
threatened to curb exports, which have been driving Japan's
fragile recovery.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell
1.6 percent, with commodity-related shares the biggest drag on
fears of weaker demand for raw materials.
 The region has fared better than others, however, thanks to
its relatively strong growth prospects. The Asia Pacific
ex-Japan index is down 4 percent so far this year, compared
with a 7 percent decline on the MSCI world equities index
 INDOMITABLE YEN
 The yen's four-month rise against the dollar is its longest
string of gains since 2008. On Tuesday, the dollar was down 0.6
percent at 84.15 yen near a 15-year low of 83.58 yen touched
last week.
 The Bank of Japan boosted a cheap loan scheme on Monday
after an emergency meeting, but investors saw the move as a
minimal, symbolic gesture that will do little to halt the yen's
climb.
 Market players may now test the government's resolve to
back its words with yen-selling intervention, analysts said,
though few expect it to move any time soon unless the
currency's gains accelerate.
 Much of the currency's rise has been attributable to
factors outside of Tokyo's control: prolonged U.S. dollar
weakness on fears it may be sliding back into recession, and a
flight to so-called safe havens like the yen as investors shun
riskier global assets.
Nevertheless, ""if U.S. economic data due this week pushes the
yen higher, Japan may indeed intervene,"" said Etsuko Yamashita,
chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
 The New Zealand dollar dropped 1.3 percent against the yen
to 58.86 yen after a major finance company in New Zealand
failed.
 Government bonds rose as equity markets sagged.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to 2.53 percent
from 2.55 percent late on Friday in New York. Investors have
been buying longer-dated paper for the extra bit of yield,
causing the yield advantage of 10-year notes over 2-year notes
to shrink by 33 basis points in August.
 After a sharp drop on Monday, Japanese government bond
futures rose 0.28 point to 142.73
 However, supply concerns could haunt long-maturity paper
after Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the government
could compile an extra budget if necessary, after the cabinet
decided on Monday to compile economic steps using reserves from
this fiscal year's budget.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The yen clung near a 15-year high
against the dollar on Tuesday after the Bank of Japan's easing
steps the previous day failed to scare investors from betting on
it rising further.
 With mounting U.S. economic worries seen keeping investors
shunning risk assets such as high-yielding currencies, the market
is likely to push up the low-yielding yen, testing the
willingness of Japanese authorities to intervene.
 ""If share prices fail to rise, that could lead to selling in
the cross yen, which would put pressure on the dollar/yen,"" said
Nobuhiko Akai, senior manager of forex trading at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""The dollar/yen might test the previous low (of 83.58 hit
last week) by the end of this week,"" Akai said.
 The dollar changed hands at 84.58 yen, about a full yen above
the 15-year low of 83.58 hit last week. It fell 0.7 percent on
Monday as investors took profits after the Bank of Japan
announced its decision to expand a cheap funding programme.
 The yen showed no reaction to a series of Japanese data,
including better-than-expected readings in industrial output and
retail sales.
 As the dollar/yen has had a strong correlation with the yield
gap between the United States and Japan in recent months, a sharp
fall in U.S. Treasuries on Monday also weighed on the dollar.
 U.S. Treasuries prices jumped on Monday, with 30-year bond
prices rising two full points, recovering from a sharp sell-off
on Friday.
 The euro/yen fell 0.2 percent to 106.80 yen after having
fallen nearly 2 yen on Monday.
 Fresh selling in the euro against the Swiss franc on Tuesday
pushed the pair to a record low of 1.2959 francs, as investors
put funds to what is often considered a safe-haven currency.
 Against the dollar, the euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2637, not
far from a low of $1.2588 hit a week ago.
 Some traders say recent rises in spreads of sovereign CDS in
some euro zone countries, such as Ireland and Italy, are
rekindling fears about the euro zone's debt problems, which
pushed the single currency to a four-year low early this year.
 The Australian dollar fetched $0.8910, with traders looking
to a series of Australian data releases, including retail sales
figures, at 0130 GMT. July sales are expected to have risen 0.4
percent compared to 0.2 percent in June.

 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday on
skepticism that governments can reverse a slowdown in global
growth, while the yen rallied after Japan's action to expand
loans to banks disappointed investors who had wanted more
aggressive measures to curb the currency's rise.
 Investors' worries about the economy also weighed on the
price of crude oil, while U.S. Treasury prices rose in a
rebound from a sharp sell-off on Friday after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled that the U.S. central bank was
not on the verge of a new round of bond buying.
 U.S. President Barack Obama's attempt on Monday to address
worries the recovery is faltering appeared to fall short. U.S.
stocks extended an early slide, with all three major indexes
closing down more than 1 percent. [ID:nN30177410].
 A government report on Monday that U.S. consumer spending
rose at the strongest pace in four months in July did little to
to reverse a bearish tone set by a string of other data
suggesting the economy is slowing.
 The Commerce Department data also showed that consumer
spending, which typically accounts for about two-thirds of U.S.
economic activity, was supported by a small rise in incomes.
For details, see [ID:nN30166431].
 Investors were also hesitant ahead of more closely watched
data on manufacturing, services and August non-farm payrolls
due later in the week.
 European markets were subdued on Monday, with British
markets closed for a bank holiday.
 ""Equity markets are going to be a little bit defensive this
week as the economic data is likely going to show more slowing
in the economy,"" said John Brady, senior vice president at MF
Global in Chicago.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 140.92 points, or 1.39 percent, to 10,009.73. The Standard

 Volume was the lowest for the year-to-date.
 Sectors associated with economic growth took the biggest
hits, incouding banks and consumer discretionary stocks.
Citigroup  fell 2.4 percent to $3.67, while JP Morgan
 fell 2.0 percent to $35.85. The KBW Bank Index lost
1.21 percent.
 News on mergers and acquisitions bolstered some stocks, but
was not enough to turn the market positive.
 Genzyme Corp  rose 3.39 percent to $69.91 after
France's Sanofi-Aventis SA  disclosed a cash offer of
$18.5 billion, or $69 per share, to buy the U.S. biotechnology
company. Later, Genzyme broke a five-week silence to reject the
bid. For details, see [ID:nLDE67T031]
 Genzyme shares gained, but U.S.-listed shares of Sanofi
 fell 1 percent to $28.63.
 Expectations of increased mergers and acquisitions have
buoyed stock markets in recent days as the activity often
bolsters the equity of the parties or their sectors.
 ""There is a lot of cash still out there for a lot of these
companies, and they need to start using it,"" said Joe Saluzzi,
co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
 Intel Corp  agreed to buy the wireless unit of

outweighed support from the merger and acquisition news.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 0.1 percent

just 50.1 percent of the 90-day average.
 Pharma shares featured among the best performers, with
Sanofi-Aventis  up 0.7 percent.
 Japanese stocks closed up nearly 1.8 percent, but only
after paring strong gains when the Bank of Japan made minor
tweaks in policy, disappointing markets looking for more
aggressive action against deflation. The yen rose broadly.
 ""The market was underwhelmed,"" said Marc Chandler, global
head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York. ""Japanese officials continued to struggle to get ahead of
the curve of expectations.""
 The yen hit the day's high against the dollar and the euro
after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said after

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar sagged
against the greenback on Monday, taking its cue from soft
domestic economic data and worries about the U.S. recovery and
global growth.
 The Canadian dollar, and other riskier currencies such the
euro and sterling, also came under pressure as yen rose broadly
after the Bank of Japan's decision to expand cheap loans to
banks disappointed investors who had looked for more aggressive
measures to curb the yen's strength.
 ""It was kind of a risk-off sort of feel,"" said Shaun
Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities.
 ""The Bank of Japan decision was really quite disappointing
relative to what the markets expected or hoped the Bank of
Japan would do. It was a relatively benign easing.""
 As well, data on Monday showed Canada's July producer price
index edged up just 0.1 percent in July, compared with
expectations of 0.4 percent. [ID:nSCLUJE64Z] Meanwhile, the
current account deficit rose more than expected in the second
quarter. [ID:nN30171389]

Canada next week,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a currency strategist at
Scotia Capital, referring to the central bank's next interest
rate announcement on Sept. 8.
 Elsewhere, U.S. stocks fell as a statement from President
Barack Obama fell short of addressing worries the recovery is

 The Canadian currency ended the North American session at
C$1.0605 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.30 U.S. cents, down from
C$1.0524 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.02 U.S. cents, at Friday's
close.
 Tuesday's release of Canada's second-quarter gross domestic
product data may help seal expectations of whether the Bank of
Canada will raise interest rates next month.
 After bolting out of the gate in the first quarter with
growth of 6.1 percent, the April to June measure of economic
expansion in Canada is likely to be decidedly slower, at less
than half that pace. [ID:nN2750745]
 Economists surveyed by Reuters forecast, on average, 2.5
percent annualized growth in second-quarter GDP.
 Osborne said if the data disappoints, it may spark further
weakness in the currency, however he does not expect it to
break beyond the recent range of around C$1.04 to C$1.0660 to
the U.S. dollar.
 ""I think it would have to be exceptionally weak tomorrow to
drive the Canadian dollar much beyond C$1.0650-60.""
 But for the next 24 to 48 hours, Osborne said the currency
is not seen weakening further than C$1.0665 or strengthening
beyond C$1.0425.
 Tugging in both directions for the currency, Canada's
primary securities dealers forecast the central bank will raise
its key rate by a quarter-point to 1.0 percent on Sept. 8, but
market pricing is less certain.
 Markets on Monday, as measured by a Reuters calculation of
yields on overnight index swaps, are leaning towards the bank
keeping the rate unchanged. 
 Osborne noted the lack of direction on Monday was partly
due to a UK holiday robbing the markets of a bit more volume,
and he expected activity to pick up next week after the Labor
Day long weekend in Canada and the United States draws summer
to an unofficial end.
 Friday's U.S. payrolls report may also sway rate
expectations, given the Bank of Canada has suggested further
interest rate hikes would be weighed against domestic and
global economic developments.
 BONDS FIRM
 The mixed sentiment on interest rate expectations and a
slower world growth profile have kept government bond prices
supported in recent weeks.
 Canadian government bonds tracked U.S. Treasuries higher on
Monday as U.S. equities drifted lower and traders clawed back
some of the sharp losses on Friday, when U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the U.S. central bank was not on
the verge of a new round of bond buying. [US/]

 By Wanfeng Zhou and Aleksandra Michalska
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Monday
after the Bank of Japan's decision to expand cheap loans to
banks disappointed investors who had looked for more aggressive
measures to curb the yen's strength.
 The dollar fell below 85 yen and the euro lost more than 1
percent against the Japanese currency after the BOJ beefed up
the supply of fixed-rate loans to banks to 30 trillion yen
($351 billion) from 20 trillion yen.
 Investors saw the central bank's moves as a symbolic
gesture that will do little to halt the currency's climb,
putting the onus on the Japanese government to act to protect
exports and fight deflation if the yen continues to rally.
 ""The market was underwhelmed,"" said Marc Chandler, global
head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York. ""Japanese officials continued to struggle to get ahead of
the curve of expectations.""
 In early afternoon trading, the dollar fell 0.6 percent to
84.71 yen ,down from the day's high above 85.92 hit before the
BOJ announcement, according to Reuters data. The dollar earlier
hit a session low of 84.56 yen, not far from its 15-year low of
83.58 yen set on electronic trading platform EBS last week.
 ""The yen will probably stay exactly where it is now, said
Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo,
 ""Clearly, additional monetary policies and extra funds that
the Bank of Japan added aren't enough to see the yen weaken,""
he said. I don't think it will go much higher than 84-85.""
 Adding to strength in the yen were comments from Bank of
Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, who said after meeting with
Prime Minister Naoto Kan that Kan had not made any requests
regarding the central bank's monetary policy. Shirakawa refused
to comment on recent currency moves.
 Earlier in the day, Shirakawa said policy steps will not be
bound by moves in the yen and stocks and the rise in the yen
was down to investor aversion to risk.
 The BOJ's move and the official comments encouraged
investors to add to long yen positions on speculation currency
intervention by Japan was not imminent.
 A trader said stop-loss orders to sell the dollar under
84.90 yen helped accelerate the pair's slide. Support comes in
at around 84.50, while resistance is at 86 yen. The euro fell
1.2 percent to 107.36 yen.
 LONG YEN POSITIONS
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
investors increased long positions in the yen and the Swiss
franc in the week to Aug. 24 as worries about a slowing global
economy drove investors to perceived safe-haven currencies.
 Analysts expect the yen to rise further against the dollar
if expectations mount that the U.S. Federal Reserve will act to
spur growth, moving more aggressively than the BOJ.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday the U.S. economic
recovery has weakened more than expected and the Fed stands
ready to act if needed to spur slowing growth.
 ""Dollar/yen's outlook appears very much tied to the
prospects for U.S. interest rates and U.S. data,"" Aroop
Chatterjee, currency strategist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a
note.
 Some analysts cautioned, however, that recent pessimism
about the global economy may have been overblown.
 ""I'm more optimistic on the global economy than the market
is,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at Interactive
Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""I don't think the yen
is going to continue rising. I wouldn't be surprised if we have
seen the peak of yen strength at this stage.""
 Aside from the yen, currency movements were limited in
European trade, with London markets closed for a holiday. 
 The euro lost 0.7 percent to $1.2672, as losses in the U.S.
stock market weighed on risk appetite.
 Investors are now turning attention to the release on
Tuesday of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Aug. 10
meeting to get further insight into why policymakers opted to
buy more Treasury securities. Following that is the widely
watched U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday on
skepticism that governments can reverse a slowdown in global
growth, while the yen resumed its rally after Japan's action to
expand loans to banks disappointed investors who had wanted
more aggressive measures to curb the currency's rise.
 Investors' worries about the economy also weighed on the
price of crude oil, while U.S. Treasury prices rose in a
rebound from a sharp sell-off on Friday after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled that the U.S. central bank was
not on the verge of a new round of bond buying.
 A government report on Monday that U.S. consumer spending
rose at the strongest pace in four months in July did little to
to reverse a bearish tone set by a string of other data
suggesting the economy is slowing.
 The Commerce Department data also showed that consumer
spending, which typically accounts for about two-thirds of U.S.
economic activity, was supported by a small rise in incomes.
For details, see [ID:nN30166431].
 Investors were also hesitant ahead of more closely watched
data on manufacturing, services and August non-farm payrolls
due later in the week.
 European markets were subdued on Monday, with British
markets closed for a bank holiday.
 ""Equity markets are going to be a little bit defensive this
week as the economic data is likely going to show more slowing
in the economy,"" said John Brady, senior vice president at MF
Global in Chicago.
 At midday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> fell 65.13 points, or 0.64 percent, to 10,085.52. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> slipped 6.99 points, or 0.66
percent, to 1,057.60 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
declined 15.55 points, or 0.72 percent, to 2,138.08.
 Bank stocks took the brunt of selling. Citigroup  fell
1.1 percent to $3.72, while JP Morgan  fell 1.1 percent
to $36.19. The BKW Bank Index lost 1.34 percent.
 A burst of merger and acquisition action was not enough to
turn stocks positive.
 Genzyme Corp  rose 3.7 percent to $70.10 after
France's Sanofi-Aventis SA  disclosed a cash offer of
$18.5 billion, or $69 per share, to buy the U.S. biotechnology
company. Later, Genzyme broke a five-week silence to reject the
bid. For details, see [ID:nLDE67T031]
 Genzyme rose 3.8 percent to $70.18, but U.S.-listed shares
of Sanofi  fell 0.1 percent to $28.90.
 Expectations of increased mergers and acquisitions have
buoyed stock markets in recent days as the activity often
bolsters the equity of the parties or their sectors.
 ""There is a lot of cash still out there for a lot of these
companies, and they need to start using it,"" said Joe Saluzzi,
co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
""It makes sense for them to see if they can get some value.""
 Intel Corp  agreed to buy the wireless unit of
German chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG  for $1.4

about 0.1 percent. MSCI's emerging market sub-index <.MSCIEF>
gained 0.3 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> ended slightly
lower, as the concerns about the global economic recovery
outweighed support from the merger and acquisition news.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 0.1 percent
at 1,025.48 points. Trading was thin, with volumes on the index
just 50.1 percent of the 90-day average.
 Pharma shares featured among the best performers, with
Sanofi-Aventis  up 0.7 percent.
 Japanese stocks closed up nearly 1.8 percent, but only
after paring strong gains when the Bank of Japan made minor
tweaks in policy, disappointing markets looking for more
aggressive action against deflation. The yen rose broadly.
 ""The market was underwhelmed,"" said Marc Chandler, global
head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York. ""Japanese officials continued to struggle to get ahead of

 The yen hit the day's high against the dollar and the euro
after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said after

 * Will affect foreign-led projects
 
 (Adds details, background)
 By Raushan Nurshayeva
 ASTANA, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan plans to double its
crude oil export duty to $40 per tonne from Jan. 1, two
government sources told Reuters on Monday, less than six months
after reinstating the tax when prices recovered from lows in the
financial crisis.
 The government cabinet of Kazakhstan, Central Asia's biggest
oil producer, will discuss the issue at its regular meeting on
Tuesday, both sources said.
 ""This data already officially exists. We are expecting the
decree from the government,"" one of the two sources said.
 A government spokesman said budgetary issues would be
discussed on Tuesday, but added he did not have any details of
the meeting and had no knowledge of revisions to the oil duty.
 Kazakhstan's decision to bring back a tax on almost all
crude oil exports in July effectively revised the terms of its
long-standing agreements with two major foreign-led oil groups.

 At $20 per tonne, the current duty is a tenth of the level
applied before the tax was scrapped in January 2009 in a move to
help producers ride out low crude prices during the global
financial crisis.
Analysts have compared Kazakhstan's reintroduction of the
duty to efforts by Russia and other resource-rich nations to
become more assertive with foreign investors at a time of a high
oil price cycle.
The move follows a number of steps by Kazakhstan over the
past few years to revise production-sharing terms with groups
led by U.S. energy giant Chevron and a consortium of ENI and BG
, despite protests from the majors.
 The Chevron-led Tengiz group and the Karachaganak consortium
led by BG and ENI will no longer be exempt from the duty,
Finance Minister Bolat Zhamishev said in July.
 Kazakhstan hopes to collect about $406 million in additional
revenue from the current duty by the end of this year.
 Tengiz and Karachaganak are set to be dwarfed by another
project, Kashagan, when an ENI-led group launches production at
one of the world's biggest fields later this decade.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - World stocks wavered on Monday
on skepticism that governments can cushion a slippage in global
growth, while the yen resumed its rally as Japan refrained from
aggressive action to curb the currency's rise.
 Mergers and acquisitions added some buoyancy to global
stock indices, however.
 A U.S. report on consumer spending offered hope for the
largest contributor to the nation's gross domestic product but
failed to reverse a bearish tone set by a string of other data
suggesting the economy is slowing. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke last week detailed a struggling economy, even as he
assured markets that the central bank could provide stimulus if
needed.
 ""I don't see any comfort in these words,"" said Koen De
Leus, economist at KBC Securities.
 ""They have done everything to save the economy, but it is
faltering again,"" he said. ""The U.S. data are going to be
disappointing and the stock market is likely to head lower in
the next one to two months because of the grim economic
outlook.""
 Gloomy reports on U.S. gross domestic product and housing
have raised fears the economy could slip back into a recession
or face a lengthy period of growth too slow to make much of a
dent in the country's 9.5 percent unemployment rate.
 Consumer spending rose at the strongest pace in four months
in July, supported by a small rise in incomes that offered hope
consumers were contributing to a modest recovery. For details,

 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Monday
after the Bank of Japan's decision to expand a fund supply tool
disappointed investors who had looked for more aggressive
measures to curb the yen's strength.
 The dollar fell below 85 yen and the euro lost about 1
percent against the Japanese currency after the BOJ beefed up
the supply of fixed-rate loans to banks to 30 trillion yen
($351 billion) from 20 trillion yen.
 Investors saw the central bank's moves as a symbolic

continues to rally. [ID:nTOE67S01V]
 ""An increase in the program by 10 trillion yen really
wasn't what the market was looking for,"" said Andrew Busch,
currency strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago. ""It
really leaves one to believe that their policy choices are
limited as far as the currency goes.""
 In early New York trading, the dollar fell 0.5 percent to
84.68 yen , down from the day's high above 85.90 yen hit
before the BOJ announced its policy decision. The dollar had
earlier hit a session low of 84.56 yen, according to Reuters
data, not far from its 15-year low of 83.58 yen set on
electronic trading platform EBS last week.
 Adding to strength in the yen were comments from Bank of

central bank's monetary policy. Shirakawa refused to comment on
recent currency moves.

 The BOJ's move and the official comments encouraged
investors to add to long yen positions as the comments were
seen as an indication that FX intervention by Japan was not
imminent.
 ""People are once again putting on short dollar/yen
positions, having reduced their long exposure ahead of the
meeting,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea
in Copenhagen.
 A trader in London said that stop-loss orders to sell the
dollar under 84.90 yen helped accelerate the pair's slide.
 LONG YEN POSITIONS INCREASE
 The euro  fell roughly 1 percent to around 107.65
yen. Against the dollar, the euro lost 0.4 percent to $1.2707

 Analysts expect the yen to rise further against the dollar
if expectations mount that the U.S. Federal Reserve will act to
spur growth down the road, moving more aggressively than the
BOJ.

 * BOJ announces tweaks to fixed rate fund supply scheme
 * BOJ's Shirakawa: policy steps not bound by yen, stocks
 
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Monday
after the Bank of Japan failed to signal aggressive monetary
easing measures to help curb yen strength at an emergency
meeting, choosing only to expand a fund supply scheme.
 Investors saw the moves as a symbolic gesture that will do
little to halt the currency's climb, putting the onus on the
Japanese government to act if the yen continues to rally.
 The yen hit the day's high against the dollar and the euro
after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said after
meeting Prime Minister Naoto Kan that Kan had not made any
requests on the central bank's monetary policy.
 He also refused to comment on recent currency moves,
following the yen's rally to a 15-year high against the dollar
and a nine-year peak versus the euro last week, which some
investors took as a green light to keep buying the yen.
 ""At the end of the day, the extension of the loan program
and the economic measures are too tepid to spark a dramatic
reversal of yen strength,"" said Roberto Mialich, currency
strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Kan said the government would compile steps to help the
economy using 920 billion yen in budget reserves.
 Earlier in the day, Shirakawa had said policy steps will not
be bound by moves in the yen and stocks and that the rise in the
yen was due to investor risk aversion.
 The BOJ's move and the official comments encouraged
investors to add to long yen positions as the comments were seen
as an indication that FX intervention by Japan was not imminent.
 By 1032 GMT, the dollar had slipped 0.7 percent on the day
to a session trough of 84.62 yen, according to Reuters data. It
tumbled from the day's high around 85.90 yen hit before the BOJ
announced its policy decision.
 ""People are once again putting on short dollar/yen
positions, having reduced their long exposure ahead of the
meeting,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea
in Copenhagen.
 A trader in London said that stop-loss orders to sell the
dollar under 84.90 yen helped to accelerate the U.S. currency's
slide.
 The euro fell roughly 1 percent to around 107.50 yen. The
shared currency's losses against the yen pulled it down 0.4
percent to $1.2700.
 Aside from the yen, currency movements were limited in
European trade, with London markets closed for a holiday.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar dipped 0.1
percent to 82.842, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars
were little changed versus their U.S. counterpart.
 
 LONG YEN POSITIONS INCREASE
 Analysts expect the yen to rise further against the dollar
if expectations mount that the Federal Reserve will act to spur
growth down the road, moving more aggressively than the BOJ.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday
the economic recovery has weakened more than expected and the
Fed stands ready to act if needed to spur slowing growth.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
investors increased long positions in the yen and the Swiss
franc in the week to Aug. 24 as worries about a slowing global
economy encourage investors to seek perceived safe-haven
currencies.
 Last week, the dollar fell to 83.58 yen on trading platform
EBS, its weakest since 1995, on falls in U.S. Treasury yields
and fears of a double-dip U.S. recession.
 Sterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.5560, supported after
better-than-expected UK economic growth numbers on Friday.

 MILAN, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Italian engineering firm Trevi
Finanziaria Industriale sees a better second half helped by
orders in South America, despite weak construction sales, its
chief executive said on Monday.
 ""We expect the second half to be better than the first and
this is confirmed by orders in South America, particularly in
oil drilling,"" Chief Executive Stefano Trevisani told Reuters in
an interview. He added that both sales and margins are expected
to improve.
 However, sales of construction equipment should take at
least nine months to recover to pre-crisis levels, Trevisani
said.
 Family owned Trevi operates in oil drilling and is a world
leader in special foundations such as for levees and dams. It
competes with Britain's Keller Group Plc and Germany's Bauer AG
.
 Trevi posted a first-half net profit on Friday of about 23
million euros ($30 million), down more than 54 percent from a
year ago. It forecast full-year revenue of around 1 billion
euros.
 Its shares fell sharply last week on anticipation of weak
results. They were down 1.7 percent at 9.83 euros by 1025 GMT on
Monday as the STOXX 600 construction index was up 0.54 percent.
 ""Construction equipment sales will recover no earlier than
in nine-months time, if for recovery we mean activity levels
seen in 2008 and the beginning of 2009,"" Trevisani said.
 
 POSITIVE SIGNALS
 ""We see a positive trend for orders in the services and
drilling sectors, which have not had significant fluctuations in
the last 12 months.""
 Trevisani said the group had a seven- to eight-month
visibility on revenues and he saw some positive signals in
several markets for the first quarter of 2011.
 ""The group works in five continents. We continue to see no
big signs of recovery in Europe. We have a strong presence in
North and South America where the trend is positive and we want
to increase our presence in Asia.""
 Chief Financial Officer Daniele Forti said in the interview
the group was in talks for a major order in the Middle East, but
cautioned that talks could take some time.
 Trevi shares lost 20 percent in the last eight sessions,
hurt by a downgrade to ""neutral"" from Mediobanca. The bank cited
delays in new orders including a 2 billion euro order for the
repair of a dam at Mosul in northern Iraq.

(Adds details, background)
 ISTANBUL, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The flow of Iraqi crude from
the northern Kirkuk fields to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan
has stopped due to an electrical problem on a part of the
pipeline inside Turkey, shipping agents said on Monday.
 Pumping stopped late on Sunday, one of the shippers said.
 Repair work to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, which transports
about a quarter of all Iraqi oil exports, was underway and flows
were expected to resume late on Monday, both shipping agents
said on condition of anonymity.
 This is at least the third outage this month on the key
energy corridor, which faces frequent sabotage and technical
problems.
 Five tankers were waiting at Ceyhan to load their cargoes,
one shipper said. 
 ""There are about 400,000 tonnes of cargo in the shore tanks.
We expect the resumption of loading late tonight,"" he said.
 Shippers already faced delays of three days in loading times
at Ceyhan before the pipeline outage, another agent said.
 Officials at the Turkish Energy Ministry and Botas, Turkey's
state pipeline operator, were unable to confirm the outage.
 A rupture on Aug. 21 knocked out flows for three days. On
Aug. 11, an explosion blamed on the Kurdistan Workers Party, a
guerrilla group fighting the Turkish army, stopped the flow of
oil for two days. Two people were killed in the ensuing fire.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - World stocks put in modest gains
and the dollar slipped on Monday, lifted by last week's
assurance from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it will do what is
needed to spur economic recovery.
 Early indications were that Wall Street would also start on
an up note.
 Mergers and acquisitions continued to buoy European shares.
Japanese stocks closed up nearly 1.8 percent, but only after
paring earlier strong gains when the Bank of Japan made only
minor tweaks in policy, disappointing markets looking for more
aggressive action against deflation.
 The yen rose after the decision as expectation of imminent
market intervention to weaken the currency faded.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index and the Thomson Reuters
global stock index both gained around 0.4 percent. MSCI's
emerging market sub-index was up 0.8 percent.
 A major catalyst was Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's playing
down of the likelihood that the slowing U.S. economy might slip
back into recession.
 ""(It) was reassuring, but predictably so. There was no big
positive surprise,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment
strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 ""As long as the economy stays out of recession, and we have
some growth, the markets won't be too worried. The consensus is
there won't be a double dip.""
 Trading in Europe was thinned by a holiday in Britain, but
the FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.4 percent.
 News of mergers and acquisitions has been a factor in
generally buoying stock markets in recent days.
 On Monday, the buzz was around French aerospace parts maker
Zodiac Aerospace reportedly launching an offer for French
conglomerate Safran. South Korean group POSCO said it was
considering a takeover of Elkem, a maker of silicon for solar
panels, and a unit of Norway's Orkla.
French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis also publicly disclosed its
$18.5 billion cash offer for U.S. biotechnology company Genzyme
Corp.
 M&A activity in August had reached $228 billion by Friday,
not far from the $260 billion record for the month hit in 2006,
before the financial crisis.
 
 BOJ SHUNS AGGRESSION
 The yen rose against the dollar after the Bank of Japan
failed to signal aggressive measures to curb yen strength at an
emergency meeting, choosing only to expanded a fixed-rate fund
supply scheme.
 The central bank's moves were seen by investors as a
symbolic gesture that will do little to halt the currency's
climb which is hurting exports and may prolong deflation.
""People are once again putting on short dollar/yen positions,

Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
The dollar was down 0.5 percent against the yen at 84.78 yen,
close to a session low of around 84.73 yen.
The dollar was also down 0.1 percent against a basket of
currencies.
 German government bonds resumed their climb following a
steep fall late last week but held well below record highs
struck recently with a public holiday in Britain dampening
trading activity.

 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Japan's public pension fund, the
world's largest with $1.4 trillion in assets, posted its first
negative return in five quarters in April-June due to falls in
global share prices and a rise in the yen.
 The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), whose
portfolio is larger than the Indian economy, said the rate of
return on its investments fell to minus 2.94 percent in
April-June from plus 1.29 percent in the prior quarter.
 It was its first quarterly decline since January-March 2009
and the biggest drop since October-December 2008 when the failure
of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers threw global financial
markets into turmoil.
 GPIF, a conservative investor with two-thirds of its assets
in Japanese government bonds, still managed to outperform the
more aggressive California Public Employees' Retirement System
(CalPERS), which suffered a fall of 4.5 percent.
 ""We are long-term investors so we won't react too sensitively
when looking at our investment results for a single quarter,""
Nobusuke Tamaki, a director-general at GPIF, told a news
conference.
 In value terms, GPIF's performance translated to a loss of
3.59 trillion yen ($42 billion) in April-June, against a profit
of 1.55 trillion yen the previous quarter. Total assets fell 5
percent to 116.8 trillion yen.
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock average fell 15.4 percent
during the quarter, while the yen strengthened 5.3 percent
against the dollar and 14.3 percent on the euro, setting a tough
environment for the pension fund.
 While faring better than CalPERS, GPIF fell short of some
other counterparts such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, which had a negative return of 1.3 percent, despite its
relatively heavy weighting in equities at about 60 percent of
assets.
 GPIF, which invests the reserves of national and corporate
pension plans, allocates about 20 percent of its assets to
domestic and foreign stocks, and most of the rest in the JGB
market, where the benchmark 10-year bond yields around 1 percent.
 The weak performance in the latest quarter underscores the
broad impact of the yen's strength on the Japanese economy and
the challenges facing the country's pension system as the
population rapidly ages.
 In the April-June quarter, GPIF's investment in domestic
bonds produced a positive return of 2.29 percent, or a 1.42
trillion yen profit, somewhat offsetting losses in domestic and
overseas stocks and foreign bonds.
 GPIF took the biggest hit from foreign equities, posting a
negative return of 17.43 percent, or a 2.26 trillion yen loss.
 It lost 13.93 percent, or 2.05 trillion yen, on Japanese
stocks, and 7.51 percent, or 761.7 billion yen, on foreign bonds.
 GPIF had recorded a positive return of 7.91 percent for the
fiscal year that ended in March, a rebound from the record
decline of 10.03 percent the previous year during the financial
crisis.
 GPIF's rate of return on market investments, which excludes
the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP), was minus 3.61
percent, or a 3.66 trillion yen loss in April-June.

 * Government offers 8 percent wage hike, source says
 * Deal would strain budget, may cause tax rise, analyst

(Recasts with new offer)
 By Peroshni Govender and Jon Herkovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - South Africa's government
increased its wage raise offer to unions representing 1.3
million striking state workers, a source said on Monday, trying
to end a strike that threatens Africa's largest economy.
 The offer came in talks arranged after President Jacob
Zuma's ordered ministers to negotiate immediately to end the
nearly three-week-long walkout that has closed schools,
prevented treatment at hospitals and harmed investor sentiment.
 The government increased its offer for a wage increase to 8
percent from 7 percent and raised its offer for a monthly
housing allowance to 800 rand ($108.6) from 700 rand, a union
source close to the talk told Reuters.
 The source said unions would likely look favourably on the
offer, saying ""the strike will be over.""
 Government spokesman Themba Maseko said he could not comment
on whether the offer had been made. 
 Unions have been demanding 8.6 percent and 1,000 rand. Even
if the government raised its offer to something more palatable,
the unions are unlikely to respond quickly as they would need to
consult their rank and file members. 
 The government and unions were still in negotiations that
could end early on Tuesday, officials said.
 Public Service Minister Richard Baloyi said in a statement
prior to negotiations that the government was bringing a new
offer to the table, without offering details.
So far, the government has said it cannot afford the demand
for increases of more than double inflation to end the strike,
which threatens to spread across the economy.

 Zuma's spokesman said the president was particularly
concerned about the strike's impact on health and education.
 ""The president's view is that the strike must end as soon as
possible, in the next couple of days,"" Zizi Kodwa said, adding
that Zuma had spoken to government ministers at the weekend to
tell them to resume talks.
 South Africa's biggest strike since 2007 in terms of lost
man days has left bonds, stocks and the rand largely unaffected,
but market players said the strike would cap gains by the rand
and could have a bigger impact if it drags on.
 
 BUDGET CONCERNS
 Analysts expect Zuma and the African National Congress
government, which has typically given in to labour's demands, to
reach a deal soon, tilted in favour of the unions, and worry
later about the damage to state spending.
 ""Politically, this is beneficial for Zuma because he is in a
tight spot with the unions at the moment,"" said Susan Booysen, a
political analyst at Wits University.
 ""The country already has a high deficit. The rise may result
in higher taxes as the government tries to balance its books.""
 The strike has deepened a rift in the ruling alliance
between Zuma's ruling ANC and the country's largest labour
federation COSATU, which helped bring him to power but is
disappointed with him not advancing left-leaning policies.
 The continent's biggest economy has been hit by a series of
strikes in the private and public sectors in the past few
months, which have led to above-inflation settlements.
 In other disputes, workers at miner Exxaro  have
rejected an 8 percent raise and another strike at a Rio
Tinto-BHP Billiton   titanium joint venture saw
operations shut down on Monday. [ID:nLDE67T15Y] 
 COSATU has threatened to widen the strike this week to all
its member unions who it says represent about 2 million workers.
 Workers in industries including mining will stage a one-day
walk out on Thursday with COSATU threatening a prolonged labour
action that could bring the economy to a halt unless a
settlement is reached in the state workers' strike.
 South Africa is the world's fourth largest gold producer and
largest platinum producer, with mines turning out about 488 kg
(1,076 lb) of gold and 385 kg of platinum a day. 
 The country's biggest firms, such as Anglo Platinum
, Impala Platinum  and Harmony Gold Mining
, have stockpiles of the precious metal and would not be
hard-hit if it was a one-day work stoppage.
 Any agreement to end the dispute is likely to swell state
spending by about 1 to 2 percent, forcing the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.

 * Trial to study drug in stable coronary artery disease

 * Drug could be filed for approval late 2014
 
(Adds comment from doctors, Portola CEO, details)
 By Ben Hirschler
 STOCKHOLM, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Elinogrel, an experimental
blood thinner being developed by Novartis and Portola
Pharmaceuticals, is to move into final-stage clinical testing
following promising Phase II results.
 The new drug targets a market dominated by Sanofi-Aventis
and Bristol-Myers Squibb's $9.5 billion-a-year blockbuster
Plavix, or clopidogrel. Its backers say it has clinical
advantages over Plavix and newer rivals.
 Researcher Sunil Rao from the U.S. Duke Clinical Research
Institute said on Monday tests showed elinogrel was more potent
than Plavix, in both its intravenous and oral forms, without
causing significantly increased bleeding risks.
 The results of the Phase II trial, involving 652 patients
undergoing non-urgent intervention to open clogged arteries,
were presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in
Stockholm.
 Elinogrel's potential will now be tested in a 24,000-patient
Phase III trial that Novartis is expected to initiate in the
first quarter of 2011.
 That trial will assess two different doses of elinogrel
given with aspirin in patients with stable coronary heart
disease, compared to aspirin alone, and will last for a average
29 months. If all goes well, the drug could therefore be filed
for approval around late 2014.
 Rao said the side effects of elinogrel were acceptable for
the move into pivotal Phase III testing. Some patients suffered
mild and transient dyspnea, or shortness of breath, and some had
a temporary increase in liver enzymes, which resolved even when
treatment was continued.
 
 MORE TRIALS PLANNED
 Portola Chief Executive William Lis told Reuters that
further large clinical trials would also be conducted in
patients suffering acute coronary syndrome and those having
artery-opening procedures.
 Final plans for those clinical trials have not yet been
concluded but Lis did not rule out that elinogrel might be
tested head-to-head against AstraZeneca's new drug Brilinta, or
ticagrelor, which has proved superior to Plavix.
 It is in the acute setting that elinogrel could display a
key advantage since, unlike rivals, it can been given
intravenously as well as a tablet.
 ""Where (Eli Lilly's) prasugrel was an advance over
clopidogrel, but with excess bleeding, and ticagrelor was an
advance over prasugrel ... we hope to advance things one step
further,"" Lis said.
 With Plavix already off patent in parts of Europe and set to
lose U.S. patent protection in 2012, companies are jostling to
promote the advantages of newer, follow-up drugs. All are
designed to prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping
together to form clots.
 Doctors said the rapid reversability of elinogrel and its
availability in intravenous form was attractive, since this
meant it took effect very quickly and its blood-thinning effects
could be quickly reversed if patients need major surgery.
 ""This is definitely worth pursuing,"" said Douglas Weaver of
the Henry Ford Heart and Vascular Institute in Detroit, a
spokesman for the American College of Cardiology who was not
involved in the study.
 ""There is a niche for an IV (intravenous) drug that could be
stopped and this one is great in that it is both an IV and an
oral formulation, so you can stay on same drug the whole time.""
 Another blood thinner given intravenously, the Medicines
Co's cangrelor, failed in a late-stage clinical study last year.
 Novartis shares rose 1.3 percent by 0839 GMT while the STOXX
600 health care index gained 0.7 percent.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The yen rose against the dollar
on Monday after the Bank of Japan failed to signal aggressive
measures to curb yen strength at an emergency meeting, choosing
only to expanded a fixed-rate fund supply scheme.
 The central bank's moves were seen by investors as a
symbolic gesture that will do little to halt the currency's
climb which is hurting exports and may prolong deflation.
 The yen gained further after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa said policy steps will not be bound by moves in the
yen and stocks and that the current rise in the yen was due to
investor risk aversion.
 This encouraged investors to add to long yen positions as
the comments were seen as an indication that FX intervention was
not imminent. 
 ""Shirakawa is indicating they are not ready to intervene to
weaken the yen and that's why we are seeing a higher yen as a
result,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea
in Copenhagen.
 ""People are once again putting on short dollar/yen
positions, having reduced their long exposure ahead of the
meeting"".
 At 0805 GMT, the dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen
at 85.00 yen, having hit a low of 84.91 yen, well below a high
of around 85.90 yen hit earlier on jitters before the BOJ's
decision was announced.
 Traders said falls in dollar/yen were limited, however, with
support seen around 84.80 yen.
 The euro, which had risen as high as 109.56 yen earlier,
shed its gains and was down 0.5 percent on the day at 108.17
yen.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar dipped 0.1
percent to 82.872. The euro was down 0.3 percent against the
dollar at $1.2726, though it stayed well above a low just below
$1.26 hit last week.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday
the economic recovery has weakened more than expected and the
Fed stands ready to act if needed to spur slowing growth.
 
 LONG YEN POSITIONS INCREASE
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
investors increased long positions in the yen and the Swiss
franc in the week to Aug. 24 as worries about a slowing global
economy encourage investors to seek perceived safe haven
currencies.
 Market players expect the yen to rise to a new 15-year high
against the dollar if expectations mount that the Federal
Reserve will act to spur growth down the road.
 ""Bernanke's speech has clearly demonstrated that the U.S.
now has an easing bias. Their easing could be more aggressive
than the BOJ's,"" said Minori Uchida, a senior analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo.
 The dollar slid last week to a 15-year low of 83.58 yen on
trading platform EBS, hurt by worries the U.S. economy may fall
into a double-dip recession and falls in U.S. Treasury yields,
as well as market perceptions the Fed is more willing to take
aggressive monetary easing steps than the BOJ.
 Sterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.5561, supported after
better-than-expected UK economic growth numbers on Friday.
 Trade was subdued, however, with UK markets closed for a

 Last week, the economy ministry issued a new 2011-2013
forecasts that show more optimistic growth prospects, but also
higher inflation next year of between 6-7 percent, against
earlier estimates of 5.5-6.5 percent [nLDE63S1W5].
 The rouble's exchange predicted rates have also been revised
to show the currency will stay weaker than 30 roubles per dollar
in the next three years, compared to 30.66 currently.
 ""It will likely stay at the current level, in relation of
dollar to the rouble at the level of 30 roubles (per dollar),""
Kudrin said.
 He also added that the current benchmark refinancing
interest rate fits market conditions and should not be changed. 
 The central bank is expected to make a decision on the refi
rate -- currently at a historic low of 7.75 percent on an
annualised basis -- on Tuesday.
 Kudrin also agreed with economy ministry estimates that the
summer's drought and wildfires are likely to eat into growth of
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by around 1
percentage point.
 ""The contribution of agricultural production to GDP growth
in the second half is usually significant,"" he said. ""This year
it will be smaller than we expect.""
 The new forecast from the Economy Ministry will have a small
impact on budget parameters compared to previous forecasts made
several months ago, before the drought had taken effect, Kudrin
said.
 ""Revenues will be a bit higher,"" he said. 
 He added that the higher revenue could enable to cut budget
deficit, but for now the ministry is going to leave the deficit
estimates unchanged.
 ""We're not going to spend this revenue. We are going to put
as reserves for the future,"" Kudrin said.

 NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Will India's government
succeed in passing key pro-market bills that have been in limbo
for years? Not in the near future, say analysts.
 With state elections around the corner, the Congress-led
government may have lost a political window to push through
crucial economic reforms because of fears of a backlash to
sensitive decisions from voters already reeling from high
prices.
 But while reforms may take longer to enact, the government
is committed to making them happen, and investors, for now, are
putting up with the slow pace to reap the dividends from a vast
consumer market in Asia's third-biggest economy.
 So far, the government's boldest pro-market move has been
to ease state controls on fuel prices, but it has made little
headway in opening up pension and insurance, or liberalising
the retail and financial sectors because of opposition
protests.
 ""The general consensus is that there is a lack of momentum
on passing any of these bills except for nuclear liability ...
because Congress party is not very clear on direction,"" Pratap
Bhanu Mehta, president of the Centre for Policy Research, said.
 A victory last year freed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
from his communist allies and raised hopes for reforms. But
progress has been patchy as the government stumbled from crisis
to crisis.
 But even with this sluggish progress, India attracted
nearly $35 billion in foreign direct investment in 2009,
equivalent to 2.7 percent of its $1.29 trillion GDP.
 China's FDI totalled $95 billion in that year, or 1.9
percent of its $4.9 trillion GDP.
 As the current session of parliament nears its end on Aug.
31, the government has only pushed through legislation on
opening up the $150-billion nuclear power market crucial for
the entry of firms such as U.S.-based General Electric and
Westinghouse Electric, a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp.
 A bill to simplify archaic direct tax laws, a key piece of
reform aimed at widening the tax net and increasing state
revenues, may also be approved by parliament in this session.
 But several other reform bills are unlikely to make it
through with most of the session lost in the government
defending itself against opposition attacks over issues like
high prices.
 High prices were blamed for the ruling party's poor showing
in local elections in the left bastion state of West Bengal.
While inflation has since eased, food prices are still high,
and party leaders will be wary of backing any measure that may
further antagonise supporters.
 LACK OF POLITICAL CONSENSUS
 Among the moves that may be delayed due to a lack of
consensus are India's most ambitious indirect tax reform, the
proposed nationwide GST, and a proposed food security bill.
 The GST proposal has been opposed by the Hindu-nationalist
BJP and some states, who worry about the loss of their fiscal
powers, and some analysts say this could delay the
implementation of the reform beyond the targeted April 1, 2011.
 Some reforms do not need legislation and can be pushed
through an executive order, such as opening up the retail
sector which is on hold because of opposition pressure.
 The thorny issue of land acquisition for industrial
purposes will also be on the backburner until the polls to
avoid antagonising farmers protesting over low compensation.
 The Congress-led government has a slim majority in the
lower house, but not in the upper house. The coalition is also
composed of several small parties often suspicious of reforms,
making the passage of bills subject to torturous negotiations.
 If not passed, the bills can be taken up in the winter
session, around November, but the pending state polls from the
end of the year could narrow the political window.
 State elections begin around November in eastern Bihar
state followed by polls in the states of West Bengal and Kerala
where the Congress party is trying to dislodge communist
governments. There are six state elections over the next year.
 SOME HEADWAY
 The government, nonetheless, has made headway in some
areas: it has pledged to sell stakes in some 60 state-run firms
and formed an experts panel to ease foreign investment in the
financial sector.
 Despite setbacks and halting pace of reforms, accelerating
growth, an expanding domestic consumer base and hopes for
eventual liberalisation will keep foreign funds flowing in.
 Asia's third-largest economy clocks the second-fastest rate
of economic expansion among the major economies in the world
and growth is set to accelerate.
 But the government still needs to speed up the pace of
reforms to deal with two of its biggest economic headaches:
stubbornly high inflation and a massive fiscal deficit.
 Headline inflation has been in double digits for several
months though in July it eased to just below the 10 percent
mark. The fiscal deficit was 6.9 percent of GDP in the last
financial year and the government is aiming at 5.5 percent this
year.
 ""The Indian National Congress-led governing coalition has a
strong political mandate and appears to have enough dexterity
to ensure the passage of key reforms,"" Moody's said in its
latest credit analysis report on India.
 ""Parliamentary debate, state elections, and local issues
may slow policy and reform implementation, but are unlikely to
derail it,"" the investment analysts added.

 * FX and stock market disappointed by BOJ decision
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The yen pared broad losses on
Monday as the Bank of Japan's decision to expand a fixed rate
fund supply scheme disappointed investors who were looking for
more aggressive measures to fight deflation.
 Following an emergency policy meeting, the BOJ said it would
increase the volume of funds to be offered in its fixed-rate fund
supply operation to 30 trillion yen ($351.4 billion) from 20
trillion yen.
 The BOJ also said it would offer fixed-rate loans to banks
with a maturity of six months, adding that it would keep its
overnight call rate target unchanged at 0.1 percent.
 ""The additional easing measures announced by the BOJ were
only in line with market expectations and fuelled dollar-selling
due to disappointment,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist for Japan at Barclays Capital.
 If BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, in a news conference later
on Monday, points to the possibility of shifting toward
quantitative easing via steps such as increasing the amount of
banks' current account balances at the BOJ, the market reaction
may change, but that seems extremely unlikely at this point,
Yamamoto said.
 The dollar pared its gains against the yen and last stood at
85.38 yen, up 0.2 percent on the day but down from around 85.90
yen just before the BOJ's decision was announced.
 The dollar slid to a 15-year low of 83.58 yen on trading
platform EBS last week, hurt by worries that the U.S. economy may
fall into a double-dip recession and falls in U.S. Treasury
yields, as well as a market perception that the U.S. Federal
Reserve was more willing to take aggressive monetary easing steps
compared to the BOJ.
 The euro, which had risen to as high as 109.56 yen earlier,
shed its gains and was little changed on the day at 108.78 yen.
 Against the dollar, the euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.2739.

 HONG KONG, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The yen rose and Japanese
shares gave up some of their strong early gains on Monday after
the Bank of Japan made only minor tweaks in policy,
disappointing markets looking for more aggressive action
against deflation.
 In an emergency meeting, Japan's central bank voted to
expand its cheap fixed-rate loan programme for banks, but
stopped short of bolder steps to stem a rise in the yen that
has threatened the country's already fragile economic recovery.
 Leading European shares rose for a third straight session,

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke downplayed concerns that
the slowing U.S. economy might slip back into recession.
 S&P 500 futures rose 0.4 percent, pointing to a stronger

 Tokyo's Nikkei ended up 1.8 percent after rising more than
3 percent before the BOJ announcement, while Japanese
government bonds pulled back sharply from their intraday lows.
 Asian stocks outside Japan rose 1.3 percent.
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central
bank needs to carefully examine the drawbacks when considering
already low interest rate but did not rule out any specific
policy option in case the economy worsens.
 The strengthening Japanese currency, which hit a 15-year
high of 83.58 yen against the dollar last week, has taken its
toll on the country's exporters, pushing the Nikkei down nearly
20 percent since its peak in early April.
 The yen firmed against the dollar after the BOJ's move,
which was seen by investors as a symbolic gesture that would do
little to halt the currency's climb and may prolong deflation.
 At 0700 GMT the dollar was hovering around 85 yen from
around 85.88 yen just before the BOJ announcement. The euro
slid to 108.23 yen from around 109.49 yen beforehand.
 ""If the BOJ really wanted to do something about the
strength of the yen, they should have done something about
deflationary pressures. The current policy of doing nothing
simply isn't working,"" said Robert Rennie, currency strategist
at Westpac in Sydney.
 Global investors will continue to focus this week on the
U.S. economy's flagging momentum, with a slew of economic data
from Washington including August payroll figures expected to
add to the gloomy outlook.
 Even if the U.S. economy does avoid a ""double-dip""
recession, investors fear growth could effectively stall,
making companies and consumers even more cautious about fresh
spending.

to release July personal income and consumption data which is
expected to show a rise of 0.3 percent in both income and

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The yen slipped broadly on Monday
as investors braced for possible monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan to help curb the yen's strength against the dollar.
 The yen came under pressure after the BOJ called an emergency
policy meeting, saying its nine-member board will meet from 0000
GMT. BOJ Governor Shirakawa will hold a news conference at 0530
GMT, the central bank added.
 Sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking have said the most
likely easing option the BOJ may consider is to expand a cheap
fixed-rate loan programme for banks, although any such move is
already widely expected and may not weaken the yen for long.
 The yen's rise to a 15-year peak against the dollar last week
slammed Tokyo shares and threatened to add to deflationary
pressure on Japan's economy, stirring market speculation about
BOJ monetary easing as well as yen-selling intervention by
Japanese authorities.
 After the BOJ called an emergency policy meeting last
December the dollar rose around 9 percent against the yen in
about a month, and some traders may be looking for the dollar to
rebound against the yen this time as well, said Tohru Sasaki,
head of Japan rates and FX research at JPMorgan Chase Bank.
 But since the biggest reasons behind the yen's rise in the
past few months are concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy
and fiscal woes in the euro zone, the impact from any possible
BOJ easing is likely to be limited, he said.
 That is likely to hold true even if the BOJ were to take more
aggressive steps such as increasing government bond purchases or
cutting its overnight rate call target from the current 0.1
percent, Sasaki said.
 ""Such steps would be a surprise so the yen might weaken one
yen more (against the dollar) than would otherwise be the case,""
Sasaki said, but added that the overall impact was likely to be
subdued.
 The dollar hit an intraday high of 85.75 yen on trading
platform EBS on news of the BOJ's emergency meeting, rising from
around 85.35 yen.
 But it later trimmed some of its gains to stand at 85.59 yen,
up 0.4 percent from late U.S. trading on Friday.
 The dollar hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen last week.
 The euro rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 109.15 yen,
having pulled up from a nine-year low of 105.44 yen struck last
week.
 Against the dollar, the euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.2753.

 By Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely to hold
an emergency meeting on Monday to ease monetary policy in
response to the yen's strength after Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
returned to Tokyo from a trip to the United States earlier than
expected.
 Sources had told Reuters that the BOJ was expected to hold an
extra meeting early in the week to loosen policy as the strong
yen threatens Japan's fragile economic recovery. The early return
of Shirakawa, who was originally expected to come back on Monday,
has increased the chance of a Monday gathering.
 The most likely option is to expand a cheap fixed-rate fund
supply programme put in place in December, said sources familiar
with the BOJ's thinking.
 But there is a slim possibility the BOJ could opt for more
aggressive measures, such as increasing its government bond
purchases or cutting its overnight call rate target, as some
government officials are already complaining that minor tweaks to
the fund supply scheme would not be enough.
 The BOJ has been considering easing policy, but had initially
hoped to wait until its Sept. 6-7 rate review for more evidence
of the harm the strong yen was inflicting on business sentiment.
 But the yen's climb to a fresh 15-year high on the dollar
last week and a slide in stock prices have alarmed some in the
BOJ into considering action. The BOJ has also been under
increasing government pressure to ease policy.
 Following are some policy options for the BOJ:
 EXPAND FUND SUPPLY TOOL
 Possibility: Most likely
 The BOJ set up a funding scheme in December that it expanded
in March, which offered up to 20 trillion yen ($234 billion) in
three-month loans at 0.1 percent. The decision to set up the
scheme was made at an emergency meeting held a day before
Shirakawa met with then-Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama.
 That failed to boost bank lending, which marked its eighth
straight month of annual falls in July. But it helped to push the
yen further away from a November high.
 Increasing the amount of funds available, or extending the
duration of loans to six months, could push down interbank
lending rates and indirectly weaken the yen, analysts say.
 Sceptics at the BOJ argue that the yen's drivers are
different now than they were in December. Investors now view the
yen more as a safe haven and are not focusing on short-term
interest rate differentials like they were in December.
Therefore, lowering money market rates this time might not have
the impact it had in December.
 ""It's an option but it won't work both in terms of affecting
currency moves and supporting the economy,"" said a source
familiar with the BOJ's thinking.
 Still, it is among the favoured options within the BOJ as it
is easier to implement than other more aggressive measures.
 The move would be more of a token gesture to show the central
bank was doing what it could to support the economy.
 Market reaction: It would have little impact on money market
rates and the yen, as such a move is already widely expected in
the markets.
 BUY MORE GOVERNMENT BONDS, ASSETS
 Possibility: Less Likely
 This is a less attractive option for the BOJ, which worries
that increasing government bond purchases from current levels of
21.6 trillion yen per year could give the impression it was
directly financing government spending.
 But it would surprise markets and please the government,
which may not be satisfied with the widely expected move of
expanding the BOJ's fund supply scheme.
 Although 10-year bond yields have already dipped below 1.0
percent, buying more bonds could be a more effective way to
support growth as long-term yields still have room to fall.
 Additional buying could also weaken the yen by showing
markets its determination to expand fund supply, analysts say.
 Market reaction: Bond yields might briefly fall, subsequently
pushing down the yen. But there could be a danger of yields
rising if markets felt Japan was losing control over its debt.
 STRENGTHEN COMMITMENT TO EASY POLICY
 Possibility: Unlikely
 If the government steps up pressure on the BOJ to ease policy
further it may cave in to lawmakers' calls to set a more rigid
inflation target and commit itself to do more to beat deflation.
 But this is unlikely for now, as Shirakawa is against setting
a strict price target for fear of binding future monetary policy,
BOJ officials say.
 The BOJ may instead opt for a vaguer commitment, such as
pledging to keep rates low until Japan is comfortably out of
deflation. The Federal Reserve's stated commitment to keep rates
low for an ""extended period"" could be an example, analysts say.
 The challenge would be to make the pledge clear enough to be
effective but vague enough to leave policy options open.
 Market reaction: Two-year bond yields, most sensitive to
monetary policy, might fall. But the move could be short-lived as
such a commitment is effective when markets are starting to
factor in the chance of a rate hike, which is not the case now.
 REVERT TO QUANTITATIVE EASING, ZERO RATES
 Possibility: Highly unlikely
 The BOJ already floods markets with cash as it did during its
five-year quantitative easing policy until 2006. It now targets
interest rates, whereas under its quantitative easing policy it
targeted liquidity.
 But it is strongly against reverting to a formal quantitative
easing policy with a liquidity target, as it feels the policy did
little to boost the economy or beat deflation.
 Achieving a liquidity target would also be tougher now as
banks are in less need of funds than they were a decade ago, when
Japan was mired in a severe credit crunch, BOJ officials say.
 Cutting the policy rate to zero from 0.1 percent is also
among the least favoured options, as it would discourage banks
from trading in the money market and make it hard for the BOJ to
guide short-term rates.
 But the BOJ may opt to set a range of zero to 0.1 percent as
its new policy target if it feels expanding its fund supply tool
could push down overnight rates well below 0.1 percent.
 Market reaction: The shift would come as a surprise and
sharply push down money market rates, bond yields and the yen.

 By Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely to hold
an emergency meeting on Monday to ease monetary policy after
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa returned to Tokyo from a trip to the
United States earlier than expected.
 Sources had told Reuters that the BOJ was expected to hold an
extra meeting early in the week to loosen policy as the strong
yen threatens Japan's fragile economic recovery, and Shirakawa's
early return has increased the chance of a Monday gathering.
 The central bank's most likely option is to expand a fund
supply programme put in place in December, through which it
offers up to 20 trillion yen ($234 billion) in three-month loans
to banks at the policy rate of 0.1 percent, said sources familiar
with the BOJ's thinking.
 But there is a slim possibility the BOJ will opt for more
aggressive measures, such as increasing its government bond
purchases or cutting its overnight call rate target, as some
government officials are already complaining that minor tweaks to
the fund supply scheme would not be enough.
 The BOJ said Shirakawa arrived back in Tokyo from the United
States on Sunday afternoon, earlier than planned, but did not
comment on whether it would hold an emergency meeting on Monday.
 ""The governor's schedule at the conference (in Jackson Hole)
was flexible in the first place. We understand that the governor
himself made the decision to change his schedule,"" Satoshi
Yamaguchi, head of the BOJ's media relations division, told
Reuters.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said last week that he wanted to
meet Shirakawa as soon as he returns from his trip to the United
States, and request a ""flexible"" monetary policy response to the
strong yen.
 Shirakawa will meet with Kan on Monday to discuss economic
and market developments, public broadcaster NHK said.
 The BOJ would likely try to ease policy before the two meet
to avoid giving markets the impression it yielded to government
pressure, analysts say.
 The BOJ has been considering easing policy, but had initially
hoped to wait until its regular rate review on Sept. 6-7 for more
evidence of the damage the strong yen was inflicting on business
sentiment.
 But the yen's climb to a fresh 15-year high on the dollar
last week and a slide in stock prices have alarmed some in the
BOJ into considering action. The central bank has also been under
increasing government pressure to ease policy.
 Shirakawa had travelled to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to attend a
central bankers' gathering and was originally expected to return
to Japan on Monday.

 * Tyre workers announce strike from Monday
 * COSATU leader says ""no problem"" with Zuma

(Adds quotes from COSATU officials)
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 29 (Reuters) - A powerful South African
labour leader threatened at the weekend to withdraw support for
President Jacob Zuma's African National Congress, altering a
long alliance strained by a nearly three-week-old strike.
 Adding to the pressure on the government, a union
representing tyre makers announced a strike for higher wages
from Monday. Thousands of armed forces unionised members are
also thinking of striking.
 The government and unions have opened a new round of wage
negotiations to end the dispute that has shut schools and
prevented treatment of the sick, broadcaster eNews reported
unnamed sources as saying.
 This month's strike by about 1.3 million state workers,
including teachers, nurses, customs officers and government
clerks has presented Zuma with one of his most serious
challenges since taking office more than a year ago.
 Unions, also upset by alleged corruption in the ANC, are
trying to link the labour action to Zuma's political fortunes.
 ""We will not make a mistake again of voting into power our
worst political butchers,"" COSATU Secretary-General Zwelinzima
Vavi said at a rally on Saturday.
 The comments, refering to ANC candidates for local elections
next year, were broadcast nationwide on Sunday.
 Vavi later told Reuters that his group still supported South
Africa's president: ""There is no problem with Zuma. We interact
with him all the time.""
 Vavi last week said the alliance with the ANC was
dysfunctional and in danger of collapse.. But COSATU spokesman
Patrick Craven said he did not see a breakdown coming.
 ""We are no where near the stage ... of withdrawing our
support for the ANC,"" Craven told Reuters.
 COSATU helped Zuma win the presidency and its support is
essential if he wants to seek re-election. Vavi last week said
the alliance with the ANC forged in the struggle to end
apartheid was on the verge of rupture. 
 COSATU has already threatened to widen the state workers'
strike later this week to all of its member unions who it says
represent about 2 million workers.
 A one-day strike set for Thursday will probably not do much
economic damage but COSATU has said the action could turn into
an indefinite strike, which would cause major damage in
industries including mining, which alone is responsible for
about 5 to 6 percent of GDP.
 Analysts expect Zuma and the ANC government, which has
typically given in to labour's demands, to reach a deal soon,
tilted in favour of the unions, and worry later about the damage
to state spending.
 
 ANC MEETING
 ""It wouldn't surprise me if there was some sort of
resolution by the end of the week,"" labour analyst Tony Healy
told Talk Radio 702.
 An expanded strike would add to worries about prospects for
growth after the economy slowed more than expected in the second
quarter of 2010 as mining contracted and manufacturing expanded
at a slower pace. 
 The government has said it cannot afford the state workers'
demand of an 8.6 percent wage rise, more than double the
inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($135.8) a month as a housing
allowance. It has offered 7 percent and 700 rand.
 Any agreement to end the dispute is likely to swell state
spending by about 1 to 2 percent, forcing the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 ""Put simply, government will be borrowing money to pay wages
and debt service costs. This is not only unsustainable but will
require future generations to pay for our current spending,""
government spokesman Themba Maseko said in a report.
 Bond, stock and rand trading have mostly been unaffected by
the strike but market players said that could change if there is
no deal by the end of the week and if the strike widens to
industries which could hurt local shares and dent sentiment.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2010 09:44AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Czech cbanker sees rate hike to 1 pct by early 2011," * C.banker Holman sees 25 bps rise by early 2011
 * Expects low rates next year
 * Third member of 7-strong board to advocate rate rise

(Adds details)
 PRAGUE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank will
likely raise the main interest rate by 25 basis points at the
end of this year or in early 2011, central banker Robert Holman
was quoted as saying on Sunday.
 Holman was the third member of the bank's seven-strong
governing board to advocate higher rates in the past week,
diverging from the bank's August quarterly forecast assuming a
flat market, and thus also official interest rates, until a
gradual rise in the second half of 2011.
 Czech interest rates are at an all time low, with the main
two-week repurchase rate at 0.75 percent, after eight cuts of
varying size made since August 2008.
 Czechs have the lowest borrowing costs in the region and
below the European central bank's benchmark rate of 1 percent.
 ""I think interest rates will be at low levels next year,""
the weekly magazine Tyden quoted Holman as saying on its website
in an excerpt from an interview to be released on Monday.
 ""I think in the end we will raise rates to 1 percent. (But)
I do not know whether this will happen at the end of this year,
or the beginning of the next year.""
 A newcomer on the bank's governing board Kamil Janacek said
on Thursday the period of low rates was over and he expected a
debate about a hike in the fourth quarter.
 Board member Eva Zamarzilova said she wanted a rate hike
debate ""very soon"".
 The bank targets CPI and has assessed risks to its latest
inflation forecast from Aug. 5 as moderately disinflationary,
pointing to planned government fiscal austerity and the firming
of the crown. 
 Governor Miroslav Singer said after the last rate-setting
meeting the bank expected a protracted period of stability in
market rates with tightening no sooner than in the middle of
2011.
 The development of the three-month interbank rate PRIBOR
forecast by the bank closely correlates with the main policy
rate, the repo rate.
 The bank next meets on rates on Sept. 23.

government is in the lead ahead of next month's parliamentary
election and would have just enough support to form a majority
government, an opinion poll showed on Sunday.
 The SVD/Sifo poll showed Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's
four-party ""Alliance"" winning 50 percent of the vote in the
Sept. 19 ballot, against 43.3 percent for the centre-left
opposition led by Social Democrat leader Mona Sahlin.
 The survey of 1,420 voters showed the far-right Sweden
Democrats, who promote an anti-immigrant agenda, would win their
first seats in parliament but would not hold the balance of
power because of the government's strong showing.
 Most political analysts believe the election is still too
close to call, not least since several smaller parties of the
right and left, as well as the Sweden Democrats, are polling
close to the 4 percent minimum needed to win seats in
parliament.
 Both the Moderate-led government and the centre-left
opposition have ruled out cooperating with the Sweden Democrats.

 * Analysts say deal coming soon despite mounting pressure
 * Tyre workers announce strike from Monday
 
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 29 (Reuters) - A powerful South African
labour leader threatened on Sunday to withdraw support for
President Jacob Zuma's African National Congress, ending a long-
standing alliance strained by a nearly three-week-old strike.
 Adding to the pressure, a union representing tyre makers
announced a strike for higher wages from Monday. Thousands of
armed forces unionised members are also thinking of striking.
 This month's strike by about 1.3 million state workers has
presented Zuma with one of his most serious challenges since
taking office more than a year ago, with unions trying to link
the labour action to Zuma's political future.
 ""We will not make a mistake again of voting into power our
worst political butchers,"" COSATU Secretary-General Zwelinzima
Vavi said at a rally.
 COSATU helped Zuma win the presidency and its support is
essential if he wants to seek re-election. Vavi last week said
the alliance with the ANC forged in the struggle to end
apartheid was on the verge of rupture.
 COSATU has already threatened to widen the state
workers' strike later this week to all of its member unions who
it says represent about 2 million workers.
 A one-day strike set for Thursday will probably not do much
economic damage but COSATU has said the action could turn into
an indefinite strike, which would cause major damage in
industries including mining, which alone is responsible for
about 5 to 6 percent of GDP.
 Analysts expect Zuma and the ANC government, which has
typically given in to labour's demands, to reach a deal soon,
tilted in favour of the unions, and worry later about the damage
to state spending.
 
 ANC MEETING
 Zuma also does not want to have the dispute hanging over him
heading into an ANC policy-setting meeting in late September. 
 ""It wouldn't surprise me if there was some sort of
resolution by the end of the week,"" labour analyst Tony Healy
told Talk Radio 702.
 Zuma on Saturday accused striking state workers of
abandoning the sick at hospitals and said he expected a deal to
be reached soon to end the labour action.
 An expanded strike would add to worries about prospects for
growth after the economy slowed more than expected in the second
quarter of 2010 as mining contracted and manufacturing expanded
at a slower pace. 
 The government has said it cannot afford the state workers'
demand of an 8.6 percent wage rise, more than double the
inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($135.8) a month as a housing

spending by about 1 to 2 percent, forcing the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 Bond, stock and rand trading have mostly been unaffected by
the strike but market players said that could change if there is
no deal by the end of the week and if the strike widens to
industries which could hurt local shares and dent sentiment.

 * Euro rises but yen drops on intervention concerns
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday,
as bargain hunters erased early losses sparked by downbeat
remarks on the economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke and a warning of lower revenues by bellwether Intel.
 The combination of the two factors sent stocks reeling and
caused a surge of safe-haven buying of the U.S. dollar. Oil and
gold prices also fell. But those losses proved short-lived.
 The accumulation of gloomy economic data and market losses
for much of August proved too tempting for investors looking to
pick up assets on the cheap.
 For instance, on the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock
index, early losses pulled the overall level down to 1,040, a
key level of technical resistance.
 ""We're sitting on important support and in thin markets you
don't want to be leaning too far in one direction coming into a
very low volume week,"" said Richard Ross, global technical
strategist at Auerbach Grayson in New York.
 ""If you were short the market throughout this month, you
made a nice profit, you want to lock that in.""
 Even U.S. economic data showing a sharp downward revision
in second quarter gross domestic product was less gloomy than
economists expected and underpinned share prices in Europe as
well as on Wall Street. For details, see [ID:nN26193565]
 At the close of trade, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> gained 164.84 points, or 1.65 percent, to 10,150.65. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 17.37 points, or 1.66
percent, to 1,064.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
climbed 34.94 points, or 1.65 percent, to 2,153.63.
 For the week the Dow industrials fell 0.61 percent, the S&P
500 lost 0.66 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 1.19 percent.
 Stocks initially fell after Bernanke said the central bank
was ready to counter a softening recovery, saying
unconventional measures would be considered, but gave no hints
on what the Fed intended to do. [ID:nFEDAHEAD]
 But the Fed chairman downplayed concerns the economy might
slip back into recession, reassuring investors spooked by his
recent comments that the economy faced ""unusual uncertainty.""
 Intel Corp  said third-quarter revenue would be
below its previous outlook, perhaps by as much as $1 billion
due to weaker demand for personal computers. The stock fell
after the forecast, but relief the downward revision wasn't
worse led to end of day share gains of 1.05 percent to $18.37.
[ID:nN27260125]
 Europe's top stocks held gains into the close of trade, but
lost ground for a third straight week. The FTSEurofirst 300
index <.FTEU3> gained 0.6 percent on the day, but slipped 0.27
percent on the week.
 European telecoms performed well, with Vodafone , BT
, Telefonica , Deutsche Telekom  and
France Telecom  rose between 1.9 and 2.8 percent.
 The MSCI All-Country World equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
rose 0.41 percent, off a seven-week low hit earlier this week.
The index is down 2.9 percent so far in August. The Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 0.77 percent.
Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> climbed 1.46 percent.
 CURRENCIES AND DEBT
 The euro recovered against the U.S. dollar following
Bernanke's comments and Intel's report.
 After slipping as low as $1.2676  according to
Reuters data in the initial reaction, the euro traded at
$1.2732, up 0.10 percent.
 The dollar, however, held its gains against the yen, rising
0.90 percent at 85.21 .
 Analysts said the dollar would remain supported against
other safe haven assets because Bernanke gave no firm
commitment the central bank would provide additional easing,
which could put downward pressure on interest rates.
 The yen is under pressure as speculation persisted that
Tokyo might take steps to stem export-damaging strength in the
Japanese currency. The yen is hovering near a 15-year peak of
83.60 against the greenback on safe-haven trade that is choking
off its already slumbering economy.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he would take firm action on
currencies when needed and that he would meet Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa when the central bank chief returns
from the Jackson Hole conference. [ID:nTKZ006504]
The BOJ's policy board is scheduled to hold a regular
two-day meeting starting on Sept. 6, the paper said.
 ""I don't think we'll see intervention around current levels
unless we get a disorderly move where dollar/yen falls sharply,
say by 3 yen, during one day,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at nabCapital.
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell on profit-taking after Bernanke
signaled no imminent bond buying by the central bank.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury  fell 1-14/32
points in price, driving the yield up to 2.65 percent.
 German Bund futures  settled 28 ticks lower to
133.66, with traders saying the market was disappointed that
Bernanke didn't announce any new stimulus measures.
 Crude oil  settled up 2.47 percent to $75.17 per
barrel, and spot gold prices  gained $2.56 to $1,237.50.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2010 04:20PM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-BOJ mulls emergency meeting early next week-source," * Expanding fund-supply tool most likely option - source
 * Increasing JGB buying another possibility but less likely
 * Emergency meeting may be held as early as Tuesday
(Adds details)
 By Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is examining
holding an emergency meeting early next week to ease monetary
policy as the strong yen threatens the country's fragile economic
recovery, a source familiar with the matter said.
 The most likely option is for the central bank to expand its
fund-supply tool put in place in December last year, under which
it offers up to 20 trillion yen ($234 billion) in three-month
loans to banks at 0.1 percent, the source told Reuters.
 Another possibility is for the BOJ to increase its outright
government bond purchases from the current 21.6 trillion yen per
year, although this is less likely due to strong opposition from
some within the BOJ.
 The date of the emergency meeting is yet to be decided and
there is still a chance the BOJ may opt to wait until its regular
policy-setting meeting on Sept. 6-7 to loosen policy, the source
familiar with the central bank's thinking said. The source
declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
 But an emergency meeting may be held as early as Tuesday,
when BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa is back in Tokyo after his
visit to the United States for a central bankers' meeting in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
 Japanese policymakers have tried to talk down the yen and
signalled their readiness to intervene in the currency market
after the yen hit a 15-year high against the dollar on Tuesday,
threatening to derail the economy's export-led recovery.
 The BOJ has been considering easing policy and has been
lining up its options, but had initially hoped to wait until the
September rate review for clearer evidence of the damage the
strong yen was inflicting on business sentiment.
 But recent sharp yen gains and stock price falls, as well as
mounting government pressure, alarmed some in the BOJ enough to
ponder an immediate policy response.
 The government, which is expected to outline its economic
stimulus measures next Tuesday, has heightened pressure on the
central bank to do its part to support growth.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Friday he hoped to meet
Shirakawa as soon as possible after the governor's return from
the United States, and request for a ""flexible"" monetary policy
response to the strong yen.
 The BOJ is expected to examine expanding the size of its
fixed-rate fund supply programme to 30 trillion yen from the
current 20 trillion yen, or extend the duration of cheap loans to
banks to six months from three months.
 Such a step could push down interbank lending rates and
indirectly weaken the yen, although the impact would likely be
limited and short-lived with money market rates already very low.
 The move would therefore be more of a token gesture to show
that the central bank was doing what it could to support the
economy.

 * U.S. GDP data slightly better than expected
 * Yen hurt by caution over possible intervention
(Add details, updates prices)
 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
yen and the Swiss franc on Friday after U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed was prepared to provide
stimulus to boost a U.S. economic recovery that had slowed more
than expected, but did not say how or when.
 Analysts said the dollar would remain supported because
Bernanke gave no firm commitment the central bank would provide
additional easing, which could put downward pressure on
interest rates.
 The Fed also did not make clear what would prompt such
measures, they noted. For details on Bernanke's remarks, see
[ID:nN27259859]
 ""Net-net, all Bernanke said was expected. He didn't change
his position and stopped short of committing to another round
of quantitative easing,"" said Boris Schlossberg, a director of
currency research at GFT Forex, in New York. ""The major
currencies will remain within the trading patterns they had
established before his remarks: the yen is weakening and the
dollar is somewhat supported against the euro.""
 In midafternoon trading in New York, the dollar was up 1.1
percent against the yen  at 85.35 yen after climbing as
high as 85.49 yen, while the euro see-sawed but last traded up
0.1 percent at $1.2733 .
 Comments from European Central Bank Governing Council
member Axel Weber on Friday that Europe is on the brink of a
self-sustaining recovery added to the euro's allure.
[nLDE67Q1NI] 
 The dollar hit a session high earlier against the Swiss
franc at 1.0300 francs  and last traded up 0.4 percent at
1.0277 francs.
 The dollar got a lift earlier in the session after the
government released its revision for second-quarter U.S. GDP
growth, with figures that were slightly better than market
expectations. [ID:nN26193565]
 The GDP report helped push benchmark Treasury yields
higher, boosting the return on U.S.-denominated assets.
Government debt prices extended their earlier losses on
Bernanke's comments.
 The Fed announced plans earlier this month to boost the
flagging economy by reinvesting money from maturing mortgage
bonds in government debt. 
 YEN WARY
 Meanwhile, traders trimmed long positions on the Japanese
currency after a rally earlier this week pushed the yen to its
highest level in 15 years and led Japan's prime minister to
reiterate a threat to take steps to stem its advance.
 A media report that Prime Minister Naoto Kan was to hold a
news conference sparked profit-taking in dollar/yen short
positions, traders said.
 Kan said he would take firm action on currencies when
needed and that he would meet Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa when the central bank chief returns from an overseas
trip. [ID:nTKZ006504]
 Shirakawa traveled to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for the Fed
conference and will return to Tokyo on August 30.
[ID:nTKV006403].
 Analysts and traders said Kan seemed to play down the
prospect of imminent action but they remained wary with the
currency so close to 15-year highs versus the dollar, with the
rapidity of any move in the yen seen as key.
 ""I don't think we'll see intervention around current levels
unless we get a disorderly move where dollar/yen falls sharply,
say by three yen, during one day,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at nabCapital in London.
 Despite the risk of possible action by Japanese authorities
to curb yen strength, such as yen-selling intervention or
monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, some traders and
investors say the yen could still test a record high of 79.75
yen to the dollar, hit in April 1995.
 A buy signal on the dollar against the yen was triggered on
Friday when the 12- and 26-day moving average convergence
divergence line rose above the 9-day signal line. The MACD was
last at -0.67, with the signal line at -0.71.
 The MACD is used in technical analysis as an indicator of
short-term momentum by focusing on exponential moving averages
and closing prices.

 Bernanke's comments at the Jackson Hole symposium of
central bankers and Intel's warning triggered a sharp sell-off
in global shares, and investors piled into the U.S. dollar for
safety, causing oil and gold prices to drop.
 But those losses proved short-lived.
 The accumulation of gloomy economic data and the market
losses for much of August proved too tempting for
short-covering and investors looking to pick up assets on the
cheap.
 Even U.S. economic data showing a sharp downward revision
in second quarter gross domestic product was less gloomy than
economists expected and underpinned share prices in Europe as
well as on Wall Street. For details, see [ID:nN26193565]
 ""(Bernanke) is not saying anything to change the big
picture, and the big picture here is of a continued drip of
grim economic tidings, and the takeaway here is that
unemployment is problem number one,"" said David Dietze, chief
investment strategist at Point View Financial Services in

percent at 84.29 .
 Analysts said the dollar would remain supported against
other safe haven assets because Bernanke gave no firm
commitment the central bank would provide additional easing,
which could put downward pressure on interest rates.
 The yen is under pressure as speculation persisted that
Tokyo might take steps to stem export-damaging strength in the
Japanese currency. The yen is hovering near a 15-year peak of
83.60 against the greenback on safe-haven trade that is choking
off its already slumbering economy.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2010 01:28PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Far right may hold balance after Swedish vote," * Sweden faces parliamentary election on Sept. 19
 * Minority government could unsettle markets
 * Analysts believe negative reaction would be brief
 
 By Niklas Pollard
 STOCKHOLM, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Sweden's election next month
may produce a hung parliament with a far-right party holding the
balance of power, setting the stage for a minority government
and an intense, but brief, period of market volatility.
 Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and his four-party
centre-right coalition is seeking re-election on Sept. 19 and
opinion polls show it faces a close contest with the main
opposition Social Democrat-led centre-left bloc.
 The polls tend to show Reinfeldt leading, but six out of 10
forecast he will not have a majority if the far-right
anti-immigrant Swedish Democrats win their first parliament
seats in a country renowned for its tolerance.
 A minority government would not be a shock in Sweden, which
has been ruled by them for most of the democratic era, but it
would still shake markets.
 ""The halo that to some extent is resting on the Swedish
economy would be knocked slightly askew,"" said Torbjorn
Isaksson, chief analyst at the Nordea bank.
 ""Uncertainty is never good and I think this would feed
through to the market in form of higher debt yields and a weaker
crown.""
 The economic recovery has been stronger in Sweden than
elsewhere in the European Union and the government is
forecasting 4.5 percent growth this year. Its public finances
are also much more robust.
 In such circumstances, the Swedish crown has strengthened
nearly 9 percent against the euro this year while 10-year debt
yields have eased more than 30 percent. If a hung parliament
emerges, the winning streak may fade.
 ""There would be an initial strong negative reaction ahead of
parliamentary negotiations to form a new government and ahead of
the autumn budget,"" Swedbank economist Knut Hallberg said.
 He and SEB chief economist Robert Bergqvist said the scale
of the market reaction would partly depend on how much the
outcome differed from opinion polls in the run-up to the vote
and believe the negative reaction will wear off quickly.
 ""There could be a political vacuum after election night, but
I think this would be filled pretty quickly,"" Bergqvist said.
 ""I think we would see a short-lived market impact somewhat
depending on how fast the issue of forming a new government is
resolved.""
 The crown traded at 9.37 to the euro on Friday while Swedish
benchmark 10-year bond yields stood at 2.219, 11 points above
its German counterpart.
 
 MINORITY GOVERNMENTS BEFORE
 The established parties have said they will not work with
the Sweden Democrats. This means that if Reinfeldt wins but has
no majority in the 349-seat parliament, he will probably form a
minority government.
 This could occur if the Sweden Democrats win at least four
percent of total votes cast, the minimum needed to enter
parliament, which would ensure them about 14 seats.
 Minority government rule in Sweden has mostly been in the
form of Social Democratic cabinets, and in recent years
legislation has been revised to give such governments greater
influence.
 The new rules, introduced after a destabilising political
log-jam during Sweden's economic crisis in the early 1990s, mean
a government's budget is rejected only if the opposition unites
on a comprehensive alternative bill.
 If the Sweden Democrats were isolated, a united opposition
vote against a minority government budget or to push through a
vote of no confidence would be unlikely.
 A second term of majority government for Reinfeldt would
have little effect on money and debt markets, political analysts
said, while a slightly more expansionary centre-left fiscal
policy could put some slight pressure on debt yields and the
crown.
 Indeed, it may not be Swedish politics that pose the main
risk for the country's rosy growth prospects.
 ""The main risk for the Swedish economic outlook is coming
from the euro zone,"" said BNP Paribas economist Gizem Kara,
referring to the fact that export-heavy Sweden derives much
growth from euro zone demand.

 MOSCOW, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Russia has not yet emerged from
economic crisis and the state will continue to implement
anti-crisis measures, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told local
news agencies on Friday.
 ""The Russian economy, just like the world's economy as a
whole, is emerging from the crisis gradually,"" state-run RIA

 ""We believe that we have to continue to implement these

 He also said that a standoff between two powerful tycoons
who each own a 25 percent stake in mining giant Norilsk Nickel
is damaging for the company.
 ""The (plant) is not divided between the owners, but there is
a fight within the shareholding society between the main

277,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2010 12:04PM ET</span>",Canada letter says concerns re EU GM crop proposal," * Canada says EU proposals don't appear to be science-based
 * Ottawa to seek clarification from EU in Sept. 10 talks
 
 BRUSSELS, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Canadian government has
voiced concerns about a European Union proposal to allow member
states to decide whether to ban genetically modified (GM) crops.
 The bloc's executive -- the European Commission -- submitted
the proposal in July in a bid to break a deadlock in EU GM
approvals, with just two products authorised for cultivation
since 1998.
 If approved by EU governments and lawmakers, the plans would
allow member states to ban the growing of GM varieties approved
for cultivation at EU level, provided they use non-scientific
arguments.
 ""Canada is concerned that the EU's proposal does not appear
to be consistent with a science-based approach,"" Ottawa said in
a letter sent to EU government embassies in Brussels and seen by
Reuters.
 In 2004 Canada, the United States and Argentina filed a
complaint against the EU's GM crop policies with the World Trade
Organisation (WTO), arguing that a de facto EU moratorium on new
cultivation approvals between 1999 and 2003 was against global
trade rules.
 The complaint against the EU was largely backed by a WTO
panel in 2006, but last year Canada -- the world's
fourth-largest agricultural exporter -- agreed to settle its
case against the 27-nation bloc.
 As part of the settlement Canada and the Commission
established a regular dialogue on GM issues, and Ottawa said in
the letter it would seek further clarification on the proposals
from the Commission at their next meeting on Sept. 10.
 ""Canada is watching developments in the EU closely,
including discussions on the consistency of the proposal with
the principles of the EU single market,"" added the letter.
 Argentina reached a similar settlement with the EU in March.
 In 2008 the United States began steps to retaliate against
the EU after the bloc failed to comply with the WTO ruling, but
later suspended the action.
 Washington could resume its moves to retaliate if it were to
decide that the EU's current or future policies on GM crops do
not address the complaints upheld by the WTO.

 * U.S. GDP data slightly better than expected
 * Yen hurt by caution over possible intervention
(Adds comments, details)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The dollar traded higher
against the yen and the Swiss franc on Friday after U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed was prepared
to provide stimulus to boost a U.S. economic recovery that had
slowed more than expected, but did not say how or when.
 Analysts said the dollar would remain supported against
other safe haven assets because Bernanke gave no firm
commitment the central bank would provide additional easing,
which could put downward pressure on interest rates.
 The Fed also didn't make clear what would prompt such
measures, they noted. For details on Bernanke's remarks, see
 ""Net-net, all Bernanke said was expected. He didn't change
his position and stopped short of committing to another round
of quantitative easing,"" said Boris Schlossberg, a director of
currency research at GFT Forex, in New York.
 ""Ultimately, his speech produced little light in the FX
market,"" he added. ""The major currencies will remain within the
trading patterns they had established before his remarks: the
yen is weakening and the dollar is somewhat supported against
the euro.""
 In late morning trading in New York, the dollar was up 0.6
percent against the yen at 84.91 yen, while the euro see-sawed
and traded last up 0.2 percent at $1.2750. 
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc and hit
a session high earlier at 1.0300.
 ""Price action will be pretty choppy, but as the day winds
down and people lighten positions, we'll probably settle back
into recent ranges,"" said John Doyle, a senior currency
strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 The dollar got a lift earlier in the session after the
government released its revision for second quarter U.S. GDP
growth, with figures that were slightly better than market
expectations.
 The GDP report helped push benchmark Treasury yields
higher, boosting the return on U.S.-denominated assets.
Government debt prices extended their earlier losses on
Bernanke's comments.
 Friday's comments come after the Fed announced plans
earlier this month to boost a flagging economy by reinvesting
money from maturing mortgage bonds in government debt.
 Meanwhile, traders trimmed long positions on the Japanese
currency after a rally earlier this week pushed the yen to its
highest level in 15 years and led Japan's prime minister to
reiterate a threat to take steps to stem its advance.
 YEN-WARY
 An earlier media report that Prime Minister Naoto Kan was
to hold a news conference sparked profit-taking in dollar/yen
short positions, traders said.
 Kan said he would take firm action on currencies when
needed and that he would meet Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa when the central bank chief returns from an overseas
trip.
 Analysts and traders said Kan seemed to play down the
prospect of imminent action but they remained wary with the
currency so close to 15-year highs versus the dollar, with the
rapidity of any move in the yen seen as key.
 ""I don't think we'll see intervention around current levels
unless we get a disorderly move where dollar/yen falls sharply,
say by three yen, during one day,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at nabCapital.
 Despite the risk of possible action by Japanese authorities
to curb yen strength such as yen-selling intervention or
monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, some traders and
investors say the yen could still test a record high of 79.75
yen to the dollar, hit in April 1995.

 LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Investors returning to the
markets as the northern hemisphere's summer comes to a close in
the coming week face an unusual, but not unique, situation.
 Stocks have remained relatively buoyant over the summer.
Despite the odd sell-off, MSCI's all-country world index is up
around 5 percent since hitting a 2010 low at the end of May.
 At the same time, however, bond yields have all but
collapsed. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have fallen around 150
basis points since April and two-year yields are below 0.5
percent.
 In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield has lost 65 basis points
in the last month alone.
 The fall in yields is generally put down to investors
looking for safety as growth in the world-leading U.S. economy
stumbles. What is happening on stock markets indicates a
confidence in corporate earnings that could not be borne out by
such a view of the longer term.
 ""What we have seen is yields coming down on bonds and at the
same time the acyclical phenomenon of an equity rally. The
question is -- are the equity markets right or the bonds?"" said
Robert Ruttman, emerging mkts strategist at Credit Suisse in
Zurich.
 Noting that the situation has occurred before -- he
estimates perhaps 10 times in the past two or three decades --
Ruttman added: ""Usually equities have been right in terms of the
global economy recovering sustainably.""
 Many do not agree, at least in the near term. Most expect
the euro zone to slow in the second half of the year and the
data on the U.S. economy has been dire.
 Albert Edwards, the long-time bearish strategist at Societe
Generale, reckons equity investors are in for a rude shock.
 ""The global economy is sliding back into recession and they
are still not even aware that these events will trigger another
leg down in valuations,"" he said in a note.
 
 BUYING SPREE
 Heading into the week, caution is clearly the watchword.
 EPFR Global fund flow data showed U.S. equity funds
surrendering a net $5.4 billion in the latest weekly reporting
period and emerging market equity fund flows hitting a 13-week
low, although it was still a net inflow.
 Money generally went into fixed income assets, including
cash money markets.
 Reuters asset allocation polls to be released on Tuesday
should give some indication of whether this is reflected
globally among large investment houses or whether it is simply
an end of summer adjustment.
 Two major factors, however, are strongly supporting equities
-- corporate earnings and corporate buying activity.
 The U.S. earnings season has been robust to say the least:
Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research calculates that S&P 500
companies overall had second-quarter earnings growth of 38.4
percent, 11 percentage points higher than expectations.
 But perhaps more significantly, the research suggests
analysts still expect solid growth in the coming quarters and
that the decline in U.S. economic strength over the summer has
not changed their minds much.
 Third-quarter earnings growth is estimated at 24.9 percent,
down slightly from July estimates but higher than earlier in the
year. Fourth-quarter estimates are at 31.8 percent.
 At the same time, the past month has seen an explosion of
mergers and acquisitions with corporate investors seeming to
find value across the globe.
 M&A activity in August had reached $228 billion by Friday,
not far from the $260 billion record for the month hit in 2006,
before the crisis.

 LITTLE AND LARGE
 In the meantime, two events -- one big and one small --
should focus the attention of investors in the coming week as
they head in to September, a month when risk asset losses can be
large.
 The small is on Wednesday when a short-selling ban on the
Athens bourse is lifted. It was imposed in April, when the
country's debt troubles were escalating.
 Europe's sovereign debt crisis has calmed, thanks to a
number of policy moves. But things are still considered
vulnerable.
 The large is the U.S. jobs report for August, to be released
on Friday.
 It is always a key report for markets and investors because
of what it says about the environment for consumer confidence
and spending. Jobs are expected to have been cut again following
on from a loss of 131,000 last month.
 The report also comes on the back of Friday's downgrade in
Q2 GDP growth to 1.6 percent annualised from 2.4 percent by the
Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
 One bright spot might be that the latest new U.S. jobless
claims fell more than expected, although it remains to be seen
whether it was enough to signal serious improvement in the
labour market.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2010 09:44AM ET</span>",China fibreglass to face higher EU tariffs," * EU to levy extra 43.6 percent import duty from September
 * Possibility of longer-term measures being studied
 
 BRUSSELS, Aug 27 (Reuters) - EU plans for a higher tax on
fibreglass imports from China look set to pass into law next
month despite concerns the tariffs will limit supply of the
lightweight material, used in wind turbines, cars and ships.
 A proposal by the European Commission, the European Union's
executive, to impose an extra 43.6 percent tariff from Sept. 16
won support from seven of the EU's 27 states in a vote on
Thursday, with 12 opposed and 8 abstaining, EU diplomats told
Reuters.
 Under EU law, an abstention counts as a vote in favour of a
proposal, resulting in a final tally of 15 for and 12 against.
 The decision means import tarrifs on Chinese fibreglass are
now likely to rise from 7 percent to 50.6 percent.
 The move follows complaints by European producers that
Chinese exporters were dumping fibreglass on the market at
illegally low prices, threatening jobs at producers such as PPG
Industries and Saint-Gobain Vetrotex.
 European fibreglass users are opposed to the higher tariffs,
arguing that the duties will create supply shortages and raise
production costs for thousands of companies involved in turning
fibreglass into composites used in wind turbines, lightweight

 EU diplomats opposing the measures said earlier this week
they expected Thursday's vote to block the tax.
 Abstentions by the Czech Republic and Belgium -- tipping the
vote in favour of duties -- were not expected and could now pave
the way for duties to stay in place for up to five years, one
diplomat said on Friday.
 ""It's harder to get rid of an EU measure once it's on the
statute books,"" the diplomat told Reuters.
 The Commission's plans are for temporary measures. These
would take effect while an investigation into Chinese fibreglass
exports continues. Definitive five-year duties must be approved
by the 27-nation bloc and launched by March 2011.

 * Yen dips on wariness about whether Japan will take action

 (Adds comments, details)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose versus the yen
on Friday after a slightly better-than-expected reading on the
U.S. economy in the second quarter pushed Treasury yields
higher, boosting the appeal of the greenback.
 At the same time, traders trimmed long positions on the
Japanese currency after a rally earlier this week as Japan's
prime minister reiterated a threat to take steps to stem the
yen's climb.
 Analysts said the GDP data would provide an opportunity for
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to strike a slightly more
optimistic tone at a highly awaited speech at 10 a.m. (1400
GMT) but any gains in the dollar be limited until then.
 U.S. economic growth slowed to 1.6 percent in the second
quarter, more sharply than the government's initial estimate
but a touch better than market expectations. For details, see
[ID:nN26193565]
 ""It is reasonable to view the data breakdown as mildly
constructive,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head for G10 FX at
Deutsche Bank in New York. But ""I would expect that caution
before the Bernanke speech will severely curtail any positive
risk follow-through.""
 In morning trading in New York, the dollar was up 0.6
percent against the yen  at 84.92, pulling off an
intraday low of 84.28 yen as an earlier media report that Prime
Minister Naoto Kan was to hold a news conference sparked
profit-taking in dollar/yen short positions, traders said.
 Kan said he would take firm action on currencies when
needed and that he would meet Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa when the central bank chief returns from an overseas
trip. [ID:nTKZ006504]
 The yen stayed in negative territory but did not extend
losses after the comments. Analysts and traders said Kan seemed
to play down the prospect of imminent action but they remained
wary with the currency so close to 15-year highs versus the
dollar, with the speed of any move in the yen seen as key.
 ""I don't think we'll see intervention around current levels
unless we get a disorderly move where dollar/yen falls sharply,
say by 3 yen, during one day,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at nabCapital.
 But the pair stayed close to a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit
on trading platform EBS earlier this week. The euro 
rose 0.5 percent to 107.98 yen.
 The euro was steady against the dollar at $1.2717 ,
off a six-week low of $1.2587 hit earlier this week when it was
hit by concerns about the health of some euro zone countries.
 The Fed announced plans earlier this month to boost a
flagging economy by reinvesting money from maturing mortgage
bonds in government debt and investors will look for clues on
possible further moves.
 Friend at nabCapital felt the market was hoping Bernanke
hints towards further easing measures, which he said would
support stock markets as well as causing the dollar to weaken.
 RECORD PEAK
 Despite the risk of possible action by Japanese authorities
to curb yen strength such as yen-selling intervention or
monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, some traders and
investors say the yen could test a record high of 79.75 yen to
the dollar, hit in April 1995, later this year.
 The fate of the yen will depend on the overall trend of the
U.S. economy rather than the possibility of Bank of Japan
intervention, Michiharu Maeda, general manager of Dai-ichi's
separate account management division told Reuters in an
interview on Thursday.
 ""We believe that there is a big chance of the BOJ
intervening by itself ... but the impact could be limited as
the central bank's efforts could result in creating more
chances for the market to sell (the dollar against the yen),""
Maeda said.

 By Mark Felsenthal
 JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug 27 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke will have to address a number of pressing
issues in a speech on Friday as investors search for more
clarity on how close the U.S. central bank might be to another
asset-buying spree to support the flagging recovery.
 Bernanke will also likely touch on fears of waning economic
momentum as evidenced by a parade of gloomy indicators,
suggesting the U.S. economy has slowed to a crawl when he
speaks at the Fed's annual retreat in the Teton mountains.
 He may also note the Fed's decision earlier this month to
renew purchases of assets to replace ones that have rolled off
the Fed's balance sheet.
 But he seems unlikely to offer any detailed plan of what
the U.S. central bank will do going forward or to define what
would trigger more aggressive steps by the Fed.
 ""I expect Bernanke to frame the current environment and
frame the foundations for where the Fed sees things ... without
announcing any new policy,"" said Mickey Levy, chief economist
for the Bank of America.
 ""This is not the type of forum to announce a new policy,""
Levy said in an interview with Reuters Insider television.
 Others, though, warned the economy is stagnating and that
waiting too long to boost growth is risky.
 ""It's time to admit that what we have now isn't a recovery,
and do whatever we can to change that situation,"" Nobel
Laureate Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times on Friday.
 The conference, organized by the Kansas City Federal
Reserve Bank, draws prominent economists and central bank
officials from around the world to socialize and discuss
academic papers for three days in a secluded national park that
affords few distractions other than outdoor activities such as
hiking or horseback riding.
 The theme this year is macroeconomic challenges in the
decade ahead, and while Bernanke may take the long view, most
of his listeners will hang on his every word for clues about
how he plans to deal with challenges in the next ten weeks.
 Focus on the Fed chairman's speech will be particularly
keen because he will speak shortly after the release of second
quarter GDP data, which many think will be revised down
drastically from 2.4 percent, and with some forecasting it will
be below 1 percent.
 Also likely to feature in conversation will be the yen's
rise to a 15-year peak against the dollar. Worries about U.S.
growth and its impact on the world economy have led investors
to buy the yen as a safe haven, putting pressure on Japanese
exports and prompting concern from Japanese officials.
[ID:nTKZ006504]
 As for Bernanke, observers will parse his words for details
that might hint at how close he is to another push to buy
assets to lower longer term interest rates further. One telling
item could be any reference to difficulties that slow or below
trend growth pose to fulfilling the full employment side of the
Fed's dual mandate.
 ""Should Bernanke make a nod toward this sentiment that high
levels of unemployment are incompatible with the dual mandate,
we would take that as a strong signal of further balance sheet
expansion,"" Michael Feroli, an economist for JPMorgan in New
York wrote in a note to clients.
 Were Bernanke merely to repeat the Fed's oft-stated vow to
use any such policy tools as necessary to meet its objectives
would instead be seen as a more neutral stance, Feroli said.

 By Samuel Shen and Jason Subler
 SHANGHAI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Citic Securities Co, China's
biggest listed brokerage, posted a worse-than-expected 51
percent slump in second-quarter profit as a stock market tumble
hurt income from commissions and propriety trading.
 Prospects for China's brokerage industry appear dim as
China's stock market has shown signs of weakness after a July
rebound, reflecting investor concern over a slowing economy.
 Citic Securities' growth will also be hurt by a planned
restructuring that will see the company sell control of a
brokerage subsidiary and a fund management unit.
 ""Competition is intensifying in the traditional brokerage
business,"" Citic Securities said in a statement to the Shanghai
Stock Exchange.
 ""The profitability of our company is incompatible with our
scale, and our international business has just taken root.""
 The unit of China's biggest financial conglomerate, Citic
Group, made a profit of 1.13 billion yuan ($167 million) as the
stock market fell 23 percent in the quarter.
 The results lagged expectations of three analysts polled by
Reuters, who had expected profit of 1.19 billion yuan.
 The figures, calculated based on its first-half profit of
2.63 billion yuan, matched what a source with direct knowledge
of the figures told Reuters earlier on Friday.
 
 EYES OVERSEAS EXPANSION
 Citic Securities and smaller rivals Guoyuan Securities and
Changjiang Securities suffered from a stock market that slumped
27 percent in the first half. Brokerages cut commission rates to
woo customers amid cut-throat competition.
 Haitong Securities, China's second-biggest listed brokerage,
posted a 25 percent drop in first-half profit, while Changjiang
Securities saw earnings decrease 23 percent.
 New products including margin trading and short selling,
launched in earnest in the second quarter, did little to stem
the decline in earnings.
 Citic Securities' income from trading commissions fell 20
percent while investment returns tumbled 73 percent, offsetting
an increase in underwriting revenue from a steady flow of
initial public offerings.
 Its business may suffer further as the company is in the
process of selling its controlling stakes in China Securities Co
and China Asset Management Co, the country's biggest mutual fund
house, in order to comply with regulatory requirements.
 As part of its efforts to expand its business overseas and
broaden its revenue streams, Citic Securities has formed a
partnership with Credit Agricole SA, aiming to build a global
brokerage and derivatives business.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The yen dipped against the dollar
and the euro on Friday as wary nervous speculators trimmed long
positions and Japan's prime minister reiterated a threat to take
steps to stem the currency's steady rise.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he would take firm action on
currencies when needed and that he would meet Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa when the central bank chief returns
from an overseas trip.
 The yen stayed in negative territory but did not extend
losses after the comments. Analysts and traders said Kan seemed
to play down the prospect of imminent action but they remained
wary with the currency so close to 15-year highs versus the
dollar.
 Caution ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Ben
Bernanke at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole at 1400 GMT
and U.S. gross domestic product data at 1230 GMT also kept major
currency pairs within tight ranges.
 ""There doesn't seem to be any urgency to take action and
Kan's comments will do little to stop dollar/yen moving lower,""
said BNP Paribas currency strategist Ian Stannard.
 At 0916 GMT, the dollar was up 0.3 percent against the yen
at 84.72, pulling off an intraday low of 84.27 yen as traders
said an earlier media report that Kan was to hold a news
conference sparked profit-taking in dollar/yen short positions.
 But the pair stayed close to a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit
on trading platform EBS earlier this week and still below 85.00
yen, which had been seen as a level of concern for Japanese
authorities. The euro rose 0.3 percent to 107.72 yen.
 ""We have had such a strong move followed by more and more
talk about possible intervention risk that it is natural people
would want to trim long positions,"" said Anders Soderberg,
currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 The euro was steady against the dollar at $1.2716, off a
six-week low of $1.2588 hit earlier this week when it was hit by
concerns about the health of some euro zone countries.
 Traders said the euro held within a tight range ahead of
U.S. GDP data and Bernanke's speech. They cited bids around
$1.2690, capped by offers around $1.2750.
 The Fed announced plans earlier this month to boost a
flagging economy by reinvesting money from maturing mortgage
bonds in government debt and investors will look for clues on
possible further moves.
 SEB's Soderberg said the market was priced for a downward
revision to U.S. GDP after recent weak data. A particularly weak
number may cause knee-jerk dollar falls but this would probably
be short-lived if global equities fell in response, prompting
investors to seek the safety of the greenback, he said.

 * Recovery expected to tail off in second half of 2010
 
(Adds details)
 By David Milliken and Matt Falloon
 LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew at its
fastest pace for nine years in the second quarter, an unexpected
revision to official data showed on Friday, but economists said
a sharp slowdown was still on the cards.
 Strong construction activity caused the Office for National
Statistics to boost its initial estimate of 1.1 percent GDP
growth for the three months to June to 1.2 percent, against
expectations for an unchanged reading.
 The upbeat data follows strong August retail and industrial
orders surveys, suggesting that Britain's recovery from its
deepest recession since World War Two had not wholly run out of
steam. Growth was 0.3 percent in the first quarter.
 No economists expect a repeat of what was the strongest
expansion since the first quarter of 2001, with the debate now
focused on whether UK growth will just slow towards its trend of
about 0.6 percent or slump in the face of a global downturn.
 ""The expenditure breakdown of GDP shows that the recovery is
built on very fragile foundations,"" said Samuel Tombs of Capital
Economics. ""Total investment posted a larger than expected fall,
while net trade made no contribution to GDP growth.""
 Financial markets have increasingly been pricing in a weak
growth outturn for 2011 due to a lacklustre U.S. economy and
looming public spending cuts across Europe, not least in Britain
where most government departments' budgets are set to fall by a
quarter over four years.
 Ed Balls -- a confidante of former prime minister Gordon
Brown and a contender for the leadership of the opposition
Labour Party -- warned in a speech on Friday that Britain faced
an economic ""hurricane"".

 GROWTH SUSTAINABLE?
 Economists also saw risks to Britain's growth prospects in
the latest data.
 Industrial production grew 1.0 percent in the second
quarter, matching the four-year record achieved in the first.
Services growth rose to 0.7 percent from 0.3 percent while
construction output surged by 8.5 percent after a 1.6 percent
fall.
 However, a breakdown of how this growth was achieved showed
it relied heavily on higher consumer and government spending as
well as businesses rebuilding stock levels after the recession
-- all factors that are likely to prove unsustainable.
 Household consumption rose by 1.1 percent, its fastest since
just before the start of the recession, and government spending
was up by 0.3 percent, though the gain was less than the 1.5
percent rise seen in the first quarter.
 ""Both sectors are very unlikely to maintain such growth
rates as the fiscal squeeze kicks in over the coming quarters,""
said Capital Economics' Tombs.
 Firms also increased inventory levels for the first time
since Q3 2008, but longer-term investment to boost productivity
fell by a sharp 2.4 percent and the excess of imports over
exports barely narrowed.
 The gain in construction was the biggest since 1982, but is
viewed as a one-off after work scheduled for the first quarter
was postponed to the second due to Britain's harshest winter in
around 40 years.
 The services data was downwardly revised from an initial
estimate of 0.9 percent -- largely as a result of more detailed
data showing the effect of April and May's ash cloud 
 ""The second quarter is still likely to represent the high
point of quarterly growth as fiscal tightening and a renewed
slowdown in global activity constrains a more robust recovery,""
said Hetal Mehta, an economist for Daiwa Capital Markets.
 ""The zero contribution from net trade is disappointing and
questions how much the UK can rely on an export-led recovery.""
 Sterling was half a cent lower against the dollar after the
figures because some traders had bet on an even bigger upward
revision, but gilt futures were little moved as the data showed
little to alter the outlook for monetary policy.

 * Business leaders could ratchet up pressure on govt
 * 40 percent of companies mulling factory shift overseas
(Adds background, details)
 By Isabel Reynolds
 TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Two-thirds of Japanese companies
expect the yen's strength to squeeze profits and 40 percent will
shift production overseas if the currency remains near a 15-year
high on the dollar, a government survey showed on Friday.
 The survey by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
asked 102 companies, mainly exporters, how the yen was impacting
their business following the currency's climb to around 85 yen
against the dollar, up 7 percent in the past three months.
 Some 51 percent said the stronger currency was having some
effect on profits, while 14 percent said the impact was severe.
That is four times more than in May when the yen was above 90
per dollar and only 14 percent noted any knock on earnings.
 Should the current 85 yen per dollar rate continue for six
months, the proportion of companies with worsening profitability
will increase to 72 percent, the survey showed.
 As the strain on profits increases, business leaders may
ratchet up the pressure on the government for steps to stem the
yen's rise. Failing that, corporations may move more production
outside Japan to protect against currency swings.
 Suzuki Motor Corp Chief Executive Osamu Suzuki on Thursday
urged Japan's government to safeguard the nation's economy and
said the automaker was near the limit of what it could do to
counter the yen's climb.
 Many corporate managers are considering moves overseas,
according to the survey. Forty percent of the corporations said
they would shift factories and development facilities outside
Japan, while 60 percent said they would increase the proportion
of their manufacturing carried out abroad.
 For some, the escape from Japan is well underway. By 2008,
before the current yen strength, the average ratio of overseas
production was 17 percent compared with 6 percent in 1990,
according to separate data from METI.
 Nissan Motor Co said Friday that output outside Japan rose
by a fifth in July compared with a year ago and only a 4.7
percent gain at its domestic factories.
 The Japanese carmaker in March shifted production of its
popular March model to Thailand, a portion of which it is
shipping back to sell in its home market.
 Most Japanese manufacturing firms see the yen averaging
about 90 yen to the dollar for the financial year ending March
31, the survey said.

290,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2010 04:56AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Russian drought to put a brake on rouble's rise," * Drought may hurt current account surplus
 * Deterioration in fundamentals may deter foreign investors
 * Analysts see little scope for rouble gains by year-end
 
 By Andrey Ostroukh
 MOSCOW, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Russia's severe drought and
stumbling oil prices look set to cap the rouble's appreciation
this year as they put pressure on the country's revenues and
current account surplus.
 When the drought began in late June, banks including Goldman
Sachs, Raiffeisen and BNP Paribas saw it as positive for the
rouble, expecting the central bank would battle an expected rise
in food inflation by allowing greater currency appreciation.
 But as a prolonged drought has devastated many Russian
grain-growing regions, slashing its grain crop by nearly a
third, Russia is having to import more than previously thought,
putting pressure on the country's current account surplus.
 Along with a faltering global economic recovery, which is
depressing oil prices and risk appetite, that is prompting
analysts to trim their rouble forecasts, arguing that supporting
the economy will take precedence over combatting inflation risk.
 Russia's economy grew 2.5 percent year-on-year in July --
half as fast as in June -- and concern about the outlook and
reduced demand for riskier, emerging market assets have pushed
the rouble to a seven-week low this week at 30.95 to the dollar.
 Russia's Economy Ministry, in economic forecasts for
2011-2013 released on Thurdsay, has downgraded its exchange rate
forecasts for the next three years.
 It no longer expects the currency -- which has rallied 20
percent against its basket since the start of 2009 -- to
gradually appreciate, forecasting the currency will average 30.5
to the dollar next year and close to that in 2012 and 31.0 to
the dollar in 2013.
 Gazprombank has revised its forecast for the rouble for the
end of this year to 34.27 against the basket, from a forecast in
July of 33.57, and only 0.5 percent higher than current levels.
 ""The downside pressure on the rouble will likely have two
sources. The first is a presumed weakness of oil prices, the
other is a reduction of the current account surplus from rising
imports,"" said Anna Bogdyukevich, analyst at Gazpromban.
 ING has cut its year-end forecast to 33.05 roubles per
basket from 31.93 a month ago.
 Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach said this week that
the drought would cut economic growth this year by up to 0.8
percentage points and push inflation up above the 6-7 percent
target.
 The rouble, he said, should be largely unaffected as Russia
will retain its trade surplus and reserves. Financial markets,
however, are not convinced.
 ""If inflation accelerates it points at pressure on the
rouble through higher imports and pressure on the trade
balance,"" said Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank.
 Rising imports, she says, could slash the fourth-quarter
current account surplus to below $10 billion from $33.3 billion
in the first quarter of 2010.
 ""Only a few are betting on a stronger rouble now as there is
no confidence in fundamental reasons,"" Orlova said, forecasting
the rouble will end 2010 at 34.20 versus its basket.
 Signs that global economic recovery is slowing have sent oil
prices down $10 from a peak of nearly $83 on Aug. 4, threatening
to hurt revenues in Russia, the world's biggest oil producer
which relies on the oil and gas industry for more than half of
its budget income.
 Russia's imports from countries outside the former Soviet
Union surged 35.6 percent in July from a year earlier and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Andrei Sizov Sr., CEO of
SovEcon agricultural analysts, said on Thursday that Russia,
usually the world's No. 3 wheat exporter, may need to import up
to 6 million tonnes of grain in 2010/11 because of the drought.
 
 FUND OUTFLOWS
 Investor sentiment already seems to be cooling on Russia,
which had been favoured as it offers yields above 6 percent on
some assets. Data from Emerging Portfolio Fund Research shows
Russia saw its biggest weekly fund outflow since May in the week
to Aug. 20, extending outflows in previous weeks.
 ""Foreign investors' attitude towards Russia is becoming
worse given a deterioration in the economic outlook.
Undoubtedly, the drought factor took its toll,"" said a dealer at
a major Russian bank in Moscow.
 The government forecasts 4 percent economic growth this
year, reversing a 7.9 percent slump last year, but Klepach
warned growth could be only 3.6-3.8 percent due to the drought.
 The rouble has weakened to seven-week lows of 34.65 against
its basket -- moving out of the central bank's intervention
range of 34.40-33.40 per basket.
 That means the central bank is not standing in the way of
the rouble. So if it wanted to battle inflation with a stronger
currency it would have to stage artificial appreciation by
actually buying roubles -- something it is unlikely to do at a
time when economic growth is slowing.
 Any such steps would also contradict its intervention policy
and its aim of gradually moving towards a free-float regime.
 Raising interest rates from current record lows is also seen
as unlikely.
 ""The rouble doesn't appreciate by itself, and to make it
stronger the central bank would have to sell its reserves or
hike interest rates, which is absolutely inappropriate for the
post-crisis economy,"" said Vladimir Osakovsky, economist at
Unicredit bank in Moscow.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2010 04:36AM ET</span>",UK Q2 GDP growth unexpectedly revised up to nine-year high," LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew faster
than originally estimated in the second quarter of this year,
hitting its fastest rate of growth in more than nine years,
official data showed on Friday.
 The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew by
1.2 percent in the three months to June, up from its preliminary
estimate of 1.1 percent, after construction output proved
stronger than first thought. Analysts had expected no revision.
 On the year, the economy grew 1.7 percent in the second
quarter -- 0.1 percentage points higher than the ONS's first
estimate and economists' forecasts. 
 The economy grew 0.3 percent in the first three months of
the year. 
 The figures provide further evidence that Britain's economic
recovery accelerated sharply during the first half of the year
but economists are concerned that a weakening global economy and
looming UK government spending cuts will sap growth in 2011.

 * Yen dips on wariness about whether Japan will take action
 * Traders await Bernanke's speech, U.S. GDP data

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The yen dipped against the dollar
and the euro on Friday on jitters over whether Japanese
authorities could be preparing to take action to stem the yen's
rise.
 The dollar held within tight ranges against major currencies
on caution before a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Ben
Bernanke at the annual Federal Reserve conference in Jackson
Hole and U.S. gross domestic product data.
 Kyodo news agency reported Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan
would speak on Friday on steps to cope with a recent surge in
the yen, while Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reiterated the
government would take appropriate action when needed.
 This put a lid on yen gains as investors paused before the
weekend, traders and analysts said.
 ""We have had such a strong move followed by more and more
talk about possible intervention risk that it is natural people
would want to trim long positions,"" said Anders Soderberg,
currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 At 0802 GMT, the dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen
at 84.67, pulling off an intraday low of 84.27 yen as traders
said the media report of Kan's news conference sparked
short-squeezing in dollar/yen.
 But the pair stayed close to a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit
on trading platform EBS earlier this week. The euro rose 0.3
percent to 107.76 yen.
 The euro inched up 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.2729
, off a six-week low of $1.2588 hit earlier this week, on
renewed concerns about the fiscal health of some peripheral euro
zone countries.
 Traders said the euro held within a tight range ahead of
U.S. GDP data at 1230 GMT and Bernanke's speech at 1400 GMT.
They cited bids around $1.2690, capped by offers around $1.2750.
 The Fed announced plans earlier this month to boost a
flagging economy by reinvesting money from maturing mortgage
bonds in government debt and investors will look for clues on
possible further moves.
 ""Jackson Hole has not traditionally been a venue for major
policy statements, but we do not exclude this possibility,""
analysts at JPMorgan said in a research note.
 SEB's Soderberg said the market was priced for a downward
revision to U.S. GDP after recent weak data. A particularly weak
number may cause knee-jerk dollar falls but this would probably
be short-lived if global equities fell in response, prompting
investors to seek the safety of the greenback, he said.
 RECORD PEAK
 Despite the risk of possible action by Japanese authorities
to curb yen strength such as yen-selling intervention or
monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, some traders and investors
say the yen could test a record high of 79.75 yen to the dollar,
hit in April 1995, later this year.
 The fate of the yen will depend on the overall trend of the
U.S. economy rather than the possibility of Bank of Japan
intervention, Michiharu Maeda, general manager of Dai-ichi's
separate account management division told Reuters in an
interview on Thursday.
 ""We believe that there is a big chance of the BOJ
intervening by itself ... but the impact could be limited as the
central bank's efforts could result in creating more chances for
the market to sell (the dollar against the yen),"" Maeda said.
 A euro zone source familiar with the situation said on
Thursday that joint central bank intervention to stem the rise
of the yen was not likely.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - World stocks held near a recent
seven-week low on Friday while government bonds rose as
investors braced for an update on the U.S. economic outlook from
the country's top central banker following a run of weak data.
 The yen slipped against the dollar as speculation persisted
that Tokyo might take steps to stem export-damaging strength in
the Japanese currency.
 Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is expected to signal
in a speech at 1400 GMT that the U.S. economy is facing
uncertain prospects. The second estimate for second-quarter U.S.
growth, due out before he speaks, is expected to show a slower
rate of expansion than initially reported.
 ""We are going to have a bumpy couple of weeks, maybe even
months, ahead. We need to have some clear evidence for the U.S.
economy to turn the corner to get people to look at the equity
market again,"" said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment
Managers in Paris.
The MSCI world equity index was unchanged on the day at
278.18, off a seven-week low hit earlier this week. The index
has lost four percent in August. The Thomson Reuters global
stock index was also steady.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.1 percent while
emerging stocks dropped 0.4 percent.
 U.S. stock futures rose around 0.4 percent, pointing to a
slightly firmer open on Wall Street later.
 U.S. crude oil gained 0.4 percent to $73.66.
 German Bund futures rose 44 ticks. The 10-year benchmark
Bund yield lost almost one basis point to 2.141 percent, just
above record lows of 2.092 percent set on Wednesday. The yield
has fallen more than 50 basis points in August, the biggest
monthly fall since November 2008.
 The yen fell a quarter of a percent to 84.68 per dollar, off
its 15-year high near 83.60 hit earlier this week.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he will take firm
measures on currencies when needed and will meet the Bank of
Japan governor, increasing the possibility the central bank will
ease policy soon as it confronts a surging yen.
 The dollar was almost unchanged on the day against a basket
of major currencies.
 Friday's second estimate for U.S. second-quarter growth is
expected show the economy grew 1.4 percent last quarter, down
from an initial reading of 2.4 percent.
 ""In light of weak data releases seen over the past three
months, it seems no longer a question of if the Fed heads
towards additional easing, but when,"" BNP Paribas said in a note
to clients.
 ""Hence, the market reaction will be seen in the context of
the Fed's willingness to operate ahead or behind the curve.""

 * Economist says state worker strike costing $150 mln a day
 * Government calls for essential workers to return

(Adds public services minister's appeal, link to graphic)
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 27 (Reuters) - South Africa's largest
union threatened on Friday to bring gold and platinum mining and
other industries to a halt next week in a strike to support a
labour stoppage by 1.3 million state workers.
 The strike by state workers seeking pay raises more than
double the inflation rate started last week and has led to
school closures, prevented medical treatment and caused bodies
to pile up at state-run morgues.
 The National Union of Mineworkers said its members would
launch the solidarity strike next Thursday, limited to one day
for now but it could be prolonged, which would deal a blow to
the mining sector in Africa's largest economy -- responsible for
5 to 6 percent of South Africa's gross domestic product.
 NUM is the biggest union in the country's largest labour
federation COSATU, which says it has 2 million members and on
Thursday filed seven-day strike notices that would allow members
in affiliated unions to strike..
 ""The NUM fully supports the public sector strike and would
next week Thursday ensure that every mining operation, every
construction site and every energy worker joins the public
sector strike in different forms,"" it said in a statement.
 South Africa is the world's fourth largest gold producer
and largest platinum producer, with mines turning out about 488
kg (1,076 lb) of gold and 385 kg of platinum a day.
 The country's biggest firms, such as Anglo Platinum, Impala
Platinum and Harmony Gold Mining, have stockpiles of the
precious metal and would not be hard-hit if it was a one-day
work stoppage.
 The NUM said on Friday some workers at a Rio Tinto-BHP
Billiton titanium joint venture had also downed tools in a
dispute over wages.
 Thousands of municipal workers defied a court order and
staged a one-day sympathy strike on Friday that slowed garbage
collection in major cities.
 Public Service and Administration Minister Richard Baloyi
repeated a call for essential workers including security guards,
nurses, daycare providers and sewerage maintenance workers, to
obey a court order compelling them to go back to work. 
 Thousands have defied the order and risk losing their jobs
if the government decides to seek punishment.
 A spokesman for the minister said there were no formal plans
for negotiations but the lines of communication had been open.
 ""There are concerned engagements as part of the effort to
end this strike,"" Dumisani Nkwamba told Reuters.
 
 BUDGET STRAIN
 The government has said it cannot afford the state workers'
demand of an 8.6 percent wage rise, more than double the
inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($137) a month as a housing
allowance. It has offered 7 percent and 700 rand.
 Any agreement to end the dispute is likely to swell state
spending by about 1 to 2 percent, forcing the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 Spending on personnel is the biggest category of state
expenditure, taking up about a third of the budget. In 2006/07,
about 35 percent of tax revenue went to paying state employees
and that rose to about 46 percent in 2009/10, which means any
wage deal could lead to increased taxes.
 Jasson Urbach, an economist with the Free Market Foundation,
estimated the work stoppage was costing the economy about $150
million a day.
 An expanded strike would add to worries about prospects for
growth after the economy slowed more than expected in the second
quarter of 2010 as mining contracted and manufacturing expanded
at a slower pace.
 Pressure is mounting on the government to reach a deal
before it deals a significant blow to Africa's largest economy,
which might also help it mend ties with COSATU, which has said
their decades-long alliance was in jeopardy of rupture.
 The unions are under the gun to reach a deal with public
opinion turning against them after strikers harassed students
trying to go to school and blocked the sick from seeking medical
care, which health officials said led to several deaths.

 * Bonds still popular but pace of inflows slowing
 * Emerging market bonds have 13th week of inflows
 TAIPEI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Investors moved decisively into
bond funds and slashed their equity portfolios on mounting
fears slowing U.S. economic activity will have a knock-on
effect on the rest of the world, EPFR Global data showed on
Friday.
 Equity funds tracked by the fund research firm saw an
aggregate $7.1 billion redeemed in the week to August 25, while
bond funds of all kinds absorbed a total $5.2 billion and money
market funds had inflows for the fourth week in the last five.
 U.S. economic data have been a steady flow of disappointing
pointers, with new home sales tumbling to a record low and the
labour force shrank for two straight months in July.
 Investors have been betting monetary policy will remain
loose for a very long time in many parts of the world, buying
up corporate, municipal and government bonds.
 In the latest week, they have also become more cautious
about emerging markets equities, an asset class that has been a
standout for the past year.
 EMERGING MARKET EQUITY FUNDS
 Global emerging market equity funds had net inflows of $322
million, the lowest total since a streak of inflows began 13
weeks ago.
 Asia-Pacific equity funds were relatively hard hit, posting
outflows of $289 million for the week, based on fears a U.S.
slowdown would hurt the region's exporters.
 Both Latin American and Europe, Middle East & Africa fund
groups absorbed less than $40 million each.
 In terms of frontier markets, Africa funds maintained their
sleeper hit status. They took in new money for the 50th time in
51 weeks as year-to-date inflows surpassed the $550 million
mark, three times their record full year total in 2007.
 DEVELOPED MARKET EQUITY FUNDS
 U.S. equity funds had the biggest outflows among developed
markets in dollar terms. They had net outflows of $5.4 billion
in the latest week, though that was smaller than the prior
week's redemptions and small cap U.S. equity funds had net
inflows for only the third time in the last 15 weeks.
 Europe equity funds had fresh outflows, bringing
year-to-date redemptions to $15.7 billion, and Japan equity
funds had a ninth consecutive week of outflows.
 SECTOR FUNDS
 Inflows to energy sector funds dominated the sector-focused
funds. The energy sector had $442 million in new money in the
latest week, despite fears of slowing crude demand resulting
from softer global growth prospects.
 Other sectors had varying degrees of redemptions.
 Investors pulled $435 million out of consumer goods sector
funds, ended a five-week string of inflows into real estate
sector funds and knocked technology sector funds deeper into
negative territory for the year.
 BOND FUNDS
 Emerging market bond funds are still the rising star of
this fund group. They have had inflows for 13 weeks in a row
and year-to-date inflows are now more than 300 percent of the
previous full-year record set in 2005.
 U.S. bond funds had $2.5 billion in inflows for the week,
bringing year-to-date inflows above $66 billion.
 Inflows into global bond funds have been robust this year
as well, but have lost momentum since early May as downgrades
of smaller developed European markets have taken their toll.
 During the first four months of this year weekly inflows
into the fund group averaged $1.82 billion. Since early May
that average has fallen to $826 million.

expect the yen's strength to squeeze profits and 40 percent will
shift production overseas if the currency remains at present

 The survey by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
asked 102 companies, mainly exporters, how the yen was impacting

 Some 51 percent said the stronger currency was having some

only 14 percent noted any knock to profitability.
 Should the current 85 yen per dollar rate level continue for

 TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen on
Friday, trimming earlier losses due to wariness on possible
measures from Japanese authorities to stem the yen's rise.
 Prompting these jitters was a Kyodo news agency report
saying Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan will hold a news
conference on Friday on the government's steps to cope with a
recent surge in the yen.
 Separately, Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda
reiterated that the government will take appropriate action on
currencies when necessary.
 ""The yen did dip a little bit, but I think market players
were already bracing for this type of news,"" said Yuji Matsuura,
joint general manager for Aozora Bank's forex & derivatives
trading group.
 Any gains in the greenback could turn out to be limited,
with Japanese exporters likely to be waiting to sell the dollar
on any rallies, Matsuura said.
 The yen may also get a lift if Kan does not unveil any
concrete steps to curb the yen's rise, Matsuura added.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent against the yen from late U.S.
trading on Thursday at 84.71 yen.
 The greenback pulled up from an intraday low of 84.27 yen as
the media report on Kan's news conference sparked
short-squeezing in dollar/yen, a senior trader at a big Japanese
bank said.
 But the pair was was still not that far away from a 15-year
low of 83.58 yen hit on trading platform EBS earlier this week.
 Another focus is what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
may say on the U.S. economy when he speaks later on Friday at
the annual Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
 Investors will be watching to see whether the Fed's views on
the economy have become bleaker since its policy meeting earlier
in August.
 ""In addition, the market will closely watch for hints of

 The Federal Reserve announced plans earlier this month to
boost a flagging economy by reinvesting money from maturing
mortgage bonds in government debt.
 Market players say the Fed's pledge to maintain asset
purchases and shift to Treasuries suggests it may boost the size
of its already massive $2.3 trillion balance sheet if the
economy loses momentum.
 The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.2728. It dipped to a
six-week low of $1.2588 earlier this week, partly due to a
renewed focus on fiscal woes among some peripheral euro zone
countries.
 WILL YEN HIT RECORD PEAK?

 ""We believe that there is a big chance of the BOJ

central bank's efforts could result in creating more chances for

 Many analysts think solo yen-selling intervention by
Japanese authorities would amount to little more than a drop in
the ocean, since the driving force behind the yen's rise is
mounting worry that the U.S. economy is headed for a double-dip
recession and the Federal Reserve may boost quantitative easing.
 A euro zone source familiar with the situation said on
Thursday that joint central bank intervention to stem the rise
of the yen is not likely, and that it is more realistic to
expect Japan to act alone.

 * Trade deficit slices 3.37 percentage points off GDP
 * Analysts still see modest growth, not double dip
(Updates markets to close)
 By Lucia Mutikani
 WASHINGTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. economic recovery
was weaker than originally estimated in the second quarter and
analysts have now revised forecasts for third quarter growth
down also.
 Gross domestic product growth, the measure of total goods
and services output within U.S. borders, was revised down to
only 1.6 percent, from 2.4 percent, the Commerce Department
said. The economy grew at a 3.7 percent pace in the first
quarter of 2010.
 Many economists had forecast an even bigger downward
revision to only 1.4 pct growth, but most still do not believe
the economy will slide back into recession and say the most
likely prospect is for continued slow expansion.
 ""The outlook continues to be one of modest growth rather
than double dip. The question remains whether subpar growth
that fails to bring down the unemployment rate is a high enough
bar for further Fed policy action,"" said Julia Coronado, an
economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 Second quarter growth was dampened by the largest increase
in imports in 26 years, but robust business investment and a
slight increase in consumer spending partially cushioned the
blow.

 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told central bankers
at their annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Friday
that the recovery had weakened more than expected and
reiterated the U.S. central bank was ready to take further
steps if needed to spur economic growth.
 ""The committee is prepared to provide additional monetary
accommodation through unconventional measures if it proves
necessary, especially if the outlook were to deteriorate
significantly,"" he said. For more, see: [ID:nN27258237]
 The better-than-expected second quarter growth figure and
Bernanke's commitment to aid the economy helped U.S. stocks to
post their biggest gains in nearly four weeks. But the U.S.
Treasury debt market suffered its largest sell-off in three
months after recent rally. The U.S. dollar ended slightly
weaker against most major currencies.
 U.S. economic data for July have so far been downbeat and a
Reuters survey of economists on Friday forecast third-quarter
growth at a 1.7 percent rate, down from expectations of 2.4
percent just over two weeks ago. The chances of a double-dip
recession rose to 25 percent from 15 percent. [ID:nNLLRJE6E5]
 BAD POLITICAL OMEN
 A slackening recovery poses a political challenge for the
Obama administration and the Democratic Party a little over two
months away from mid-term elections that could shift the
balance of power in Congress in favor of Republicans.
 A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week found Obama's approval
rating at 45 percent, overtaken for the first time by a 52
percent disapproval rating.
 The White House said four straight quarters of growth were
encouraging, adding the administration was focusing on a raft
of measures, including help for small businesses and promotion
of exports.
 The U.S. economy's recovery from its worst economic
downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s had been
largely fueled by an $862 billion government stimulus package
and businesses rebuilding inventories from record low levels.
 A record budget deficit makes it unlikely the government
will inject more money to shore up the economy.
 While growth in the United States is slowing, output in
other industrialized nations is holding up. Britain's economy
grew at its fastest pace in nine years in the second quarter on
strong construction activity. [ID:nLDE67Q0PR]
 BIGGER TRADE DEFICIT REDUCES GROWTH
 Growth in the last quarter was stifled by a 32.4 percent
surge in imports, the largest since the first quarter of 1984,
dwarfing a 9.1 percent rise in exports. That created a trade
deficit, which cut 3.37 percentage points from GDP, the largest
subtraction since the fourth quarter of 1947.
 ""The growth in imports is across the board. The strong
demand for imports indicates there is pent up demand out there,
but for growth it's negative because exports are not keeping
pace,"" said Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics for Moody's
Economy.com in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
 A smaller contribution than initially estimated from
business inventories, which had been a major driver of the
recovery that started in the second half of 2009, also
restrained output.
 Business inventories increased $63.2 billion, rather than
the previously estimated $75.7 billion, after increasing $44.1
billion in the first three months of the year.
 CONSUMER SPENDING UP
 There were some bright spots in the report though, with

 * Wariness about possible Japan steps may limit yen rise
 * Dollar selling interest may emerge near Y84.50 to Y85.00
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower against the
yen on Friday, inching back towards a 15-year low hit earlier
this week, as investors braced for a speech from Federal Chairman
Ben Bernanke speech later in the day.
 The annual Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, where Bernanke will give his thoughts on the U.S.
economy, has investors cautious given the uncertainty surrounding
the U.S. economic recovery.
 Investors will be watching for any hints as to whether the
Fed's views on the economy have changed since its policy meeting
earlier in August.
 ""In addition, the market will closely watch for hints of
further expansion to the balance sheet. Jackson Hole has not
traditionally been a venue for major policy statements, but we do
not exclude this possibility,"" analysts at JPMorgan said in a
research note.
 The Federal Reserve announced plans earlier this month to
boost a flagging economy by reinvesting money from maturing
mortgage bonds in government debt.
 Market players say the Fed's pledge to maintain asset
purchases and shift to Treasuries suggests it may boost the size
of its already massive $2.3 trillion balance sheet if the economy
loses momentum.
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent against the yen from late U.S.
trading on Thursday to 84.35 yen, inching back in the direction
of a 15-year low of 83.58 yen hit on trading platform EBS earlier
this week.
 Although there is some potential for month-end yen buying by
Japanese exporters, given that the dollar is trading below 85.00
yen, they may hold off from selling for now, said a trader for a
major Japanese bank, adding that exporters may choose to sell the
dollar on Aug. 31 instead, using trades for same-day settlement.
 The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.2704. The euro had dipped to
a six-week low of $1.2588 earlier this week, due partly to a
renewed focus on fiscal woes among some peripheral euro zone
countries.
 Against the yen, the euro dipped 0.2 percent to 107.13 yen.
The euro hit a nine-year low of 105.44 yen earlier this week.
 Wariness towards possible action by Japanese authorities to
curb yen strength such as yen-selling intervention or monetary
easing by the Bank of Japan may help limit any gains in the yen,
said a manager for a foreign exchange broker in Tokyo.
 At the same time, however, selling to sell the dollar on
rallies was likely to emerge at levels above 84.50 yen to around
85.00 yen, he said.
 Speculation has grown in recent weeks that Japan may
intervene to stem the yen's rise for the first time since March
2004.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2010 07:56PM ET</span>","Cuba, with eye on golf, liberalizes land law"," * Foreign investors can use state land for 99 years
 * Golf course developers have pushed for the change
 HAVANA, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The cash-strapped Cuban
government will allow foreign investors to use state-owned land
for up to 99 years in a change that is likely to bring
developments of luxury golf courses to the communist island.
 The new law, published in the Official Gazette on Thursday,
was said to be aimed at ""facilitating the process of
participation of foreign investment in international tourism""
by giving ""greater security and guarantee to the foreign
investor in the real estate business.""
 Cuban authorities have said that a dozen or so golf
developments are under consideration as they seek ways to boost
tourist revenues for the fragile economy.
 Before the legal change, which was decreed in July but not
announced until Thursday, Cuban law permitted use of state
lands for 50 years. Most land in Cuba belongs to the
government.
 Foreign investors who have proposed the golf developments
say the 99-year limit is necessary to attract buyers and make
their projects, which will feature course-side homes,
financially viable.
 Cuba, which discouraged the sport after the 1959
revolution, has only two golf courses.
 Cuba attracted about 2.4 million tourists last year, and is
hoping golf will bring wealthier visitors to the island.
 Officials are also planning for the day when the United
States, 90 miles (145 km) away, ends its longstanding ban on
travel to Cuba.
 Legislation is pending in the U.S. Congress that would lift
the ban that is part of the 48-year-old U.S. trade embargo
against Cuba.
 President Raul Castro has undertaken various reforms to
improve the Cuban economy, with the goal of ensuring the
survival of the communist system installed after the revolution
that put his older brother Fidel Castro in power.
 Earlier this month, he told the national parliament that
the government would grant more licenses for people to operate
small businesses.
 In another decree published in the Official Gazette on
Thursday, the government said it would allow small-time private
vendors to sell agricultural products from roadside stands.
 The concept has been in use in some parts of the country
since last year, but now is official national policy.

 * Dow Industrials close below 10,000 on thin volumes
 * World stocks rise off 7-wk lows after European earnings
 * Euro rises, investors await Bernanke economy speech
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. shares closed
at seven week lows on Thursday, marring an otherwise positive
day in global equity markets as sentiment turned negative in
thin seasonal trade ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 While the U.S. stock market fell, pulling the Dow Jones
Industrial average below the psychologically significant 10,000
mark, it was just the opposite in Europe and Japan where prices
rebounded.
 In Europe, strong earnings helped boost shares from five
week closing lows and in Japan, buyers stepped in after
four-days of losses to pull the Nikkei up from a 16-month
trough.
 The euro advanced against the greenback and yen, which
helped bolster crude oil prices more than 1 percent but did not
give spot gold a lift.
 Data showing new weekly U.S. jobless benefit claims fell
more than expected last week were still too high to signal a
shift in the weak labor market that is constraining economic
growth.
 ""The best the bull can say is that the recovery is evening
itself out now, it's not accelerating any more,"" said Linda
Duessel, market strategist at Federated Investors in
Pittsburgh.
 ""We think it's a soft patch and not a double dip, but the
market is pricing more and more for a double dip, so you're
vulnerable to the upside,"" she said.
 Bernanke speaks on Friday at an annual Fed meeting in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While he is likely to signal his views
about prospects for the U.S. economy he may not offer clues on
whether the Fed will try to shore up growth with another round
of cash injections.
 ""Labor market weakness remains the primary concern in the
economy,"" said Dana Saporta, economist at Credit Suisse.
""That's something that Bernanke has to address at his Jackson
Hole speech tomorrow.""
 At the close of trade, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> fell 74.25 points, or 0.74 percent, to 9,985.81, its
lowest point since early July. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> lost 8.11 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,047.22. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 22.85 points, or 1.07
percent, at 2,118.69.
 REBOUND
 Elsewhere, strong corporate earnings aided Europe's
markets. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European
shares closed 0.9 percent higher at 1,020.27 points.
 French bank Credit Agricole  rose 2.7 percent on
an 89 percent rise in second-quarter net profit, miner
Kazakhmys  gained 5.2 percent after its underlying
first-half earnings per share jumped 130 percent and French
hotel group Accor  rose 3.9 percent on doubling of
core profit.
 MSCI's main gauge of global equities <.MIWD00000PUS> was up
0.33 percent after hitting its lowest level since July 7 on
Wednesday. The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU>
was 0.13 percent higher.
 ""Companies have been reporting reasonable results,"" said
David Buik, partner at BGC Partners. ""But whether a rally can
be sustained is to be seen. There is nothing to say the bad
news is all over.""
 With only a few companies left to report for the second
quarter, Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research shows U.S. S&P
500 <.SPX> had average earnings growth of 38.4 percent in the
recent reporting season.
 Markets have been balancing good corporate profit results
with signs that growth in the U.S. economy is slowing.
 EURO RISES
 In currencies, safe-havens such as the yen and the Swiss
franc extended their rallies ahead of Bernanke's speech.
 Any statement from Bernanke on continuing or increasing
economic stimulus measures could dent the dollar given that
European authorities are perceived as more given to austerity
than the U.S.
 ""A second round of quantitative easing will likely put
sharp downward pressure on the dollar, to some degree versus
the euro and other G10 currencies, with potential for a broader
dollar sell-off,"" said Steven Englander, Citigroup's global
head of G10 currency strategy.
 The euro rose 0.47 percent to $1.2716  while the
dollar fell 0.18 percent against the yen , retesting its
the 15 year-low reached on Tuesday.
 Investors will also get a chance to hear what Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa has to say on the yen or monetary
policy in Jackson Hole.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.47 percent to
82.872 <.DXY>. It hit 83.556 on Tuesday, a six-week high.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury  rose 16/32
in price, yielding 2.48 percent after solid auction demand.
 Benchmark U.S. crude  settled at $73.36, up 84 cents
per barrel. Spot gold slipped $4.95 to $1,234.05

 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped
against both the euro and the yen on Thursday as investors
braced for a speech from Federal Chairman Ben Bernanke speech

expansion and implicit monetization of fiscal expenditures are

 Rising concerns over the deepening economic slowdown pushed
the yen and Swiss franc to multiyear highs this week due to
their perceived safe-haven status.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar fell 0.2
percent to 84.44 yen , while the euro rose 0.5 percent to
$1.2716 . The yen rose to a 15-year high against the
dollar on Tuesday.
 The euro touched an all-time low versus the Swiss franc on
Wednesday  but recovered and was off that trough
despite a 0.1 percent decline to 1.3027 francs on Thursday. The
single currency rebounded against the yen to trade 0.3 percent
higher at 107.38 yen  after hitting a nine-year low on
Tuesday.
 The euro/dollar earlier on Thursday broke above the 55-day
and 100-day simple moving averages. A close above these levels
would add to upward momentum.
 EURO CAUTION
 But analysts said apparently better sentiment on the euro
was unlikely to be sustained.
 ""While the euro may enjoy additional near-terms gains, its
upside should prove very limited, especially in an environment
where investors are growing increasingly nervous about the
global economic outlook,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. 
 And the dollar did get some support after a government
report showed new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell
more that expected last week. [ID:nN26152418]
 Still, analysts such as Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG, said early that moves would be
limited before Bernanke's speech.
 ""For the currency market, the immediate response has been
risk positive, best expressed through dollar/yen,"" Ruskin said
after the data. But ""given proximity to the Bernanke speech
tomorrow, I suspect there will be a lack of follow-through all
round to the data.""
 JURY OUT
 Analysts said the market was also still cautious about
possible Japanese intervention, with many investors on the
sidelines.
 Demand for the yen cooled amid speculation Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa might address the currency's
strength at the Wyoming retreat.
 Speculation has grown in recent weeks that Japan may

offsetting other measures to stimulate the economy.

 But analysts said better sentiment was unlikely to be
sustained.
 ""While the euro may enjoy additional near-terms gains, its
upside should prove very limited, especially in an environment
where investors are growing increasingly nervous about the
global economic outlook,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 FED GATHERING
 Analysts said the market was well contained on caution
about possible Japanese intervention, while many investors
remained on the sideline.
 News that Shirakawa would attend the Jackson Hole
conference made some players hesitant to push the yen higher.
Speculation has grown Japan may intervene to stem the yen's
rise for the first time since March 2004. It hit an all-time
high of 79.75 to the dollar in 1995.
 Japan has not been immune to the deep global recession, and
a strong yen will dampen demand for Japanese exports,
offsetting other measures to stimulate the economy.
 Suzuki Motor, for example, loses 700 million yen ($8.3
million) from its annual operating profit for every one-yen
fall in the dollar.
 Bernanke will speak in Jackson Hole on Friday about
uncertain prospects for the world's largest economy but may not
offer many clues on whether the U.S. central bank will pump
more cash to keep the recovery going.
 ""The latest data though erratic week to week, plays to the
camp that the trends in the labor market will not put as much
pressure on the Fed Chairman to display a dovish line
(tomorrow),"" said Ruskin at Deutsche Bank.

 * Euro rises with global shares
 By Dena Aubin
 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - World stocks bounced off
seven-week lows after strong European earnings on Thursday, but
U.S. shares were little changed as better-than-expected jobs
data failed to quell fears about the struggling labor market.
 The euro rose with the advance in global equities, while
crude oil prices advanced more than 1 percent after initial
claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell more than expected. The
weaker dollar also supported oil prices.
 Most financial markets remained in a holding pattern ahead
of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday.
Bernanke, who will speak at an annual Fed meeting in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, is likely to signal his views about prospects
for the U.S. economy, though he may not offer clues on whether
the Fed will try to shore up growth with another round of cash
injections.
 ""Labor market weakness remains the primary concern in the
economy,"" said Dana Saporta, economist at Credit Suisse.
""That's something that Bernanke has to address at his Jackson
Hole speech tomorrow.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 11 points, or
0.11 percent, to 10,049. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>
was nearly steady at 1055.32, down 0.01 point. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 3.31 points, or 0.15 percent, at
2,138.23.
 ""We want more people to be finding jobs, and the claims
data is a good sign for that, but this isn't something you can
stick your hat on and think everything is better,"" said Anthony
Halpin, investment adviser at Chicago Partners Investment Group
LLC in Chicago.
 Elsewhere, the global picture was helped along by strong
corporate earnings in Europe.
 MSCI's main gauge of global equities <.MIWD00000PUS> was up
0.6 percent after hitting its lowest level since July 7 on
Wednesday. The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU>
was 0.4 percent higher.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed 0.9 percent higher at 1,020.27 points after rising as
high as 1,023.23 earlier in the day and hitting a five-week
closing low in the previous session.
 French bank Credit Agricole  rose 2.7 percent on
an 89 percent rise in second-quarter net profit, miner
Kazakhmys  gained 5.2 percent after its underlying
first-half earnings per share jumped 130 percent and French
hotel group Accor  rose 3.9 percent on doubling of
core profit.
 ""Companies have been reporting reasonable results,"" said
David Buik, partner at BGC Partners. ""But whether a rally can
be sustained is to be seen. There is nothing to say the bad
news is all over.""
 With only a few companies left to report for the second
quarter, Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research shows U.S. S&P
500 <.SPX> had average earnings growth of 38.4 percent in the
recent reporting season.
 Markets have been balancing good corporate profit results
with signs that growth in the U.S. economy is slowing.
 EURO RISES
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed on Thursday after the
jobless claims data showed the labor market was not as weak as
had been feared, driving bonds to give up earlier gains.
 But the data left unresolved the debate over whether bonds
are overpriced, or if the faltering U.S. recovery will underpin
U.S. government debt until economic indicators begin to improve
consistently, particularly the hard-hit labor market.
 The 30-year long bond  was last up 10/32 in
price, yielding 3.56 percent, versus Wednesday's close of 3.57
percent.
 Analysts say resistance lies at 3.51 percent and support at
3.82 percent.
 The benchmark 10-year note  was up 3/32 in
price, yielding 2.53 percent versus Wednesday's close of 2.54
percent.
 In currency markets, a rally in safe-haven currencies such
as the yen and the Swiss franc stalled as global equities
stabilized and investors braced for Bernanke's speech on
Friday.
 ""The latest data, though erratic week-to-week, plays to the
camp that the trends in the labor market will not put as much
pressure on the Fed Chairman to display a dovish line"" in his
speech on Friday, "" said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX
strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.
 The euro rose along with global share prices, but gains
were capped after a recent string of weak U.S. economic data
suggested the pace of recovery was slowing.
 The yen was flat to weaker but away from multi-year highs
against the dollar and the euro, as investors speculated on
whether Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will comment
on the yen or monetary policy at the Federal Reserve retreat in
Jackson Hole.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.3 percent to
82.977 <.DXY>. It hit 83.556 on Tuesday, a six-week high.
 The euro  rose around 0.2 percent on the day to
$1.2690.
 Oil rose after the positive jobless claims reading improved
sentiment and helped spur bargain-hunting. Benchmark U.S.
crude futures for October  traded at $73.42, up 90 cents
per barrel.

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The United States on
Thursday announced plans to toughen rules against what it sees
as unfair foreign trade practices, proposing a number of
changes likely to irk China, its biggest import supplier.
 At least some of the proposals could lead to higher
anti-dumping or countervailing duties on goods from the Asian
manufacturing giant, the most frequent target of U.S.
complaints about unfair trade in recent years.
 But the plan seeks to strengthen the effectiveness of U.S.
trade protection measures ""across a range of areas,"" a senior
Commerce Department official told Reuters.
 With President Barack Obama's popularity falling and
Democrats in danger of losing control of Congress in November
elections, the party has been pushing a ""Make it in America""
agenda aimed at creating U.S. manufacturing jobs.
 ""Today's announcement is another demonstration of
our continuing efforts to sharpen our trade enforcement tools,""
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said in a statement.
 It outlined 14 proposals that increase penalties or toughen
requirements on foreign companies that sell goods the United
States deems unfairly priced or subsidized.
 Although less than 3 percent of imports into the United
States are hit with anti-dumping or countervailing duties, the
trade laws can be an important source of protection for sectors
such as steel, tires, paper and other industrial goods.
 INVESTIGATIONS JUMP
 The number of U.S. investigations jumped to 34 in 2009, an
increase of 79 percent from 2008. New cases have tapered off
this year, although important decisions against China are
pending in probes involving paper and aluminum products.
 The department will issue specific proposals in coming
months for public comment, but says it does not need
legislation to make any of the proposed changes.
 One trade attorney, who asked not to be identified, said at
first glance all the initiatives appeared aimed at creating
""higher, more certain and longer-lasting duties.""
 Conspicuously missing was a decision on whether to
investigate China's exchange rate practices as an unfair
foreign subsidy, a diplomatically explosive issue before the
department in the paper and aluminum cases.
 Many lawmakers, manufacturers and economists say China's
currency is undervalued, giving it an unfair price advantage in
global markets. The department has been mulling for months
whether it has a strong legal footing to investigate the
charge.
 China accounted for 19 percent of U.S. goods imports in
2009 for a total of $296.4 billion. Next on the list was Canada
with $224.9 billion, followed by Mexico, Japan, Germany,
Britain, South Korea, France, Taiwan and Venezuela.
 Department officials said tightening the anti-dumping and
countervailing duties rules would help meet Obama's goal of
doubling U.S. exports in five years by putting domestic firms
that receive protection in a stronger position to compete.
 But Lewis Leibowitz, a trade attorney with Hogan Lovells,
said that connection is unclear since higher import duties
could boost costs for many U.S. manufacturers.
 PROPOSALS TARGET CHINA
 Department officials spotlighted three proposals they
believed would have the most impact, and said many of the ideas
are intended to tighten procedures for investigations involving
""non-market economies"" like China.
 One would require importers to pay a cash deposit to cover
preliminary duties once they are announced.
 Currently, importers have the option of posting bonds at a
fraction of their liability for the five or six months until
final duties are set.
 That has led to problems collecting the full amount the
government is owed, department officials said.
 ""We think this is a way to better ensure that companies
that ... may ultimately be liable for a dumping duty actually
have the wherewithal to pay,"" a department official said.
 A second proposed change would allow the department to
subtract Chinese export taxes when calculating the size of
anti-dumping or countervailing duties.
 That is common practice now for unfairly traded goods from
""market economies"" like Japan and countries in Europe. But it
has not been the case for non-market economies like China on
the theory the taxes are too hard to measure.
 China will ""undoubtedly"" be upset by the proposal because
it could lead to higher duties on its goods, the Commerce
Department official said.
 In a similar vein, the department also wants to make it
harder for exporters in non-market economies to win more
favorable ""separate rates"" by insisting on stronger proof the
companies are independent of government control.
 A third major proposal would stop the practice of removing
individual foreign companies from anti-dumping orders if they
can show during three annual administrative reviews they
haven't dumped products in the United States.
 Such companies could still receive a zero duty rate under
the new proposal. But they would remain subject to the order,
keeping them on notice their duty could be increased if
Commerce finds new evidence of unfair trading.
 Department officials also want to reduce the potential for
fraud by toughening ""certification requirements"" and making
attorneys and other company representatives more accountable
for the accuracy of information they submit.
 China, the European Union and others are expected to
closely scrutinize the proposals, although the U.S. officials
insist they are within the bounds of World Trade Organization
rules and in some cases match what others already do.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2010 09:36AM ET</span>","DEALTALK-Vodafone seen exiting Poland, China, eventually France"," By Kate Holton and Victoria Howley
 LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Vodafone is likely to sell assets
in Poland, China and eventually France as it starts a retreat
from sprawling international expansion designed to appease
investors who believe it needs more discipline.
 Vodafone, the world's largest telecom operator by revenue,
has said it would reconsider its strategy following shareholder
concerns, and a move to sell minority assets is seen more as a
bid to improve sentiment than drive earnings. 
 Senior bankers said Vodafone was not under pressure to sell
assets to shore up its balance sheet or improve cashflow.
 ""Investors are anxious about Vodafone's deals that were done
five to seven years ago,"" a telecoms banker said. ""The company
has acquired a reputation as a poor transactor. They need to
show investors that they are acting in a disciplined manner.""
 RBS said that because many of the assets tipped for a sale
contributed to earnings per share and free cash flow, their
disposal would have little impact on those metrics on average.
 Bankers and analysts believe Vodafone is likely to sell its
near 25 percent holding in Poland's top mobile telecoms firm
Polkomtel as opposed to buying out the other owners. An initial
public offering (IPO) is another option. 
 Its 3.2 percent holding in China Mobile is seen as an easier
asset to sell, while the 44 percent holding in France's SFR is
also likely to go eventually. 
 The review of strategy follows complaints from investors who
believe Vodafone's position of owning assets it does not control
has produced a discount between the shares and sum of the parts.
 The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which holds a 0.4
percent stake, recently accused the firm of having ""significant
structural and strategic weaknesses"".
 A disposal of small minority stakes could raise well over 10
billion pounds ($15.57 billion) which could be used to pay off
debt, any tax bills, buy spectrum and increase share buybacks. 
 ""A logical approach (would) be the recycling of disposal
proceeds into share repurchases given that Vodafone will likely
find it hard to find M&A transactions that are more accretive
than buying its own stock,"" Arete analysts said.
 
 POLAND FIRST TO GO?
 Domestic shareholders in Polkomtel have hired advisers for a
possible sale of their stakes, which could begin as early as
September, investment bankers familiar with telecoms said.
 ""It would probably want to be part of a larger deal, with
other shareholders selling too,"" a second telecoms banker said.
 Apart from Vodafone, state-controlled Polish companies
together account for around 75 per cent of Polkomtel. 
 Poland's largest power group PGE hired ING to advise it on
the options, and PGE's chief executive said that Vodafone had
also expressed an interest in selling. Oil refiner PKN is
working with Nomura and copper miner KGHM is advised by KPMG.
Bankers said that private equity firms including TPG,
Blackstone, Apex, CVC and EQT would look at the business.
 When Danish telecoms group TDC sold its Polkomtel stake in
2008, the deal valued the company at 3.7 billion euros ($4.70
billion). ""I don't think the government would want to proceed
with a sale for less than that valuation,"" the second telecoms
banker said.
 However, Vodafone would need a larger divestment than
Polkomtel to address concerns, and a sale of its holding in
China Mobile would start to fall into this category.
 A lock-up period preventing Vodafone from selling its stake
recently ended and the value of the holding has more than
doubled to around $7 billion since it bought the stake.
 Market speculation in China suggests that Vodafone would
have to sell into the open market, or possibly on to one or more
institutional investors. Vodafone has technology partnerships
with the firm and it would not want to damage the relationship
by any quick sale.
 Another stake sale that would also signal Vodafone's
seriousness in its approach is its holding in French mobile
operator SFR, with partner Vivendi indicating it wants to take
full control to give it a strong source of cash.
 Deutsche Bank estimates that Vivendi has around 8.6 billion
euros available to finance the deal without impacting its credit
rating. According to a Paris-based banker who declined to be
named, it had not yet hired an investment bank for the deal.
 The major issue will be for the two sides to agree on a
valuation. According to analysts, Vodafone in road shows with
investors this spring signalled it would consider a sale at 6x
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA), whereas Vivendi is likely to push for a valuation of
between 5-6x EBITDA. 
 They expect Vivendi could end up paying 7-8 billion euros
for the stake.
 Vodafone has said its core businesses were in Europe, Africa
and India. It's U.S. unit of Verizon Wireless, which it owns
with Verizon, is often seen as a problem as Vodafone owns 45
percent and has not received a dividend for several years.
 However it is, for the moment, more likely to hold on for a
dividend than consider a sale. 
 In India, its joint venture partner Essar had put on hold
plans for an IPO, sources told Reuters.

 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A rally in safe-haven
currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc stalled on
Thursday as global share prices rebounded, although worries
about the world economy slowing down kept them supported.
 Demand for the yen, which rose to 15-year high on Tuesday,
cooled amid speculation Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa might address the currency's strength at a Federal
Reserve retreat starting on Thursday
 European shares <.FTEU3> rose, clawing back from a

 In the United States, stock futures rose and the dollar
pared losses against the yen after a government report showed
new U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell more that

 ""Claims data surprised substantially on the downside,"" said
Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at Deutsche Bank
AG. ""For the currency market, the immediate response has been
risk positive, best expressed through dollar/yen.""
 In morning trading in New York, the dollar was 0.1 percent
higher at 84.68 yen . The euro hit a session high against
the dollar  of $1.2746 before pulling back to around
$1.2680, still up 0.1 percent on the day.
 But analysts said the better sentiment was unlikely to be
sustained. 
 ""I would expect weaker economic activity to catch up with
stock markets and demand for currencies such as the Swiss franc
and the yen to continue,"" said Chris Turner, head of FX
strategy at ING.
 Increasing concerns in the past few months about a global
economic slowdown have pushed the yen and Swiss franc higher
due to their perceived safe-haven status. The euro traded near
an all-time low versus the Swiss franc hit on Wednesday
.
 The single currency traded with gains of around 0.2 percent
versus the yen  at 107.37 yen, having made a brief
show above 108 yen earlier on a bounce in European stocks. The
euro hit a nine-year low on Tuesday.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was steady at 1.3035
francs , near an all-time low hit on Wednesday under
1.3000.
 Gains in the euro helped push the dollar <.DXY> down 0.3
percent against a currency basket.
 The euro flirted with its 55-day and 100-day moving
averages at $1.2713 and $1.2737 respectively. A close above
these levels would add to upward momentum.

 By Wojciech Moskwa
 STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Denmark's Maersk Oil,
part of AP Moeller Maersk A/S, seeks to rapidly build up a
portfolio of oil and gas assets offshore Norway through
acquisitions as well as developing its licenses.
 ""It's our ambition to meet these goals rapidly,"" Morten
Jeppesen, managing director of Maersk Oil's Norwegian unit, told
Reuters in an interview at Norway's biggest oil and gas fair on
Thursday.
 Maersk, which is the operator of three production licenses
offshore Norway, is interested in buying fields already in
production as well as fields under development, Jeppesen said.
 ""We are looking to build a portfolio offshore Norway and are
looking at a range of project sizes,"" he said, adding that the
main focus was in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea.
 ""We have a place here and are a long-term player. We intend

 Asked about Maersk Oil's budget for acquisitions, Jeppesen
said the company had deep pockets and would look at
opportunities on a ""case-by-case basis"". It recently took part
in a $6 billion petroleum development in Qatar, he added.
 He said Maersk Oil would drill its first exploratory well as
an operator offshore Norway in the first half of 2011 and that
it was looking for more staff to build up its team.

 (Adds detail, background, quotes)
 By Simon Johnson and Daniel Dickson
 STOCKHOLM, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Sweden's government sees extra
spending and tax cuts worth a combined 32.7 billion crowns ($4.4
billion) over the coming four years, setting out to woo voters
ahead of what promise to be closely fought elections next month.
 ""We are ready for four more years,"" Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt told a news conference as his Moderate Party, the
Liberal Party, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats
launched their manifesto for the September 19 vote.
 The four-party, centre-right coalition also said it would
cut the state's stakes in bank Nordea, telecoms firm TeliaSonera
and mortgage lender SBAB, reiterating earlier plans.
 ""We are not making more promises than we can keep. In total,
12.8 billion (of budget measures) in 2011, of which 9 billion is
money toward the public welfare system. We are keeping our
promise -- welfare comes first,"" Reinfeldt said.
 The plans are in line with previous predictions by senior
ministers and analysts say the reforms will do little to dent
public finances, seen by the government as returning to a
surplus of 1.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012
from an estimated 1.1 percent deficit this year.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg said the plans for next year
were equal to about 0.3 percent of GDP and represented a lower
measure of fiscal stimulus than that rolled out at the height of
the global financial crisis.
 The Social Democrat-led opposition has promised to spend
more than the centre-right on welfare while raising taxes on
high-income earners, but have yet to detail their election
platform ahead of the vote.
 
 MONEY TO SPEND
 Sweden emerged from the global downturn with the European
Union's strongest public finances as exports boomed, putting the
prime minister in the unusual position of being able to offer
fiscal largesse rather than impose austerity.
 The manifesto stressed public finances would be kept well
within the fiscal framework which includes a public spending
ceiling, but also raised prospects of another income tax cut
when a budget surplus was in sight.
 ""I am not promising any income tax cuts,"" Reinfeldt said. ""I
am saying it's a goal if the surplus we see in our forecasts
becomes a reality."" However, the government has said it would
cut taxes for pensioners by an additional 2.5 billion crowns in
2011 and, if finances allow, a further 2.3 billion later.
 Recent opinion polls have put his coalition in the lead, but
also show a hung parliament -- with neither the government nor
the centre-left opposition winning a majority -- is possible due
to a rise in support for the far-right Swedish Democrats.
 All parties have ruled out co-operating with the party,
which pushes a fiercely anti-immigrant agenda, setting the stage
for possible minority governments which analysts say might
struggle to get its policies though parliament.
 The political uncertainty could also drive up borrowing
costs for the Nordic country, though most analysts see the
country returning to the surpluses in 2011 or 2012.
 Sales of equity stakes would aid that process, and the
government said it would also consider bringing in a minority
shareholder, such as the AP pension funds, into state-owned
utility Vattenfall.
 The fresh election pledges did little to disturb Swedish
markets on Thursday, which were mainly following foreign market
trends. The crown firmed slightly against the euro and the
10-year bond yield was little changed on Wednesday.

 *Customs promise to keep up checks on wheat shipments
 *Ukraine government has put off imposing grain quotas
 
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine's Customs Service said on
Thursday it would keep up quality checks on all Ukrainian wheat
export shipments, in spite of unhappiness among traders, and
might extend them to other cereals.
 Traders have criticised new customs measures on grain
shipments out of Ukrainian ports, saying they are significantly
slowing exports to a grain-hungry foreign market.
 They say they amount to de facto export limits even though
the Kiev government said on Wednesday it saw no need at the
moment for formal export quotas, unlike Russia which banned
exports from Aug.15 to curb inflation.
 ""There will be checks on all wheat consignments today and in
the near future without exception,"" the deputy head of Ukraine's
customs service, Serhiy Semka, told Reuters in an interview.
""With time ... these checks could become selective.
 ""If necessary, such measures could be applied to other
cereals,"" he said. Ukraine is world no. 1 exporter of barley and
also exports maize.
 Customs officials imposed additional quality tests for all
wheat exports from Ukraine in July and traders said they were
causing serious delays to Ukrainian wheat shipments.
 But Semka said the checks were ""normal procedure"" and the
drop in export levels was caused by objective factors, not by
customs curbs.
 ""There are no grounds for saying that our activities have
delayed exports. The downward trend of wheat exports does not
depend on customs controls"", he said.
 ""We do not want to give a negative image to traders. What we
are doing is not directed at creating any artificial bans or
limits for wheat exports"", Semka said.
 According to his figures, customs had allowed exports of
about 220,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat so far in August while
shipments of 34,000 tonnes had been blocked after officials, had
found some consignments had been wrongly labelled.
 Semka said some traders tried to pass off milling wheat as
fodder and vice versa.
 Ukraine, the world's sixth largest wheat exporter in the
2009/10 season, sold 1.16 million tonnes of wheat abroad in
August 2009.
 The wheat harvest in the former Soviet republic could fall
to about 17 million tonnes in 2010 from 20.9 million in 2009
after severe frosts in winter and a prolonged heatwave in July
and August.
 The government earlier this month proposed limiting exports
of the two key commodities wheat and barley to 2.5 million
tonnes between September and December following a drought in the
region.
 That followed the ban on grain exports by giant neighbouring
producer Russia which led to soaring grain prices and panic
buying on world markets.
 But on Wednesday the Kiev government said it had put off
introducing curbs on exports because the world market had
settled down after Russia's export ban and the Ukrainian home
market was no longer threatened by over-demand from abroad.
 But traders say the government does not need quotas because
the customs service is already doing the work of the government
by checks which have brought grain shipments to a standstill in
Black Sea and Azov Sea ports.
 Ukraine exported 21.5 million tonnes of grain last season,
including 9.2 million of wheat, 6.2 million of barley and 5.3
million of maize.
 This season, traders forecast exports could fall to about 15
million tonnes, including 5.0 million of wheat, 5.0 million of
barley and 5.0 million of maize if shipments were not subject to
restrictions.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A rally in safe-haven currencies
such as the yen and the Swiss franc stalled on Thursday as
global share prices bounced, although worries about the global
economy slowing down were likely to keep them supported.
 The yen was also weighed down by speculation Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa might comment on the yen or monetary
policy at a Federal Reserve retreat later this week.
 European shares <.FTEU3> rose 0.6 percent, clawing back from
a five-week low on forecast-beating results and tracking a rise
in U.S. and Asian markets. But analysts said the better
sentiment was unlikely to be sustained.
 ""I would expect weaker economic activity to catch up with
stock markets and demand for currencies such as the Swiss franc
and the yen to continue,"" said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy
at ING. 
 Increasing concerns in the past few months about a global
economic slowdown have pushed the yen and Swiss franc higher due
to their perceived safe-haven status. The euro hovered near an
all-time low versus the Swiss franc hit on Wednesday .
 At 1142 GMT, the euro  traded with gains of around 0.2
percent versus the yen  at 107.23 yen, having made a
brief show above 108 yen earlier on a bounce in European stocks
<.FTEU3>. The euro hit a nine-year low on Tuesday at 105.44 yen.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was steady at 1.3035
francs , hovering near an all-time low hit on Wednesday
under 1.3000.
 The euro hit a session high against the dollar  of
$1.2746 before pulling back to around $1.2695. It hovered above
a six-week trough hit earlier in the week.
 Gains in the euro helped push the dollar <.DXY> down 0.3
percent against a currency basket.
 The euro flirted with its 55-day and 100-day moving averages
at $1.2713 and $1.2737 respectively. A close above these levels
would add to upward momentum.
 High-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and
the New Zealand dollar outperformed the euro, aided by the
bounce in equities.
 The dollar was steady versus the yen  at 84.50 yen.
 Earlier this week it hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen as
investors tested whether Japanese authorities would go beyond
trying to talk down the yen.

* Japan jittery about yen but U.S. and Europe less so -source

(Adds background)
 By Gabriella Bruschi
 MILAN, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Joint central bank intervention to
stem the rise of the yen is not likely, and it is more realistic
to expect Japan to act alone, a euro zone source familiar with
the situation said on Thursday.
The yen hit 15-year highs against the dollar earlier this
week but has since pulled back on mounting speculation that
Japanese authorities may intervene for the first time since
March 2004 to stem the yen's rise.
 ""At present it seems more realistic to see a unilateral
intervention on forex markets by the Japanese authorities,"" the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
 ""At the moment I see a lot of jitters in Japan, but I don't
see anything similar in the United States or in the euro zone,""
the source said. ""Clearly the current levels of their respective
currencies are not regarded as being that negative.""
 The source did not entirely rule out co-ordinated
intervention, however, and said that such a case would most
likely involve the Federal Reserve and each central bank acting
on its own currency.
 ""The main focus is the dollar/yen, so one could think that
the United States could possibly act with Japan. An ECB
intervention on the euro/yen seems more difficult, also because
the Japanese currency has more of an impact for the U.S. than
for the euro zone economy.""
 ""Even a possible euro/yen level of 100 should not trouble
the ECB,"" the source added.
 The dollar rose slightly to 84.60 yen on Thursday, having
moved in a narrow range of 84.49-84.90 yen all day. Earlier this
week it hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen.
 The euro also pushed slightly higher against the Japanese
currency at 107.52 yen, extending its recovery from a nine-year
low of 105.44 yen hit on Tuesday.
 Markets have been rife with speculation that the Bank of
Japan will ease monetary policy further before its regular rate
review on Sept. 6-7 at an emergency meeting.
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will attend the
Kansas City Federal Reserve's conference in Jackson Hole in the
United States this week, and analysts say that an emergency
meeting is less likely to take place while he is away.
 Shirakawa, who chairs the BOJ's policy meetings, will return
to Tokyo on Aug. 30.
 Earlier on Thursday, Japan's deputy finance minister
Motohisa Ikeda said the yen's rapid rise was undesirable for the
economy.
 He added that he believed the Bank of Japan would ""make an
appropriate decision on monetary policy based on market and
economic trends.""
 The euro zone source familiar with the situation noted that
coordinated intervention by central banks had been rare in the
past 10 years, adding it was ""a very complex operation that
requires good agreement on what is the right exchange rate.""

331,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2010 06:52AM ET</span>","SNAP ANALYSIS-SAfrica ANC, COSATU need other too much to split"," By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The long alliance between
South Africa's ruling African National Congress and organised
labour has been put through one of its toughest tests by a
massive state workers' strike.
 The country's largest labour federation COSATU on Thursday
said ties were near the breaking point, giving one of its
strongest signals yet that it could sever the alliance forged in
their decades-long struggle to end apartheid.
 The following are some implications of the statement and how
the country's political system, where the ANC is in governing
alliance with unions and the communists, could change.
 
 KISS AND MAKE UP?
 Despite the intense acrimony now, the ANC and COSATU need
each too much for political purposes and will eventually patch
up their differences to maintain some kind of alliance.
 This marriage of convenience comes at high cost because it
delays what analysts say is a much-needed crack down on unions
and introduction of reforms to tackle massive unemployment that
has been dragging down the continent's largest economy.
 Jacob Zuma, who was boosted to the presidency in large part
through the help of organised labour, is not seen by analysts as
decisive enough to break ties with COSATU. But he might bend,
and push them further away from policy decisions.
 COSATU does not have enough members or money to function as
a viable political opposition party and gains far more influence
by keeping its alliance with the ANC.
 But COSATU has proven enormously effective at dragging the
economy to near halts through strikes, meaning the ANC faces
enormous political risks from ostracising its traditional ally.
 
 POLICY CHANGES
 Two policies pushed by COSATU that will likely be given less
prominence are its calls to weaken the rand to boost exports and
for the central bank to scrap inflation targeting to give it
more flexibility in setting interest rates.
 Zuma, who is set for a bruising at the ANC's mid-term policy
setting meeting next month by various factions angered at his
government, would welcome any support. He may cosy up to the
anti-union elements in the party.
 Zuma may reconsider a policy he proposed a few years ago to
ease measures that would allow companies to hire temporary
workers, which economists have said is vital for allowing
greater flexibility in the country's rigid labour market.
 There are also worries about the agenda of anti-union forces
in the ANC who want to keep a system to increase the power of
the black majority over the economy that critics said have
benefitted the politically connected and raised worries of
chronic cronyism.
 
 UNEMPLOYMENT
 Economists said one of the greatest threats to the economy
are rigid labour laws -- favoured by unions -- that make it
difficult for employers to offer low-wages and flexible
employment to the country's poor. These measures could ease the
country's alarmingly high official 25 percent unemployment rate.
 The country's labour laws have been cited as a factor
limiting foreign investment.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday as a
rise in global share prices prompted investors to pick up
riskier currencies, but gains were capped as more weak U.S.
economic data indicated the pace of recovery was slowing.
 The yen slipped, pulling further away from multi-year lows
against the dollar and the euro, as investors speculated whether
Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will comment on the yen
or monetary policy at a Federal Reserve retreat this week.
 European shares rose 0.6 percent, clawing back from a
five-week low on forecast-beating results and tracking a rise in
U.S. and Asian markets.
 ""The market is still looking at stocks and how the ongoing
correlation between risky assets and euro/dollar holds up, and
it still seems to be holding up well,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head
of currency strategy at CIBC.
 He added that ""bottom fishing"" was a driver in the rise in
stock prices after U.S. shares edged up on Wednesday even after
a slide in new home sales and weak durable goods orders.
 Analysts say weak U.S. jobless claims data on Thursday may
press share markets lower, and drive the euro down.
 Increasing concerns about a global economic slowdown in the
past few months have pushed the yen and the Swiss franc higher
due to their perceived safe-haven status. The euro hovered near
an all-time low versus the Swiss franc hit the previous day.
 The euro hit a session high of $1.2746 before pulling back
to around $1.2715 by 1013 GMT. It hovered above a six-week
trough hit earlier in the week.
 Traders said buying by a semi-official European name under
$1.2700 and Middle East demand were supporting the single
currency. Options were due to expire at $1.2700 and this was
helping to keep the single currency around that level.
 Gains in the euro helped push the dollar down 0.4 percent
against a currency basket.
 The euro poked above its 55-day and 100-day moving averages
at $1.2713 and $1.2737 respectively. A close above these levels
would add to upward momentum. Technical analysts saw support at
$1.2605, the 50 percent retracement of its June-July rally.
 Against the yen, the euro traded 0.5 percent higher at
107.52 yen, extending its recovery from a nine-year low of
105.44 yen hit on Tuesday.
 The Japanese currency also slipped against the dollar, which
rose slightly on the day to 84.60 yen, having moved in a narrow
range of 84.49-84.90 yen all day.
 Earlier this week it hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen as
investors tested whether Japanese authorities would go beyond

on short covering due to caution about possible Japanese

 By Peroshni Govender and Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 26 (Reuters) - South Africa's top labour
federation COSATU threatened on Thursday to sever its
long-standing alliance with the ruling African National Congress
and widen a state workers' strike next week to key industries.
 Thousands of striking state workers held marches in major
cities nationwide calling on the government to meet their wage
demands. About 1.3 million unionised employees have walked out
in the standoff, shutting schools and cutting off medical
treatment at hospitals.
 ""The alliance is again dysfunctional,"" COSATU
Secretary-General Zwelinzima Vavi said in a statement. ""The
centre cannot hold.""
 The comments were some of the strongest signals to date that
organised labour, which helped President Jacob Zuma ascend to
the presidency, may be ready to cut, or change, a relationship
with the ANC that was forged in their struggle to end apartheid.
 The state workers' strike has had no major impact on rand
and bond trading but market players said worries would mount if
it extended into September and other labour groups joined in.
 Jasson Urbach, an economist with the Free Market Foundation,
estimated the work stoppage was costing the economy 1.084
billion rand ($147.8 million) a day.
 Police fired rubber bullets when protests turned violent in
Kimberley, about 435 km (270 miles) southwest of Johannesburg,
while rallies slowed traffic to a crawl in major cities.
 COSATU said it filed 7-day strike notices on Thursday so
that all its 2 million members could join the state workers in a
strike they said would also target the mining and manufacturing
sectors, a step which could grind the country to a halt.
 Some analysts believe South Africa could ultimately benefit
from a split between the ANC and COSATU because it would allow
the government to ditch union-friendly policies and reform a
rigid labour market, criticised for restricting investment and
driving up production costs.
 But not all are convinced that the long-time partners will
abandon each other, despite growing acrimony.
 ""The reality of each of these factions is that it is very
difficult for them to break with their ally, however tenuous
that relationship is,"" said Mark Schroeder, a specialist on
Africa for global intelligence company Stratfor.
 
 NOT AFFORDABLE
 On top of the wage dispute, the leader of the ANC's Youth
League Julius Malema fired what amounted to a warning shot at
Zuma on Wednesday, questioning his leadership and implying the
ruling party's youth wing would not support Zuma for a
re-election bid.
 COSATU also wants the government to reverse a 9-billion-rand
deal involving mining giant ArcelorMittal that transfers 26
percent of its local shares to employees and black investors
including a consortium led by Zuma's son, Duduzane.
 ""We are heading rapidly in the direction of a full blown
predator state, in which a powerful, corrupt and demagogic elite
of political hyenas increasingly controls the state,"" Vavi said,
as he took a swipe at Zuma over the heavily criticised deal.
 The government has said it cannot afford the state workers'
demand of an 8.6 percent wage rise, more than double the
inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($136) a month as a housing
allowance. It has offered 7 percent and 700 rand.
 Any agreement to end the dispute is likely to swell state
spending by about 1 to 2 percent, forcing the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 An expanded strike would add to worries about prospects for
growth after the economy slowed more than expected in the second
quarter of 2010 as mining contracted and manufacturing expanded
at a slower pace.
 Separately, the National Union of Mineworkers said it would
consider widening strikes at an Exxaro unit and at a Rio
Tinto-BHP Billiton joint venture unless its demands for higher
wages were met.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday as
early gains in European shares, following a climb on Wall
Street, indicated improving demand for riskier currencies.
 The yen slipped, pulling further away from multi-year lows
against the dollar and the euro, as investors speculated whether
Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will comment on the yen
or monetary policy at a Federal Reserve retreat this week.
 European shares rose 0.8 percent, clawing back from a
five-week low on forecast-beating results, although gains were
capped after U.S. data on Thursday raised concerns the world's
biggest economy risks sliding back into recession.
 A slide in new U.S. home sales and weak durable goods orders
highlighted weakness in the U.S. economy, but analysts said such
data has failed to stoke safe-haven demand for the dollar, as it
did earlier in the month.
 ""Stocks are back despite weak U.S. data,"" said Carl Hammer,
chief currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""The conundrum is what happens to the correlation between
risk appetite and the dollar. I'm not certain we will continue
to see a stronger dollar when the stock market falls.""
 The euro rose 0.6 percent on the day to a session high of
$1.2746. By 0756 GMT, it traded around $1.2710. This helped push
the dollar down 0.4 percent against a currency basket.
 A 0.8 percent rise in European stocks helped the single
currency pull further away from a six-week low of $1.2584,
according to Reuters data, hit earlier this week.
 The euro briefly poked above its 55-day and 100-day moving
averages at $1.2713 and $1.2737 respectively. A close above
these levels on Thursday would add to upward momentum in the
single currency.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.8 percent to the day's high
of 108.02 yen, adding to its recovery from a nine-year low of
105.44 yen hit on Tuesday.
 The Japanese currency also slipped against the dollar, which
rose slightly on the day to 84.73 yen.
 Earlier this week it hit a 15-year low of 83.58 yen as
investors tested Japanese authorities to see whether they would
go beyond trying to talk down the yen.
 On Thursday, traders said the dollar/yen and cross/yen were
rising partly on short-covering due to caution about possible

 Sellers of the greenback are believed to have set stops in
the 85.05-85.10 yen region, and if such orders are triggered it
could boost the dollar back to the 85.60-85.80 area.
 Increasing concerns about a global economic slowdown in the

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - World stocks bounced off
seven-week lows and the euro rose on Thursday in another burst
of the risk-on, risk-off trading that has dominated financial
markets this year.
 Wall Street looked set to open slightly higher.
 MSCI's main gauge of global equities was up 0.5 percent
after hitting its lowest level since July 7 on Wednesday. The
Thomson Reuters global stock index was 0.4 percent higher.
 The global picture was helped along by strong corporate
earnings in Europe, which boosted the FTSEurofirst 300 around
half a percent.
 Both Credit Agricole and L'Oreal beat expectations.
 ""Companies have been reporting reasonable results,"" said
David Buik, partner at BGC Partners. ""But whether a rally can be
sustained is to be seen. There is nothing to say the bad news is
all over.""
 Throughout the northern hemisphere summer, markets have been
balancing good corporate results with signs that growth in the
world-leading U.S. economy is falling back.
 With only a few companies left to report, Thomson Reuters
Proprietary Research shows U.S. S&P 500 had average earnings
growth of 38.4 percent in the recent reporting season.
 Bonds, meanwhile, continued to attract support. German 10
year debt yields remained close to record lows hit on Wednesday
after data showed new U.S. single-family home sales slid to the
slowest pace on record in July and orders for costly durable
goods were weak.
 
 EURO RISES
 The euro rose along with global share prices, but gains were
capped as more weak U.S. economic data indicated the pace of
recovery was slowing.
 The yen was flat to weaker but away from multi-year highs
against the dollar and the euro, as investors speculated whether
Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will comment on the yen

 ""The market is still looking at stocks and how the ongoing
correlation between risky assets and euro/dollar holds up, and
it still seems to be holding up well,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head

 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.3 percent to
82.977. It hit 83.556 on Tuesday, a six-week high.
 The euro rose around 0.3 percent on the day to $1.2695.

 By Maria Plis
 MOSCOW, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Russia's top grocer by sales, X5
, stuck to its 2010 goals after a weak rouble pulled its
second-quarter profit below forecasts, as recovering margins
gave investors heart.
 Net profit fell 81 percent to $24.9 million from $130.4
million a year ago, the company said in a statement on Thursday,
falling short of the Reuters poll forecast of $37.2 million.
 The bottom line was dented by a $72 million foreign exchange
loss ""due to significant rouble depreciation"" X5 said.
 The rouble weakened by nearly 6 percent versus the dollar
during the second quarter, hurt by a retreat in the price of
oil, a key source of cash for the Russian economy.
 In the first three months a stronger domestic currency had
in fact boosted the retailer's results by making it cheaper to
buy foreign imports.
 Net sales rose 25 percent in dollar terms to $2.64 billion,
broadly in line with analysts' estimates.
 X5 reiterated its 2010 sales growth and capital expenditure
outlook given in May. At the time, the group, 47.9 percent owned
by billionaire Mikhail Fridman's empire Alfa Group, trimmed its
2010 sales growth outlook to ""in the low-20 percent range"",
citing low food price inflation.
 ""We expect consumer spending to begin to show improvement
towards the end of the year, and this, in combination with new
store openings and post-integration contribution from Paterson
(supermarket chain) in the second half of 2010, should enable X5
to deliver on its objectives,"" the company said.
 By 1405 GMT, X5's GDRs were up 1 percent in London, while
Moscow's MICEX index had added 1.5 percent.
 ""A slight beat on ... margins and confirmed guidance coming
on the back of (rival) Magnit's miss and reduced guidance
earlier this week should support X5's shares in the short term,""
analysts at Citi said in a research note.
 The company, which has over 1,500 shops across Russia, was
one of the first to cut prices to win increasingly
cost-conscious customers as Russia slipped into its deepest
recession in 15 years. It is now reaping some benefits from the
economic recovery, and margins have started to improve.
 The earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) margin rose to 8.3 percent in the second
quarter from 7 percent in the first quarter, though it was still
below the year-ago level of 8.7 percent.
 Rival Magnit, which started cutting prices much later, on
Tuesday posted a slightly smaller than expected net profit and
deteriorating margins.

quarter
 * Not advantageous to have rates at such low levels
(Adds quotes, background)
 PRAGUE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank governing
board is certain to debate interest rate levels in the fourth
quarter, and the period of low rates and their decline has
ended, a Czech central banker was quoted as saying on Thursday.
 Czech borrowing costs are at a record low, with the main
two-week repo rate   at 0.75 percent, the
lowest policy rate in the region and below the European central
bank's benchmark rate of 1 percent.
 ""It is certain that members of the board will debate the
level of interest rates in the fourth quarter,"" daily
Hospodarske Noviny quoted board member Kamil Janacek as saying.
 ""It is certain that the period of low interest rates and
their lowering in this economy has ended.""
 The bank forecasts the three-month interbank rate PRIBOR,
which closely correlates with the main policy rate, the repo
rate. The latest forecast released on Aug 5 showed rate
stability before a gradual rise around the middle of 2011.
 But Janacek, who was appointed to the seven-strong
governing board as of July 1, said it was not desirable for the
Czech economy to have rates at such a low level.
 ""For this economy it is not advantageous to have rates set
up in this way. It can cause an outflow of capital from the
Czech Republic,"" the daily quoted him as saying.
 ""Keeping low, or even negative real interest rates for a
long period of time is not possible. The normal situation is to
have moderately positive real interest rates which prevent
creation of bubbles in financial markets.""
 How long the Czech economy could maintain rates below those
of the European central bank was also a question, he said.
 Fellow board member Eva Zamrazilova said on Tuesday she
wanted to discuss a rate rise ""very soon"" and she was, in
general, against the policy of low interest rates.
[ID:nLDE67N075]
 Janacek told the daily the Czech economy could expand at a
4 percent clip ""in the horizon of three to four years"" if the
new centre-right cabinet succeeds in its plan to reform the
budget, pensions and healthcare.
 The cabinet plans far-reaching spending cuts to bring the
total fiscal gap to the level of 3 percent required by the EU
by 2013, from 5.3 percent seen this year.
 The bank sees GDP expanding by 1.6 percent this year after
a 4.0 percent annual contraction in 2009.

(Adds CEO quotes, analyst comment, background)
 By Lionel Laurent
 PARIS, Aug 26 (Reuters) - French bank Credit Agricole is set
to unveil a two-part strategic plan as its new management tries
to bolster investor confidence in the face of fragile economic
recovery and tighter bank regulation.
 Newly appointed Chief Executive Jean-Paul Chifflet and
Chairman Jean-Marie Sander on Thursday said at a news conference
they would reveal a ten-year strategic plan in December,
followed by a more precise three-year plan in March.
 ""It is not a matter of giving precise numbers but more broad
outlines,"" said Chifflet, after the bank reported second-quarter
results that soundly beat expectations and gave a fillip to its
underperforming share price.
 The bank also confirmed that talks were ongoing with China's
Citic to ink a brokerage joint venture, and it would be ""open""
to a deal with Unicredit asset management unit Pioneer.
Management stayed tight-lipped on its broader acquisition
strategy.
 Shares of Credit Agricole were up 2.5 percent, at 10.15
euros by 1525 GMT, better than a 1.2 percent rise for the
broader STOXX Europe bank index. Year to date, however, Credit
Agricole's shares have underperformed the sector.
 The new team has inherited a tough environment in Greece,
where Credit Agricole's unit Emporiki is struggling to recover,
as well as the threat of tighter capital requirements under
""Basel III"". Both issues will continue to weigh on the share
price going forward, analysts say.
 Chairman Sander, who is also mayor of the small commune in
the northeastern Alsace region where he was born, is ""confident""
in the ability of management to meet the challenges, he told
Reuters on the sidelines of the conference. ""It's a collegial
atmosphere, with everyone contributing their part,"" he said.
 
 BASEL FEARS
 Credit Agricole posted an 89 percent rise in second-quarter
net profit to 379 million euros ($483 million), beating
analysts' expectations, after corporate finance and insurance
helped offset losses at Emporiki.
 Larger rivals BNP Paribas and Societe Generale also reported
better-than-expected results for the quarter. Both banks, along
with Credit Agricole and Natixis parent BPCE, passed Europe-wide
stress tests in July.
 Credit Agricole's second-quarter revenue of 5.5 billion
euros was also better than forecast, while provisions fell by
more than expected to 980 million thanks to a more benign market
environment since the recent financial crisis.
 But the economic environment in Europe, particularly in
Greece, will likely put the brakes on more significant falls in
provisions going forward.
 CEO Chifflet said in a statement the second quarter was
marked by a climate of ""persistent uncertainty and economic
weakness"". He later told a conference call the tough second
quarter meant the bank was cautious on the rest of 2010.
 ""On the whole we are not worried ... But we are taking a
prudent stance regarding loan provisions,"" he said.
 Analysts said while Credit Agricole's results showed
positive trends in corporate finance, retail banking and
insurance, struggling Greek unit Emporiki's losses and concerns
over looming Basel III capital requirements were still there.
 Credit Agricole shares have fallen 17.2 percent year to
date, underperforming a 5 percent drop in bank index.
 ""Today is a better place than yesterday for Credit Agricole
because they've beaten expectations ... But we don't move
forward on the key issue which is capital under Basel III,"" a
London-based analyst said.
 Analysts have said Credit Agricole may be considered to be
short of cash under the forthcoming capital requirement rules,
due to its complicated cross-shareholdings with parent regional
banks and sizeable insurance capital that may no longer be
wholly counted as Tier 1 capital in the new regime.
 Chief Financial Officer Bertrand Badre said on the
conference call the bank would be open to taking on more
leverage at its insurance unit to release capital but it would
wait for the final rules to be confirmed later this year.
 
 PIONEER INTEREST
 CEO Chifflet also said the bank was looking closely at the
sale of Unicredit's asset management subsidiary Pioneer.
 Amundi, the asset management joint venture of Credit
Agricole and Societe Generale, is said to have put in an
unsolicited bid, but has not confirmed this.
 ""We are interested in what is happening ... We are waiting
for a firm position on their (Unicredit) part,"" said Chifflet.
Amundi CEO Yves Perrier said the unit would be ""open"" to a deal
without confirming its interest.
 There have been a number of unsolicited approaches for
Pioneer and Natixis CEO Laurent Mignon has said he would be open
to striking a deal, most likely a sales partnership, with
Pioneer.

 * Still no decision on China currency subsidy probe
 * Commerce officials highlight 3 of 14 proposals
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department
plans to toughen rules against what it sees as unfair foreign
trade practices that threaten U.S. jobs, senior department
officials said in advance of new proposals coming on Thursday.
 At least one of the 14 ideas under discussion could lead to
higher duties on China, which has been the most frequent target
of U.S. complaints about unfair trade in recent years.
 But the plan seeks to strengthen the effectiveness of U.S.
trade protection measures ""across a range of areas,"" a senior
Commerce Department official told Reuters. ""This is a process
that will play out during the course of the fall.""
 Commerce Secretary Gary Locke ordered a review of the
department's rules and procedures governing anti-dumping and
countervailing duties as part President Barack Obama's
initiative to double exports in five years.
 Conspicuously missing from the new proposals is a decision
on whether to investigate China's exchange rate practices as an
unfair foreign subsidy, a diplomatically explosive issue before
the department in two pending trade cases.
 Many lawmakers and manufacturers say China's ""undervalued""
currency gives it an unfair price advantage in global markets.
The department has been mulling for months whether it has a
strong legal grounding to investigate the charge.
 Rollout of the new proposals follows a recent Commerce
Department report showing that imports surged unexpectedly in
June, one of many indicators that have raised concern about the
strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
 Heading into November congressional elections, the Obama
administration also has an incentive to appear tough on trade
to help Democrats in vulnerable
seats.
 However, less than 3 percent of imports into the United
States are hit with anti-dumping or countervailing duties, so
the proposed changes would affect a small portion of trade.
 Department officials spotlighted three proposals they
believed would have the most impact.
 One would require importers to pay a cash deposit to cover
preliminary duties once they are announced.
 Currently, importers have the option of posting bonds at a
fraction of their liability for the five or six months until
final duties are set.
 PROPOSAL TARGETS CHINA
 That has led to problems collecting the full amount the
government is owed, department officials said.
 ""We think this is a way to better ensure that companies
that ... may ultimately be liable for a dumping duty actually
have the wherewithal to pay,"" a department official said.
 A second proposed change would allow the department to
subtract Chinese export taxes when calculating the size of
anti-dumping or countervailing duties.
 That is common practice now for unfairly traded goods from
""market economies"" like Japan and countries in Europe. But it
has not been the case for ""non-market economies"" like China on
the theory the taxes are too hard to measure.
 China will ""undoubtedly"" be upset by the proposal because
it will lead to higher duties on its goods, the Commerce
Department official said.
 The third major proposal would stop the practice of
removing individual foreign companies from anti-dumping orders
if they can show during three annual administrative reviews
they haven't dumped products in the United States.
 Such companies could still receive a zero duty rate under
the new proposal. But they would remain subject to the order,
keeping them on notice that their duty could be increased if
Commerce finds new evidence of unfair trading.
 ""This provides us with more of a guarantee that we can have
better surveillance of the effectiveness of the order,"" the
Commerce Department official said.
 A trade attorney briefed by Reuters on the proposed changes
described them as long overdue and said he was confident none
of them violated World Trade Organization rules.
 ""I think they will be helpful to domestic industries who
are having problems with unfair foreign trade practices,"" said
Paul Rosenthal, managing partner at the Washington office of
Kelley Drye and Warren, which has represented many clients
seeking trade relief.
 They should not lead to a surge of new anti-dumping or
countervailing duty cases, but will improve the effectiveness
of relief when it is provided, he said.

 * Japan govt to urge BOJ to ease monetary policy -media
 * Speculators trim yen bets on intervention caution
 * Dollar under pressure after weak goods orders, housing data
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The yen slipped further from a
15-year high against the dollar as investors wait to see if
Japanese authorities will go beyond trying to just talk down the
currency.
 The greenback was under pressure after U.S. data on Wednesday
heightened fears the world's biggest economy is at risk of
another downturn. New home sales slumped to the slowest pace on
record in July and durable goods orders were weaker than
expected.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a basket
of six major currencies, edged down 0.3 percent to 83.035.
Support is seen at the Aug. 24 low of 82.86 and the 82.00 level,
while resistance stands at 83.556, a six-week high hit on
Tuesday.
 The euro further recovered from a nine-year trough against
the yen after data on Wednesday showed business morale in Germany
improved to its highest in more than three years in August,
offsetting concerns about fiscally weak euro zone countries.
 News that Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will
attend the Kansas City Federal Reserve conference in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, this week was making some players hesitant to push
the yen higher.
 ""Investors are cautiously watching whether Japanese
authorities will do something,"" said Hideki Amikura, deputy
general manager of the forex section at Nomura Trust and Banking.
 ""Shirakawa is likely to speak to (Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben) Bernanke and other central bankers in Jackson Hole, and that
is prompting market players to speculate about possible Japanese
action.""
 The Japanese government will urge the BOJ to ease monetary
policy further to ease the pain in the economy from a strong yen
in an economic stimulus package now being worked out, the Asahi
newspaper said on Thursday.
 The dollar edged up 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade to 84.71
yen after climbing as high as 84.89 yen earlier in the day. The
greenback posted a 15-year trough of 83.58 yen on trading
platform EBS on Tuesday.
 The euro climbed 0.5 percent on the day to 107.55 yen. The
single currency plunged as low as 105.44 yen on Tuesday, its
lowest since 2001.
 COULD EXPORTER YEN DEMAND OFFSET JAPAN ACTION?
 Traders said rises in the dollar/yen and cross/yen were led
by speculators' short-covering due to caution about possible
Japanese intervention, while many investors stayed on the
sidelines.
 Talk has been growing that Japan may intervene to stem the
yen's rise for the first time since March 2004 as the currency
nears an all-time high of 79.75 yen to the dollar hit in 1995,
pushing the Nikkei average down to 16-month lows.
 Sellers of the greenback are believed to have set stops in
the 85.05-85.10 yen region, and if such orders are triggered it
could boost the dollar back to the 85.60-85.80 area.
 Meanwhile, Japanese exporters, having missed the chance to
repatriate overseas profits before the recent spike in the yen,
are keenly watching for the right time to sell dollars and euros,
traders said.
 ""Talk in the market is that exporters have not been able to
bring themselves to sell foreign currencies at current levels,""
said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the foreign securities
department at Okasan Securities.
 ""But they are expected to sell the dollar when it rebounds
beyond 85.00 and 86.00 yen.""
 Guessing how badly exporters may need to sell foreign
currencies, some suggest that exporter selling of dollars and
euros could offset Japanese authorities' efforts to weaken the
yen, even if Japan finally acts, traders say.
 Against the greenback, the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.2695,
having rebounded from a six-week low of $1.2588 hit earlier this
week.

 TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday as
investors hunted for bargains among recently beaten-down

investors wondered whether Japanese officials would take fresh
steps to curb the currency's strength and spur economic growth.

economy.
 Exposure to riskier assets continued to weigh on markets

players said was short-covering and buying of futures by
long-term domestic investors, after hitting a 16-month closing

 Japan has also not ruled out market intervention to weaken
the yen, though markets largely doubt such a move or further
symbolic BOJ policy easing would have much effect.
 The benchmark Nikkei broke below 9,000 this week for the
first time since May 2009. The 9,000 to 9,100 area had been
strong support since last year, and market players say there
will be few technical targets to break the benchmark's further
falls.
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose more than half a percent, led by consumer

held up better than the all-country world index, which has
fallen 7 percent <.MIWD00000PUS>.
 Asia's strong economic growth apart from Japan has been a
buffer against recent global shocks, with emerging markets

growing.
 The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield
 rose 4 basis points to 0.940 percent on falls in
U.S. Treasury prices and profit-taking, but analysts said they
expect yields to remain on a downtrend on lingering easing
hopes.
 U.S. crude oil  rose for a second day, nearing $73 a
barrel, as bargain-hunting and short-covering in equities
spread to the oil market.
 Gold  edged up to $1,240.95 an ounce, after hitting
its strongest level in eight weeks on persistent worries the

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The yen slipped further away from a
15-year high against the dollar as investors waited to see if
Japanese authorities would act beyond intervening verbally to
rein in gains in the yen.
 The greenback was under pressure after U.S. data the previous
day heightened fears the world's biggest economy was at risk of
another downturn. New home sales slumped to the slowest pace on
record in July and durable goods orders were weaker than expected
in the same month.
 The euro further recovered from a nine-year trough against
the yen after data showed on Wednesday business morale in Germany
improved to its highest in more than three years in August,
offsetting concerns about fiscally weak euro zone countries.
 News that Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will
attend the Kansas City Federal Reserve conference in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, this week was making some players hesitant to push
the yen higher, analysts said.
 ""Investors are cautiously watching whether Japanese
authorities will do something,"" said Hideki Amikura, deputy
general manager of the forex section at Nomura Trust and Banking.
 ""Shirakawa is likely to speak to (Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben) Bernanke and other central bankers in Jackson Hole, and that
is prompting market players to speculate about possible Japanese
action.""
 The Japanese government will urge the BOJ to ease monetary
policy further to ease the pain in the economy from a strong yen
in an economic stimulus package now being worked out, the Asahi
newspaper said on Thursday.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade to 84.77
yen, having risen from a 15-year trough of 83.58 yen struck on
trading platform EBS on Tuesday.
 The euro climbed 0.4 percent on the day to 107.48 yen. The
single currency plunged as low as 105.44 yen on Tuesday, its
lowest since 2001.
 Against the greenback, the euro inched up 0.1 percent to
$1.2676, staying above a 6-week low of $1.2588 hit earlier this

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar held near
seven-week lows against the greenback on Wednesday as weak U.S.
economic data added to worries about the recovery, though a
late rebound in commodity and equity markets cut most of the
currency's early losses.
 Morning figures showed new U.S. home sales slumped to their
slowest pace on record in July and orders for costly durable
goods were soft, heightening fears the economy was at risk of a
new downturn. [ID:nN25121445]
 The Canadian dollar crept as low as C$1.0669 to the U.S.
dollar, or 93.73 U.S. cents, after the durable goods data,
before building back up.
 Later in day, bargain hunters in search of beaten-down
assets boosted U.S. stocks to finish in positive territory,
while oil settled higher above $72 a barrel, snapping five days
of losses. [.N] [O/R]
 ""Since weakening early this morning (the Canadian dollar)
started to strengthen throughout the day at a slow pace,"" said
Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 ""And it's been a similar story across asset classes, so
we've seen oil move higher and equities make up for their
losses early on.""
 The currency  closed the North American session at
C$1.0608 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.27 U.S. cents, only slightly
below Tuesday's close at C$1.0603 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.31
U.S. cents.
 However, Sutton pointed out that the general tone of the
day was still downbeat.
 ""The overall developments were negative for the U.S. growth
story and by default the Canadian growth story,"" she said.
 ""What we have going on right now is a somewhat
unsynchronized recovery where emerging markets are still poised
to do fairly well whereas developed markets or G3 are poised
for sub-trend growth.""
 Overnight, risk aversion was fed by a one-notch downgrade
to ""AA-"" of Ireland's long-term rating by credit agency
Standard & Poor's on Tuesday. The downgrade reignited concerns
about Europe, although a German Ifo business climate index
climbed in August and exceeded expectations. [ID:nLDE67O0Y]
[ID:nLDE67O0OB]
 Looking to the overnight session and possibly to Thursday,
Sutton said support and resistance for the Canadian dollar
should rest between C$1.0580 to C$1.0695.
 BONDS KEEP UP RALLY
 Bond prices rallied on declining expectations of a third
straight rate hike by the Bank of Canada next month. The
central bank has raised rates twice since the start of June,
but disappointing data has hit yields on overnight index swaps
for the Sept. 8 decision.
 Those yields, which trade based on market expectations for
the central bank's key policy rate, held around a 31 percent
chance of a rate hike, as calculated by Reuters. 
 The two-year bond  advanced 5 Canadian cents to
yield 1.224 percent, while the 10-year bond  rose 7
Canadian cents to yield 2.832 percent.
 ""The bond market has been a microcosm of excitement,"" said
Eric Lascelles, chief Canada macro strategist at TD
Securities.
 ""On an absolute basis, bonds are still awfully rich right
now. Yields are still astonishingly low so the market is
running into a bit of resistance to go much further.""
However, Canada's auction of 30-year real return bonds met
with lukewarm demand as investors were less convinced that
lower-yielding inflation-protected debt was the place to be at
a time of worry about anemic global economic growth.
[ID:nN25138272]
 ""Fear of high inflation is off the table and fear of
deflation, disinflation is on the rise, so real return bonds
are not perceived to offer quite the safety that was once
imagined,"" Lascelles added, noting that the once-popular real
return bonds have underperformed nominal bonds over the last
several months.
 As well, the province of Ontario sold C$750 million in a
reopening of existing 4.2 percent 10-year notes and the
province of Prince Edward Island sold C$100 million of 3.7
percent 10-year notes. [ID:nN25120396] [ID:nN25128193]

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen pulled back from
15-year highs against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday on mounting
speculation that Japanese authorities may intervene to stem the
currency's rise for the first time since March 2004.
 Japan has not been immune to the deep global recession, and
a strong yen will dampen demand for Japanese exports,
offsetting other measures to stimulate the economy.
 The euro recovered from a nine-year low against the yen,
supported by strong German economic data. The dollar remained
under pressure after weaker-than-expected U.S. durable goods
orders and a dive in new home sales in July, despite gains on
the day against the yen.
 Traders were reluctant to keep betting on further yen gains
after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated he
would respond to yen moves when necessary. His comments
followed a Nikkei newspaper report that his ministry may
consider unilateral yen-selling intervention.
 On Tuesday the dollar posted its worst day versus the yen
since May while the euro broke under a key resistance level.
 ""Nothing in Japanese politics or the economy warrants the
fundamental strength of the yen,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief
analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey. ""It is
almost purely a case of fear in world markets.""
 Trevisani said dollar/yen should be trading around 105 yen
based on analysis of the relative economic fundamentals.
 News that Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will
attend an annual U.S. Federal Reserve conference in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, this week was also making some investors wary of
buying yen, analysts said.
 Some analysts said Shirakawa's travel plans had increased
speculation that Japanese authorities may be preparing to act
on the yen. At the same time, others argue the central bank is
unlikely to hold an emergency policy meeting in his absence.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar was up
0.8 percent on the day to 84.63 yen, though still within reach
of the 15-year low touched on Tuesday, according to Reuters
data.
 Traders said there was higher demand for short-term
dollar/yen options with an 85.00 yen strike price as
intervention jitters increased.
 Demand for the dollar had briefly faltered after reports
showed new orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose
far less than expected in July. Excluding transportation,
orders posted the biggest fall since January 2009.
 Another report showed new U.S. single-family home sales
fell in July to the slowest pace on record.
 ""Clearly the economy is slowing markedly, and it's a
broad-based slowdown,"" said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 ""It'll be difficult for the dollar to rally against the yen
in this environment, though it's worth noting that yen gains on
the crosses -- against the euro, sterling and elsewhere -- have
been even more remarkable.""
 EURO SEE-SAWS
 The euro traded 0.9 percent higher at 107.05 yen, though
the euro zone single currency was down from the day's high of
107.66 yen.
 Against the dollar, the euro was 0.2 percent higher on the
day at $1.2651 after trading as high as $1.2725.
 Analysts said optimism from German data showing that
business morale hit a more than three-year high in August was
offset by concerns about fiscally weak euro zone countries,
reflected in a wider yield spread between 10-year Irish and
German bonds.
 The yields were at their widest since May.
 Standard & Poor's on Tuesday downgraded its rating on
Ireland one notch to AA-minus with a negative outlook, fanning
worries about euro zone sovereign debt and the banking system.
 Risk aversion supported the Swiss franc and drove the euro
to a lifetime low of 1.2971 francs on EBS and 1.2973 on
Reuters.
 The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 1.0302 francs with the
session low at 1.0250 francs, a seven-month low.

 * CDU says euro zone debt must carry haircut risk in future
(Adds CDU on debt issuance, quotes, details)
 By Paul Carrel and Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The euro is trading in a
""reasonable range"" and markets have accepted the decisions
taken by policymakers to support the European single currency,
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday.
 He also said the German economy was on a good path even if
economic growth would be a bit lower next year. Positive
economic indicators had shown the German government's
recession-fighting policies were right, he added.
 ""We're going in the right direction,"" Schaeuble told the
foreign press association in Berlin. ""We've got a good
development with the economy and on the labour market. But I'd
also like to point out that in the last quarter we had more
imports than in any quarter in German history.""
 Schaeuble said markets were showing acceptance for what had
been done in support of the single currency. ""The euro has been
trading in a reasonable range,"" he said.
 Separately, a senior member of Schaeuble's conservative
Christian Democrats (CDU) said investors in euro zone sovereign
debt issued after a 750 billion euro rescue mechanism for the
single currency expires in 2013 should face the risk of a
""haircut"" to help protect the euro against future crises.
 Schaeuble also said good progress was being made on
developing common European financial regulations and that a
bank restructuring law backed by the German cabinet on
Wednesday would help prevent future crises.
 ""The bank restructuring measure passed by the government is
a further, important step on the way to learning lessons from
the financial crisis,"" he said.
 ""In principle we need to do two things,"" he added. ""First,
we've got to reduce the high public deficits in all countries
-- and the German government is on the right path there. And
the second thing we have to do is regulation.
 ""We're working on a common European solution and the
efforts are making good progress,"" he said.
 Germany, which has shouldered the biggest share of risks in
a bailout of Greece and the package assembled to protect the
euro currency, has been pushing for the creation of a mechanism
to allow the ""orderly insolvency"" of member states.
 The euro rescue mechanism is due to run out in mid-2013,
and Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition is eager
to avoid German taxpayers being left on the hook again for
other countries' debts.
 Any sovereign debt issued by euro zone members after the
mechanism expires should carry the risk for investors of a
haircut, or discount, if the issuers become insolvent, said
Norbert Barthle, the CDU's budgetary spokesman.
 Germany would press for legal steps to be taken to enable
this in the 16-nation currency bloc, he said.
 Barthle said the prospect of potential haircuts on debt was
vital to discourage member states from losing control of their
finances and putting the single currency under threat.
 ""This was discussed as a potential option during the
crisis,"" he told Reuters. ""Once the rescue mechanism runs out,
corresponding regulations must take effect.""

356,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2010 03:04PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-September numbers suggest volatile month ahead," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Investors hoping for clarity
within financial markets next month after a summer of risk-on,
risk-off drift may get more than they are bargaining for --
September is as much about major losses as it is gentle gains.
 Data from Thomson Reuters Datastream, furthermore, shows
that within this volatility, September is on average the worst
month of the year for developed market equities.
 With movements among assets highly correlated at the moment,
this has even greater implications than normal for currencies,
government bonds and corporate debt, as well as for stocks.
 The correlation between developed market stocks and the
Japanese yen/Australian dollar, for example, has been above 0.8
during the latest three months, roughly meaning that every time
stocks rise or fall so does the Aussie against the yen and
vice-versa.
 Over the past 30 years, the MSCI World index of developed
stocks has lost an average of 0.9 percent in September, compared
with a loss of 0.2 percent in June and gains in every other
month. April is the best, up 2.5 percent.
 Burrowing further down into the data shows that September
has actually been an up month slightly more than half the time,
or in 17 out of 30 years.
 But its average has been dragged down by at least seven
black Septembers, with losses ranging from 4 percent to 12
percent.
 Some of these have been specifically event-driven -- 9/11,
the collapse of Lehman Brothers and so on. Analysts note,
however, that September is also the month when investors
reassess their portfolios after the northern hemisphere summer
break.
""People do come back and realise that things are worse than
when they went away in the summer, or have not improved,"" said
Andrew Clare, professor of asset management at Cass Business
School in London.
 With the U.S. economy struggling more than it was a few
months ago -- a condition corroborated by the Federal Reserve
itself -- this does not bode well for risk in the coming month.
 
 BACK TO WORK
 The significance of September over other months is that it
is supposed to be the time that investors get back to work after
the summer break and volumes pick up.
 The old British market adage ""Sell in May and go away. Stay
away till St Legers Day"" hints at this, given that the St Leger
horse race, first run the year the U.S. Declaration of
Independence was signed, is run this year on Sept. 11.
 There are mixed reviews of how good a market guide the adage
is, but there is little doubt that September does see the return
of volume to markets.
 Again looking at the last 30 years, Thomson Reuters data
shows an average jump of 13.6 percent in trading volume on
Datastream's combined U.S. and European stock indexes between
August and September.
 Volume itself, however, does not tell investors anything
about direction -- December is one of the best for returns, for
example, but volume typically falls from the previous month.
 It does mean, however, that the sharp movements sometimes
seen in lower-volume July and August are not as exaggerated.
 ""In thin markets the slightest bit of activity can push them
one way or another,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at
wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.
 ""All of this comes to an end (in September).""
 
 SIGNALLING...
 So history suggests that September is volatile and can see
major losses on stock markets that in current conditions would
be likely to hit other riskier assets as well.
 It also suggests that some volume will return, easing the
exaggerated moves that can occur in summer.
 But does the month tell us anything about what to expect in
the following quarter?
 The answer to that is not clear cut. Comparing developed
stock market gains and losses in September with those in the
fourth quarter over the past 30 years comes up with a small,
positive correlation of 0.2.
 This means that more often than not what happens in
September also occurs in Q4, but not in a way that provides any
certainty.
 Interestingly, however, the correlation over the past 10
years is twice as strong, at 0.4.
 So, buckle up for September, it could be a meaningful ride.

357,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2010 02:04PM ET</span>",Study links severe drug reaction to herpes virus," * Rare reaction may be result of virus being reactivated
 * Reaction can be prompted by antibiotics and epilepsy drugs
 
 By Kate Kelland
 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - A rare and dangerous reaction to
a range of common medicines including antibiotics and
anticonvulsants may be caused by a severe immune response to
reactivated herpes virus, scientists said on Wednesday.
 Researchers said their findings suggest that if doctors were
to test for the herpes virus in patients suffering the drug
reaction, they might be able to find ways to treat it and
possibly stop it becoming more severe, or even fatal.
 The results should also help scientists find out what makes
some people susceptible to the reaction, which is known as Drug
Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms, or DRESS, and
affects around one in 8,000 people who take the common
medicines.
 In a study into DRESS, also sometimes known as Drug-Induced
Hypersensitivity Syndrome (DIHS), French scientists found the
condition is actually an immune reaction prompted when a dormant
virus is reactivated and the body's fighter T cells go into
overdrive to fight it.
 ""It looks a bit like an autoimmune disease (in which the
body attacks itself), but it's not really an autoimmune disease
because the target (of the immune response) is a actually a
reactivated virus,"" said Philippe Musette of France's National
Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), who worked
on the study with other colleagues in Rouen.
 The main drugs that cause DRESS are anticonvulsants, often
used for epilepsy, including carbamazepine, sold as Carbatrol by
Shire, valproate, sold by Abbott Laboratories as Depakine and
Sanofi-Aventis as Epilim, Lamictal from GlaxoSmithKline,
Novartis' Trileptal and Pfizer's Neurontin.
 
 FIGHTER CELLS
 The reaction, which often appears in patients several weeks
after using a medicine, can also be caused by a generic gout
drug called allopurinol and by some antibiotics, including
sulfamethoxazole and minocycline, which is sold by Medicis
Pharmaceutical Corp under the brand name Solodyn.
 DRESS typically causes a combination of high fever, skin
rash and inflammation of one or more organs, including the
liver, kidneys, lungs and sometimes the heart. Around 10 percent
of patients who develop DRESS die from it.
 Musette's team studied 40 patients who had developed DRESS
drug reactions and found they had an excess of activated killer
T cells -- fighter cells crucial to the body's immune system --
which were mistakenly attacking their own organs.
 To figure out what prompts the immune system to go into
battle so fiercely, the researchers tested whether the patients
showed any viral reactivation -- a development that had been
previously noticed in some DRESS sufferers.
 Their results, which were published in the journal Science
Translational Medicine, showed that 76 percent of their study
patients showed activation of previously dormant herpes virus. 
 ""These results suggest that certain drugs may reactivate
latent viruses lurking in patients' cells, sounding an alarm
that triggers the release of killer immune cells that end up
misguidedly attacking the body's own organs,"" the scientists
wrote in a report of their work.
 Musette said the findings also suggested doctors should test
for herpes virus in every suspected DRESS patient and then try
treating them with anti-herpes drugs or drugs which stop viruses
from being reactivated, although he said much more research was
needed into the type of medicines that might work.
 ""We can try anti-herpes drugs and treatments that inhibit
viral reactivation, but that research has still to be done,"" he
said.

 (Adds comments from second watchdog)
 By Aleksandras Budrys
 MOSCOW, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Russia may take action against
imports of U.S. poultry unless it receives more assurance that
the birds are not contaminated with salmonella, the head of
consumer protection watchdog RosPotrebNadzor told RIA news
agency on Wednesday.
 The USA Poultry and Egg Export Council on Tuesday assured
Russia that U.S. poultry is safe and not affected by the
salmonella outbreak that has forced the recall of more than a
half billion U.S. table eggs.
But RosPotrebNadzor's Gennady Onishchenko said this was not
sufficient.
 ""We would like to receive an official response from the U.S.
Agriculture Ministry as a state entity authorised to respond to
the Russian side,"" he said. Failing that, the watchdog retains
the right to take ""adequate measures"", RIA reported.
 Russia recently began accepting U.S. poultry after banning
it for much of the year, because the use of a chlorine
disinfectant violated its food safety policy. U.S. producers
shipping to Russia now use a different disinfectant.
 Alexei Alexeyenko, a spokesman for the RosSelkhozNadzor
animal and plant health watchdog, told Reuters that so far there
had been no decision to suspend the imports again.
 ""We have not taken any decision yet. We are assessing the
risks,"" he said.
 ""We are very happy that we are cooperating constructively
with U.S. businesses. They have provided us with documents that
permitted the reopening of exports. What we are not happy about
is that the U.S. government has failed to provide us with state
meat safety guarantees,"" Alexeyenko added.
 When asked if Onishchenko's RosPotrebNadzor consumer
protection watchdog was in a position to block exports, he said:
""Theoretically, yes. Like in the chlorine wash case"".
 The safety responsibilities of the two watchdogs overlap in
some cases, such as certain foodstuffs, including poultry meat.

 By John Acher
 COPENHAGEN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The prime minister of
Greenland said on Wednesday that positive exploration findings
off the west coast of the island were far from proof of oil
reserves and that Greenlanders needed to be patient.
 Britain's Cairn Energy said on Tuesday it was encouraged by
the discovery of small quantities of gas, although it did not
strike oil.
 Investors in Edinburgh-based Cairn had hoped for a huge oil
discovery in the Baffin Sea between Greenland and Canada.
 Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist, whose government has self-rule
as part of the Kingdom of Denmark, told journalists in the
Danish capital that Cairn's findings were ""positive indications
but far from proof of finding oil"".
 The Cairn well was the first out of four planned exploratory
drillings, he said. ""The findings are of course positive
indications that there might be some sort of hydrocarbon
deposits under the sea.""
 But Kleist said he was not counting on oil income ""for the
next years"". He declined to be more specific on the time frame.
 He said he believed oil would be found one day and become a
source of export income that would lessen Greenland's one-sided
dependence on fish. Greenland also depends heavily on handouts
from Denmark.
 ""We usually say it is a question of time before some kind of
deposit of oil is found in Greenland,"" he said.
 But he said Greenlanders also needed to be patient -- ""We
need to calm down a little bit"" -- and he noted that Cairn's
well was only the eighth drilled off Greenland, whereas a few
hundred were drilled before oil was found in the North Sea.
 
 NORWEGIAN STANDARDS
 Kleist said that exploration was also being affected by
concerns stemming from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
 ""We know that we are taking a huge responsibility on our
shoulders. We don't claim that there is no risk, but we are
trying to do our best, looking at best practices wherever they
might be and learning from the Norwegian experience,"" he said.
 ""We stick to Norwegian standards known as the world's most
protective standards (for oil operations),"" he said.
 Kleist said that Greenlanders supported oil activities. ""I
would claim that the Greenland people definitely support the
initiatives we have taken in this area.""
 Greenpeace said earlier this week that a Danish navy vessel
blocked its ship Esperanza outside a security zone around
Cairn's rig.
 ""Greenland's interest in this is that the exploration
drilling be carried out under safety standards that do not pose
risk for the environment or employees (aboard the rig),"" the
prime minister said.
 Kleist, who became premier when his Inuit Ataqatigiit party
and allies were swept to power in an election last year, said
that Greenland had great potential but needed to develop.
 ""We need to explore avenues of diversifying our economy,"" he
said, ""and one of the pillars that we will try to build up is
one of minerals and oil, but also tourism and industries based
on clean energy.""
 In the area of clean energy, Kleist said that the focus is
on investment in hydro power, which could in the future attract
heavy industries eager to produce using renewable energy rather
than fossil fuels.
 The country's biggest planned investments are in
hydroelectricity, and once a new plant is running, Greenland
expects to get about 70 percent of its needs from hydro power.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2010 12:04PM ET</span>",France to press G20 to curb currency swings -Sarkozy," PARIS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - France will ask G20 countries to
examine ways to curb excessive exchange rate and commodity price
volatility and pursue the idea of a financial transaction tax
when it holds the presidency of the Group of 20 economic powers
in 2011, President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Wednesday.
 Addressing a diplomats' conference in Paris, Sarkozy said
that he was not seeking a return to fixed exchange rates but
that G20 countries needed to find ways to limit excessive
exchange rate swings and the economic imbalances they create.
 ""Who would challenge the fact that exchange rate instability
poses a major threat to global economic growth?"" asked Sarkozy.
 He said that the current main forum for discussion of
exchange rates was the narrower G7 club but that China must not
be excluded from such discussions.
 ""What we surely need to do is go further and map out a new
framework for consultation on exchange rate developments,"" said
Sarkozy.
 ""But how can we discuss exchange rates nowadays without
China? We need to debate a better way of responding on this
critical matter.
 South Korea currently holds the presidency of the G20, which
spans the world's largest industrialised and rapidly developing
economies, and Seoul will host a summit in late November before
the French take over the reins at the start of 2011.
 Sarkozy said that commodity price volatility, highlighted by
the current surge in wheat prices, was also highly destructive
and that G20 countries should regulate commodity derivatives
just as it is seeking to do so for other financial derivatives.
 ""That way we will limit speculation,"" he said.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2010 11:28AM ET</span>",EU states may block Chinese fibreglass tax-sources," * EU Commission plans 43.6 percent tax on Chinese fibreglass
 * Tax opposed by majority of EU capitals, diplomats say
 * Tax may hurt production of lighter vehicles, wind turbines
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Several European Union member
states will try to pressure the European Commission on Thursday
to scrap plans for a new tax next month on Chinese fibreglass
used in the clean technology sector, EU diplomats told Reuters.
 A special gathering of a secretive EU trade committee --
requested by Germany -- will deliberate whether the Commission
should go ahead with plans for a 43.6 percent tax on Chinese
fibreglass.
 Chinese imports are currently subject to a 7 percent duty.
The Commission's plan would raise this to 50.6 percent to
counteract what it deems as illegal Chinese pricing.
 A majority of EU countries -- including Germany, Britain,
the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden and Finland -- will
oppose this move during Thursday's meeting, diplomats said.
 They are concerned the higher tariff will damage Europe's
clean technology sector, which relies on cheap, strong glass
fibre materials from China for making wind turbine blades and
lightweight cars, ship hulls and trains.
 The Commission has until March 2011 to launch anti-dumping
tariffs but plans to start interim duties by Sept. 16, according
to an internal document seen by Reuters.
 The Commission can go ahead with the tax without support
from all member states, but majority opposition could prompt it
to abandon or modify its plan, as it needs their backing for a
final decision for duties in March.
 
 DUMPING
 European fibreglass producers asked the EU Commission to
introduce protective duties last year, accusing Chinese
exporters of dumping their wares on European markets below cost.
 They say illegal Chinese pricing threatens jobs at producers
such as PPG Industries and Saint-Gobain Vetrotex, whose owner
Owens Corning invented the ultra-strong glass-based strands.
 Opposing countries say the new duty will prompt supply
shortages and hikes in production costs, hurting companies such
as science-based products firm DuPont and wind turbine giant
Vestas, as well as thousands of small firms.
 Europe's fibreglass market had an estimated size of 1
million tonnes or a value of 1 billion euros ($1.26 billion) in
2009, with China supplying about 15 percent.
 Global demand for the strong and light composites has been
growing at twice the rate of global growth as the world
increasingly turns to lightweight vehicles and renewable wind
energy to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions.
 This year, demand for the material is expected to be 25
percent higher than in 2009, according to some industry
estimates, at a time when fibreglass is in short supply, meaning
prices could soar.
 China is set to play an increasingly important role in this
sector, as producers including China Fiberglass already supply
about half the world's fibreglass.
 ""The question Europe needs to ask itself is, do we want to
harm those high-tech industries that make composites that are
still surviving in Europe,"" said Nikolay Mizulin, trade lawyer
for international law firm Hogan Lovells.

 (Adds comments, details. Updates prices)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen pulled back from
15-year highs against the U.S. dollar and a nine-year peak
versus the euro on Wednesday on speculation Japanese
authorities may take action to stem the currency's rise.
 The euro was supported by strong German economic data,
while the dollar remained under pressure after
weaker-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders and housing data
July. For more see [ID:nN25121445] and [ID:nN25127128].
 Traders were reluctant to keep betting on further yen's
gains after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated
he would respond to yen moves when necessary. His comments
followed a Nikkei newspaper report that the finance ministry
may consider unilateral yen-selling intervention.
[ID:nN24264334]
 Analysts said the report and Noda's comments offered a
chance for investors to pause the yen's latest rally, which saw
the dollar post its worst day versus the yen since May on
Tuesday, while the euro broke under a key resistance level. 
 ""The yen has come quite far quite quickly ... so we're
seeing some consolidation,"" said Daragh Maher, currency
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
 He added that news Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
will attend a Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole in the
United States later this week was also making some traders wary
of buying yen. [ID:nTKV006403]
 Some analysts said Shirakawa's travel plans had increased
speculation that Japanese authorities may be preparing to act
on the yen. At the same time, others argue the central bank is
unlikely hold an emergency policy meeting in his absence.
 In late morning trading in New York, the dollar  was
up 0.3 percent on the day to 84.43 yen, within reach of a
15-year low hit on Tuesday at 83.61, according to Reuters data.
 Traders said there was higher demand for short-term
dollar/yen options with a 85.00 yen strike price as
intervention jitters increased.
 But demand for the dollar faltered after reports showed new
orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose far less
than expected in July. Excluding transportation, orders posted
the biggest fall since January 2009.
 Another report showed new U.S. single-family home sales
fell in July to set their slowest pace on record.
 The lackluster data may cap gains in the dollar versus the
yen, analysts said.
 ""Clearly the economy is slowing markedly, and it's a
broad-based slowdown,"" said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency
strategist, at BNY Mellon, in New York.
 ""It'll be difficult for the dollar to rally against the
yen in this environment, though it's worth noting that yen
gains on the crosses -- against the euro, sterling and
elsewhere -- have been even more remarkable."" 
 EURO SEE-SAWS
 The euro  traded 0.3 percent higher at 106.61 yen,
recovering from a nine-year low hit on Tuesday. The single
currency pulled back from the day's high of 107.66 yen.
 Against the dollar, the euro  was slightly higher on
the day at $1.2631, after trading as high as $1.2725.
 Analysts said optimism from the German data was offset by
concerns about fiscally weak euro zone countries, reflected in
a wider yield spread between 10-year Irish and German bonds
 . The yields were at their widest
since May.
 Standard & Poor's on Tuesday downgraded Ireland one notch
to AA- with a negative outlook, fanning worries about euro zone
sovereign debt and the banking system. [ID:nN24275188]. 
 Risk aversion supported the Swiss franc and drove the euro
 to a lifetime low of 1.2973 francs on EBS.

 * World stocks decline for 5th straight day
 * Yen falls back on intervention talk
 By Walden Siew
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for a fifth
straight day on Wednesday as a new batch of disappointing U.S.
economic data fed growing worries of a double-dip recession,
while the yen eased from a 15-year high on speculation that
Japan may intervene to stem the currency's rise.
 Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell in July to their
lowest level in 47 years, and orders of long-lasting
manufacturing goods posted their biggest decline in July in
1-1/2 years, the government reported.
 In Europe, Standard & Poor's cut Ireland's credit rating,
sending a sharp reminder that euro zone economies still face
problems managing their debt.
 Gold rose to an eight-week high and U.S. Treasuries prices
rose as investors turned to traditional safe havens.
 Longer-dated Treasuries drew strong bids, driving the
30-year bond up more than a point at the day's high. The spread
between between two-year and 10-year Treasuries dropped below
200 basis points for the first time since April 2009.
 Slowing economic growth means there will be little
inflationary threat to longer-dated Treasuries, which investors
increasingly see as a good place to store cash as the
deteriorating economy eliminates investment opportunities
elsewhere.
 U.S. stocks fell and European declined to a five-week
closing low after the Commerce Department reported that sales
of U.S. new single-family homes were at the lowest since
records began in 1963. And prices fell to the lowest level in
more than 6-1/2 years, implying further loss of momentum in the
economic recovery. For full story, see [ID:nN25128234]
 The data on new-home sales comes a day after a report that
showed sales of existing homes dropped by a record rate to a
15-year low.
 ""There is a big focus on economic data now that we've come
through the earnings season. People are expecting very slow
growth at the minimum but there is still a potential for a
double dip and investors are looking towards economic data to
help paint the picture for the potential for that,"" said Joshua
Raymond, market strategist at City Index in London.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dipped 44.04
points, or 0.44 percent, to 9,996.41. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> dropped 5.52 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,046.35.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 4.23 points, or 0.20
percent, to 2,119.53.
 A rebound off an S&P 500 index technical support level, on
hand with extended market weakness after five days of broad,
market declines helped buffer losses.
 Energy shares led losses on the S&P 500 as coal miners
stocks dropped on concerns that power plants would switch to
natural gas from coal as the price of gas fell to a three-month
low. For details see [ID:nN25136250].
 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD000000PUS> dropped 0.5 percent, down for a fifth straight
session, and the Thomson Reuters euro zone peripheral index
<.TRXFLDPIPU> lost 0.8 percent.
 In Europe, S&P's one-notch cut in Ireland's rating
overshadowed a better-than-expected German business morale
reading for August from the Ifo think tank.
 ""The Ireland downgrade was not too much of a surprise but
it is still weighing on sentiment,"" said Raymond at City
Index.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed 0.8 percent lower at 1,011.35 points after being
as low as 1,001.83 earlier.
 Miners were among the biggest fallers. BHP Billiton 
fell 2 percent after it said it was cautious on the short-term
outlook and that the economy in China, its biggest customer,
would slow from recent highs.
 Shares of Allied Irish Banks  fell 2.9 percent,
following the S&P ratings downgrade on Ireland. S&P cited high
costs faced by the government to support ailing financial
institutions..
 YEN SELLING
 In currency markets, the yen pulled back from 15-year highs
against the U.S. dollar and a nine-year peak versus the euro on
Wednesday.
 Japan's Nikkei business daily reported that Japan's
Ministry of Finance may intervene on its own to sell yen if
speculators drive up the currency. The dollar has lost nearly 9
percent against the yen this year.
 The strong yen threatens Japan's fragile economic
recovery.
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reinforced that view,
telling reporters that recent yen moves were one-sided and
Tokyo will respond appropriately when necessary.
 ""I think it's unlikely there would be intervention much
above 80 yen,"" said Ray Farris, chief currency strategist at
Credit Suisse in London. ""The yen is not overvalued by our
estimates.""
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 84.56 yen , and up
0.2 percent against a basket of currencies.
 The euro was supported by strong German economic data.
 Tokyo's Nikkei average lost 1.7 percent to hit a 16-month
closing low on disappointment over the lack of policy action by
the authorities to rein in the strong yen.
 In the U.S. Treasuries market, the benchmark 10-year yield
 fell as far as 2.42 percent, the lowest since late
January 2009.
 Later, the market pulled back from its biggest gains as
traders prepared for a $36 billion auction of five-year notes
at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT).
 The 10-year note was last up 9/32 in price, yielding 2.45
percent.
 Also, the poor economic outlook prompted the Federal
Reserve to begin buying Treasuries again recently, underpinning
government bonds with a guaranteed inflow of official cash, at
least as long as the data continues in the weak vein of the
durables report.
 Crude oil prices edged up from a seven-week low but were
still below $72, with copper 0.2 percent lower.
 Gold gained 0.5 percent, and earlier hit an eight-week
high.

 GENEVA, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Growth in world trade slowed in
the second quarter, as a faster expansion in advanced countries
failed to outweigh slowing growth in most emerging economies,
the Dutch CPB economics institute said on Wednesday.
 The figures indicate that the pace of economic recovery is
normalising after a rebound from the recession driven by
emerging economies.
 The CPB institute said in its monthly world trade monitor
that global industrial production had now surpassed the previous
peak reached in March 2008.
 World trade in the second quarter of this year was 3.6
percent higher than in the first quarter, when it grew by 5.7
percent over the previous three months, said the institute,
whose data are used by the European Commission and World Bank.
 Looking at the more volatile monthly figures, the institute
said world trade volumes rose by 0.7 percent in June over May
after a 2.3 percent increase in May.
 The 0.7 percent increase resulted from a rise in imports of
1.7 percent, with imports rising everywhere except in Eastern
Europe, and a 0.3 percent drop in exports, which fell in most
regions in June except for strong increases in the eurozone.

(Adds Fitch comment)
 By Carmel Crimmins
 DUBLIN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Ireland's government faced
mounting pressure on Wednesday to draw a line under its banking
crisis after a credit rating cut from Standard & Poor's pushed
its borrowing costs higher.
 After winning plaudits for moving quickly to tackle its
deficit, Ireland is once again at the centre of European debt
fears with investors demanding a whopping 346 basis point
premium to hold Irish 10-year debt over German Bunds, the
highest level since the Greek financial crisis gripped in May.
 S&P cut Ireland's long-term rating by one notch to 'AA-' on
fears of a substantially higher bill for supporting the banking
sector and assigned a negative outlook, meaning another cut is
likely over the next one or two years.
 Markets want Ireland to put a final price on purging its
banks of a decade-long property binge but the head of Ireland's
debt management agency said that was impossible before the
year-end when the state-run ""bad bank"" will have largely
completed its purchase of their commercial property loans.
 ""It's a bit like waking up the patient in the middle of an
operation to tell him he's not feeling well,"" John Corrigan, the
chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency
(NTMA) told Reuters Insider television.
 ""We know the situation is pretty painful but we have to get
to the end of the operation which will be in December.""
 S&P hiked its estimate of the cost to the government of
recapitalising the banks at 45-50 billion euros ($63 billion), a
figure dismissed by the debt agency in highly unusual criticism.
 Corrigan described S&P's analysis as ""flawed"".
 But the downgrade, and the possibility of more to come,
weighed on European shares and Irish financial stocks.
 Fellow euro-zone peripheral Portugal managed to raise 1.3
billion euros in bonds on Wednesday but demand was below
Ireland's auction last week and the cost of protecting Irish and
Portuguese debt against default rose.
 Ireland will likely have to shell out a higher price in a
treasury bill auction on Thursday and S&P's cut raises the
stakes for Bank of Ireland next month when it is expected to tap
the public debt markets in a crucial test for the sector and
wider economy.
 
 FISCAL PROGRESS OVERSHADOWED
 Rating agencies have been steadily hacking away at Ireland's
credit rating and S&P's is now on a par with Fitch and one notch
below Moody's, which cut its rating to Aa2 last month. Unlike
S&P, both Fitch and Moody's have stable outlooks.
 Fitch said on Wednesday its 'AA-' rating remained ""robust
enough"" to cope with Ireland's problems, including Anglo Irish.
 ""I still think now that the two notch cut to AA- was
sufficient to justify a stable outlook,"" said Fitch Ratings'
senior analyst Chris Pryce.
 Prime Minister Brian Cowen has been lauded for tackling the
worst state deficit in Europe but a steadily rising bill for
bailing out nationalised lender Anglo Irish Bank -- from 4.5
billion euros last year to an estimated 22-25 billion at present
-- threatens to eclipse his fiscal achievements.
 The extra top-ups for Anglo Irish Bank and two building
societies will likely push the country's budget deficit over 20
percent of GDP this year from 14 percent in 2009.
 Officials have been at pains to point out Ireland is not
facing a Greek-style fiscal meltdown and the blow-out in the
budget is a one-off in EU accounting terms while the actual cost
of bailing out Anglo is spread out over up to 15 years.
 But market fears mean that Cowen will be under even more
pressure to shrink the underlying budget in the face of an
already stretched and unhappy electorate and tensions within his
own party and the wider coalition.
 Despite his razor thin majority, Cowen is broadly expected
to push through his fourth austerity budget this December
because neither his party nor the minority Greens want to face
the wrath of voters at an early parliamentary election.
 ""Their majority is precarious but I don't see them
voluntarily offering themselves up,"" said Neil Collins, a
professor of politics at University College Cork.
 Much of the certainty that investors are seeking is out of
Cowen's control. 
 They may get some answers next month.
 A European Commission decision on Anglo's restructuring
plan, some details of Allied Irish Bank's capital-raising asset
sales, the Irish banks' refinancing of around 25 billion euros
in redemptions and a possible Bank of Ireland public bond are
all expected in September.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
not budge on interest rates until late next year at the earliest
and while leaving its inflation projections unchanged, its 2010
growth forecasts will be ramped up, a Reuters poll showed.
 None of the 78 economists polled this week said the ECB
would change interest rates from a record low of 1.0 percent
when it meets on Sept. 2 and medians suggest the first move up
to 1.25 percent won't be until the last months of 2011.
 That is later than the consensus for a rise in the third
quarter of next year seen in a Reuters poll taken just two weeks
ago. Worries about a global slowdown continue to weigh on
policymakers' minds despite strength in Germany.
 ""The multiple headwinds to growth and the prospect of very
low core inflation for some time to come suggest that the
refinancing rate will be staying at 1 percent for a considerable
period of time,"" said Ken Wattret at BNP Paribas.
 While data released earlier this month showed the 16-nation
euro zone's economy grew 1.0 percent in the second quarter --
its fastest pace in more than three years and outpacing growth
in the United States -- growth is seen slowing to 0.3 percent in
coming quarters.
 Worryingly for policymakers, some indicators show there is a
growing divergence in pace of recovery in the bloc with growth
in Germany and France far outstripping lacklustre numbers from
Spain and Italy.
 ""The contrast of very strong growth in northern Europe and
the disaster of southern Europe will cause the ECB a very real
problem in 2011,"" said Azad Zangana at Schroders.
 ""Tightening policy before southern Europe is ready could
risk a break-up of the union, while tightening too late for
northern Europe could lead to inflation pressures mounting in
Germany and France.""
 
 PROJECTED PROJECTIONS
 The majority of economists said the central bank would leave
its staff projections for inflation this year and next unchanged
at between 1.4 and 1.6 percent and 1.0 to 2.2 percent
respectively.
 While economists were convinced that the ECB would raise its
2010 growth forecast range of 0.7 to 1.3 percent -- with 45 of
46 saying they would -- they were more divided over what the
bank would project for 2011.
 Twenty said the bank would revise up its 0.2 to 2.2 percent
2011 forecasts while 22 said they would be left unchanged. Four
said the forecasts would be revised down.
 A Reuters poll taken earlier this month predicted growth of
1.2 percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2011.
 
 LONG-TERM LENDING
 The ECB is having some success in its efforts to wean banks
off cheap money. Stronger lenders are reducing their dependence
on central bank funding, but those from peripheral economies
still need support.
 Most economists polled said the central bank would end its
policy of offering unlimited funds to banks in longer-term
auctions in another 3-6 months.
 For weekly operations, economists were more divided, with
three saying they would not be extended, 10 saying they would be
extended for three months, 19 for six months and 17 saying they
would be extended for more than six months.
 ""With the experience that it usually takes some time before
the 'super-tanker' ECB changes its course, we should expect the
current policy to be continued for a while,"" said Gernot
Griebling at LBBW.
 The ECB started providing banks with unlimited funds at a
fixed rate in September 2008 in an effort to calm markets. As
the panic has subsided, the central bank has been slowly turning
off the tap.
 The bank lent 19.08 billion euros in three-month funds on
Wednesday, almost in line with a Reuters poll. Outstanding ECB
lending has fallen more than a third since the start of July.
 The central bank has said that unlimited liquidity will be
on offer in the shorter-term one-week and one-month operations
until at least mid-October and until the end of September for
three-month money.
 Last week Bundesbank chief Axel Weber said he was ""very
strongly"" of the view that three-month unlimited money should be
extended at least into next year.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen pulled back from
15-year highs against the dollar and a nine-year peak versus
the euro on Wednesday on speculation Japanese authorities may
take action to stem the currency's rise.
 The euro see-sawed after strong German economic data, while
the dollar pared some of its earlier gains versus both single
currency and the yen after a weaker-than-expected reading on
U.S. durable goods orders for July. For more see.
 Traders were reluctant to keep betting on further yen's
gains after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated
he would respond to yen moves when necessary. His comments
followed a Nikkei newspaper report that the finance ministry
may consider unilateral yen-selling intervention.
 Analysts said the report and Noda's comments offered a
chance for investors to pause the yen's latest rally, which saw
the dollar post its worst day versus the yen since May on
Tuesday, while the euro broke under a key resistance level.
 ""The yen has come quite far quite quickly ... so we're
seeing some consolidation,"" said Daragh Maher, currency
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
 He added that news Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
will attend a Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole in the
United States later this week was also making some traders wary
of extending the yen's rally for the moment. Some
analysts said Shirakawa's travel plans had increased
speculation that Japanese authorities may be preparing to act
on the yen. At the same time, others argue the central bank is
unlikely hold an emergency policy meeting in his absence.
 In morning trading in New York, the dollar was up 0.3
percent on the day to 84.35 yen, within reach of a 15-year low
hit on Tuesday around 83.60.
 Traders said there was higher demand for short-term
dollar/yen options with a 85.00 yen strike price as
intervention jitters increased, adding this was supporting the
U.S. currency.
 But demand for the dollar faltered after a report showed
new orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose far
less than expected in July. Excluding transportation, orders
posted the biggest fall since January 2009.
 ""It adds to the slew of softer-than-expected data coming
out of the U.S.,"" said Matthew Strauss, a senior currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in Toronto.
 ""Clearly the risk of entering into a period of very, very
sluggish growth has risen,"" he added. 
 EURO UNDER PRESSURE
 The euro traded 0.2 percent higher at 106.55 yen,
recovering from a nine-year low hit on Tuesday. The single
currency pulled back from the day's high of 107.66 yen.
 Analysts said the euro had bumped lower on concerns about
fiscally weak euro zone countries, reflected in a wider yield
spread between 10-year Irish and German bonds, which expanded
to its widest since May. Standard & Poor's on Tuesday
downgraded Ireland one notch to AA- with a negative outlook,
fanning worries about euro zone sovereign debt and the banking
system..
 Against the dollar, the euro was slightly higher on the day
at $1.2641.

 * In talks to renegotiate long-term gas supply deals
 
 (Adds quotes, details)
 By Wojciech Moskwa
 STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Germany's leading gas
buyer E.ON Ruhrgas said it expected European gas markets to stay
oversupplied in the medium to long term and it was in talks to
renegotiate long-term contracts with suppliers.
 ""We said the medium to long term, which means not something
that we are likely to see in three to five years,"" Chief
Executive Klaus Schafer said on being asked when Europe's gas
glut would end.
 ""It depends very much on the pick-up of some of the
economies of Europe and depends on the question of conversion of
some power plants from other fossil fuels to gas,"" Schafer told
reporters at a oil and gas conference in Norway on Wednesday.
 ""It will not last forever but for quite a while.""
 E.ON's wholesale gas unit, one of Europe's biggest gas
buyers from Russia, said that it was in talks with suppliers to
change long-term gas supply contracts.
 These contracts do not reflect the recent decoupling of spot
prices from those in long-term deals and need to be more
flexible to take into account changing economic conditions in
Europe, it said.
 ""We believe that the long-term contracts need to be
re-engineered for future decades, not just renegotiated as in
the past but put on new terms that mostly reflect price levels,
flexibility and indexation of price formats,"" Schafer said.
 E.ON said talks were continuing, but results were scant so
far. ""We have already achieved something but still have a way to
go,"" said Hans-Peter Floren, a member of the E.ON Ruhrgas
management board.
 Schafer said gas consumption in Europe tumbled by 7 percent
last year and by 5 percent in Germany. Also, shale gas
discoveries have made the United States more self-reliant and
have diverted more LNG (liquefied natural gas) supplies to
Europe -- all helping to push down spot prices.
 ""Experts expect the share of LNG in EU30 (30 European
countries') gas supplies to rise from about 10 percent now to
24-25 percent in 2020,"" Schafer said.

 By Natalya Zinets and Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Wednesday it had
put off introducing curbs on grain exports because the world
market had settled after Russia's export ban and the Ukrainian
home market was no longer threatened by demand from abroad.
 But Ukrainian customs continued to enforce de facto export
restrictions by blocking grain shipments from sea ports on the
grounds that cargoes had been wrongly labelled. 
 ""Everything is frozen. There are no grain shipments to ports
because of the restrictions imposed by regional authorities.
There is no movement going on in the ports,"" one trader said.
 On the grains markets world number one wheat buyer Egypt and
major Russian grain customer hammered home the impact of
Russia's lost exports, buying 240,000 tonnes of French and
Canadian wheat.
 Purchases of wheat by Egypt's General Authority for Supply
Commodities (GASC) since Russia's Aug.15 ban on exports show
Egypt has taken 720,000 tonnes from France, 55,000 tonnes from
the United States and 120,000 tonnes from Canada.
 One of the world's top wheat and barley exporters, Ukraine
earlier this month proposed limiting exports of the two
commodities to 2.5 million tonnes between September and December
following a drought in the region.
 The move followed a ban on grain exports by last year's
world number three grains exporter Russia, which led to soaring
grain prices and panic buying on world markets.
 ""The question (of quotas) will not be discussed today,"" Farm
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said on Wednesday. Asked by
journalists whether the government would introduce quotas for
the 2010/11 season as earlier proposed, he said: ""Not yet"".
 
 DRAWDOWN FEAR
 The Russian ban raised fears in Ukraine that foreign hunger
for grain would draw down Ukrainian stocks and lead to a bread
shortage in the country of 46 million where the economy is just
beginning to recover from the global downturn.
 Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Slauta said the ex-Soviet
republic, which consumes 26 million tonnes of grain per year and
plans to harvest up to 41 million tonnes of grain in 2010, had
enough grain to avoid imposing curbs on exports.
 Black Sea neighbour Kazakhstan said on Wednesday it planned
to buy more than 2 million tonnes of grain from local farmers
this year to guard against inflation after a spike in world
prices after Russia's worst heatwave on record.
 A Kazakh official said Russia and Azerbaijan would pick up a
large share of Kazakhstan's wheat exports in the current season,
while deliveries to Iran -- the largest buyer of Kazakh wheat
last season -- were expected to decline.
 The country is also preserving traditional markets in
Central Asia and Afghanistan, which it ministry expects to
account for half of the 8 million tonnes shipped this season.

 RUSSIA VACUUM FILLED
 European and U.S. grain suppliers had now filled the gap on
the world market caused by the Russian export ban and sky-high
prices had come down, Slauta said.
 ""The United States and France have become players on the
Black Sea market and even Germany has become an exporter. They
covered the gap. Speculative prices have come down and are now
close to market prices,"" he told reporters.
He said wheat prices in Europe had fallen to $260 per tonne
from $350-$360 in mid-July.
 ""This whirlpool has hit not only countries which will have
no harvest...but also Ukraine, which will harvest 40-41 million
tonnes of grain,"" Slauta said.
But he said a decrease in harvest would mean a smaller grain
export in the 2010/11 season.
 Ukraine sold 21.5 million tonnes of various grains in
2009/10 season from a total harvest of 46 million tonnes.
Traders and analysts say exports could be down to 15 million
tonnes in 2010/11.
 The Agriculture Ministry in Russia said its grain crop had
fallen by nearly a third so far, delaying winter grain sowing.
 Meanwhile Germany's 2010 grain crop could fall to around
43.9 million tonnes from 49.7 million tonnes in 2009, the German
farmers' association DBV said on Wednesday, adding to a downbeat
outlook for the EU's second biggest producer.
 
 CUSTOMS BOTTLENECK
 Ukrainian customs officials, however, continued to find
reasons to block grain shipments all the same.
Grain movements out of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and
Azov Sea have been halted by customs officials saying, for
instance, that milling wheat was being illegally exported under
the guise of fodder.
 ""The government does not need quotas because customs have
already limited all exports,"" the foreign trader told Reuters.
 Traders said curbs had already cut Ukrainian grain exports
and the country could sell about 1.2-1.5 million tonnes of grain
in the two first months of the 2010/11 season compared to about
4.0 million in July-August 2009/10.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen pulled back from 15-year
highs against the dollar and a nine-year peak versus the euro on
Wednesday on speculation Japanese authorities may take action to
stem the currency's rise.
 The euro erased gains made on strong German economic data as
a widening in peripheral euro zone bond yield spreads
highlighted concerns about weak countries in the bloc, following
a downgrade of Ireland's credit rating the previous day.
 Investors were cautious about extending the yen's gains
after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated he would
respond to yen moves when necessary. His comments followed a
Nikkei newspaper report that the finance ministry may consider
unilateral yen-selling intervention.
 Analysts said the report and Noda's comments offered a

 At 1120 GMT, the dollar was up around 0.5 percent on the day
to 84.55 yen, within reach of a 15-year low hit on Tuesday
around 83.60. The all-time low for dollar/yen is around 79.75
yen, hit in April 1995.
 Traders said there was higher demand for short-term
dollar/yen options with a 85.00 yen strike price as intervention
jitters increased, adding this was supporting the U.S. currency.
 
 EURO RELIQUISHES GAINS
 The euro traded 0.6 percent higher at 106.89 yen, recovering
from a nine-year low of 105.44 hit on trading platform EBS on
Tuesday. The single currency pulled back from the day's high of
107.64 yen.
 Analysts said the euro had bumped lower on concerns about
fiscally weak euro zone countries, reflected in a wider yield

sovereign debt and the banking system..
 The euro was flat on the day at $1.2626.
 The widening spreads pushed the euro off the day's high
around $1.2725 hit after the German Ifo survey came in above
forecasts. Traders said Middle East and Swiss selling demand
also capped the rally.
 Risk aversion supported the Swiss franc and drove the
euro to a lifetime low of 1.2973 francs on EBS.
 Traders were closely watching Tokyo's Nikkei share index,
which fell more than 2 percent to a 16-month low, calculating
that the steeper its losses the more likely Japanese authorities
might finally bite the bullet and intervene.
 Still, some saw intervention as unlikely at current levels.
 ""It's unlikely there would be intervention much above 80
yen,"" said Ray Farris, chief currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in London. ""Price action is not disorderly and the yen is
not overvalued by our estimates.""

 * Sees lower than expected budget deficits

(Adds quotes, background)
 TALLINN, Aug 25 (Reuters) - A growth pick-up in Estonia will
be slightly less forceful than expected after the Baltic state
enters the euro zone next year while inflation will stay well
above 2 percent, the Finance Ministry forecast on Wednesday.
 Estonia, whose economy shrank 14 percent in 2009, the third-
largest drop in the European Union, will become the 17th member
of the euro zone from Jan 1, 2011.
 It reached its euro goal after pursuing conservative fiscal
policies and after its economic slump caused deflation last
year.
 ""Estonia's economic growth tempo will speed up in the second
quarter of the 2010, with growth carried by the export sector
and at the same time the start of a recovery in domestic
demand,"" the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
The ministry raised its 2010 growth forecast to 2 percent
from 1 percent, but slightly cut the 2011 outlook to 3.6 percent
from 4.0 percent.
 The ministry also raised its 2010 average annual inflation
forecast to 2.6 percent from 1.1 percent.
 It saw the rate of consumer price rises at 2.5 percent in
2011, higher than the previously expected 2.0 percent.
 The ministry was more upbeat about the budget deficit,
seeing it this year at 1.3 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) rather than the 2.5 percent previously forecast.
 In 2011, the funding gap would be 1.6 percent of GDP, less
than the 2.2 percent expected before. The goal was a balanced
budget by 2014, the ministry added.
 Estonia's euro entry and signs of stabilisation in fellow
Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania have helped lift the cloud of
gloom which settled over the region during 2009, when their
economies fell the most in the European Union.
 The picture has also improved for Nordic banks, which became
major players in the Baltic states during the boom years.

 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Hungary's government on
Wednesday ruled out signing a new financing deal with the
International Monetary Fund, triggering renewed forint weakness
and uncertainty about the country's fiscal outlook.
 Officials had excited markets with comments late on Tuesday
promising to renew talks with the Fund this autumn, the latest
in a series of mixed messages to come from Budapest on its
finances since a new government took power in May. 
 The Economy Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that
Hungary does not need a new financing deal with the IMF and the
talks with the Fund would be only about a regular country review
during consultations which the Fund conducts with all states.
 Even though Hungary has not drawn on any fresh funds from
its existing IMF/EU loan since last year, securing a new safety
net type deal had been seen by many market players as a
guarantee of fiscal probity from the new administration.
 ""The Hungarian State has not drawn upon fresh funds from the
existing IMF/EU/World Bank loan since July 2009. It is able to
finance itself from the market and the country reckons with
relying on market financing in the upcoming period as well,"" the
ministry said.
 ""Based on this, there has not been and will not be need for
a new loan agreement in the future either, therefore the talks
planned for the autumn are not aimed at signing a new loan
agreement,"" it added.
 Markets have refrained from punishing the centre-right
Fidesz government ahead of October local elections, hoping it
would reverse its opposition to more IMF aid. Talks with lenders
about a review of Hungary's current deal, which runs out in
October, unexpectedly collapsed in July.
 The forint dropped 0.6 percent to 284.30 versus the euro
after the ministry's statement ruling out a new deal, while
government bond yields rose about 10 basis points.
 ""Why the government needs to make it so clear at this stage
why they are not going to seek to renew the agreement with the
IMF is beyond me,"" RBS analyst Timothy Ash said in a note to
clients.
 ""They seem determined to prove that they can go it alone, a
strategy which could still end in tears."" 
 
 LEEWAY
 A Ministry press official had said on Tuesday that Budapest
would resume talks with the IMF in the autumn and ""the sides
will reach an agreement"".
 The aid from the Fund and the European Union was vital in
staving off a full-blown currency and debt crisis after the
collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers deepened global
financial turmoil in 2008.
 But the ruling Fidesz party is seeking more leeway on policy
than the deal with the Fund allows. It has pledged to meet an
IMF deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP this year, but has
signalled it did not intend to bring the deficit below 3 percent
next year even though Hungary is obliged to do so under the EU's
Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban said last month that Hungary's
economy must be financed from the market as it wanted to regain
economic sovereignty, and the government has already secured the
bulk of the funding it needs for this year.
 Lajos Kosa, vice chairman of Fidesz, said earlier on
Wednesday that Hungary would negotiate with the EU about an
economic and fiscal track which would be acceptable for Hungary.
 ""It seems that yesterday's comment from the Economic
Ministry... does not mean that talks about a 2nd programme will
resume. It is not very clear what they want,"" said Gyorgy Barcza
at K&H Bank.
 Fidesz faces municipal elections on Oct. 3, and most
analysts have said it was unlikely to lay out its 2011 budget
plans ahead of the vote fearing it might lose some of its still
strong public support.
 Raiffeisen analyst Adam Keszeg believes a new deal may still
be signed after the October vote.
 ""We think it is more likely that there will be a new
financing deal than not, but there is great uncertainty around
it,"" he said, adding a deal would be good for Hungary as its
funding costs would be lower.
 Separately, the central bank warned on Wednesday that the
budget deficit would overshoot the 3.8 percent of GDP target
this year without further fiscal measures.

 * Prefers medium-sized investors

(Adds details, background)
 By Nelson Banya
 HARARE, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe has invited new takeover
bids for state steel-maker ZISCO, a minister said on Wednesday,
following rejection of offers from ArcelorMittal South Africa
and India's Jindal Steel and Power.
 A power-sharing government formed by bitter rivals President
Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has sought to
attract foreign investors in a bid to raise at least $10 billion
to fix the economy.
 The government has identified cash-starved ZISCO, once a
major foreign currency earner with the capacity to produce 1
million tonnes of steel per year, as the first state-owned
enterprise to be disposed of in a bid to revive its operations.
 ""The ministry wishes to advise interested parties that bids
for a strategic partner for ZISCO are now open,"" Industry and
Commerce Minister Welshman Ncube said in a statement.
 ""Completed offers must reach the ministry on 24 September
2010.""
 Ncube was not immediately available to comment on whether
firms that had previously bid for ZISCO would be allowed to do
so again in a bidding process expected to take place over three
months.
 In May, Ncube announced that Mugabe had thrown out bids by
the ArcelorMittal unit and by Jindal Steel, which had been
shortlisted for the ZISCO stake, saying they were too big and
that Zimbabwe preferred medium-sized investors for the company.

 ZISCO operations have been grounded since the height of
Zimbabwe's economic meltdown in 2008, and analysts say it would
need a big investor to help offset its $300 million debt.
 Analysts say Zimbabwe has struggled to attract significant
investment, even though the unity government has brought
economic stability, because of ongoing wrangles within the
coalition and an empowerment law that aims to localise control
of all foreign firms.
 The government has, however, said ZISCO's privatisation
would not be affected by the controversial law, which compels
foreign investors to sell 51 percent stakes to local blacks.

 * Cheap Russian grain likely to reconquer lost markets
 
 By Aleksandras Budrys
 MOSCOW, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Last year's world top three grain
exporter Russia has seen its ambitious export plans thwarted by
catastrophic drought but will regain its footing in traditional
markets, analysts say, even as rivals exploit its export ban.
 Its main spearhead in satisfying traditional markets in
North Africa and the Middle East and carving out new markets in
Asia will be price competitiveness.
 Russia, which has not imported grain in large quantities for
about a decade, is estimated by some to need grain imports of up
to 5 million tonnes this year, a body blow to a nation keen on
becoming a dominant exporter.
 ""First of all, we must restore an exportable surplus, which
does not appear to be easy under current circumstances,"" Dmitry
Rylko, director of the Institute for Agricultural Market studies
analytical centre, said.
 ""When we restore the surplus, which will definitely take
place sooner or later. We will gradually re-establish our
relations with all the key buyers.""
 Rylko said that if Russia offered competitive prices, which
it has done in previous years, the customers would come back.
 Egypt, the world's biggest wheat importer, and a key
purchaser of Russian grain, has been disappointed by Russia's
export ban which runs from mid-August to the end of the year and
is intended to conserve stocks and head off inflation.
 Egypt said on Aug 17 it had bought 360,000 tonnes of wheat
from Russia's exporting arch-enemy France, since the export ban
began, and neighbouring buyers are increasingly turning to other
rivals including Germany, Canada and the United States. 
 Jordan, for example, has bought 200,000 tonnes of German
wheat this month, while Lebanon bought 50,000 tonnes of wheat
from the United States and optional U.S., Canadian or German
origin, citing disruption from the Russian export ban.
 ""A temporary suspension of Russian exports does not mean a
complete loss of those markets,"" Andrei Sizov Sr., CEO of
SovEcon agricultural analysts, said.
 ""The Russian grain will be in demand on those markets as it
is cheap and competitive and its quality is rather good.""
 International grain futures prices hit two year highs early
in August, doubling from June lows as the extent of Russia's
drought unfolded.
 
 LEAN YEAR
 Russia's worst drought in a century is estimated to have cut
the country's grain crop by a quarter, a big setback after
bumper harvests in 2008 and 2009.
 ""The bad 2010 crop will definitely pour some cold water on
the ambitious grain export plans of Russian politicians,""
SovEcon's Sizov said.
 ""It is very likely that politically motivated but
economically infeasible declarations on the need to create an
""eastern corridor"" to the markets of Japan, China and the like
will be forgotten until the next abundant crop.""
 The abundant bumper 2008 crop of 108 million tonnes prompted
Russia to announce an ambitious plan to raise production by 50
percent in the next 15 years and to double grain exports to
40-50 million tonnes.
 The major driving force behind the plan was the state grain
trader, United Grain Company, which aimed to become Russia's top
exporter by shipping 16 million tonnes of grain by 2015 from an
exportable surplus forecast to reach 40 million tonnes.
 UGC and its strategic partner, the Russian grain transport
company, estimated infrastructure development by 2015 would
require around $3.3 billion.
 To build new grain terminals and to upgrade the existing
ones alone, some $800 million will be needed, they estimated.
 Moscow has also announced plans to increase exports to South
East Asia and to win new markets such as China and Japan.
 Asia should become a key market for Russian grain, lobby
group the Russian Grain Union has said. It had expected grain
shipments to Asia to triple or quadruple to between 1.5 million
and 2.0 million tonnes by 2012, from an estimated 500,000 tonnes
in 2009.

 TIMING TRICKY
 Russia's market comeback, while seen probable, will be
difficult to to predict, however, even as rains push into some
parched areas making winter wheat planting for harvesting in
2011 a little easier.
 First deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov has said the
drought may cut the area to be sown with winter grains for the
2011 crop by one third to 12 million hectares, so farmers will
have to sow an extra 6 million hectares with spring grains. 
 Sizov said investments in agriculture in the last two years
have been declining and therefore a production level of 100
million tonnes a year, let alone the targeted 150 million
tonnes, is unlikely anytime soon.
 ""Currently we can only say that if Russia harvests 75-80
million tonnes, this will be a big achievement,"" he said.
 Russia's total grain crop this year is officially expected
to reach 60-65 million tonnes, although some see it struggling
to get above 60 million this year, way down from last year's 97
million tonne crop.
 Exports, if they restart next year, would be relatively low,
up to 10 million tonnes. The carryover stocks will fall
drastically and will not support intensive exports as in the
previous two years and in July this year.
 Sizov said that although Russia may put some infrastructure
plans on hold it will be still developing infrastructure in the
south of the country -- the gateway to ""large and stable markets
like Egypt, Turkey, Syria.""

 * Market wary of possible Japan action on yen
 * But current price may restrict action

(Adds detail, updates prices)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen pulled back from 15-year
highs against the dollar and a nine-year peak versus the euro on
Wednesday on speculation Japanese authorities may take active
steps to stem the currency's rise.
 The euro was also boosted after German Ifo business
sentiment unexpectedly rose to a three-year high in August.
 Caution on the yen initially stemmed from a Nikkei business
daily report saying Japan's Ministry of Finance may consider
unilateral yen-selling intervention if speculators drive up the
currency. [ID:nN24264334]
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reinforced that view,
telling reporters on Wednesday that recent yen moves were
one-sided and that Tokyo would respond appropriately when
necessary. [ID:nTKU106216]
 But some in the market said intervention was unlikely at
current levels.
 ""It's unlikely there would be intervention much above 80
yen,"" said Ray Farris, chief currency strategist at Credit
Suisse in London.
 ""Price action is not disorderly and the yen is not
overvalued by our estimates.""
 At 0925 GMT, the dollar was trading with gains of around 0.6
percent versus the yen  at 84.60 yen, still within reach
of a 15-year low hit on Tuesday of 83.60. Traders reported
demand for short-term 85.00 yen option strikes as intervention
jitters increased.
 The all-time low for dollar/yen, hit in April 1995, is
around 79.75 yen.
 The yen also slipped against the euro , which
triggered stop-losses back above 107.00 yen to trade with gains
of around 1.3 percent at 107.40 yen after falling to a nine-year
low at 105.44 on trading platform EBS on Tuesday.

 U.S. DEFLATION FEARS
 Traders were also closely watching the Nikkei average of
Tokyo stocks <.N225>, which fell more than 2 percent to a
16-month low, calculating that the steeper its losses the more
likely Japanese authorities might finally bite the bullet and
intervene.
 Analysts were sceptical about just how effective any
intervention by Japan alone would be.
 ""We would expect hedge funds to sell into any intervention,
given that the USD/JPY move is driven by U.S. deflation fears,""
currency analysts at ING said in a note to clients.
 Dismal housing data on Tuesday escalated concerns about the
U.S. economy, prompting a further bout of risk reduction as
stocks traded with heavy losses, increasing demand for safe
havens such as the yen and the Swiss franc. [ID:nN24249810]
 The Swissie rallied to an all-time high versus the euro
 of 1.2988 francs.
 ""Risk aversion is up, yields are lower and I think
euro/Swiss can continue to come lower. Switzerland's large
surplus makes it a safe haven,"" said Farris at Credit Suisse.
 The euro rose versus the dollar  to a session high of
$1.2722 after the German Ifo [ID:nBEB004473] survey came in
above forecasts. Traders said Middle-East and Swiss supply
capped the rally.
 Earlier, the currency took a hit after Standard & Poor's
downgraded Ireland one notch to AA- and warned the outlook was
still negative, fanning worries about euro zone sovereign debt
and the banking system. [ID:nN24275188].

 * Minsk seeks to strengthen relations with China
 * Further market reforms to attract investors still possible

 By Andrei Makhovsky and Lidia Kelly
 MINSK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Belarus is likely to give few
clues at least until after upcoming presidential elections on
whether it will seek much-needed foreign investment elsewhere or
concentrate on its strongly developing links with China.
 The former Soviet state of Belarus, struggling to reduce its
dependence on Russia and unwilling to bring in the sweeping
reforms demanded by Western investors, saw its economy grow by a
mere 0.2 percent in 2009, down from 10.0 percent a year earlier,
according to IMF figures.
 Analysts say Belarus needs new export markets and foreign
investment to support growth.
 ""There is no escape ... Belarus has only one path -- to
create a competitive economy, which is not possible without
fundamental changes,"" said Sergei Levin, an economist with
Renaissance Capital in Minsk.
 President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since
1994, is under pressure to loosen economic controls and seek a
wider range of foreign investors after Russia this year hiked
energy prices and withdrew $2 billion worth of effective
subsidies on oil supplied to Belarus refineries. But few
expect Lukashenko, running for a fourth term in presidential
elections due within six months, to loosen economic control
before the vote -- and the president has told visiting EU
officials not to expect major changes even afterwards.
 ""We will not crawl on our knees before you, before Russia or
before America,"" he said last month.
 Criticised by Washington and Brussels for his intolerance of
dissent -- a subject Beijing asks fewer questions about as on
economic reform -- Lukashenko has yet to significantly improve
diplomatic ties with the West. 
 In the spring, however, Lukashenko signed a series of
projects with China potentially worth $10 billion -- more than
one-fifth of Belarus's gross domestic product (GDP) last year --
and covering areas including car manufacture, electricity and
sugar refining.
 Last year, China was Belarus's fourth biggest trading
partner after Russia, the European Union and Ukraine, with trade
turnover at 1 billion euros, three-quarters of it being imports
from China.
 It is unclear though whether Lukashenko thinks growing links
with Beijing, without the moves away from a centrally planned
economy desired by Western investors, are enough for one of
Europe's poorest countries. The IMF in April cut its 2010 growth
forecast to 2.4 percent from an earlier 3.8 percent.
 ""Lukashenko understands that if liberalisation begins, it
will mean no return,"" said Alexander Feduta, a political analyst
in Minsk. 
 
 LACK OF CASH
 One thing that may push Lukashenko towards more
liberalisation and privatisation is simply Minsk's lack of cash.
 The country is facing a budget deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP
this and next year at least and the IMF sees its foreign debt
reaching a record high of 52 percent of GDP in 2010.
 To finance the deficit and the debt, Belarus may after the
election start long-promised privatisation of big firms such as
potash producer Belaruskali.
 Three years after Lukashenko first promised to liberalise
the economy, the International Monetary Fund remains hopeful of
change, the Fund's Minsk representative Natalia Kolyazina said.
 ""Liberalisation has not been abandoned,"" she told Reuters,
citing her talks with government officials. The IMF has praised
the greater price and currency flexibility allowed in return for
a $3.5 billion loan in 2008.
 In a sign Western investors want exposure to Belarus, they
snapped up its first dollar bond issue in July, letting it place
a five-year $600 million Eurobond. Minsk has since added $400
million to the issue, thus doubling the original expectations.
 Foreign direct investment, still led by Russia, was down 15
percent last year at just $1.8 billion, according to data from
the central bank and the United Nations trade body UNCTAD.
 The country aims to boost annual FDI inflows to $7 billion,
Prime Minister Sergei Sidorsky said recently, but this looks
tough, partly because of the global crisis but also because
foreigners want more clear-cut rules of the game.
 Investors see in Lukashenko what is termed a ""single person
risk"", said Michael Kart, managing partner at Marshall Spectrum,
a Moscow-based private equity firm.
 ""All very much depends on his moods, on his good intentions,
on his will. It's very hard to predict whether these changes
will take place.""

(Adds quotes, details)
 By John Bowker and Kiryl Sukhotski
 MOSCOW, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Wednesday
it could still exceed its global sales target despite worries
about U.S. economic recovery but the appreciating yen could have
a big negative impact on its financial results.
 ""Yen appreciation will have a big impact on us. We have to
take countermeasures to minimise the impact,"" Chief Operating
Officer Toshiyuki Shiga told Reuters Insider television.
 He said countermeasures included increased imports of car
parts.
 ""We are not yet changing profit forecasts but there is a
head wind -- raw material costs are rising, the yen is
appreciating ... We budgeted for 90 yen to the dollar, it is now
83,"" he said.
 In July, Nissan reported its strongest quarterly operating
profit in more than two years as sales surged in China and other
major markets, but it left its cautious guidance unchanged amid
an increasingly murky outlook for demand.
 Japan's No.3 automaker is aiming to boost its global market
share this year with sales growth of about 8 percent to 3.8
million units, driven by a revamped Micra/March subcompact, Juke
crossover and other new models including the much-hyped Leaf
electric car. 
 ""On current trends we can exceed our global sales target
(3.8 million units) as the market is still stable, but the U.S.
recovery is not expected to go very well,"" Shiga said.
 Separately, the head of Nissan Russia unit, Francois Goupil
de Bouille, said Nissan's sales in Russia would double to
100,000 units this year while overall Russian car sales could
reach up to 2 million units after a slump in 2009.

Corp said on Wednesday the yen's current level does not hugely
affect its earnings or long-term business strategy because it has

 ""Foreign exchange rates at current levels do not do much harm
to our earnings,"" President Shoshi Arakawa told a news
conference.
 ""I think it is not necessary to review our sales or
production strategy for the long term if the dollar stays around
85 yen,"" he said, adding that a stronger yen at such levels as 83
yen to the dollar would not prompt the company to review its
strategy either.
 ""The recent strength of the yen has not prompted us to
consider accelerating the shift of our Japanese operations or
moving our headquarters abroad,"" he added.
 The yen strengthened to a 15-year high against the dollar and
a nine-year peak against the euro on Tuesday, threatening the
outlook for a strong profit recovery at Japanese exporters like
car and auto parts makers.
 Bridgestone has forecast the dollar to average 91 yen and the
euro 115 yen this year.
 The greenback was trading around 84.60 yen at 0930 GMT on

 Arakawa said that every one-yen decline in the dollar trims
its annual revenues by 17 billion yen ($202 million) and
operating profit by 1.8 billion yen.

 * World stocks fall for 5th day straight
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen eased from a 15-year high
on Wednesday on a report that Tokyo was considering weakening
its currency, while world stocks fell for the fifth day on
concerns over the global economy sliding back into recession.
 However, a better-than-expected German business sentiment
reading from think tank Ifo helped lift European shares into the
black.
 Crude prices also bounced from a seven-week low as investors
looked for relief in U.S. durable goods and oil inventory
reports due later in the day, though safe-haven gold prices
steadied.
 Nikkei business daily reported Japan's Ministry of Finance
may consider unilateral yen-selling market intervention if
speculators drive up the currency. The dollar has lost nearly 9
percent against the Japanese currency this year.
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reinforced that view,
telling reporters that recent yen moves were one-sided and Tokyo
will respond appropriately when necessary.
 But some in the market said it was unlikely the Japanese

 ""I think it's unlikely there would be intervention much

 ""Price action is not disorderly and the yen is not

 The dollar was up 0.7 percent at 84.56 yen, though it was
down 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies.
 The yen also fell from a nine-year peak against the euro.
 However, Tokyo's Nikkei average lost 1.7 percent to hit a
16-month closing low on disappointment over the lack of policy
action by the authorities to rein in the strong yen, which
threatens a fragile economic recovery.
 Illustrating the concerns over global growth, miner BHP
Billiton said it was cautious on the short-term outlook and that
the economy in China, its biggest customer, would slow from
recent highs.
 World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
dropped 0.2 percent for the fifth straight session, and the
Thomson Reuters global stock index lost 0.2 percent.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 drifted 0.1 percent higher, aided
by the Ifo results.
 A one-notch downgrade of Ireland's debt rating by Standard &
Poor's sent a reminder of the problems that the euro zone
peripheral economies faced with their debt.
The cost of protecting Irish government bond from default
rose, with the five-year credit default swaps up 3 basis points
(bps) to 310 bps.
 The 10-year Irish/German government bond yield spread
widened by 4 bps to 334 bps.
 ""The strong corporate earnings we got during the summer had
eclipsed the euro zone's sovereign debt fears in investors'
minds, but this downgrade is a reminder that the problems have
not gone away,"" said Christian Jimenez, fund manager and
president of Diamant Bleu Gestion in Paris.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year German Bunds were up 2 bps at
2.206 percent, while those on 10-year U.S. Treasuries were up 2
bps at 2.5163 percent.
 Oil prices rebounded 0.9 percent to trade above $72 a barrel
and copper also recovered from a 1.6 percent drop on Tuesday
following a record fall in U.S. existing home sales.

Tokyo stocks, which fell more than 2 percent to a 16-month low,
calculating that the steeper its losses the more likely Japanese
authorities might finally bite the bullet and intervene.
 Analysts were sceptical about just how effective any
intervention by Japan alone would be.
 ""We would expect hedge funds to sell into any intervention,
given that the USD/JPY move is driven by U.S. deflation fears,""
currency analysts at ING said in a note to clients.
 Dismal housing data on Tuesday escalated concerns about the
U.S. economy, prompting a further bout of risk reduction as
stocks traded with heavy losses, increasing demand for safe
havens such as the yen and the Swiss franc.
 The Swissie rallied to an all-time high versus the euro of
1.2988 francs.
 ""Risk-aversion is up, yields are lower and I think
euro/Swiss can continue to come lower. Switzerland's large
surplus makes it a safe haven,"" said Farris at Credit Suisse.
 The euro rose versus the dollar to a session high of
$1.2722 after the German Ifo survey came in above forecasts. 
 Earlier, the currency took a hit after Standard & Poor's
downgraded Ireland one notch to AA- and warned the outlook was
still negative, fanning worries about euro zone sovereign debt
and the banking system..

 ZURICH, Aug 25 (Reuters) - International air freight traffic
grew in July but at a slower pace than in the previous month,
figures showed on Wednesday, offering fresh evidence that the
economic recovery is starting to falter.
 Airline industry body IATA said international scheduled
freight traffic rose 22.7 percent year on year in July, while
international passenger demand rose 9.2 percent.
 Cross-border air shipments, which IATA measures in freight
tonne kilometres, are considered a prime indicator of the health
of world trade.
 ""The recovery in demand has been faster than anticipated.
But, as we look towards the end of the year, the pace of the
recovery will likely slow,"" Giovanni Bisignani, IATA's Director
General and CEO, said in a statement.
 Consumer confidence was fragile, particularly in North
America and Europe.
 ""This is affecting leisure markets and cargo traffic.
Following the boost of cargo demand from inventory re-stocking,
further growth will be largely determined by consumer spending,
which remains weak,"" Bisignani said.
 IATA represents 240 airlines operating 94 percent of all
international traffic. Domestic flights are excluded from its
data.

 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The yen pulled back from 15-year
highs on the dollar and a nine-year peak on the euro on Wednesday
due to chances that Japanese authorities may take steps such as
yen-selling intervention to stem the yen's rise.
 The caution initially stemmed from a Nikkei business daily
report saying Japan's Ministry of Finance may consider unilateral
yen-selling market intervention if speculators drive up the
currency.
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reinforced that view, telling
reporters on Wednesday that recent yen moves were one-sided and
Tokyo will respond appropriately when necessary.
 The yen's surge has also nudged up the previously negligible
chances of monetary easing by the Bank of Japan before its rate
review next month, sources told Reuters. The most likely step
would be to expand the amount or extend the duration of a
short-term funding operation.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent against the yen to 84.37 yen on
short-covering, having pulled up from a 15-year low of 83.58 yen
hit on trading platform EBS on Tuesday. There was also some talk
of dollar-buying by Japanese importers.
 Traders said, however, that the dollar's gains were likely to
be limited with selling interest seen likely to emerge if it
rises toward 85.00 yen.
 Some were sceptical about just how effective any solitary
intervention by Japanese authorities would be.
 ""The bottom line is that it will be difficult to reverse the
yen's firm trend completely even with monetary easing by the BOJ,
which the market has priced in, along with solo intervention by
Japan,"" said Jun Kato, senior manager of investment at Shinkin
Asset Management.
 ""Such moves by the Japanese authorities may weaken the yen
temporarily but there are market players who are waiting to sell
the dollar on its rise. There is a possibility the yen may
strengthen even more.""
 Traders said the dollar's fall could accelerate if it drops
below 83.50 yen, with talk of option barriers on the downside at
levels such as 83.00 yen.
 The euro climed 0.7 percent to 106.75 yen after touching a
nine-year low of 105.44 yen on EBS on Tuesday.
 But the market mood is still one of yen buying as the latest
dismal U.S. home sales data and a renewed slide in stocks has
sent investors scrambling for safe-havens.
 Traders were also closely watching how far the Nikkei average
will fall, calculating that the steeper its losses the more
possible it is that Japanese authorities might finally bite the
bullet and intervene.
 The euro's upside was limited after Standard & Poor's
downgraded Ireland to AA- and warned the outlook was still
negative, fanning worries about euro zone sovereign debt and the
banking system.
 The euro inched up 0.2 percent to $1.2652 after touching a
6-week low of $1.2588 on EBS on Tuesday.
 The single currency fared less well on the Swiss franc,
collapsing to a record low around 1.3015 francs before edging
back to 1.3045 francs, down 0.1 percent on the day.
 ""The overnight session was characterised by a rather sharp
round of risk aversion that started late yesterday, gained
momentum during the European session and became entrenched
following shockingly soft U.S. data,"" analysts at RBC
Capital Markets said in a note.
 ""The yen and Swiss franc were the undisputed winners, with
the Aussie and Canadian dollars making up the rear.""
 A 27 percent drop in existing U.S. home sales caused much of
the damage, knocking the S&P 500 down 1.5 percent and sending
Treasury yields to new lows.
 The data was so bad it sparked talk that the Federal Reserve
could embark on a fresh round of quantitative easing, which
seemed to tarnish the U.S. dollar's claim to be a safe haven.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to one-month
lows on Tuesday and the yen hit a 15-year high as dismal U.S.
housing data added to fears the global economic recovery would
fizzle out.
 Pessimism about global growth has grown infectious in
recent weeks after lackluster U.S. employment and consumer
reports. Fears were affirmed on Tuesday by a report showing
U.S. existing house sales slid way more than expected in July
after the government ended homebuyer tax credits. [nLDE67N1O6]
 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans
said he was concerned about the strength of the U.S. recovery
but saw a return to recession as unlikely.
 Earlier, a Bank of England policymaker said the UK risked
sliding back into recession, adding to broader risk aversion.
The comments drove 10-year British government bond yields near
record lows and 30-year German Bund yields to all-time lows as
investors sought safety. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
 ""The wheels are coming off the recovery,"" said Keith
Springer, president of Capital Financial Advisory Services in
Sacramento, California.
 In New York, major indexes closed at their lowest levels in
seven weeks.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slumped 133.96
points, or 1.32 percent, to 10,040.45. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> lost 15.49 points, or 1.45 percent, to
1,051.87 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 35.87
points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,123.76.
 The bearish tone deepened after the U.S. housing report. It
showed July sales of existing homes dropped a record 27.2
percent from June to an annual rate of 3.83 million units.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected sales would fall 12 percent
to 4.7 million.
 ""The problem that pushed us into recession to some degree
still remains: There's still imbalance in the housing market,""
said Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura Securities
International in New York. ""Even after four years of declines,
housing remains the key threat to the (economic) recovery.""
 Economically sensitive companies were the biggest drags on
the Dow, including plane maker Boeing , which fell 3.7
percent to $60.93. Banks were also among hardest hit, with the
KBW Bank index <.BKX> down 2.2 percent.
 Home building and related stocks slipped but came off their
lows after hitting technical support.
 Major European shares <.FTEU3> shed more than 1.6 percent
and the MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.4

 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> fell 1.3 percent, dipping
below the closely watched 9,000 mark for the first time in 15

 The Nikkei index has shed nearly 15 percent so far this
year, compared with a 2.6 percent fall in the MSCI Asia
ex-Japan index. The 9,000-9,100 range had been strong support
for the benchmark Nikkei since last year.
 BUOYANT YEN
 The yen reached a 15-year high against the dollar and a
nine-year peak against the euro on fears the global economy was
slowing.
 The yen continued its rise as Japanese Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda resisted market pressure to comment on possible
currency intervention. [ID:nTOE67N066] It briefly pared gains
after a Nikkei Business Daily report said Japan's Ministry of
Finance may consider unilateral yen-selling market
interventions to break speculative trades. [ID:nN24264334].
 The dollar  fell as low as 83.57 yen. It was last
trading at 84.12, for a loss of 1.12 percent.
 ""Unless the Japanese step in with something more
definitive, we will see speculative accounts drive the
dollar/yen down to 80 yen,"" said Paul Robson, RBS Global
Banking currency strategist. ""That will hurt the Japanese
economy pretty hard, unless they do something more on the
fiscal side or resort to more quantitative easing.""
 The euro  rose 0.13 percent to $1.2675, rebounding
after the U.S. housing report.
 The scramble for less-risky assets sent the 10-year and
30-year German Bund yields   down
more than 0.1 percentage point to record lows at 2.18 percent
and 2.79 percent respectively.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields declined 0.1
percentage point to 2.50 percent  after earlier
sliding to a 17-month low of 2.47 percent.

There's so much bearishness around the U.S. economy at the
moment and that's casting a pall over equity markets and

 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell
$1.70, or 2.33 percent, to $71.40 per barrel, as doubts about

 (Updates prices)
 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The yen jumped to a 15-year
peak against the dollar on Tuesday on fears the global economy
is slowing, testing Japanese authorities' resolve to stem the
currency's climb.
 The yen's rise accelerated as stop-loss sales were
triggered in euro/yen at around 107 yen after the Japanese
currency hit a nine-year high versus the euro. Traders cited
macro hedge-fund selling of the euro against the dollar.
 The U.S. dollar briefly pared losses against the yen after
the Nikkei business daily reported the Bank of Japan is
considering additional steps to loosen monetary policy. Japan's
Ministry of Finance may consider unilateral yen-selling market
interventions if speculators drive up the currency, the paper
said. [ID:nN24264334]
 Declines in stock markets and far weaker-than-expected U.S.
housing data had already helped buoy the yen and other safe
havens such as the Swiss franc.
 ""The market's obviously on high alert for some form of
intervention, but until we see it, the stronger yen trend will
remain intact,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com
in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""With U.S. yields where they are,
all simple intervention will do is give speculators better
levels at which to buy yen.""
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to
comment on the chance of currency intervention, saying only
that recent currency moves were one-sided and disorderly moves
could harm the stability of the economy and financial system.
For more, see: [nTKX006945] and [ID:nTOE67M02F].
 Traders took his comments as a sign the authorities were
not yet ready to act to curb yen strength.
 The greenback was last trading down 1.1 percent against the
yen at 84.18 yen  after going to a 15-year low of 83.61,
according to Reuters data. It fell to 83.58 yen on electronic
trading platform EBS .
 Dollar selling accelerated after a report showed sales of
previously owned U.S. homes fell to their slowest pace in 15
years during July. [ID:nN24196313]
 Investors ""are buying yen as a hedge against obviously poor
economic news in the U.S. right now,"" said Greg Salvaggio, vice
president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""We
think 80 is clearly the next level (in dollar/yen) now.""
 YEN CROSSES
 The euro traded as low as 105.45 yen  according to
Reuters data and 105.44 on EBS  , its lowest since
2001. It was last at 106.66 yen, down 0.9 percent on the day.
 Technical analysts say the euro could be poised for a fall
toward 105.00 yen though on Tuesday it bounced off interim
support at 105.50 yen, around the low from September, 2001.
 Against the dollar, the single currency rebounded from a
six-week low after the housing data  to trade up 0.1
percent at $1.2671 with a session peak of $1.2718.
 The euro fell to its lowest against the Swiss franc on
Tuesday since the euro's launch in 1999 amid safe haven buying
of the Swiss currency.
 The euro was down 0.8 percent against the Swiss currency at
1.3067 francs after going as low as 1.3050 francs ,
according to Reuters data. The low on electronic trading
platform EBS was 1.3049 francs .
 ""The Swiss franc so far has been benefiting as a proxy of

411,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2010 02:40PM ET</span>","France, Germany against EU budget boost - minister"," BERLIN, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Germany and France have formed a
united front against an increase to the European Union's
funding, France's budget minister said on Tuesday, joining
Britain in opposition to a proposed EU-wide tax to fund the
bloc's growing budget.
 After meeting German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in
Berlin, Francois Baroin said the two agreed Brussels' proposal
for a budgetary increase was out of line at a time when its
member states were enacting austerity measures.
 ""We can't ask for deficit reduction on the one hand, to
adhere to the logic of the stability pact, and on the other
hand make demands for increases which are objectively
inadmissible. We confirmed this point.""
 A senior EU official said this month the European
Commission is preparing proposals for an EU-wide tax that could
fall on bank transactions or air travel to help finance the 140
billion euro budget. For more see [ID:nLDE6781D5].
 With European governments under financial pressure,
officials in Brussels are looking for alternatives to finance
the EU budget, the vast majority of which goes to subsidising
farming and funding structural projects such as road building,
while 4 percent pays for the EU's civil service in Brussels.
 The Commission, the EU's executive body, is due to propose
the size and shape of the 27-country bloc's overall budget for
2014-2020 around the middle of next year.
 Baroin said the demands for an increase made ""little
sense,"" adding he would address the issue during an upcoming
visit to Britain.
 ""My colleague Schaeuble and I wanted to confirm this
objective, regardless of the evolution of the debate at the
European Parliament over this essential question. I will take
the same steps with my British colleagues in a few days so that
the largest (budget) contributors are heard.""
 British Prime Minister David Cameron went a step further
this month, saying he wanted to see the EU's budget reduced.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The yen jumped to a 15-year
peak against the dollar on Tuesday on fears the global economy
is slowing, testing Japanese authorities' resolve to stem the
currency's climb.
 The yen's rise accelerated as stop-loss sales were
triggered in euro/yen at around 107 yen after the Japanese
currency hit a nine-year high versus the euro. Traders cited
macro hedge-fund selling of the euro against the dollar.
 The U.S. dollar pared losses against the yen after the
Nikkei business daily reported the Bank of Japan is considering
additional steps to loosen monetary policy. Japan's Ministry of
Finance may consider unilateral yen-selling market
interventions if speculators drive up the currency, the paper
said. [ID:nWNAB0467]
 Declines in stock markets and far weaker-than-expected U.S.
housing data had already helped buoy the yen and other safe
havens such as the Swiss franc.
 ""The market's obviously on high alert for some form of
intervention, but until we see it, the stronger yen trend will
remain intact,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com
in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""With U.S. yields where they are,
all simple intervention will do is give speculators better
levels at which to buy yen.""
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to
comment on the chance of currency intervention, saying only
that recent currency moves were one-sided and disorderly moves
could harm the stability of the economy and financial system.

 Traders took his comments as a sign the authorities were
not yet ready to act to curb yen strength.
 The greenback was last trading down 0.9 percent against the
yen at 84.32 yen  after going to a 15-year low of 83.61,
according to Reuters data. It fell to 83.58 yen on electronic
trading platform EBS .
 Dollar selling accelerated after a report showed sales of
previously owned U.S. homes fell to their slowest pace in 15
years during July. [ID:nN24196313]
 Investors ""are buying yen as a hedge against obviously poor
economic news in the U.S. right now,"" said Greg Salvaggio, vice
president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""We
think 80 is clearly the next level (in dollar/yen) now.""
 YEN CROSSES
 The euro traded as low as 105.45 yen , according
to Reuters data and 105.44 on EBS  , its lowest
since 2001. It was last at 106.94 yen, down 0.7 percent on the
day.
 Technical analysts say the euro could be poised for a fall
toward 105.00 yen. It bounced off interim support at 105.50
yen, around the low reached in September, 2001.
 Against the dollar, the single currency rebounded from a
six-week low after the housing data  to trade up 0.2
percent at $1.2681 with a session peak of $1.2718.
 The euro fell to its lowest against the Swiss franc on
Tuesday since the euro's launch in 1999 amid safe haven buying
of the Swiss currency.
 The euro was down 0.8 percent against the Swiss currency at
1.3064 francs after going as low as 1.3050 , according

 The yen  rose to a 15-year high against the U.S.
dollar and a nine-year peak versus the euro  on
Tuesday amid fears the global economy is slowing, testing
Japanese authorities' resolve to stem the currency's climb.
 Nikkei also said in its Aug. 25 morning edition that the
Bank of Japan is considering additional steps to loosen
monetary policy. Depending on market conditions, the policy
board may decide to take action sooner by convening an
extraordinary meeting, according to the report.
 Actions could include boosting its facility that provides
three-month funding at a low 0.1 percent to 30 trillion yen
from the current 20 trillion yen. Extending the funding period
to six months would be another option, Nikkei said.
 The U.S. dollar briefly pared losses against the yen after
the Nikkei report. It was last down 1.1 percent at 84.14 yen,
not far from a session low of 83.61 yen, according to Reuters

 ""With U.S. yields were they are, all simple intervention
will do is give speculators better levels at which to buy

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to one-month
lows on Tuesday and the yen hit a 15-year high as dismal U.S.
housing data added to fears the global economic recovery would
fizzle out.
 Pessimism about global growth has grown infectious in
recent weeks after lackluster employment and consumer reports.
Fears were affirmed on Tuesday by a report showing U.S.
existing house sales slid way more than expected after the
government ended homebuyer tax credits. [nLDE67N1O6].
 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans
said he was concerned about the strength of recovery in the
U.S., but saw a return to recession as unlikely.

 The bearish tone deepened after the U.S. housing report. It
showed July sales of existing homes dropped a record 27.2
percent from June to an annual rate of 3.83 million units.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected sales would fall 12 percent
to 4.7 million.

 ATHENS, Aug 24 (Reuters) - First-half profit at Motor Oil,
dropped 81 percent year on year to 19.6 million euros ($24.72
million) as austerity taxes and adverse forex moves hurt
business, Greece's second-biggest refiner said on Tuesday.
 Motor Oil was hit by a 12.9 million euro one-off corporate
tax imposed by Greece's cash-strapped government. Results were
also affected by hedging losses of 57 million euros due to the
rise of the dollar versus the euro, and the lower value of the
company's oil inventories.
 The result beat analysts' average estimate of 17.8 million
euros in a Reuters poll of analysts as the company's refining
margin, adjusted for inventories, rose to 63.4 dollars per
metric tonne compared with 62.7 dollars last year.
 Motor Oil derives about 90 percent of its profit from its
sole refinery near Athens. To lessen its dependence on the
plant, the company is expanding into electricity and bought last
year the Greek service stations of Royal Dutch Shell.
 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation

 The greenback struck a 15-year low of 83.72 yen on EBS

trading, but was still down 1.3 percent on the day.
 ""The Bank of Japan missed some good opportunities to try to

the prospects for a global economic recovery, demand for the
currency will just keep getting higher,"" said Joe Manimbo, a
currency trader at Travelex Global Business Payments, in
Washington D.C.
 The euro fell to 105.44 yen , its lowest since
November 2001, having dropped past support at around 107.27
yen, the low hit in June. It was last at 106.37 yen, down 1.2
percent on the day.
 Technical analysts say the euro could be poised for a fall
towards 105.00 yen, with interim support seen at 105.50 yen,
around the low reached in September 2001. The 105.00 yen level,

and return to more normal levels as comparisons become less
favorable in future months,"" Emerson said in its filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Orders are an indicator of future revenue.
 They were flat in Emerson's process management segment, its
biggest by revenue. Orders were up by 20 percent or more in
industrial automation, the same pace as in May and June.
 The slowdown was most visible in Emerson's climate
technologies segment, where orders were up 5 percent to 10
percent, down from at least 20 percent growth earlier. The
company said it saw continued strong demand in Asia for its air
conditioning systems but noted comparisons with a year before
were becoming harder.
 Emerson shares closed Monday at $47.10.

 By Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank may
raise borrowing costs sooner than markets expect, given a
healthy economy, booming real estate prices and rate-setters'
expectations that inflation will overshoot its target by 2012.
 With the Swiss franc climbing back toward the record of
1.3070 per euro hit on July 1, markets have been rolling back
their expectations of a hike, and interest rate futures now
point to no increase in the SNB's benchmark rate of 0.25 percent
until mid-2011.
A first post-crisis rate hike at the bank's next policy
review on Sept 16 is unlikely in view of the strong franc and a
warning from Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand
that risks to the economic recovery had grown recently.
 But markets may be underestimating central bankers' concerns
about growing inflationary pressures.
 ""SNB policy has long looked increasingly inappropriate
relative to domestic fundamentals,"" said BNP Paribas economist
Eoin O'Callaghan.
 ""The SNB was one of the most aggressive easers of policy in
the downturn, but the economy has outperformed most others in
Europe. That points to hikes coming earlier than elsewhere in
Europe,"" he said.
 The central bank sees growth of around 2 percent this year,
and in June it dropped its pledge to intervene in currency
markets to fight the rise in the franc, adopted during the
crisis in 2009, as deflation risks had dissipated.
 Core inflation -- which removes volatile elements like fuel
-- is still barely above zero. But the SNB sees inflation
exceeding its medium-term stability target of 2 percent in 2012
and hitting 3 percent in early 2013 if rates remain ultra-low.
 ""The way the futures stand right now, they are probably
underpricing the chance of a (rate) move in December or March,""
Credit Suisse economist Fabian Heller said.
 
 FICKLE FRANC
 On Aug. 21, SNB Chairman Hildebrand struck a cautious note
in an interview, saying risks to the economy had grown since
June, given a cooling U.S. recovery.
 Some economists have also argued the SNB will delay
tightening until after the European Central Bank, which is not
expected to hike until late in 2011, so as to prevent an even
stronger franc from harming exports.
 But in the same newspaper interview Hildebrand noted rates
could not remain at current levels, given that price pressures
were set to rise, and economists said his view did not depart
from the SNB's June assessment.
 ""Markets want to hear they're going to stay on hold forever,
because that's the majority of the positioning,"" UBS economist
Reto Huenerwadel said of the comments by Hildebrand, whom he
sees as more dovish than his two SNB colleagues.
 Further underscoring potential price pressures, unions want
pay rises of 3 percent for 2011.
 ""In Switzerland, CPI for most of the time has moved hand in
hand with wage increases,"" Huenerwadel said.
 While Hildebrand said in the interview a stronger currency
would eventually hit exports, it is unclear at what pace export
growth would slow.
 Swiss exports posted year-on-year growth in the past three
months despite the strong franc, and export-dependent firms such
as car parts maker Rieter saw sales rise.
 The head of Switzerland's leading research institute,
Jan-Egbert Sturm, said the global recovery was driving the
recent surge in Swiss exports, which generally depended more on
changes in foreign demand than in the exchange rate.
 
 LOW LIBOR
 There is a historical precedent for unexpected action on
rates.
 In June 2004, when current Chairman Hildebrand and
Vice-Chairman Thomas Jordan were already at the SNB, the bank
surprised with a 25 basis point increase after an extended
period of low rates coupled with a strong franc, moving prior to
the ECB.
 The franc LIBOR rate had drifted above the SNB's target rate
prior to that move.
 For the time being, 3-month LIBOR remains below the SNB
target, though the bank is draining the money generated to
cushion the economy during the financial crisis already via
reverse repos and issuance of its own debt.
 ""The risk of us seeing something in September is pretty
low,"" Heller of Credit Suisse said. ""(But) one doesn't have to
wait on the LIBOR before giving the signal,""
 Raising rates would help put a lid on accelerating Swiss
real estate prices. In June the SNB cautioned about lax lending
standards, after the prices of private houses rose 4 percent
last year and those near Geneva by 8 percent.
 Tighter control of mortgage allotments would be the other
way of limiting a mortgage bubble, economists have said.
 ""There are of course regulatory measures, but in
international comparison Switzerland already has a very high
level of regulation,"" Heller said. ""The more likely (option) in
our view is that the SNB does first something on rates.""

 By Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 24 (Reuters) - South Africa's government
and unions are facing increased pressure to end a nearly
week-long state workers' strike from a public angry at the
mounting impact the stoppage has had on the poor.
 The strike by about 1.3 million state workers including
nurses, teachers and clerks, has shut schools, delayed treatment
at hospitals and the delivery of other services to those who
have no other alternative than seek government help.
 Some HIV-infected people have been unable to receive the
daily cocktail of medication that keeps them alive; pregnant
mothers have been turned away from public hospitals and the
working poor are having to stay at home to take care of children
who would normally be in school.
 ""Teachers should know better. It's the children who will
have to suffer and that damage cannot be repaired whether
teachers get their increases or not,"" said James Langa, a parent
from Soweto, a sprawling township outside Johannesburg.
 In what has become a daily occurrence, strikers have
blocked patients from entering hospitals, assaulted co-workers
trying to break through picket lines and abused children showing
up to schools hoping there will be classes.
 ""What they are doing to ordinary people is unfair,"" said a
caller on a popular radio programme.
 Talks between the government and the unions are unlikely to
take place until after President Jacob Zuma returns from a trip
to China that ends on Thursday.
 
 UNIONS
 The unions have tried to win support by saying top level
bureaucrats had lavish lives and the state should be able to
afford wage raises because it has more than enough money to bail
out its corporate partners.
 ""The government ministers who deny workers their meagre wage
increase have spent millions of rand on luxury vehicles and are
living caviar lifestyles at the expense of the poor majority
that is dependent of government service,"" said a statement by
the NEHAWU union representing education and healthcare workers.
 While salaries may be considered high at the top of the
government pay-scale, mid-level state workers make about 40
percent more a month than the average working South African.
 Richer South Africans, who send their children to schools
where teachers have not walked off the job and can seek
treatment at private hospitals, have mostly been unaffected by
the strike.
 Market players said it has had no great impact on daily rand
and bond trading but they see a strike that extends into
September hurting sentiment and raising worries about the costs
to businesses coming from decreased productivity and paperwork
delays at government agencies.
 One newspaper said it might be costing the country about 1
billion rand ($135 million) a day.
 The strike will add to worries about prospects for growth as
Africa's largest economy slowed more than expected in the second
quarter of 2010 as mining contracted while expansion in
manufacturing was lower than before. 
 Zuma's ruling African National Congress government said it
could not afford workers' demand of an 8.6 percent wage rise,
more than double the inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($137.1) a
month as a housing allowance. 
 Any agreement to end the dispute is likely to swell state
spending by about 1 to 2 percent, forcing the government to find
new funds just as it tries to bring down a deficit totalling 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers said members at
a Rio-Tinto-BHP Billiton joint venture will vote on a strike
after the company failed to meet wage demands.

 (Adds detail, quotes, byline, updates prices)
 By Nigel Hunt
 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Coffee, sugar and cocoa futures
all fell on Tuesday, swept along in a broad-based fall in oil
and commodity markets linked to increased risk aversion as
global equity markets weakened.
 ICE arabica coffee, which surged to the highest level in
nearly 13 years on Monday, fell by more than four percent while
Liffe robustas tumbled almost eight percent.
 Raw sugar on ICE slid more than three percent despite some
supportive fundamentals including crop concerns in Russia and
Pakistan, dealers said.
 ""There is a bullish story to be told about sugar but yet it
is down because everything is being pulled along in the wake of
the macro news,"" said VM Group analyst Gary Mead.
 World stocks fell on Tuesday as investors fretting about an
anaemic global recovery dumped risky assets and fled into
government debt and other safe-haven assets including the yen,
which hit a 15-year high against the dollar.
 ICE December arabica coffee hit a low of $1.7520 before
recovering slightly to $1.7685 by 1205 GMT, still well below
Monday's peak of $1.8865, the highest level since September
1997.
 ""It (coffee) is a rally which was forced up by people
covering short position and it is pausing for breath,"" Mead
said, adding the run-up in prices had been largely driven by
technical factors rather than fundamentals.
 ""The only (fundamental) thing you can point (fuelling the
rally) is the continuing drip feed decline in certified stocks
in both New York and London,"" he added.
 Liffe robustas initially tracked the setback in arabicas but
the fall accelerated rapidly as stops were hit.
 November robustas fell nearly eight percent to a low of
$1,637 a tonne, a two-month low for the second position, and
stood $135 lower at $1,642 a tonne at 1205 GMT.
 
 STRONG EXPORTS
 Dealers said strong Vietnamese robusta exports were a
background influence but not a key driving force behind the
decline in prices on Tuesday.
 ""There has been good availability from Vietnam for sure but
that's a background factor, it's certainly not caused the move
today. Almost certainly this move is on how funds have
positioned themselves in the market,"" a London-based analyst
said.
 ""The market broke through technical levels and it's not
seeing much industry support.""
 Vietnam's coffee exports in August jumped 57.4 percent from
the same month last year to an estimated 85,000 tonnes, or 1.42
million bags, the government said on Tuesday.
 Sugar also lost ground as prices for a wide range of
commodities declined.
 ""A gloomy macro picture seems to be weighing on the market
this morning...Oil is weak and posting new recent lows and the
dollar is stronger,"" brokers Sucden Financial said in a market
note on Tuesday.
 October raws on ICE fell more than four percent to a low of
19.20 cents a lb while October whites on Liffe slid nearly three
percent to $560.50 a tonne.
 Cocoa futures on ICE also fell although prices on Liffe
showed more modest losses, underpinned by a weak pound and a
widening nearby premium.
 The rising premium revived some concerns about tightness in
available supplies to deliver against the September contract.
 December cocoa on ICE fell $34 or 1.2 percent to $2,800 a
tonne while December cocoa on Liffe eased 0.7 percent to 2,001
pounds a tonne.

 * Shortage of imported fertiliser
 * Government expects average grain crop
 
 By Olga Dzyubenko
ARAVAN, Kyrgyzstan, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Farmers in southern
Kyrgyzstan, despite a reasonable harvest, are struggling to make
ends meet as they cannot sell their vegetables across borders
closed after the worst violence in the country's modern history.
 Potatoes have rotted in the fields around Osh, epicentre of
the savage ethnic clashes that killed nearly 400 people in June,
while the next grain crop could be harmed by farmers' inability
to import fertilisers, officials told Reuters.
 ""We grew 20,000 tonnes of potatoes and couldn't sell them,""
said Shavkatbek Sabirov, head of the agricultural collective in
Aravan, a village of about 100 people outside Osh.
 ""This has cost us 250 million som ($5.4 million).""
 The interim government of Kyrgyzstan, an impoverished
Central Asian state hosting Russian and U.S. military air bases,
expects the economy to shrink by 5 percent this year after the
violence, which left thousands of people homeless in the south.
 The Agriculture Ministry expects a 2010 grain crop of around
870,000 tonnes, close to the average for the last few years. By
comparison, northern neighbour Kazakhstan expects to harvest
between 13.5 million and 14.5 million tonnes of grain this year.
 Moris Alimbekov, head of the crop science department in
Kyrgyzstan's Agriculture Ministry, said the violence would lead
to a decline in production of some crops. But a bigger problem,
he said, was the closure of the border with Kazakhstan.
 ""This has really hit supplies of food products from the
south of the country,"" he said. Kazakhstan has reopened some
border posts, but applies tight controls on goods shipments.
 ""Uzbekistan has completely closed its border and torn up
agreements on fertiliser supply indefinitely,"" Alimbekov said.
""There was some cross-border trade, but there isn't any more.""
 
 ROTTEN POTATOES
 Aravan is like many other regions of southern Kyrgyzstan.
Irrigation canals through the Ferghana valley where the country
meets with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan ensured a reasonable early
crop this year, mainly potatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables.
 But around a quarter of the village's potato crop rotted
after farmers were unable to find buyers, Paizullo Mirzabaramov,
head of the Aravan regional administration, told Reuters.
 Farmers found some buyers locally, but prices were far below
those achieved last year, when the majority of the region's
vegetables were exported to southern Kazakhstan, he said.
 Aravan's population, two-thirds ethnic Uzbek, was relatively
unscathed by the June violence, although many of the 400,000
people who fled at the height of the clashes crossed the region.
 About a quarter of these refugees crossed into Uzbekistan
before the border was closed.
 Now, the absence of fertiliser imports has led locals to
worry about the year's second crop, comprising mainly sunseeds,
maize and feed grains.
 Kyrgyzstan's interim government has said it will provide for
the country's food security, and that part of the $1.1 billion
pledged by international donors in July would be devoted to
agriculture.
 ""Winter is coming soon. We need to feed our children,"" said
Mirzabaramov.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The yen struck a 15-year high
against the dollar and a nine-year peak against the euro on
Tuesday as investors and speculators tested the resolve of
Japanese authorities to stem the yen's steady rise.
 The yen rise accelerated as stop-loss sales were triggered
in euro/yen at around 107 yen while traders cited macro
hedge-fund selling of the euro against the dollar.
 Falls in shares helped buoy the yen on the crosses while
narrowing differentials between U.S. Treasuries and Japanese
government bond yields dragged the dollar down against the yen.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to comment
on the chance of currency intervention, saying only that recent
currency moves were one-sided and disorderly moves could harm
the stability of the economy and financial system. [nTKX006945]
 Traders took those comments as a sign the authorities were
not yet ready to act to curb yen strength.
 ""Unless the Japanese step in with something more definitive,
we will see speculative accounts drive the dollar/yen down to 80
yen,"" said Paul Robson, RBS Global Banking currency strategist.
 ""The 85 yen level was pretty important and now with that
gone, dollar/yen falling to 80 is a real possibility. That will
hurt the Japanese economy pretty hard, unless they do something
more on the fiscal side or resort to more quantitative easing.""
 The greenback struck a 15-year low of 84.15 yen on EBS,
before inching up to 84.26 yen by 1123 GMT, still 1 percent
lower on the day.
 ""The market knows full well that the options in front of the
Japanese authorities are pretty limited,"" said Neil Mellor,
currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""Any intervention will have limited shelf life, so now the
Bank of Japan has to formulate policies which can undermine the
yen's strength. This will not be easy and we could still be
headed towards the 105 yen mark for euro/yen.""
 The euro fell to 106.11 yen , its lowest since
November 2001, having dropped past support at around 107.27 yen,
the low hit in June. It was last at 106.37 yen, down 1.2 percent
on the day.
 Technical analysts say the euro could be poised for a fall
towards 105.00 yen, with interim support seen at 105.50 yen,
around the low reached in September 2001. The 105.00 yen level,
where Japanese authorities were reported to have intervened in
November 1999, was also seen providing support.

 The euro  also fell to a six-week low against the
dollar of $1.2602, opening the way to a fall towards $1.2522 and
then $1.2479, daily lows from July.
 
 JAPANESE AUTHORITIES
 Traders said the chances Japanese authorities would take
fresh measures in the coming weeks to stem the yen's rise had
increased, particularly as the dollar approaches 80 yen.
 Sources said the yen's surge on Tuesday had somewhat
increased the previously negligible chances the Bank of Japan
will ease monetary policy before its rate review next month.
[ID:nTKF106985]
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa discussed the yen by phone on Monday, but Kan did not
ask the central bank to ease monetary policy further, and the
two did not touch on currency intervention. [ID:nTOE67M02F]
 ""Japanese policymakers will be desperate to prevent a break
in dollar/yen down to 80 but that looks the trend,"" Chris
Turner, head of fx strategy at ING, said in a note.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday as
investors fretting about an anaemic global recovery dumped risky
assets and fled into government debt and other safe-haven assets
including the yen, which hit a 15-year high against the dollar.
 Recent data, particularly from the United States, has
suggested the global upturn is faltering despite the extension
of accommodative policy measures in many countries.
 Comments from a Bank of England policymaker that the UK
risked sliding back into recession added to broader risk
aversion, driving 10-year British government bond yields near
record lows and 30-year German Bund yields to all-time troughs
as investors sought refuge in government debt. Bond yields move
inversely to prices.
 Major European shares shed more than 1 percent, and S&P 500
futures were down 0.7 percent by 1016 GMT, pointing to a lower
start on Wall Street.
 ""The market is looking for any sign of weakness... There's
so much bearishness around the U.S. economy at the moment and
that's casting a pall over equity markets and helping government
bonds,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA Capital Markets
 Japan's Nikkei average fell 1.3 percent, dipping below the
closely watched 9,000 mark for the first time in 15 months,
pressured by selling from hedge funds and foreigners.
 The MSCI world equity index fell 0.7 percent to retest
one-month lows. The Thomson Reuters global stock index was 0.6
percent lower.
 The Nikkei index has shed nearly 15 percent so far this
year, compared to a 2.6 percent fall in the MSCI Asia ex-Japan
index. The 9,000-9,100 range had been strong support for the
benchmark Nikkei since last year.
 
 BUOYANT YEN
 The retreat in equities buoyed the yen to a fresh 15-year
high against the dollar and a nine-year peak against the euro
after Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda again resisted
market pressure to comment on currency intervention.
 Noda said recent currency moves were clearly one-sided and
that disorderly moves could be harmful to the stability of the
economy and the financial system.
 The dollar fell as low as 84.34 yen on trading platform EBS,
a fall of around 0.7 percent on the day, while the euro dropped
more than one percent to around 106.35 yen.
 The dollar was last traded 0.8 percent down versus the yen
at 84.39 and the euro 1.14 percent weaker at 106.43.
 ""Unless the Japanese step in with something more definitive,
we will see speculative accounts drive the dollar/yen down to 80
yen,"" said Paul Robson, RBS Global Banking currency strategist.
 ""The 85 yen level was pretty important and now with that
gone, dollar/yen falling to 80 is a real possibility. That will
hurt the Japanese economy pretty hard, unless they do something
more on the fiscal side or resort to more quantitative easing.""
 Against the dollar, the euro fell to a six-week low of
$1.2614 on EBS.
 The scramble for less risky assets sent the 10-year and
30-year German Bund yields down more than 4 bps on the day to
record lows at 2.214 percent and 2.871 percent respectively.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were down five bps on
the day at 2.546 percent, hovering near 17-month lows close to
2.53 percent struck last Friday.
 Gold prices slipped to their lowest in almost a week as
falling equities prompted investors to sell bullion to cover
losses, while a firmer dollar also put pressure on gold.
 Spot gold was bid at $1,217 an ounce by 1042 GMT, against
$1,223.40 late in New York on Monday.
 Crude oil lost almost a dollar to $72.18 a barrel, a
seven-week low, as doubts about the ability of top oil consumer
the United States to work through record stocks weighed on
sentiment.

 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko
Noda said on Tuesday he was watching currency moves with great
interest as recent moves were clearly one-sided, toning up his
warning against sharp yen gains, but his remarks were not strong
enough to stop the market from pushing the yen higher.
 The Japanese currency rose to a fresh 15-year high against
the dollar and a nine-year high against the euro after Noda's
comments, which traders said gave no indication that Japanese
authorities were ready to step into the market to curb yen
strength.
 ""It's clear that recent currency moves are one-sided.
Excessive and disorderly currency moves could have a negative
impact on the stability of the economy and the financial system,""
Noda told reporters in a hastily arranged news conference.
 ""I consider currency moves to be very important and am
watching currencies with great interest.""
 The remarks were a somewhat stronger warning against yen
gains than his past comments, in which Noda only said he was
watching market moves carefully.
 Noda declined to comment on the chance of currency
intervention.
 ""The yen's rise has really picked up speed now, but all we're
hearing are really restrained comments,"" said Hiroichi Nishi,
general manager, equity division, Nikko Cordial Securities.
 ""What the market wants to see is a more resolute attitude, a
more resolute response. But all they're doing is verbal
intervention, over and over.""
 Japanese policymakers have tried to talk down the yen as a
strong yen clouds the outlook for the country's export-reliant
economy, which is already slowing.
 But the verbal intervention has failed to keep yen gains in
check, as traders are sceptical that Tokyo would resort to
yen-selling intervention or that any such measure would be
effective.

 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The yen struck a 15-year high
against the dollar and a nine-year peak against the euro on
Tuesday as investors tested the resolve of Japanese authorities
to intervene and stem the yen's steady rise.
 The yen rose as stop-loss sales were triggered in the
euro/yen pair at around the 107 yen level amid talk of macro
hedge-fund selling in the euro against the dollar.
 Falls in stock markets also helped buoy the yen broadly on
the crosses while narrowing yield differentials between U.S.

yen's strength. This will not be easy and we could still be
headed towards the 105 yen mark for euro/yen.""
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda was scheduled to
hold a news conference at 0800 GMT.
 The euro fell to as low as 106.80 yen on trading platform
EBS, its lowest since November 2001, having fallen past support
at around 107.27 yen, the trough hit in June. The euro fell to a
six-week low against the dollar of $1.2614 on EBS.
 The greenback struck a 15-year low of 84.48 yen on EBS, down
0.6 percent. Helping the yen's recent rise against the U.S.
dollar was its strong correlation with spreads between two-year
U.S. and Japanese government bond yields.
 The low-yielding yen is a funding currency for carry trades
and can rise in times of market stress or when equities slide.
 
 JAPANESE AUTHORITIES
 With the yen hitting a nine-year peak against the euro and a
15-year high against the dollar, traders were wary about the
potential for measures by Japanese authorities to stem the yen's
rise.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa discussed the yen and agreed to work closely
in a phone conversation held on Monday, but Kan did not ask the
central bank to ease monetary policy further, and the two did
not touch on currency intervention either.
 That left the market disappointed after many expected bold
moves from the Japanese authorities. Market players say the most
likely response from Japanese authorities may be for the BOJ to
increase the size or extend the duration of its three-month
fixed rate fund supply operation.
 But traders were sceptical that Japanese authorities would
resort to yen-selling intervention unless the currency's rise
picks up more speed.
 ""Japanese policy makers will be desperate to prevent a break
in dollar/yen down to 80 but that looks the trend,"" Chris
Turner, head of fx strategy at ING said in a note.

 TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Japan should show it is ready to
intervene in currency markets, the chief executive of Tokyo Stock
Exchange said on Tuesday, reflecting worries about the damage a
stronger yen is causing the nation's exporters.
 ""Japan is giving the impression now that it won't intervene.
It has to show that it can do so,"" the bourse's CEO Atsushi Saito
said at a regular monthly news conference.
 ""Japan needs to show its presence (in the market),"" he added,
highlighting concerns among investors and business executives
about the yen, which hit a nine-year high against the euro on
Tuesday and edged closer to a 15-year high against the dollar.
 The benchmark Nikkei average hit a 15-month closing low below
9,000 points on Tuesday, with hedge funds and foreign investors
selling amid mounting concern about the authorities' inaction on
the threat posed by the yen to a fragile economic recovery.
 Saito's remark had little impact on share prices or the yen,
which was around 84.90 yen to the dollar, heading towards its
15-year high of 84.72 yen hit earlier this month.
 Japanese policymakers have been trying to talk down the yen,
but markets doubt Tokyo will intervene in the currency market as
doing so would need the consent of its U.S. and European
counterparts. Many traders also doubt if intervention by Japan
alone would be effective in curbing the yen.

(Adds Nokia comments on development programme, Intel comment on
processors)
 By Tarmo Virki, European technology correspondent
 OULU, Finland, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Nokia and Intel said on
Tuesday their venture to create a new cellphone software, seen
as crucial for Nokia to re-assert itself as the leading producer
of high-end handsets, had made a solid start.
 Nokia controls 40 percent of the smartphone market with its
Symbian software but has lost its leading position among the
most expensive models to the new rivals.
 Nokia hopes the new MeeGo software, being developed with
chipmaker Intel, will help it in its battle against Apple's
iPhone and Google's Android at the top end of the cellphone
market.
 ""Take-up (from software developers) is really positive,""
Mika Setala, director of industry alliances at Nokia, told
reporters on a conference call.
 ""The MeeGo community is active, vibrant,"" said Martin
Curley, head of Intel Labs Europe.
 Nokia and Intel unveiled their plan in February to create
MeeGo, a merger of Nokia's Linux Maemo software platform with
Intel's Moblin, which is also based on Linux open-source
software.
 The companies unveiled the first version of the software to
developers over the summer. Nokia's chief technology officer
said there would be more to come but there was a hint of caution
in when the market might see the final product.
 ""We are adopting a policy of releasing early and releasing
often,"" Rich Green told Reuters in an interview. ""A huge amount
of functionality has been generated, but there is still quite a
bit to go ... (there is a) significant amount of work is still
to do.""
 
 TOUGH TIMES
 Nokia's Symbian operating system has yet to attract a large
number of software developers interested in creating compatible
applications, a key selling point for high-end cellphones.
 The company's failure to roll-out successful high-end
cellphones, which have fatter margins, has hit the company's
profits and share price hard over the last few years.
 In the middle of last year, Apple surpassed Nokia as the
handset maker generating the largest total profit, despite
selling only one iPhone for every 13 phones Nokia sells.
 Nokia's Setala said the two companies were still looking at
creating joint hardware, a plan they mentioned at the
announcement of their cooperation agreement last year.
 Analysts have said the chip-and-chipset platforms from
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor firm, are too
power-hungry for cellphones when compared with those based on
ARM architecture. But Intel technology chief Justin Rattner said
this was set to change with its new processors. 
 Nokia and Intel on Tuesday opened a new research centre in
Oulu, northern Finland, to look into improving user interfaces
for mobile devices. They said they plan to focus on developing
3D technology.
 ""Augmented reality powered by rich 3D user interfaces can
transform the phone as we know it into a remote control of your
Internet,"" said Christian Lindholm, a managing partner at design
agency Fjord who works on projects to improve the usability of
mobile phones.
 ""As I look at the success of 3D movies I believe there will
be strong development of 3D displays as well,"" said the new
facility's director Heikko Huomo.
 At 1348 GMT, Nokia shares were down 1.8 percent in Helsinki
and Intel was down 0.8 percent in New York.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Tuesday,
with Japan's Nikkei index closing below a key support level as
investors fretted about an anaemic global recovery, while the
Japanese yen hit a nine-year high against the euro.
 Recent data, particularly those from the United States and
Europe, have showed signs of fatigue of the global economy

countries, prompting investors to shun riskier assets.

 Overnight, both the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> and

investors optimism.
 YEN BUOYANT
 The euro sank to a nine-year low against the yen as the
loss of key chart support led speculators to short the currency
in the hope of forcing stop-loss sales against both the yen and
the dollar.
 The euro fell as low as 107.21 yen , its lowest
since November 2001. It later edged back to 107.35 yen, down
0.4 percent on the day.
 Against the dollar, the euro hit a six-week low of $1.2620.
 Bears were targeting $1.2605, the 50 percent retracement of
the euro's rise from a four-year low of $1.1876 in June to its
August peak of $1.3334. A break here would open the way to at
least $1.2522 and then $1.2479, daily lows from July.
 The August euro zone purchasing managers index for
manufacturing, which drove a large part of the economy's return
to growth in the third quarter of last year, saw its pace of
growth slowing, data showed on Monday. [ID:nLDE67M10B]
 With the yen hovering near a 15-year high against the

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The euro hit a nine-year low
against the yen on Tuesday as the loss of key technical support
led speculators to short the currency in the hope of forcing
stop-loss sales against both the yen and the dollar.
 Falls in Asian equities helped buoy the yen against the euro
and broadly on crosses. There was also some talk of macro
hedge-fund selling in the euro against the dollar.
 ""Some stops can be seen in the euro starting from a little
above 107.00 yen. If those are hit, things could get a bit
nasty,"" said a trader for a major Japanese brokerage house.
 The euro fell to as low as 107.21 yen on trading platform
EBS, its lowest since November 2001. After trimming some losses,
the euro last stood at 107.36 yen, down 0.4 percent on the day.
 Against the dollar, the euro hit a six-week low of $1.2620 on
EBS.
 After trimming some of its losses, the euro stood at $1.2628,
down 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday.
 Bears were targeting $1.2605, the 50 percent retracement of
the euro's rise from a four-year low of $1.1876 in June to its
August peak of $1.3334. A break here would open the way to at
least $1.2522 and then $1.2479, daily lows from July.
 YEN BROADLY HIGHER
 The yen was broadly higher and edged back up towards a
15-year peak against the dollar hit earlier in August.
 The greenback dipped 0.2 percent against the yen to 85.02
yen, slipping back towards a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on EBS
earlier this month.
 The trader for a major Japanese brokerage house said there
was talk of bids in the dollar at levels near 85.00 yen to 84.80
yen, but added that stop-loss offers were lurking underneath.
 The low-yielding yen is a funding currency for carry trades
and can rise in times of market stress or when equities slide and
are seen as denting investor risk appetite.
 A trader for a major Japanese bank said that the Nikkei's
drop to a 15-month trough suggests that some Japanese investors
will likely be cautious about taking on additional risk, such as
conducting unhedged overseas investment.
 ""I don't think they can move ... Their risk tolerance will
not rise,"" the trader said.
 With the yen having hit a 9-year peak against the euro and
nearing a 15-year high against the dollar, traders were cautious
about the potential for some kind of measures by Japanese
authorities to stem the yen's rise.
 A drop in the dollar towards 84.00 yen might prompt the BOJ
to take monetary easing steps even before its next monetary
policy meeting in early September, said a trader for a Japanese
bank.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa discussed the yen and had agreed to work
closely in a phone conversation held on Monday, but Kan did not

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and oil prices
gave back early gains and fell on Monday as a slew of corporate
takeover activity, usually a sign of investor optimism, was
outweighed by concerns about the global economy.
 The dollar strengthened against major currencies, including
the euro, which was further hurt by poor European economic data
and prospects of loose monetary policy for a longer period in
the region.
 Stocks initially rose on news of several merger and
acquisition deals, a sign that companies are making use of high
cash balances and historically low borrowing costs to expand
their businesses.
 But M&A activity also means companies will trying to grow
profits through cost-cutting -- a bad omen for the jobs
market.
 ""Overriding the M&A buzz -- which didn't have a lot of
longevity -- is the fact that economic data still remains very
poor and there's concern that the much-discussed soft patch has
the potential to become something greater,"" said Bucky Hellwig,
senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham,
Alabama.
 Campbell Soup Co  was said to be considering a bid
for Britain's United Biscuits, while HSBC started talks to buy

billion worth were playing out on Monday.
 Hewlett-Packard Co  offered $24 a share in cash for
data storage company 3PAR Inc . The $1.6 billion offer
topped a competing bid by technology rival Dell Inc 
and sparked fears of a bidding war, dragging tech stocks down.
For details, see [ID:nN23188685].
 Shares of 3PAR surged 44.6 percent to $26.09, while HP

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday as
euro zone data added to concerns over the economy and investors
bet on prospects of loose monetary policy until year-end.
 Sentiment has begun to turn sour on the single currency
after a rally in late July and early August. Investor focus has
shifted back to the euro zone and away from the U.S. economy.
 Euro support dwindled further on Friday after European
Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Weber said the ECB
should extend its loose monetary stance.
 Adding to the negative sentiment, a survey of euro zone
purchasing managers on Monday showed slower manufacturing
growth in the region in August.
 ""August's deceleration in activity has dented some of the
euro bulls' arguments about economic outperformance vis-a-vis
the United States and as such put a cap on any euro rally for
now,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director for currency research at
GFT in New York.
 The euro ""continues to be hobbled by concerns over the
economic health of the periphery members, and today's mildly
weaker-than-expected results from core Europe have not helped
to assuage those worries,"" he said.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro was down
0.9 percent against the yen at 107.90 yen after falling to its
lowest in nearly eight weeks.
 Against the dollar, the single currency was 0.4 percent
lower at $1.2660. The euro fell as low as $1.2647 after
breaking below its 55-day simple moving average at $1.2677,
according to Reuters data.
 In another technical move, a sell signal on the euro
against the dollar was triggered on Monday when the 12- and
26-day moving average convergence divergence indicator moved
into negative territory for the the first time since July 2.
 The MACD, which is used as an indicator of short-term
momentum, was last at -0.0018.
 Technical analysts said the next support level is $1.2605,
a 50 percent retracement of the euro's rise from a four-year
low of $1.1876 in June to its August peak of $1.3334.
 Figures compiled by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed currency speculators extended euro short
positions in the week ended Aug. 17.
 Data from UBS AG also showed a drop in net investment flows
into the euro zone for a third consecutive week.
 SIGNAL FROM JAPAN
 The dollar was down 0.5 percent against the yen, at 85.22
yen, close to a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit earlier this
month.
 Markets were disappointed that a much-hyped meeting between
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa failed to live up to expectations.
 Both agreed to work closely but offered few clues on
whether further monetary easing was possible. ""Dollar/yen
is headed toward the 85 yen level and for the euro toward
support that comes in just above 107 yen,"" said Tom Levinson,
FX strategist at ING.
 The Australian dollar fell after being dented by political
uncertainty from an inconclusive general election. The currency

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Gold was largely flat
in quiet trade on Monday, as investors awaited key U.S. housing
and GDP data later this week, which could provide support to
the metal viewed as a safe haven in times of uncertainties.
 A firmer dollar against the euro kept gold from rising
further, as new euro zone data added to concerns that economy
recovery could be stalling. Crude oil also fell for a fourth
day in a row due to economic worries. [FRX/] [O/R]
 Last week, the metal had its first three-week rally since
June after data showing new claims for U.S. employment benefits
unexpectedly climbed to a new high, and after the Federal
Reserve downgraded its economic outlook.
 ""All the signs are that for the U.S. economy, the fast part
of the recovery is over, and it is now making modest gains. The
gains are simply not enough to reduce unemployment,"" said
Citigroup analyst David Thurtell.
 ""There are concerns about the flow-on that will have on the
equity markets, so that is helping gold,"" he said. ""There are
also more signs, perhaps, that the Fed will have to do some
more quantitative easing.""
 Spot gold  was at $1,226.50 an ounce at 3:22 p.m. EDT
(1922 GMT), against $1,226.95 late in New York on Friday. U.S.
gold futures for December delivery  settled down 30 cents
at $1,228.50.
 Trading volume in COMEX gold futures was near a one-year
low at just 55,000 lots on Monday during the slower summer
sessions, preliminary exchange data showed.
 Bullion has been on a rising trend on safe-haven demand
amid double-dip recession worries since it bottomed in late
July. Gold rallied to a 1-1/2 month high at $1,237.15 an ounce
last week after a spate of lackluster U.S. data knocked
confidence in the economic recovery.
 Gold could still face stiff resistance at around $1,238 --
the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level, and technical
charts showed daily momentum is turning lower, CitiFX said.

 ""While we remain medium-term bullish, we are still not
convinced that gold is ready for the next move higher in the
near term."" CitiFX said.
 ""We continue to believe that the danger of a correction
lower still exists.""
 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly
Commitment of Traders report showed noncommercial net long
positions in gold futures has climbed in three out of past four
weeks. (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/cys66n)
 A rise in positions held by short-term traders suggested
prices could retreat due to profit taking, analysts said.
 AWAITING U.S. ECONOMIC DATA
 Investment demand for gold has increased in recent
sessions, with holdings of the world's largest gold-backed
exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust , rising by
nearly 13 tonnes last week, its biggest one-week climb since
early June. [GOL/SPDR]
 This week, possible disappointment from the U.S. economic
data, including the existing home sales, weekly initial jobless
claims and GDP data, could boost buying of gold as an
alternative investment, said Zachary Oxman, managing director
of TrendMax Futures.
 Gold has become increasingly expensive compared with the
industrial precious metals in recent weeks as concerns over the
outlook for economic growth have increased. The ratio of gold
to platinum and silver has risen to its highest since early
June. (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/rew56n)
 Silver  was at $18.00 an ounce against $17.98 on

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday, as
new euro zone data added to concerns over the economy and
investors increasingly bet on prospects of loose monetary
policy until year-end.
 Sentiment has begun to turn sour on the single currency,
after a rally in late July and early August, as investor focus
has shifted back to the euro zone and away from the U.S.
economy.
 Euro support dwindled further on Friday after European
Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Weber said the ECB
should extend its loose monetary stance.
 Adding to the negative sentiment, a survey of euro zone
purchasing managers on Monday showed slower manufacturing
growth in the region in August. [ID:nSLAKJE6AH]
 ""August's deceleration in activity has dented some of the
euro bulls' arguments about economic outperformance vis-a-vis
the United States and as such put a cap on any euro rally for

GFT in New York.
 The euro ""continues to be hobbled by concerns over the
economic health of the periphery members, and today's mildly
weaker-than-expected results from core Europe have not helped
to assuage those worries,"" he said.
 In mid afternoon trading in New York, the euro was down 0.7
percent against the yen at 108.03 yen  after falling
to its lowest in nearly eight weeks.
 Against the dollar, the single currency was 0.3 percent
lower at $1.2672 . The euro fell as low as $1.2647 after
breaking through below its 55-day simple moving average at
$1.2677, according to Reuters data.
 In another technical move, a sell signal on the euro
against the dollar was triggered on Monday when the 12- and
26-day moving average convergence divergence indicator moved
into negative territory for the the first time since July 2. 
 The MACD, which is used as an indicator of short-term
momentum, was last at -0.0017.
 Technical analysts said the next support level is $1.2605,
a 50 percent retracement of the euro's rise from a four-year
low of $1.1876 in June to its August peak of $1.3334.
 Figures compiled by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed currency speculators extended euro short
positions in the week ended Aug. 17. For details, see:
[ID:nN20156189].
 Data from UBS AG also showed a drop in net investment flows
into the euro zone for a third consecutive week.
 NO SIGNAL FROM JAPAN
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent against the yen, at 85.30
yen , close to a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit earlier
this month.
 Markets were disappointed that a much-hyped meeting between
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa failed to live up to expectations.
 Both agreed to work closely but offered few clues on
whether further monetary easing was possible. [ID:nTOE67M02F]
 ""The meeting did not have much to offer, including no
mention about being more active in the currency market,"" said
Tom Levinson, FX strategist at ING. ""Dollar/yen is headed
toward the 85 yen level and for the euro toward support that
comes in just above 107 yen.""
 The Australian dollar fell after being dented by political
uncertainty from an inconclusive general election.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - A slew of corporate takeover
activity helped global stocks recover from a one-month low on
Monday, but oil prices fell about 1 percent as the dollar
strengthened against major currencies.
 Despite the improved market sentiment, which also
encouraged some selling of safe-haven U.S. Treasury debt,
stocks trimmed gains later as technology shares plummeted on
Wall Street.
 The euro weakened further, hurt by persistent concerns over
the euro zone economy.
 The recovery in stocks markets was prompted by news of
several merger and acquisition deals, considered a sign that
companies are making use of high cash balances and historically
low borrowing costs to look for bargains and expand their
business.
 ""The whole market is geared to M&A activity,"" said David
Buik, senior partner at BCG Partners. ""We're of the opinion
that the quality of economic data across the world is poor, but
on the other side of the coin there is enough M&A activity out
there to limit any kind of a fall in the immediate future.""
 Among the deals, Campbell Soup Co  may make a $2.3
billion break-up bid for Britain's United Biscuits, owned by
private equity firms PAI Partners and Blackstone Group LP
, the London-based Sunday Times reported. For details,
see [ID:nLDE67L05L].
 HSBC is also in talks to buy a stake in South Africa's
Nedbank in a potential $6.8 billion deal. In Asia, an estimated
$58 billion worth of M&A was playing out Monday.
 Hewlett-Packard Co  offered $24 a share in cash for
data storage company 3PAR Inc. The $1.6 billion offer
tops a competing bid by technology rival Dell Inc  and
fears of a bidding war weighed on HP's shares, dragging tech
stocks down. [ID:nN23188685].
 The three main U.S. stock indexes rose nearly 1 percent
after the market opened but trimmed gains later, with the
Nasdaq turning negative.
 At around noon in New York, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> was up 6.32 points, or 0.06 percent, at
10,219.94, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained

rose 0.19 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of
top European shares closed up 0.67 percent, following three
consecutive session of losses.
 Mining shares gained as financial markets bet Australia's
inconclusive weekend elections would lead to a change of
government, spelling the end to a plan to impose tax on major
iron ore and coal mines.
 The STOXX Europe basic resources index <.SXPP> rose 2.96
percent, while BHP Billiton , Anglo American ,
Antofagasta  and Rio Tinto  gained 0.6 percent
to 1.6 percent.
 U.S. crude oil prices  fell 75 cents, or 1.02
percent, to $73.07 per barrel, as a stronger dollar made it
more expensive for investors using other currencies to buy the
commodity.
 EURO WEAKENS
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies measured by the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>.
 The euro continued its slide, down 0.15 percent to $1.2686,
as it was hurt by concerns about the euro zone economy and
prospects of loose monetary policy for an extended period.

 By Gergely Szakacs and Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank kept its
key base rate on hold at 5.25 percent on Monday as expected, but
warned it may need to hike rates if the country's inflation
outlook or risk assessment deteriorates.
 The bank, which has kept its main rate steady at a record
low for the fourth consecutive month now, lowered its average
inflation projection for this year -- but raised its forecasts
by half a percentage point for both next year and 2012.
 The bank warned of upside inflation risks -- saying risks of
overshooting its 3 percent inflation target have increased --
while also saying Hungary's economic recovery will be slower
than previously expected next year, due to depressed domestic
demand.
 Its comments signalled heightened caution as the bank is
watching risk premia on Hungarian assets and the forint after a
surprise halt of a review of Hungary's loan review by the
International Monetary Fund and the EU last month.
 ""If inflation risks persist or Hungary's risk assessment
deteriorates in a sustained way, these could necessitate an
interest rate hike,"" Governor Andras Simor told a news
conference after the monthly rate meeting.
 The bank discussed three different proposals at its meeting
on Monday: a 25 basis point hike, a 25 basis point cut and
keeping rates on hold, Simor said.
 ""Talk of a rate hike will surprise many. Indeed, we still
see limited inflationary pressures in the economy thus far -
given the weak recovery,"" said Timothy Ash at RBS.
 The central bank sees average inflation declining to 3.5
percent next year and 3.4 percent in 2012, compared with its
previous forecasts for 3.0 and 2.9 percent respectively.
 Simor said the Monetary Council faced a dilemma on the
inflation front, as inflation slowed in July due to a VAT hike
impact disappearing from the base figure, but the bank's fresh
inflation report showed rising inflation risks.
 ""Weighted with risks, a higher inflation trajectory is
unfolding,"" Simor said.
 The Monetary Council said in its statement that the risk
that the inflation target will not be met has increased but it
added that inflation may still return to close to the 3 percent
inflation target due to weak domestic demand.
 Year-on-year inflation slowed to 4.0 percent in July from
5.3 percent in June.
 All the 21 analysts in a Reuters poll last week projected
that the bank would keep its base rate on hold at 5.25 percent
.
 The forint was initially little changed after the rate
decision but it later fell to 283.05 to the euro, down close to
1 percent from 280.35 prior to the rate decision. Dealers said
the forint reacted megatively to Simor's comment on faster
inflation and slower growth which were negative for the economy.

 
 RISKS STAYING
 Poland's central bank will also hold a rate-setting meeting
on Tuesday and is expected to keep its main interest rate
unchanged at an all-time low of 3.5 percent, but several
analysts say a rate hike may come late this year.
 The Hungarian bank last cut its main rate by 25 basis points
in April, and has kept it on hold since then.
 It said on Monday that global risk appetite has increased in
the past months, which improved the risk assessment and demand
for central eastern European assets.
 ""However, Hungary's risk premium has not fallen
significantly. The Government's commitment to maintaining a
sustainable path for the fiscal budget is key to preserving
investor confidence,"" the Council said.
 The forint has regained ground after its July falls and
Hungarian government debt auctions have also gone well despite
uncertainty over the 2011 budget. This uncertainty is seen
prevailing until after municipal elections in October.
 Hungary's new centre-right Fidesz government is not expected
to lay out its economic and fiscal plans ahead of the vote which
it wants to win by a big margin, analysts said.
""Everybody is waiting for the government's 2011 budget plans
-- the National Bank will probably articulate a firmer view
after that in October-November,"" said Gyorgy Barcza at K&H Bank.

 (Updates with graphics)
 By Alexandras Budrys
 MOSCOW, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Drought-stricken Russia's grain
harvest is way down on a year ago so far in August, pointing
toward the need for hefty imports by one of the world's biggest
exporters and supporting grain prices on international markets.
 Russia, last year the world's third largest grain exporter,
has harvested 40.3 million tonnes of grain by Aug 19, or 38
percent less than in 2010, Deputy Agriculture Minister Alexander
Petrikov said in St Petersburg.
 He confirmed the ministry's 2010 crop forecast of 65-67
million tonnes by an optimistic scenario and 60 million tonnes
by a pessimistic one, and domestic consumption needs of 77
million tonnes.
 The figures appear to put Russia's supply/demand balance on
a knife edge, taking into account stocks estimated at between
21.7 million tonnes and 24 million as of July 1, and winter
sowing needs.
 Some 3.6 million tonnes had already been shipped abroad,
according to analysts, before Russia's Aug.15 export ban came
into force.
 Analysts have estimated its imports at 1.5-2 million tonnes,
while a report in Vedomosti daily last week said Russia could
import at least 5 million tonnes.
 The government has denied Russia, whose ambitions to
transform itself into the world's largest grain exporter have
been knocked by a severe drought in many producing regions that
destroyed large swathes of crops, will need imports.
 September wheat futures bounced more than 2 percent on
Monday to $6.94-3/4 a bushel on extra export demand.
 ""Russia will import wheat, that is what the market is saying
as they are not out of the woods yet,"" said Peter McGuire,
managing director of CWA Global Markets in Sydney.
 
 BUYERS LOOK ELSWHERE
 Private clients from Russia's largest traditional buyer,
Egypt, were heard buying an unusually large volume of French
wheat. Buyers said loading of one cargo had been brought forward
from Sept 1-15 and the ship was already loading in Bordeaux.
 Rains have yet to soften the soil for large scale winter
grain sowing, though they are expected on Aug.23-26 in European
Russia, hard hit by the drought. The heat will move east to
Siberia.
 With prospects for winter grain unclear analysts are
putting together scenarios pointing towards big imports.
 Estimating a crop of 60 million tonnes, carryover stocks of
23 million and consumption of 77 million tonnes, as well as 3.6
million tonnes already exported, according to IKAR analysts,
Russia will be left with carryover stocks of just 2.4 million
tonnes by the end of the current crop year on June 30, 2011.
 Taking into account the need to allocate some 11-12 million
tonnes for winter sowing due to start in August, Russia appears
unable to do without imports.
 Analysts have said Kazakhstan and Ukraine may provide some
grain to Russia. The Russian province of Tatarstan has already
asked to buy up to 0.5 million tonnes of grain in Belarus.
 But Belarus Agriculture Minister Mikhail Rusy told reporters
in St Petersburg that Minsk, which harvested less grain than
last year, may provide a more modest volume.

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro edged lower on
Monday, hurt by concerns over the euro zone economy and
prospects of loose monetary policy until year-end, leading
investors to bet against the single currency.
 Currency speculators extended euro short positions in the
week ended Aug. 17, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
said on Friday, as focus shifted back to the euro zone and away
from the U.S. economy.
 Data from UBS AG also showed a drop in net investment flows
into the euro zone for a third consecutive week.
 ""There's a rotation going on, and focus has shifted to

weaker-than-expected results from core Europe have not helped
to assuage those worries,"" he said.
 In morning trading in New York, the euro was down 0.5
percent at 108.19 yen after falling to its lowest in nearly
eight weeks.
 The single currency was 0.1 percent lower at $1.2693 after
hitting a five-week low of $1.2661 on Friday, when European
Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Weber said the ECB
should extend its loose monetary stance, stoking worries about
the euro zone economy.
 Technical analysts said the next support level was the
55-day moving average at $1.2678, followed by $1.2605, a
50-percent retracement of its rise from a four-year low of
$1.1876 in June to its August peak of $1.3334.
 The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 85.18 yen, close to
84.72 yen hit earlier this month, its lowest since July 1995.
 Markets were disappointed that the much-hyped meeting
between Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa failed to live up to expectations.
 Both agreed to work closely but offered few clues on
whether further monetary easing was possible. ""The
meeting did not have much to offer, including no mention about
being more active in the currency market,"" said Tom Levinson,
FX strategist at ING. ""Dollar/yen is headed toward the 85 yen
level and for the euro toward support that comes in just above
107 yen.""
 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR
 The Australian dollar reversed losses after being dented by
political uncertainty from an inconclusive general election.
 The currency fell earlier after neither major party in
Australia won an overall majority in Saturday's election.
 The Aussie traded as low as $0.8864 but it recouped losses
to trade at $0.8961, helped by buying from real-money
accounts.
 ""There are still risks for the Aussie from long positioning
and its sensitivity to global economic data,"" Mackel at HSBC
said.
 The currency received some help after Britain's Sunday
Times reported that beverage giant SABMiller was considering
buying the beer operation of Australian brewer Foster's Group
for about $10.9 billion.

 By Amena Bakr 
 DUBAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is likely
to raise gasoline prices in September, an energy official said
on Monday, as it moves to phase out subsidies that have strained
the budget of the world's third largest oil exporter.
 The official said a price hike might also prompt the
government to hold talks with Oman on imposing quotas to limit
the unregulated flow of cheaper subsidised fuel from the
neighbouring sultanate.
 ""This is the third incremental increase which is leading up
to the target of reaching the international price level,"" said
the official, from the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Company
(ADNOC), adding there was no set date for when prices would
reach international market levels.
 ""For sure, people will be upset when the change happens, but
then they will get used to it and everything will be normal,"" he
said.
 The UAE announced plans earlier this year to gradually
reduce subsidies on gasoline, which cost the government hundreds
of millions of dirhams a year, until prices match international
market levels.
 While national subsidy figures are not made public, the
wealthy oil exporting emirate of Abu Dhabi has spent an average
of $6.5 billion a year for the past four years on various
subsidies, from water to energy, according to official data.
 So far, there have been two incremental increases in the
price, and a third is expected to take place after the Muslim
Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the fasting month of
Ramadan in the first half of September, the source said.
 The increase is likely to add 0.20 UAE dirhams to the cost
of a litre of fuel, which would boost the price of 95-octane
gasoline to 1.92 dirhams ($0.52) a litre, while the same petrol
in Oman costs just $0.31 a litre.
 The anticipated new price in the UAE amounts to about $1.97
per gallon, still lower than the $2.17 benchmark price for U.S.
gasoline futures.
 Fuel demand across the Gulf has risen rapidly as subsidised
prices have encouraged consumption from a growing population
enjoying petrodollar-fuelled economic expansion and gas-guzzling
sport utility vehicles.
 Demand for oil products in the UAE is expected to rise by 3
percent in 2010 to 304,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to
Washington-based consultancy PFC Energy.
 The ADNOC official said the government may hold talks with
Oman to prevent the unregulated flow of cheaper Omani petrol
into the UAE.
 ""As the removal of subsidies goes ahead, I'm sure that at
some point there will be talks with Oman to have quotas on the
fuel that's sold across to UAE customers, who might be trying to
get cheaper fuel,"" the official said.
 ""But I don't think this will happen that much between the
UAE and Oman, because not everyone lives on the border, but if
it does happen it will harm Oman and the national retailers in
the UAE,"" he added.
 In July, top oil exporter Saudi Arabia investigated the
smuggling of subsidised fuel sold for domestic consumption to
international markets.
 Diesel in the UAE is not subsidised and costs around 2.60
UAE dirhams ($0.708) a litre.

 LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro stayed under pressure on

 LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro stayed under broad

which have seen short positions in the single currency extended.
 The Australian dollar recovered losses after being dented by

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - World stocks rose from last
week's one-month low on Monday as a slew of corporate takeover
activity and an encouraging euro zone business survey helped
ease concerns about a global economic slowdown.
 Mining shares gained as financial markets bet Australia's
inconclusive weekend elections would lead to a change of
government, spelling the end to a plan to impose tax on major
iron ore and coal mines.
 A Markit survey showed the euro zone's economic recovery
moderated slightly this month but companies are more optimistic
about the coming months.
 In the corporate sector, increasing merger and acquisition
activity is boosting investor sentiment as companies utilise
high cash balances and historically low borrowing costs to look
for bargain buys and expand their business.
 HSBC is in talks to buy a stake in South Africa's Nedbank
in a potential $6.8 billion deal. In Asia, an estimated $58
billion worth of M&A was playing out on Monday.
 Positive corporate news helped ease concerns that a renewed
spike in U.S. unemployment may drag the economy down, forcing
the Federal Reserve to implement additional monetary easing.
 ""The whole market is geared to M&A activity,"" said David
Buik, senior partner at BCG Partners. 
 ""We're of the opinion that the quality of economic data
across the world is poor, but on the other side of the coin
there is enough M&A activity out there to limit any kind of a
fall in the immediate future.""
The MSCI world equity index rose 0.3 percent after hitting a
one-month low last week. The Thomson Reuters global stock index
added 0.2 percent.
 
 M&A BOOST
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.8 percent. U.S. stock
futures were up 0.6 percent, pointing to a firmer open on Wall
Street later.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from banks
to restaurants, came in at a better-than-expected 55.6 in
August, compared with 55.8 in July.
 Old Mutual was up nearly five percent after HSBC said it
would buy up to 70 percent of Nedbank, in which Old Mutual has a
controlling stake.
 Basic resources shares were the top gainers.
 Foster Group closed up more than 7 percent after sources
told Reuters beverage groups SABMiller and Asahi Breweries were
looking at the Australian brewer's beer operations, valued at
more than $10 billion.
 Thomson Reuters data showed global mergers and acquisitions
have hit nearly $200 billion so far in August.
 Emerging stocks ticked up 0.1 percent on the day.
 U.S. crude oil rose 0.4 percent to $74.11 a barrel, off
Friday's six-week low of $73.19. Prices had fallen more than 10
percent from an Aug 4 high of $82.97 as concerns about the
global economy darkened the outlook for energy demand.
 The bund future fell 18 ticks.
 
 ELECTION RESULTS HIT AUSSIE
 The Australian dollar briefly hit a one-month low of $0.8833
as the country faced a week of political wrangling after
Sunday's inconclusive election.
 The U.S. dollar was down around 0.1 percent against a basket
of major currencies. The yen gained 0.3 percent to 85.32 per
dollar, which in turn weighed on Tokyo stocks.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa discussed the yen on Monday and agreed to work
closely, disappointing those who had expected a bolder policy
response after the yen's surge to 15-year highs beyond 85
earlier this month.
 ""In the absence of a further sharp appreciation of the
exchange rate towards 80 or a disorderly slide in the equity
markets, we do not anticipate any easing of monetary policy
until the scheduled policy meeting due on Sept 6-7, when we
expect a further expansion of the BOJ's funds-supplying
facility,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note to clients.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic recovery
moderated slightly this month but companies are more optimistic
about the coming months despite an ongoing divergence in growth
rates between member countries, a survey showed on Monday.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from banks
to restaurants, slipped to 55.6 in August from 55.8 in July.
 The index has now been above the 50.0 mark that divides
growth in business activity from contraction for a year and
pipped the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for 55.5.
 While the pace has slowed, firms in the 16-nation bloc's
dominant service sector grew more optimistic, driving the
business expectations index up to 68.1 this month from 66.5 in
July.
 ""There is still quite a bit of momentum in the recovery but
we are going to see it ease off from the bumper figures we saw
in the second quarter,"" said Rob Dobson at Markit.
 The bloc's biggest economies Germany and France have picked
up smartly over recent months but this has not been matched in
Spain and Italy.
 The euro zone manufacturing sector, which drove a large part
of the economy's return to growth in the third quarter of last
year, also saw the pace of growth slow.
 The flash manufacturing index fell to 55.0 in August from
56.7 in July, missing forecasts for 56.2, while the output index
dropped to 57.2 this month, from 58.7 in July.
 The composite index, made up from the services and
manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,
dipped to 56.1 this month from 56.7 in July, short of
expectations for 56.4.
 But firms continued to hire workers, although at a slower
pace than last month, with the manufacturing employment index
nudging down to 51.0 from July's 51.1. Unemployment in the euro
zone held steady at 10 percent for the fourth month running in
June.
 DIVERGENCE WIDENING
 The euro zone economy escaped from its worst post-war
recession in the third quarter of last year and preliminary data
showed the economy grew a faster-than-expected 1.0 percent
between April and June.
 It is seen growing 0.4 percent in the current quarter and
then 0.3 percent in the following three quarters.
 Yet, worryingly for policymakers, diverging rates of
recovery in the bloc seen in previous months appear to be
widening.
 ""We are seeing this very much centred on the core nations,
it has not spread to the peripheral nations and in many ways
this divergence is widening,"" Dobson said.
 ""This is like what we saw in the second quarter where we had
strong growth particularly in Germany and partly in France
sitting quite unevenly with muted performance in Spain, Italy
and Greece. So outside of those two main nations conditions are
still subdued.""
 Earlier data on Monday from Germany, Europe's biggest
economy, showed its service sector accelerated at its fastest
pace in three years this month but expansion in its
manufacturing sector slowed from July's near 14-year survey
record high.
 Conversely, in neighbouring France the pace of growth slowed
in its service sector but accelerated for manufacturing firms.
 The euro zone's composite output price index rose to 50.3
this month from 49.4 -- its highest reading since October 2008
and only the second time it has been above 50 since then --
indicating firms were able to pass on some rising costs to
customers.
 Final data released last week showed prices rose 1.7 percent
year-on-year in July, in line with previous estimates and still
below the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling.

 LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The euro stayed under broad
pressure on Monday, hurt by concerns over the euro zone economy
which have seen short positions in the single currency extended.
 The Australian dollar was dented by political uncertainty
after an inconclusive general election.
 The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed
an extension in euro short positions in the week ended Aug. 17
as focus shifted away from specific concerns about the U.S.
economy and back on to the euro zone.
 ""There's a rotation going on and focus has shifted to
conditions in the euro zone again. The market is trying to
capitalise on it,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency
strategy at HSBC.
 Purchasing manager surveys were under scrutiny, with
Germany's manufacturing sector expanding at its slowest pace in
six months, missing the consensus forecast of 60.5.
 At 0725 GMT, the euro was trading down 0.1 percent on the
day at $1.2693, not far from five week lows of $1.2664 versus
the dollar hit on Friday when European Central Bank Governing
council member Axel Weber said the ECB should extend its loose

 Technical analysts said the next support was the 55-day
moving average at $1.2679, followed by $1.2605, a 50 percent
retracement of its rise from a four-year low of $1.1876 marked

 The euro slipped 0.4 percent to 108.35 yen, near a
seven-week low of 108.25 yen hit on EBS on Friday.
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 85.35 yen, within striking
distance of 84.72 yen hit earlier this month, its lowest since
July 1995.
 The greenback has been soft against the Japanese currency,
partly due to a sharp fall in U.S. Treasury yields on the back
of persistent fears the U.S. recovery is losing its momentum.
 The dollar/yen rate has a high correlation with U.S. and
Japanese government bond yield spreads, which are narrowing.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa talked about the yen in a phone conversation
on Monday and agreed to work closely, but offered few clues on
whether further monetary easing was possible.
 ""The yen is expected to stay on a gradual rising trend and
there is the possibility it will strengthen beyond 84 yen (per
dollar) as the market is looking at Japanese authorities being
too tame on economic policy,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist
at Sumitomo Trust & Banking.
 
 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR
 The Australian dollar dropped after neither of the major
parties in Australia won an overall majority in Saturday's
election to form a government, leaving the country facing its
first hung parliament in 70 years.
 The Aussie hit a one-month low of $0.8833 in early Pacific
trade in a knee-jerk reaction to the election. But it trimmed
losses thanks to bargain hunting, rising to $0.8910, down 0.3
percent on the day.
 The currency received some help after Britain's Sunday Times

the beer operation of Australian brewer Foster's Group for about
$10.9 billion.

 By Umesh Desai
 HONG KONG, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Asian stocks steadied on
Monday, underpinned by a rally in Southeast Asian stocks that
drove Jakarta to a record peak as foreign investors keep
chasing its surprisingly strong growth momentum.
 Major European shares opened 0.4 percent higher and futures
for the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq were up 0.1 to 0.2
percent at 0620 GMT, pointing to a slightly firmer start for
U.S. trade.
 Inconclusive weekend elections in Australia briefly pulled
its dollar down to a one-month trough although shares in miners
rose as investors bet a proposed new tax on coal and iron ore
profits may never be introduced.
 A wave of mergers in Asia is also boosting values as
acquirers leverage on relatively lower valuations and cheap
funding costs to buy companies. An estimated $58 billion worth
of mergers involving Asian companies were playing out during
the day.
 ""We are seeing this as an extremely stocks selective
market. In Asia the markets that are holding up better are the
Southeast Asian markets as investors have been very specific
about picking markets where companies have sustainable
earnings,"" said Linda Csellak, head of Asia-Pacific equities at
MFC Global Investment Management (Asia).
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks was flat
with the resources sector outperforming the rest of the market.
 In Japan, where the yen currency has rattled investors in
recent weeks, shares extended losses amid worries a strong yen
would derail the fragile economic recovery.
 The Nikkei average inched to a nine-month closing low,
shedding 0.7 percent and holding just above a critical
technical support at around 9,100.
 The decline follows Friday's 2 percent fall as corporate
performance jitters grew in the wake of the yen's strength
against the dollar.
 ""Governments around the world are allowing their currencies
to weaken, and if Japan doesn't do anything about the strength
in the yen it could appreciate further and that would put
pressure on Japanese stocks,"" said Masahiko Sato, an executive
director at Nomura Securities' equity marketing department.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa discussed the yen and agreed to work
closely in a phone conversation on Monday, but Kan did not ask
the central bank to ease monetary policy further.
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 85.35 yen, within striking
distance of 84.72 yen hit earlier this month, its lowest since
July 1995.
 Indonesia, Asia's second-best performing stock market this
year, rose to an all-time high and Malaysia's index struck its
highest in 2-½ years, outpacing regional giants Australia and
Japan, both of which ended the day with losses.
 Oil rebounded to above $74 a barrel but stayed close to six

490,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2010 02:20AM ET</span>",Russia cbank bought more sovereign bonds in 2009," MOSCOW, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank, holder of
the world's third-largest reserves, said on Monday it had
increased the share of sovereign bonds in its investments in
2009, opting to reduce its risks and accept lower returns.
 At end-2009, 46.4 percent of the central bank's foreign
currency reserves were held in dollar assets, 42.3 percent in
euros, 10.1 percent in sterling and 1.2 percent in the Japanese
yen, the monetary authority said in a report published on its
website.
 Officials have said the nominal structure of the foreign
currency part of Russia's reserves remains unchanged at 47
percent U.S. dollars, 41 percent euros and 10 percent sterling
-- the same as it was a year ago. [ID:nLDE634089]
 Reserves can deviate slightly from that structure on any
particular day.
 ""During the period, the Bank of Russia made conversion
operations on the global currency market with the U.S. dollar,
the euro, sterling and the Japanese yen,"" the central bank
said.
 ""Due to the significant volume of operations with the U.S.
dollar on the domestic market and the changes in the size and
structure of Bank of Russia's obligations in foreign
currencies, the main volume of transactions was the purchase
and sale of other foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar in
order to bring their share in the net foreign currency assets
in line with the nominal indicators.""
 Russia confirmed it had added the Canadian dollar to the
list of reserve currencies from 2010, but gave no details.
 The central bank, which also has the right to invest in
Swiss franc assets but does not currently hold any, has
previously said the share of the Canadian dollar in its
reserves would be smaller than that of the yen. [ID:nLDE60J1YX]
 ""The volume of the Canadian sovereign bond market is
relatively small compared to the biggest markets -- Japan,
United States, euro zone and United Kingdom,"" the central bank
said, but added that the market was well developed.
 On a country basis, 39 percent of reserves was invested in
the United States as of end-2009, 18 percent in Germany, 16
percent in France, 9 percent in Britain, 2 percent in Russia.
 Nearly 90 percent of the $416.9 billion of assets were in
sovereign bonds, 1.7 percent was in other bonds, 7.1 percent on
deposits and accounts and 1.3 percent in repo operations.
 ""To minimise the possible negative impact from the
instability on external markets ... during 2009 the Bank of
Russia reduced the volume of deposits held at foreign
commercial banks and investments into non-sovereign bonds of
foreign issuers,"" the central bank said. It gave no comparative
data.
 ""Investment into foreign sovereign debt was, on the other
hand, significantly increased. Deposits placed with central
banks and the Bank of International Settlements also
increased.""
 The central bank earned $6.3 billion on its investments in
2009.
 ""Investing in instruments of high credit quality partly
determines the fairly low yield of the investments,"" it said.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2010 12:08AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS-Japan stocks slip on yen worries; Aussie rebounds," * Aussie rebounds from one-month low struck after elections
 * Japan eyes PM-BOJ meeting which seen focusing on yen
 * Nikkei seen under pressure if no meeting held -analysts
 By Umesh Desai
 HONG KONG, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Japanese shares extended
losses on Monday amid worries a strong yen would derail the
fragile economic recovery, while the Australian dollar
recovered after falling to a one-month low on inconclusive
weekend elections.
 Broad investor concerns about the global economic recovery
are weighing on regional stocks which fluctuated through
positive and negative territory following a string of weak
economic data releases from the United States last week.
 Political uncertainty pulled the Australian dollar down
initially to a one month trough of $0.8833 but the unit made a
quick rebound to trade at $0.8905, down 0.4 percent.
 Australian stocks also rebounded after an early fall to
trade flat, led almost entirely by a rally in miners on
expectations that Prime Minister Julia Gillard would fail to
form a government, spelling the end of her 30 percent tax on
major iron ore and coal mines. The conservatives have vowed to
scrap the mining tax.
 The reversals in the Aussie and Australian stocks also
followed a media report the country's largest brewer Foster's
Group was selling its beer operations to SABMiller for about 7
billion pounds ($10.9 billion). Foster's shares rose as much as
6.5 percent.
 Investors likely face a week's wait before they know who
will form a national government and how independents will sway
key policies like the mining tax and a planned broadband
network.
 ""There is the mining tax and the broadband issue but there
are not too many economic differences,"" said Simon Burge at ATI
Asset Management which oversees A$500 million. ""But with no
party having a clear majority it makes it hard for them to get
any of their mandates through.""
 YEN STRENGTH EYED
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei was down 0.4 percent adding to
Friday's 2 percent fall as corporate performance jitters grew
in the wake of the yen's strength against the dollar.
 ""Governments around the world are allowing their currencies
to weaken, and if Japan doesn't do anything about the strength
in the yen it could appreciate further and that would put
pressure on Japanese stocks,"" said Masahiko Sato, an executive
director at Nomura Securities' equity marketing department.
 Investors are focused on whether central bank Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa and Prime Minister Naoto Kan will meet to
discuss any official action in the face of the yen's strength.
 News that Kan and Shirakawa talked over the phone on Monday
about the currency and the economy and agreed to work closely,
which came during the mid-day break, was unlikely to have a big
impact as it remained undecided whether the two will hold a
meeting.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 85.35 yen. The U.S.
currency fell as low as 84.72 yen earlier this month, its
lowest since July 1995.
 Investors expect Kan to pressure the central bank for
action in the face of the yen's strength, but Jiji news agency
reported the government is considering postponing the meeting,
which had been expected on Monday, to avoid giving the
impression that it is intervening in the BOJ's policy
decisions.
 Meanwhile, the doubts about the global economic recovery
weighed on investor sentiment.
 ""A growing trend seems to be that signs of a weak global
economic recovery are prompting some funds to close, and
cash-out moves as a result of that are weighing on stocks. That
money is likely flowing into U.S. bonds and JGBs,"" said Hajime
Nakajima, deputy general manager at Cosmo Securities.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks eked out
gains, rising 0.3 percent and hauled up by advances in sectors
such as resources and technology.
 Oil rebounded to above $74 a barrel but stayed close to six
week lows amid concerns about a global economic recovery.

 By Chisa Fujioka and Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa discussed the yen
and agreed to work closely in a phone conversation on Monday,
but Kan did not ask the central bank to ease monetary policy
further.
 The government's chief spokesman said the two did not touch
on currency intervention either, disappointing markets which
had expected a bolder policy response or even a signal of one
after the yen's surge to 15-year highs earlier this month.
 ""There is a sense of disappointment and it is in doubt
whether anything was decided,"" said Hideki Hayashi, global
economist at Mizuho Securities' fixed income research
department.
 Bond yields have fallen and the yen has pared gains in
recent sessions on speculation the BOJ may try to pre-empt
government pressure for action and further loosen its already
ultra-easy policy at an emergency meeting before or shortly
after the talks between Shirakawa and Kan.
 ""They exchanged views on the economic and financial
situation including foreign exchange,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary
Yoshito Sengoku told a news conference on Monday. ""They agreed
that it was important for the government and the BOJ to
communicate closely with each other.""
 Sengoku added that the government wanted to consider
whether Kan and Shirakawa should meet in person, although he
did not give a timeframe.
 Kan did not make any request on monetary policy to the
central bank chief, a BOJ source said,
 The dollar edged down to 85.30 yen from around 85.45 yen
after Sengoku's comments, partly on disappointment that no firm
commitment to monetary easing came out of the talks.
 Sources had told Reuters that Kan and Shirakawa may meet on
Monday to craft a response to the surging yen which is trading
around at its highest level against the dollar since 1995,
threatening to dent Japan's export-reliant economy.
 But sources say the BOJ is unlikely to act before its next
regular policy meeting on Sept. 6-7 unless the yen heads
towards its all-time high past 80 to the dollar at a pace of 2
to 3 yen per day.
 Mizuho's Hayashi said the chat was also part political
performance ahead of a Sept. 14 ruling Democratic Party of
Japan (DPJ) DPJ leadership vote, in which Kan could face a
challenge from party powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, or a proxy
candidate.
 GOVT EYES STIMULUS
 Growth in Japan's economy slowed to a crawl in the second
quarter and analysts see more weakness ahead as the U.S.
recovery sputters.
 The government is trying to compile a package of measures
by early September to support the economy by early September,
which may include extending the deadline for subsidies on
energy-efficient electronics and homes to encourage more
consumer spending.
 A senior Democratic Party official said the ruling party
hopes to compile proposals on the package by Aug. 26, which
will be reflected in the government's stimulus plan.
 While some lawmakers are calling for big spending, the
government is likely to use money redirected from other areas
to fund the stimulus measures given Japan's dire fiscal
straits, making any positive impact on the economy minor.
 Government bond yields at the short end of the curve eased
and the yield curve flattened last week as investors priced in
the chance that the BOJ could ease policy in an attempt to help
combat yen strength and support the economy.
 The two-year bond yield, most sensitive to monetary policy,
hit a five-year low of 0.110 percent last week barely above the
BOJ's policy rate of 0.1 percent, a sign many investors are
already factoring in further monetary easing.
 The most likely next step by the BOJ is to expand a
fund-supply tool it put in place in December last year, and
already expanded once in March, under which it offers up to 20
trillion yen ($233.6 billion) in three-month loans at 0.1
percent.
 But market watchers say the options left for the central
bank are limited and can do little about the firming yen, which
has jumped nearly 9 percent this year as a flood of weak U.S.
economic data undermined the dollar.
 ""The exchange between Kan and Shirakawa is not very
proactive. It is likely that there won't be positive moves over
preventing the strong yen,"" said Yoshikiyo Shimamine, chief
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
 ""This seems like as much as they could do ... The ball is
in the BOJ's hands. The possibility of the BOJ calling an
emergency meeting like they did in December cannot be denied,
but it feels like we won't be seeing a commitment that will be
targeting currencies.""

493,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2010 11:12PM ET</span>",South Africa's Zuma looks to China to boost trade," * China visit is last leg of BRIC economy visit
 * South Africa lagging Brazil, Russia, India and China
 * Numerous deals to be signed
 By Ben Blanchard
 BEIJING, Aug 23 (Reuters) - South African President Jacob
Zuma, struggling with sluggish growth and worker discontent at
home, seeks to boost trade on Monday on a trip to China, the
last of the four ""BRIC"" economies he has visited in little over
a year since taking office..
 South Africa aims to tap trade and investment in ""BRIC""
economies Brazil, Russia, India and China to make up for the
downturn in traditional markets in weakly recovering Europe.
 ""There is a national consensus in South Africa that wants
the country to be part of the BRICs, and this visit to China is
part of achieving that goal,"" said Xu Weizhong, an Africa
expert at the China Institute of Contemporary International
Relations.
 ""South Africa also wants to be the bridge between Africa
and China,"" he added.
 For Beijing, the visit by Zuma will be an opportunity to
consolidate ties with African countries, where China is
increasingly turning for resources, markets and diplomatic
support.
 Late last year, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao offered Africa
$10 billion in concessional loans over three years.
 Yet with GDP growth forecast at 2.3 percent this year,
South Africa stacks up unfavourably against China and India,
and Zuma will be looking to narrow his country's trade deficit
with Beijing.
 ""South Africa wants Chinese investment, but at the same
time is worried about the competition this will bring. South
Africa is not well prepared for that,"" said Xu, the Chinese
expert.
 South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) is
soul-searching over development policies, in particular how to
boost the economy, which has failed to grow at the pace needed
to dent chronic unemployment.
 Many ANC officials are starting to see the fast growth of
China and other BRIC economies as proof that the state should
be doing more to nurture growth -- a departure from the
free-market orthodoxy that has prevailed since the end of
apartheid in 1994.
 While Zuma is in Beijing, China and South Africa are
expected to sign agreements that will include cooperation on
mineral resources and transport, and to address lopsided
bilateral trade flows.
 China is South Africa's largest trading partner, but last
year South Africa ran a $2.7 billion trade deficit with China.
 A Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement that Zuma
will sign is expected to address that, a South African
government spokesman said.
 ""This agreement is expected to deal with the trade
imbalance between the two countries and with the fact that
South Africa still exports raw materials to China while
importing finished products into our market,"" the government
spokesman, Themba Maseko, said ahead of the visit.
 Zuma will be shadowed by labour strains at home.
 More than one million public sector workers in South Africa
launched a strike last week, the latest in a wave of labour
protests to hit the country since May and has involved
teachers, police, health workers, customs officials and office
staff.
 A World Bank study published last week showed South African
unit labour costs in 2008 were higher than any other mainstream
emerging market apart from Morocco.

 * Australian dollar falls after inconclusive election
 * Euro vulnerable as Weber says ECB should extend easy policy
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar held steady on
Monday, retaining gains made late last week when growing worries
about the global economy prompted investors to park funds in the
world's most liquid currency, while the Australian dollar slid on
political uncertainty.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against six major currencies, was little changed at 83.073 after
hitting a one-month high of 83.304 on Friday. Resistance is seen
at 83.451, its July 21 high.
 The Australian dollar dropped after neither of the major
parties in Australia won an overall majority in Saturday's
election to form a government, leaving the country facing its
first hung parliament in 70 years.
 The euro was on the defensive, hovering near a five-week low
against the dollar and a seven-week trough against the yen, both
hit on Friday when European Central Bank Governing council member
Axel Weber said the ECB should extend its loose monetary stance,
stoking worries about the euro zone economy.
 ""The market's main focus has shifted back to the euro zone
from the U.S. economy's weakness,"" said a senior trader at a
Japanese brokerage. ""The dollar is supported by safe-haven
demand, managing to stay above a 15-year low against the yen.""
 Caution about possible intervention by Japanese authorities
to rein in the yen's strength is also making speculators hesitant
about selling the greenback against the yen, traders said.
 Investors were also keen to see if Bank of Japan Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa and Prime Minister Naoto Kan hold a meeting at
which markets were expecting Kan to pressure the central bank for
action in the face of the yen's strength.
 Jiji news agency said the government is considering
postponing the meeting, which had been expected to take place on
Monday, to avoid giving the impression that it is intervening in
the BOJ's policy decisions.
 In early Asian trade, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at
85.52 yen. The U.S. currency fell as low as 84.72 yen earlier
this month, its lowest since July 1995.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.2696, within sight of a
five-week trough of $1.2664 struck on trading platform EBS on
Friday. Support is seen at $1.2605, a 50 percent retracement of
its rise from a four-year low of $1.1876 hit in June to its
August peak of $1.3334.
 The single European currency slipped 0.3 percent to 108.63
yen, hovering near a seven-week low of 108.25 yen hit on EBS on
Friday.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $0.8882 after
sliding as low as $0.8833 in early Pacific trade, a one-month
trough.

 * Repairs possibly to last 48-72 hours

(Adds details, expected repair time)
 KIRKUK, Iraq, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The flow of oil through the
pipeline from Iraq's Kirkuk oilfields to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan was halted on Saturday morning, and repairs could last up
to 72 hours, sources at Iraq's North Oil Co said.
""We do not so far know the cause, whether it was a technical
glitch or sabotage,"" one source said, asking not to be
identified.
 The key energy corridor, which carries an average of 500,000
barrels per day, or around a quarter of Iraq's oil exports, has
been repeatedly targeted by suspected insurgents in recent
months or has suffered technical faults that halted pumping.
 The sources said repair crews had started work at dawn and
that it would probably take 48-72 hours to fix the pipeline.
 A bomb attack earlier this month blamed by Turkey on the
outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) halted the flow for two
days. Two people were killed in the explosion, which started a
fire.
 It was at least the second attack since July on the Turkish
side of the border blamed on the PKK since the group called off
a ceasefire.
 Bombings by insurgents on the Iraqi side of the border have
been far more common.
 Saturday's rupture occurred in volatile Nineveh province,
where Sunni Islamist al Qaeda retains a foothold despite a sharp
fall in violence in much of the rest of Iraq.
 The pipeline connects Iraq's northern oilfields around
Kirkuk to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, where the crude
is loaded onto tankers for export.
 Sabotage and technical problems kept the route mostly idle
until 2007 following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
The Kirkuk-Ceyhan link consists of two parallel pipelines.
Different pumping stations along the route allow pipeline
operators to switch the flow of crude to the alternative line,
Iraqi oil-industry sources have said.

 * AU says operations not affected
 (Adds company reaction, paragraph 7)
 By Dan Levine
 SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The CEO of the world's
fourth-largest maker of liquid crystal displays has been barred
by a federal judge from leaving the United States as Justice
Department officials pursue price-fixing allegations against
the company.
 A grand jury indicted Lai-Juh Chen, chief executive officer
of Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp <2409.TW> , in June for
fixing prices of thin-film LCD panels, which go into everything
from TVs to smartphones. The court ordered him to surrender his
passport this week. [ID:nN10251460]
 The U.S. Justice Department has accused AU Optronics
executives of participating in a group of industry officials
who met regularly in Taipei hotel rooms and restaurants to
discuss and agree on prices, from 2001 to 2006.
 Six companies had pleaded guilty in the subsequent probe,
including Taiwan's Chi Mei <3481.TW> and Chunghwa Picture Tubes
Ltd <2475.TW>, South Korea's LG Display <034220.KS> Co Ltd, and
Japan's Sharp Corp <6753.T>, Epson Imaging Devices, and Hitachi
Displays.
 After Chen pleaded not guilty in San Francisco last month,
his lawyers argued that as the case proceeds, he should be
allowed to travel between the United States and Asia to attend
important meetings.
 ""One such meeting is scheduled in September with top
officials of customer LG Electronics <066570.KS> in Korea,"" his
lawyers wrote. ""If Dr. Chen was unable to personally attend
these meetings as CEO, it would be more difficult for AU to
conclude agreement with customers or, potentially, it could
risk losing substantial business to competitors.""
 In Taiwan, an AU Optronics publicist said the firm's
business would see little impact from the case as many of
Chen's senior deputies remain on the island.
 U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered Chen and AU's
vice chairman, Hsuan Bin Chen, to surrender their passports
this week, court records indicate.
 ""Defendants shall not travel outside the Northern District
of California"" without the court's permission, Illston wrote.
The district stretches from San Jose in California north to the
Oregon border, and includes San Francisco.
 However, Illston quickly approved Chen's request to take a
brief domestic trip to Atlanta and Tennessee.

and former AU officials, along with the company itself. Another
one of those executives now barred from leaving the United
States is Hui Hsiung, CEO of Qisda Corp, a Taiwanese
manufacturer of electronics components including LCD monitors.
 A handful of representatives from the Taiwan government
attended Hsiung's court hearing to show support for his
international travel request, his attorney Brian Berson said.
 But prosecutors argued that Hsiung and the other AU
executives were flight risks, given the lack of an extradition
treaty between the United States and Taiwan.
 The United States switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei, capital of self-ruled Taiwan, to Beijing in 1979.
 Hsiung was disappointed with Illston's ruling, which may
force him to resign from Qisda, his lawyer said.
 So far, 17 executives have been charged in the LCD probe,
and the six companies that have pleaded guilty have paid fines
totaling more than $860 million. Many executives have pleaded
guilty, and their prison sentences usually last a few months.
 The AU personnel appear to be the first to declare their
innocence and fight the charges.
 AU said in July it saw no material impact on company
operations from the indictment, and, denying the charges,
pointed out that prices for thin-film LCD panels had fallen
steeply in past years. A U.S. lawyer for AU Optronics, a major
supplier to the likes of Dell Inc , Hewlett-Packard
 and Sony Corp <6758.T>, declined comment on Friday.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2010 07:56PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Countries want anti-counterfeit trade deal in Sept," * Talks have raised concerns among digital rights groups
 * Countries plan to resolve remaining issues in September
 * Japan to host next round of talks
(Adds details throughout)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Negotiators from the United
States, the European Union and nine other countries said on
Friday they planned to finish work in September on a proposed
pact to crack down on trade in counterfeit and pirated goods.
 The countries also pledged to publicly release the final
text of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which has
raised concerns among Internet and digital rights advocates,
""before deciding to sign it.""
 U.S. movie, music, software and other copyright-based
industries calculate that they lose more than $16 billion in
sales each year from pirated versions of their products sold
around the world. Many of these counterfeit and pirated goods
are made in China.
 In a joint statement, the participating countries addressed
a number of worries that have surfaced about the pact, saying
it would not require members of the agreement to take steps
that violate ""fundamental rights and liberties.""
 Some digital rights advocates feared that provisions aimed
at reducing online piracy of music and films could empower
Internet providers to deny service to repeat offenders.
 The trade agreement ""will not hinder the cross-border
transit of legitimate generic medicines,"" the joint statement
also said.
 The agreement ""will not oblige border authorities to search
travelers' baggage or their personal electronic devices for
infringing materials,"" it added.
 Some were concerned that the agreement might allow customs
officials to seize generic versions of patented drugs and to
confiscate laptops and music listening devices that contain
pirated material.
 Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand,
Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland also are taking part in
the talks. President Barack Obama has called the talks a key
element of the U.S. strategy for fighting the global trade in
fake goods, estimated at more than $200 billion annually.
 The agreement is expected to mandate that customs officials
in all the participating countries have authority to seize
counterfeit goods without a request from the right holders or a
court order.
 U.S. officials have said they do not expect the agreement
to require changes to U.S. law so it would not have to be
approved by Congress. However, that has only heightened
concerns about what the pact would require.
 One tough remaining issue is the 27-nation EU's demand that
the pact cover ""geographical indicators,"" which are names for
food and alcoholic products drawn from a particular location,
such Champagne or Cognac, both in France.
 But U.S. business groups worry that would mean U.S.
products as commonplace as Kraft Parmesan cheese could
potentially be treated as illegal items under the pact and
subject to seizure by customs officials.
 The United States believes that issue is resolvable by the
time negotiators hold their next round in Japan in late
September, said Nefeterius McPherson, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. Trade Representative's office.
 Participants in the negotiations agreed that Japan would
host the next negotiating round in September and that they are
committed to resolving the remaining substantive issues at that
time, officials said.
 Negotiators made progress this week in all areas of the
pact including general obligations, civil enforcement, border
measures, criminal enforcement and enforcement measures in the
digital environment, the group statement said.

 NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Lingering fears about economic
growth drove world stocks to a one-month low on Friday, while
boosting the safe-haven appeal of U.S. government bonds and the
U.S. dollar.
 The euro currency hit a more than five-week low near
$1.2660 after European Central Bank Governing Council member
Axel Weber said the ECB should extend its loose monetary
stance, raising fears of more economic weakness ahead in the
euro zone. For details, see [ID:nLDE67J0IR].
 Oil prices also fell more than 1 percent as investors
continued to worry about the poor U.S. jobs and manufacturing
numbers from Thursday.
 U.S. jobless claims hit a nine-month high and a U.S
regional manufacturing index showed the first contraction in a
year, reviving fears of a double-dip recession in the world's
largest economy.
 ""Basically growth is just not there,"" said Dave Rovelli, a
trader at Canaccord Adams in New York. ""Until this
administration figures out how to get people hired, we are
going to be seeing a lot of these big up days, big down days,
and the market's going to be all over the place.""

 In the U.S. Treasury bond market, yields on benchmark
10-year and 30-year Treasuries initially fell to their lowest
in nearly a year and a half. However, they rose later in the
session as investors braced for $109 billion supply of
coupon-bearing debt coming next week when the Treasury holds
its debt auctions.
 Also contributing to the pullback in the Treasuries market
was a late rebound in some U.S. tech shares, which helped key
U.S. stock indexes trim early losses.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 57.59
points, or 0.56 percent, at 10,213.62, while the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 3.94 points, or 0.37 percent, to
1,071.69. But the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> ended up 0.81
points, or 0.04 percent, at 2,179.76.
 ""No one's making a big bet either way, it's just short-term
moves and the net is, nothing is getting done."" said Ryan
Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment
Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.
 Exxon Mobil Corp , the largest stock in the S&P 500,
slid 0.67 percent as oil prices fell on concerns that a global
economic slowdown would reduce demand for the commodity.
 U.S. crude oil  ended down 97 cents, or 1.3 percent,
at $73.46 a barrel, the lowest since front-month prices ended
at $71.98 on July 6.
 The MSCI All-Country World equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
slid 0.99 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3>
closed 0.67 percent lower in its third straight session of
losses. Both indicators were at their lowest in one month.
 European construction stocks continued their slide from
Thursday's session when Holcim , the world's
second-biggest cement maker, posted disappointing first-half
earnings. Holcim, Saint-Gobain  and HeidelbergCement
 slipped 2.1 to 2.6 percent.
 DOLLAR GAINS
 The dollar saw a renewed safe-haven bid, reaching a
one-month high against a basket of major currencies measured by
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, which gained 0.68 percent.
 The greenback also gained 0.32 percent against the Japanese
yen  to 85.61.
 The euro was further pressured by comments from Bundesbank
chief Axel Weber, who said it would be ""wise"" to extend
unlimited liquidity to banks past the end of 2010 and resume
discussions to exit loose monetary conditions next year.
 The European single currency was 0.85 percent lower on the
day at $1.2711, after hitting its lowest point since mid-July,
according to Reuters data.
 Weber's ""comments simply confirm what many already expect
from the ECB, that the aggregate economy (despite recent solid
performance from Germany) is not yet prepared to be taken off
of monetary policy life support,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 As U.S. Treasuries prices fell late in the session, 2-year
notes  were down 1/32 in price, with the yield at
0.4952 percent. The 30-year bonds  fell 4/32 in
price, with the yield at 3.6593 percent.
 Earlier, two-year yields had fallen to a record low of 0.47
percent while those on 30-year bonds reached a 16-month low of
3.61 percent.

 TORONTO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slid to a
one-month low against the U.S. dollar on Friday as risk
appetite soured over revived fears of slowing global growth and
domestic inflation data came in below market expectations.
 Canadian consumer prices charged higher in July as new
sales taxes took effect in Ontario and British Columbia, but
underlying inflation remained tame, fueling doubts about how
fast the Bank of Canada would continue to raise interest rates
as the recovery loses steam. [ID:nN20500487]
 The currency  slid as low as C$1.0515 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.10 U.S. cents, its lowest level since July 20. It
closed at C$1.0488, or 95.35 U.S. cents, down from C$1.0399 to
the U.S. dollar or 96.16 U.S. cents on Thursday.
 ""The soft inflation numbers for Canada just added further
weight to the notion that the Bank of Canada would have to go
on hold on rates at some point soon and that's a negative for
the Canadian dollar,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at
CIBC World Markets.
 The consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in July,
following a 0.1 percent fall in June. Analysts in a Reuters
poll had forecast a 0.6 percent monthly rise for an annual rate
of 1.9 percent.
 Core CPI, which excludes volatile items and the effects of
tax changes, fell by 0.1 percent on the month after decreasing
by 0.1 percent in June.
 A poll conducted by Reuters after the data showed Canada's
primary securities dealers still predict the central bank will
raise interest rates for a third time this year in September,
but uninspiring economic data has cast doubt on the pace of
future increases. [ID:nN20198572]
 The Canadian dollar, however, was already weaker heading
into the inflation report, as investors dumped stocks,
commodities and commodity-linked currencies following
Thursday's poor U.S. jobs and manufacturing numbers.
[ID:nN19350083]
 As well, comments from Axel Weber, a member of the European
Central Bank's governing council, who said on Friday the ECB
should extend its loose monetary stance, were viewed as
suggesting more weakness ahead in the euro zone and fueled
investor worries. [ID:nLDE67J0IR]
 ""Weber's comments from the ECB, who we generally think of
as being a hawk -- he actually sounded fairly dovish -- so I
think that drove some euro weakness and then obviously the
inflation data for Canada kind of sealed it for a weak Canada
performance,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist
at Scotia Capital.
 The currency was down about 0.7 percent for the week even
though it rallied on Tuesday and Wednesday on the takeover bid
for Potash Corp by BHP Billiton. [ID:nSGE67J03V]
 Details of the offer released on Friday confirmed that
payments would be made in U.S. dollars, which would still
support the Canadian currency as a sizable amount could be
expected to be converted by Canadian shareholders.
 ""It's not what the denomination is of the initial check,
it's where the recipients reside and what currency they then
put the money,"" said CIBC's Shenfeld. ""It was only going to be
a proportion of the total purchase price in any event.""
 BONDS RALLY AFTER SOFT CPI
 Most government bond prices, especially at the short end of
the yield curve, jumped after the lower than expected inflation
data led investors to bet the Bank of Canada would pause in its
rate-hike campaign this year.
 ""Given that there was going to be a lot of volatility with
the HST (harmonized sales tax) in terms of this number, the
bond market really wasn't sure what to make of it,"" said David
Tulk, senior macro strategist at TD Securities.
 ""They certainly focused in on what core inflation was
showing because that was a lot less than what people had
expected, and the bond market saw cause to rally.""
 Canada's two-year bond  rose 13 Canadian cents to
yield 1.3 percent, while the 10-year bond  was up 7
Canadian cents to yield 2.913 percent.

 NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against
major currencies on Friday as heightened worries about the

the greenback for safety.

 Selling of the euro gained momentum after it below the

euro selling by central banks.
Technical analysts said the market was focusing on the
$1.2646 region, around the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the euro's slide from November 2009 to June 2010.
 US DOLLAR HOLDS ABOVE 85 YEN
 The U.S. dollar last traded up 0.4 percent at 85.66 yen
, helped by speculation that Japanese authorities may act
to stem the yen's rise. Risk aversion capped the dollar's gains
against the yen.
 Speculation is focused on additional easing measures by the
Bank of Japan, including expanding a funding scheme for
short-term loans.
 ""Markets are waiting for a meeting between the prime
minister and the Bank of Japan governor, which is feeding into
hopes that some easing measures may emerge,"" one London-based

 NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Investors dumped stocks on

 Yields on benchmark 10-year and 30-year Treasuries neared a

<.DXY>, which gained 0.87 percent.
 It erased earlier losses and gained 0.39 percent against
the Japanese yen  to 85.67.
 The euro was further pressured by comments from the
Bundesbank chief Axel Weber, who said it would be ""wise"" to
extend unlimited liquidity to banks past the end of 2010 and
resume discussions to exit loose monetary conditions next
year.
 The European single-currency was 1.08 percent lower on the
day at $1.2681, the lowest since mid-July, according to Reuters
data.
 Weber's ""comments simply confirm what many already expect
from the ECB, that the aggregate economy (despite recent solid
performance from Germany) is not yet prepared to be taken off
of monetary policy life support,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.

 By Niklas Pollard and Johan Ahlander
 HARPSUND, Sweden Aug 20 (Reuters) - Sweden raised its growth
forecast for this year and next on Friday, paving the way for
possible tax cuts by 2013, but said debt problems in other parts
of Europe might pose risks.
 The centre-right government, which is running neck-and-neck
with the opposition ahead of parliamentary elections next month,
forecast economic output would grow 4.5 percent this year, up
from the 3.3 percent it predicted in its outlook in July.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg said a broad upturn in the
economy pointed to healthy growth in the second half of the year
and stronger public finances, giving the government leeway for
potential fiscal stimulus measures worth up to $5.4 billion over
four years.
 But he also highlighted challenges ahead.
 ""At the same time as we make this optimistic scenario, our
assessment is that the risks are on the downside,"" Borg said in
a speech, pointing to public finance jitters elsewhere in
Europe.
 Borg told a news conference ahead of the government's annual
summer crayfish party that gross domestic product (GDP) was
expected to grow 4.0 percent in 2011 and 3.4 percent in 2012.
That compared with previous forecasts of 3.8 percent and 3.9
percent, respectively.
 Analysts said the forecast for 2011 looked a little
optimistic.
 ""This year, I don't think it will be hard to reach 4 percent
GDP growth, but it appears unrealistic to think that we would
reach 4 percent next year, not least in the context of the
global economic picture,"" Claes Mahlen, chief strategist at
Handelsbanken said.
 
 ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE?
 Sweden has bounced back from its worst downturn since World
War Two relatively quickly. Government finances are the
healthiest in Europe, consumer confidence is at the highest
level in a decade and industrial production has been picking up.
 Still, many say the strength of the recovery is still
uncertain.
 Fast-rising house prices and high levels of household debt
have some worried the country could be headed for a steep fall
in asset values while the export-heavy economy remains dependent
on developments abroad.
Borg saw Sweden's public finances improving faster than
expected, raising his forecast for the 2012 fiscal surplus to
1.1 percent of GDP from 0.7 percent.
 That would leave room for tax cuts and spending measures of
30 to 40 billion crowns ($4.0 to $5.4 billion) during the coming
four-year term, if the government was re-elected in September,
Borg said. That included 10 billion in reforms already earmarked
for next year.
 ""There is reason to carry out further reforms in 2011,"" Borg
said, pointing to high unemployment and low capacity
utilisation.
 He said current figures led him to believe any new tax cuts
by the centre-right coalition were likely to be carried out no
sooner than in 2013 and 2014 if targets for public finances were
to be met, a stated aim of the government.
 They were also likely to be considerably smaller during the
coming term than during the government's first term in office.
 Sweden's election race appears to be getting tighter just
one month ahead of the vote, with a poll on Friday showing the
opposition gaining ground on the centre-right government
alliance.
 Borg said the government felt it was reasonable to keep an
extra cushion in public finances, equal to one percent of gross
domestic product, in excess of the one percent already mandated
by the Nordic country's public surplus target during the coming
term.
 That would allow the government to keep its powder dry in
the face of a possible cyclical downturn.

 BRUSSELS, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The European Union is
investigating whether Chinese plastic bag manufacturers are
avoiding high EU import tariffs by channelling exports through a
single firm that is subject to lower duties.
 The European Commission, the EU's executive, said it had
evidence Chinese producers were exporting bags via a company
called Xiamen Xingxia Polymers Co. Ltd.
 The company is not subject to the same duties as other
Chinese companies because it was previously judged to be less
guilty of dumping, or exporting a product to the EU at a price
lower than the domestic one.
 ""The Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie
evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports ... are being
circumvented by means of reorganisation of patterns and channels
of sales,"" the Commission said in its official journal on
Friday.
 Xiamen Xingxia Polymers was not immediately available for
comment.
 The investigation is one of a series of moves by Brussels to
stop what it sees as unfair trading by Asian exporters.
 Chinese and Thai plastic bags entering the EU have been
subject to import duties of up to 28.8 percent for the past four
years, since the EU found exporters were dumping goods in the EU
market at illegally low prices.
 China exports an estimated 350 million euros' ($450 million)
worth of plastic sacks -- from shopping bags to bin liners -- to
the European Union annually.
 Xiamen Xingxia Polymers is one of about 100 exporters that
in 2006 were deemed to be less guilty of dumping and were
granted an 8.4 percent duty.
 The European Union now has until May 2011 to decide whether
Xiamen Xingxia is channeling plastic bags into the EU and to
levy higher duties against it.
 The investigation suggests plastic bag duties may be
extended by several years beyond their scheduled expiry in 2011,
according to a person familiar with the case.
 Such a move would anger retailers such as British
supermarket chains Tesco , Asda Stores and Sainsbury
 who want access to cheap Asian bags.

 NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The euro slumped broadly on
Friday due to risk aversion on concerns about the global
economy and comments by a senior ECB official that raised
expectations the central bank will keep monetary conditions
loose for some time.
 European Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Weber

 The comments added to investors' concerns about the
strength of the global economy despite massive stimulus
measures by governments to bolster a recovery.
 The single European currency fell as low as $1.2674 ,
its lowest since mid-July. Selling gained momentum after the
euro broke below the 50-day simple moving average around
$1.2730, with stop-loss sales triggered on a break of that
level, traders said. Some market participants cited the euro
being sold by central banks.

 Midway through the New York trading day, the euro was 1.1
percent lower on the day at $1.2678 , not far from the

 Technical analysts said the market was focusing on the
$1.2646 region, around the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the euro's slide from November 2009 to June 2010.
 The euro also fell against the yen to a 7-week low on
electronic trading platform EBS  before recovering
slightly to trade at 108.72 yen, still down 0.6 percent on the

 Risk aversion capped the dollar's gains against the yen,
but the U.S. currency traded above 85 yen  on speculation

 By Walter Brandimarte and Jeremy Gaunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Investors rushed into
safe-haven Treasuries, dumping stocks and eschewing the euro
on Friday as concerns about the global economic recovery
persisted for a second consecutive day.
 The euro dropped more than 1 percent against the dollar
after European Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Weber
said the ECB should extend its loose monetary stance,
suggesting fears of more economic weakness ahead in the euro
zone. For details, see [ID:nLDE67J0IR].
 Oil prices also fell more than 1 percent as investors, in
the absence of any major U.S. economic data, continued to worry
about Thursday's poor jobs and manufacturing numbers.
 U.S. jobless claims on Thursday hit a nine-month high and a
volatile U.S. regional manufacturing index showed the first
contraction in a year.
 These numbers have revived fears of a double-dip recession
in the world's largest economy and boosted demand for bonds.
 ""The market is falling on concerns about GDP growth going
forward,"" said Dean Tenerelli, fund manager at T Rowe Price.
""It's about the effect of a U.S. slowdown and uncertainty and
how earnings will look in 2011, when austerity kicks in.""
 The MSCI All-Country World equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>

Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 7.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to
1,068.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 10.48
points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,168.47.
 Oil prices fell on concerns that a global economic slowdown
would reduce demand for the commodity. U.S. crude oil 
was down 80 cents, or 1.07 percent, to $73.63 per barrel.
 FALLING EURO
 The euro fell against the dollar after Bundesbank chief
Axel Weber said it would be ""wise"" to extend unlimited
liquidity to banks past the end of 2010 and resume discussions
to exit loose monetary conditions next year.
 The euro was 1 percent lower on the day at $1.2686
according to Reuters data, its lowest since mid-July.
 ""The comments will lead the market to believe that
policymakers are expecting further economic weakness,"" said
Raghav Subbarao, currency analyst at Barclays Capital.
 ""Although a move towards active easing requires more bad
data, slowing growth will postpone any policy tightening.""
 The greenback also gained against the yen, reversing
earlier losses. It was up 0.43 percent against the Japanese
currency, at 85.71 yen .
 Bonds were benefiting from the mounting risk aversion, with
U.S. two-year yields  collapsing to a record low of

521,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2010 09:28AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-Wheat prices not yet a threat to inflation -FAO," * Wheat prices to remain high, volatile - FAO
 * Russian rains forecast through at least Aug. 22
 * Russia says emphatically no plans to import grains
 * Countries like India may see some food price inflation
 
 (Wraps pieces on FAO, market reports, stories from Russia
and Ukraine)
 By Svetlana Kovalyova
 MILAN, Aug 20 (Reuters) - World wheat price rises are not
yet sufficient to trigger global food inflation, an economist at
the UN Food and Agricultural Organization said on Friday, even
though they almost doubled in the space of two months.
 A drought and heat wave in the Black Sea region, although
declared to be over in Russia earlier this week, is estimated to
have destroyed a quarter of its grain crop and led to a ban on
exports. Ukraine is also ready to impose export quotas, which
traders have criticised as overly restrictive.
 FAO economist and cereals analyst Abdolreza Abbassian told
Reuters in a telephone interview that he expected wheat prices
to remain high and volatile in the coming months but that they
did not pose a threat of global inflation.
 ""To talk about food inflation when the bulk of the increase
is in wheat is a bit too early,"" he said.
 Earlier this month, wheat futures in Chicago rose to the
highest levels in about two years, peaking at $8.41 a bushel
after a two-month rally fuelled by the Russian drought.
 They have subsequently fallen back below $7.00 a bushel on
the front month as high global stocks also helped cap the rally
and keep prices far below the peak of $13.34-1/2 set in February
2008.
 Buyers such as Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer,
also are turning to the United States, which has ample capacity.
 Prices were bolstered on Thursday by analysts' and traders'
comments that Russia might become a significant importer of
wheat this season.
 But a spokesman for the Agricultural Ministry told RIA news
agency on Friday that the country had no plans to import grain
this year. ""This rumour is being spread by dishonest grain
traders in order to heat up the market,"" he said.
 
 CHANGES IN OUTPUT FORECASTS
 On Friday, Abbassian estimated that wheat output in Russia
was likely to fall by about 20 million tonnes to 42-43 million
tonnes this year.
 He had said on Thursday the FAO was set to cut its 2010
world wheat output outlook by 5-7 million tonnes and trim its
global wheat stocks estimate by a couple of million tonnes to
take into account Russia's shortfalls.
 FAO's food price index, a measure of monthly changes in
international prices of a basket of food commodities, in August
is set to exceed July's five-month high and is likely to keep
rising in the next two to three months, he said.
 The index rise in August will be driven by cereals, sugar
and vegetable oils and fats, he said.
 It rose to a 165.5 reading in July, its highest since
February, but it was still far away from its peak reading of
213.5 in June 2008, in the middle of the global food crisis
which triggered food riots in developing countries.
 Countries such as India where food accounts for a large
part of the inflation index could indeed see a risk of food
inflation, Abbassian added.
 Moreover, if bad weather continues in Russia and hits other
major producers in the northern hemisphere as they prepare for
their winter plantings campaign, then next season's global wheat
supplies could be at risk, he said.
 But that possibility is ""very small"" at present, because
weather conditions appear to be improving in Russia, he said.
 Surging wheat prices are likely to prompt farmers around the
globe to sow more wheat for the next season, creating the
theoretical possibility of a glut, he added.
 Rains started in Russia on Tuesday and are forecast to
continue through at least Aug. 22 in most parts of the country,
the Hydrometcentre weather forecasting service said on Friday.
 Large-scale winter grain sowing, which normally starts in
August, is unlikely until Sept. 10, it said.
 A senior Ukraine Agriculture Ministry official said,
meanwhile, that the government was open to adjusting export
quotas after talks with traders and depending on market
conditions. The quotas are due to be finalised at a government
meeting on Aug. 25.

 * Deal reached in auto workers' strike
(Updates with results from talks, adds minister)
 By Jon Herskovitz and Marius Bosch
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - South Africa's government
offered no new deal in talks on Friday to end a strike by about
1 million civil servants that now looks set to stretch into next
week, a union spokesman said.
 The state workers' strike started on Wednesday -- the latest
in a wave of labour protests since May -- and quickly turned
violent, with police firing rubber bullets to disperse
protesters blocking roads and preventing patients from entering
hospitals.
 ""There was no new offer,"" Chris Kloppers, spokesman for the
Independent Labour Caucus, said after talks with the government.
A public service ministry spokesman would not comment on the
discussions.
 Any agreement will likely swell state spending by about 1 to
2 percent, forcing the South African government to find funds to
pay for the deal as it tries to bring its deficit down from 6.7
percent of gross domestic product.
 The government has repeatedly said it cannot afford the more
than double inflation wage increase demand from public sector
unions. The central bank has warned that a series of above
inflation increases so far could fan inflation.
 The public services minister told union officials the
government wants to use the courts to prevent strikers from
attacking and harassing those at places of work after reports of
students being assaulted by teachers and doctors blocked from
entering clinics, Kloppers said.
 Civil servants' unions have taken hits in public opinion
after hospital managers attributed several deaths at clinics to
the strike and domestic media reported a man with a severed hand
being refused treatment at public hospitals because there was no
one who could care for him.
 South Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi joined
thousands who volunteered at hospitals to care for the sick and
offered harsh words to strikers who were intimidating workers
and preventing treatment.
 ""There are rules of engagement and one of the rules in
respect of health services is when you refuse to let others work
when you are striking, that is murder,"" Motsoaledi said.
 On Friday, metalworkers' union Numsa said 70,000 of its
members in the automotive components, vehicle repair and fuel
retail industries would strike from Aug. 30 after hitting
deadlock with employers over its demand for a 15 percent pay
increase. Employers have offered 6.6 percent.

 TRADERS CONCERNED
 Analysts see a deal to end the state workers' strike coming
before September, which would limit the damage of the walk-out
by police, teachers, healthcare workers, customs officers and
government clerks.
 Thousands of municipal workers have also threatened to go on
what they called a ""sympathy strike"", which may not affect the
economy but could hit services such as street sweeping, rubbish
collection and vehicle licensing.
 Traders say the strike has not hit daily activity in the
rand or bonds but they are worried about a labour stoppage that
extends into September.
 ""It just slows down business in general because lots of
businesses rely on state entities to get their funds,"" said Ion
de Vleeschauwer, chief dealer at Bidvest Bank.
 ""It might not be evident now, but a couple of months down
the line we will see the effect of the slowdown in economic
activity affecting us,"" he said.
 Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Thursday he did not
see a protracted strike as having a major economic impact.
 State workers' unions are demanding an 8.6 percent pay rise
and 1,000 rand ($137) a month for housing.
 Last week the government raised the housing allowance to 700
rand from a previous offer of 630 rand, but refused to increase
its wage rise offer of 7 percent. Annual inflation stands at 4.2
percent.
 The housing allowance alone would be equal to about 1
percent of all budget spending and the government has said it
does not have the money to pay more.
 Autoworkers and car manufacturers on Friday reached a wage
deal to end an eight-day strike which led to lost production of
about 17,000 vehicles, employers body AMEO said.
 Around half of South Africa's annual production of vehicles
is exported to other African states, Europe and North America.
 The Automobile Manufacturers Employers Organisation said it
and union Numsa signed a 3-year wage agreement which will see
workers getting a 10 percent increase this year, and 9 percent
in each of the next two years.

 * Move faces opposition within EU and from India, WTO
 * Supporters say deal is a strategic imperative
 
 By David Brunnstrom and Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The EU foreign affairs chief
will urge EU states next month to back trade concessions for
Pakistan as worries grow about the impact of devastating floods
on the stability of its fragile government. 
 EU diplomats say support for such trade breaks appears to be
growing, given Pakistan's strategic importance in the struggle
against Islamist militancy, although they have been opposed by
industry groups and EU states with competing textile industries.
 Top EU diplomat Catherine Ashton will push the issue again
at a Sept. 10-11 meeting of EU foreign ministers -- three months
after a summit with Pakistan ruled out immediate concessions.
 ""The international community needs to be ready to support
Pakistan in a lasting manner,"" Ashton said this week. ""This will
be a significant element for the long-term recovery.
 ""A safe, secure, stable and prosperous Pakistan is in the
interests of the EU and the wider international community.""
 Concerns have grown about the stability of President Asif
Ali Zardari's government after criticism of his response to the
worst floods in Pakistan's history.
 Representatives of Pakistan's key textile sector said this
week that damage to the cotton crop and consequent supply
shortages could be a final blow to an industry already suffering
from shrinking global demand, crippling power shortages and
instability brought on by a Taliban insurgency.
 According to EU data, Pakistan's exports to the European
Union in 2009 totalled 3.02 billion euros ($3.86 billion), or
21.9 percent of its total exports.
 
 IMPORT TARIFFS
 Some products from Pakistan already enter the EU duty-free
or at reduced rates, but textiles such as bed linen and towels
-- more than 65 percent of Pakistan's exports to the EU -- are
still subject to a 12 percent tariff.
 Pakistan wants better access through the EU's Generalised
System of Preferences-Plus (GSP+) regime - offered to developing
states that commit to rights and good-governance conventions.
 Pakistan has not qualified for this as its exports to the EU
are too large and the EU remains concerned about its reluctance
to implement human rights and other conventions.
 However, a European Commission review of GSP rules could
increase the number of eligible states to include Pakistan and
those of similar economic ranking.
 The Commission proposals are due early next year, for entry
into force in 2012 or 2013, but Ashton is looking to speed up
the process, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.
 EU diplomats say there is resistance from EU states such as
Italy, Poland and Portugal, which see their own textile
industries threatened.
 They say a powerful opponent to any quick move has been the
European Commission president, Portugal's Jose-Manuel Barroso,
who in June reaffirmed a timeframe of up to three years.
 European textile lobby Euratex warned in May that expanding
GSP+ would ""inflict a severe blow"" to the EU industry. EU states
in favour of concessions argue that the effect is overstated.
 
 UNILATERAL WAIVER?
 Diplomats said that if it proved impossible to ease GSP
rules, another option could be to waive duties unilaterally, as
was done after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in recognition of
Pakistan's status as a key ally in the war in Afghanistan.
 However, Pakistan's neighbour and rival India successfully
challenged this step as a violation of World Trade Organisation
rules, forcing Brussels to withdraw the concession.
 EU diplomats said it was too early to judge how the EU
debate would evolve, but that there was a growing realisation
that something significant needed to be done to help Pakistan.
 ""You have to decide you have the political will to do
something, then create a mechanism robust enough to fit WTO
rules,"" one said. ""There are various ways that can be done.""
 If there is strong enough political will from EU capitals,
the EU could amend the relevant part of the GSP ""in a few weeks
or months"", a senior EU trade official said. But with
conflicting interests dividing each of the main European
institutions, any quick change will be hard to pull off.
 Countries including Britain and Sweden have pushed the issue
strongly with growing German and French support, diplomats said.
 ""The question is what is done, and over what timelines,"" the
diplomat said. ""The floods have increased the urgency, and the
political imperative to act is different than a few months ago.
 ""You have vast parts of Pakistan affected by floods; it's
immensely strategically significant and the situation will sadly
get worse and worse. There's a real need to demonstrate the
international community as a whole can react.""

525,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2010 08:40AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Resilience in the euro zone," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Some investors who have heavily
underweighted euro zone assets may have more reasons to change
their mind in the coming week as the resilience of the region's
economy contrasts with persistent hints of a U.S. double dip.
 Given a surprisingly robust economic performance, especially
in Germany, investors are becoming more sanguine about the
single currency region's sovereign debt troubles -- once the
biggest drag for investors in euro zone stocks and other assets.
 Concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing, or possibly
returning to a recession, has affected other markets, as seen in
Friday's fall in Asian and European stocks.
 But long-term asset managers are looking beyond knee-jerk
reactions and evaluating the risk of being overly underweight in
assets from a region starting to look less ugly than its U.S.
counterpart.
 By way of example, mainstream fund managers polled by Bank
of America Merrill Lynch this month have become overweight euro
zone equities for the first time since November.
 More leading indicators on the euro zone manufacturing
sector and German business morale, due in the coming week, could
accelerate this trend, at a time when investors are increasingly
worried about the U.S. economy's worsening prospects.
 Prudential International Investment Advisors upgraded the
euro zone to modest overweight while cutting the United States
to underweight.
 ""Solid growth momentum in the core euro zone is likely to
offset weakness in the periphery. Earnings are expected to be
solid around 31 percent (growth) in 2010,"" noted John Praveen,
chief investment strategist at Prudential.
 ""The U.S. is unlikely to outperform other markets.""
 This year's earnings growth for major U.S. firms on the S&P
500 index is expected at 35.8 percent, according to Thomson
Reuters data, but many analysts warn of downgrade risks.
 The BofA Merrill poll found that fund managers are now
underweight in the United States, with a net 49 percent of
respondents in Europe saying local equities are undervalued.
Year to date, European stocks, measured by the FTSEuro 300
index, have fallen around 1 percent, outperforming the S&P 500
index which dropped 3.5 percent and the MSCI world equity index
which lost nearly 5 percent.
 In the credit market however, euro zone assets have a lot of
catching up to do, especially in the high-yield space.
 Total return on euro high-yield corporate paper, rated BB,
stood at 4.3 percent, according to BofA Merrill data. This
compares with 5 percent for similarly-rated U.S. bonds.
 
 RATES VS RISK APPETITE
 In the foreign exchange market, the euro is down nearly 9
percent on a trade-weighted basis while the dollar has risen 6
percent against a basket of major currencies.
 ""The euro has stabilised over the past week, and... it does
appear that fundamental drivers, rather than positioning, will
drive the next major move,"" Deutsche Bank said in a note to
clients.
 Investors have been pushing back the timing of the next
interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve after the central bank
decided earlier this month to buy more government debt with the
cash from maturing mortgage bonds. They expect the Fed to leave
interest rates on hold until mid-2011.
 The U.S. two-year note yield hit an all-time low of 0.472
percent on Friday while the benchmark 10-year yield set a fresh
17-month trough of 2.550 percent.
 Spreads between the U.S. and euro zone 10-year yields have
fallen to around 26 basis points, near the lowest level this
year, compared with an April high of 91 bps.
 ""Recent correlations suggest that rate spreads are becoming
more important, overtaking risk appetite, while the sensitivity
to peripheral euro area concerns are waning. On balance,
we would expect such a shift to favour gains in the euro,""
Deutsche said.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2010 08:32AM ET</span>",ECB FOCUS-South's cash addiction to force continuing ECB drip," * Southern European banks increasingly reliant on ECB funds
 * Problems to lead ECB keeping unlimited lending in place
 * Bank stress tests provided only short-term help
 * Two-speed recovery complicates ECB's task
 
 By Sakari Suoninen
 FRANKFURT, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
have little option but to keep flooding the money market with
cash to aid banks and governments in the common currency area's
troubled southern periphery, despite robust growth in the core.
 Southern Europe has been hit hard on several fronts
recently. First the sovereign debt crisis hit Greece and other
southern periphery countries, then bank stress tests showed 6
out of 7 failing banks were in Spain or Greece, and then the
region posted only tepid growth while most of the euro zone was
humming along nicely, all weakening confidence in banks.
 Bank borrowing from the ECB shows increasing strains in
southern euro-zone's financial sector while banks elsewhere are
getting back on their feet, but the fear of contagion from
country to country will keep the ECB on its toes.
 Total use of ECB funds has dipped in recent months, but
southern periphery banks rely on the ECB in the face of
continued reluctance among peers to lend. 
 Analysts said this would reinforce the argument for the ECB
to extend its unlimited cash offers into next year -- an outcome
looking increasingly likely after Germany's Axel Weber joined
other policymakers in backing an extension on Friday.
 Banks in Greece borrowed twice as much last month as they
did in July 2009, even though outstanding central bank lending
fell 18 percent over the same time. Banks in Portugal borrowed
five times as much in July 2010 as they did a year earlier, and
borrowing also rose in Spain and Italy.
 ""The full-allotment fixed-rate repos will stay well into
next year,"" said Michala Marcussen, Societe General chief
economist.
 ""Beyond the first quarter of next year, the overall economic
environment will be the key determinant in how much longer it
gets carried. In all likelihood it could get carried further
ahead.""
 
 STRESSED
 The ECB introduced unlimited fixed-rate loans in October
2008 and has promised to keep them in place in the shorter-term,
one week and one month operations until at least mid-October,
and until the end of September for three-month money.
Fourth-quarter plans are due to be revealed in September.
 The ECB tried to reintroduce limits to borrowing in April
but was forced into a U-turn by the sovereign debt crisis,
returning to its full allotment policy in May.
 Cyprus's Athanasios Orphanides and Ireland's Patrick Honohan
have indicated the unlimited funding should continue. But Weber
made clear exit discussions should not resume until early next
year and his dovish tone got analysts' attention.
 ""The key message is that the ECB is willing to stay there as
long as it has to and that it believes that it needs to be
present and keep those full allotments,"" Marcussen said.
 There were great hopes that last month's bank stress tests,
the latest salvo in the battle to improve confidence, would calm
the market but their impact is already waning after muted
positive signals at first.
 ""There has to be increased confidence of health or the
perceived health of the banking system (for phasing out crisis
measures),"" said RBS economist Nick Matthews. 
 ""The stress tests were an opportunity to do that, but it
does seem as though some of the positive results seem to be
wearing off, so maybe these stress tests were a missed
opportunity.""
 Only seven of the 91 banks tested failed, and some analysts
thought the scenarios were too lenient.
 
 PREVENTING SPILLOVER 
 The euro zone is seeing an increasing split not only in
banking, but in the economy as a whole, further complicating the
ECB's task. While the euro-zone economy boomed in the second
quarter with Germany setting the tone, southern Europe recorded
much more muted growth.
 The ECB stresses consistently its policy takes into account
the whole of the euro zone, not individual countries.
 ""I think it is a challenge that we had to face permanently
since the very beginning of the euro,"" Trichet said earlier this
month, brushing off concerns that uneven economic development
was an especially pressing problem right now.
 But neglecting banks' difficulties even in relatively small
countries would exacerbate the economic split and threaten to
get the south mired in a credit crunch.
 Moreover, the Greek debt crisis showed that developments in
one small country can have dramatic implications for others, and
banks are dependent on each other across borders.
 ""Because of the interlinkages between the European banking
systems, if there are issues in one country, these will domino
into other countries,"" SocGen's Marcussen said.
 ""It is not just about supporting the peripheral countries,
it it about offering support to the European banking sector.""
 The ECB's promise of continued unlimited funding would
reduce uncertainties and give banks and governments time to
bridge their credibility gap.
 Liquidity injections have an important role not only in
helping banks, but also in easing government financing woes, as
sovereign bonds can be used as collateral against ECB loans,
making them more attractive to banks, analysts said.
 ""The ECB is not just financing the banks that obtain funds
more cheaply, it is also financing the governments (through the
tenders)"", said Filipe Garcia, an economist at the Informacao de
Mercados Financeiros in Porto, Portugal.
 The central bank would not be doing its job as guardian of
the economy were it to ignore problems in the south, he added.
 ""If the ECB was not present, it would not be assuming its
role as a central bank,"" Garcia said.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Investors dumped risky assets on
Friday and fled into bonds and safe-haven assets including the
Japanese yen amid growing concerns about slackening economic
growth.
 European stocks fell one percent and U.S. stock futures
pointed to a weak open in New York after a slew of poor jobs and
sentiment numbers drove Wall Street to its lowest close in
almost a month on Thursday.
 The euro fell one percent after European Central Bank
Governing Council member Axel Weber bolstered the view monetary
policy would remain loose for months, adding to fears that more
economic weakness lies ahead in the euro zone too.
 The yen, a popular safe haven, approached a 15-year high
against the dollar, the Swiss franc rose and the steep declines
in U.S. bond yields gathered pace.
 U.S. jobless claims on Thursday hit a nine-month high and a
volatile U.S. regional manufacturing index showed the first
contraction in a year.
 These numbers have revived fears of a double-dip recession
in the world's largest economy and boosted demand for bonds.
 ""The market is falling on concerns about GDP growth going
forward,"" said Dean Tenerelli, fund manager at T Rowe Price.
 ""It's about the effect of a U.S. slowdown and uncertainty
and how earnings will look in 2011, when austerity kicks in.""
 World stocks as measured by MSCI and Thomson Reuters were
down almost one percent to three-week lows. The pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1 percent.
 Lower global oil prices have undermined key energy stocks.
The STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas index was off 0.2 percent as oil
prices fell $1 a barrel.
 U.S. futures for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down
between 0.6 and 0.7 percent,
 The weakness in Europe and the United States carries on from
Asia where Japan's Nikkei average fell 2 percent, hit by the
U.S. economic worries, but also by jitters over what steps
Japanese authorities might take to stem the recent yen rise.
 Markets are rife with speculation that the Bank of Japan may
loosen its already-easy monetary policy at an emergency meeting
next week.
 
 RISING YEN
 The dollar has been buttressed by safe-haven demand after
the U.S. data, helping it stay above a 15-year trough against
the yen. It was unchanged at 85.39 yen, hovering above 84.72 yen
hit last week for the first time since 1995.
 The greenback hovered near seven-month lows against another
safe haven asset, the Swiss franc.
 But the euro fell after Bundesbank chief Axel Weber said it
would be ""wise"" to extend unlimited liquidity to banks past the
end of 2010 and resume discussions to exit loose monetary
conditions next year. 
 The euro was 1 percent lower on the day at $1.2686 according
to Reuters data, its lowest since mid-July.
 ""The comments will lead the market to believe that
policymakers are expecting further economic weakness,"" said
Raghav Subbarao, currency analyst at Barclays Capital.
 ""Although a move towards active easing requires more bad
data, slowing growth will postpone any policy tightening."" 
 Bonds were benefiting from the mounting risk aversion, with
U.S. two-year yields collapsing to a record low of 0.459 percent
while 30-year yields fell to 3.598 percent -- a low not seen
since April 2009.
 ""It's more flight to quality,"" a bond trader in London said.
""If you're short this market, you're in a world of pain. It's
pretty much that simple.""

 LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Friday
as comments by a senior European Central Bank official fuelled
expectations for liquidity to remain ample and investors sold
riskier assets on concerns of economic slowdown.

told Bloomberg in an interview published on Friday it would be
""wise"" to extend unlimited liquidity to banks past the end of
2010. [ID:nWEA4983]
 The single currency fell to $1.2686 , its lowest since
mid-July. Selling gained momentum after the euro broke key
technical levels around $1.2730, with stop-loss sales triggered
on a break of that level, traders said. Some market participants
cited the euro being sold by central banks.
European stocks fell 1.0 percent at one point, as investors
pared back on riskier assets.
 ""It's all moving in the same direction,"" said Ian Stannard,
senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas. ""The situation is
turning to one where weak U.S. data is becoming a positive for
the dollar as a U.S. slowdown is seen affecting a broader global
economic recovery.""
 By 1120 GMT, the euro was 0.9 percent lower on the day at
$1.2706 . Technical analysts said the market was focusing
on the $1.2646 region, around the 23.6 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the euro's slide in November 2009-June 2010.
 The euro also fell more than 1.0 percent against the yen to
a 7-week low of 108.25 yen  and towards its record low
against the Swiss franc, dropping 0.6 percent to 1.3141 francs
.
 
 DOLLAR HOLDS ABOVE 85 YEN
 The dollar was a clear gainer, hitting a one-month high
against a currency basket at 83.161 <.DXY>.
 It remained under pressure against the yen but managed to
hold above 85 yen  on speculation that Japanese
authorities may take steps to stem the yen's rise.
 Speculation is focused on additional easing measures by the
Bank of Japan, including expanding a funding scheme for
short-term loans.
 ""Markets are waiting for a meeting between the prime
minister and the Bank of Japan governor, which is feeding into
hopes that some easing measures may emerge,"" one London-based
trader said.
 The dollar had dipped below 85 yen on Thursday after a spate
of weak U.S. data that showed a rise in new U.S. jobless claims
while a mid-Atlantic manufacturing index fell this month for the
first time in more than a year. [ID:nN19350083]

 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Unions representing
striking South African civil servants plan talks with the
government on Friday as investors worry about the damage of a
prolonged walk-out on Africa's largest economy.
 The strike by more than 1 million state workers seeking
higher wages started on Wednesday -- the latest in a wave of
labour protests to hit the country since May.
 The latest strike turned violent on its second day with
police firing rubber bullets to disperse protesters blocking
busy roads and preventing patients from entering hospitals.
 Any agreement will likely swell state spending by about 1 to
2 percent, forcing the government to find funds to pay for the
deal as it tries to bring its deficit down from 6.7 percent of
gross domestic product.
 Chris Klopper, a spokesman for the Independent Labour Caucus
union federation, expects the government to repeat a threat to
unilaterally impose its wage raise offer and not to bring any
new deal to the table.
""Hopefully the discussions will be more positive than that,""
he said.
 The public sector strike is likely to stretch into next week
but analysts see a deal coming before September, which would
limit the damage of the walk-out by police, teachers, healthcare
workers, customs officers and government clerks.
 Traders say the strike has not hit daily activity in the
rand or bonds but they are worried about a labour stoppage that
extends into September.
 ""It just slows down business in general because lots of
businesses rely on state entities to get their funds,"" said Ion
de Vleeschauwer, chief dealer at Bidvest Bank.
 ""It might not be evident now, but a couple of months down
the line we will see the effect of the slowdown in economic
activity affecting us,"" he said.
 Autoworkers and car manufacturers on Friday reached a wage
deal to end an eight-day strike which led to lost production of
about 17,000 vehicles, employers body AMEO said.
 Around half of South Africa's annual production of vehicles
is exported to other African states, Europe and North America.
 The Automobile Manufacturers Employers Organisation said it
and union Numsa signed a 3-year wage agreement which will see
workers getting a 10 percent increase this year, and 9 percent
in each of the next two years.
 Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Friday he did not
see even a protracted strike as having a major economic impact.
 Unions are demanding an 8.6 percent pay rise, more than
double the inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($137) a month for
housing.
 Last week the government raised the housing allowance to 700
rand from a previous offer of 630 rand, but refused to increase
its wage rise offer of 7 percent. Annual inflation now stands at
4.2 percent.
 The housing allowance alone would be equal to about 1
percent of all budget spending and the government has said it
does not have the money to pay more.
 The unions have taken hits in public opinion after hospital
managers attributed several deaths at clinics to the strike and
domestic media reported a man with a severed hand being refused
treatment at public hospitals because there was no one who could
care for him.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell to its lowest
against the dollar in more than a month on Friday after comments
by a European Central Bank official bolstered the view that euro
zone monetary policy would remain loose for months to come.
 ECB Governing Council member Axel Weber told Bloomberg news
agency that it would be ""wise"" to extend unlimited liquidity to
banks past the end of 2010 and resume discussions to exit loose
monetary conditions next year.
 The comments came after St. Louis Federal Reserve President
James Bullard on Thursday said the U.S. central bank may need to
ramp up purchases of U.S. Treasuries if price levels in the U.S.
economy continue to shows signs of softening.
 Analysts said that dovish comments from central banks were
adding to an increasingly sombre economic outlook, which would
keep risk aversion high.
 ""The comments will lead the market to believe that
policymakers are expecting further economic weakness,"" said
Raghav Subbarao, currency analyst at Barclays Capital.
 ""Although a move towards active easing requires more bad
data, slowing growth will postpone any policy tightening.""
 He added that this view would continue to make investors
reluctant to take on significant positions in risky assets, and
may push the euro lower. The safe-haven dollar often appreciates
during times of risk aversion.
 Weakness in the U.S. economy was highlighted by data on
Thursday showing a rise in new U.S. jobless claims while a
mid-Atlantic manufacturing index fell this month for the first
time in more than a year.
 By 1028 GMT, the euro had fallen 1 percent on the day to
$1.2686 according to Reuters data, its lowest since mid-July.
 Some market participants cited euro selling by central banks
as pushing the single currency lower, while stop-loss orders
were triggered just below $1.2730.
 Technical analysts said the market was focusing on the
$1.2646 region, around the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of
the euro's slide in November 2009-June 2010.
 Losses in the euro helped pushed the dollar up 0.7 percent
against a currency basket to a one-month high of 83.161
 
 DOLLAR HOLDS ABOVE 85 YEN
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent versus the Swiss franc to 1.0355
francs, but it hovered near a seven-month low of 1.0254 hit on
Thursday. The safe-haven franc has gained broadly in the past
week or so, indicating investors remain risk averse.
 The dollar's broad gains failed to boost it against the yen.
It was unchanged at 85.40 yen, hovering in range of 84.72 yen
hit last week for the first time since 1995.
 The U.S. currency has taken a hit versus the yen in past
weeks as U.S. Treasury yields have tumbled due to concerns about
the U.S. economy, narrowing their spread with Japanese
government bonds and tarnishing their appeal.
 Dollar/yen movements were at a standstill, with investors
wary of extending the yen's recent gains before an expected
meeting between Japan's prime minister and central bank
governor.
 Some in the market suspect they may discuss ways to prevent
the yen from climbing further. Japan's finance minister on
Friday said he was communicating with other Group of Seven
nations on currencies.
 ""Everyone thinks the dollar will extend losses against the
yen,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the foreign
securities department at Okasan Securities in Tokyo.
 ""But fears of intervention and caution about additional
monetary easing steps in Japan are making players hesitate to
aggressively sell the dollar for now.""
 The high-yielding Australian dollar fell nearly 1.0 percent
to a one-month low of $0.8846. Australia holds a general
election on Saturday, and polls showed the ruling Labor Party
was neck-and-neck with the conservative opposition.

 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 20 (Reuters) - South African automobile
manufacturers and a union representing thousands of auto workers
have reached a deal on wages, ending a costly eight-day strike,
employers' body AMEO said on Friday.
 The Automobile Manufacturers Employers Organisation said it
and union Numsa signed a wage agreement on Friday. The
three-year deal will see workers getting a 10 percent increase
this year, and 9 percent in the next two years.
 The unions were seeking 15 percent wage hikes, more than

 The strike led to lost production of about 17,000 vehicles,
the group said. South Africa's auto industry, which the industry
said accounts for about 6 percent to 7 percent of the country's
GDP, produces about 420,000 vehicles a year. 
 About half of South Africa's auto production is exported to
other African states, Europe and North America.
 The strike hit companies including Toyota, Ford, Volkswagen

 The strike has not stood out in the global context because

managers attributed several deaths at clinics to the strike and
domestic media reported a man with a severed hand being refused
treatment at public hospitals because there was no one who could
care for him.
 Separately, automobile manufacturers and a union
representing thousands of auto workers have reached a deal on
wages, ending a costly eight-day strike in the country's car
industry, employers' body AMEO said on Friday.
 The Automobile Manufacturers Employers Organisation said it
and union Numsa signed a wage agreement. The 3-year deal will
see workers getting a 10 percent increase this year, and 9
percent in the next two years.

 * Some investors still uneasy about Ireland govt debt burden
(Adds quotes, background, changes slug/keywords)
 TOKYO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Irish government debt spreads over
German sovereign debt are still uncomfortably high but the cost
of bailing out the country's ailing lenders will not increase
debt to an unmanageable level, the governor of Ireland's central
bank said.
 ""Spreads are still higher than I would like to see,"" Patrick
Honohan told reporters in Tokyo on Friday when asked about the
results of an Irish debt auction this week.
 ""The big picture is estimates of our net fiscal cost (for the
banking sector) is still manageable. These percentages don't lift
the path of government debt into an unmanageable range,"" said
Honohan, who is also a member of the European Central Bank's
governing council.
 Irish and Spanish debt auctions attracted strong demand on
Tuesday, allaying concerns about the pressure on costs of funding
for euro zone countries saddled with high debt in the wake of
Greece's sovereign debt crisis.
 But some investors are still on edge over the cost Dublin
faces in bailing out its lenders after it emerged last week that
the government may need to pump more capital into nationalised
Anglo Irish Bank than previously expected.
 Honohan reiterated comments he made earlier this week that
the net cost to the Irish government of helping Anglo Irish Bank
may be about 22 to 25 billion euros ($28-32 billion).
 He also said this week that the cost of bailing out state-run
Irish Nationwide (INBS) home loan company could rise from the 2.7
billion euros already promised to it.

 LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Investors steered clear of
riskier assets on Friday amid growing concerns about slackening
growth in the U.S. economy.
 Globally, equities were lower, with Europe giving up early
gains. The Japanese yen, a popular safe haven, threatened to hit
a 15-year high against the dollar.
 Reports on Thursday showed U.S. jobless claims at a
nine-month high and the first contraction in a year in a

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The euro steadied against the
dollar on Friday, recovering from the day's low as weak U.S.
economic data added to speculation that the euro zone economy
may recover faster than the United States.
 Slight gains in European stocks also supported the euro but
currencies were little changed, and the dollar was buttressed by
safe-haven demand after a jump in U.S. jobless claims and weak
manufacturing data prompted some investors to sell risky assets.
 This helped the dollar stay above a 15-year trough against
the yen, as investors were also wary that Japanese authorities
may act to rein in strength in the Japanese currency, although
many in the market expect an eventual yen appreciation.
 Safe-haven flows on the view that the global economic
recovery is losing steam have supported the dollar, but some
analysts said a brighter economic outlook in the euro zone than
in the U.S. would help to boost the euro in the coming months.
 ""The U.S. numbers were weak yesterday, and so the view has
strengthened that we will see monetary tightening to start
earlier in the euro zone,"" said Sven Schubert, currency analyst
at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 Data showed on Thursday new U.S. jobless claims marked a
nine-month high last week, and Mid-Atlantic manufacturing shrank
in August for the first time in more than a year, deepening
worries about the U.S. economic recovery.
 Strong German GDP data has raised optimism about economic
prospects in the euro zone, which has been struggling with debt
problems. This has helped to narrow the benchmark U.S./euro zone
government bond yield spread since June.
 Some analysts say the euro may benefit versus the dollar if
the euro zone shows only a moderate slowdown later this year as
it would boost the view that the European Central Bank may raise
interest rates before the Federal Reserve.
 ""The rate differential (between the euro zone and the U.S.)
has to rise further to support the dollar,"" Schubert at CS said.
 By 0749 GMT, the euro was flat on the day at $1.2814,
pulling away from the day's low of $1.2792. European shares
bobbed in and out of positive territory after Asian markets
fell in the aftermath of the weak U.S. data.
 The single currency held above $1.2730 hit earlier in the
week, its weakest since late July.
 The dollar index was flat on the day at 82.469. Earlier this
week the gauge of the dollar's value against a currency basket
hit a three-week high of 83.016.
 
 DOLLAR HOLDS ABOVE 85 YEN
 It slipped slightly against the Swiss franc to 1.0302
francs, trading hear a seven-month low of 1.0254 hit on
Thursday. The safe-haven franc has gained sharply against a
other currencies, indicating investors remain risk-averse.
 The dollar was unchanged at 85.39 yen, hovering above 84.72
yen hit last week for the first time since 1995.
 The U.S. currency has taken a hit versus the yen in past
weeks as U.S. Treasury yields have tumbled due to concerns about
the U.S. economy, narrowing their spread with Japanese
government bonds and tarnishing their appeal.
 Investors were wary of extending the yen's recent gains
ahead of an expected meeting between Japan's prime minister and
central bank governor. Some in the market suspect they may
discuss ways to prevent the yen from climbing further.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2010 03:28AM ET</span>",Q+A-How does yen's rise affect Japan's forex account?," By Yoko Nishikawa
 TOKYO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The yen's surge to a 15-year high
against the dollar is deepening paper losses in an account that
holds Japan's foreign currency assets, threatening to shrink a
source the government hopes to tap to fill gaps in its budget.
 Japan has vowed to cap new bond issuance for the year from
April 2011, but a fragile economic recovery is hurting tax
revenue, making the heavily indebted government deseparate to
find other sources of funds to fill the budget hole.
 Below are some questions and answers about Japan's special
foreign exchange account.
 WHY DOES THE FOREX ACCOUNT MATTER?
 The Foreign Exchange Fund Special Account (FEFSA), one of
18 special budget accounts, has been a star contributor to
filling in gaps in the main budget, or the general account, in
recent years.
 It earns surplus funds from investment in foreign bonds
with higher yields than those on three-month financing bills
issued by Japan to fund past yen-selling intervention. Some or
all of that surplus is then transferred to the main budget
every year.
 In the fiscal year to next March 31, 2.85 trillion yen
($33.40 billion) will be transferred to the main budget -- the
largest transfer ever and roughly one-third of the 10.6
trillion yen in non-tax revenues that help finance the 92
trillion yen main budget.
 The government will likely seek a similar amount of non-tax
revenues, including a transfer of surplus funds from the
foreign exchange account, to help fund next year's budget.
 HOW DOES THE YEN'S RISE AFFECT THE ACCOUNT?
 Through the account, the finance ministry (MOF) manages $1
trillion of foreign reserves, the world's second-largest after
China's.
 Those assets are mostly held in dollars, but they are
recorded in yen terms in the account. Thus, if the yen rises
there could be valuation losses in the account.
 Those losses would not be realised until the ministry sold
foreign assets and converted them back into yen -- a scenario
seen as unlikely given government worries about the yen's rise.
 Still, to sustain the health of the account on the books,
the MOF has accumulated a reserve fund within the account, now
standing at just over 20 trillion yen, to cushion any potential
losses from a stronger yen and any reversal in U.S.-Japan
interest rate differentials.
 At 85 yen per dollar, paper losses would be as high as 31
trillion yen, based on government projections. That implies a
net shortfall of about 10 trillion yen.
 HOW MUCH COULD THE GOVT DRAW FROM THE ACCOUNT?
 The government is expected to tap the FEFSA's surplus funds
to help fill the gap in the next year's main budget. But such
funds would probably be a couple of trillion yen at most.
 Lawmakers' worries about growing paper losses in the
account will make it trickier to aggressively dig into the
funds. As the valuation losses expand, the government will be
even more cautious about breaking into the reserves, around
20.6 trillion yen, to seek extra funds to help fund the budget.
 In addition, the forex account may earn less surplus than
before due to a drop in interest rate income from foreign
assets.
 Japan manages 92 percent of its foreign reserves by
investing in foreign, mostly government, bonds. The 10-year
U.S. Treasury yield hit a 17-month low of 2.557 percent this
week .
 Dumping foreign assets to free up cash would be equivalent
to yen-buying intervention and not an option for Japan right
now. In addition, any yen cash raised by doing so must be used
to redeem financing bills issued to finance past yen-selling
intervention.
 WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S LESS AVAILABLE FROM THE ACCOUNT?
 The Democratic Party-led government would need to cut
spending including that on steps promised when it swept to
power last year, dig deeper into other special accounts, or
issue more debt.
But with public debt nearly twice the size of the $5 trillion
yen economy, the government wants to avoid issuing more bonds.
So less money for fiscal steps could boost government pressure
on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy to beat
deflation.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2010 02:16AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Dubai to meet fixed-income investors in Asia," * Dubai to launch non-deal fixed income roadshow in Asia
 * Dubai government restructuring $23.5 billion in debt
 
 DUBAI, Aug 20, (Reuters) - The Dubai government, which is
restructuring $23.5 billion in debt, will launch a roadshow for
fixed-income investors in Asia starting on Aug. 26, a government
statement released on Friday said.
 The plan follows a similar program for European investors in
June, as part of the government's strategy for ""providing
regular updates to both existing and prospective fixed income
investors around the world.""
 The roadshow was a non-deal one, indicating no immediate
bond issue.
 The meetings, organized by HSBC and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group, which are scheduled to take place on Aug. 26 in Hong Kong
and Aug. 27 in Singapore, the statement said.
 Dubai launched a $6.5 billion bond programme last October,
made up of $4 billion euro medium term notes and a $2.5 billion
Islamic loan. It placed almost $2 billion in five-year Islamic
bonds in late October.
 Dubai's troubles shut international debt markets to primary
issuers from the region for months, but several firms, notably
Saudi ones, have tapped the market this year. Despite the uptick
in issuance, pricing remains a worry. 
 In April, Dubai utility DEWA raised $1 billion in an issue
that offered a coupon of 8.5 percent. 
 The Dubai finance ministry's 2014 Islamic bond was off 0.35
points to a mid-point of 94.6, with a yield of 7.86 percent.
 The Gulf Arab emirate is grappling with the debt
restructuring of its core state-linked firms in the wake of a
long boom that abruptly ended in the collapse of its property
market.
Last year, Dubai stunned global markets with news it would
delay debt payments linked to its flagship conglomerate Dubai
World. The firm said in May it had reached a deal in principle
to restructure $23.5 billion with core bank creditors.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against the yen
on Friday but stayed within reach of a 15-year trough hit last
week, after weaker U.S. data prompted investors to sell
higher-yielding currencies and stocks on risk aversion.
 Data showed on Thursday that new U.S. jobless claims marked a
nine-month high last week, and Mid-Atlantic manufacturing shrank
in August for the first time in more than a year, deepening
worries about the U.S. economic recovery.
 Assets with less risk such as government bonds, the yen and
the Swiss franc benefited from concerns about the world's biggest
economy.
 Against the Japanese currency, the greenback fell on Thursday
towards a 15-year low of 84.72 yen, while two-year U.S. Treasury
yields hit an all-time low.
 The dollar/yen rate has a high correlation with U.S. and
Japanese government bond yield spreads, which are now narrowing.
 But the dollar has managed to rise above the psychologically
key 85.00 yen level thanks to caution among traders about
possible intervention by Japanese authorities.
 ""Safe-haven demand dominates financial markets once again,""
said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the foreign securities
department at Okasan Securities.
 ""Everyone thinks the dollar will extend losses against the
yen. But fears of intervention and caution about additional
monetary easing steps in Japan are making players hesitate to
aggressively sell the dollar for now.""
 The dollar fell as low as 85.19 yen in early Asian trade
before climbing back to 85.47 yen, up 0.1 percent from late U.S.
trade.
 Against the Swiss franc, the dollar edged up 0.1 percent to
1.0323 francs, having dropped to a seven-month low of 1.0257
francs on Thursday.
 The dollar index, gauge of its performance against a basket
of six major currencies, inched up 0.1 percent to 82.532.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.2807 after falling as low
as $1.2772 on trading platform EBS on Thursday. Support comes in
at the 100-day moving average around $1.2770.
 Against the yen, the single European currency hit a
seven-week low of 109.02 yen on EBS but found support at the
psychologically important 109.00 level. A fall below 109.00 yen
would open the way for a slide towards an 8-½ year low of
107.30 yen reached in late June, traders said. The euro was flat
at 109.48 yen.
 There is market talk of large stop loss orders below the
108.80 yen area for the pair, while bids are seen sitting mostly
around 108.95/96 yen yen, traders said.
 MARKET PONDERS BOJ MOVE
 The Bank of Japan may consider easing monetary policy next
month and is lining up its options, but is in no mood to act in
the near term.
 But there has been persistent speculation that the yen's
strength may nudge it to act before its September rate review, or
even before a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and BOJ
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected next week.
 Traders said investors speculate the BOJ will tweak its new
fund supply operation introduced last December or buy more
Japanese government bonds.
 ""The yen is highly unlikely to reverse its upward trend if
the BOJ only announces an extension of its new operation,"" said a
trader at a big Japanese bank. ""Many people doubt the step's
effectiveness in helping the economy.""
 Even if any new policy measures boost major currencies
against the yen, Japanese exporters who have been unable to sell
enough dollars and euros due to the yen's recent strength will
use any bounce in those currencies as an opportunity to
repatriate their overseas profits, traders say.
 The Australian dollar was softer a day before Australia's
general election on Saturday as concerns about a slowdown in the
United States dented appetite for higher-yielding currencies and
other types of assets with more risks. The Aussie dipped 0.1
percent to $0.8915.

 * Risk aversion in play after weak US data
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The dollar inched down against the
yen on Friday, coming within reach of a 15-year trough hit last
week, after weak U.S. data prompted investors to sell
higher-yielding currencies and stocks on risk aversion.
 Data showed on Thursday that new U.S. jobless claims marked a
nine-month high last week, and Mid-Atlantic manufacturing shrank
in August for the first time in more than a year, deepening
worries about the fragile U.S. economic recovery.
 Meanwhile, safe-haven assets, such as government bonds, the
yen and the Swiss francs benefitted.
 Against the Japanese currency, the greenback fell to near a
15-year low of 84.72 yen the previous day, when two-year U.S.
Treasury yields hit an all-time low.
 The dollar/yen rate has a high correlation with U.S. and
Japanese government bond yield spreads, which are now narrowing.
 But the dollar has managed to rise above the psychologically
key 85.00 yen level thanks to trader caution about possible
intervention by Japanese authorities.
 ""Save-haven demand dominates financial markets, once again,""
said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the foreign securities
department at Okasan Securities.
 ""Everyone thinks the dollar will extend losses against the
yen. But fears of intervention and caution about additional
monetary easing steps in Japan are making players hesitate to
aggressively sell the dollar for now.""
 In early Asian trade, the dollar was down 0.2 percent from
late U.S. trade at 85.25 yen.
 Against the Swiss franc, the U.S. currency edged up 0.1
percent to 1.0323 franc, having struck a seven-month low of
1.0257 franc on Thursday.
 The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.2807 after falling as low
as $1.2772 on trading platform EBS on Thursday. Support comes in
at the 100-day moving average around $1.2770.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to 109.16 yen, with support at
109.07 yen, a seven-week low hit earlier this week, and 109.00
yen. Falling below 109.00 yen will open the way for a slide
towards an 8-½ year low of 107.30 yen reached in late June,
traders said.

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Fear gripped world markets on
Thursday, pummeling stocks and driving the dollar to a near
15-year low against the yen as the latest economic data spurred
new worries of a deepening slowdown in the United States that
could reverberate around the world.
 Investors fled for the safety of U.S. Treasuries and gold,
sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to its lowest
level since April 2009 and driving gold to a seven-week high in
New York.
 New U.S. claims for first-time jobless benefits scaled a
nine-month high last week, while the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia reported an unexpected contraction in
manufacturing in the Mid-Atlantic region.
 ""The U.S. macroeconomic numbers once again increased doubts
regarding the strengths of the U.S. economy in the second half
and raised concerns that the economy might be weakening more
than previously anticipated,"" said Tammo Greetfeld, equity
strategist at UniCredit in Munich.
 ""Investors ... will increasingly ask themselves how much
scope the U.S. central bank actually does have to successfully
counter an economic downturn, if needed.""
 The president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, James
Bullard, said the U.S. central bank may need to enlarge its
bond purchases if the economic recovery slows further.

 Initial U.S. unemployment claims unexpectedly rose by
12,000 to 500,000 in the week ended Aug. 14, marking a third
straight week of gains, the Labor Department reported.
 And the contraction reported by the Philadelphia Fed in its
business activity index confounded markets that had been
expecting a rise. [ID:nN19350083]
 ""The risk of double-dip has increased,"" said Jim Baird,
chief investment strategist at Plante Moran Financial Advisors
in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""Investors are trimming their exposure
to risky assets.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 144.33
points, or 1.39 percent, at 10,271.21. The benchmark Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 18.53 points, or 1.69 percent,
at 1,075.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 36.75
points, or 1.66 percent, at 2,178.95.
 The selloff was broad, with five stocks falling for every
one rising on the New York Stock Exchange. Sectors most
sensitive to growth were hit hardest. Manufacturers 3M ,
United Technologies , and Boeing  were the biggest
drags on the Dow.
 On the other side of the Atlantic, European shares hit a
one-month closing low. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of
top European shares fell for a second straight session and
ended down 1.5 percent at 1,036.84 points, the lowest close
since July 21.
 Overall, the MSCI All-Country World equity index
<.MIWD00000PUS> fell 1.1 percent after hitting its highest in
more than a week earlier in the session.
 Latin America stocks were pressured by concerns about
slowing growth in the United States, which is Mexico's top
trading partner and a major influence on the region.
 DOLLAR WEAKENS
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 85.33 yen , off a
session low of 84.89 touched after the Philly Fed factory data,
but still off a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading
platform EBS last week.
 The dollar also fell more than 1 percent versus the Swiss
franc to trade as low as 1.0295 , a level last seen Jan.
19, according to Reuters data.
 The euro  was down 0.29 percent at $1.2818 from a
previous session close of $1.2855.
 The jobless claims figure ""fits in with a gloomier
assessment of the U.S. economy, and the yen has gained a bit on
it,"" said Brown Brothers Harriman's Thin. ""But people are still
questioning whether to sell the dollar on weak U.S. data or buy
it on a general move away from risk.""
 Benefiting from the renewed flight to safety, U.S.
Treasuries and gold prices rose.
 ""The Philly Fed report is concerning because it had been
showing the economy was doing okay,"" said Ira Jersey,
interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.
 ""But now it is showing the new orders and employment
components are in negative territory. That's bad news for the
economy and good news for the Treasuries market.""
 Long-dated debt led the rally, with the yield on 30-year
bond  hitting a 16-month low of 3.622 percent and
the 10-year note yield  posting a 17-month low at
2.557 percent. The two-year yield  touched an
all-time low of 0.475 percent.
In energy and commodities prices, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 fell 99 cents, or 1.31 percent, to settle at $74.43 per
barrel, and spot gold prices  rose $2.30, or 0.19
percent, to $1,230.80. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB>
was down 1.68 points, or 0.62 percent, at 268.22.
 Copper prices  dropped from a two-week high on the
London Metal Exchange to trade at $7,352 a tonne from $7,390 a
tonne at the close on Wednesday, while oil  dropped below
$75 per barrel.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar on Thursday
dropped near a 15-year low versus the yen but rose against the
euro after weak U.S. economic data and steep losses in the
stock market reignited risk aversion.
 Mid-Atlantic factory activity contracted in August for the
first time in more than a year and new U.S. jobless claims
scaled a nine-month high last week, delivering another blow to
the fragile U.S. economic recovery.
 Investors flocked to safe havens such as the U.S. dollar,
yen and Swiss franc. A decline in U.S. bond yields on worries
about the economy also helped the yen gain versus the
greenback, though investors were reluctant to chase it higher
amid fears Japanese authorities may take steps to rein in the
currency.
 ""If you look at the Swiss franc and if you look at what the
equity markets are doing, the euro's weakness would be
consistent with higher risk aversion,"" said Vassili
Serebriakov, currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""But we would suspect that the markets are wary of pushing
the yen too high at this juncture, given the possible
escalation in rhetoric from Japanese officials,"" he added.
 In late trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2822,
after touching a session trough of $1.2773, according to
Reuters data. Support comes in at the 100-day moving average
around $1.2776.
 The dollar lost 0.1 percent to 85.33 yen. It hit a session
low of 84.89 on electronic trading platform EBS, within
striking distance of a 15-year low of 84.72 set last week.
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business
activity index for the Mid-Atlantic region fell to minus 7.7,
confounding markets that had expected a rise to 7.0. Any number
below zero indicates a shrinking in the region's
manufacturing.
 ""The Philly Fed number is shockingly bad, resulting in the
U.S. two-year making new lows in yield,"" said Douglas
Borthwick, managing director at Faros Trading LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut. ""With yields at these lows the dollar is quickly
becoming the funding currency of choice.""
 A funding currency is used in carry trades, which involve
borrowing in a low-yielding currency to buy higher-yielding
assets elsewhere. Though not inherently bad for the dollar,
being a funding currency weakens the unit as investors borrow
it, then immediately sell it.
 DOLLAR GAINS CAPPED
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which measures the
greenback versus a basket of currencies, rose 0.3 percent to
82.442.
 Gains in the dollar were limited, however, as a recent
string of weak U.S. data fueled worries about the possibility
of a double-dip recession and sparked talk of additional easing
measures from the Federal Reserve to boost the economy.
 ""People are still questioning whether to sell the dollar on
weak U.S. data or buy it on a general move away from risk,""
said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York.
 Wells Fargo's Serebriakov expects to see some dollar
weakness in the short term as U.S. data will likely stay weak,
but he added this may be somewhat offset should global stocks
react negatively and boost safe-haven demand.
 The dollar hit a seven-month low versus the Swiss franc and
was last down 1 percent at 1.0320. The euro lost 1.3 percent to
1.3228 francs.
 Investors were watching to see if the Bank of Japan will
take more monetary easing steps -- such as expanding liquidity
-- ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and BOJ
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected on Monday.
 The yen earlier slipped as rumors circulated that the
central bank would hold an emergency policy meeting. Sources
later said this was unlikely.

(Adds API data and post-settlement prices)
 By David Sheppard
 NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Brent oil futures rose above
$98 a barrel on Wednesday on supply concerns in the North Sea,
but a stuttering economic recovery in the United States kept
prices off the key $100 level and saw U.S. crude ease for a
second day.
 Trading sources said Hetco, a trading firm partly owned and
backed by U.S. energy giant Hess Corp, has taken control of ten
North Sea crude oil cargoes, which traders said give it more
influence over the spot market.
 Tighter supplies in the North Sea and soaring emerging
market demand for oil has pushed Brent crude oil futures close
to $100 a barrel for the first time since October 2008.
 By contrast, U.S. crude futures have traded at an uncommon
discount to Brent since August, with bulging inventories around
the delivery point for the NYMEX contract in Cushing, Oklahoma
weighing on prices.
 ""It's a story of relative supply,"" said Andy Lebow, a
trader at MF Global in New York.
 ""Brent has seen tight supplies and good demand from Asia,
while the expectations are supplies will remain at high levels
around Cushing.""
 Late on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said U.S.
crude stocks rose by 3.53 million barrels in the week to Jan.
14, while distillate and gasoline stocks also rose by 940,000
and 1.86 million barrels respectively, despite a drop in
refinery output. Stocks at Cushing fell by 571,000 barrels,
according to the API.
 U.S. crude oil inventories were forecast to have fallen by
600,000 barrels last week while gasoline and distillate stocks
were expected to be higher, according to a Reuters poll. Weekly
fuel stock data from the U.S. government is out on Thursday at
11:00 EST (1600 GMT), delayed by one day because of a public
holiday on Monday.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for March rose 36 cents, to
settle at $98.16 a barrel, just over a dollar below the
27-month high of $99.20 hit last Friday. It slipped in
post-settlement trade to $97.95 after the API numbers.
 Volumes on Brent were 16 percent above the 30-day average
with over 4.26 million barrels changing hands.
 U.S. crude futures for February delivery fell 52 cents to
settle at $90.86 a barrel, one day ahead of the contract's
expiry, in relatively thin trade. Prices slipped another 22
cents in post-settlement trade.
 U.S. oil product futures were stronger, with both RBOB
gasoline futures and heating oil futures hitting the highest
since October 2008.
 Tim Evans, an analyst at Citigroup Futures Perspective in
New York, said a dip in U.S. equity markets was, ""shifting the
immediate focus from a weaker U.S. dollar to worries over the
strength of the U.S. recovery"".
 Goldman, arguably the world's most powerful bank and one of
the biggest financial players in commodities, posted a 53
percent decline in fourth-quarter profits on Wednesday, as
revenue from fixed income, commodity and currency trading
fell.
 In the broader economy, groundbreaking on new U.S. home
construction fell to its lowest level in over a year in
December, suggesting the battered housing sector remains a
major roadblock to the recovery.
 Commodity prices were supported as the euro rallied to an
eight-week high above $1.35 against the dollar. Analysts said
there is rising confidence European policymakers will stop the
debt crisis that has engulfed Greece and Ireland from
spreading.
 A weaker dollar increases the purchasing power of holders
of other currencies, a bullish factor for commodities like oil
that are priced in the U.S. currency.
 DEMAND IS UP, IS OPEC OUTPUT?
 The International Energy agency has revised its 2011 global
oil demand forecast higher to 89.13 million barrels per day
(bpd), an all-time record, but said OPEC leader Saudi Arabia
was quietly boosting output to cool the oil price rally.
 Analysts and traders, however, including some of the
Kingdom's big customers, were sceptical and said that Saudi
output was flat in December. Rising demand with no clear
increase in supply from the producer group has been one of the
factors pushing Brent towards $100.
 For now, technical analysts saw oil as neutral and said
Brent was unlikely to breach the 27-month high of $99.20
reached last week.
 In the United States, oil supplies looked set to improve,
with Alaska's main oil pipeline about to restore shipments to
its normal rate of 630,000 barrels bpd in the coming days from
around 510,000 bpd, after its recent shutdown due to a leak.

"
549,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2010 11:04AM ET</span>",Q+A-What is at stake in S.African state workers' strike?," By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 29 (Reuters) - A strike by more than 1
million South African state workers is set to widen this week
with about 2 million members in the country's largest labour
federation COSATU downing tools on Thursday.
 Below are some questions and answers about the strike and
its impact on Africa's largest economy:
 
 WHO IS ON STRIKE?
 A coalition of more than a dozen unions which represent 1.3
million state employees including teachers, police, nurses,
customs officials and office workers walked off the job about
three weeks ago.
 
 WHAT IS THE DISPUTE ABOUT?
 Unions want a pay rise of 8.6 percent and 1,000 rand
($135.8) a month for housing, compared with 500 rand now. The
government has offered 7 percent and 700 rand.
 The lowest-paid public servants make 40 percent less than
the average worker, who earns 6,383 rand a month in salary and
benefits. Mid-range public servants make about 40 percent more
than average.
 
 HOW LONG COULD THE STRIKE GO ON?
 Analysts expect a deal in early September as pressure mounts
on President Jacob Zuma and unions to reach a deal.
 Zuma does not want to have the dispute hanging over him
heading into his ruling African National Congress's main
policy-setting meeting in late September. 
 He also needs to make a deal quickly to prevent any more
damage in the ANC's long-standing alliance with organised labour
after COSATU said last week ties were near rupture.
 Rank and file union members are not receiving pay during the
strike and many cannot afford being off the job much longer,
putting pressure on labour leaders to reach a deal.
 
 HOW SERIOUS IS THE COSATU THREAT?
 COSATU affiliated unions are in industries critical to the
economy, including mining, manufacturing and communications.
Hundreds of thousands of its affiliated union members are
already taking part in the state workers' strike. 
 The COSATU one-day strike on Thursday would not have major
economic impact. 
 But COSATU has also threatened a prolonged labour action of
all of its group members, which would have an enormous economic
impact that stokes worries about growth prospects, as the
economy slowed more than expected in the second quarter of 2010.

 
 HOW MUCH WILL THE STRIKE HURT THE ECONOMY?
 One leading economist said the strike is costing about $150
million a day. No official numbers have been released.
 
 HOW HARD WILL THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET BE HIT?
 Meeting union demands could mean an extra 10 billion rand or
more on the 880 billion rand state budget. Agreeing to a 1,000
rand housing allowance alone would add nearly 8 billion rand. 
 The government had previously budgeted for pay rises of 5.2
percent, meaning even its offer of 7 percent would add billions.
 Any deal will make it harder to bring down the deficit from
6.7 percent of gross domestic product, leading to increased
borrowing or higher taxes that would crimp consumer spending and
hurt a fragile economic recovery.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - An unexpected rise in U.S.
jobless claims weighed on global stocks and the dollar on
Thursday, sending investors to seek refuge in U.S. Treasury
debt and gold.
 The U.S. dollar weakened further against the yen and hit a
seven-month low against the Swiss franc after data showed new
claims for U.S. unemployment benefits climbed to a nine-month
high last week.

For details, see [ID:nN19350083]

 The third consecutive increase in weekly jobless claims
disappointed analysts, who expected that number to fall, and
reinforced concerns about a double-dip economic recession.
 ""It's worse than expected. The jobs issue will continue to
hang over the stock market, as it hangs over the rest of the
nation, raising continuing issues regarding consumer and
investor confidence,"" said Fred Dickson, chief market
strategist at The Davidson Cos in Lake Oswego, Oregon.
 The data also offset earlier optimism brought by the
Bundesbank, which said the German economy is set to grow by
around 3 percent this year, better than a previous forecast of
almost 2 percent. [ID:nBAF004214]
 ""If the economy is going down, there's no way the euro zone
can withstand the slowdown. It's too early to say we're headed
for a double dip, but things are slowing,"" said Win Thin,
senior currency strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York.
 Investor sentiment further deteriorated after the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said factory activity in the
U.S. Mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly contracted in August to
its lowest level in more than a year. [ID:nN19129903]
 The MSCI All-Country World equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
slipped 0.7 percent after hitting its highest in more than a
week earlier on the session.
 European shares turned negative after the jobs data and
added to losses following the U.S. business conditions data,
sending the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> 0.9 percent lower.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> lost 117.76 points,
or 1.13 percent, to 10,297.78, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> declined 13.49 points, or 1.23 percent, to
1,080.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 24.81
points, or 1.12 percent, to 2,190.89.
 DOLLAR WEAKENS
 The dollar weakened against major currencies, with the U.S.
Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.11 percent.
 The greenback lost 0.47 percent against the Japanese yen
, to 85.02 yen. It also fell more than 1 percent versus
the Swiss franc and traded as low as 1.0295 , a level
last seen Jan. 19, according to Reuters data.
 The euro  rose 0.16 percent against the dollar to
$1.2875.
 ""Claims fits in with a gloomier assessment of the U.S.
economy, and the yen has gained a bit on it,"" said Brown
Brothers Harriman's Thin. ""But people are still questioning
whether to sell the dollar on weak U.S. data or buy it on a
general move away from risk.""
 Benefiting from a renewed flight to safety, U.S. Treasuries
prices rose further.
 The benchmark 10-year notes  gained 10/32 in
price, with the yield at 2.6017 percent. The 30-year bonds
 were up more than a full point in price, with the
yield at 3.6779 percent.
 Gold also rallied on a safe-haven bid. Prices for the metal
hit a seven-week high of $1,235.50, up 0.57 percent on the
day.
 Oil prices declined on concerns about the global economy.
U.S. crude oil prices  fell 77 cents, or 1.02 percent, to
$74.65 per barrel.

 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to near a
15-year low against the yen on Thursday, after weak U.S.
economic reports fueled concerns about the strength of the U.S.
economic recovery and pushed U.S. bond yields lower.
 The most recent release indicated factory activity in the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly
contracted in August for the first in more than a year,
heightening worries over the sustainability of the economic
recovery. For details, click [ID:nEAH104J00]
 The yen was lower earlier in the global session, with
investors reluctant to chase it higher because of jitters about
whether Japanese authorities would take new steps to rein in
the yen's rise.
 But the dollar's gains were reversed as the New York
session got underway after the U.S. Labor Department reported
initial claims for state jobless benefits rose to 500,000 in
the latest week. Markets were expecting claims of 476,000
[ID:nN18197408].
 ""The Philly Fed number is shockingly bad, resulting in the
U.S. 2-year making new lows in yield,"" said Douglas Borthwick,
managing director at Faros Trading LLC in Stamford Connecticut.
 ""The lower yield is playing into the forex markets, as
dollar/yen breaches the 85.00 level. With yields at these lows
the dollar is quickly becoming the funding currency of choice.""
Midway through the New York morning, the dollar was down 0.6
percent at 84.94 yen , just off the session low of 84.90
touched after the factory data but still off a 15-year low of
84.72 yen hit on trading platform EBS last week.
 ""People are still questioning whether to sell the dollar on
weak U.S. data or buy it on a general move away from risk,""
said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers

 The bank's view is that any weakness in the U.S. economy
won't be isolated, said Thin.
 ""If the economy is going down, there's no way the euro zone
can withstand the slowdown,"" Thin said.
 The euro was 0.2 percent higher against the dollar 
at $1.2884 with support at the 100-day moving average around
$1.2776. It again struggled to break through $1.2900 with a
peak of 1.2902.
 The dollar fell to a seven-month low against the Swiss
franc .
 The euro, supported by an upward revision of German growth
forecasts from the Bundesbank, got a further bid by some buyers
betting the euro zone may have a better economic outlook
despite recent fiscal woes. [ID:nAHLIJE65T]
 SUMMER LIQUIDITY
 Analysts were again cautious however on reading too much
into any move given relatively light liquidity during the
summer vacation months.
 The euro came under pressure in early trade after a report
on the website of German magazine Der Spiegel said austerity
steps to fix Greece's debt were harming the Greek economy. For
a link to the article see: http://link.reuters.com/vyf85n
 The euro's recovery came in tandem with a rise in sterling
, which jumped more than a cent against the dollar after
surprisingly strong retail sales raised hopes the UK's economic
recovery could maintain its momentum. [ID:nUKLJJE638]
 Sterling was up 0.4 percent at $1.5660.
 And investors were still watching to see if the Bank of
Japan will take more monetary easing steps -- such as expanding
liquidity -- ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto
Kan and BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected on Monday.
The yen slipped early as rumours circulated that the central
bank would hold an emergency policy meeting. Although sources
later said this was unlikely [ID:nTKW007065], caution kept the
yen away from 15-year highs versus the dollar.
 ""There was a lot of speculation about whether the BoJ would
hold an emergency meeting. It didn't happen but there is still
tension and nervousness about what action the BoJ could take,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.
 Japanese Prime Minister Kan said he would talk to the
country's economics minister and finance minister and the
ruling Democratic Party's policy chief on the state of the
economy and possible stimulus steps by the end of August.
 Japan's Sankei newspaper said on Thursday the BOJ is
considering additional monetary easing steps in line with
government efforts to support the economy. [ID:nTOE67H06U] 
 Analysts said potential measures may have limited effect in
weakening the yen, while most in the market do not expect
Japanese authorities will intervene directly to curb the yen's
rise unless the dollar falls closer to 80 yen.

 By Sahar Ahmed
 KARACHI, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Pakistan's textile industry is
asking for greater access to the U.S and European Union markets
as it struggles for survival after floods devastated the
country.
 Industry representatives say flood damage to the cotton crop
and consequent supply shortages could be a final blow to an
industry that is already under pressure from shrinking global
demand, crippling power shortages and instability brought on by
a Taliban insurgency.
 Textile makers are asking for support to help make up for
the losses.
 ""We have requested that the government ask the EU and U.S.
for greater market access,"" said an official at the All Pakistan
Textile Mills Association.
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told reporters in
Islamabad on Thursday that the EU was mulling a meeting of its
foreign ministers to discuss providing flood assistance to
Pakistan, and possibly greater market access for Pakistani
products.
 Some products from Pakistan enter the EU market duty-free or
at a reduced rate, but textile products such as bed linen and
towels, which account for more than 65 percent of its exports to
the EU, still face a 12 percent tariff.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Pakistan's total textile exports stood at over $10 billion
in the 2009/10 financial year (July-June), of which about $6
billon worth of textile products went to the United States and
the European Union.
 The floods, the worst in the country's history, have killed
up to 1,600 people, forced more than 4 million from their homes
and disrupted the lives of about 20 million people - nearly 12
percent of the population.
 The floods also damaged up to 2 million bales of cotton, and
traders say Pakistan will have to import up to 3 million bales
to make up for a shortfall. A Pakistani cotton bale weighs 170
kg.
 Pakistan produced 12.7 million bales in the 2009/10
(July-June) financial year, when the country had to import about
2 million bales, and was hoping to harvest 14 million from the
2010/11 crop.
 ""This is really the worst time possible for textiles -- that
the floods could have occurred -- because textile mills have no
cotton,"" said Ziad Bashir, director of Gul Ahmed Textile Mills,
Ltd, one of the country's biggest mills.
 ""The devastation they (floods) are causing definitely
warrants an action like this (duty-free status for Pakistan's
textile products).""
 The textile sector is the source of over half the country's
exports and about 40 percent of manufacturing jobs. Low output
could further add to Pakistan's trade deficit.
 ""The government, in consultation with the industry, will
take appropriate measures to help the textile sector, depending
upon the extent of damage to the crop,"" said Textile Ministry
Secretary Waqar Masood.
 Textile mill owners say any further damage to the cotton
crop would be devastating.
 ""If the floods continue, and this (the amount of cotton crop
loss) goes up to 4 million or something, it's going to be
colossal,"" Bashir said.

 * Small risks so far, but business will grow - analysts
 * Nintendo, Sony don't fear the challenge - executives
 By Christoph Steitz
 FRANKFURT, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The explosion in smartphone
gaming has traditional console makers in a quandary: join the
mobile trend and risk cannibalising your business or hope the
rich, home video gaming experience will always trump convenience
on the move.
 The three big console hardware makers, Nintendo, Microsoft
and Sony, have been struggling to lure new customers and retain
old ones.
 Motion-controlled gaming systems is one of their major hopes
to breathe new life into the struggling $60-billion video game
hardware and software market.
 But even this will only cushion an expected 5-percent
decline in sales in 2011 to about 50 million units, according to
research firm iSuppli.
 While traditional consoles -- Sony's Playstation 3,
Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii -- remain the industry's
cash cow, gaming on smartphones, unleashed by Apple's iPhone,
has sky-rocketed.
 Research firm Gartner expects global revenue from mobile
gaming, the segment that includes games for smartphones, to rise
19 percent to more than $5.6 billion this year, while it is
forecast to grow to $11.4 billion in 2014.
 The company estimates that up to 80 percent of all
downloaded mobile consumer applications are mobile games.
 The boom has already reached investors, as small game
developers -- such as Rovio, the maker of the Angry Birds game
for the iPhone -- are already receiving bidding approaches from
potential buyers.
 ""Smartphone gaming is being adopted at a much higher pace
than mobile phone games overall. It is taking up a lot of time
and that means that customers have less time playing a
(dedicated) handheld device,"" Ed Barton, senior analyst at
research firm ScreenDigest, said.
 Researchers at iSuppli say factory unit shipments of
game-capable mobile phones are expected to rise 11.4 percent to
1.27 billion this year.
 This compares with a largely flat video game console
market, seen up just 0.2 percent at 52.3 million in 2010.
Handheld device units are even expected to decline by 2.5
percent to 38.9 million.
 
 LESS THAN FULFILLING
 Smartphones may only account for about a fifth of the
broader handset market. But according to Goldman Sachs, the
sector's 56 percent growth rate outpaces a 10 percent expansion
of the overall handset market.
 A study by digital market research firm ComScore Inc showed
that the number of U.S. smartphone gamers increased by 60
percent between February 2009 and the same month this year.
 ScreenDigest's Barton said that while gaming on smartphones
was still a small business in terms of revenues, it was a
potential ""threat to the dedicated handheld device"" in the years
to come.
 Sony, the maker of the Playstation Portable (PSP), played
down the potential threat.
 ""I find it a less-than-fulfilling experience,"" Andrew House,
the European head of Sony Computer Entertainment, told Reuters
at Gamescom, Europe's biggest video game trade fair, adding that
playing games on smartphones was limited in terms of user
experience.
 The German head of Nintendo, maker of the Gameboy and the DS
handhelds as well as creator of the video game character Super
Mario, struck a similar note, pointing to new devices such as a
3-D version of the DS which offers a gaming experience far
superior to smartphones.
 Microsoft, alone among the three hardware makers in not
having a handheld console in its offering, has already joined
the frenzy.
 This week at Gamescom, Europe's biggest video game trade
fair, the company announced it would offer high-quality games
for smartphones that use the Windows Phone 7 application.
 According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, Microsoft trades at
10.3 times estimated 12-month forward earnings, a discount to
both Sony as well as Nintendo, whose German head said it
remained to be seen how strongly game developers would engage in
smartphone gaming.
 Electronic Arts, the world's No.2 video games maker, said
earlier this week it was bullish about growth in its digital
business, that also includes games for smartphones, where it
posted a 52 percent increase in first-quarter revenue.
 ""The days when people were just putting a CD in a console
are over,"" its chief operating officer John Schappert said.

 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
yen on Thursday after data showed new U.S. weekly jobless
claims were higher than expected, adding to concerns about the

 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The symptoms of the euro zone
debt crisis will persist for at least another year, according to
a Reuters poll of 60 economists, who see governments struggling
to contain their vast debts for some time to come.
 A slowdown in the United States poses the biggest threat to
a sustainable recovery in the euro zone economy, the poll
showed, with fiscal tightening and debt worries also seen as
major risks to growth.
 The crisis -- defined in the poll as 10-year government bond
yield spreads of at least two euro zone members staying above
100 basis points over German Bunds -- will last at least a year,
according to 55 economists who answered the question.
 Twenty-six of them said it would last at least two years.
 Several euro zone governments have committed to stringent
austerity measures to regain control over swollen budget
deficits, although many of these programmes are still in the
earliest stages.
 ""Only when some of these countries translate words into
action, and some of these spreads start to come in, then perhaps
markets will fully believe we're on the road to a longer-lasting
recovery,"" said Mark Miller at Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""I think that's going to happen over a longer, rather than a
shorter, time horizon.""
 On Wednesday, Portuguese and Irish 10-year government
spreads over the equivalent German bunds hovered just under the
300 basis point mark, while the Greek spread was around 845
basis points. 
 While the 16-nation euro area enjoyed quarter-on-quarter
growth of 1.0 percent during April-June, attention has shifted
over the last month or so from the sovereign debt crisis in
Europe to the fast-cooling U.S. economy. 
 Growth there slowed to an annualised rate of 2.4 percent in
the second quarter from 3.7 percent in the first -- a figure
that could yet be revised lower after last week's appalling
trade deficit data for June and worrying unemployment trends.
 ""Over the past 40 years, a recession in the U.S. has always
been followed by a significant contraction in developed
countries' output, and in Europe in particular,"" said Slavena
Nazarova of Credit Agricole CIB.
 She added that the euro zone looks more vulnerable to any
drop in global demand today than during previous business
cycles, with medium-term growth prospects restrained by high
unemployment and a large degree of economic slack.
 Nineteen respondents cited a U.S. slowdown as the biggest
risk to the euro zone, with 15 saying fiscal tightening and 14
pointing to debt concerns, for which no end seems likely soon.
 
 GREEK RISK
 Greece, the epicentre of the crisis, is so far on track with
unprecedented measures to cut its budget deficit -- although
economists still harbour doubts about the government's ability
to sustain the painful cuts they say are needed over the years
ahead. 
 Median forecasts put the chances of a sovereign debt
restructuring in Greece over the next five years at 43 percent,
a ten percentage point hike increase over a poll conducted in
May at the height of European financial markets' volatility.
 Nearly half of respondents gave a probability for this of
greater than 50 percent in the latest poll, although overall
they gave Spain, Portugal and Ireland a 10 percent chance each
of a debt restructuring within 5 years.
 ""Debt restructuring makes sense for high-debt countries only
-- so it is a possibility for Greece, but not the other three
countries in the poll,"" said Luca Mezzomo at Intesa Sanpaolo.
 The prospect of any member state leaving the euro zone in
the next five years, mooted by a minority of economists earlier
this year, still looks remote, the survey found.
 Fifty-four described this possibility as ""unlikely"" or ""very
unlikely"", with only six saying ""likely"" or ""very likely"".
 One of those in the ""likely"" camp, Stephen Lewis of Monument
Securities, explained the global economy was still in a fragile
state and the risk of a return to recession sometime in the next
five years was high.
 ""Five years is a very long time and there are a lot of
disasters that can befall sovereign borrowers in a global
situation which is still far from settled,"" he said.

 By Aleksandras Budrys
 MOSCOW, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Russia will have to import
millions of tonnes of grain for the first time in over 10 years
after its worst drought in over a century, analysts said on
Thursday, reigniting international wheat prices.
 Analysts estimate Russia, usually a major grain exporter,
may have to import 1.5-2.2 million tonnes this year, but a
report in Vedomosti daily said Russia could import at least 5
million tonnes of grain this year 
 The Agriculture Ministry quickly denied that it was planning
to import up to 5 million tonnes of grain in the 2010/11 crop
year.
 ""Nothing of the kind is being discussed here,"" a ministry
spokeswoman said.
 Despite the denial, European and U.S. wheat prices rose
sharply, lifted by Russian import prospects that come hard on
the heels of a ban on exports for the rest of this year, aimed
at conserving stocks and heading off inflation.
 Imports of 5 million tonnes would put Russia almost on a par
with Egypt, the world's biggest wheat importer, as it competes
in international markets, keeping up the pressure on U.S. grain
prices which earlier in August soared to 2-year highs.
 Russia's deadly heatwave, which had sparked wildfires and
blanketed Moscow in smog for two weeks, was declared over on
Wednesday but is estimated to have destroyed a quarter of
Russia's grain crop and could shave $14 billion off this year's
gross domestic product.
 
 GRAIN ROBBERY
 The former Soviet Union, which included today's top Black
Sea grain growers and exporters Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan,
used to be the world's largest grain buyer importing dozens of
millions of tonnes of grain every year.
 In 1972, Moscow staged a ""great grain robbery"", emptying the
U.S. grain larder by purchasing heavily from all the major grain
exporters simulaneously.
 Imports stood at 34 million tonnes in calendar 1990, the
year before the Soviet Union collapsed.
 Imports since then declined sharply to less that a million
tonnes in the last few years, but the country has never stopped
being an importer, either buying grain, or receiving it as
humanitarian aid after disastrous crop years like 1998, when the
country harvested just 48 million tonnes.
 
 FALLING HARVEST
 Russia's total grain crop is officially expected to reach
60-65 million tonnes, although some see it struggling to get
above 60 million tonnes this year, way down from last year's 97
million tonne crop and the 108 million tonne harvest in 2008.
 Dmitry Rylko, director of the Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies (IKAR) told Reuters his organisation currently
estimated domestic seasonal grain imports of at least 2.2
million tonnes.
 He expected most of the imports to come from Kazakhstan and
Ukraine, which is also considering curbing exports after its
grain crops were hit by severe frosts and a scorching summer.
 Kazakhstan said on Thursday Russia will be among its main
export markets with 2 million tonnes of grain exports earmarked
for Russia, Iran and other countries out of total 8 million
tonne grain exports expected in the current marketing year. 
 ""We are likely to see a shift in terms of trade flows so a
lot of the exports that were coming out of the former Soviet
Union countries for wheat are now going to have to be met by
countries like Australia, Argentina and the U.S.,"" said
Sudakshina Unnikrishnan, analyst at Barclays Capital.
 
 CUSTOMS UNION
 Kazakhstan, along with Belarus, partners Russia in a newly
created customs union, which should in theory ease trade between
the countries. But neither country has chosen to join Moscow in
banning grain exports.
 Initial Russian demand is coming mainly from southern
Siberia, the Volga region and the southern Ural mountains,
regions relatively close to the Kazakh border, traders said.
 ""Kazakh wheat is of good quality and can be blended with
Russian wheat to make excellent flour,"" a trader said.
 As of July 1 Russian grain stocks were estimated at between
21.6 million tonnes and 24 million.
 Annual consumption in the 2010/11 crop year is officially
estimated at 78 million tonnes. Grain analysts expect
consumption to be between 71-75 million tonned depending on the
volume of animal slaughtering.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The yen dipped against the dollar
on Thursday as jitters about whether Japanese authorities would
take new steps to rein in the yen's rise left investors
reluctant to chase it higher.
 Investors are watching to see if the central bank will take
more monetary easing steps -- such as expanding liquidity --
ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of
Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected on Monday.
 Meanwhile, much stronger-than-expected UK retail sales data
lifted sterling and helped the euro off earlier lows against the
dollar, though lingering concerns about the health of countries
on the euro zone's periphery capped rallies.
 ""The UK numbers have boosted sentiment a little, but
generally the mood in the market seems slightly on the
pessimistic side and people are inclined to push the euro
lower,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital.
 At 1115 GMT, the dollar was up 0.2 percent at 85.60 yen
, off a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading platform
EBS last week.
 The euro was 0.1 percent lower against the dollar  at
$1.2840, helped off its low by an upward revision of German
growth forecasts from the Bundesbank. [ID:nAHLIJE65T]
 Support was at the 100-day moving average around $1.2776,
while traders noted option expiries at $1.2800 and $1.2850,
which may be exerting influence on the spot price level.
 The euro's recovery came in tandem with a rise in sterling
, which reversed early losses to jump more than a cent
against the dollar after surprisingly strong retail sales raised
hopes the UK's economic recovery could maintain its momentum.
 UK retail sales rose nearly three times faster than
expected, while public borrowing also fell. [ID:nUKLJJE638]
Sterling was up 0.2 percent at $1.5628.
 The euro came under pressure in early trade after a report
on the website of German magazine Der Spiegel said austerity
steps to fix Greece's debt were harming the Greek economy.

 MORE BOJ MEASURES?
 The yen slipped as rumours circulated earlier that the Bank
of Japan would hold an emergency policy meeting. Although sources
later said this was unlikely [ID:nTKW007065], market jitters
kept the yen away from 15-year highs versus the dollar.
 ""There was a lot of speculation about whether the BoJ would
hold an emergency meeting. It didn't happen but there is still
tension and nervousness about what action the BoJ could take,""
said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in
Copenhagen.
 Japanese Prime Minister Kan said on Thursday that he would
talk to the country's economics minister and finance minister
along with the ruling Democratic Party's policy chief on the
state of the economy and possible stimulus steps by the end of
August.
 Japan's Sankei newspaper said on Thursday the BOJ has
started considering additional monetary easing steps in line
with government efforts to support the Japanese economy.
[ID:nTOE67H06U]
 Analysts said potential measures may have limited effect in
weakening the yen, while most in the market do not expect
Japanese authorities will intervene directly to curb the yen's
rise unless the dollar falls closer to the 80.00 yen mark.

(Adds comment from French, Russian shipbuilder)
 By Steve Gutterman
 MOSCOW, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Russia will invite bids from
foreign and domestic shipbuilders to build a helicopter-carrier,
broadening its options amid lengthy talks with France that have
not produced a deal, the daily Kommersant said on Thursday.
 Kommersant quoted the president of state-owned United
Shipbuilding Corporation, Roman Trofimenko, as saying the
Defence Ministry plans to hold an open international tender for
the helicopter-carrier.
 Defence Ministry officials could not immediately be reached
for comment. Kommersant cited an unidentified ministry source as
saying that a tender would be held, but the paper said the
Defence Ministry would prefer to buy the ship abroad.
 Russian Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov said in May that
Russia wanted to buy four ships.
 Russia has been trying to improve its war-fighting
capability by acquiring helicopter-carriers, which Moscow has
said would have helped in its August 2008 conflict with Georgia.
 Russia has been in talks to buy the Mistral warship from
France, and President Nicolas Sarkozy told shipyard workers last
month that France would build two of the ships for Russia. A
shipyard executive said at the time that the deal was expected
to be sealed by the end of the year.
 ""France sees no reason to be worried about the current
developments and negotiations are progressing normally in an
excellent manner,"" an Elysee source said on Thursday.
 
 WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY
 Talks have been complicated by Russia's hopes of acquiring
the ship with its weapons technology -- a prospect the commander
of U.S. naval forces in Europe has said would cause concern.
 Serdyukov said in May that Moscow was in preliminary
discussions with Spain and the Netherlands as well. 
 Russian shipbuilders have also expressed interest. United
Shipbuilding Corporation spokesman Igor Ryabov said on Thursday
that three Russian shipbuilders might make bids, two of them in
conjunction with foreign partners.
 Ryabov said a joint venture between Russia and France would
be the best way to build the warship for Russia.
 ""For Russian companies, construction of a modern
helicopter-carrier is important first of all as a process of
learning,"" Interfax quoted him as saying. ""Our shipbuilders will
be learning, filling the gap in some technologies.""
 State-run RIA cited Ryabov as saying the tender would be
announced in September.
 Russia's Baltic Sea neighbours, now NATO members, have
expressed concern about Moscow's efforts to acquire the French
vessel, which can carry up to 900 crew as well as helicopters
and tanks.

prices
 * Templeton's investment in Thailand has risen in past year
 * Mobius says emerging currencies are mostly fairly valued
(Adds details throughout)
 By Viparat Jantraprap
 BANGKOK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Templeton Asset Management's
Mark Mobius said on Thursday he still saw good opportunities in
emerging markets despite rising prices and that he had put more
money into Thai stocks over the past year.
 ""Valuations in emerging markets are in the middle of the
range,"" said Mobius, a prominent emerging markets fund manager
and executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management Ltd in San
Mateo, California.
 ""Things are not so cheap as they were but there are still a
lot of opportunities,"" he said during a speech at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Thailand.
 He said that during the last 25 years the high point for
emerging market companies was about 3 times book value, and the
low point was about 1 times. Valuations are now in the middle
-- about two times book value.
 Thailand had the fifth-biggest weighting of almost 9
percent in Templeton's $37 billion global funds, up from 2
percent five years ago. It ranks behind Brazil, China, India
and Russia.
 Mobius said Templeton had raised its investment in
companies on Thailand's stock market, Southeast Asia's
second-best performing bourse, which has climbed 17 percent
this year.
 He said he liked energy giant PTT, third-largest lender
Kasikornbank, and Siam Cement, the country's biggest industrial
conglomerate.
 He said he also favoured BEC World, and property developer
Land & Houses.
 RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
 Mobius said government policies pose the biggest threat to
the emerging market outlook -- from the risk of tax increases
to trade restrictions. ""We need to keep an eye on that on a
country-by-country basis,"" he said.
 Templeton has expanded into Asia's frontier markets,
including Sri Lanka but expressed caution over Vietnam, citing
investment restrictions and stock market regulations.
 Templeton's frontier funds are valued at about $700
million.
 Mobius said recent rises in emerging market currencies had
put them at fair values.
 ""Generally speaking, the currencies are at the level where
they should be. Although some have lower valuations,"" he said,
though he noted that the Thai baht was slightly undervalued.
 Mobius is optimistic there will not be a double dip
recession in the global economy and that world trade and
production would keep growing.

 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 19 (Reuters) - South African police fired
rubber bullets to disperse crowds blocking roads and healthcare
workers prevented patients from entering hospitals as a strike
by more than 1 million civil servants grew on Thursday.
 The walkout in pursuit of higher wages that started a day
earlier has slowed the treatment of the sick and shut schools
across Africa's largest economy, worrying investors and adding
pressure on the government to reach a deal.
 The finance minister said he did not expect a protracted
strike to have a major economic impact. But analysts have said
the labour action, which includes customs workers, police and
clerks, could slow commerce and trade.
 Crowds in Soweto blocked a main road near a hospital running
through the densely populated area, bringing traffic to a halt
and preventing patients from entering. 
 ""When they refused to move, minimum force had to be used. So
rubber bullets were fired,"" police spokeswoman Captain Nondumiso
Mpantsha said. Water cannon were also deployed and there were
no major injuries, she said.
 Six people, including two infants, died in a Johannesburg
hospital and officials attributed the deaths to the walkout of
medical personnel.
 ""We have been down this road before. Every time there is a
strike, people die,"" a hospital official said on local radio. 
 Troops and army medical personnel have been deployed to
hospitals across South Africa. 
 The unions staged a one-day warning strike last week and
said the action that began on Wednesday kicked off an indefinite
walkout aimed at slowing the government to a halt.
 Analysts expect a deal to be reached in the next few days at
the earliest or by the start of September at the latest. Any
pact is sure to swell state spending as the government tries to
cut its deficit down from 6.7 percent of gross domestic product.
 ""We're not seeing the impact in day-to-day figures, but
certainly it would have an effect on sentiment,"" said Nema
Ramkhelawan, a currency analyst at Rand Merchant Bank.
 
 MONEY PROBLEMS
 Unions, which are set for a fresh round of negotiations on
Friday with the government, are demanding an 8.6 percent pay
rise, more than double the inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($137)
a month for housing.
 Last week the government raised the housing allowance to 700
rand from a previous offer of 630 rand, but refused to increase
its wage rise offer of 7 percent. 
 The housing allowance alone would be equal to about 1
percent of all budget spending and the government has said it
does not have the money to pay more.
 ""We had to make a choice between increasing the salary bill
to unaffordable levels by meeting the union demands and cutting
other urgently needed services,"" the cabinet said in a
statement.
 Adding to the mix was a threat to expand in the coming days
a strike of auto factory workers, who are seeking a 15 percent
wage hike, to the car components sector. The autoworkers' strike
that began last week has slowed production in one of the
country's most important industries.
 The state workers' strike increases pressure on President
Jacob Zuma's ruling African National Congress to reach a deal
with organised labour and appease the party's longstanding union
allies who also have been a reliable source of votes.

 MOSCOW, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Russian grain imports are likely
to soar after the country's worst drought in more than a century
damaged its harvest and forced it to ban exports, analysts said
on Thursday.
 Analysts estimate that Russia, usually a major grain

after the worst drought in more than a century damaged its
harvest, but a report in Vedomosti daily said Russia could
import at least 5 million tonnes of grain this year

to hefty imports.
 ""We currently estimate domestic seasonal grain imports at
2.2 million tonnes as a minimal figure,"" Dmitry Rylko, director
of the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies (IKAR) told
Reuters.
 He expected most of the imports to come from Kazakhstan and
Ukraine, which is also considering curbing exports after its
grain crops were hit by severe frosts and a scorching summer.
 Russia, which was a major grain exporter last year,
imported 94,600 tonnes of wheat, 30,700 tonnes of barley and
38,000 tonnes of maize in the 2009 calendar year, according to
customs data. Kazakhstan and Ukraine were the main suppliers.
 Andrei Sizov Sr., CEO of SovEcon agricultural analysts, told
Reuters Russian grain imports ""may rise to some 1.5 million
tonnes from around 400,000 tonnes this year"".
 Kazakhstan's agriculture ministry said on Thursday it plans
to export 8 million tonnes of grain in the current marketing
year, of which 2 million tonnes would go to Russia, Iran and
other countries.
 Russia's deadly heatwave is estimated to have destroyed a
quarter of its grain crop and could shave $14 billion off this
year's gross domestic product. It has banned grain exports from
Aug 15 until Dec. 31 to curb rising prices.
 Russia's total grain crop is officially expected to reach
60-65 million tonnes, although some analysts believe it may fall
below 60 million tonnes. The 2009 harvest was 97 million tonnes.

 (Recasts with details from proposal)
 By Lisa Jucca
 ZURICH, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Investors other than ordinary
shareholders would take a loss before banks are bailed out by
taxpayers or fail under a new proposal from the Basel Committee
of global banking regulators.
 The proposal, unveiled on Thursday, is part of wide-ranging
measures regulators have been planning to reshape the financial
system and avoid a repeat of the credit crisis that forced
governments to inject hundreds of billions of dollars to shore
up ailing lenders.
 Under the proposal all capital instruments other than common
stocks would could be written-off or converted if a bank is
about to be rescued by the state or about to fail, effectively
hitting capital providers -- such as holders of bonds and
preferred shares -- before ordinary citizens.
 The proposed new clause triggering the write-offs would be
activated at the request of the regulator based in the relevant
jurisdiction.
 The Basel Committee ""believes that a public sector injection
of capital needed to avoid the failure of a bank should not
protect investors in regulatory capital instruments from
absorbing the loss that they would have incurred had the public
sector not chosen to rescue the bank,"" it said in its proposal.
 The plan stems from the realisation that when governments
stepped in to shore up lenders during the credit crisis, they
bailed out both the bank and the capital providers.
 ""As a precondition for being treated as regulatory capital,
an instrument must be capable of bearing a loss if the issuing
bank is unable to support itself in the private market,"" said
Nout Wellink, chairman of the Basel Committee and head of the
Dutch central bank.
 Banks ranging from Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland 
and Lloyds  to ABN AMRO and Fortis in the Netherlands to
Switzerland's UBS  took government cash or were
partly nationalised at the peak of the crisis.
 The Basel Committee proposal goes a step further in trying
to address the too-big-to fail problem, which is still under
discussion in international regulatory circles.
 The proposal, which would require changes in contractual
law, is open for consultation until Oct 1.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a one-week high
on Thursday as an upbeat German growth forecast and optimism on
consumer demand spurred buying in risky assets, while the yen
fell on speculation Japan may ease monetary policy further.
 The Bundesbank said the German economy is set to brow by
around 3 percent this year, better than a previous forecast of
almost 2 percent. Germany registered the fastest expansion since
reunification of 2.2 percent in the second quarter.
 A surge in UK retail sales in July, Wednesday's upbeat sales
forecast from U.S. discounter Target , and favourable
U.S. mortgage data helped boost optimism on consumer spending.
 ""The positive news from the Bundesbank... is giving the
markets a boost on a day where volumes are quite low,"" a
London-based equity trader said.
 MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.3 percent to

half a percent, pointing to a firmer open on Wall Street .
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> gained 0.6 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  gained 0.7 percent on expectations for
strong demand from Asia. German bund futures  fell 30

government debt.
 
 JAPAN'S OPTIONS
 The yen fell 0.2 percent to 85.55 per dollar , after
hitting a 15-year high of 84.72 yen last week.
 The Bank of Japan is lining up its options in case it needs
to ease monetary policy next month. If the BOJ were to ease, the
most likely option would be to offer more cash to the market by
expanding a fixed-rate, cheap loan scheme for banks put in place
in December.
 ""We fully expect additional easing to materialise given
intense political pressure as the government is fully aware that
it has only limited room to provide additional stimulus to

 AMSTERDAM, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The world's largest dredger,
Boskalis Westminster NV, beat first-half earnings forecasts and
improved its outlook after a number of key orders kicked in to
keep its fleet busy.
 Overcapacity has been a major issue in the dredging industry
which is slowly starting to reap the benefits of the budding
economic recovery. Boskalis has taken on pricing pressures by
striving to cut and utilise its fleet better, boosting margins.
 ""Thanks to the well-filled and broadly spread order backlog

 Analysts in a Reuters poll expected total net profit of 88.6
million euros on revenues of 1.09 billion euros.
 ""The main beat was on the margin, which increased 434 basis
points to 16.2 percent, a record-high in dredging, driven by a
strong fleet utilisation, whereas the market had anticipated
pressure on margins due to expected increased overcapacity in
the industry,"" UBS analysts wrote in a note.
 Shares in the Dutch dredger were up 2.1 percent to 33.71
euros at 0723 GMT, making it the strongest performer in
Amsterdam's blue-chip index, which was up 0.3 percent. 
 Boskalis said the profit contribution from Smit was 9.5
million euros, excluding interest expenses on the acquisition
finance but including all other effects of the transaction.
 The result of Smit was lower than in the comparable period
last year as its transport and heavy lift activities were
dragged down by a weaker market for spot contracts, mainly from
the oil and gas industry, Boskalis said. 
 
 OUTLOOK
 Having said as late as May that it expected 2010 net profit
to be lower than in 2009, Boskalis said on Thursday strong
performance would lead to a 10 to 15 percent increase on 2009
net profit. 
 ""If we look at 2010, we have not issued a press release in
which we are saying look out, the market is going to fall out,""
Berdowski told reporters in a conference call, adding the order
book would determine whether 2011 will be as profitable as 2010.
 A drop in oil prices, uncertainty about demand for raw
materials and a flagging economic recovery have made its clients
reluctant to start new projects, the company cautioned, warning
that a quick recovery in the broader market was not foreseen.
 Echoing comments made on Wednesday by shipping and port
groups DP World and A.P. Moller-Maersk, Boskalis said port
freight volumes were recovering, boosting the terminals and
harbour towage operations it acquired with Smit.
 The operating result in the dredging and earthmoving unit,
which engages in the construction and maintenance of ports, land
reclamation and coastal defence, was up 26 percent to 131
million euros even as revenue dropped 0.7 percent.
 Boskalis's maritime infrastructure division, which builds
dams, bridges, quay walls, jetties and oil and gas terminals,
also saw operating income rise despite lower revenue caused by a
delay in the start-up of some projects.
 Boskalis estimates that synergies from its merger with Smit
will amount to 15 to 20 million euros per year and will be
gradually be realized starting in 2011 over a two to three year
period, it said.

 * Pressure mounts to reach a deal
 
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Strikers blocked the
entrances to two hospitals around Johannesburg and teachers
vowed to blockade a main highway as a stoppage by more than 1
million civil servants expanded on its second day on Thursday.
 The strike for higher wages has slowed the treatment of the
sick and shut schools across South Africa, adding pressure on
the government to reach a deal.
 A union representing 200,000 workers planned to join the
work stoppage that began on Wednesday among a coalition of
unions that represent over 1 million civil servants.
 The strike was not expected to have any immediate impact on
Africa's largest economy but a prolonged work stoppage could
slow commerce at home and trade abroad. 
 The groups staged a one-day warning strike last week and
said the action that began on Wednesday was the start of an
indefinite strike aimed at grinding the government to a halt.
 Analysts expect a deal to be reached in the next few days at
the earliest or by the start of September at the latest, with
any agreement certain to swell state spending as the government
tries to bring its deficit down from 6.7 percent of gross
domestic product.
 Unions are demanding an 8.6 percent pay rise, more than
double the inflation rate, and 1,000 rand ($137) for housing.
 Last week the government offered to increase a monthly
housing allowance to 700 rand from a previous offer of 630 rand,
but refused to increase its wage rise offer of 7 percent.
 The housing allowance alone would be equal to about 1
percent of all government spending.
 The strike increases pressure on President Jacob Zuma's
ruling African National Congress to reach a deal with organised
labour and appease the party's longstanding union allies who
also have been a reliable source of votes. 
 But pressure will also mount on unions to reach a deal as
rank and file members lose pay from being off the job and some
look favourably on the government's offer. 
 Public opinion could turn against the unions if a prolonged
work stoppage forces parents to find day care for their
children, delays treatment at hospitals and slows paperwork at
government agencies.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday
on hopes that a surge in U.S. mortgage applications will shore
up a faltering recovery, while the yen hobbled on reports that
the central bank was considering steps to contain its
export-sapping rise.
 European stock markets rose in early with major shares up
0.3 percent <.FTEU3>, following a positive finish on Wall
Street and gains in Japan's Nikkei <.N225> which closed up 1.32
percent.
 The markets were looking for further cues from the weekly
U.S. jobless claims and British retail sales due later on
Thursday, seeking evidence that an economic recovery was
continuing apace.
 ""The whole world is sort of holding its breath to see what
happens especially in the States, if consumption picks up,
though you have to wonder if that's a good thing. There are
lots of open-ended questions, that's the problem,"" said Alex
Boggis at Aberdeen Asset Management.
 U.S. growth slowed in the second quarter, sparking fears
the country might suffer a double-dip recession after climbing
out of the worst economic slump since the Great Depression.
 A jump in mortgage applications with demand for home
refinancing at their highest level in 15 months and sales
forecast from discounter Target Corp boosted hopes of stronger
economic growth, lifting Wall Street overnight.
 Shares in Asia outside of Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> picked up
the thread, advancing 0.75 percent, helped by demand for
consumer stocks reflecting Asia's stronger economic growth
compared with other regions. The MSCI ex-Japan sub-index of
consumer discretionary stocks was up 1.3 percent, taking its
gains for the year to date to nearly 11 percent.
 Seoul shares rose for a third straight session on Thursday
to end above a key support level as investors snapped up stocks
such as Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> and Hynix <000660.KS> on
subsiding economic worries.
 The Indian bourse also pulled up the MSCI index with shares
climbing 0.8 percent to 30-month highs on robust domestic
growth and firm global markets.
 But traders said the market was vulnerable to a correction
with valuations running high, even though the economy, Asia's
third largest, is expected to expand 8.5 percent this year, the
fastest pace among major economies after China.
 JAPAN OUTPERFORMS, YEN WEIGHS
Japan's benchmark Nikkei <.N225> rose 122.14 points to
9,362.68, buoyed by short-covering and bargain-hunting by
domestic investors after falls earlier this week, but the yen's
overall strength against the dollar capped further gains.
 ""The Nikkei remains at a precarious level. If U.S. stocks
were to slide on some negative news again, the index could
easily go below 9,000,"" said Kenichi Hirano, operating officer
at Tachibana Securities.
 Investors wait for a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto
Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa.
 A newspaper report triggered speculation that the central
bank may ease monetary policy further ahead of the meeting,
which is expected to take place on Monday.
 However, sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking later
said the central bank was lining up its options for its policy
meeting early next month, but was in no rush to act now.
[ID:nTOE67H06U]
 The most likely option under consideration is expanding the
BOJ's fund-supply tool introduced in December, Japan's Sankei
newspaper said, without citing sources. The December move
helped push down money market rates and subsequently weaken the
yen after it hit a 14-year high.
 The dollar, appeared to draw some strength from the
newspaper report, edging up 0.3 percent to 85.74 yen ,
pulling away from a 15-year low of 84.72 hit last week.
 The euro slipped after a report on the website of German
newspaper Der Spiegel that austerity steps to fix Greece's debt
problems are damaging its economy, but falls in the euro were
seen limited as the report provided few fresh insights.
[ID:nTOE67I00Q]
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2805  and support for
it is seen at the 100-day moving average of $1.2776, while
rises could be capped around $1.2900, said a trader at a
Japanese bank. The Australian dollar drifted lower on
Thursday, as some market players saw uncertainty over the
country's election as an excuse to sell into recent gains amid
cautious support for risky trades as equities struggled.
 Oil was under pressure on Thursday from a stronger dollar
and brimming U.S. petroleum inventories, after prices rebounded
from a six-week low a day earlier with rising stock markets.
U.S. crude for September  dipped 11 cents to $75.31 a
barrel, after touching $73.83 on Wednesday, the lowest price
since July 7.
U.S. commercial crude and product inventories rose last week
to the highest level since the U.S. government began tracking
weekly data, statistics showed, a sign fuel supply is outpacing
demand amid a slow U.S. economic recovery.
 Gold gained on Thursday after holdings in SPDR Gold Trust
 rose again, showing that the safe-haven appeal of the
metal remained intact amid volatile equities markets.
 Spot gold  added $1.35 an ounce to $1,228.90 an ounce
by 0052 GMT. It had rallied to $1,232.35 an ounce on Wednesday,
its strongest since early July, on technical buying and strong
physical demand.

 * Watches are top gaining sector among exports
 * Exports rise by real 2.2 pct y/y in July
 
 ZURICH, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Switzerland's trade surplus rose
to a record high in July and exports rose year-on-year, data
showed on Thursday, thanks to buoyant overseas markets and in
defiance of a stronger currency.
 Exports from Switzerland rose by a real 2.2 percent in July
to 16.776 billion Swiss francs ($13.32 billion), the Federal
Customs Office said. Overall Switzerland ran a merchandise trade
surplus of 2.886 billion Swiss francs, its biggest ever, the
office said.
 The Swiss franc, which investors regard as a safe haven,
rallied more than 10 percent against the euro in the first six
months of the year, prompting some to caution exports could
suffer.
 The euro zone is Switzerland's biggest trading partner. Last
week data showed Germany's economy grew by 2.2 percent in the
second quarter -- its fastest quarterly expansion since
reunification. [ID:nLDE67C0AI]
 ""I expect that in the third quarter things will continue to
be strong. If you look at German GDP figures, how exports are
booming in Germany, we can expect that Swiss exports will
continue to be strong,"" ZKB economist David Marmet said.
 ""Most Swiss companies produce technologically sophisticated
goods and they have long-term contracts, so the exchange rate
doesn't play so much of a role short-term.""
 The customs office said the rise in exports was chiefly due
to extra-European growth. Watches posted a nominal 19.9 percent
increase, followed by metals and precision instruments.
 Watch exports to Hong Kong, the most important market for
Swiss watches, rose 55 percent.
 June's trade balance was revised to 1.71 billion francs and
exports were revised to 17.254 billion francs.

that is a key portal with isolated neighbour North Korea has
launched a pilot scheme to settle export deals in China's yuan
currency, the city's official newspaper said on Thursday.
 North Korea's struggling economy has come under greater
strain after a chaotic attempt to re-denominate its currency
last year hurt private traders and alarmed Chinese merchants.
 The yuan's trial use appears intended to boost Chinese
exporters' confidence in doing more above-the-table deals with
the North, often a perilous gamble even in smoother times.
 Many Chinese traders doing business with the North already
use the yuan, dollar, euro in cash or even barter to settle
export of food, clothes, appliances and other cheap goods in
often informal or convoluted transactions. Smuggling and
illicit deals are common along the border, marked by the Yalu
River, a few dozen metres (feet) wide in many parts.
 The Dandong Daily reported that approved exporters in
Dandong will be able officially to carry out business in yuan.
 The Chinese government announced in June that all of its
trading partners would be able to invoice and settle imports
and exports in yuan, but so far such transactions have been
primarily confined to trade between China and Hong Kong.
 ""This means that state-designated export businesses in
Dandong that engage in external trade can use the renminbi to
settle transactions,"" said the Chinese-language Dandong Daily
(www.ddrb.cn) of the scheme, which began on Wednesday.
 The renminbi is another name for the yuan.
 ""This will reduce exchange rate risks and the costs of
doing business, and smooth out enjoying export tax rebate
policies, as well as improving capital utilisation,"" said the
report.
 The scheme will also cover approved small-scale exports
passing through customs posts at Dandong, it said.
 The new scheme will allow exporters to enjoy rebates and
other benefits for trade, but will also depend on North Korean
importers being allowed to deal legally in yuan.
 Dandong lies on the Yalu, and at night its neon-lit
riverfront faces the darkness of the electricity-starved North.
 In June, North Korean border guards shot dead three Chinese
nationals suspected of smuggling across the border near
Dandong, prompting a rare public dressing down of Pyongyang by
Beijing.
 On Wednesday, Chinese authorities said an aircraft that
crashed in northeast China might have flown from North Korea,
though the incident is unlikely to hurt ties.
 North Korea's dependence on Chinese goods and aid has
deepened as Pyongyang's ties with South Korea have frayed.
 According to Chinese customs data, in the first six months
of 2010, China's trade with North Korea was worth $1.3 billion,
a rise of 15.2 percent on the same time last year.
 China's exports to the North grew by a quarter, but its
imports fell by 4.8 percent, the customs data show. As much as
70-80 percent of that trade passed through Dandong, according
to earlier Chinese news reports, citing local customs
officials.

 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up against the yen
on Thursday with investors reluctant to chase the yen higher as
they waited to see if the Bank of Japan or the government will
take new steps to rein in the yen's rise.
 Earlier, rumours had circulated in the market that the BOJ
would hold an emergency policy meeting at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT). That
followed a media report that the central bank had started
considering additional monetary easing steps.
 The dollar briefly pared its gains against the yen after
sources familiar with the matter said the Bank of Japan is highly
unlikely to hold an emergency meeting on Thursday.
 But the dollar remained firm against the yen due to
short-covering, traders said.
 Investors are watching to see if the Japanese central bank or
the government will take new steps to rein in the yen's
export-sapping rise ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister
Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected
next Monday.
 The Sankei newspaper said on Thursday that the BOJ has
started considering additional monetary easing steps in line with
government efforts to support the country's economy.
 The most likely option under consideration is expanding the
BOJ's fund-supply tool put in place in December, the Sankei said
without citing sources.
 The central bank may either expand the fund supply volume to
30 trillion yen ($352 billion) from 20 trillion yen, or extend
the duration of cheap, fixed-rate loans to banks to six months
from three months, the paper said.
 ""Such steps by the BOJ may help to spur dollar short-covering
against the yen. But it would be difficult to change the yen's
firm trend,"" said Tomohiro Nishida, treasury department manager
at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 85.74 yen, pulling away from a
15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading platform EBS last week.
 ""If the BOJ announces only what the report is saying it's
likely to disappoint the market. And there's a possibility the
yen may even appreciate further,"" said Yuji Saito, director at
Credit Agricole's foreign exchange department.
 WATCHING THE CENTRAL BANK
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated on Thursday
that he is continuing to watch foreign exchange moves carefully.
 Japanese authorities are seen unlikely to conduct yen-selling
intervention, however, unless the yen's rise accelerates sharply,
market players say.
 The euro slipped after a report on the website of German
newspaper Der Spiegel that austerity steps to fix Greece's debt
trouble are damaging its economy, but falls in the euro were seen
limited as the report provided few fresh incentives.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2805 and support for it is
seen at the 100-day moving average of $1.2776, while rises could
be capped around $1.2900, said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent against the yen to 109.78 yen
after touching a seven-week low of 109.07 yen on EBS earlier this
week.
 Japanese investors bought a net 2.18 trillion yen ($25.6
billion) of foreign debt in the week of Aug. 8-14, the largest
volume of purchases since the finance ministry started to gather
its weekly capital flows data in January 2005.
 A source familiar with the data said Japanese banks have been
aggressively buying overseas debt, boosting the net buying
figure. But banks' hefty purchases of foreign bonds are not seen
helping to rein in recent gains in the yen because banks hedge
against foreign exchange volatility when they buy bonds abroad or
raise funds overseas to finance their purchases, the source said.
 Banks' buying of U.S. government debt is likely to have
contributed to a fall in Treasury yields and to have been more of
a negative factor for dollar/yen, some analysts say.
 The pair's moves have recently had a strong correlation with
U.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads, which have narrowed
as U.S. treasury yields fell sharply over the past few months.

(Recasts with changes in lead, adds details)
 TOKYO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is lining up its
options in case it needs to ease monetary policy next month but
is in no mood to act now, sources said, despite speculation the
strong yen may nudge it to act before its September rate review.
 Rumours that the BOJ would hold an emergency meeting on
Thursday pushed the dollar higher against the yen and sent bond
yields lower, but the moves later reversed after sources said the
central bank was highly unlikely to meet so soon.
 Markets are rife with speculation that the BOJ, in an attempt
to pre-empt government pressure for action, may loosen its
already-easy monetary policy at an emergency meeting before or
shortly after a meeting expected on Monday between Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa and Prime Minister Naoto Kan.
 But the central bank is unlikely to act at least until its
next regular policy meeting on Sept. 6-7, unless the yen heads
towards its all-time high beyond 80 to the dollar at a pace of 2
to 3 yen in a single day, sources said.
 ""Markets seem to believe the BOJ may ease policy before
Shirakawa meets Kan, or that Shirakawa will promise to ease
policy when the two meet. I think that's unlikely,"" said Yasuhide
Yajima, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
 ""If the yen shoots up again and stock prices fall, the BOJ
may ease policy as early as in September, more likely in October.
If so, it would need to come up with something aggressive enough
to convince markets that it's determined to fight deflation.""
 The government is considering a package of stimulus measures
to support the economy, which may include extending the deadline
for subsidies for energy-efficient consumer electronics,
according to Japanese media.
 But with the outline of the government measures sketchy, the
BOJ is not buckling to pressure at least for now, analysts say.
 If the BOJ were to ease policy in September, the most likely
option would be to offer more cash to the market by expanding a
fixed-rate, cheap loan scheme for banks put in place in December,
they say.
 The Sankei newspaper said on Thursday the BOJ has started
considering additional monetary easing steps in line with
government efforts to support the economy. The paper did not cite
sources and did not specify when the BOJ would actually move.
 The dollar rose to 85.80 yen on the rumours of an emergency
BOJ meeting but trimmed gains to around 85.60 yen after sources
said such a meeting looked unlikely.
 The benchmark 10-year government bond yield fell to 0.905
percent on the rumour, near a seven-year trough of 0.900 percent
hit on Wednesday, before pulling back to 0.920 percent.

see exactly what the authorities might do.
 ""If the BOJ announces only what the report is saying, it is

 The dollar rose 0.2 percent compared with late U.S. trade on

the upside is heavy around $1.2900, a trader at a Japanese bank
said.
 The euro was little changed against the Japanese currency at
109.82 yen, after touching a seven-week low of 109.07 yen on EBS
earlier this week.
 Japanese investors bought a net 2.18 trillion yen ($25.6
billion) of foreign debt in the August 8-14 week, the largest

 Japanese investors have been net buyers of foreign bonds for
14 straight weeks, picking up 14.52 trillion yen ($170.2
billion).
 Japanese have bought a net 16.37 trillion of overseas debt so
far this year, already exceeding last year's total net buying of
12.13 trillion yen.

stocks was up 1.3 percent, taking its gains for the year to
date to nearly 11 percent.
 Seoul shares rose for a third straight session on Thursday
to end above a key support level as investors snapped up stocks
such as Hyundai Motor and Hynix on subsiding economic worries.
 The Indian bourse also pulled up the MSCI index with shares
climbing 0.8 percent to 30-month highs on robust domestic
growth and firm global markets.
 But traders said the market was vulnerable to a correction
with valuations running high, even though the economy, Asia's
third largest, is expected to expand 8.5 percent this year, the
fastest pace among major economies after China.
 JAPAN OUTPERFORMS, YEN WEIGHS
Japan's benchmark Nikkei rose 122.14 points to 9,362.68,
buoyed by short-covering and bargain-hunting by domestic
investors after falls earlier this week, but the yen's overall
strength against the dollar capped further gains.
 ""The Nikkei remains at a precarious level. If U.S. stocks
were to slide on some negative news again, the index could
easily go below 9,000,"" said Kenichi Hirano, operating officer
at Tachibana Securities.
 Investors wait for a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto
Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa.
 A newspaper report triggered speculation that the central
bank may ease monetary policy further ahead of the meeting,
which is expected to take place on Monday.
 However, sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking later
said the central bank was lining up its options for its policy
meeting early next month, but was in no rush to act now.
 The most likely option under consideration is expanding the
BOJ's fund-supply tool introduced in December, Japan's Sankei
newspaper said, without citing sources. The December move
helped push down money market rates and subsequently weaken the
yen after it hit a 14-year high.
 The dollar, appeared to draw some strength from the
newspaper report, edging up 0.3 percent to 85.74 yen, pulling
away from a 15-year low of 84.72 hit last week.
 The euro slipped after a report on the website of German
newspaper Der Spiegel that austerity steps to fix Greece's debt
problems are damaging its economy, but falls in the euro were
seen limited as the report provided few fresh insights.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2805 and support for it is
seen at the 100-day moving average of $1.2776, while rises
could be capped around $1.2900, said a trader at a Japanese
bank. The Australian dollar drifted lower on Thursday, as
some market players saw uncertainty over the country's election
as an excuse to sell into recent gains amid cautious support
for risky trades as equities struggled.
 Oil was under pressure on Thursday from a stronger dollar
and brimming U.S. petroleum inventories, after prices rebounded
from a six-week low a day earlier with rising stock markets.
U.S. crude for September dipped 11 cents to $75.31 a barrel,
after touching $73.83 on Wednesday, the lowest price since July
7.
U.S. commercial crude and product inventories rose last week
to the highest level since the U.S. government began tracking
weekly data, statistics showed, a sign fuel supply is outpacing
demand amid a slow U.S. economic recovery.
 Gold gained on Thursday after holdings in SPDR Gold Trust
rose again, showing that the safe-haven appeal of the metal
remained intact amid volatile equities markets.
 Spot gold added $1.35 an ounce to $1,228.90 an ounce by
0052 GMT. It had rallied to $1,232.35 an ounce on Wednesday,
its strongest since early July, on technical buying and strong
physical demand.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Japanese shares rose on
Thursday, outperforming the rest of Asia, and the dollar held
steady on a report that the Bank of Japan was considering new
monetary easing measures to weaken the yen's export-sapping
rise.
 With a mixed performance overnight on overseas markets
offering few cues, shares moved in a narrow range across the
region as investors, particularly in Japan, picked up stocks on
dips.

the gut-wrenching could continue for awhile,"" Randy Frederick,

a note.
 The MSCI share index for Asia excluding Japan was up 0.1,
held down by tech-heavy Taiwan, where investors waited for GDP
figures later in the day worried that demand might slow down,
and Australia dragged lower by global miner BHP Billiton
 following its hostile takeover bid for Canada's Potash
Corp .
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei <.N225> rose 1 percent to
9335.24, prompting talk that pension funds were picking up
cheap stocks after the index hit an eight-month closing low
this week. The gains remained limited, though, by the yen's
strength.
 ""The Nikkei remains at a precarious level. If U.S. stocks
were to slide on some negative news again, the index could

 ""If the BOJ announces only what the report is saying, it is
likely to disappoint the market. And there is a possibility
that the yen may even appreciate further,"" said Yuji Saito,
director at Credit Agricole's foreign exchange department.
 The euro dipped 0.3 percent to 109.50 yen ,
edging back towards a seven week low of 109.07 yen hit on EBS
earlier this week.
 Japanese government bonds were little changed on Thursday
as a wait-and-see mood prevailed with prospects of further
monetary easing by the Bank of Japan mostly priced in after an
extensive rally that has taken yields to seven-year lows.

 * Report lends support to dollar/yen
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The dollar held steady against the
yen on Thursday above a 15-year low hit last week, drawing some
support from a media report that the Bank of Japan has started
considering additional monetary easing measures.
 The most likely option under consideration is expanding the
BOJ's fund-supply tool put in place in December, Japan's Sankei
newspaper said, without citing sources.
 The central bank may either expand the the fund supply amount
to 30 trillion yen ($352 billion) from the current 20 trillion
yen, or extend the duration of cheap, fixed-rate loans to banks
to six months from the present three months, the paper said.
 The report weighed on the yen somewhat but the overall
reaction was limited as investors remained cautious until they
see exactly what the authorities might do.
 ""If the BOJ announces only what the report is saying, it is
likely to disappoint the market. And there is a possibility that
the yen may even appreciate further,"" said Yuji Saito, director
at Credit Agricole's foreign exchange department.
 The dollar was little changed from late U.S. trading on
Wednesday at 85.48 yen, up from the day's low of 85.34 yen and
staying above a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading platform
EBS last week.
 ""Such steps by the BOJ may help spur dollar short-covering
against the yen. But it would be difficult to change the yen's
firm trend,"" said Tomohiro Nishida, treasury department manager
at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.
 The euro dipped 0.3 percent to 109.50 yen, edging back
towards a seven week low of 109.07 yen hit on EBS earlier this
week.
 Against the dollar, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2813.
 Investors are watching whether the Japanese central bank or
the government will take new steps to rein in the yen's
export-sapping rise ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister
Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected
next Monday.
 Japanese authorities seem unlikely to conduct yen-selling
intervention, however, unless the yen's rise accelerates sharply,

 * US says issues can be resolved, but no deal this week
 * 11th round of talks already expected for September
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - A long-running battle over
the right to use European place names, like Parma or Roquefort,
for some of the world's most popular foods and beverages looks
to be the toughest remaining issue in international trade talks
aimed at reducing copyright and trademark theft.
 The 27-nations of the European Union want the proposed
Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) to cover
""geographical indicators"", which are names for food and
alcoholic products drawn from a particular location, such
Champagne or Cognac, both in France.
 But U.S. business groups worry that the EU demand would
mean American products as commonplace as Kraft parmesan cheese
could potentially be treated as illegal items under the pact
and subject to seizure by customs officials.
 ""Yes, that is a possible concern,"" said Nefeterius
Mcpherson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's
office, which is hosting the 10th round of talks this week on
the proposed pact.
 Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand and
Switzerland also are taking part in the talks, which President
Barack Obama has heralded as a key element of the U.S. strategy
for fighting the global trade in fake goods. Trade in such
goods has been estimated at more than $200 billion a year.
 U.S. movie, music, software and other copyright-based
industries calculate they lose more than $16 billion in sales
each year from pirated versions of their products sold around
the world.
 Last month, after the ninth round of ACTA negotiations,
European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht complained
that other countries were unwilling to include designs or
geographical indicators within the scope of the pact and warned
that was something the EU must have.
 The EU has also pressed in the nine-year-old Doha round of
world trade talks for tougher protections for geographical
indicators, against stiff resistance from Washington.
The United States recognizes geographical indicators that
have been trademarked, but not the full gamut of food and
beverage names the EU wants to protect.
 A key feature of ACTA would mandate that customs officials
have ""ex officio"" authority to seize counterfeit goods without
a request from the rights holders or a court order.
 The EU wants that to apply to geographical indicators as
well, creating concern among U.S. businesses that legitimate
American products could be caught in another ACTA member's
customs net.
 Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Miriam Sapiro stressed the
points of agreement among the 37 participating countries on
Monday at the start of this week's talks.
 ""All of the governments in the room today are here because
we share a commitment to effective enforcement of intellectual
property rights ... And we share the persistence to complete
this effort,"" Sapiro said.
 In that vein, USTR spokeswoman McPherson said the United
States believes differences about the scope of the agreement
""are resolvable"" even though the talks won't finish this week
and an 11th round is already set for September in Japan.
 The potential for the talks to drag on worries some
business groups, which hope ACTA will protect U.S. jobs and
profits by improving cooperation and coordination among member
countries on enforcing intellectual property rights.
 ""We hope the negotiators will quickly be able to resolve
all outstanding issues - including those related to the scope
of the agreement - so that they can move towards the
implementation phase of this important agreement,"" said Rob
Calia, senior director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's
anti-counterfeiting and piracy program.

 * Oil falls on high U.S. inventories
 * Target forecast revives U.S. consumer shares
(Updates with U.S. close)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - World stocks scratched out
gains on Wednesday after a forecast from U.S. retailer Target
Corp aided the consumer outlook in a field of tepid earnings,
while energy shares fell as crude oil prices were pressured by
a disappointing industry report.
 The euro fell, surrendering early gains against the dollar
after a German government bond auction attracted solid demand,
easing concern about fiscal instability in the European Union.
 Oil prices pared losses after a government report showed
U.S. crude stocks last week fell less than analysts had
expected. That report undercut some of the pressure on prices
after the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday showed a
rise in crude stocks last week.
 Wall Street managed to build on Tuesday's rally of more
than 1 percent as investors grappling with the direction of the
economy assessed the latest corporate earnings.
 Retailers were again in focus. Target  reported weak
same-store sales but its shares recovered after the company
said it sees third-quarter same-store sales rising by 1 to 3
percent.
 Declining energy shares and lackluster earnings kept gains
in check. The S&P 500 index was also trading around its 50-day
moving average, struggling to break it decisively. The 50-day
average is currently around 1,088.
 The inability to push through that level with conviction is
illustrative of an unenthusiastic market as investors reassess
their outlook on the economy, said Kurt Brunner, portfolio
manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
 ""You don't have the energy to push it through and that
might take a little while,"" Brunner said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 9.69 points,
or 0.09 percent, to 10,415.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> edged higher by 1.62 points to 1,094.16 and the Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 6.26 points to 2,215.70.
 Also on Wednesday, warehouse club operator BJ's Wholesale
Club Inc  missed profit expectations, sending its shares
down 2.7 percent at $42.14. Target  gained 2.5 percent
to $51.95.
 With consumer spending typically accounting for about
two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, retailers have come under
heavy scrutiny by investors.
 In other earnings, Deere & Co , the maker of
construction, forestry and agricultural equipment, beat
estimates, but said sales were ""far below normal levels"" and
pointed to deteriorating conditions in Europe. Deere lost 1.9
percent to $65.98. [ID:nN18179869]
 Shares of global miner BHP Billiton 
remained in focus, falling more than 3.4 percent in London on
concerns that it may have to overpay for fertilizer group
Potash Corp after the Canadian firm rejected an initial
takeover offer.
 In Europe the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed
down 0.4 percent, pressured by energy stocks.
 U.S. crude for September delivery  fell 50 cents to
$75.27 a barrel. Oil is down around 4 percent this month.
 World shares as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> and
Thomson Reuters <.TRXFLDGLPU> eked out gains of less than 0.1
percent. Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up about 0.9 percent.
 Traders warned against reading too much into market moves
at the moment.
 ""The market is still rangebound. There is no conviction at
the moment, and this will go on until September when investors
come back from holiday,"" said Alexandre Le Drogoff, technical
analyst at Aurel BGC in Paris.
 The dollar endured selling pressure against the yen, easing
toward recent 15-year lows on growing speculation that Japanese
authorities are unlikely to intervene to counter their
currency's recent strong run.
 The euro recovered from the day's low after a 5 billion
euro sale of German 10-year debt produced a record-low average
yield of 2.37 percent, but failed to hold above key levels.
 The euro declined 0.18 percent at $1.2856 .
 ""There is currently not enough fundamentally positive news
out of Europe to drive the euro beyond 1.2900 on a sustained
basis,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief analyst at FX Solutions in
Saddle River, New Jersey.
 The dollar shed 0.16 percent against the yen to 85.39 yen
, not far from a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading
platform EBS last week.
 U.S. Treasury bond prices dipped as equities rose.
 In light of Wednesday's modest pullback, investors and
analysts are divided whether the summer rally in bonds is
coming to end.
 Statistical measures such as relative strength index
signaled Treasuries remain overbought.
 ""I view the great bull market in bonds to be approaching a
speculative blow-off, and I am increasingly of the view that
shorting the U.S. bond market will be the trade of the decade,""
wrote Doug Kass, a fund manager at Seabreeze Partners in Palm
Beach, Florida, in a note to clients.
 But there is little evidence that investors are willing to
trim their bond holdings any time soon as the economic recovery
appears vulnerable, some analysts said.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  last traded
down 1/32 to 99-25/32, near its session low. Its yield was last
2.64 percent, flat from late on Tuesday and below a 17-month
low of 2.56 percent set two days ago.
 The 30-year bond bucked the downtrend to rise 18/32 in
price to yield 3.74 percent after touching a 16-month mow of
3.68 percent earlier.
 Gold  rose $6.24, or 0.51 percent, to $1,229.10.

 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Wednesday, surrendering early gains after again
failing to hold above a key psychological level.
 The dollar came under fresh selling pressure against the
yen, moving toward recent 15-year lows on growing speculation
that Japanese authorities are unlikely to intervene to counter
their currency's recent strong run.
 The euro had risen earlier in the day after a German
government bond auction attracted solid demand, easing concerns
about fiscal instability in the European Union. But in a
continuation of a trend seen over the last five days, the euro
failed to hold above $1.2900.
 ""We haven't been able to trade clearly above that $1.29
mark in just over a week or so. What you're seeing is once it
does break above $1.29, people are taking the opportunity to
sell the currency and take a little profit,"" said John Doyle,
senior currency strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
""We're still pretty bearish on the euro.""
 In late trading, the euro was down slightly at $1.2858
, trading in a range between $1.2824 and $1.2923,
according to Reuters data.
 The euro was supported at around $1.2845, the 50 percent
retracement of the single currency's fall from its March 17
high to its four-year low struck on June 7.
 Giving the euro some support was a 5 billion euro sale of
German 10-year debt that produced a record-low average yield of
2.37 percent. An auction of Portuguese T-bills also went
smoothly. For details, see [ID:nLDE67H0Q1] [ID:nLIS002444]
 The euro had recovered from this week's low of $1.2732 on
robust responses to Irish and Spanish government debt auctions,
although investors remain cautious about going long on the
currency amid worries about peripheral euro zone economies.
 ""There is currently not enough fundamentally positive news
out of Europe to drive the euro beyond 1.2900 on a sustained

604,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2010 03:36PM ET</span>",French milk farmers strike price deal," PARIS, Aug 18 (Reuters) - French dairy farmers have struck a
deal with their large customers on increasing the price of milk
for the third quarter of the year, defusing tensions in a sector
that saw mass protests by producers last year.
 Under the terms of the deal, the price of milk will rise by
about 11 percent compared to the same period last year,
Christele Josse, the head of the national federation of milk
cooperatives (FNCL), told Reuters.
 The parties also agreed to put in place a mechanism for
monitoring differences in competitiveness between the French and
German markets, a step which should facilitate future price
negotiations.
 French dairy farmers staged a delivery boycott roughly one
year ago, dumping millions of litres of milk after a drop in
prices they said threatened their livelihood. The protest was
suspended after EU farm ministers agreed to offer extra support
for the sector.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is likely to face mass
demonstrations against his pension reform plans starting next
month, welcomed the deal, which wards off the threat of
additional protests from milk producers.
 ""It will allow the price of milk paid to producers to rise
in a fair manner over the course of 2010,"" he said in a
statement.
 Sarkozy said he hoped the deal would set the stage for a
balanced new long-term contract between dairy farmers and their
clients from 2011.

output by a small fraction, a ""modest"" price to pay for greater
stability, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said,
dismissing lenders' warnings that they may curb growth severely.
 The new ""Basel III"" rules for banks' capital and liquidity
will tighten lending and reduce investment during a transition
period, but to a much lower degree than forecast by banks, Basel
and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) said on Wednesday.
 ""Macroeconomic costs of implementing stronger standards are
manageable, ... while the longer-term benefits to financial
stability and more stable economic growth are substantial,"" FSB
Chairman Mario Draghi said in the statement.
 Assuming the rules are phased in over four years and banks'
capital levels rise by 2 percentage points, output would on
average decline by 0.38 percent compared to a baseline scenario,
according to an analysis by the FSB, a body tasked by the G20 to
coordinate a string of market reforms including Basel III.
 This is only an eighth of the 3.1 percent output loss over
five years due to Basel III and other measures which bank lobby
group The Institute of International Finance (IIF) has predicted
for the United States, the euro zone and Japan.
 The Bank of Canada said the new rules would benefit Canada's
economy significantly from reduced likelihood of fallout from
foreign financial crises. It saw gains even with conservative
benefit assumptions and the most extreme cost estimates.
 Once banks have completed the switch, the new rules will
help avoid or at least moderate the boom-and-bust cycles which
first pump too much capital into the wrong places and then cause
huge output losses when the bubble bursts, Basel said.
 Eliminating savage downturns such as that seen after the
2008 financial crisis could in the long-term add as much as 1.8
percent economic growth per year, Basel said in a second study
trying to gauge the long-term benefits of the new rules.
 ""Economic benefits of the proposed reforms are substantial
and need to be considered alongside the analysis of the costs,""
said Basel Chairman Nout Wellink.
 ""These benefits result not only from a stronger banking
system in the long run, but also from greater confidence in the
stability of the financial system as soon as implementation
starts,"" he said.

 The Basel Committee of global banking supervisors published
a draft Basel III reform last December that would force banks to
hold more and better quality capital to withstand future shocks
without taxpayer help again.
 It eased some of the original proposals and said banks would
have more time to comply in a revision last month that addressed
some concerns banks have raised.
 The G20, which is spearheading the reform, is set to endorse
the complete Basel III package in November with implementation
starting from the end of 2012.
 
 LONGER PHASE-IN EASES HIT
 The Basel and FSB reports corroborate the view that a longer
phase-in of the new rules is needed to avoid scuppering the
fledgling recovery of the world economy, especially as major
economies enter a period of budget austerity.
 ""A longer transition period could substantially mitigate the
impact, allowing banks additional time to adapt by retaining
earnings, issuing equity, shifting liability composition and the
like,"" the FSB said in its assessment of the transition.
 Basel and the FSB said the banks' assessment of the impact
of the new rules was over-dramatic because it assumed banks will
return to pre-crisis levels for return on equity, and because it
compared the impact to pre-crisis debt-bubble practices that
were unlikely to return even without new regulation.
 A crucial question yet to be answered on Basel III is what
minimum level of capital banks will be required to hold in the
new system, and what this new regulatory minimum will mean for
the -- usually higher -- level markets expect.
 Another impact study that has not been published yet by
Basel will calculate where banks' current capital levels are if
the new, stricter rules are applied, and what this means for the
new level and for capital-raising needs.
 Regulatory sources have told Reuters that Basel is likely to
require banks to hold 6 to 8 percent of core Tier 1 capital
including a ""capital conservation buffer"", and in addition to
have another 2 percent ""countercyclical buffer"".
 While countries are broadly in agreement on the need for
tougher guidelines but divided on the degree. Britain and the
United States have argued for a higher core Tier 1 ratio while
Japan, France and Germany have pushed for less stringent rules.
 The IIF has said banks in the three key economic areas would
need to raise $700 billion of common equity and issue $5.4
trillion of long-term wholesale debt in the next five years to
meet the expected new capital and liquidity requirements.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - World stocks struggled to hold
a positive trend on Wednesday after tepid earnings reports from
some big U.S. companies and energy shares fell as crude oil
prices were pressured by a disappointing industry report.
 The euro fell, surrendering early gains against the dollar
after a German government bond auction attracted solid demand,
easing concern about fiscal instability in the European Union.
 Oil prices pared losses after a government report showed
U.S. crude stocks last week fell less than analysts had
expected. That report undercut some of the pressure on prices
after the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday showed a
rise in crude stocks last week.
 On Wall Street, shares eased a day after rallying more than
1 percent, as investors grappling with the direction of the
economy assessed the latest corporate earnings.
 Retailers were again in focus. Discounter Target Corp.
reported weak same-store sales but its shares recovered after
the company said it sees third-quarter same-store sales rising
by 1 to 3 percent.
 However, declining energy shares and lackluster earnings
kept gains in check. The S&P 500 index was also trading around
its 50-day moving average, struggling to break it decisively.
The 50-day average is currently around 1,088.
 The inability to push through that level with conviction is
illustrative of an unenthusiastic market as investors reassess
their outlook on the economy, said Kurt Brunner, portfolio
manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
 ""You don't have the energy to push it through and that
might take a little while,"" Brunner said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 10.93 points,
or 0.11 percent, to 10,394.92. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> eased 0.42 point to 1,092.12 and the Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> edged up 6.95 points to 2,216.39.
 Also on Wednesday, warehouse club operator BJ's Wholesale
Club Inc  missed profit expectations, sending its shares
down 3.7 percent at $41.70. Target  gained 2.9 percent
to $52.17 after earlier losing about 3 percent.
 With consumer spending typically accounting for about
two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, retailers have come under
heavy scrutiny by investors.
 The rebound lifted the consumer discretionary sector and
helped indexes come off their lows.
 In other earnings, Deere & Co , the maker of
construction, forestry and agricultural equipment, beat
estimates, but said sales were ""far below normal levels"" and
pointed to deteriorating conditions in Europe. Deere lost 2.2
percent to $65.73. [ID:nN18179869]
 Shares of global miner BHP Billiton 
remained in focus, falling more than 3 percent in London on
concerns that it may have to overpay for fertilizer group
Potash Corp after the Canadian firm rejected an initial offer.
 In Europe the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed
down 0.4 percent, pressured by energy stocks.
 U.S. crude for September delivery  fell $1.05 to
$74.72 a barrel. Crude oil is down around 4 percent this
month.
 World shares as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> and
Thomson Reuters <.TRXFLDGLPU> eked out gains of 0.1 percent.
Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up about 0.9 percent.
 Traders warned against reading too much into market moves
at the moment given that it is high summer in the northern
hemisphere and there are major questions about the direction of
the world economy.
 ""The market is still rangebound. There is no conviction at
the moment, and this will go on until September when investors
come back from holiday,"" said Alexandre Le Drogoff, technical
analyst at Aurel BGC in Paris.
 The dollar endured selling pressure against the yen, easing
toward recent 15-year lows on growing speculation that Japanese
authorities are unlikely to intervene to counter their
currency's recent strong run.
 The euro recovered from the day's low after a 5 billion
euro sale of German 10-year debt produced a record-low average
yield of 2.37 percent, but failed to hold above the key level
of $1.2900.
 The euro declined 0.09 percent at $1.2868 .
 ""There is currently not enough fundamentally positive news
out of Europe to drive the euro beyond 1.2900 on a sustained
basis,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief analyst at FX Solutions in
Saddle River, New Jersey.
 Sterling rose after the the release of minutes from the
Bank of England's policy meeting earlier this week showed
officials were less dovish than expected.
 The dollar shed 0.23 percent against the yen to 85.33 yen
, not far from a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading
platform EBS last week.
 U.S. Treasury bond prices gained as the decline in equities
refreshed concerns about economic strength.
 The 30-year bond surged more than a point in price to yield
3.70 percent, down from 3.77 percent at Tuesday's close and a
fresh 16-month low. Longer-dated German bonds rallied after
Berlin drew strong demand at a 5 billion euro sale of new

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The euro surrendered early
gains and fell against the dollar on Wednesday in technical
trading after again failing to holds above a key psychological
level.
 Earlier, the euro had rallied for the third straight day
against the dollar after a German government bond auction
attracted solid demand, easing some concerns about fiscal
instability in the European Union. That euphoria failed to last
much into the New York session.
 The dollar came under fresh selling pressure against the
yen, easing toward recent 15-year lows on growing speculation
that Japanese authorities are unlikely to intervene to counter
their currency's recent strong run.
 Sterling rose after the the release of minutes from the
Bank of England's latest policy meeting showed officials were
less dovish than expected.
 The euro recovered from the day's low after a 5 billion
euro sale of German 10-year debt produced a record-low average
yield of 2.37 percent. An auction of Portuguese T-bills also
went smoothly.
 But in a continuation of a trend seen over the last five
days, the euro failed to hold above the key level of $1.2900.
 ""This looks like a technical failure at the $1.2900 level,""
said Joseph Trevisani, chief analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey. ""There is currently not enough fundamentally
positive news out of Europe to drive the euro beyond 1.2900 on
a sustained basis.""
 Midway through the New York session, the euro was down 0.1
percent against the dollar at $1.2861, trading in a range
between the day's low of $1.2824 and the peak of $1.2923.
 The euro was supported at around $1.2845, the 50 percent
retracement of the single currency's fall from its March 17
high to its four-year low struck on June 7.
 The euro had recovered from this week's low of $1.2732 on
robust responses to Irish and Spanish government debt auctions,
although investors remain cautious about going long on the
single currency due to worries about peripheral euro zone
economies. 
 STERLING CLIMBS
 The pound traded 0.1 percent higher at $1.5596. It hit the
day's high after minutes from the BoE's policy meeting earlier
this month showed an 8-1 vote to hold interest rates at a
record low 0.5 percent. One policy maker voted in favor of a
rate rise.
 Sterling recovered from a three-week low hit earlier in the
day on talk the BoE minutes could reveal a three-way split
decision, which would have meant one member voting for an
increase in the central bank's quantitative easing program.
Traders reported option-related offers at $1.5660/90, which
were seen capping the pound's gains.
 The dollar shed 0.3 percent against the yen to 85.32 yen,
not far from a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading platform
EBS last week. Traders cited stops at 85.20 yen which could
check the dollar's fall.
 ""Dollar/yen is headed toward the 85 yen level and there is
little that can be done to prevent that,"" said Kenneth Broux,
markets strategist at Lloyds TSB Financial Markets.
Japanese authorities are seem as unlikely to conduct
yen-selling intervention unless the currency's rise accelerates
sharply, market players say.
 Speculation about intervention has mounted ahead of a
meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected next Monday.

(Adds details on Mercuria and Colombia's commodities sector)
 By Laura MacInnis
 GENEVA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Mercuria, one of the world's
largest private energy traders, said on Wednesday it had opened
a trading office in Bogota and purchased a Colombian river barge
business to transport coal and other commodities.
 ""This is a very important entry point for us into the
Colombian market,"" Juan Houlin, head of Mercuria Coal, said in a
rare statement from the Geneva-based company.
 ""We are very optimistic about the future of Colombia and see
it as an important country for our company now and especially in
the coming years across all our commodity products,"" he said.
 Mercuria, which traded nearly 1.2 million barrels per day of
crude oil last year, is the fifth-biggest independent energy
trader and deals in a range of goods including natural gas,
biodiesel and carbon emissions.
 Chief Executive Marco Dunand told the Reuters Energy Summit
in May that the Geneva-based company was looking at boosting its
presence in coal as it further develops its upstream operations,
infrastructure and trading desks.
 Colombia, the world's No. 5 coal exporter, is attractive to
coal shippers because it can export cargoes across the Pacific
to Asia or across the Atlantic to Europe.
 The main exporters of thermal coal from Colombia are the
privately held companies Drummond and Glencore, plus Cerrejon
Coal Company, a joint venture owned by BHP Billiton, Anglo
American and Xstrata.
 Houlin said Mercuria's newly acquired barges, purchased for
an undisclosed sum from the Colombian company Argos, would ship
coal and other commodities along the river Magdalena, which
would be leveraged across the company's trading business.
 At present, most Colombian coal is moved by rail to ports
for shipment.
 Newly inaugurated President Juan Manuel Santos has said he
plans to expand the railroad services connecting the country's
coal areas to ports and invest in infrastructure that could help
exporters of a range of goods.
 Colombia is the world's No. 3 coffee exporter and is the top
producer of high-quality Arabica beans. It also produces nickel
and gold and has natural gas reserves estimated at nearly 4
trillion cubic feet.
 Once seen as a failing state mired in cocaine violence, the
Andean nation has seen a boom in foreign investment as a result
of investor-friendly policies and a crackdown on guerrilla
violence, which Santos has vowed to continue.
 Colombia is widely expected to soon regain its investment
credit grade rating.

 * Building, outsourcing, defence particularly in focus
 * Sign of things to come when U.S. finally addresses deficit
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - As spending cuts gather pace in
Western Europe, policy decisions over where the axe falls are
becoming a key driver of individual stock prices -- the latest
shift in how politics impact markets.
 Until recently, developed world markets were seen as having
advanced beyond the stage when they might be vulnerable to
political risk in the same manner as emerging economies.
 The financial crisis shattered that assumption, perhaps
forever, but the way in which politics has acted as a market
driver has evolved over that time.
 In Europe, the shift from stimulus to spending cuts has
changed the market impact. For most of the last year, investors
have been watching national politics and aggressively
discriminating between countries, fearful a sovereign default or
major banking failure could spark another new slump.
 That meant politics has grown steadily as a driver both of
broad market sentiment and particularly sovereign debt yields.
 Now -- with perhaps more clarity on how nations approach the
crisis and how much support will be available to troubled
sovereigns and banks -- investors are looking deeper into how
political decision-making will hit individual stocks.
 ""There is now less of a focus on the armageddon-type risk
and so people are looking down more once again at individual
company stories,"" said Morgan Stanley European equity strategist
Graham Secker. 
 ""For most of the last 25 to 30 years, you haven't really had
to look at politics when it comes to assessing equities. That's
all changed now. It's the new world in which we are living.""
 For much of the crisis, political decision-making has been a
key driver of banking shares as investors looked to see trends
in regulation and bailouts. But now that is broadening.
 The heightened focus on lower level-policy-making has become
central to price moves in other sectors exposed to government
spending such as infrastructure, defence and outsourcing. 
 
 SHRINKING PIE
 ""The pie is going to be smaller than it has been and people
want to pick winners and losers,"" said Jon Levy, Europe analyst
at risk consultancy Eurasia Group. ""That means looking at
political decision-making at a much more micro level.""
 For much of the past decade -- and particularly during the
early years of the crisis -- firms and their investors saw the
revenue they received from public sector contracts as the safe
part of their balance sheet. Now, that has changed.
 ""The problem for a lot of these firms is the uncertainty
over precisely where these cuts will hit and that will likely
hang over the shares until the government clarifies its
position,"" said Jimmy Yates, head of equities at CMC Markets.
 Infrastructure shares have broadly underperformed across
Europe. Defence firms are also seen losing out -- although it is
still far from clear which arms projects will be shelved and
which will survive. 
 Airbus parent EADS will be hoping to avoid serious
cancellations to its A400M troop transporter, while other firms
including Britain's BAE Systems, Italy's Finmeccanica and
US-based Boeing and Lockheed Martin all face their own worries.
 The key trick will be picking the right individual stocks.
Which companies perform well and badly will depend heavily on
how they position themselves in the coming months. 
 Britain's outsourcing companies are a case in point. Support
services firm Serco -- with a reputation for being
well-connected to local and national government -- saw its
shares rise 3.1 percent this year, expecting to benefit as
official functions are contracted out to save money.
 Others have performed less well. IT firm Logica, expected to
lose out on government contracts, is flat, outsourcer Capita
has lost 5 percent and shares in social housing firm Connaught
have tumbled 96 percent.
 Some firms admit they were taken aback.
 ""We didn't anticipate how severe and how final the cuts
would be,"" said a spokeswoman for IT firm RM, which provides
computers for schools and has written off 1.5 million pounds
after making consultants redundant as a result of cuts that went
further than it had feared.
 Unsurprisingly, companies, interest groups, charities,
government bodies and other interested parties are all now
manoeuvring furiously to argue they should be spared the knife
and that the real savings should be made elsewhere.
 
 DETAILS HARD TO FIND
 Drilling down to get details of cuts is far from easy. To
get clarity on which companies were most exposed to the freezing
of Britain's 55-billion-pound ($86 billion) school building
programme, Reuters had to contact 26 local authorities
individually..
 In many sectors, decisions have simply not been made yet.
 ""It's a matter of watching closely, looking at government
budget decisions and listening to what the companies say,"" said
Morgan Stanley's Secker. 
 Most analysts expect Europe's austerity drive to last
several years, but with the greatest price volatility for
affected firms likely in the coming months as clarity emerges.
 So far, this dynamic seems largely limited to Europe -- not
least because the United States has yet to begin cuts and is
still using public spending to stimulate its economy. But that
too is seen shifting in the years to come.
 ""In the long term, the U.S. is also going to have to look at
deficit reduction,"" said Eurasia's Levy. ""That is going to have
a similar impact on companies there, particularly in sectors
like defence.""

 * Solid demand at German government bond auction helps euro
 * Sterling gains on less dovish BOE minutes
(Adds details, updates prices, adds quote;, changes dateline,
previous LONDON and byline)
 By NIck Olivari
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Wednesday after a German government bond auction
attracted solid demand easing some concerns about fiscal
instability in the European Union.
 The dollar came under fresh selling pressure against the
yen, easing toward recent 15-year lows on growing speculation
that Japanese authorities are unlikely to intervene to counter
their currency's recent strong run.
 The euro recovered from the day's low after a 5 billion
euro sale of German 10-year debt produced a record-low average
yield of 2.37 percent. An auction of Portuguese T-bills also
went smoothly.
 Analysts said that in the absence of major events or
economic data in the euro zone, investors had taken the
successful auctions as a cue to renew buying of the single
currency.
 Sterling rose after the Bank of England minutes were less
dovish than expected.
 European ""auctions today and yesterday have raised optimism
around the euro,"" said William Reekstin, a director with Direct
Access Partners, in New York,
 In early New York trade, the euro was up 0.1 percent
against the dollar at 1.2900, pulling away from the day's low
and again testing the 1.2900 level.
 ""1.2900 has constituted a level which the euro/dollar has
not been able to sustain a rally past over the last five
sessions, with this trend having been tested once again today,""
said Sacha Tihanyi, a currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
The euro was supported at around $1.2845, the 50 percent
retracement of the single currency's fall from its March 17
high to its four-year low struck on June 7.
 The euro had recovered from this week's low of $1.2732 on
robust responses to Irish and Spanish debt auctions, although
investors remain cautious about going long on the single
currency due to worries about peripheral euro zone economies.
 ""Sovereign debt jitters refuse to die down,"" said Neil
Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
""Spreads for Greek, Italian and Portuguese debt remain
elevated, despite the good responses to Irish and Spanish debt
auctions this week. So we should see that impacting the euro.""
 The 10-year Greek/German government bond yield spread
remained high.
 STERLING CLIMBS
 The pound traded 0.6 percent higher at $1.5682. It hit the
day's high after minutes from the BoE's policy meeting earlier
this month showed an 8-1 vote to hold interest rates at a
record low 0.5 percent.
 One policymaker voted in favour of a rate rise.
Sterling recovered from a three-week low hit earlier in the day
on talk the BoE minutes could reveal a three-way split
decision, which would have meant one member voting for an
increase in the central bank's quantitative easing program.
Traders reported option-related offers at $1.5660/90, which
were seen capping the pound's gains.
 The dollar shed 0.3 percent against the yen to 85.21 yen,
not far from a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading platform
EBS last week. Traders cited stops at 85.20 yen which could
check the dollar's fall.
 ""Dollar/yen is headed toward the 85 yen level and there is
little that can be done to prevent that,"" said Kenneth Broux,
markets strategist at Lloyds TSB Financial Markets.
 Japanese authorities are seem as unlikely to conduct
yen-selling intervention unless the currency's rise accelerates
sharply, market players say.
 Speculation about intervention has mounted ahead of a
meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected next Monday.

 * Pretax profits before impairments 121 million sterling
 * Exploring strategic options to reduce new equity needs
 * Terra Firma, Citigroup to enter mediation talks-source

(Adds detail on covenants, background)
 By Simon Meads and Kate Holton
 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - EMI's parent company said on
Wednesday further equity injections may be needed, particularly
in 2011, as the music group continues to struggle under the
weight of its debt in spite of an improved trading performance.
 But an end to a legal dispute between owner Terra Firma and
Citigroup over the 4 billion pound ($6.26 billion) buyout of EMI
could be in sight, as lawyers agreed to mediation talks, a
source familiar with the situation said.
 The music business, controlled by Guy Hands's buyout firm,
generates enough cash to cover interest payments on its 3
billion pound ($4.69 billion) debt burden, EMI parent company
Maltby Capital said in its annual report.
 However, it needs to address banking covenants that will
tighten steadily over the coming years.
 Terra Firma has been fighting to keep the business, acquired
in an auction at the height of the credit boom, out of the
clutches of lender Citigroup after breaching the terms on its
debt.
 The buyout firm raised 105 million pounds from investors
earlier this year to put EMI within its banking agreements until
March 2011.
 Maltby said it is likely there will be a ""further
significant shortfall"" when covenants are tested in March 2011,
which could substantially exceed the cash needed this year.
 Intensifying already strained relations, Terra Firma lodged
a suit against Citigroup late last year, accusing the bank of
inflating the price of EMI by not revealing that the only other
bidder, Cerberus Capital Management, had pulled out of the
auction. Citigroup denies the claims.
 Lawyers for Citigoup agreed to a request from Terra Firma's
counsel to enter mediation talks next month in New York, though
there is no certainty a settlement will be reached, the source
said.
 
 STRATEGIC OPTIONS
 EMI, led by recently appointed group Chief Executive Roger
Faxon, is exploring various strategic options for the business
which are expected to reduce the level of new equity needed, the
group said.
 Terra Firma had signalled it could tap investors for a total
of 360 million pounds to meet future covenant breaches until the
loans mature.
 EMI pretax profit, after restructuring charges but before
impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets, were 121
million pounds for the year to end-March 2010, compared with
just 7 million the previous year. Revenues were up to 1.65
billion pounds from 1.56 billion in 2009.
 The group posted a total loss of 512 million pounds,
compared with 1.57 billion last year, after impairment charges
of 602 million pounds, due in part to lower growth expectations
for digital and online music.
 EMI's improving performance followed success with the
release of the remastered Beatles catalogue, which sold over 13
million albums, as well as with newer artists such as Katy
Perry, who has sold around six million albums.
 Country group Lady Antebellum is the top seller of the year
in the United States.
 The chart success helped EMI Music, which owns such labels
as Parlophone and Capitol, to post a rise in core earnings of 15
percent to 184 million pounds due to a larger share of the
global recorded music market. 
 EMI Music Publishing, which owns the rights to classic songs
such as ""New York, New York"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", posted
core earnings up almost 13 percent to 150 million pounds.
 Songwriters and publishers signed to the Publishing division
are paid every time a piece of music is used commercially.

 * Traders say export quota is too low
 * Ukraine exported 1.2 million T of grain so far this season

 (Adds reference to Kazakh and Belarus decision in 6th par)
 By Natalya Zinets and Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine, one of the world's top
grain exporters, on Wednesday delayed a widely expected decision
to introduce grain export quotas that would more than halve
exports after severe weather ravaged its harvest.
 Ukraine plans to limit wheat exports to 1.5 million tonnes
and barley exports to 1 million tonnes in September-December
2010, according to a draft government resolution published on
Wednesday.
 ""(The quotas issue) has been delayed until the next
meeting),"" Deputy Agriculture Minister Serhiy Melnik told
reporters after a weekly government meeting.
 He added the government needed more data on grain volumes in
ports and en route to export terminals.
 Ukraine's grain harvests have been hit by severe frosts in
the winter and a scorching summer. Neighbouring Russia has
banned grain exports after a drought which sent global wheat
prices to two year highs earlier in August and triggered
inflation concerns in both nations.
 Russia's partners in the recently created customs union,
Belarus and Kazakhstan, have decided not to follow Russia in
banning grain exports, a spokesman for the customs union's
executive commission said.
 Russian weather forecasters on Wednesday said mass planting
of winter wheat for harvesting next year was unlikely to start
before Sept.10 because of its drought, which could hamper
efforts to compensate for grain lost in this year's harvest.
 They added heat was leaving central Russia and rains were
expected. Rains have already started in northwest Russia and are
moving eastwards and southwards, welcome relief after the worst
drought in over 100 years in parts of Russia.
 
 BREAD SUPPLY
 Earlier on Wednesday Ukraine's Economy Ministry said grain
export quotas were intended to ensure the nation of 46 million
people had enough bread after its damaged harvest.
 ""The destruction of significant areas under winter grains in
winter 2009/10, unfavourable weather during grain growth and
harvesting, insignificant grain stocks have affected Ukraine's
local grain market,"" the ministry said.
 ""The main task of the resolution is to ensure food safety by
imposing licences and export quotas for some agriculture
commodities for the period until December 31"", it said.
 Ukraine needs to guard against inflation under a deal with
the International Monetary Fund which last month agreed to lend
the cash-strapped country $15 billion within the next 30 months.
 Under the same deal, it has raised gas prices for households
by 50 percent this month to reduce budget deficit, making
potential wheat and bread price hikes a very sensitive issue.
 Ukraine's central bank said on Wednesday it expected
consumer prices to rise by up to one percent month-on-month in
August after four months of deflation, due to the gas price
hikes.
 
 QUOTAS TOO LOW?
 The new grain quotas are likely to more than halve combined
wheat and barley exports from the former Soviet republic
compared with the 15.4 million tonnes sold in the previous
marketing season which ran from July 2009 to June 2010.
 That volume includes 9.2 million tonnes of wheat and 6.2
million of barley. In the 2008/09 season Ukraine exported a
record 12.6 million tonnes of wheat and 6.3 million of barley.
 Ukraine plans to harvest about 17 million tonnes of wheat
clean weight in 2010 down on 2009's 20.9 million tonnes because
of the adverse weather conditions.
 Ukrainian traders, however, said the proposed volume of
export quotas was too low because the country, which consumes
about 12 million tonnes of wheat per season, could export 6.0
million tonnes of wheat and 4.0 million of barley this season.
UZA said it had asked the government to avoid any grain
export limits until September 15 and to lift current informal
limits and barriers which make exports nearly impossible.
 Traders said export limits could cause a fall in local grain
prices and cut profits of Ukrainian grain producers.
 The union said Ukraine had exported 1.2 million tonnes of
grain so far this season, including about 700,000 tonnes in
July, while the former Soviet republic sold abroad a total of
4.0 million tonnes in July-August 2009.

 By Victoria Bi and Soo Ai Peng
 SHANGHAI, Aug 18 (Reuters) - China will begin trading in the
yuan against the Malaysian ringgit  from Thursday, marking
the latest step by Beijing to internationalise its currency.
 The introduction of a sixth currency to trade against the
yuan comes after the Chinese central bank said on Tuesday it
would open the yuan bond market to funds accumulated overseas
through trade settlement or central bank swaps. [ID:nTOE67G06R]
 The initiatives are part of a broader effort by Beijing to
etch out a greater role for the yuan regionally, including
stepping up its use in Hong Kong, leading to controlled, small
openings of the capital account.
 The step is meant to ""promote bilateral trade between China
and Malaysia, to facilitate the use of yuan in cross-border
trade settlement and to reduce the costs of remittance to the
economy,"" the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS) said
in a statement on its website.
 China was Malaysia's biggest trading partner in 2009 with
total exchanges worth $36.3 billion. To allow exporters and
importers to settle trade deals in ringgit and yuan ,
the two countries signed a currency swap agreement in February
of that year.
 CFETS, an interbank funding centre for banks, insurers,
securities brokers and fund management firms, is responsible for
managing the execution of forex trading. Its announcement on
Wednesday confirms what market sources told Reuters in July.
[ID:nTOE66F03Y]
 
 Factbox on China's currency system [ID:nSGE65I02Q]
 
 Yuan-ringgit rates will be set according to dealers' bids,
CFETS said. That stands in contrast to the euro, sterling,
Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar, which are quoted according to
their dollar cross-rates.
 The yuan will also have more leeway against the ringgit,
being allowed to rise or fall by 5 percent from a mid-point
published each morning by the People's Bank of China, the
central bank.
 The yuan may only rise or fall by 0.5 percent a day against
the dollar from the mid-point and 3 percent against the other
major currencies.
 ""It is a significant move because it means that the ringgit
and yuan will have more convertibility into one another,"" said
Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, regional rates and FX strategist with
CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur.
 ""And since it will be based on dealers' bids, it is more
market driven, because generally Asian currencies have to
convert to the dollar and then get converted into whatever
currency you need.""

 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The dollar came under fresh
pressure against the yen, easing towards recent 15-year lows on
growing speculation that Japanese authorities are unlikely to
intervene to counter their currency's recent strong run.
 The euro cut losses against the dollar, while sterling
rebounded as investors reversed short positions after the
release of minutes from the Bank of England's last policy
meeting.
 ""Dollar/yen is headed towards the 85 yen level and there is
little that can be done to prevent that,"" said Kenneth Broux,
markets strategist at Lloyds TSB Financial Markets. ""There is
talk the Japanese won't intervene, as yet, and of course

 By 1030 GMT, the dollar shed 0.3 percent against the yen to
85.28 yen, not far from a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on
trading platform EBS last week. Traders cited stops at 85.20 yen
which could check the dollar's fall.
 The dollar's moves against the yen have recently had a high
correlation with U.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads,
which have narrowed as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply in the
past few months.
 Japanese authorities seem unlikely to conduct yen-selling
intervention unless the currency's rise accelerates sharply,
market players say. Speculation about intervention has mounted
ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of

 The euro was also weaker against the yen, down 0.2 percent
at 109.91 yen but off the day's low of 109.58 yen. The pair had
hit a near seven-week low of 109.07 yen on EBS earlier this
week.
 The euro was flat against the dollar at $1.2890, bouncing
from support at around $1.2845 which was the 50 percent
retracement of the single currency's fall from its March 17 high
of $1.3817 to its four-year low of $1.1876 struck on June 7.
 The euro has recovered from this week's low of $1.2732 on

 The 10-year Greek/German government bond yield spread
remained high at 853 basis points. The equivalent spread on
Portuguese bonds was flat at 284 basis points.
 There was little market reaction on Wednesday's sale of
Portuguese T-bills at which the yield on three month paper
almost halved but that on 12-month debt rose from the previous
auctions.
 Sterling pared losses and moved to session highs. The pound
was trading at $1.5644, up around 0.4 percent versus the dollar
and close to a session high of $1.5673. Traders reported
option-related offers at $1.5660/90.

 * Supply pressure to widen spreads, Spain in focus
 * U.S. macro outlook could turn sentiment against periphery
 By William James
 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The growing risk of a global
economic slowdown could scupper any further tightening of
peripheral euro zone bond yield spreads, which will also depend
on sovereigns successfully selling debt into a volatile market.
 Amid concern over the cost of bailing out the Irish banking
sector, weak Greek GDP data and concerns about the bite of
austerity plans, a wave of upcoming sovereign bond sales will
stretch investors' appetite for higher-yielding debt.
 But this resumption in primary market activity comes as fear
over the global growth outlook ramps up demand for safe-haven
debt, pushing core yields such as the U.S. 2-year Treasury and
the 10-year Bund to new lows.
 The difference in yields between lower-credit euro zone
countries and benchmark German debt had been narrowing since
May, when fears peaked that one or more states could default
under the weight of their debt burdens. Peripheral debt then put
on a strong rally in late July.
 But last week's unwinding of that move points to a return to
spread-widening pressure when markets return to full speed.
 ""The price action last week has really demonstrated that the
tightening in spreads over Bunds is going to be a real slow
grind, and there's going to be a lot of volatility along the
road,"" said Kenneth Broux, economist at Lloyds TSB in London.
 Greece, the initial focal point of investor fears, continues
to draw bets that it will default on its debt despite a European
Union and International Monetary Fund financial safety net.
 The cost of insuring against a Greek default has risen to
815 bps, over 100 basis points higher than in early June.
 
 SUPPLY HURDLES
 Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy are all expected to issue
new debt totalling up to 30 billion euros in September, with
Spanish auctions highlighted as most vulnerable to weak demand.
 Sovereign Spanish bonds could find themselves competing with
an anticipated wave of covered bond issuance from Spain's
embattled regional banks if market conditions appear favourable.
 ""There could be a lot of Spanish credit in the air at one
time, and I'm not sure if the market is really strong enough to
take this down,"" said David Schnautz, strategist at Commerzbank.
 Just a couple of bad trading days could see a return to the
euro-lifetime high 10-year spread levels seen in mid-June around
228 basis points, Schnautz said. The spread was last at 165 bps.
 Other peripheral sovereign sales are expected to be less
pressured, but there will be little let up in the recent trend
of investors requiring a large concession to buy the debt,
driving spreads wider before each auction, analysts said.
 For Ireland, concerns over the cost of bailing out the
country's banking sector, which sparked spread widening across
the periphery last week, will continue to remain the sovereign's
weak spot in coming months, despite having made strong progress
towards its 2010 funding targets.
 
 MACRO OUTLOOK
 As peripheral states battle to trim budgets while limiting
the impact on growth, financial plans for 2011 will also be a
key focus, with markets sensitive to any sign that government
resolve to address bloated deficits is waning.
 But even if markets are satisfied by domestic measures, the
storm brewing in the U.S. economy could hit global appetite for
riskier debt and cause euro zone spreads to widen anew.
 Data showing the U.S. economic recovery is stalling has
prompted the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy, raising
questions over the sustainability of recent outperformance in
the euro zone, sending investors scurrying to safe-haven assets.
 The U.S. non-farm payrolls employment report due on Sept 3
will be the next milestone for judging the health of the U.S.
economy.
 ""The one million dollar question is whether we get spillover
from the U.S. to Europe in Q3-Q4. If that is the case, I think
you will see spreads continue to widen regardless of progress
that's being made domestically,"" said Lloyds TSB's Broux.

(Adds detail from Basel, FSB statement)
 VIENNA, Aug 18 (Reuters) - New rules for banks' capital and
liquidity will have only a modest impact on economic output
while they are phased in, but result in substantial long-term
benefits, the groups charged with drafting the rules said.
 The new ""Basel III"" rules will tighten lending and reduce
investment during a transition period to a much lower degree
than forecast by banks, the Basel Committee for Banking
Supervision and the Financial Stability Board said on Wednesday.
 But they will make financial crises and the output losses
they cause much less likely and this outweighs the transitional
output loss during the few years in which they are phased in,
the two bodies said in a statements.
 ""The analysis shows that the macroeconomic costs of
implementing stronger standards are manageable, ... while the
longer-term benefits to financial stability and more stable
economic growth are substantial,"" FSB Chairman Mario Draghi said
in the statement.
 The FSB said its analysis showed that for each percentage
point rise in the ratio of tangible common equity to
risk-weighted assets over four years, global gross domestic
product would decline by 0.2 percent.
 Basel III will likely demand banks have a core Tier 1
capital -- roughly equivalent to tangible common equity -- ratio
of 4-6 percent, sources told Reuters last week.
 The FSB analysis is based on the rise in actual capital
levels. Banks are typically holding much more capital than the
regulatory minimum.
The only other comparable assessment of the economic impact
of Basel III to date was published by bank lobby group Institute
of International Finance (IIF) in June.
 The IIF said proposed regulatory measures -- also including
bank levy plans -- would cut 3 percent off economic growth over
the next five years in the United States, euro zone and Japan,
and cost almost 10 million jobs.

 By Tamara Walid and John Acher
 DUBAI/COPENHAGEN, Aug 18 (Reuters) - A recovery in global
trade lifted profits at key port and shipping operators on
Wednesday and pointed to continued strong results in the second
half of the year.
 Danish shipping and oil group A.P. Moller-Maersk rebounded
into profit in the first half, benefiting from a recovery in
freight rates and volumes to pre-crisis levels, and lifted its
2010 outlook.
 Dubai's government-controlled DP World, one of the world's
largest port operators, reported growing container volumes and
better pricing, taking its profit past analysts' expectations.
 Figures from the two groups support evidence of rising world
trade flows -- Maersk in particular is seen as a barometer of
global trade as its fleet has 14.6 percent of all container
shipping capacity.
 The Suez Canal said recently it had seen its highest daily
revenue since the 2008 financial crisis, while Germany's TUI AG
said it saw a rebound in demand at its Hapag-Lloyd container
shipping unit. 
 A.P. Moller-Maersk CEO Nils Smedegaard Andersen said
container rates were back at 2008 levels and volumes were close
to that mark as analysts heralded a surge in global restocking.
 ""Overall expectations for the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group are
that the result for 2010 will exceed $4 billion,"" the group
said, upgrading its outlook made last month that the result
would exceed the 2008 level of $3.5 billion.
 Andersen told Reuters in a phone interview: ""The market has
normalised in terms of both demand and capacity, but the
question remains if we'll see consumption pick up in Europe and
the U.S. to drive the market ... That hasn't changed for the
past three quarters.""
 Compared with 2009, Maersk's freight rates rose 31 percent
and volumes 11 percent, rebounding to 2008 levels.
 
 NEW TERMINALS
 DP World's first-half net profit attributable to
shareholders reached $164 million, the company said. Net profit
after tax from continuing operations rose to $206 million from
$188 million a year ago, beating forecasts of between $148
million and $158 million.
 DP World Chief Executive Mohammed Sharaf said new terminals
and improvements in non-container revenue, along with continued
cost management, helped lift earnings.
 Joice Mathew, head of research at United Securities LLC,
said: ""The increase in revenue indicates returning of pricing
power on to the hands of port operators as the global restocking
cycle is in progress.""
 A.P. Moller-Maersk, which includes the world's biggest
container shipping company Maersk Line, swung to a net profit of
13.4 billion Danish crowns ($2.3 billion) for the first six
months of 2010 from a loss of 3.67 billion a year earlier.
 The result for Denmark's biggest company beat all forecasts
in a Reuters poll of analysts, where the average expectation was
for a net profit of 9.12 billion crowns. Due to increasing
volumes, Maersk began redeploying
laid-up vessels in the second quarter, putting 14 ships back
into service by the end of July from 19 laid up at end-2009.
 Andersen said, however, that fourth-quarter shipping rates
would be lower than current rates after the peak season ends.
 Maersk said it expected second-half container shipping
results to be on par with the first half, but warned there was
""significant uncertainty"" about the fourth quarter.
 Sharaf said he saw stronger results for the rest of the
year, driven by seasonal trade flows, contributions from new
terminals and improvement in non-container revenue.
 ""Uncertainty lingers over the sustainability of global trade
volumes in the second half,"" Sharaf said. ""We are on track to
meet full-year results in line with our expectations.""
 DP World's first-half container volume climbed 7 percent.
 Maersk's APM Terminals unit -- which with six-month revenue
of $2.18 billion and operating profits of $607 million is bigger
than DP World -- saw the volume of containers it handled rise 6
percent in the first half, below estimated global market growth
of 12 percent, the Danish group said.
 Maersk shares were off 1.2 percent by 1144 GMT, recovering
from session lows, while DP World gained 3.1 percent.

 * Minister says government cannot afford demands
 * Any agreement expected to swell state spending

(Adds expectations of expanded strike, paragraph four)
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 18 (Reuters) - More than one million South
African state workers went on strike for more pay on Wednesday,
threatening a prolonged action they say will bring the
government in Africa's largest economy to a halt.
 The strike, punctuated by reported scuffles at hospitals and
schools, is not immediately expected to have a major economic
impact but a protracted work stoppage could hurt commerce at
home and trade abroad.
 ""We have nothing to lose but the chains that bind us,"" said
Norman Mampane, national spokesman for the POPCRU police and
prison guards' union, which is one of the groups in the labour
coalition representing about 1.3 million state workers.
 The labour action is expected to escalate on Thursday as
more unions join the work stoppage with protests including
teachers trying to block one of the main highways into
Johannesburg and hospital employees staging pickets outside
emergency rooms.
Local media reported some pushing and shoving between
striking workers and managers at a few hospitals and schools
during Wednesday's action.
 Economists worry that whatever deal is reached will swell
state spending as the government tries to bring its deficit down
from 6.7 percent of gross domestic product.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ""As government, as the employer, we have indicated and
demonstrated for all to see that our capacity to afford is
actually exhausted,"" Public Services Minister Richard Baloyi
told a news conference in Cape Town.
 Baloyi said a deal would cost at least 5 billion rand ($690
million) more than budgeted and cuts would have to be made
elsewhere. He repeated a threat that the government could
unilaterally impose its wage offer to end the standoff.
 Analysts expect a deal to be reached in the next few days at
the earliest or before September at the latest, which would
curtail economic damage.
 The groups staged a one-day warning strike last week and
said the action on Wednesday could be the start of the largest
civil servants' strike in three years. 
 
 UNDER PRESSURE
 The strike increases pressure on President Jacob Zuma's
ruling African National Congress to reach a deal with organised
labour and appease the party's longstanding union allies who
also have been a reliable source of votes.
 But pressure will also mount on unions to reach a deal as
rank and file members lose pay from being off the job and some
look favourably on the government's offer.
 Public opinion could turn against the unions if a prolonged
work stoppage forces parents to find day care for their
children, delays treatment at hospitals and slows paperwork at
government agencies.
 A mid-range civil servant already makes about 40 percent
more in wages and benefits than the average South African
worker, who takes home 6,383 rand ($880) a month.
 Those going on strike include police, healthcare workers,
teachers and customs officials. Essential services are expected
to be maintained through skeleton staffing.
 ""Additional pressure on public sector finances and the
subsequent need to increase the taxes will have consequential
downstream impact on both business and consumers,"" the South
African Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in a statement.
 The last big public sector strike in South Africa took place
in 2007 when a four-week strike by 600,000 state workers cost
the economy several million lost man-days, discouraged investors
and angered the public.
 Last week the government offered to increase the monthly
housing allowance to 700 rand from a previous offer of 630 rand,
but refused to increase its wage rise offer of 7 percent.
[ID:nLDE67C0Z4] 
 Unions are demanding an 8.6 percent pay rise, more than
double the inflation rate, and 1,000 rand for housing. 
 The housing allowance alone would be equal to about one
percent of all government spending.

 * Dollar pressured by yen
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - World stocks were flat on
Wednesday, held back by losses in Europe that were partly caused
by energy shares taking a beating from the weaker oil price.
 Wall Street looked set to open flat.
 Shares of global miner BHP Billiton  remained
in focus, falling 2 percent in London on concerns that it may
have to overpay for Canadian fertiliser group Potash Corp after
the Canadian group rejected an initial offer.
 The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies
<.DXY>, weakening particularly against the yen  on growing
speculation that Japanese authorities are unlikely to intervene
to counter their currency's recent strong run.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.4 percent,
dragged lower by energy stocks. The STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas
index <.SXEP> was down 1.1 percent.
 Oil prices have been hit by worries about global economic
growth and high inventories.
 An industry report signalled petroleum inventories in top
consumer the United States were headed for a record, following
an unexpected sharp increase in crude stocks last week.
 U.S. crude for September delivery  was off more than
$1 at $74.72 a barrel. It is down around 4 percent this month.
 World shares as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> and Thomson
Reuters <.TRXFLDGLPU> were up less than 0.1 percent. Japan's
Nikkei<.N225> earlier closed up nearly 0.9 percent.
 Traders warned against reading too much into market moves at
the moment given that it is high summer in the northern
hemisphere and there are major questions about the direction of
the world economy.
 ""The market is still rangebound. There is no conviction at
the moment, and this will go on until September when investors
come back from holiday,"" said Alexandre Le Drogoff, technical
analyst at Aurel BGC in Paris.
 
 SOVEREIGN WORRY
 The euro cut losses against the dollar, while sterling
rebounded as investors reversed short positions after the
release of minutes from the Bank of England's last policy
meeting.
 ""Dollar/yen is headed towards the 85 yen level and there is
little that can be done to prevent that,"" said Kenneth Broux,
markets strategist at Lloyds TSB Financial Markets. ""There is
talk the Japanese won't intervene as yet, and of course Japanese
yields are still positive."" 
 The dollar shed 0.3 percent against the yen to 85.29 yen
, not far from a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on trading
platform EBS last week.

 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The euro struggled near key
technical support levels on Wednesday as debt worries weighed,
while the Canadian dollar was supported by a huge takeover bid
by global miner BHP Billiton for Canada's Potash Corp.
 The yen pushed higher, with market players citing yen buying
by Japanese investors and exporters in yen crosses and the
dollar.
 ""Sovereign debt jitters refuse to die down,"" said Nick
Mellor, currency strategist, at Bank of New York Mellon. ""Spreads
for Greek, Italian and Portuguese debt remain elevated, despite
the good responses to Irish and Spanish debt auctions this week.
So we should see that impacting the euro.""
 By 0800 GMT, the euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.2858,
holding above support at around $1.2845 which was the 50 percent
retracement of the single currency's fall from its March 17 high
of $1.3817 to its four-year low of $1.1876 struck on June 7.
Next support is seen near its 100-day moving average of $1.2781
and then at this week's low of $1.2730.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to 109.91 yen, giving back half of
the previous day's 0.6 percent gain. It had hit a near
seven-week low of 109.07 yen on trading platform EBS earlier
this week.
 The 10-year Greek/German government bond yield spread
remained high at 854 basis points. The equivalent spread on
Portuguese bonds was flat at 285 basis points ahead of debt
auctions later in the day. Germany is also scheduled to sell
bonds on Wednesday.
The dollar shed 0.1 percent against the yen to 85.45 yen,
staying above its 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on EBS last week.
 The dollar's moves against the yen have recently had a high
correlation with U.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads,
which have narrowed as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply in the
past few months.
 Traders said Japanese exporters were placing dollar offers
from around 86.50 yen to 89.00 yen, having lowered their target
levels for selling the dollar from around 90 yen previously.
 
 MARGIN TRADERS
 Data from the Tokyo Financial Exchange showed Japanese
margin traders' net long positions in dollar/yen stood at
146,095 contracts -- about $1.46 billion in value -- on Tuesday,
down form a recent peak of 182,966 contracts on Aug. 6 but still
a very high level historically.
 Margin traders with dollar bets are likely to take profits
when the greenback rises, limiting gains. Investors are also
watching whether the Bank of Japan or the government will take
new steps to rein in the yen's export-sapping rise ahead of a
meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected next Monday.
 Japanese authorities seem unlikely to conduct yen-selling
intervention, however, unless the yen's rise accelerates
sharply, market players say.
 Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was flat against the
greenback at C$1.0325 having surged on Tuesday after BHP
Billiton launched an unsolicited $38.6 billion bid for Canada's
Potash Corp..
 ""As is often the case with international M&A deals the 'buy
the rumour, sell the fact' reaction often dominates,"" Ulrich
Leuchtmann, analyst at Commerzbank said in a note. 
 ""Usually it is unknown what share of the deal is actually
settled in cash and which currency will be used. The subject
will initially provide subliminal support for the Canadian
dollar.""

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The yen rose on Wednesday, with
traders citing yen buying by Japanese investors and exporters,
while the Canadian dollar held gains scored on news of a huge
takeover bid by global miner BHP Billiton for Canada's Potash
Corp.
 The yen dipped against the dollar and the euro in early Asian
trading, staying on the defensive after retreating the previous
day as U.S. and European shares rose and U.S. Treasury yields
edged higher.
 But the yen later received a boost, with market players
citing yen buying by Japanese investors and exporters in yen
crosses and the dollar.
 The dollar shed 0.1 percent against the yen to 85.40 yen,
slipping back toward a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on EBS last
week.
 ""The trend in dollar/yen remains downward,"" said Jun Kato,
senior manager of the investment department at Shinkin Asset
Management.
 ""The talk in the market is that a huge pile of dollar offers
awaits above 86.50 yen. Given that, players must be thinking that
chasing the dollar above 86.00 yen is a waste of time.""
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to 109.67 yen, giving back much of
the previous day's 0.6 percent gain and slipping back towards a
nearly seven week low of 109.07 yen hit on trading platform EBS
earlier this week.
 Against the dollar, the euro dipped 0.3 percent to $1.2852.
 The dollar's moves against the yen have recently had a high
correlation with U.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads,
which have narrowed as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply in the
past few months.
 In addition to the talk of yen buying by Japanese exporters
on Wednesday, a manager at a major Japanese bank said Japanese
exporters were placing dollar offers from around 86.50 yen to
89.00 yen, having lowered their target levels for selling the
dollar from around 90 yen previously.
 MARGIN TRADERS
 Data from the Tokyo Financial Exchange showed Japanese margin
traders' net long positions in dollar/yen stood at 146,095
contracts -- about $1.46 billion in value -- on Tuesday, down
form a recent peak of 182,966 contracts on Aug. 6 but still a
very high level historically.
 Margin traders with dollar bets are likely to take profits
when the greenback rises, limiting gains in the currency.
 When the dollar falls sharply, Japanese retail margin traders
could be forced to cut long dollar positions, adding momentum to
the drop, traders said.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the Canadian dollar
to C$1.0333, trimming a bit of its losses after shedding more
than 1 percent on Tuesday.
 The Canadian dollar had surged on Tuesday after BHP Billiton
launched an unsolicited $38.6 billion bid for Canada's Potash
Corp.
 Investors are watching whether the Bank of Japan or the
government will take new steps to rein in the yen's
export-sapping rise ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister
Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected
next Monday.
 Japanese authorities seem unlikely to conduct yen-selling
intervention, however, unless the yen's rise accelerates sharply,
market players say.
 A more likely response would be some form of monetary easing
by the BOJ such as expanding the amount or maturity of a
three-month fixed-rate fund supply operation, which the central
bank decided to adopt last December after the dollar dropped
below 85 yen in late November.
 An options trader for a major Japanese bank said there was
scepticism among Japanese traders over whether any BOJ easing
measures would have much impact on the yen with Japanese interest
rates already so low, and there were also doubts about whether
the central bank would unveil any easing steps in the near term.
 While market speculation about possible steps by the BOJ may
lend support to the dollar against the yen for now, the dollar
may eventually extend its decline if the market is disappointed
by any BOJ measures or if it takes no action, the trader said.
 ""In the end there could be disappointment, in which case the
dollar may fall towards 83 yen,"" he said.

 * WHEN: Friday, Aug 20, 4:00 pm (0800 GMT)
 REUTERS FORECAST (percentage change from a year earlier):
 MEDIAN RANGE JUNE MAY NUMBER OF FORECASTS
 20.5 15 to 22.5 22.4 34.03 11
 FACTORS TO WATCH
 Taiwan's expected growth in orders for July shows that
major markets such as China, Europe and the United States
continued to buy electronics and other manufactured goods from
the island but at a slower rate than earlier in the year.
 A 20.5 percent y/y rise in orders for the island, a
barometer of export trends in Asia, would be close to June's
figure, partly due to a seasonal lull that normally picks up
later in the year ahead of the Christmas holiday.
 However, slower-than-expected economic recovery in the
United States, a government-driven effort to cool credit in
China and latent fears of a resurgent sovereign debt crisis in
Europe may keep Taiwan's orders flat or push them lower in the
third quarter or for the rest of 2010.
 A base effect that began to creep up around mid-2009 after
the global economic downturn is also limiting growth this year.
Growth in Taiwan orders reached a year-to-date peak in January
at 71.8 pct on the year, due largely to the low base.
 Taiwan's industrial output is seen tracking export orders
upward, though with less strength than earlier in the year, as
manufacturing grew to meet demand from overseas, economists
say.
 MARKET REACTION
 July export orders are unlikely to affect Taiwan's stock
<.TWII> or currency  markets as investors have already
reacted to earlier signs of a slowing recovery.
 Taiwan's central bank is expected to keep raising interest
rates by 12.5 to 25 basis points per quarter after beginning to
lift them in June from a record low of 1.25 percent set in
February 2009 at the depths of the economic downturn.
 But the authority may pause those hikes for a quarter or
two if the economy continues to slow.

can play a greater role in bringing development and jobs to
Latin America, an area where Chinese investment and trade is
small but growing fast, a senior U.S. official said on
Wednesday.
 ""We very much welcome continued Chinese engagement,
investment and trade with countries of the Western Hemisphere.
I think that helps to strengthen the economies, to provide
employment for people in these countries,"" said Arturo
Valenzuela, the Obama administration's top diplomat for Latin
America.
 ""It certainly is not of concern, it certainly is not a
threat,"" he told reporters in Beijing, when asked if Washington
was worried about any aspect of China's relationship with Latin
America, long considered the United States' strategic backyard.
 China has close ties with both Cuba and Venezuela, neither
of which have good relations with the United States.
 Valenzuela, the assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere
affairs, said he ""noted"" that most Chinese imports from Latin
America were of raw materials, such as copper from Chile or
soybeans from Brazil.
 Yet only five percent of Chinese trade as a whole was with
the region, he added.
 ""If that can grow, that's extremely valuable,"" Valenzuela
said. ""Our fundamental objective is to ensure prosperous,
growing economies in the Western Hemisphere and that benefits
us all.
 ""The challenge for the countries of Latin America is to
grow in order to be able to overcome significant inequalities,
very large pockets of poverty and things like that,"" he added.
 ""Latin America has to grow, much more robustly if it is to
be able to overcome some of these problems, and that can be
accomplished through greater investment and through greater
trade,"" Valenzuela said.
 ""China has even greater opportunities to focus some of its
trade on the Western Hemisphere. China's increased its
investment significantly over the last few years, but it's
still a very small fraction of the investment the United States
has made.""

 * Peru economy sizzling
 * Little policy change seen (Recasts, adds comments from
Garcia)
 By Patricia Velez and Terry Wade
 LIMA, Aug 17 (Reuters) - President Alan Garcia said on
Tuesday he will shuffle his cabinet at the appropriate time,
but brushed aside comments by three people in his party and
government that Finance Minister Mercedes Araoz will go.
 The cabinet changes would be carried out as some ministers
want to step down to run in regional elections in October,
Garcia said. The shakeup, which is widely expected to include
Primer Minister Javier Velasquez, would come as Peru's economy
surges at one of the world's fastest paces.
 ""With the economy you have to be calm,"" Garcia said when
asked if he would replace Araoz.
 Garcia spoke late on Tuesday at a public works project and
when asked when the changes would be made, he said: ""Not yet,
the truth is that I will announce them at an opportune time.""
 Three sources told Reuters earlier on Tuesday the shuffle
would be announced in the coming days and that Araoz would be
on the departure list.
 Expectations of the pending cabinet changes had little
impact on financial markets as no marked shift in economic
policy by Garcia's center-right government is expected.
 Araoz, an economist who recently got into a public row with
the central bank's monetary policy director over whether she
was spending too much money and contributing to inflation, has
been in the job for about nine months.
 She has been encouraged by some members of Garcia's APRA
party to run for office. Ismael Benavides, who once led one of
Peru's largest banks and previously served as agriculture
minister for Garcia, is seen as her most likely replacement.
 ""It's going to be Thursday,"" one source said. ""We know that
Mercedes Araoz will leave no matter what,"" said another source.
 Benavides, who declined to comment, is trained as an
agricultural economist and is respected in Peru's banking
world.
 POLITICAL AMBITION, POLICY RIFT
 Araoz recently said Peru would meet this year's fiscal
deficit target of 1.6 percent of gross domestic product. She
has been able to ramp up spending because tax receipts are
surging on a sizzling economy -- which grew nearly 12 percent
in June from a year ago.
 Inflation, while speeding up, is expected to be around 3
percent this year, at the top end of the central bank's
inflation target range.
 Economic growth is seen at 7 percent with some forecasts
being revised upwards as surging domestic demand, led by
construction and easier credit, replace the traditional engine
of minerals exports.
 Araoz, who helped craft numerous free-trade deals in her
previous role as trade minister, has discarded talk of her own
departure and one of her aides denied she would leave.
 Her policy rift with the central bank was not mentioned by
the sources as a reason for her potential departure.
 They said a replacement for Velasquez, who has struggled to
keep a lid on social conflicts over natural resources, has yet
to be identified.
 Leaders of Garcia's party have mentioned Araoz as desirable
candidate to have run on their ticket, perhaps for the
presidency in general elections next year, when Garcia cannot
run.
 Araoz, who is not currently affiliated with any party, is
telegenic and seen as having political ambitions but a poll
showed that her candidacy would draw little support.

 * More Japanese exporter dlr offers seen at Y86.50-Y89.00
 * Canadian dlr hold gains made on huge corporate takeover bid
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The yen rose on Wednesday, with
traders citing yen-buying by Japanese players, while the Canadian
dollar held gains made on news of a huge takeover bid by global
miner BHP Billiton for Canada's Potash Corp.
 The yen dipped against the dollar and the euro in early Asian
trading, staying on the defensive after retreating the previous
day as U.S. and European shares rose and U.S. Treasury yields
edged higher.
 But the yen later received a boost, with market players
citing yen buying by Japanese investors and exporters in yen
crosses and the dollar.
 The dollar shed 0.1 percent against the yen to 85.39 yen,
slipping back toward a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit on EBS last
week.
 ""The trend of dollar-selling looks unchanged,"" said a trader
for a Japanese foreign exchange broker.
 ""The yen has been sold a bit but there was no major slide,
suggesting this was just a bit of a pullback move,"" the trader
said, referring to the yen's decline the previous day.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to 109.64 yen, giving back much of
the previous day's 0.6 percent gain and slipping back towards its
lowest in nearly seven weeks of 109.07 yen hit on trading
platform EBS earlier this week.
 Against the dollar, the euro dipped 0.4 percent to $1.2838.
 The dollar's moves against the yen have recently had a high
correlation with U.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads,
which have narrowed as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply in the
past few months.
 In addition to the talk of yen buying by Japanese exporters
on Wednesday, a manager at a major Japanese bank said Japanese
exporters were placing dollar offers from around 86.50 yen to
89.00 yen, having lowered their target levels for selling the
dollar from around 90 yen previously.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the Canadian dollar
to C$1.0339, trimming a bit of its losses after shedding
more than 1 percent against the Canadian dollar on Tuesday.
 The Canadian dollar surged on Tuesday after BHP Billiton
launched an unsolicited $38.6 billion bid for Canada's Potash
Corp.
 JAPAN'S STANCE ON YEN
 Investors are watching whether the Bank of Japan or the
government will take new steps to rein in the yen's
export-sapping rise ahead of a meeting between Prime Minister
Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa expected
next Monday.
 Japanese authorities seem unlikely to conduct yen-selling
intervention unless the yen's rise accelerates, market players
say.
 The more likely response by Japanese authorities would be
some form of monetary easing by the BOJ such as expanding the
amount or maturity of its three-month fixed-rate fund supplying
operation, which the central bank decided to adopt last December
after the dollar's drop below 85 yen in late November.
 An options trader for a major Japanese bank said there was
scepticism among Japanese traders about whether any BOJ easing
measures would have much impact on the yen with Japanese interest
rates already so low, and there were also doubts about whether
the central bank would unveil any easing steps in the near term.
 While market speculation about possible steps by the BOJ may
lend support to the dollar against the yen for now, the dollar
may eventually extend its decline if the market is disappointed
by any BOJ measures or it takes no action, the trader said.
 ""In the end there could be disappointment, in which case the
dollar may fall towards 83 yen,"" he said.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Most Asian stocks rose on
Wednesday as earnings from two U.S. retail giants and a $39
billion takeover bid in the farm sector bolstered investor
confidence, but mixed U.S. economic data capped gains.
 Japanese shares gained as investors hunted for bargains

have to pay too much to buy fertiliser group Potash Corp after
the Canadian group rejected the original offer.
 The Anglo-Australian miner, sitting on an estimated $11

the global fertiliser industry following a collapse in demand

 ""It is just BHP; one big story taking out a lot of points

 TOKYO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The euro dipped against the dollar
on Wednesday but its losses were limited after solid demand at
Irish and Spanish bond auctions the previous day eased some
jitters about heavily indebted euro zone countries.
 The yen dipped against the dollar after U.S. shares rose and
U.S. Treasury yields edged higher the previous day.
 The Japanese currency, however, was still not far from a
15-year high of 84.72 yen to the dollar hit last week on trading

 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.2870. The euro rose 0.4
percent the previous day according to Reuters data, helped by
solid demand at Irish and Spanish debt auctions that also spurred
a narrowing in peripheral euro zone bond yield spreads.
 But Moody's Investors Service told Reuters in an interview on
Tuesday that it still had enough doubts about the outlook for
Spain's public finances to keep the sovereign's triple A rating
under review.
 The euro could come under pressure again if the market's

 * Central banks seen stepping in to tame currency rally

 * Curbing currencies could slow rate up-cycle
 By Simon Gardner
 SANTIAGO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - South American policymakers
will likely step up intervention to stem surging currency
gains, but they tread a fine line that risks fueling inflation
and could even put the brakes on a regional rate up-cycle.
 Lured by higher interest rates and economic growth amid a
faltering recovery in the United States and Europe, foreign
investors are betting on the region's commodity powerhouses.
Dollar inflows are boosting currencies and hurting exporters.
 Peru's central bank has aggressively intervened this year
to buy nearly $6 billion to soak up excess liquidity, while the
finance ministry said last week it would buy $500 million in
foreign exchange markets by year-end to temper its sol 
currency, which is at 2-year highs.
 Brazil called an auction on Tuesday to buy dollars on the
spot market in a bid to boost reserves and limit currency
volatility. [ID:nN16270408]
 The presidents of Chile and Colombia have both signaled
concern about sharp gains in their countries' currencies.
 But verbal intervention will likely not be enough.
 ""I think the central banks will continue to intervene
heavily. The central banks that have not yet come in, will.
That means Colombia and Chile,"" said Flavia Cattan-Naslausky, a
strategist at RBS Securities.
 ""The problem with intervention is that the global
environment is still very fragile.""

------------------------------------------------------->
 Policymakers could opt to buy dollars to boost
international reserves, tax imports or offer incentives to
exporters to help counter currency appreciation.
 They could also raise deposit requirements to help curb
money supply, or raise the overnight rate on interbank loans in
dollars.
 Analysts say Chile is likely to delay the rate at which it
repatriates hundreds of millions of dollars to help fund
reconstruction after a massive February earthquake.
 RATE UP-CYCLE TO SLOW?
 Chile joined a regional rate up-cycle led by Peru and
Brazil after keeping its key rate at a record low to help the
economy recover from the quake and global crisis. But taming
currencies may slow the pace of future hikes in the region.
 ""By intervening in the foreign exchange market buying
dollars you throw pesos into the system (via bonds) and that
will eventually generate inflationary pressures,"" said Alfredo
Coutino, Latin America director at Moody's Economy.com.
 ""I don't see a future for a continuous (rate) heightening
cycle in Latin America,"" he added, saying intervention would
likely slow the pace of interest rate increases.
 Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Thursday he
would use all macroeconomic tools to keep the country's peso
 competitive, but after a brief retracement, the
currency continued to surge near 7-month highs. For more, see
[ID:nN12124343]
 The same day, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos met
with the central bank to discuss the strength of the country's
peso , which is up around 10 percent against the dollar
year-to-date. [ID:nN12123476]
 Peru's central bank this year has sought to squeeze
speculative capital out by raising deposit requirements on
dollar loans from abroad and local bank accounts denominated in
dollars. [ID:nN18173256]
 Despite heavy intervention, Peru's sol is up nearly 3
percent so far this year at around 2.8 per dollar, and the
market sees it appreciating by another 1.0 to 2.0 percent by
year-end.
 In neighboring Chile, investors expect the central bank to
buy dollars if the peso, which has surged over 3 percent in
August alone, firms toward around 480 per dollar. The peso is
now 1.0 percent higher year-to-date.
 During the 2008 commodity boom that pushed the Chilean
currency to 430 pesos per dollar, the central bank began buying
dollars on the local market to build up its reserves and the
currency weakened sharply by the year-end. It then rebounded by
more than 26 percent in 2009.
 Chilean exporters are feeling the pinch, and want action.
 ""Producers are really affected by exchange rate variations
and intervention to ensure stability would be positive,"" said
Miguel Montenegro, manager of Chilean berry exporter Blue
Valley. Chile is the world's leading copper producer and is
also a major fruit, wood pulp and salmon exporter.
 The Brazilian real's  sharp appreciation has also hit
exporters. But traders continue to test 1.75 per dollar, even
after the government voiced support for a weaker real.
 Doug Smith, head of Latin American research at Standard
Chartered in New York, expects more intervention -- whoever
wins an Oct. 3 presidential election -- via verbal warnings,
double spot auctions or reverse swaps.
 However, nothing the central bank will do will come as much
of a surprise to major players in the market, says Joao
Medeiros, a partner at Pioneer Corretora, one of Brazils
biggest currency brokerages.
""The market is like a game of poker but one in which the
central bank can see everyones cards,"" he said. ""The central
bank could do up to 10 auctions in one day if it needed to but
it won't. It has everything under control.""

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday, snapping
a five-day decline, as expanding U.S. corporate earnings and
industrial production eased worries about the economy and a
weaker dollar made commodities cheaper for holders of other
currencies.
 U.S. crude for September delivery  rose 53 cents to
settle at $75.77 a barrel, after hitting a one-month low of
$74.86 during Monday trade.
 After settlement, U.S. crude prices pared gains and were up
just 23 cents a barrel, following an American Petroleum
Institute report, which showed U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly
gained 5.9 million barrels last week. [API/S]
 Europe's Brent crude futures, whose new contract is for
October delivery , rose more sharply than U.S. futures,
gaining $1.30 a barrel to settle at $76.93.
 Brent traded at its widest premium to West Texas
Intermediate since mid-June, as crude stocks near 20-year highs
in the United States tempered investor appetite for near-term
U.S. crude.
 Stronger-than-expected earnings reports from bellwether
retailers Wal-Mart and Home Depot helped to push U.S. equities
higher, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index gaining 1.2
percent. [.N]
 ""Crude futures have rebounded strongly today, following a

 Data also showed U.S. industrial production expanded in

 BRENT BOOM
 October Brent traded on Tuesday at a premium of up to 88
cents a barrel to October U.S. crude, its steepest advantage
since mid-June. 
 U.S. crude stocks are near 20-year highs, while combined
commercial crude and oil product stocks are at their highest
level since 1990, according to government data.
 API data on Tuesday showed U.S. crude stocks rose 5.9
million barrels last week, while distillates and gasoline
stocks also rose. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a
draw in crude and gasoline, and a more modest build for
distillates. [EIA/S] 
 Adding to Brent's relative strength are crude inventories
at Cushing, Oklahoma, WTI's main delivery point, at near record
highs. They stood at 37.7 million barrels in the week through
Aug. 6, just shy of a record 37.9 million barrels in mid-May,
according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
 A perceived glut at the NYMEX delivery point can depress
near-term WTI prices, which rose less sharply on Tuesday than
U.S. oil futures for later delivery.
 API data showed Cushing stocks fell slightly last week, by
687,000 barrels.
 U.S. gasoline demand normally peaks in the summer driving
season, draining inventories. But stocks this summer have
risen.
 The EIA will publish its own weekly data on Wednesday.
 Goldman Sachs, in a weekly commodities research report,
told clients it is likely that global oil demand has recently
been outstripping supply by 600,000 barrels a day on a
seasonally adjusted basis.
 The U.S. bank pointed to a 40 million to 45 million barrel
drawdown in oil stocks kept on tankers at sea over June and
July, which it said far outweighed a rise in global onshore
stocks, estimated by the International Energy Agency to have
risen by around 21 million barrels.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Global shares prices rose on
Tuesday as two big U.S. retailers reported higher-than-expected
earnings, while the euro rose as worries over Europe's
sovereign debt problems eased.
 Solid demand for European bonds also helped the euro
strengthen for a second straight day.
 Mergers and acquisition talk boosted shares after mining
giant BHP Billiton Ltd  made an unsolicited
$38.6 billion takeover bid for Canada's Potash Corp of
Saskatchewan Inc .
 The yen, which has hovered near 15-year highs against the
greenback and seven-week peaks against the euro, gave up ground
as investors converted safe-haven cash to take advantage of
beaten down asset prices.
 Spot gold prices edged up to seven-week highs while crude
oil prices rose slightly after a sell-off on Monday, benefiting
from the U.S. dollar's weak performance.
 U.S. Treasury prices fell sharply after rallying on Monday
on speculative buying ahead of purchases by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which said it is reinvesting the proceeds of its
mortgage bond holdings by buying U.S. Treasuries.
 At the close the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose
103.84 points, or 1.01 percent, to 10,405.85. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 13.16 points, or 1.22 percent,
to 1,092.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 27.57
points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,209.44.
 Potash, the world's largest fertilizer maker, rejected the
bid from BHP Billiton as ""grossly inadequate,"" though its
shares surged and the bid helped boost the market.
[ID:nNSGE67G0D].
 ""The deal talk is a big catalyst for today's rally. It
validates that there is a greater confidence in the outlook for
materials companies,"" said John Praveen, chief investment
strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC
in New Jersey.
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the world's largest retailer,
and Home Depot Inc , the biggest U.S. home improvement
chain, both beat analyst earnings estimates. [ID:nN17234410]
[ID:nN17114618]
 Wal-Mart's shares rose 1.21 percent to $51.02 while Home
Depot added 3.39 percent to $28.31.
 Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago,
warned that profits driven by cost-cutting at Wal-Mart did not
demonstrate underlying strength in the economy.
 ""The increase in M&A shows CEO's and CFO's have more
confidence in the outlook for the economy and are willing to
start to deploy some of the high cash balances, which have
built up in recent months,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief market
strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.
 Potash's U.S.-traded stock rose 27.65 percent to $143.17.

July for the first time in four months, helping to allay
concerns about deflation, but housing starts rose at a weaker

 In Europe, shares rose, with insurers among the biggest
gainers. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares
<.FTEU3> closed 1.1 percent higher at 1,056.54 points, ending
at its highest level in a week.
 Trading volumes, however, were low due to the holiday

FTSEurofirst 300.
 Insurer Aegon  rose 6.76 percent after the
European Union approved its recapitalization.
 The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> rose
1.04 percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> gained 1.11 percent.

 SOLID AUCTION
 Strong demand at Irish and Spanish bond auctions helped
boost the euro. Ireland's sale of 2014 and 2020 paper was
viewed as a litmus test for investor appetite amid concerns
about the cost of cleaning up the country's banking sector.
 The euro rose 0.42 percent to $1.2877  while the
greenback rose 0.16 percent to 85.50 yen . Against a
basket of currencies made up of its major trading partners, the
U.S. dollar fell 0.36 percent <.DXY>.
 The bond auctions overshadowed the influential German ZEW
report. Analyst and investor economic sentiment fell in August
to its lowest level since April 2009 on concerns a faltering
global economic recovery would hit Europe's largest economy.
 German government bonds fell with the 10-year yield pushing
up from a record low set in the previous session after the debt
sales eased funding worries in the euro zone periphery.
[ID:nLDE67F1IC] [ID:nDUB003219]
 The 10-year Bund yield  gained 3.7 basis
points to 2.36 percent, off an all-time low around 2.31 percent
plumbed on Monday.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 21/32 of point in
price, pushing the yield up to 2.64 percent  off
Monday's 17-month closing low of 2.57 percent.
 Gold rose on the weaker dollar and expectations of further
buying by investors concerned about the stuttering pace of
recovery. Spot gold  hit $1,228.45, its highest level
since July 1, before slipping to $1,224.55 an ounce, up $1.70.
 Oil rose from one-month lows but concerns linger that
demand could fall. U.S. light sweet crude oil  settled at
$75.77, up $0.53 per barrel. [ID:nN17149590]

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar and rebounded from a seven-week low against the yen on
Tuesday, as solid Irish and Spanish bond auctions eased
concerns about heavily indebted countries in the euro zone.
 But the euro struggled to hold above $1.29 amid uneasiness
about the bloc's economic outlook, with a key German survey
sparking concerns about whether Europe's largest economy can
sustain a solid recovery.
 ""We've seen a pretty choppy market and a lot of that has to
do just with all the mixed messages we've been getting today,""
said Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets in
Chicago.
 In late New York trading, the euro moved up 0.4 percent at
$1.2880, with key support at a one-month low around $1.2732 hit
on Monday, traders said.
 Ireland's sale of 2014 and 2020 paper was viewed as a
litmus test for investor appetite amid concerns about the cost
of cleaning up the country's banking sector. Sales of 12- and
18-month Spanish treasury bills also saw strong demand on
Tuesday.
 According to Reuters data, the euro touched a session high
of $1.2915 after the government bond auction results as
stop-losses were hit on the break of $1.2910.
 Analysts at Credit Agricole said while euro/dollar is
moving higher, momentum is waning while speculative positioning
reveals there's less room for short covering. ""A lot of good
news is in the price,"" they said in a note.
 The German ZEW institute's measure of investor and analyst
economic sentiment dropped well below forecasts, though the
move was partly offset by an unexpectedly sharp jump in the
current conditions index.
 There was little market impact from U.S. data on Tuesday
showing a rise in producer prices in July for the first time in
four months and a weaker-than-expected rise in housing starts,
although the data did ease some deflation concerns.
 A third report indicating U.S. industrial production
expanded in July at twice the clip expected helped the dollar
against the yen, market watchers said.
 ""Forex markets are just taking a breather after the violent
swings of last week in euro/dollar and dollar/yen,"" said
Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto. ""Traders are still looking for a catalyst to take the
dollar in one direction or the other.""
 YEN GAINS LIMITED -- FOR NOW
 The euro rose 0.6 percent against the yen to 110.09 yen.
 The dollar traded 0.2 percent higher at 85.49 yen though
analysts cautioned against reading too much into the move.
Earlier, the dollar slid to 85.11 yen on electronic trading
platform EBS, nearing a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit last
week.
 ""The sentiment out there is there are still problems to
come, and with the 10-year yield at 2.60 percent, there's
absolutely no reason for the dollar to rally against the yen
right now,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at
Forex.com, in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""We expect another run at
85 yen and then a move to the 84.70-80 area.""
 Further yen gains were capped by concerns about possible
moves by Japanese policymakers to stem the yen's rise. A
government source said Prime Minister Naoto Kan and the central
bank governor were likely to meet next Monday.
 When asked about the meeting, Kan told reporters: ""We have
been communicating with the BOJ in various ways as needed. We
hope to continue communicating as necessary with the central
bank.""
 One-week implied volatility for dollar/yen fell to around
11 on Tuesday from above 12 percent last week.

659,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2010 12:16PM ET</span>",Taiwan parliament approves landmark China trade deal," TAIPEI, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Taiwan's parliament passed a
trade deal with Beijing on Tuesday, the most significant
agreement between the political foes of 60 years and one that
binds Taiwan's economy to China while opening doors to other
countries.
 Legislators approved all but one sure-to-pass piece of the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) after a marathon
day of debate and colourful protests, meaning the deal becomes
law on Jan. 1. Negotiators initially signed the pact in June.
 Thee deal, which slashes tariffs on some 800 products, is
considered a catalyst for similar pacts with other countries
that could ease Taiwan's diplomatic isolation imposed by China
and raise its competitiveness as an export-dependent economy.
 The government has said the deal would create some 260,000
jobs, while one private forecast has put the net effect of ECFA
for Taiwan at a 5.3 percent improvement in GDP by 2020.
 China sees the deal as a step in its long-held plan to draw
Taiwan under its rule, charming the island with economic
sweeteners even as it continues a military build up against a
territory it has regarded as its own since the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949.
 As part of that charm offensive, Beijing is unlikely to stop
Taiwan from seeking deals with other trade partners to help its
economy. China's apparent blessing for a future pact with
Singapore, Taiwan's sixth largest trading partner, is a strong
first sign of agreements to come.
 Approval of the trade pact following a brawl last month in
the divided legislature also gives Taiwan negotiators a stronger
mandate to go back to the table with China for talks on further
tariff cuts and other economic cooperation deals.
 Opponents in Taiwan had feared that China wanted ECFA to
assert its claim of sovereignty over the self-ruled, democratic
island by making the economies more interdependent.
 Dozens of those opponents protested outside parliament on
Tuesday, with local television showing some in their underwear,
while opposition legislators yelled and displayed giant placards
during the debate.
 ""People are clear this isn't going to be good for Taiwan,""
lawmaker Chen Ming-wen told parliament. ""It's going to steer our
economy closer to China.""

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The euro rallied for a second
straight day against the U.S. dollar and rose from a seven-week

Spanish bond auctions alleviated concerns about heavily
indebted euro zone countries.

percent at $1.2875, with key support at a one-month low around
$1.2732 hit on Monday, traders said.
 The euro rose to a session high of $1.2915 after the
auction results as stop-losses were hit on the break of
$1.2910.
 Ireland comfortably sold its allocation of 2014 and 2020
bonds at bid-to-cover ratios of more than three times, easing
concerns about funding which had been worrying investors of
late. The yield on the 10-year paper fell from the last tender
a month ago.

 By Vuyani Ndaba
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Kenya's economy is poised
to expand by a median 3.9 percent in 2010 and 5.0 percent in
2011, bolstered by government spending, a dovish central bank
and regional trade, a poll of 10 economists and analysts showed.
 East Africa's biggest economy forecasts growth at 4.5
percent this year, after an expansion of 2.6 percent in 2009.
 ""In a change of momentum, growth is forecast to recover in
2010-11 as the global economy begins to lift its head, which in
turn will buoy tourism and export earnings and improve access to
external financing for the East African nation,"" said Thalma
Corbett, Chief Economist at NKC Independent Economists.
 ""Government's countercyclical fiscal expansion, combined
with the Central Bank of Kenya's loose monetary policy stance,
will also support economic growth.""
 Treasury has budgeted to spend over 321 billion shillings on
development projects this fiscal year, the highest allocation
for expansion in Kenya yet.
 Softer food prices on the back of good rains also bode well
for a benign inflation environment, Corbett said.
 The survey predicts the rate of inflation will end at 4.3
percent in 2010, and creep up throughout 2011 to 6.3 percent.
 ""The inflation rate has now been squeezed until the pips
have squeaked and hence I expect it has now bottomed out and
points higher,"" said Aly Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based
independent analyst.
 The inflation rate has dropped to a low of 3.2 percent this
year in June, but ticked up to 3.6 percent in July.
 Low inflation has enabled the central bank to keep its
easing stance on monetary policy, with seven cuts in the
benchmark CBR in the last 20 months. The latest cut was by 75
basis points to 6.0 percent.
 
 SOUND FISCAL MANAGER
 Analysts said a sharp drop in government bond yields has
bolstered their confidence in the government's ability and
willingness to follow through with stimulatory development
projects.
 They said the cost of borrowing would eventually creep back
up but appetite for Kenyan fixed income assets would remain
strong, enabling the government to continue funding expansion.
 This year, the East African Community's (EAC) common market
came into effect, placing Kenya at an advantage. The country is
the regional entry point through its port at Mombasa, it has the
deepest financial markets and a relatively developed
manufacturing base.
 The poll also showed the fiscal deficit at 6.0 percent of
GDP in 2010 and 5.5 percent in 2011. Analysts expected the
current account deficit at 6.6 percent this year and 6.1 percent
in the following year.
 Kenya budgeted a deficit of 6.8 percent for the year ending
June 2011, making it reliant on foreign direct investment and
external debt to meet its financing shortfalls.
 Analysts anticipate the balance of trade will remain skewed
towards imports as Kenya is still dependent on raw agricultural
commodities for export receipts.
 The current account deficit shrank to $1.072 billion in the
12 months to March from a deficit of $2.155 billion a year
earlier. 
 The central bank maintains that the current account deficit,
although high at about 6.5 percent of GDP, is sustainable,
underpined by recovery in sectors like tourism and remittances,
lower food imports and higher exports to the Far East and the
EAC.
 ""We consider Kenya's commitment to another round of deficit
spending for the development of infrastructure, energy
production, transportation and agriculture as a sound
investment,"" said Business Monitor International's Lisa Lewis.
 ""However, if maintained in the longer term the government
could damage its credibility as a sound fiscal manager.""

 By Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala
 DAR ES SALAAM, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Tanzania's economy should
grow 6.3 percent this year and 6.8 percent in 2011, thanks to
robust activity in all sectors, while inflation will stay in
single digits through to 2011, a Reuters poll of nine economists
showed on Tuesday.
 A previous poll in March had projected economic growth of a
median of 5.1 percent in 2010.
 The east African economy mainly depends on tourism, mining
and agriculture and is increasingly attracting more investor
interest in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing, financial
services and transport.
 ""Across the board, all sectors of Tanzania's economy are
expected to pick up pace this year and in 2011,"" said Thalma
Corbett, chief economist at NKC Independent. 
 ""Overall though, entrenched constraints such as poor energy
supply and transport infrastructure, in addition to excessive
bureaucracy, will keep growth below potential.""
 The government expects economic output to grow by 7.0
percent in 2010, from 6.0 percent last year.
 The International Monetary Fund sees Tanzania's economy
growing 6.7 percent in 2011, compared with an estimated 6.2
percent this year. It expects growth to accelerate to 7.5
percent by 2012/13.
 ""Our core view is for strong economic growth given the fact
that Tanzania's relatively stable political climate and abundant
natural resources should see foreign private sector investment
continue to flow in,"" said Matthew Searle of Business Monitor
International.
 Analysts said one impediment to growth was Tanzania's
reliance on foreign donors to support its fiscal budget. In the
2010/11 (July-June), 28 percent of its 11.6 trillion shilling
($7.95 billion) budget will come from foreign loans and aid.
 
 WIDE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT
 Consumer price inflation is expected to average 8.0 percent
in 2010 and 7.7 percent in 2011, according to the poll.
 Tanzania's annual inflation rate fell to 6.3 percent in July
from 7.2 percent in June, helped by lower food prices.
 ""Since October 2009 inflation has pursued a clear downward
trajectory, with the slowing of food inflation taking most of
the credit for overall inflation falling,"" said Corbett.
 The government aimed to have inflation below 6 percent by
June. The IMF expects inflation to ease to 5.0 percent by the
end of June 2011.
 Analysts say Tanzania's current account deficit is forecast
to widen to 8.0 percent of GDP in 2010, and to 9.2 percent next
year, but the rising price of gold on the world market should
cushion costly oil imports.
 Gold export earnings in Africa's third largest producer rose
15.4 percent in 2009 to $1.1 billion.
 Tanzania's current account deficit widened to $2.63 billion
in the year to June, from $2.53 billion in the same period a
year ago, according to the latest Bank of Tanzania figures.
 ""A sustained reduction in donor financing could place
pressure on the country's balance of payments position,"" Searle
said.
 The budget's fiscal deficit is expected to stand at -5.1
percent of GDP this year, and shrinking slightly to -5.0 percent
of GDP in 2011, according to the poll.

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The euro rallied for the
second straight day against the U.S. dollar and rose from a
7-week lows against the yen on Tuesday, bolstered by Irish and
Spanish bond auctions that alleviated concerns about heavily
indebted euro zone countries.
 Ireland's sale of 2014 and 2020 paper was viewed as a
litmus test for investor appetite amid concerns about the cost
of cleaning up its banking sector. Sales of 12- and 18-month
Spanish treasury bills also met strong demand. [ID:nLDE67G0M1]
 U.S. data indicating producer prices rose in July for the
first time in four months [ID:nN17122732] and a separate report
showing housing starts rose but to a much weaker rate than
expected in July had minimal impact on foreign exchange trading
[ID:nN16267366].
 ""Percolating sovereign debt issues in Europe continue to
come into play, lurking in the background,"" said John McCarthy,
director of foreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in
New York. The auctions ""remind us they have not gone away.""
 In early New York trade, the euro was up 0.4 percent at
$1.2870, with key support at a one-month low around $1.2732 hit
on Monday, traders said.
 The euro  rose to the day's high of $1.2915 after the
auction results as stop-losses were hit on the break of
$1.2910.
 Ireland comfortably sold its allocation of 2014 and 2020
bonds at bid-to-cover ratios of more than three times, easing
concerns about funding which had been worrying investors of
late. The yield on the 10-year paper fell from the last tender
a month ago.
 But the euro struggled to hold above $1.29 on uneasiness
about the economic outlook, with a key German survey sparking
concerns about whether Europe's largest economy can sustain a
solid recovery.
 The German ZEW institute's measure of investor and analyst
sentiment dropped well below forecasts, though this was partly
offset by an unexpectedly sharp jump in the current conditions
index. [ID:nDEG005695]
 ""Forex markets are just taking a breather after the
violent swings of last week in euro/dollar and dollar/yen,""
said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto. ""Traders are still looking for a catalyst to take the
dollar in one direction or the other.""
 YEN GAINS LIMITED FOR NOW
 The euro rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 109.87 yen
 erasing earlier losses.
 The dollar  was last little changed at 85.34 yen
after sliding to 85.11 yen in Asian trade on electronic trading
platform EBS , nearing a 15-year low of 84.72 yen hit
last week.
 Its fall came in the wake of Monday's slide in U.S.
Treasury yields, given the strong correlation between
U.S.-Japanese government bond yield spreads, which have been
narrowing, and the dollar/yen rate.
 Selling by Japanese exporters also weighed on the dollar,
traders said. Japanese exporters have been hurt more by the
fall in euro/yen, as they had been setting their budget targets
around 120-130 yen per euro this year.
 But further yen gains were capped by concerns about
possible moves by Japanese policymakers to stem the yen's rise.
A government source said Prime Minister Naoto Kan and the
central bank governor were likely to meet next Monday.
[ID:nECONJP]
 When asked about the meeting, Kan told reporters: ""We have
been communicating with the BOJ in various ways as needed. We
hope to continue communicating as necessary with the central
bank."" [ID:nTKB006993] One-week implied volatility for
dollar/yen  fell to around 11.15 on Tuesday from above
12 percent last week.
 ""The sentiment out there is there are still problems to
come, and with the 10-year yield at 2.60 percent, there's
absolutely no reason for the dollar to rally against the yen
right now,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at
Forex.com, in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""We expect another run at
85 yen and then a move to the 84.70-80 area.""

their overweight equity holdings in August while their cash
positions fell as global economic worries eased, a survey from
BofA Merrill Lynch showed on Tuesday.
 The monthly fund managers poll also showed investors became
overweight on European stocks for the first time since November
while their U.S. positions fell to the lowest since early 2008.
 According to the poll, investors' net equity overweight
position stood at 12 this month, compared with 11 percent in
July. This means the difference between overweights and
underweights is 12 percentage points. 
 The survey, which polled 187 fund managers who manage assets
totalling $513 billion, showed their average cash position fell
to 3.8 percent this month from 4.4 percent last month.
 Their cash overweight position fell further to 7 percent

from 15 percent last month.
 ""We call it a cautious and careful consensus. Bearishness we
saw in June and July has softened but the near-term outlook
remains neutral,"" said Patrick Schowitz, European equity
strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch.
 Fund managers turned overweight on euro zone equities with a
net 11 percent overweight. They became net 14 percent
underweight on the United States, the lowest level since January
2008. 
 They have turned almost neutral on the UK with a net 2
percent underweight, which is the most positive reading since
May 2007.
 ""The U.S. has become the focus of global growth worries.
Investors have realised Europe is less bad,"" Schowitz said.
 Risk appetite among hedge funds also improved. Their net
exposure to equity markets -- measured as long minus short as a
percentage of capital -- rose to 22 percent from 18 percent,
which was the lowest level since March 2009.
 The ratio of gross assets held by hedge funds relative to
their capital stood at 1.16, compared with 1.15, indicating that
their leverage level remained steady.
 Global emerging markets remained the most preferred region
with a net 38 percent overweight, although they were off extreme
overweight levels of 53 percent seen last November.
 A net 62 percent of investors view the yen as overvalued,
which is the highest reading on record.

 (Adds more comments in paragraph 8-10 )
 
 By Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 17 (Reuters) - South African public sector
unions on Tuesday rejected a revised government pay offer and
said they planned a mass strike from Wednesday that will bring
public services to a halt in Africa's largest economy.
 Analysts however expect a deal to be reached before a
coalition of unions, representing 1.3 million civil servants
including police, customs officials, teachers and health
workers, stages a prolonged stoppage that could damage commerce
and trade.
 ""From tomorrow there will be a total shutdown and the
beginning of a protracted strike and we will only stop when
government responds,"" said Thobile Ntola, president of the SADTU
teachers' union, a part of the labour coalition.
The strike threat by unions in the country's largest
umbrella labour group COSATU increases pressure on the
government to improve its terms or risk what could be the worst
strike by state workers for three years.
 Economists worry that whatever deal is reached will swell
state spending as the government tries to bring its deficit down
from 6.7 percent of gross domestic product.
 Last week the government offered to increase the monthly
housing allowance to 700 rand ($97) from a previous offer of 630
rand, but refused to increase its wage rise offer of 7 percent.
 The housing allowance alone would be equal to about 1
percent of government spending. 
 Unions and government negotiators are due to meet late on
Tuesday when workers will again push their demand of an 8.6
percent pay rise, more than double the inflation rate, and 1,000
rand for housing.
 The government had previously said it could not afford to
increase its offer and has threatened to unilaterally impose the
increase.
 ""Should they dare do that, that will be a war. We will
report for duty but will do no work and the public service will
come to standstill,"" said Ntola.
 There is pressure on both sides to reach a deal.
 A one-day strike last week did little to hurt the economy.
Union sources said there are cracks in the labour coalition with
some groups looking favourably on the latest offer, which could
diminish the impact of any potential strike.
 The ruling African National Congress has a long-standing
alliance with unions forged in the fight to end apartheid and
has often struck deals tilted in their favour so as not to lose
votes from a traditional base.
 But the government also has said it cannot afford the
demands and will be forced to cut spending elsewhere.
This could erode support for President Jacob Zuma's
government, which has already faced protests from the poor, who
say it has not done enough to supply them with electricity,
running water and better schools.
 A mid-grade public sector employee makes on average 8,800
rand ($1,200) a month in salary and benefits, above the national
average wage of 6,383 rand, according to government figures.

Argentina
 * Rains seen having little impact on drought-hit Russia crop
 * U.S. wheat prices lifted from 2-week low
 
 By Pavel Polityuk and Sherine ElMadany
 KIEV/CAIRO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Ukraine will halve its 2010
grain exports, adding pressure to markets already grappling with
Russia's drought-induced grain export ban, while the world's top
wheat buyer Egypt remains set on importing 6 million tonnes.
 Egypt, which had previously depended on Black Sea supply for
some 63 percent of its imports, says it has already replaced
most of the wheat it was unable to buy after Russia's ban and is
spreading the net wider to find other supplies.
 Ukraine, the world's largest exporter of barley and
sixth-largest of wheat, plans to limit grain exports to 2.5
million tonnes for the remainder of the year, Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk was quoted as saying. A final
decision will be taken on Wednesday.
 ""Grain traders were on their knees saying: 'Save us and give
us force majeure',"" Interfax quoted Deputy Prime Minister Viktor
Slauta as saying on Tuesday. 
 That follows the sweeping move by neighbouring Russia to ban
all grain exports as crops shrivel and wildfires spring up in
its worst drought in more than a century.
 An industry source had told Reuters earlier Ukraine would
also limit wheat and barley exports 2.5 million tonnes in the
rest of the marketing season from January to June next year.
 ""This volume (of quotas) will be considered by the
government (at the Aug. 18 meeting),"" said the source at a
Western grain trading company who asked not to be named.
 Worries about damage caused to wheat in the Black Sea
region, which has emerged as a key exporter to global markets,
pushed benchmark U.S. wheat to a near two-year high recently,
even though the outlook for crop problems into 2011 is tempered
by ample stockpiles.
 Front month wheat futures were up 1.13 percent at $6.71 per
bushel by 1513 GMT, partially recovering from a slide induced in
the previous session by forecasts for rain in Russia.
 National weather forecasting service data showed on Tuesday
however that periodic rains and thunderstorms on Aug. 17-19 are
unlikely to bring relief to European Russia.
 The Black Sea region includes three of the world's top ten
wheat exporters and has been a well used source for several of
the world's most reliant importers including top buyer Egypt.
 Drought in North Africa has also slashed harvest forecasts
in that importing region. Tunisia's harvest was forecast at 1.1
million tonnes, half last year's level, the state news agency
reported.
 Algeria's state grains agency put the country's 2010 harvest
below last year's 6.1 million tonnes, though stocks of durum
wheat and barley were sufficient to avert imports. 
 
 EGYPT COVERS SUPPLY, SPREADS NET
 Hot speculation has surrounded the possible strategies to be
taken by Egypt, due to its regular large forays into
international markets.
 Traders had told Reuters earlier that Russia was not
expected to honour export deals agreed before but for delivery
after Aug.15, the date it halted shipments of grain abroad.
 But trade minister Rachid Mohamed Rachid said the country
was well down the road to covering recent deals.
 ""We have already replaced most of the quantities that were
contracted with Russia... Egypt is continuously in the market,""
Rachid said.
 Egypt has purchased 360,000 tonnes of French wheat since
Russia's export ban was announced. It needs to replace more than
500,000 tonnes of Russian wheat purchases affected by the ban.
 On Tuesday it bought 55,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat from
Cargill in a tender that excluded both Russia and Ukraine in
favour of North American and European suppliers.
 Asked if Egypt was considering new origins for wheat beside
the United States, France and Canada following the Russian ban,
Rachid told Reuters: ""There are seven or eight wheat suppliers
globally. Argentina is one of them....it's a big supplier.
 ""We had negotiations with Argentina, a discussion on an
official level and a private-sector level,"" he said. ""We're
happy to see Argentina added to our list of suppliers.""

 The euro  rose to the day's high of $1.2915 after the

 ""The much weaker-than-expected ZEW, which likely reflects

(Adds minister comments on Russia talks, details, background)
 By Shaimaa Fayed and Sherine El Madany
 CAIRO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Egypt may resume wheat imports
from Argentina after a hiatus of several years to help
compensate for Russia's ban on exports, Trade Minister Rachid
Mohamed Rachid said on Tuesday.
 A severe drought has sharply reduced grain production
throughout the Black Sea region and prompted Russia, the
region's top exporter, to ban grain shipments until at least the
end of the year.
 In an interview with Reuters, Rachid said Egypt still aimed
to import 6 million tonnes of wheat in 2010-2011 and was well on
the way to replacing all the Russian wheat it had agreed to buy
before the ban.
 Egypt is the world's largest wheat importer, and Russia was
the supplier of choice in most of its foreign wheat tenders in
the past year.
 Asked if Egypt was considering new origins for wheat beside
the United States, France and Canada, Rachid told Reuters:
""There are seven or eight wheat suppliers globally. Argentina is
one of them ...it's a big supplier.""
 He said he had held talks with Argentine government and
private sector officials two weeks ago during a visit to sign a
free trade agreement with Mercosur countries.
 ""We're happy to see Argentina added to our list of
suppliers,"" he said, adding that imports could begin ""with the
next crop"".
 
 DIVERSIFY
 In the fiscal year to June 30, 2010, Egypt's main wheat
buying agency GASC bought 5.53 million tonnes of U.S., French,
Russian, German, Kazakh and Canadian wheat at international
tenders. 
 Some 63 percent of its wheat came from the Black Sea region.
 ""We are serious about keeping our diversification of
sources,"" said Rachid. ""That's the way to do it.""
 Rachid said Russia's government had agreed to examine ways
to reschedule supplies from Oct. 1 but would not be in a
position to take any decision on shipments before then.
 ""Of course the ban is on until the end of December. But
(Russia) made it clear that for us, after Oct. 1, they will give
us an assessment of what they could or could not do, because by
that time they will have the best estimate of their production
and quantities, which they don't have at the moment.""
 Rachid said Egypt would allow more than one shipment port
for its wheat suppliers ""if we feel that such change of
conditions will make supply easier without posing risks.""
 He said, ""We do not have at the moment any specific needs to
change our regulations"" regarding changing shipment terms for
wheat traders.
 A decision on whether to allow wheat suppliers to use more
than one shipment port would be implemented ""very soon, possibly
starting with the next tender"", he added.

 By Helen Nyambura
 NAIROBI, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Kenya's Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE) plans a segment for small- and mid-capital companies
within the next year and targets admitting 100 new firms to the
bourse by 2015, an exchange executive said on Tuesday.
 The NSE is counting on small- and mid-cap firms -- those
with no more than 1 billion shillings ($12.4 million) in annual
revenue -- to fuel trading amid hopes a new Kenyan constitution
will provide stable conditions in east Africa's largest economy.
 The bourse at present has 55 listed companies. At the close
of trade on Monday, total market capitalisation stood at
1,156.12 billion shillings, up from 1,146.61 billion on Friday.
 Peter Mwangi, NSE's chief executive, told reporters the
bourse saw strong potential from small- and mid-cap companies.
""We expect that segment will be more active than the main
segment,"" he said.
 ""We would like to have it up and running sooner, but 12
months is realistic,"" he said, adding the bourse expected to add
100 more companies in the next five years.
 Companies will be able to issue both debt and equity.
 There has been growing interest in investing in stocks and
treasury and corporate bonds on the NSE. Recent initial public
offerings and bond issues have been oversubscribed.
 Mwangi said bond turnover on the exchange for the first
seven months of 2010 was 338 billion shillings, compared with
110.6 billion shillings for all of 2009, largely due to the
automation of bond trade last year.
 He forecast a nine-year government infrastructure bond that
went on sale this month seeking to raise 31.6 billion shillings
would be oversubscribed because its coupon is not taxed.
 Mwangi said most foreign participation on the NSE was from
European and South African investors.
 Kenya's benchmark 20-share index rallied after voters
endorsed the new constitution this month, peaking at 4,674.31
points. It closed on Monday at 4,524.80.
 The new law is expected to give a lift to business activity,
and in turn, activity on the bourse.
 ""Things are looking up. Part of the setbacks were to do with
the political environment. Now we have the supporting structures
right,"" Mwangi said.

 FACTORS TO WATCH:
 - Exports probably increased 36.9 percent in July from a
year before, growing for the ninth straight month, according to
the poll, after June's rise of 46.3 percent.
 The expected slower growth is probably due to the base
effect in comparison with last year. Global demand improved
around the middle of last year, after plunging during the
global crisis.
 - Exports have been little affected by euro zone debt
problems; the euro zone took 9.7 percent of Thai goods in June,
up from 9.3 percent in May.
 - Imports probably increased 32.1 percent in July from a
year before, the lowest since December, after June's 37.9
percent. Import growth is also good for exports as many imports
are used to make re-exported goods.
 MARKET IMPACT:
 - A stronger-than-expected increase in exports and imports
would show Thailand's economic recovery is being sustained and
further support the baht , which climbed to a 28-month
high on Tuesday.
 - If the trade data is sharply weaker than expected, the
central bank may be more reluctant to raise interest rates in
coming months and that could lift bond prices.
 - The central bank lifted its key policy rate last month by
a quarter point to 1.50 percent, the first increase since the
global downturn, saying inflationary pressure had increased as
the economy rebounds. [ID:nSGE65103A].

 By Aaron Gray-Block
 AMSTERDAM, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Dutch biotech group Crucell
swung to a second-quarter net profit as it benefited from
production problems at one of its key rivals, and it raised its
full-year guidance on expected new orders for its vaccines.
 Crucell was upbeat on prospects for its paediatric vaccine
Quinvaxem after rival Sanofi-Aventis's (SASY.PA) Shantha
Biotechnics was forced to recall its vaccines and lost in July a
prequalification status to supply the World Health Organisation.
 ""The production of Quinvaxem is in order. The production was
not in order at one of our competitors. We are positive for
Quinvaxem for the coming year,"" Crucell Chief Executive Ronald
Brus said in a conference call.
 He added the company expects a new contract from UNICEF in
the second half of the year and although there are strains on
its production capacity, he did not expect problems with supply.
 Crucell reported second-quarter net profit of 9.2 million
euros, beating the average estimate of 8.8 million euros from a
Reuters poll of four analysts. The company made a first-quarter
net loss of 2.3 million euros.
 The SmartEstimate for net profit based from StarMine, which
rates analysts based on past accuracy and timeliness, was for
9.37 million euros.
 Crucell said it expects total 2010 revenues and other
operating income to exceed 2009, having previously guided for
revenues and other operating income to be in line with 2009.
 Although RBS analyst Mutlu Gundogan said Crucell's
second-quarter revenue growth was good, he noted the raised
outlook was expected and the gross margin ""disappointed.""
 Crucell said its gross margin was 36 percent, down 39
percent last year, hit by foreign exchange movements.
 Expenses also rose due to higher direct marketing and sales
expenses, IT project expenses and one-time effects.
 Shares in Crucell were up 0.9 percent at 15.87 euros at 0812
GMT, slightly outperforming a a positive Amsterdam midcap index
. Crucell shares have risen 5.6 percent in the past month.
 Johnson & Johnson bought a 17.96 percent stake in Crucell
last year, giving the Leiden-based company a strong cash
position and the ability to make acquisitions.
 Crucell said it would aim to apply for licensing in 2014 of
its cell-based influenza vaccine programme after reaching an
agreement with French group Sanofi-Aventis for the return of
full control over the development of the programme.

 * Maize exports unlikely to be restricted-traders
(Adds details, background)
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Ukraine plans to more than halve
its barley and wheat exports in the current season compared with
last year, an industry source said on Tuesday, after severe
winter frosts and a scorching summer ruined tracts of its crops.
 Ukraine, the world's largest exporter of barley and
sixth-largest of wheat, is due to make a final decision on
quotas on Wednesday, following a move by neighbouring Russia
which has banned all grain exports due to a severe drought that
is afflicting key grain producers in the Black Sea region.
 Worries about the wheat crop in the Black Sea region pushed
global prices to a near two-year high recently, as the region
contains three of the world's top ten wheat exporters.
 The industry source told Reuters Ukraine will limit wheat
and barley exports to 2.5 million tonnes this year and another
2.5 million tonnes in the rest of the marketing season from
January to June next year.
 ""This volume (of quotas) will be considered by the
government (at the Aug. 18 meeting),"" said the source at a
Western grain trading company who asked not to be named.
 The Agriculture Ministry declined to comment. Traders have
said the quota is likely to apply to wheat and barley but not
maize which also accounts for a significant share of Ukraine's
exports.
 In the 2009/2010 marketing season which runs from July to
June, Ukraine exported 9.3 million tonnes of wheat and 6.2
million tonnes of barley. It exported 224,630 tonnes of wheat
and 414,372 tonnes of barley in July.
 This means the quota, likely to take effect next month, will
limit Ukraine's combined wheat and barley sales in the current
season to less than half of the previous season's volume.
 The worst drought in more than a century may cut Russia's
grain output by 40 percent this year.
 Leading Russian agricultural analyst SovEcon said on Monday
it cut its 2010 grain crop forecast to 59.5-63.5 million tonnes
from a previous forecast of 70-75 million tonnes, a day after
Russia's first grain export ban for 11 years kicked in.
 Coming after Russia's bumper 97 million tonne crop last
year, the drought has destroyed crops over large areas, sparking
wildfires which have shrouded Moscow in smog for days, and
forcing up world grain prices. 
 U.S. wheat futures rose nearly 1 percent on Tuesday, partly
recovering after a 5.5 percent slide to a two-week low in the
previous session on forecasts of rain in Russia.

 * Oil prices rise again on Middle East tension
 * China raises bank reserve requirements
 * Dollar slightly stronger versus euro
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - World shares fell back after
hitting fresh 30-month highs on Friday against a background of
rising oil prices and new attempts by China to curb its
inflation pressures.
 Wall Street looked set to open flat.
 Brent crude rose close to $103 a barrel as unrest spreading
across the Middle East fanned fears of a supply disruption in
the major oil-producing region.
 China underlined investor concern about rising global
inflation, fuelled now by rising oil prices, by raising lenders'
required reserves by 50 basis points.
 In Paris, China was said to be dragging its feet over
efforts by G20 states to agree ways of measuring and correcting
imbalances in the world economy, resisting the inclusion of
indicators on currency rates and reserves.
 China has also increased interest rates three times in the
past four months and ordered banks to issue fewer loans. But its
annual inflation still rebounded to 4.9 percent in January from
4.6 percent a month earlier.
 One impact on Friday was to take put a brake on a global
rally in stocks that has driven world shares up around 5
percent, with developed market indexes such as the U.S. S&P 500
, Japanese Nikkei 225 and European FTSEurofirst 300 gaining
between 5.8 and 6.6 percent.
 The MSCI all-country world stock index was barley higher
after earlier hitting a fresh 30-month high.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 was flat after rising for five
consecutive sessions. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei closed up with
tiny gains.
 Investors have been pouring into stocks, attracted by higher
earnings and a view that the world economy is on track for solid
growth.
 ""There is just a greater conviction in the more promising
outlook in global economic growth,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief
strategist at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.
 ""We are moving from recovery phase to a sustainable
expansion.""
 The flip side of the growth picture, however, is rising
inflation, which may soon come to eat into corporate margins and
prompt central banks to tighten abundant money supply, as China
is doing.
 
 INFLATION
 So oil prices -- and their impact on global inflation --
remained in focus as protestors in Bahrain and Libya bury people
killed in recent clashes.
 In Libya's eastern city of Benghazi early on Friday,
thousands of anti-government protesters crowded on to the
streets, a day after demonstrations led to skirmishes with
security forces in which more than 20 people may have been
killed.
 Tension between Israel and Iran also continued over the
latter's plans to send navy ships through the Suez Canal, a move
that Israel has called a ""provocation"".
 ""Short-term geopolitical nervousness will continue to
underpin Brent prices, but in terms of fundamentals, support
will come from the gradually recovering U.S. economy and the
ongoing momentum in China,"" said David Cohen, director at Action
Economics in Singapore. 
 Rising inflation, meanwhile, was underlined by German
producer prices for January exceeding forecasts to post their
strongest year-on-year rise since October 2008, up 5.7 percent.
 On foreign exchange markets, the euro slipped due to ongoing
speculation European officials will struggle to agree on how to
strengthen the euro zone's defences against debt problems.
 The single currency was pressured after figures showed
emergency overnight borrowing at the European Central Bank
remained exceptionally high, highlighting concerns about the
health of euro zone banks.
 The dollar recovered losses as investors took a breather
from selling before a U.S. market holiday. The euro traded 0.4
percent lower on the day at $1.3555.
 Sterling meanwhile rose against both currencies on market
talk that another member of the Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee had moved into the hawks' camp by voting for a
rate rise in February.
 Minutes of the February meeting, at which the bank left
rates on hold at a record low of 0.5 percent despite rising
inflation, are due for release on Wednesday.
 Concerns Portugal may need a bailout -- possibly by April --
dominated euro zone sovereign bond markets, with the yield on
the country's five-year debt hitting a euro-era peak for a
second session running.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2010 04:56AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China boosts yuan's overseas use via bond market moves," * Foreign banks with yuan derived from trade may buy bonds
 * Aim is to spur use of cross-border yuan trade settlement
 * Fresh step in raising yuan's international profile
 BEIJING, Aug 17 (Reuters) - China took a new step on Tuesday
to promote the use of the yuan beyond its borders, a strategic
initiative to raise the global profile of the currency while
retaining capital controls to shield its economy from
speculators.
 China will allow yuan accumulated overseas as a result of
trade settlement or central bank swaps to be funnelled back into
the mainland's interbank bond market, the People's Bank of China
said.
 The central bank said the move aimed to boost China's
fledgling programme to encourage the use of the yuan in settling
trade, thus broadening the international role of the currency.
 Economists have identified a paucity of investment outlets as
one obstacle in the way of a faster build-up of yuan balances
under a year-old scheme to invoice and settle imports and exports
in yuan, also called the renminbi, rather than dollars.
 ""So far, progress has involved allowing renminbi that is
already offshore to do whatever is wanted, so long as it doesn't
flow back into China. Now it has taken it one step further, and
that is to open a small channel that allows some of the offshore
yuan to flow back into the mainland system,"" said Kelvin Lau, an
economist with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong.
 He said the announcement was a small step in the right
direction -- a natural progression.
 ""This creates more usages for the renminbi in Hong Kong and
outside of mainland China, so it is the right step to try to
create more usages for the yuan and therefore create more demand
for the yuan,"" he said.
 In a statement on its website, www.pbc.gov.cn, the central
bank said three kinds of financial institutions would be
permitted to invest surplus yuan in the mainland's interbank bond
market:
 -- yuan clearing banks in Hong Kong and Macau;
 -- foreign central banks that have signed yuan swap
agreements with China; there are seven to date, totalling just
over 800 billion yuan. For a factbox [IDnTOE66M03V]
 -- overseas banks involved in yuan cross-border trade
settlement; the scheme was extended in June to every country in
the world and, inside China, to 20 provinces and cities with
provincial status. [ID:nTOE65G079]
 ""In a sense, it is a very small opening of the capital
account given that it really does allow money to go into the
capital market, the bond market in this case. But for the money
to leave China in the first place, it is through trade or through
swap lines, which is a very managed way,"" Lau said.

vet the amount of foreign-made components in goods produced on
French soil and may introduce a law to ensure firms use more
domestic suppliers, Industry Minister Christian Estrosi said.
 Speaking on RMC radio, Estrosi said the steps were aimed at
supporting ""French industrial patriotism"" at a time when many
big companies in France were ""not behaving very well"" by using
inputs from abroad.
 ""(In September) I will set up a new monitoring agency for
French products to ensure ... a percentage of the components for

said.
 ""What is important is the number of components, to ensure
that the large majority come from French suppliers. All this

 Unemployment in France is hovering around 10 percent and
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who faces an election in 2012, is
under pressure to show results on the economy.
 Earlier this year, both Sarkozy and Estrosi tried to
pressure managers at carmaker Renault  to centre
production of the company's new Clio 4 small car in France, but
were unsuccessful.
 Estrosi said the government wanted to organise a new
relationship between producers and suppliers on an
industry-by-industry basis, mentioning the car, aerospace,
energy, biotechnology and luxury goods sectors.

 ZURICH, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Loss-making Swiss technology
group Oerlikon said it would return to profit next year, sending
shares higher.
 The company, in which Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg
holds a major stake, posted a first-half net loss of 50 million
Swiss francs, compared with a loss of 99 million a year earlier.

 The results were the company's first under new chief
executive Michael Buscher, who is overhauling the company's
business.
 ""In the second half of the year we will be profitable before
restructuring costs and next year also at a group level,""
Buscher told Reuters.
 At 0754 GMT shares in the company, which have lost more than
half their value in the past year, were up 6 percent at 4.41
francs, outperforming a 0.5 percent rise in the Swiss midcap
index.
 Oerlikon, which makes the coatings used in Formula One

1 billion franc rights issue earlier this year as part of a debt
restructuring scheme.
 ""We welcome the clear strategic message regarding the
group's business portfolio and segment structure, as well as the
focus on profitability rather than growth,"" said Vontobel
analyst Michael Foeth.
 The company, founded more than 100 years ago, had to
renegotiate a 2.5 billion franc syndicated loan it took to
refinance the purchase of car parts and machinery maker Saurer
in 2006 and also suffered a sharp drop in orders during the
global recession.

unions planned to announce on Tuesday whether they will accept a
revised government wage offer or renew their threat of a mass
strike they say will bring public services to a halt.
 Analysts expect a deal to be reached before a coalition of
unions, representing 1.3 million civil servants including
police, customs officials, teachers and health workers, stages a
prolonged stoppage.
 Union officials have hinted they might reject the latest
offer, which would increase pressure on the government to
improve its terms or risk what could be the worst strike by
state workers for three years.
 Unions in the country's largest labour umbrella group COSATU
said they would hold a news conference to announce their
decision at 11:45 a.m. (0945 GMT). 
 Economists worry that whatever deal is reached will swell
state spending as the government tries to bring its deficit down

 Last week the government offered to increase the monthly
housing allowance to 700 rand ($95.70) from a previous offer of
630 rand, but refused to increase its wage rise offer of 7
percent.
 The housing allowance alone would be equal to about 1
percent of government spending.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a 15-year
low against the yen on Tuesday, weighed down by a slide in U.S.
Treasury yields, putting the focus on whether Japanese
authorities will take any measures to curb the yen's rise.
 The dollar dipped as low as 85.11 yen in early Asian trade,
within sight of a 15-year low of 84.72 yen struck last week on
trading platform EBS.
 Its fall came in the wake of the previous day's slide in U.S.
Treasury yields, while selling by Japanese exporters at around
the 0100 GMT Tokyo fixing also weighed on it, traders said.
 The yen's gains were limited, however, with traders reluctant
to push the currency higher as they waited to see if the
government or the Bank of Japan will take new steps to rein in
its export-sapping strength.
 Helping to reinforce such caution, a government source said
Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa are likely to meet next Monday.
 The meeting may be brought forward to later this week, the
source said, depending on market developments.
 ""There is a trend of dollar weakness stemming from moves in
U.S. Treasuries, but the yen has reached danger levels so it's
becoming a little hard to chase it higher,"" said a trader for a
Japanese trust bank.
 Outright yen-selling intervention seems unlikely, although
the chances of that cannot be ruled out, for example if the yen's
rise gains more steam or the benchmark Nikkei share average
slides below 9,000, the trader said.
 The more likely response from Japanese authorities would be
some form of monetary easing by the BOJ, the trust bank trader
said.
 The dollar held steady against the yen from late U.S. trading
on Monday at 85.32 yen.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield dived more than 10
basis points to hit a 17-month low of 2.563 percent on Monday,
according to Reuters data.
 There has been a strong correlation between U.S.-Japanese
government bond yield spreads, which have been narrowing, and the
dollar/yen rate.
 In the latest comments on the yen by a Japanese policymaker,
Economics Minister Satoshi Arai was quoted by Kyodo news agency
as saying the yen's rise may not cease with verbal intervention
alone, adding that its rise may be in the final stage.
 Former Japanese currency policy chief Hiroshi Watanabe said
Japan may step into the currency market, possibly on its own, if
the yen climbs about 3 yen against the dollar in a day.
 But he said Tokyo does not need to take action now to stem
the yen's strength, given that it is not rising rapidly.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a basket
of six major currencies, fell 0.4 percent to 82.248.
 The dollar index has near-term support at an Aug. 13 low of
82.182 and an Aug. 12 trough of 82.109, while resistance is seen
at a July 21 high of 83.451.
 The euro edged up 0.3 percent to $1.2862, pulling away from a
one-month low of $1.2732 hit the previous day on EBS.
 But analysts and traders said the euro remains vulnerable to
concerns about the health of Europe's banking sector and the
sovereign debt situation in peripheral economies
 The euro rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 109.75 yen after
striking a seven-week low of 109.07 yen earlier on Tuesday.
 ""A stronger yen, despite some dismal domestic data, is a sign
the market is calling for new policy steps by the BOJ,"" said
Hideki Hayashi, a global economist at Mizuho Securities.
 Japan's economy grew 0.1 percent in April-June, data showed
on Monday, slowing sharply from the previous two quarters.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2010 01:48AM ET</span>",China strikes a worry but no strategy change yet-execs," * Global firms concerned about China labour disputes
 * Do not see significant rise in overall China labour costs
 * See some benefits from wealthier factory workers
 By Dhara Ranasinghe
 SINGAPORE, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Labour disputes in China, the
workshop of the world, are prompting global firms to review
their China strategies, but are unlikely to deter them from
doing business there since overall costs should remain
contained, company executives say.
 A significant rise in the Chinese yuan may also add to
production costs, but greater spending power from Chinese
consumers will be positive in the long-term for companies
there, according to senior company officials spoken to by
Reuters.
 Walkouts in recent months have disrupted production at
factories in China supplying major foreign firms such as
Japanese car makers Toyota and Honda Motor Co.
 Danish brewer Carlsberg and U.S. industrial conglomerate
Ingersoll-Rand have also been hit by strikes from a more
assertive Chinese labour force -- triggering fears that global
firms will face higher wage costs, hurting profits in the long
run and discouraging them from doing business in China.
 ""It's a very important item and it's one that we're
monitoring carefully,"" said Dave Anderson, Chief Financial
Officer at U.S. manufacturer Honeywell International Inc.
 ""What it really argues for is continued flexibility as you
look for the best places to manufacture in the world.""
 Among the steps companies are taking to lessen the impact
are increasing their proportion of local managers and replacing
workers with machines where possible.
 ""This is a difficult problem, but it's an area Japanese
staff cannot deal with,"" said Nobuyuki Sugano, head of Chinese
operations at Japan's Sharp Corp.
 Chinese staff in management and personnel positions helped
to deal with problems more quickly, he said.
 ""Our labour costs are a small proportion of our total costs
-- raw materials are a more important factor for us. But since
labour costs are rising, we plan to use more automated and
semi-automated production to improve efficiency.""
 LABOUR COSTS SMALL BUT RISING
 Analysts say Chinese labour costs, even with the strikes,
are on a rising trend but are unlikely to dislodge China as a
dominant player in manufactured exports as labour costs remain
a fraction of the cost of goods made there.
 A top executive at Honda, which has been forced to suspend
production on and off at its four Chinese car factories since
late May as workers at local parts makers demanded higher
wages, said this month the automaker expects no lasting impact
on earnings from the labour disputes.
 While wages in China will rise by more than 10 percent, the
the impact on earnings was seen as minimal because labour costs
accounted for just 2 percent of total manufacturing costs
there, according to Honda's Chief Financial Officer Yoichi
Hojo.
 Junzo Nakakima, head of IT operations at Hitachi, Japan's
biggest electronics maker, said China production costs were a
factor for long-term consideration.
 ""But right now, I don't think it would rise something like
10 percent a year, so it is a matter we need to address in the
mid- to long-term.""
 The Hitachi group has about 50-60 factories in China,
according to a spokesman.
 NEED FOR CHANGE
 Still, the labour disruptions in China highlighted the need
to improve relations with the local workforce, executives said.
 ""Changing the way the supply chain works or anything else
doesn't address the fundamental issue,"" said Atsushi Niimi,
Executive Vice President at Toyota.
 ""The most important thing we can do is to make sure we have
a system in place that fosters good communication between the
workers and management.""
 Some executives viewed the strikes as part of China's
economic development and said higher wages among factory
workers would help fuel consumption, benefiting the global
economy.
 ""The recent strikes mean that living standards are
improving,"" said Hitachi's Nakajima.
 ""China has had an important role in lowering production
costs and it has also been a big market, but (the recent
movement) can be seen as a part of the process of it becoming a
more attractive market.""

attempts to reduce their holdings of the dollar and the euro.
 ""Overseas players are buying the yen with their eyes closed
until they have dissolved their overweight positions in the euro
and the dollar, but no one thinks the Japanese economy is in good
shape,"" Watanabe, now the head of the state-backed Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC), told Reuters in an interview.
 ""It will reverse its course before long.""
 Watanabe served as vice minister for international affairs
for three years until July 2007.
 Japan's authorities haven't intervened to protect exporters
from a strong currency since March 2004, when a 15-month yen
selling spree came to an end.
 Currency market intervention is seen as difficult, whether
jointly or alone, although market players say the risk of solo
action increases the closer the yen gets to 80 per dollar and if
its rise accelerates to a pace of 2 to 3 yen per day.

 TOKYO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped towards a
15-year low against the yen on Tuesday, pressured by a fall in
U.S. Treasury yields as worries about the U.S. recovery and the
global economy prompted investors to cut back risky positions.
 The dollar slid as low as 85.11 yen in early Asian trade,
within sight of a 15-year low of 84.72 yen reached last week.
 Traders said it is only matter of time before the greenback

 ""The dollar remains on a downtrend against the yen, though
the fall in the pair somewhat lacks momentum at the moment,"" said
a senior trader at a big Japanese bank.
 ""But the speed of the dollar's slide could pick up if data
offers new evidence of weakness in the U.S. economy, sparking a
stock sell-off and further buying of Treasuries,"" he said.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield dived more than 10
basis points to hit a 17-month low of 2.563 percent on Monday,
according to Reuters data.
 There has been a high-correlation between U.S.-Japanese
government bond yield spreads, which are now narrowing, and the
dollar/yen rate.
 The dollar stood at 85.28 yen, down nearly 0.1 percent from
the late U.S. trade on Monday.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against a basket
of six major currencies, dipped 0.1 percent to 82.476. It lost
0.6 percent the previous day as traders decided the currency's
huge 3.1 percent rally last week was overdone.
 The dollar inched down 0.1 percent to 85.28 yen.
 The euro barely budged, and was at $1.2820. It rose 0.6
percent against the dollar the previous day after falling almost
4 percent last week, its largest weekly drop since the week of
May 9.
 But analysts and traders said the euro remains vulnerable to
concerns about the health of Europe's banking sector and the
sovereign debt situation in peripheral economies
 The single European currency was down 0.1 percent at 109.34
after striking a seven-week low of 109.07 yen.

 (Adds background on Mexico's action, dispute)
WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United States is
""disappointed"" Mexico has decided to impose retaliatory duties
on additional U.S. goods in a dispute over cross-border
trucking, the top U.S. trade official said on Monday.
 ""Mexico is an important U.S. export market and President
(Barack) Obama understands the economic pain that these tariffs
cause for American farmers, companies and workers,"" U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement.
 ""We are committed to continuing to work with members of
Congress and our counterparts in Mexico to resolve the dispute
and end these duties,"" he said.
 Mexican officials said they were imposing additional
tariffs because of the slow U.S. response in resolving the
dispute, which stems from a commitment the United States made
in the North American Free Trade Agreement to open its market
to Mexican trucks.
 In 2009, Mexico slapped retaliatory duties on 89 U.S. goods
accounting for about $2.4 billion worth of trade, after the
U.S. Congress canceled a pilot program for long-haul Mexican
truckers started by former President George W. Bush.
 The new retaliation list has been expanded to include 99
products, including pork, a spokesman for Mexico's embassy in
Washington said. It will be published in coming days, he said.
 Kirk said he and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood have
been working other agencies and members of Congress to resolve
the dispute a way that upholds U.S. trade obligations, as well
as safety concerns raised by opponents of opening the U.S.
market to the Mexican truckers.
 LaHood told Senator Patty Murray on May 6 the Obama
administration would be announcing a proposal to fix the
dispute ""very soon.""
 Murray's home state of Washington, which Obama visits on
Tuesday, has been hit hard by the tariffs.

 TORONTO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slipped
against its U.S. counterpart on Monday after disappointing
economic signals out of Japan and the United States, and
flagging momentum in the domestic housing sector, pressured the
currency despite broad weakness in the greenback.
 The Canadian dollar underperformed across the board,
following a series of soft economic releases, including a very
slight growth figure out of Japan, falling U.S. home builder
sentiment and a U.S. Federal Reserve survey that illustrated
stagnant business and consumer loan demand.
 ""When you look at the performance of the Canadian dollar,
it seems to be displaying a very stubborn independent streak
where it's lower against the U.S. dollar, whereas relative to
all the other currencies, the U.S. dollar has depreciated.""
said David Tulk, senior macro strategist at TD Securities.
 Also weighing on the domestic currency, data showed sales
of existing homes in Canada fell 6.8 percent in July, almost
entirely because of fewer sales in the big provinces of British
Columbia and Ontario. [ID:nN16264769]
 ""I think markets should be able to see through that but it
doesn't seem they're quite willing to do so at this point,""
added Tulk, referring to last month's introduction of
harmonized federal and provincial sales taxes in both
provinces.
 ""The fact that the housing market does have this
connotation of being a dangerous part of the economy to be
correcting, I think maybe markets are focusing on that in terms
of Canada.""
 Wary investors also struggled to keep equity markets in
positive territory, while crude oil futures ended lower for a
fifth consecutive day.
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0446 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.73 U.S. cents,
down from Friday's finish at C$1.0415 to the U.S. dollar, or
96.02 U.S. cents.
 Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets said key technical levels to watch going forward would
be an intraday level of C$1.0499 and a daily close of the
C$1.0503 double-top and C$1.0503, a descending channel.
 ""Until we break above those levels I think we'll most
likely continue to see a range trading broadly speaking around
the C$1.04 level,"" said Strauss.
 ""However, a break above those two levels as a daily close
would clearly indicate that there is new momentum to sell the
Canadian dollar.""
 On the support side for the currency, Strauss said breaking
beyond the 200-day moving average of C$1.0390 could see the
Canadian dollar back towards C$1.0111.
 BONDS FOLLOW TREASURIES UP
 Canadian government bond prices firmed, following U.S.
Treasury issues higher, with the U.S. 10-year yield hitting a
17-month low as weak economic growth around the world spurred
talk of deflation. [US/]
 Canada's two-year bond  was up 3 Canadian cents
to yield 1.358 percent, while the 10-year bond 
added 42 Canadian cents to yield 2.935 percent.
 However, Canadian bonds mostly lagged their U.S.
counterparts, with the difference between 10-year yields
widening 5.1 basis points to 35.6 basis points.
 ""I think Canada is being dragged along to a certain extent
for the ride,"" said Tulk.
 ""It seems (U.S. bonds) are still the safest place to hide.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
major currencies on Monday as early negative sentiment stemming
from weak Japanese growth data dissipated and traders decided
the currency's rally last week was too fast.
 U.S. stocks recovered from an early decline on global
economic worries sparked by the disappointing Japanese data.
That saw the greenback give up some of last week's gains when
risk aversion had pushed it up more than 3 percent against a
basket of currencies.
 Currency investors shrugged off U.S. manufacturing and
housing data that pointed to weakness in the economy, though
sentiment remained cautious overall with the safe-haven yen and
the Swiss franc posting broad gains.
 ""We saw risk aversion abating. Despite some weaker data out
of the U.S. including the NAHB (housing) index coming in weaker
than expected, the market preferred to ignore that,"" said
Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto.
 But he said the continued strength of the safe-haven yen,
with dollar/yen trading below 85.50, suggests the markets are
still wary of taking on risk and are looking for direction.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks the
greenback versus a basket of currencies, was last down 0.6
percent to 82.477. The index gained 3.13 percent last week, the
biggest weekly rise in nearly two years.
 ""The dollar strength at the end of last week was probably
somewhat overextended and the market is giving back some of
that,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief strategist at FX brokerage
OANDA in Toronto.
 The euro recovered against the dollar after falling almost
4 percent last week, its largest weekly drop since the week of
May 9. It was last at $1.2815, up 0.5 percent, recovering from
one-month lows hit in Asian trade.
 Analysts said the euro remains vulnerable to concerns about
the health of the continent's banking sector and sovereign debt
situation in peripheral economies.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish and
Greek government bonds rather than German Bunds widened, while
the cost of insuring their debt against default increased.
 Traders said the next downside target for euro/dollar is
$1.2600, the 50 percent retracement level of the euro's June to
August rally and a band of minor support is around 1.2730-40,
the lows from July and August.
 SWISS RALLY
 The dollar fell 1 percent to 85.32 yen with investors like
hedge funds still preferring to go short on the greenback.
 The Swiss franc rallied, with the U.S. dollar down 1.1
percent at 1.0395. The euro fell 0.6 percent to 1.3325 francs,
having earlier dropped to its lowest since July 8. Traders said
funds were lightening positions in euro/Swiss franc with sparse
liquidity exacerbating the fall.
 ""While EUR/USD remains largely around the 1.28 handle it is
EUR/CHF which continues to be the main avenue through which
concerns over euro zone peripherals is being felt in the FX
markets,"" Divyang Shah, strategist at IFR Markets, wrote to
clients. IFR is part of the Thomson Reuters group.
 The Swiss franc and the yen, both used to fund leveraged
carry trades, typically gain in times of market stress.
 The yen's gains came despite weaker-than-expected Japanese
gross domestic product numbers. Anemic growth and a rising
currency pose a headache for Japanese policy makers.
 Investors are wary of a possible meeting between Prime
Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
later this week to discuss the yen's strength.

(Adds analyst comments, retail map graphic, background, share

 By Michael Smith
 SYDNEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadian fertilizer maker Agrium
Inc  offered $1.1 billion for Australia's AWB ,
trumping a rival bid from local player GrainCorp , as
it seeks to expand its global retail operations.
 The battle for AWB, Australia's largest wheat exporter,
marks the latest round of consolidation in the country's grain
industry as offshore players scramble for a larger slice of the
action in the world's fourth-largest wheat exporting nation.
 Australia's wheat industry is counting on a bumper crop
this year, while suppliers in Europe and Russia struggle with
drought and poor production that have helped push wheat prices
to a two-year high this month.
 Industry sources said other big global competitors like
Canadian grain handler Viterra  and U.S. commodities
firm Gavil Group have also looked at AWB, which lost its
monopoly over Australia's bulk wheat exports two years ago.
 Still, the weekend's all-cash bid by Agrium, the largest
agricultural products retailer in North America, with a market
capitalization of $10.5 billion, came as surprise and sent AWB
shares soaring more than 30 percent on Monday.
 ""The acquisition should be accretive and is consistent with
Agrium's growth strategy,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Fai Lee
said in a note to clients.
 ""While we would have preferred to see a lower proposed
price or acquisition closer to North America, our initial
assessment of the announcement is positive,"" said Lee.
 Shares of Agrium opened lower on the Toronto Stock Exchange
on Monday and were down 1.3 percent at C$69.18 at midday. AWB
shares closed 29.7 percent higher at A$1.42, just below the
A$1.50 a share offer.
 Tom Elliot, managing director at MM&E Capital, noted that
although GrainCorp may come in with a counter-bid, its stock
price indicates that shareholders are not keen to enter into a
bidding war.
 GrainCorp shares jumped more than 6 percent to touch a
nine-month high, indicating that investors felt it was unlikely
that GrainCorp could come back with a higher offer. The shares
finished up 4.2 percent at A$6.53.
 Investors said Agrium's offer, a 37 percent premium to
AWB's Friday closing price, was expected to beat out
GrainCorp's lower all-share bid made last month.
 The latest offer values AWB at A$1.2 billion, according to
Reuters calculations, a premium to GrainCorp's all-share deal,
worth around A$921 million, based on both companies' share
prices at 0200 GMT.
 Sources close to the deal said AWB would consider both
offers but the Agrium offer looked like a ""no-brainer"".
 ""We would not be surprised if there were additional bids or
if other companies joined the fray. Specifically, in our view,
there is the potential for Viterra to enter the process, given
potential synergies,"" UBS analyst Brian MacArthur said in a
note to clients.
 Viterra acquired Australia's ABB Grain Ltd in a $1.4
billion deal last September, making it one of the world's
largest grain handlers. Viterra declined to comment on
speculation that it could launch a rival bid for AWB.
 Shares in other Australian agribusiness firms rose on
speculation of further mergers and acquisitions in the sector,
with shares in Elders Ltd  jumping around 12 percent.

For comparative StarMine table: http://r.reuters.com/waj25n
For a TAKA-A-LOOK on latest wheat stories: [ID:nLDE6721M9]

 Agrium wants to gain control of AWB's retail division
Landmark Rural Services, which it expects to grow using its
international fertilizer and crop protection sourcing
capabilities.
 Agrium's retail network in North America is roughly three
times larger than the second-largest player and its retail unit
alone boasted sales of more than $6 billion in 2009. It also
owns retail outlets in Argentina and has been expanding its
retail presence in Uruguay and Chile.
 Earlier this year, Agrium bowed out of a hostile bid for
U.S. rival CF Industries  after CF scuppered any hope of
a deal when it clinched an agreement to buy rival Terra
Industries. [ID:nN12157160]
 GLOBAL PARTNER
 AWB has long been seeking to partner with a global player
after losing its monopoly over Australia's bulk wheat exports
two years ago, when the government abolished the single-desk
system that the former Australia Wheat Board operated.
 Analysts say it needs to bulk up to compete with big global
competitors like Bunge Ltd , Cargill and Glencore, and
has been shrinking ever since it lost its exporting monopoly.
That followed a judicial inquiry that found the firm had paid
kickbacks to the former Iraq government of Saddam Hussein to
secure wheat sales.
 Agrium's offer remains conditional on due diligence,
foreign investment approvals and removal of a 10 percent
shareholder cap under AWB's constitution.
 AWB said it would continue to look at GrainCorp's bid,
alongside the new offer. Last month's offer from GrainCorp took
the market by surprise as AWB had been tipped to team up with
an overseas player.
 Under the earlier recommended GrainCorp offer, AWB
shareholders would get one GrainCorp share for every 5.75 AWB
shares, valuing each share at A$1.047.
 Deutsche Bank is advising AWB, and Barclays Capital is
advising Agrium. Flagstaff Partners is advising GrainCorp.

(Recasts, adds quote, detail)
 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro recovered against
the dollar on Monday after heavy selling last week, but
safe-haven currencies won out on overall growth concerns.
 The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year Irish and
Greek government bonds rather than German Bunds widened, while
the cost of insuring their debt against default also increased,
highlighting investors' concerns about peripheral euro zone
economies.
 Benchmark 10-year German yields  hit a record
low on worries about a faltering global economic recovery. The
Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, both used to fund leveraged
carry trades, are typically sought in times of market stress.
 But it was the euro's gains that were most dramatic after
the currency rebounded after falling almost 4 percent last
week, its largest weekly drop since the week of May 9.
 ""The euro bounced off of a three-week low against the
greenback as bargain-hunters helped underpin demand for the
single currency,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc in Washington. ""However,
given the market's much more selective mode of late, the euro
remains vulnerable to mounting concerns about the health of the
continent's banking sector and sovereign debt situation.""
 Midway through the New York session, the euro gained 0.7
percent to $1.2839 after climbing as high as $1.2871 ,
recovering from one-month lows hit in Asian trade. The early
sell-off in the euro marked the sixth straight day of lower
daily troughs for the single currency.
 ""The euro bounce ran out of steam around 1.2870, and given
the renewed pressures on the periphery, we think euro gains are
going to be limited near-term,"" said Win Thin, senior currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 Thin said levels to look out for on the downside are
1.2600, the 50 percent retracement level of the euro's June to
August rally and a band of minor support around 1.2730-40, the
lows from July and August.
 SWISS RALLY
 The dollar was down 1.1 percent at 1.0391 Swiss francs
after going to its lowest since Aug. 6 .
 The euro was 0.5 percent lower against the franc 
at 1.3334, having earlier dropped to its lowest since July 8.
Traders said funds were lightening positions in euro/Swiss
franc with sparse liquidity exacerbating the fall.
 ""Spreads in the peripherals are wider, financial stocks are
down and the Swiss franc is outperforming on safe-haven
demand,"" said Kenneth Broux, markets strategist at Lloyds
Banking Group. 
 The euro gave up early gains against the yen ,
falling 0.3 percent to 109.54 yen. Though off the session low,
it was not far from a one-month trough struck in Asian trade.
 The yen's gains came despite weaker-than-expected Japanese
gross domestic product numbers. Anaemic growth and a rising
currency pose a headache for Japanese policymakers.
 Investors are wary of a possible meeting between Prime
Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
later this week to discuss the currency's strength.
[ID:nTOE67B07V]
 Some traders said Japan's weaker second-quarter GDP data
could increase incentives for Japanese authorities to curb the
yen's strength.
 The dollar was down 1.1 percent at 85.35 yen  with
investors like hedge funds still preferring to go short on the
greenback.
 ""The yen will not be driven by Japanese data but whether
U.S. yields will head lower,"" said Gareth Berry, currency
strategist at UBS in Singapore. ""Things are pretty balanced
right now but there is a general caution about risk appetite.""
 The yen rose to its highest levels in 15 years versus the
dollar last week.
 In other currency pairs, sterling extended gains versus the
dollar, hitting the day's high as the UK currency tracked gains
in the euro and yen against the broadly weak U.S. currency. 
 The pound  hit the day's high of $1.5696 and was last
up 0.5 percent at $1.5666, with gains accelerating after
stop-loss orders were triggered around $1.5620 and $1.5640.
 The yuan's nominal effective exchange rate, or its
value against a trade-weighted basket of currencies,
depreciated 1.44 percent in July over June, according to the
latest data from the Bank for International Settlements. The
yuan's real effective exchange rate, adjusted for
inflation, slid 0.97 percent in the same period.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investors may look to pile into
the yen against the euro rather than the U.S. dollar, as worries
about intervention by Japanese authorities make them jittery
about stretching short positions in the greenback.
 The dollar's broad weakness against the yen will remain the
focus of any efforts by the Japanese to curb yen strength, even
as European officials appear coy towards supporting action.
 An unnamed European official said last week foreign exchange
intervention ""would not be welcomed in Europe"" and that joint
action to curb yen gains was not on the cards.
 The focus on the dollar's drop to 15-year lows below 85.00
yen -- seen as a key level -- means some market participants may
be missing the fact that the euro's falls lately have been even
steeper, sometimes driving broader moves in the currency market.
 ""At times it has been euro/yen flows that have been the key
driver,"" said Michael Derks, chief strategist at FXPro.
 ""People will be quite conscious that anything much below 85
in dollar/yen will be pretty critical for Japanese officials and
if traders want to express a positive yen view they are more
likely to do it through euro/yen than through dollar/yen"".
 Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan has expressed concern about
the yen's strength, and Monday's weak Japanese growth figures
will only add to those worries.
 Japanese authorities' previous intervention in the euro/yen
pair has been small, however, and only in conjunction with
intervention on dollar/yen. Of the 35 trillion yen spent by
Tokyo when it last intervened in FX markets over a 15-month
period ending in March 2004, just 173.2 billion was in euro/yen.
 
 FALLS TOWARDS 100 YEN?
 Dented by renewed concerns about problems on the periphery
of the euro zone and a spike in investor aversion, euro/yen shed
more than 3 percent last week. It continues to trade below 110
yen, leaving June's 8-1/2 year low of 107.32 in sight.
 ""It is not just the U.S. that Japan exports to. Europe is a
large part of their trade as well and the euro/yen story is not
far from being as important as the dollar/yen story,"" said
Audrey Childe-Freeman, currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman.
 ""Euro/yen is very difficult to assess because there is less
intervention history to go on, but in terms of psychological
levels, 100 yen has to be important.""
 A break below 107.32 would leave the 100 yen level in sight
-- potentially an extremely painful level for Japanese exporters
given the concurrent fall in dollar/yen. Before that, 105 yen is
likely to be a near-term target.
 Technically, the euro/yen cross appears to be under
pressure. Daily Ichimoku charts are flashing a sell signal, with
the euro having dropped below the cloud and into bearish
territory.
 Support is seen just above 105 yen and Japanese authorities
were reported to have intervened at that level in November 1999.
 Commerzbank technical analyst Axel Rudolph said once the
euro hit 8-1/2 year lows, it could find support between 106.84
-- the November 2003 low -- and the September 2001 low of
105.53.
 ""As long as we stay above 105.50 the BoJ might not
necessarily intervene straight away. But if that goes there is
not much to prevent a move down to 100"".
 Recent positioning data shows speculative investors sharply
increasing bets on the yen gaining. One-month euro/yen
risk-reversals -- a measure of the premium required to hold a
put or a call in a currency pair -- continue to show a bias for
more euro/yen downside.
 Implied euro/yen volatilities also suggest expectations of
future sharp moves have increased. One-month implied euro/yen
volatility jumped more than 10 percent on Wednesday, its biggest
one-day percentage gain since early June.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Safe-haven U.S. Treasury
prices rose on Monday while global stocks oscillated as weak
growth in Japan added to worries over a tepid global economic
recovery.
 Currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc rose and gold
touched its strongest in seven weeks, boosted by their
safe-haven appeal as weak economic growth around the world
spurred talk of deflation.
 ""Bond markets around the world are rallying, with yields
hitting new lows,"" said Peter Boockvar, an equity strategist at
Miller Tabak & Co in New York. He added that investors were
paring back their exposure to riskier assets after the data
dented confidence in the Asian recovery.
 ""With their (Japan's) exposure to Asia, people were hoping
for more strength,"" Boockvar said.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 25/32, with the yield at 2.5893 percent, hitting a 17-month
low.
 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was trading 2
points higher in price, with the yield at 3.7477 percent, down
from 3.86 percent at Friday's close and a 16-month low.
 The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 1/32, its
yield at 0.5043 percent.
 ""The phrase du jour is going to be deflation and it's not
only going to last for a day but for some time,"" said Christian
Cooper, senior rates trader at Jefferies & Co in New York.
 ""There's real concern that without further stimulation of
the economy, the overall weakness could lead not only to a
double dip but to outright price deflation ... it may be an
actual event as opposed to a concern.""
 Japan's gross domestic product grew a much
slower-than-expected 0.1 percent in April-June, translating to
an annualized increase of 0.4 percent as export growth
moderated and a stimulus-driven recovery in consumption ran out
of steam.
 That was far below 4.4 percent annualized growth in the
first three months of the year. [ID:nECONJP] [ID:nTOE67F001]
 U.S. stocks traded between negative and positive territory,
yet the Nasdaq later turned positive, buoyed by gains in
large-cap technology companies, including Cisco Systems Inc
.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 9.08
points, or 0.09 percent, at 10,294.07. The Standard & Poor's

1,078.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 8.43

 European stocks FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> lost 0.03

for four days in a row. The Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 0.38 percent.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> fell 0.6 percent, recovering from an
early drop of as much as 1.7 percent after gross domestic
product grew just 0.1 percent in the second quarter, compared
with forecasts of 0.6 percent.
 ""What has been driving sentiment for a little while now has
been this concern about the loss of momentum in the global
recovery,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of
research at Brewin Dolphin in London.
 ""The GDP figures out of Japan this morning clearly didn't
help. For the balance of the month, we are probably not going
to go anywhere. The earnings season was very good but it's
behind us now.""
 The fall in Treasury yields has been a big factor weighing
on the U.S. currency against the yen because of the recent high
correlation between dollar/yen and Treasury yields.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 1.03
percent at 85.30 from a previous session close of 86.190.
 The dollar fell 1.4 percent to 1.0355 francs after hitting
its lowest since August 6 . The euro was 0.5 percent
lower against the Swiss franc  at 1.3335, having
earlier dropped to its lowest since July 8.
 However, the euro  was up 0.72 percent at $1.2842
from a previous session close of $1.2750.
 In the commodity market, gold rose to its highest level
since early July, as the gloomy Japanese economic data stoked
investor concern about the pace of global economic recovery.
 Spot gold  rose 0.85 percent to $1,223.90 an ounce
after hitting an intraday day high of $1,227.15 -- its highest
since July 1. Bullion struck a record high around $1,264 in
June.
 Copper  advanced 1 percent, helped by lower
inventories and a weaker dollar, and crude oil prices 
edged 0.04 percent higher at $75.46 on a weaker dollar but was
held back by worries of a deceleration of the global economic
recovery.

(Adds trade figures, lawyer comment)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization
panel gave broad backing on Monday to the United States, Japan
and Taiwan in their complaint over controversial European
duties on electronics products, and told Brussels to bring its
trade measures into line with international rules.
 The panel said the EU had imposed the duties on flat-panel
displays, multifunction printers and television set-top boxes
in violation of the WTO's Information Technology Agreement.
 U.S. trade officials estimated worldwide trade in the three
products at $44 billion in 2009. The European Union's 27
nations imported $7 billion worth of the products that year.
 The European Commission criticized the 704-page ruling
before it was published, repeating its view that negotiations
on a comprehensive revision of the agreement were preferable to
litigation on only a few aspects of it.
 ""The report does not establish general principles that
would imply any form of generalised conclusions,"" it said in a
statement. ""Negotiations are the vehicle for mutually
beneficial liberalisation.""
 But it remains to be seen how seriously the EU's partners
will take the call for negotiations on a revised pact when they
believe Brussels is not even living up to the existing one.
 Japan's minister of economy, trade and industry, Masayuki
Naoshima, welcomed the ruling and called on the European Union
to remove the illegal tariffs immediately.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said the United States
had won an ""important victory.""
 U.S. and Asian electronics producers like Hewlett-Packard
Co, Motorola and Cisco unit Scientific Atlantic, are awaiting
any sign that the EU might appeal the WTO panel's findings.
 The parties have 60 days in which to appeal, but the
Commission said Brussels had not yet decided whether to do so.
 ""The EU has lost on everything, so if it appeals, it has
nothing to lose. I think they will appeal,"" said Philippe De
Baere, a partner at Van Bael & Bellis, which has represented
Taiwan and Japan in the case.
 SCREENS
 The Information Technology Agreement, which is voluntary,
abolished tariffs among 72 countries on products like computer
screens and printers to foster trade in high-tech goods.
 But the EU argued that added functionality since the
agreement was reached in 1996 meant that some products were now
consumer goods rather than information technology, and so were
not entitled to the zero tariffs under the deal.
 For instance, it said flat-panel computer displays could
also now serve as television screens.
 Brussels subsequently imposed duties ranging from 6 to 14
percent on the products.
 ""This ruling affirms the principle that changes in
technology are not an excuse to apply new duties to products
covered by the Information Technology Agreement,"" U.S. trade
chief Kirk said in a statement.
 Otherwise, countries would be allowed under the pact to tax
innovation, threatening continued technological development and
raising prices for millions of businesses and consumers, U.S.
trade officials said.
 The U.S. Information Technology Industry Council also
welcomed the ruling and said it was encouraging that Taiwan and
Japan had fully backed the United States.
 ""For us, it was a clear indication that the ITA, which is
extremely important for our industry, is alive and well, and
we're very pleased with the outcome,"" John Neuffer, council
vice-president for global policy, told Reuters.
 The three countries launched the case in June 2008. In
September of that year Brussels proposed updating the agreement
to take account of new technologies, a week before the three
plaintiffs secured the creation of a WTO panel to rule on the
dispute after consultations had failed to resolve it.
 Officials in Taiwan said last month the ruling would save
its exporters of flat-screens up to $611 million a year in
tariffs.
 Major flat-screen makers in Asia include South Korea's
Samsung Electronics and LG Display and Taiwan's AU Optronics.

 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The yen and the Swiss franc
led a broad rally in safe-haven currencies on Monday, while the
euro recovered as investors bet recent declines went too far,
too fast, even as investors remained sensitive to risk in euro

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United States recorded a
net capital outflow in June for the first time in five months,
the Treasury Department said on Monday, and China trimmed its
holdings of U.S. government bonds for a second straight month.
 Overseas investors unloaded a net $6.7 billion in U.S.
securities in June, including short-term instruments such as
Treasury bills. In May, they were buyers to the tune of $17.1
billion.
 Overseas appetite for long-term U.S. securities was
healthier in June. Foreigners bought a net $44.4 billion in
June compared with $35.3 billion in May.
 Most of that money went into Treasury notes and bonds,
which registered a net inflow of $33.2 billion, up about $18.3
billion from May. U.S. agency debt purchases fell by a $9.2
billion while overseas investors were net sellers of both U.S.
corporate debt and equities for a second straight month.
 The data ""indicates a general lack of interest in buying
anything but longer-term U.S. government bonds,"" said Michael
Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon."" All in
all, not the most supportive environment for the greenback.""
 Japan, the second-largest holder of Treasuries, increased
its holdings by $16.9 billion to $803.6 billion. But No. 1
Treasury holder China trimmed its holdings by $24 billion to
$843.7 billion, marking the second straight monthly reduction.
 A Chinese government economist said last week that Beijing
was buying record amounts of Japanese debt because it considers
it less risky than the U.S. variant. [ID:nTOE67A03B]
 ""This carries on our theme that China continues to sell
U.S. Treasuries and buy Japanese and European fixed income as
it diversifies its reserves,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing
director at Faros Trading in Stamford, Connecticut.

 As the biggest single buyer of Treasuries, China provides
an important source of financing for the U.S. current account
deficit. Its purchases also keep the value of its yuan currency
from appreciating too quickly against the dollar.
 Chinese authorities earlier this year signaled they would
allow more flexibility in the dollar-yuan exchange rate, which
could reduce Chinese demand for Treasuries.
 ""We expect this trend to continue now that China has a
'flexible' yuan and we read the data as U.S. dollar-negative
going forward,"" Borthwick said.

 JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Israel's economy grew at its
strongest pace in more than two years in the second quarter as
domestic demand and exports surged, official data showed on
Monday, easily exceeding analyst forecasts.
 Annualised quarterly growth rose 4.7 percent in the
April-June period, the Central Bureau of Statistics said in an
initial estimate. A Reuters survey of 8 analysts had forecast a
3.0 percent increase.
 The data may put more pressure on Bank of Israel Governor
Stanley Fischer to further tighten monetary policy, although he
has recently cautioned that growth may weaken in the second half
of the year due to slower exports.
 ""It shows that there is a bit of a disconnect with the
situation in Europe. Israel is in a stronger position than
Europe,"" Shlomo Maoz, chief economist at the Excellence Nessuah
brokerage, said of Monday's GDP figure.
 Aggregate GDP growth rate in the 16-country euro zone was
1.0 percent in the second quarter from the previous quarter. 
 Consumer spending in Israel jumped 8.7 percent in the
quarter, while exports, which make up 40-45 percent of economic
activity, grew 15.8 percent as sales continued to rebound from
the global financial crisis.
 The data come a day after the bureau reported annual
inflation fell to a rate of 1.8 percent in July, although the
Bank of Israel earlier on Monday reported that bond market
expectations for inflation over the next 12 months edged up to
3.0 percent last month.
 The central bank raised its benchmark lending rate on July
26 by a quarter-point to 1.75 percent, largely to combat rising
inflationary pressures stemming from surging housing prices. It
was the fifth increase in the past year.
 ""The (rates) trend is clearly upwards,"" said HSBC economist
Jonathan Katz, who expects two more quarter-point moves this
year. ""If you take into consideration that unemployment is also
coming down, the output gaps are shrinking and the fact that
there is a bubble in the housing market, all these factors will
contribute to further rate hikes this year."" 
 
 REVISIONS
 Excluding government spending, Israel's economy grew 6
percent in the second quarter.
 The statistics office also revised first quarter growth up
to 3.6 percent from a previous 3.4 percent, but cut
fourth-quarter 2009 GDP to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent.
 ""They are strong and surprising numbers. It's growth across
the board,"" said Gil Bufman, chief economist with Bank Leumi.
 ""But the numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt
because they tend to be revised quite substantially,"" he said,
specifically citing volatile export figures.
 Investment in fixed assets grew 10.9 percent, while imports
rose 8.3 percent. Public spending growth slowed to 1.4 percent,
the statistics bureau said.
 The quarterly growth figure was the strongest since the
first quarter of 2008, when the economy expanded 6.9 percent.
 For the first half of 2010, the economy grew 4.1 percent.
 Israel's economy expanded 0.7 percent in 2009 and the Bank
of Israel projects growth of 3.7 percent this year.
 Bufman said the 2010 estimates look to be on track. But he
doubted that government and central bank projections of 4
percent growth in 2011 could be met.
 ""The way things are looking in the world with a bit of a
slowdown, it will be pretty difficult to see a second year of
growth of 4 percent in 2011,"" he said.
 Key Tel Aviv share indexes were modestly higher, while the
shekel was slightly weaker versus the dollar. But bond prices
were up as much as 0.7 percent.

(Releads, adds quote, detail)
 By Anirban Nag
 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The yen and the Swiss franc led a
broad rally in safe-haven currencies on Monday, while the euro
pared gains against the dollar on heightened sensitivity to risk
in euro zone bond markets.
 The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year Irish and
Greek government bonds rather than German Bunds widened on
Monday, while the cost of insuring their debt against default
also increased, highlighting investors' concerns about
peripheral euro zone economies.
 Benchmark 10-year German yields earlier hit a record low on
worries about a faltering global economic recovery. The Swiss
franc and the Japanese yen, both used to fund leveraged carry
trades, are usually sought in times of market stress.
 ""Spreads in the peripherals are wider, financial stocks are
down and the Swiss franc is outperforming on safe-haven demand,""
said Kenneth Broux, Markets Strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 By 1128 GMT, the dollar was down more than 1 percent to
1.0400, having tested a one-week low of 1.0352 francs earlier in
the session. European banking stocks traded down around 0.8
percent.
 The euro was trading 0.6 percent lower against the Swiss
franc at 1.3325, having dropped to 1.3268 for the first time
since July 8. Traders said funds were lightening positions in
the euro/Swiss franc cross with sparse liquidity in currency
markets exacerbating the fall.
 The sell-off in the euro/Swiss franc cross saw the euro trim
gains against the U.S. dollar. It fell to $1.2810 from a session
high of $1.2836 and not far from one-month lows of $1.2734 hit
in Asian trade on trading platform EBS.
 That marked the sixth straight day of lower daily troughs
for the single currency.
 
 JAPAN STRUGGLING BUT YEN FLOURISHING
 The euro also gave up earlier gains against the yen, falling
0.3 percent to drop to 109.62 yen and not far from one-month
lows of 109.25 yen struck in Asian trade. 
 The yen's gains came despite weaker-than-expected Japanese
gross domestic product (GDP) numbers. Anaemic economic growth
and a rising currency are likely to pose a headache to Japanese
policymakers in coming days.
 Investors are wary of a possible meeting between Prime
Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
later this week to discuss the currency's strength and possible
responses.
 Some traders said Japan's weaker second-quarter GDP data
could increase incentives for Japanese authorities to curb the
yen's strength.
 The dollar was down 0.8 percent at 85.48 yen with investors
like hedge funds still preferring to go short on the greenback
and long on the yen as U.S. yields continued to tumble.
 Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed that speculators had extended net long positions in the
week to August 8 to 52,478 contracts from 47,998 a week earlier.
.
 ""The yen will not be driven by Japanese data but whether
U.S. yields will head lower,"" said Gareth Berry, currency
strategist at UBS in Singapore. ""Things are pretty balanced
right now but there is a general caution about risk appetite.""
 The yen rose to its highest levels in 15 years versus the
dollar last week, in a move driven by falling U.S yields.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to a fresh 16-month low
on Monday as weak economic numbers continued to raise concerns
about a double-dip recession in the world's largest economy.

(Recasts, adds comments by source)
 FRANKFURT, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Paternoster, part-owned by
Deutsche Bank, appointed insurance brokers Willis to raise more
capital, a person familiar with the matter said, in a move that
could lead to a sale of the specialist pension business.
 Paternoster declined to comment. Deutsche Bank, which owns
40 percent of Paternoster, declined to comment on whether it
would put more funds into the company.
 Rival insurance business Pension Corporation, which made an
unsuccessful attempt to buy Paternoster in May, is not planning
to renew its bid, another source familiar with the matter said
on Monday.
 London-based Paternoster, which had assets of 3.3 billion
euros ($4.23 billion) at the end of 2009, specialises in taking
on the risks associated with companies' pension schemes and
assumes responsibility for paying their pensioners in the
future.
 But the business has been restructuring in the wake of the
Sept. 2008 collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers and
is on the lookout for fresh capital.
 The Financial Times earlier cited people close to the matter
as saying Willis is advising Paternoster on its options and has
sent out information to banks, insurers, reinsurers and
financial investors to solicit offers for all or part of the
company.
 Paternoster is hoping to receive initial expressions of
interest by September, the newspaper said.
 The company's other shareholders include Eton Park, which
owns a 25 percent stake, Cheyne Capital, Lansdowne Partners, and
Jupiter Asset Management. 
 Earlier this year, Paternoster helped Deutsche Bank execute
the largest ever longevity insurance transaction when it helped
BMW hedge its longevity risk for its UK operations pension
scheme.
 Through Deutsche Bank's wholly-owned insurance company,
Abbey Life, BMW hedged risks associated with almost 3 billion
pounds ($4.68 billion) of pension scheme liabilities related to
about 60,000 pensioners.

(Adds details, quotes)
 By Khalid al-Ansary
 BAGHDAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Iraq has enough wheat reserves
to last the year thanks to good rains and a bigger harvest and
does not expect to be affected by rising prices following a
drought in Russia, the head of the Iraqi Grain Board said.
 Iraq's farmers sold 1.866 million tonnes of wheat to the
agency in 2009/2010, up from 1.25 million tonnes the previous
season, Hassan Ibrahim, director general of the Grain Board,
told Reuters in a recent interview.
 He said he did not expect Iraq, one of the world's biggest
importers of rice and wheat, to be affected as a buyer by a
severe drought in the Black Sea region, which has led Moscow to
ban wheat exports.
""The amount of wheat sold to us by farmers in Kurdistan's
Arbil, Dahuk and from Mosul was high. We received big
quantities,"" Ibrahim said.
 Farmers also harvested more than 450,000 tonnes of barley
this season, he said.
 ""We, as a grain company, have a good reserve that is enough
for us until the end of the year,"" he said.
 Iraq, once a regional breadbasket, is trying to revive its
agriculture sector after years of war, economic sanctions and
drought. The agriculture sector suffers from high soil salinity,
poor irrigation practices and a lack of proper seeds and
fertilizer.
 All but a tiny fraction of the national harvest is sold to
the Grain Board, which administers a massive public food ration
programme.
 Ibrahim said there would also be enough rice reserves to
last until the end of 2010 after one final tender, which would
be awarded soon.
 Nine international firms from the United States, Thailand,
Vietnam and Switzerland bid for the tender.
 Iraq's population of around 30 million consumes at least 1
million tonnes of rice annually and 4.5 million tonnes of wheat.

 GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The number of passengers buying
premium airline tickets jumped again in June, as economic
recovery kept first and business seats filled, the airline
industry association IATA said on Monday.
 But there are signs that growth slowed in the second quarter
as economic activity returned to pre-crisis levels, the
International Air Transport Association said in its monthly
premium monitor.
 Demand for premium tickets in June was 16.6 percent higher
than a year ago, against a 9.5 percent rise for economy, where
recession and austerity measures in some countries is dampening
leisure travel.
 Growth for the first half of the year was 11.9 percent for
premium and 6.3 percent for economy.
 But annualised growth in the second quarter, adjusted for
the disruption from the Icelandic ash cloud, slowed to 9 percent
for premium from double-digit figures in the first quarter, it
said.
 ""This sort of slowdown should be expected as the
post-recession rebound and business inventory cycle boosts
disappear,"" it said.
 Revenue on premium seats was just over 40 percent higher in
June than a year ago, reflecting both the increased number of
passengers and a strong rise in average fares.
 Demand for seats showed wide regional variation, with Asian,
South American and Middle Eastern markets strong, but
Transatlantic routes sluggish.
 IATA, whose 230 members include AMR Corp's American
Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Lufthansa, expects
airlines to return to the black this year, with profits of $2.5
billion against earlier forecasts of a $2.8 billion loss.

 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near one-month
lows against the dollar and fell sharply versus a broadly firmer
Swiss franc on Monday, amid heightened sensitivity to risk in
euro zone bond markets.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish and Greek
government bonds rather than German Bunds rose on Monday, while
the cost of insuring their debt against default also increased.
 Benchmark 10-year German yields earlier hit a record low of
2.362 percent on worries about a faltering global economic
recovery.
 ""Spreads in the peripherals are wider, financial stocks are

said Kenneth Broux, Markets Strategist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 At 0929 GMT, the euro was trading down around 0.6 percent
versus the Swiss franc at 1.3328 francs after briefly falling
below 1.3300 for the first time since July 8. Traders said
sparse liquidity in currency markets was exacerbating the fall.
 The Swiss franc was also in demand versus the U.S. dollar,
which fell over 1 percent to a one-week low at 1.0398 francs.
European banking stocks traded down around 0.6 percent.
 The euro was up around 0.5 percent versus a broadly weaker
dollar at $1.2810, helped by demand from a major Swiss bank.
 But it remained near one-month lows of $1.2734 hit in
overnight trade on trading platform EBS. That marked the sixth
straight day of lower daily troughs for the single currency.
 Last week, the euro fell as yield spreads between government
bonds issued by peripheral euro zone countries and German Bunds
widened due to concerns over the costs of supporting the Irish
banking sector and disappointing Greek economic data.
 Positive effects from strong German and euro zone growth
figures were limited.
 ""The problem for the euro is that growth is rather
concentrated in Germany, with the periphery still struggling,""
said analysts at Credit Agricole CIB in a note to clients.
 Technical analysts noted next support around $1.2725, a
trendline taken from this year's low in the $1.1880 area.
 
 JAPAN STRUGGLING
 The euro traded down around 0.1 percent on the day versus
the yen at 109.80 yen. Data showing that Japan's economic growth
slowed markedly in April-June pulled euro/yen to one-month lows
of 109.25 yen on trading platform EBS in Asia.
 The yen's gains were tempered by caution ahead of a possible
meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa later this week to discuss the
currency's strength and possible responses.
 The yen rose to highest levels in 15 years versus the dollar
last week, in a move driven by falling US yields.
 A fall in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to a fresh
16-month low on Monday was one factor weighing on the dollar
against the yen, which traded down around 0.5 percent at 85.70
yen.
 Government sources have said it and the BOJ are coordinating
to set up a meeting between Kan and Shirakawa that is likely to
be in the second half of this week, and that has stirred market
speculation that Japanese authorities may soon unveil some type
of response on the yen.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro recovered from near
one-month lows against the dollar on Monday, aided by a bounce
in equity markets, but rallies were hampered by sovereign sales
and concerns about the euro zone periphery.
 The single currency initially headed lower for a sixth
straight day before a slight recovery in European dealing.

(Adds new contract in Australia)
 By Maria Sheahan 
 FRANKFURT, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Hochtief, Germany's biggest
construction company, raised its 2010 outlook for new orders
after receiving several large contracts in Australia and Asia in
the second quarter.
 ""Alongside strong growth in contract mining in the
Asia-Pacific region, the company is benefiting from sustained
strong demand for construction services on infrastructure
projects in Australia,"" Hochtief said on Monday.
 While Australian unit Leighton bucked a recent trend towards
weaker domestic construction activity by pulling in more
contracts, Hochtief's European orders shrank by more than
two-thirds in the second quarter, with the outlook remaining
weak despite strong economic growth.
 Hochtief now expects 2010 new orders will exceed the 2009
level of 22.5 billion euros ($28.7 billion), rather than
slightly declining. It still sees pretax profit dropping
slightly after coming in just above estimates in the quarter.
 Infrastructure companies have been bolstered by lavish
stimulus spending during the global economic crisis but were
expected to feel the brunt of public works cuts as governments
try to keep public finances under control.
 Australia's construction activity, for example, contracted
in June and July as public building was hit by the withdrawal of
stimulus spending after expanding for three straight months from
March through May.
 Hochtief seemed immune to the recent weakness. It announced
on Monday it won a 577 million euro contract to build a section
of the Hunter Expressway in New South Wales, Australia, which is
due to be opened for traffic at the end of 2013.
 The group's quarterly new orders were almost double the
volume that had been expected in a Reuters poll, with close to
three-quarters of orders coming from the Asia Pacific region,
raising hopes for robust sales in the years ahead.
 Quarterly new orders at the Australian unit included a major
contract to work on a section of Melbourne's ring road, a
project to upgrade the electrical distribution network of
western Australia's Perth and a contract to provide coal mining
services in Indonesia.
 Leighton also accounted for about 84 percent of Hochtief's
quarterly pretax profit, helping offset weaker growth in Europe
and North America.
 
 EUROPEAN WEAKNESS
 Shares in Hochtief jumped 5.65 percent to 52.43 euros by
1027 GMT, while the STOXX Europe 600 Construction & Materials
index was up 0.3 percent. 
 Leighton's shares rallied on Monday after the company
reported a 39 percent rise in full-year profit, helped by mining
services and infrastructure projects.
 Hochtief's biggest German rival Bilfinger Berger, which
postponed plans to take its Australian unit public, raised its
outlook last week as it continued to cut its exposure to the
construction sector.
 Europe's construction sector is expected to contract for a
third consecutive year in 2010, and Germany, whose economy
bolstered the region's growth in the second quarter, will be no
exception.
 ""Construction demand in Germany is not expected to show a
sustained recovery in the medium term,"" Hochtief said, adding it
would focus on cutting costs to remain profitable there.
 France's Vinci, the world's largest construction group, saw
an acquisition offset a drop in European construction projects.

 Investors are looking to other European players reporting
earnings this week to give an indication whether the
infrastructure industry is heading for a cliff as stimulus
programmes run out.
 Austria's Wienerberger, the world's biggest brick maker,
cement makers Cimpor and Holcim as well as Dutch Boskalis will
publish results this week.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Monday as
high-yielding currencies and Asian equities faltered, with talk
of possible demand from Japanese exporters and investor fund
repatriation also giving the yen a boost.
 Data showing that Japan's economic growth slowed markedly in
April-June helped drag Tokyo shares lower. The dip in equities
gave support to the yen, which is a funding currency for carry
trades and tends to rise in times of market stress.
 A fall in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to a fresh 16-month
low on Monday was one factor weighing on the dollar against the
yen, due to the high recent correlation between dollar/yen and
Treasury yields.
 The yen was also bolstered by talk of yen-buying by Japanese
exporters and market speculation about possible fund repatriation
by Japanese investors related to coupon payments on U.S.
Treasuries due around now.
 ""I think the basic direction is toward dollar weakness and
yen strength,"" said a trader for a major Japanese bank.
 But the yen's gains were tempered by caution ahead of a
possible meeting between Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of
Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa later this week to discuss the
currency's strength and possible responses.
 The dollar dipped 0.4 percent against the yen to 85.83 yen,
slipping back in the direction of a 15-year low of 84.72 yen
struck on trading platform EBS last week.
 Traders said there was a decent amount of bids in dollar/yen
on the downside, all the way down to around 84.50 yen, and such
bids were likely to support the dollar.
 The New Zealand dollar fell 0.7 percent against the yen to

by peripheral euro zone countries and German bonds widened due to

 JAPANESE AUTHORITIES
 Some traders said Japan's weaker Q2 GDP data could increase
incentives for Japanese authorities to take measures to curb
export-sapping yen strength.
 Government sources have said it and the BOJ are coordinating
to set up a meeting between Kan and Shirakawa that is likely to
be in the second half of this week, and that has stirred market
speculation that Japanese authorities may soon unveil some type
of response on the yen.
 Economics Minister Satoshi Arai said on Monday the government
was in discussions with the BOJ on the yen's rise. Arai added,
however, that he was unaware if Kan would meet Shirakawa soon.
 Market players say the most likely possibility is the
adoption of some form of additional monetary easing or liquidity
provision steps such as expanding the amount or duration of the
BOJ's fixed-rate fund supply operation, and yen-selling
intervention seems unlikely at this stage.
 Analysts at RBC Capital Markets see a relatively small risk
of outright intervention by the Japanese authorities.
 The yen is not particularly high in real terms, given that
Japan has been in deflation for several years, they said.
 ""Also, the declining share of the U.S. in Japan's trade and
the rise of China diminishes the importance of the dollar to the
Japanese authorities, so long as China delivers the yuan
flexibility it promises,"" RBC said in a note to clients.
 If Japan were to intervene, market players say the general
feeling is that the rest of the Group of Seven nations would not
support intervention, leaving Japan to go it alone.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly on Monday as
high-yielding currencies and Asian equities faltered, with talk
of possible demand from Japanese exporters and investor fund
repatriation lending the yen additional support.
 Data showing that Japan's economic growth slowed markedly in
April-June helped drag Tokyo shares lower and supported the
low-yielding yen. The yen is a funding currency for carry trades
and tends to rise in times of market stress.
 A dip in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to a fresh 16-month
low in Asian trading on Monday helped weigh on the dollar against
the yen.
 The yen was also supported by talk of yen-buying by Japanese
exporters and market speculation about possible fund repatriation
by Japanese investors related to coupon payments on U.S.
Treasuries due around this time of August.
 But the Japanese currency's gains were tempered by caution
ahead of a possible meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Naoto
Kan and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa later this week
to discuss the yen's strength and possible responses.
 ""I think the basic direction is toward dollar weakness and
yen strength,"" said a trader for a major Japanese bank.
 One caveat is that there do not seem to be many players that
are strongly committed to selling the greenback against the yen
right now, judging from how the dollar managed to trim its losses
after the BOJ checked the dollar/yen rate last week.
 The dollar dipped 0.4 percent against the yen to 85.84 yen,
slipping back in the direction of a 15-year low of 84.72 yen
struck on trading platform EBS last week.
 But traders said there were a decent amount of bids in
dollar/yen on the downside, all the way down to around 84.50 yen,
adding that such bids were likely to support the dollar.
 The New Zealand dollar fell 0.8 percent against the yen to
60.35 yen and the Australian dollar slipped 0.7 percent to 76.41
yen, while MSCI's broad measure of Asian shares outside Japan
shed 0.8 percent.
 The euro dipped 0.2 percent against the yen to 109.68 yen,
having earlier dropped to as low as 109.25 yen.
 Daily Ichimoku charts are now flashing a sell signal for the
euro against the yen, with the euro having dropped below the

 The euro edged up 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.2781,

761,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2010 08:04PM ET</span>","Japan Q2 GDP up 0.1 pct q/q, well below forecast"," TOKYO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew 0.1 percent in
April-June, slowing sharply from the previous two quarters as
export growth moderated and a stimulus-driven recovery in
consumption ran out of steam.
 The expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) translates into
an annualised increase of 0.4 percent, the Cabinet Office said,
well below a median market forecast of 2.3 percent, after revised
4.4 percent growth in the first three months of the year.
 Growth in the world's second biggest economy was far short of
a 2.4 percent gain in the United States in the same quarter,
although it managed to eke out a third straight quarter of
expansion.
 Japan's growth was led by solid shipments particularly to
Asia, although the pace of export gains moderated somewhat.
External demand contributed 0.3 percentage point to GDP growth,
after 0.6 percentage point in the first quarter.
 Private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of the
economy, was flat, partly relfecting a reaction to a rush of
demand for flat-screen TVs in the first quarter ahead of changes
to a government incentive scheme in April.
 Economists polled by Reuters expect economic growth to remain
slow in coming quarters, with some predicting a double-dip

 * Other key interest rates unchanged

(Adds analyst comment, background)
 By Martin Dokoupil and Regan E.Doherty
 DOHA/DUBAI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Qatar cut its overnight
deposit rate by 50 basis points, the first reduction in over two
years, to bring it more into line with global and regional
rates, the central bank said on Sunday.
 The cut to 1.5 percent is effective Aug. 11, the bank's
website www.qcb.gov.qa showed.
 The bank confirmed reports of a rate cut by banking sources
last week. Gulf officials rarely discuss policy in public and
some decisions are not immediately announced.
 ""Lowering the interest rate in Qatar was in line with the
global and regional situation,"" the bank said.
 Continued deflation in recent months and July's rating
upgrade by Standard & Poor's by one notch to 'AA' were also
reasons for the cut, it added.
 Other key rates -- the overnight lending facility and the
repo rate -- were unchanged at 5.5 percent and 5.55 percent,
respectively.
 Analysts have said the rate move was aimed at boosting
Qatar's non-oil economy and curbing capital inflows.
 Qatar, the world's largest liquefied natural gas exporter,
had kept its main rates unchanged since May 2008 despite the
global financial crisis.
 Its economy is expected to surge 16.1 percent in real terms
this year, faster than any other Gulf oil exporter, mainly due
to gas output expansion and generous infrastructure spending.
 Inflation is expected to be in the low single digits with
consumer prices forecast to rise 1.7 percent this year after
falling 4.9 percent in 2009.
 Consumer prices edged up by 0.1 percent month-on-month in
June for an annual decline of 2.8 percent.
 Government-driven expansion of gas facilities, however, is
coming to an end and there is a need to support the non-oil
sector, analysts have said.
 
 CAPITAL INFLOWS
 The International Monetary Fund, in a report on Qatar in
February, said the central bank had indicated it was monitoring
capital inflows carefully and was ready to adjust interest rates
if needed.
 ""They did it for the same reasons you're hearing from others
- that the increase in liquidity in the banking system is
creating an influx, and putting pressure on the central bank,""
said Kapil Chadda, head of investment banking at HSBC in Qatar.
 ""It's a pretty neutral move. I don't think it will have much
of an impact,"" he said.
 Qatar pegs its currency to the dollar, limiting central
banks' flexibility to move too far from the U.S. benchmark rate
as that could trigger larger capital flows and put their pegs
under pressure.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent through mid-2011.
 Qatar's Deputy central bank governor Sheikh Fahad Faisal
al-Thani told Reuters last December that by holding rates
steady, the bank wanted to maintain a positive differential with
the U.S. benchmark to prevent capital outflows.
 Private sector deposits in Qatari banks climbed to 177.1
billion riyals ($48.68 billion) in May, their highest level
since at least 2005, as the global economy has improved and
commercial banks' deposit rates stayed relatively high.

 By Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - India's prime minister on
Sunday defended his decision to raise fuel prices as a measure
of fiscal prudence, saying his government was making every
effort to tackle double-digit inflation that is hurting the
poor.
 Headline inflation in India may touch 10.39 percent in
July, its sixth straight month in double digits, turning into
the single biggest challenge for the government and prompting
the central bank to raise rates four times already this year.
 A year-long spell of double-digit food inflation has also
sparked street protests, giving the opposition a handle against
the government ahead of major state elections in early 2011,
including in eastern West Bengal and southern Tamil Nadu
states.
 ""It is our responsibility that we manage our economy with
prudence so that our development is not affected adversely in
the future because of high debt,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
said in a speech from the ramparts of a Mughal-era fort to mark
India's 63rd Independence Day.
 ""The subsidy on petroleum products has been increasing
every year. It had become necessary therefore to increase the
prices of petroleum products. If this had not been done, it
would not have been possible for our budget to bear the burden
of subsidy.""
 In June, the government moved to free up gasoline pricing
and raised prices of other fuel in a bid to keep the fiscal
deficit within the targetted 5.5 percent of GDP in 2010/11.
 Singh, leading the Congress party coalition for a second
term after last year's strong election victory, also called for
raising the annual farm growth rate to 4 percent, and said his
government had given incentives to farmers to encourage
production.
 ""But one effect of providing higher prices to farmers is
that food prices in the open market also increase,"" he said.
 Security was tight across the country, with fears of
militant attacks and tensions high in Kashmir, where a renewed
separatist uprising has killed over 50 people in past two
months. India's Maoist rebels have also stepped up attacks in
the countryside.
 Kashmiri marked the day with a separatist shutdown.
Thousands of people held an anti-India protest, dodging heavily
armed police who used metal barricades and barbed wire to seal
off residential areas and enforce a curfew, which has been
imposed off-and-on across the region for almost two months.
 In Srinagar, Kashmir summer capital, a policeman hurled a
shoe at Omar Abdullah, the region's pro-India chief minister,
while he took part in an official Independence Day parade. The
shoe missed him and the thrower was bundled off by police.
 At least 57 people have been killed in two months of
anti-India protests in Kashmir where a separatist revolt
against India broke out in 1989. The latest round of protests
was triggered by the killing of a teenager by police in June.
 Singh renewed his call to the Maoists and Kashmiri rebels
to abjure violence and come for talks with the government.
 He also urged dialogue to resolve differences with old
rival Pakistan.
 The two sides are trying to improve ties that plummeted
after the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. India
blamed the attacks on Pakistan-based militants.
 ""We expect from them that they would not let their
territory be used for acts of terrorism against India,"" Singh
said.
 ""If this is not done, we cannot progress far in our
dialogue with Pakistan.""

separatist uprising has killed over 50 people in past two
months. India's Maoist rebels have also stepped up attacks in
the countryside.
 Singh renewed his call to the Maoists and Kashmiri rebels
to abjure violence and come for talks with the government.
 ""Discussion and dialogue are the only options to resolve
complex issues,"" he said, calling for rapid development in the
country's remote regions to wean people away from the Maoists.
 Singh also urged dialogue to resolve differences with old
rival Pakistan.
 The two sides are trying to improve ties that plummeted
after the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people and
derailed their sluggish four-year-old peace process. India
blamed the attacks on Pakistan-based militants.
 ""We expect from them that they would not let their
territory be used for acts of terrorism against India,"" Singh
said.
 ""If this is not done, we cannot progress far in our
dialogue with Pakistan.""

 * Current grain export ban runs from Aug. 15 to Dec. 31
 * Russia could export 2.8 million tonnes from July 1-Aug. 15
 * Fewer fires blazing on Saturday -- Emergencies Ministry

(adds details on fires, blaze near nuclear centre controlled)
 MOSCOW, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Russia plans to discuss after
Oct. 1 whether to extend a grain export ban into next year,
First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov told Reuters, after a
severe drought ruined vast tracts of the country's grain crop.
 The ban comes into force on Sunday and is due to last until
Dec. 31, a move designed to restrain domestic food prices
because of the worst drought in more than a century -- which has
also caused forest fires and left Moscow blanketed in smoke.
 ""After October 1 we can discuss how to act after December of
this year,"" Zubkov said in an email sent on Saturday.
 Zubkov's statement follows contrasting remarks by Russia's
leadership on the ban.
 President Dmitry Medvedev has said the ban could be lifted
earlier if the harvest permits. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
has said it could last into 2011, after announcing the grain
crop could be as low as 60 million tonnes.
 Russia harvested 97 million tonnes of grain in 2009, and it
needs 78 million tonnes to cover domestic consumption.
 In the emailed statement, Zubkov stressed that the
government had to balance the interests of grain traders with
the need to maintain stability on the domestic food market.
 ""We understand the anxiety of our exporters,"" he said.
 ""Therefore, as I have said, the ban is a temporary measure.
Furthermore, we are continually monitoring and analysing grain,
feed and seed supplies on the domestic market.""
 Agriculture Ministry data shows that Russia may have no more
grain to ship abroad from this year's crop, even if it lifts
export bans from 2011.
 The Agriculture Ministry has said Russia could export about
2.8 million tonnes of grain between July 1 and Aug. 15. It
exported 22 million tonnes of grain in 2009/10.
 The number of fires burning across Russia on Saturday
dropped to 480 from 505 on Friday, the Emergencies Ministry
said, and the air in the capital was noticeably cleaner. 
 ""The situation regarding the wildfires has improved markedly
at present,"" Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu said a statement
late on Friday.
 A fire near a nuclear research centre in Sarov, about 350 km
(220 miles) east of Moscow, has also been brought under control,
the head of Russia's nuclear agency told a television station.
 The fires have killed more than 50 people.
 Several nations, including Armenia, Bulgaria and the United
States have sent firefighters and equipment to help.

 * Chilean peso surges 1 pct in week on rate hike

 By Michael O'Boyle
 MEXICO CITY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso and Brazil's
real edged up on Friday after being battered through the week
by concerns about slowing growth in the United States even as
losses were contained by flows into the region's bonds.
 Chile's peso brushed off global concerns to surge about 1
percent this week as the central back hiked interest rates for
the third month in a row. But Colombia's peso sank more than 1
percent since the previous Friday amid the threat of government
intervention in the exchange market.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve expressed deeper concerns about
U.S. growth this week that rattled stock and currency markets.
Some investors are betting the U.S. economy could slip back
into recession after recovering from a deep slump last year.
 ""There is real uncertainty about the economic activity in
the United States, and this will keep affecting the foreign
exchange market,"" said Salvador Orozco, a currency and debt
strategist at Santander in Mexico City.
 But investors sitting on cash were drawn to Latin American
bonds. Local debt offers higher yields than the meager returns
on government bonds in major developed markets, where
policymakers have pledged to keep interest rates low to support
growth.
 More prudent fiscal management in Latin America during the
past decade has put the shine on local debt amid Europe's debt
troubles.
 Mexico's benchmark 10-year peso bond  shed 25
basis points this week to bid at a record low of 6.29 percent
on Friday.
 ""We never thought we would see such low yields, but it is a
function of the foreigners' liquidity,"" Orozco said.
 The Mexican peso  edged up 0.07 to 12.7225 per dollar
on Friday after data showed rising, but still tepid, U.S.
August consumer confidence and July retail sales. The peso shed
0.31 percent for the week.
 Brazil's real  bid 0.11 percent stronger at 1.770 per
dollar in the local spot market. In international trade, the
real  shed about 0.7 percent for the week.
 JAWBONING GAINS
 Colombia's peso sank for a second straight session due to
concerns local authorities will intervene in the foreign
exchange markets to cool sharp currency gains that are hurting
local exporters.
 Colombia's peso  shed 0.47 percent to 1,834.90
per dollar, racking up a 1.1 percent loss for the week.
 Before sharp losses in the last two sessions, the Colombian
currency had gained about 12 percent since early May, boosted
by investment flows into the country's oil and mining
industries, which also drew speculative traders.
 Analysts think Colombia could reinstate daily dollar
purchases that expired in June, but that would do little more
than slow the pace of gains.
 Chile's peso closed at a five-month high on Friday, a day
after the country's central bank raised its benchmark interest
rate to 2 percent, in line with expectations, as the economy
bounces back from a devastating earthquake. For more, see
[ID:nN12145806]
 Chile's peso's  edged up 0.02 percent to 509.40 per
dollar, posting a 1 percent gain for the week.
 The country's currency has firmed about 7 percent since
the end of June. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera hinted
Thursday the government could cash in less dollar revenue from
copper sales to offset the flows into Chilean assets.
[ID:nN12124343]
 But analysts looked for the currency to firm further on
expectations of more interest rate hikes by the central bank,
which is seen taking its benchmark rate to 3.75 percent by
year-end. [ID:nN12129420]

 * Agreement follows lengthy legal battle
 * Rambus shares up 6.8 pct; Nvidia up 4.8 pct
(adds analysis and updated stock quotes)
 NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Chip designer Rambus Inc
 granted patent licenses to graphics chip maker Nvidia
Corp , the companies said on Friday, raising hopes of
an end to a lengthy legal battle and boosting their shares.
 Rambus granted Nvidia a patent license at a 1 percent
royalty rate for SDR memory controllers, technology that relays
signals between the device and its memory. Nvidia makes
graphics chips that use SDRAM. Rambus will also charge Nvidia a
2 percent royalty rate for other memory controllers,
 The agreement comes after the International Trade
Commission ruled last month that Nvidia and others had
infringed Rambus' chip patents.
 Nvidia and Rambus also said they had not signed any
releases of liability, nor dismissed any litigation between
them, leaving open the possibility that the two companies may
still slug it out in court.
 A Rambus representative declined to comment, and a Nvidia
spokesperson could not be reached.
 The agreement could affect the calculation of damages in
that legal fight, said James Hopenfeld, an intellectual
property partner at Ropes & Gray who is not involved in the
case.
 The deal could also be a way for Rambus to send a signal to
its other litigation foes, Hopenfeld said.
 ""From Rambus's perspective, it's probably terms they
wouldn't complain about if they were used to gauge royalty
rates for other people,"" Hopenfeld said.
 The deal with Nvidia could generate approximately $10
million in quarterly revenue for Rambus, BWS Financial Inc.
analyst Hamed Khorsand said.
 ""What it could impact is getting other companies to renew
and take new licenses for Rambus,"" Khorsand said.
 Rambus licenses patents for use in other companies'
products, such as the Sony Corp's <6758.T> Playstation 3.
 South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS>
settled its long-running legal battle with Rambus in January,
agreeing to a licensing and investment pact that could be worth
$900 million over half a decade to the memory chip designer.
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
October will rehear arguments in a dispute between Rambus and
Hynix Semiconductor <000660.KS> and Micron Technology Inc
.
 Rambus shares climbed 4.2 percent to $18.77 in late
afternoon trade, while Nvidia was up 5 percent at $9.41.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell a fourth
straight day on Friday, dropping 6.6 percent for the week, on
mounting concerns about slowing economic growth that have
weighed on equities and oil prices.
 Friday's mixed data did not alleviate the concerns or
provide much market cheer.
 U.S. retail sales rebounded in July but the gains were
concentrated in autos and gasoline station sales and showed
hints of lingering economic softness. [ID:nN13180040]
 Consumer sentiment showed improvement in August, but as
with the retail sales data, there were still signs people
remain nervous about the near term.
 Oil prices had already been pummeled earlier in the week by
a jobless claims rise highlighting a fragile U.S. employment
sector after last week's disappointing July nonfarm payrolls
report, and by rising refined fuel stockpiles punctuating tepid
oil demand.
 U.S. crude for September  delivery fell 35 cents to
settle at $75.39 a barrel, trading from $75.01 to $76.74.
 For the week, U.S. crude lost $5.31, or 6.6 percent, the
biggest weekly percentage loss since the week to July 2, when
prices ended down $6.72, or 8.52 percent, with the market
pressured by a weak June nonfarm payrolls on that Friday.
 U.S. September RBOB gasoline futures  fell 1.52 cents
to settle at $1.9396 a gallon on Friday. That was down 17.31
cents, or 8.19 percent in the week, also the biggest weekly
percentage loss since the week to July 2.
 U.S. heating oil futures  fell 0.59 cent to settle at
$1.9956 a gallon, down 15.16 cents, or 7 percent, and also the
biggest weekly percentage loss since the week to July 2.
 Front-month ICE Brent crude  also fell a fourth
straight day on Friday, dropping 41 cents to settle at $75.11 a
barrel.

 ""The whole week has been about poor economic data and
today's releases show that the U.S. consumer is still on the
mend,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, commodity strategist at BNP
Paribas.
 ""Retail sales disappointed and if consumer confidence in
August managed to come in a notch above expectations ... it
still remains below the June reading.""
 The U.S. dollar rose and headed for its strongest weekly
performance against major currencies in almost two years as a
lackluster Italian debt sale and tepid U.S. consumer data fed
slower growth fears. The euro fell to a three-week low against
the dollar.
 Earlier on Friday, strong euro zone economic data pushed
oil prices up $1, before the rally by European stocks and the
euro gave way. Euro zone gross domestic product grew at its
fastest pace in more than three years in the second quarter,
boosted by strong performances in Germany and France.
[ID:nLDE67C0YX]
 OPEC DEMAND VIEW LITTLE CHANGED
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said
in a monthly report that oil demand growth would continue be
slow in 2011, when world economic expansion is projected to be
slightly lower than in 2010, leaving the current supply
overhang intact. [OPEC/M]
 And with U.S. crude oil inventories remaining at a premium
to year-ago levels, OPEC members' production has been creeping
higher. Members with output quotas -- all except Iraq --
produced 26.861 million barrels per day in July, 142,600 bpd
more than in June.

 * Euro/dollar close below 1.2777 may bring further drop
 * More gains seen for yen; traders shun intervention talks
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - This week's sharp gains in the
U.S. dollar may continue in coming days as investors adjust to
an outlook for slower global economic growth, favoring the
perceived safety of the greenback.
 The dollar was on track on Friday for its biggest weekly
advance against a basket of currencies in nearly two years, and
a close in euro/dollar below support at 1.2777 may help
consolidate the risk-averse sentiment, paving the way to
further declines in the pair, traders said.
 At midday on Friday, the euro was down 0.5 percent at
$1.2764  after falling to a session trough of $1.2753.
 Demand for the dollar rebounded this week as the
combination of lackluster data both in the United States and
China and soft debt actions in Europe led investors to
""re-price"" growth expectations, scaling back bets that boosted
higher-yielding currencies such as the euro, the Australian and
New Zealand dollars in recent weeks. For details, see
[ID:nLDE67C0V6] and [ID:nTOE67A01A]
 The moves were compounded by the Federal Reserve's
announcement on Tuesday that it would reinvest money from
maturing mortgage bonds into government debt to boost a
flagging economy. [ID:nN09275781]
 Investors perceived the Fed's plans as a sign of concern
with the outlook for the U.S. economy.
 ""Pessimism has gained new momentum this week, carrying the
dollar higher in a safe-haven bid,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, a
currency strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York. ""In this
risk averse scenario, we see the dollar still strengthening in
the short term.""
 Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets Inc in
Chicago, agrees. He said risk aversion seems to be ""the prudent
play."" In the absence of positive news likely to come from
anywhere, euro/dollar below 1.28 may hold, he added.
 According to Reuters data, one-month euro/dollar risk
reversals were at -1.95 on Friday , dropping from
-1.20 at the start of the week, and with a bias toward euro
puts and dollar calls.
 That indicates more investors are betting the euro will
fall than rise.
 At the same time, implied volatility in one-month
euro/dollar options hit as high as 12.05 percent  on
Friday, up from 10.60 on Monday. The higher the volatility, the
higher the overall level of risk aversion in markets.
 EURO PERIPHERY JITTERS
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, a gauge of the
greenback's performance against six major currencies, was last
trading up at 82.882 <.DXY>. At current prices, it was tracking
a weekly rise of 2.88 percent, its best since October 2008.
 Meanwhile, the euro  was on track to fall almost 4
percent against the dollar on the week, its biggest drop since
May.
 After rallying earlier this month, sentiment on the euro
soured this week on concerns over the cost of support for the
Irish banking sector and Greek GDP shrinking more than
expected. Those negative headlines tapped investor fears about
the underlying fiscal problems of the bloc's heavily indebted
states. [ID:nLDE67C153]
 Traders are now focusing on whether the euro will hold
below $1.2777, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement from the
pair's low set on June 7 to its high on Aug. 6, traders said.
 The next key level is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement
around $1.2605-1.2610.
 U.S. economic data next week include readings on producer
prices, housing starts and industry output for July. The
Treasury will also report on capital inflows on Monday. 
 MORE YEN GAINS?
 The yen, which hit 15-year highs against the dollar earlier
this week, pulled back on news Japan's prime minister and the
central bank chief would meet next week to discuss the
appreciation in the Japanese currency. [ID:nTOE67B07V]
 Japanese authorities heightened their rhetoric, and the
Bank of Japan was seen checking rates on Thursday after the yen
climbed to 84.72 yen on Wednesday, its highest since July 1995.
On Friday, the dollar was trading at 86.26 yen .
 Still, traders say the increased intervention rhetoric by
Japanese authorities will not be able to prevent the yen from
gaining, especially during times of global uncertainty.
 The yen is also seen as a safe-haven asset.
 ""The Japanese need consensus from Euroland and U.S. to
intervene, they just don't have it yet, and won't get it for
some time, not in this environment,"" said Brad Bechtel, a
managing director at Faros Trading LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut.

 EURO STUMBLES
 The euro fell to fresh three-week lows against the U.S.
dollar, retreating from the highs fueled by Germany's upside
economic surprise.
 In midmorning trade the euro dropped as low as $1.2758
, its weakest level since July 22, according to Reuters
data. It was last at $1.2766, down 0.4 percent on the day and
approaching a fall of nearly 3.7 percent this week.
 Adam Cole, global head of currency strategy at RBC, said
concerns about fiscal and banking problems in countries on the
euro zone periphery may weigh on the shared European currency
over the medium term.
 ""The peripherals are still weak, and how the euro trades
depends on whether the market focuses on the strong core or the
weak peripherals, and the risk is they will focus on the weak,""
he said.
 The dollar rose 0.32 percent against a currency basket of
major trading partners <.DXY>.
 Against the yen  the greenback was up 0.43 percent at
86.30 yen, hovering above a 15-year trough of 84.72 yen hit
earlier this week.
 The yen has pulled back slightly from those gains on
speculation that Japanese authorities may act to stem its
strength, but few expect actual intervention unless the dollar
drops near its record low of 79.75 yen or the trend becomes
more volatile.
 U.S. Treasury bond yields fell on fresh safe-haven buying.
The 30-year Treasury yield  hit a three week low of
3.880 after the U.S. data pointed to low growth and low
inflation. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields dropped to 2.70
percent .
 September Bund futures  hit a record high at
131.44, surpassing the previous peak at 131.40 set on Thursday,
and were last up 12 ticks on the day at 131.34. The 10-year

 U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 22 cents to $75.52

 NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Friday
and headed for its strongest weekly performance in almost two
years against a basket of currencies after lackluster results
in an Italian bond auction weighed on the euro.
 The euro zone single currency fell to a three-week low
against the dollar as spreads between peripheral European and
German government bond yields widened on debt worries and as
euro/sterling tumbled.
 The greenback had been under heavy selling pressure since
early June as investors increasingly focused on deteriorating
economic conditions in the United States. But the currency
rebounded sharply this week on a growing view that if the U.S.
economy is slowing materially, it is not alone.
 ""This contraction in risk this week in the equity market
has seen a reversal in a number of market trends that had been
in place for the past month or two, including the decline in
the dollar,"" said Robert Lynch, currency strategist at HSBC in
New York.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, a gauge of the
greenback's performance against six major currencies, was last
up 0.3 percent at 82.895 after hitting a high of 82.938, the
strongest level since late July.
 On the week, it was tracking a rise of 3.14 percent, its
strongest performance since October 2008.
 The euro was down 0.5 percent at $1.2764 after falling to a
session trough of $1.2753, the lowest since July 22, according
to Reuters data. It was on track to fall 4 percent against the
dollar this week, the most since May.
 Underscoring concerns about peripheral economies, the
spread between 10-year Greek and German bonds widened to its
highest since the European Central Bank began its bond-buying
operation on May 10. The spread between Spanish and benchmark
German 10-year government bonds also widened.
 Earlier the euro had risen after data showed Germany's
economy grew more than expected in the second quarter.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 86.39 yen,
according to Reuters data, before retreating to 86.24, up 0.3
percent. Resistance was seen ahead of stops at 86.50 yen. The
dollar hit 15-year lows of 84.72 yen on electronic trading
platform EBS earlier this week.
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa may meet as early as next week to
discuss the yen's strength.
 Market players say they do not expect actual intervention
unless the dollar makes a move towards its record low of 79.75
yen, or the drop becomes more volatile.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday after
lackluster results in an Italian bond auction renewed worries
about the euro zone peripheral economies and offset strong
German growth data.
 The U.S. dollar headed for its best weekly performance
since early 2009 against a basket of currencies after concerns
about the U.S. and global economic outlook prompted investors
to dump riskier assets and seek safety in the greenback.
 ""Subtle fears that the problems in Europe have not
evaporated were highlighted well this week by the focus on the
weaker than expected Italian bond auction,"" said Camilla
Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 ""Today's (economic) releases were positive for euro,"" she
said. ""The inability to rally on good news is never a good
sign.""
 In early New York trading, the euro was down 0.1 percent at
$1.2814, having risen to a session high of $1.2906, according
to Reuters data. It was on track to fall 3.6 percent against
the dollar on the week, its biggest drop since May.
 Losses in the euro accelerated after the currency fell
below $1.2820, triggering stop loss orders.
 Underscoring concerns about peripheral economies, the
spread between Spanish and benchmark German 10-year government
bonds widened to 172 basis points, the highest since July 19.
The spread between 10-year Greek and German bonds went out to
its widest since late June.
 Earlier, the euro had risen after data showed Germany's
economy grew more than expected in the second quarter.
 Growth for the entire euro zone rose 1.0 percent in the
second quarter, but some peripheral economies were struggling,
highlighting the two-speed nature of the euro zone's recovery.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, a gauge of the
greenback's performance against six major currencies, was
slightly higher at 82.670. On the week, it was tracking a rise
of 2.88 percent, its best since January, 2009.
 The greenback briefly lost some ground after U.S. data
showing a rebound in retail sales and higher consumer prices
soothed some fears about the U.S. recovery.
 ""There was a sigh of relief in the currency market when
traders realized that retail sales last month was not abysmal.
This has led to a rebound in the euro, pound and dollar/yen,
said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New
York.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 86.21 yen,
according to Reuters data, before retreating to 85.85 yen, down
0.1 percent. Resistance was seen ahead of stops at 86.30/50
yen.

785,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2010 08:48AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Refuge in cash harbour as QE2 looms," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Investors who bought stocks in
early 2010 are in the red and many may be tempted to switch into
cash -- despite the risk that some central banks will renew
efforts to make money more plentiful and therefore cheaper.
 Looking beyond Friday's evidence of startlingly strong
German economic growth in the second quarter, many think the
global economic recovery is already losing momentum.
 The U.S. labour and housing markets remain sluggish, while
slowing growth in China's investment and factory output and
weaker retail sales portray softening domestic demand there.
 Over the past week the Federal Reserve has decided to buy
more government debt with the cash from maturing mortgage bonds
it holds, possibly heralding the start of more aggressive
monetary easing. The Bank of England also left the door open for
more easing after it cut its forecast for UK economic growth.
 Monetary easing in theory should encourage investors to buy
risky and higher-yielding assets as the return on cash
diminishes. But with a threat of a return to recession, cash
preservation might be more of a priority for some investors.
 Backing up this point, fund tracker EPFR's data shows
investors poured another $5.1 billion in the latest week into
money market funds, which posted their first three week run of
inflows since the first quarter of 2009.
 ""Quantitative easing is likely to bring diminishing and
ultimately negative returns,"" noted Max King, multi-asset
portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management.
 ""The signal from markets that the global economy is at risk
of a renewed downturn, perhaps caused by policy mistakes, could
be right. Investors should not rush to liquidate investments
...but should consider keeping a sizeable cash reserve for the
opportunities the continuing financial crisis is likely to throw
up.""
 Separate data from the industry's Money Fund Report shows
U.S. money market fund assets rose by $10.3 billion to $2.8
trillion in the latest week.
Various speeches from Fed officials and the minutes of the
Bank of England's August monetary policy meeting, due in the
coming week, should give more clues about the possibility of
further easing on both sides of the Atlantic.
 
 INTO SAFE HARBOUR
 The renewed rush to money market funds -- unloved asset
classes during the risk rally in 2009 -- reflects disappointment
over stock market returns.
 World stocks, measured by MSCI, are down more than 4 percent
this year, having risen 31 percent in 2009. Even emerging market
stocks are slightly down from the beginning of this year.
 ""The continued commitment to stimulus should be good for
risk assets. But the market is focused very heavily on the
prospects of a double dip and on weaker demand,"" said Mark
Konyn, Asia-Pacific chief executive of RCM.
 ""Meanwhile, cash is still building up with several
institutions and there is a reluctance to allocate that cash.""
 Swiss-based wealth manager Sarasin is overweight on money
markets, and has just reduced its commodities weighting to
neutral from overweight. 
 ""The expected slowdown in growth harbours significant risks,
which is why we remain tactically neutral,"" Philipp Bartschi,
chief strategist at Sarasin, said in a note clients.
 ""We do not see any more potential for bonds at this level.
We therefore remain underweight and have parked the proceeds
from the sale of commodity assets in the money market.""
As for cash, U.S. fixed income manager PIMCO believes
investing just beyond the money market spectrum -- in 15- or
18-month maturities rather than 13-month, for example -- is
attractive especially as new, more restrictive U.S. regulation
is set to compress money market yields.
 The new Rule 2a-7 means money market funds must restrict
their underlying holdings to investments that have more
conservative maturities and credit ratings than before. They
also need to maintain more liquidity.
 The changes were spurred by a key U.S. manager, Reserve
Primary Fund, ""breaking the buck"" when its net asset value per
share fell below $1 at the height of the financial crisis in
2008.
 ""We strongly believe that the new 2a-7 regulatory changes
will have a dampening effect on money market yields and that the
demand for true liquidity will be very costly in terms of yield
performance,"" PIMCO said in a note to clients.
 However, it added, the changes also increase opportunities
for investors who don't need immediate liquidity to seek higher
returns just outside the rule's boundary.

 LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The euro turned lower on Friday,
giving up modest gains as worries about peripheral economies
returned to dog investors who were briefly encouraged by strong
German growth data earlier in the session.
 Traders said stop-loss selling in the euro accelerated after
the single currency fell below $1.2820. The latest drop in the
euro came as the spread between Spanish and benchmark German
10-year government bonds widened to 172 basis points, the
highest since July 19.
 The spread between 10-year Greek and German bonds went out
to its widest since late June after uninspiring results in an
Italian bond auction prompted investors to pare positions in the
euro on debt concerns.
 Earlier, the euro had risen after data showed Germany's
economy grew more than expected in the second quarter. German
preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.2 percent in the
three months to June, much higher than forecasts for a 1.3
percent gain.
 Growth for the entire euro zone rose 1.0 percent in the
second quarter, but some peripheral economies were struggling,
highlighting the two-speed nature of the euro zone's recovery.
 But the boost for the euro turned out to be short-lived with
many using the bounce to sell.
 ""The euro failed to hold on to the gains made after the
German GDP numbers as the peripheral economies are still
struggling and worries about a global recovery remain,"" said Ian
Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""With risk appetite falling and volatilities rising, we
could see the euro fall as low as $1.2735, which is technically
pretty significant."" 
 That level was the low struck on July 22.
 By 1106 GMT, the euro was down 0.2 percent from late U.S.
trade on Thursday at $1.2805, having risen to a session high of
$1.2906. It was on track to fall 3.4 percent against the dollar
on the week, its biggest drop since mid-May.
 On Wednesday, the dollar logged its biggest one-day
percentage rise against the euro since October 2008, as concerns
about the global economic outlook prompted investors to cut
positions in riskier assets.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against six major currencies, was unchanged at 82.63, after
rising 0.4 percent on Thursday. On the week, it was tracking a
rise of 2.6 percent, its best since mid-May.
 Traders will eye U.S. retail sales, which will give a first
look into consumer spending in the third quarter. U.S. consumer
inflation is expected to show a rise of 0.2 percent in July.
 
 UPWARD BIAS FOR YEN
 The yen, which hit 15-year highs against the dollar earlier
this week, pulled back on news Japan's prime minister and the
central bank chief would meet next week to discuss the yen.
 The greenback stood at 85.68 yen after rising to 86.21 yen.
Resistance was seen ahead of stops at 86.30/50 yen.
 Japanese authorities heightened their rhetoric, and the Bank
of Japan was seen checking rates on Thursday after the yen
climbed to 84.72 yen on Wednesday, its highest since July 1995.
 ""We're seeing a bit of a pullback on worries of what might
happen over the weekend, but we see the risk of intervention as
low, and have a positive view on the yen,"" said Adam Cole,
global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 Market players say they do not expect actual intervention
unless the dollar makes a move towards its record low of 79.75
yen, or the drop becomes more volatile.
 ""This is an opportunity to cover some short (dollar)
positions, but traders are likely to continue to target a break
of 80 yen,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of foreign
securities at Okasan Securities.

 * Major union group COSATU to respond on Tuesday
 * Pressure on government to reach deal
(Changes dateline to PRETORIA, recasts with news briefing)
 
 By Peroshni Govender
 PRETORIA, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Major South African public
sector unions will respond next week to a revised government pay
offer, suspending for several days a threatened mass strike they
said would bring services to a halt, officials said on Friday.
 The offer has temporarily defused tensions after the unions
gave the government an ultimatum to come up with a better deal
and may have caused a few cracks in the coalition of unions,
with some groups looking favourably on the offer, labour sources
who asked not to be named said.
 Unions in the country's largest labour umbrella group COSATU
said they would reply on Tuesday to the new offer that is likely
to swell the budget as the government tries to bring the deficit
down from 6.7 percent of gross domestic product.
 ""We recognise the increase from the employer but we still
feel it is a long way from our initial demands,"" said Fikile
Majola of the NEHAWU union, which is affiliated with COSATU.
 A separate state workers' union not affiliated with COSATU
said it would take a week to respond to the offer.
The government on Thursday improved its offer to a coalition
of unions representing about 1.3 million state workers who
staged a one-day strike on Tuesday and then threatened a
prolonged strike starting as early as Friday.
 The government offered to increase the monthly housing
allowance to 700 rand ($95) from a previous offer of 630 rand,
but kept its wage rise offer at 7 percent. The housing allowance
alone would be equal to about 1 percent of budget spending.
 The unions are demanding an 8.6 percent pay rise, more than
double the inflation rate, and 1,000 rand for housing.
 The strike threat has put pressure on the ruling African
National Congress, which has a long alliance with organised
labour, to reach a deal to prevent what could be the biggest
civil servants strike in three years.
 The public service minister said the government would be
forced to make cuts elsewhere, which could stoke anger among the
poor at President Jacob Zuma, who has already faced protests for
not doing enough to provide them with better schools, housing,
security and utility services.
 A mid-grade public sector employee now makes on average
8,800 rand a month in salary and benefits, above the national
average wage of 6,383 rand, according to government figures.
 Separately, he National Union of Mineworkers said its latest
wage talks with Impala Platinum had collapsed and the union
would consult its members next week on whether to embark on a
strike.

 BRUSSELS, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The European Union has begun to
investigate whether Asian producers of alcohol solutions used in
cosmetics and cleaning products are dumping their goods on the
EU market, a move that could lead to extra EU import tariffs.
 The investigation follows a complaint by two German
producers of fatty acids that Indian, Malaysian and Indonesian
exporters are undercutting market prices illegally, the EU's
executive Commission said Friday.
 German specialty chemicals producer Cognis GmbH and a German
subsidiary of South African petrochemicals group Sasol lodged

789,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2010 06:20AM ET</span>",Basel proposals bring no comfort to trade finance," * Basel rules eased for derivatives, not trade finance
 * Default database presents results of pilot
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Recent amendments from the Basel
Committee on banking regulation do not appear to meet the
concern of practitioners of trade finance that proposed new
rules could make the vital loans scarcer and more expensive.
 Bankers and lawyers are still deciphering the revisions. But
several say they still have their work cut out to convince
regulators that the $10 trillion market, the lifeblood of global
trade, is much less risky than other forms of lending.
 ""From what we can tell so far, on the specific trade issue,
I don't see that they've made any change at all,"" Dan Taylor,
President of BAFT-IFSA, an international association
representing bankers in trade finance, told Reuters.
 Banks fear the proposed new rules, known as Basel III, will
hit trade finance particularly hard, hurting the 80-90 percent
of the $12-13 trillion in world trade that depends on the loans.
 Published in December, the rules would impose a leverage
ratio on banks requiring them to set aside capital equivalent to
the value of off-balance-sheet items.
 Many banks hid toxic assets off their balance sheets, a
cause of the financial crisis when those assets fell in value as
markets weakened. The new rules aim to discourage a repeat.
 But documentary letters of credit -- the short-term loans
collateralised on cargoes that have formed the bulk of trade
finance for centuries -- are also held off balance sheets.
 A requirement to fully capitalise such loans instead of
providing capital at 10 or 20 percent of their value as at
present would make them much less profitable for the banks.
 Major players in trade finance include Deutsche Bank, Royal
Bank of Scotland and Citibank.
 
 CAUGHT IN THE NET
 Revisions to the proposals issued at the end of July after
consultations did seem to soften the treatment of derivatives,
but not of trade finance, bankers and lawyers said.
 Practitioners do not believe the Basel committee of central
bankers and bank supervisors is targeting trade as such.
 ""It's more that letters of credit are caught in the net of
trying to sweep up everything that is off balance sheet with the
leverage ratio rather than something specifically against us,""
said one trade finance expert.
 Many people interviewed did not want to be quoted by name
for fear of appearing to lobby the regulators too aggressively.
 November's summit of the G20 in Seoul will be largely
devoted to the Basel proposals on re-regulation, and there is
little appetite now for carve-outs and exceptions.
 Trade finance is a low-risk, low-remuneration business, and
if profitability falls, the bankers who provide it will have a
harder time arguing for funds in their banks' credit committees.
 After slumping in late 2008/early 2009, flows of trade
finance have largely returned to pre-crisis levels, helped by a
$250 billion package from international institutions agreed at
the G20 summit in London in April last year.
 But exporters in some countries in Africa, Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, and some small businesses even in rich
countries, are still finding it hard to access funds.
 They could be locked out altogether if the market contracts
again -- unless better capitalised banks in emerging economies
spot an opportunity for business as trade rebounds generally.
 ""Any increase in the cost of financing will eventually be
passed on to exporters, which means developing countries,"" said
one trade finance lawyer.
 The World Trade Organization, which does not want to be seen
as a lobbyist for banks, is not commenting on the latest drafts.
 But WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy, fearing renewed
disruption to trade finance could derail this year's recovery in
trade, brought regulators and trade finance bankers together in
May.
 The International Chamber of Commerce, which sets trade
finance standards, met regulators in Frankfurt in early June.
The chamber is now managing a project to pool data from
trade finance banks from 2005 to 2009 to demonstrate just how
safe trade finance is. It has just sent results from a pilot
with a small number of banks to regulators.
 The data look at the rates of default in particular trade
finance products, and recovery rates for banks in defaults. It
will also examine specific factors in trade products that may
reduce the likelihood of a transaction resulting in a default.
 ""We hope that the data will provide an initial platform for
discussion with the regulators on issues relating to trade
finance in the Basel framework, including the Basel-III
package,"" project manager Andrew Wilson told Reuters.

 LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The euro rallied in relief on
Friday when data showed Germany's economy grew more than
expected in the second quarter, but concerns about weaker
economies on the euro zone periphery could weigh on any rebound.
 German preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.2
percent in the three months to June, much higher than forecasts
for a 1.3 percent gain.
 Growth for the entire euro zone rose 1.0 percent in the

 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 13 (Reuters) - A major South African

the ballpark,"" Manie De Clerq, spokesman for the Public
Servants Association union and its more than 200,000 members,
told Reuters.
 ""It will take about a week for the workers to decide on
whether to accept the offer.""
 The government offered to increase the monthly housing
allowance to 700 rand ($95) from a previous offer of 630 rand,
but kept its wage rise offer at 7 percent. The unions are
demanding an 8.6 percent pay rise and 1,000 rand for housing.
 Representatives from the other unions in the coalition plan
a news briefing later on Friday but are not likely to make good
on their threats for a mass strike in the next few days to that
they can allow their members to consider the offer.
 The strike threat has put pressure on the ruling African
National Congress, which has a long alliance with organised
labour, to reach a deal to prevent what could be the biggest
civil servants strike in three years.
 The government has said it cannot afford the unions' demands
and any deal will swell state spending as it tries to bring the
deficit down from 6.7 percent of gross domestic product.
 The public service minister said the government would be
forced to make cuts elsewhere, which could stoke anger among the
poor at President Jacob Zuma, who has already faced protests for
not doing enough to provide them with better schools, housing,
security and utility services.
 A mid-grade public sector employee now makes on average
8,800 rand a month in salary and benefits, above the national
average wage of 6,383 rand, according to government figures.
 Separately, he National Union of Mineworkers said its latest
wage talks with Impala Platinum had collapsed and the union
would consult its members next week on whether to embark on a
strike.

 * Europe stocks fall, initial gains on German GDP fizzle
 * Euro slips vs dollar, euro zone growth seen unsustainable
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - European stocks fell on Friday
while the euro also slipped as assets considered to be higher
risk relinquished early gains after initial euphoria from a
surprisingly strong German economic growth data fizzled out.
 Official data showed the German economy grew by 2.2 percent
in the second quarter -- dwarfing forecasts for a 1.3 percent
rise to post its biggest gain since reunification and boosting
overall growth in the euro zone.
 Stock prices and the euro had rallied in an initial reaction
to the data, but investors quickly booked profits, reckoning
that euro zone countries would struggle to maintain the pace of
growth in the second half of the year.
 Analysts said this week's underlying downward trend in
risk-sensitive assets was hard to dislodge after the U.S.
Federal Reserve said it would address a slowdown in the U.S.
economic recovery by picking up more Treasuries.
 Investors were also unwilling to hold on to risky positions
ahead of U.S. data on consumer prices and retail sales due later
on Friday.
 ""The broadening perception is that the strong GDP represents
the peak of the bounce (in the economic recovery),"" said Ashraf
Laidi, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.
 He said few investors were willing to stay long on risk
given that U.S. share prices have fallen around 3 percent so far
this week on growing speculation that the pace of the global
economic recovery is slowing.
 ""When the market drops in the way it has in the past three
days ... the bulls will just go and hand the week over to the
bears, and won't bother fighting the trend,"" he said.

 EARLY RALLY FIZZLES
 By 1122 GMT, the MSCI world equity index was flat on the
day, reversing gains of roughly 0.5 percent early in the
session. It hovered near a three-week low the previous day.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2800, retreating from the
day's high of $1.2906 hit after the German data.
 On Thursday, it fell as low as $1.2779, its weakest since
late July, and on the week the single currency is on track to
fall nearly 3.7 percent.
 The dollar was little changed against a currency basket,
pulling back from an early slide.
 S&P futures slipped 0.3 percent while Dow Jones futures
were down slightly on the day. U.S. crude oil prices were up
0.3 percent at $75.97, paring early gains.
 German government Bund futures were up slightly at 131.33,
recovering from losses in early trade.
 Adam Cole, global head of currency strategy at RBC, said the
strong GDP data had initially sparked some demand for riskier
assets, which had tumbled earlier this week on U.S. and global
growth concerns.
 He said concerns about fiscal and banking problems in
countries on the euro zone periphery may weigh on the shared
European currency over the medium term.
 ""The peripherals are still weak, and how the euro trades
depends on whether the market focuses on the strong core or the
weak peripherals, and the risk is they will focus on the weak,""
he said.
 The dollar was 0.3 percent lower versus the yen at 85.68
yen, but hovered above a 15-year trough of 84.72 yen hit earlier
this week.
 The yen has pulled back slightly from those gains on
speculation that Japanese authorities may act to stem its
strength, but few expect actual intervention unless the dollar
drops near its record low of 79.75 yen or the trend becomes more
volatile.

 LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday after
data showed preliminary German gross domestic product (GDP) rose
more than expected in the second quarter, alleviating some
concerns about the euro zone economy.
 The euro zone's biggest economy rose grew 2.2 percent in the
three months to June, its biggest gain in 23 years, driven by
investment and exports, official data showed. That was much
higher than forecasts for a 1.3-percent gain.
 First-quarter growth was revised up to show growth of 0.5
percent, after being previously reported at 0.2 percent.
 The euro rose to a session high of $1.2906 after the data.
By 0724 GMT, it was up 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade on
Thursday at $1.2880.
 Support was seen near the 100-day moving average at $1.2803.
 But concerns about the euro zone peripherals and the banking
system could weigh on the single currency over the medium term.
 ""The size of the rise in German GDP was a surprise, but a
rise in the core euro zone economies was not a surprise,"" said
Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The peripherals are still weak, and how the euro trades
depends on whether the market focuses on the strong core or the
weak peripherals, and the risk is they will focus on the weak.""
 Separate data showed French GDP rose 0.6 percent in the
second quarter, slightly higher than forecasts for a 0.5 percent
gain.
 Flash euro zone second quarter GDP is due out at 0900 GMT.
 Traders also moved to cover short positions ahead of the
weekend after selling riskier assets earlier.
 On Wednesday, the dollar saw its biggest one-day percentage
rise against the euro since October 2008, as concerns about the
global economic outlook prompted investors to cut positions in
riskier assets.
 Some said euro shorts against the yen were squeezed, pushing
the pair higher. The euro rose 0.4 percent against the yen to
110.71 yen, after hitting a session high of 111.12 yen.
 
 YEN STEADIES FOR NOW
 The yen pulled back after hitting 15-year highs against the
dollar earlier this week on news Japan's prime minister and the
central bank chief would meet next week to discuss the yen.
 The greenback was flat on the day at 85.88 yen after rising
to 86.21 yen. Resistance was seen ahead of stops at 86.30/50
yen.
 Japanese authorities upped their rhetoric and the Bank of
Japan was seen checking rates on Thursday after the yen climbed
to 84.72 yen on Wednesday, its highest since July 1995.
 Market players do not expect actual intervention unless the
dollar drops below 85.00 yen to near its record low of 79.75
yen, or a drop becomes more volatile.
 ""This is an opportunity to cover some short (dollar)
positions, but traders are likely to continue to target a break
of 80 yen,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of foreign
securities at Okasan Securities.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against six major currencies, was down 0.4 percent at 82.271,
after rising 0.4 percent on Thursday.
 On the week, it was tracking a rise of 2.4 percent, its best
since mid-May.
 Traders will closely eye U.S. data, including retail sales
which will give a first inkling on consumer spending in the
third quarter. Inflation data, which is expected to show a rise
of 0.2 percent in July, may hurt the dollar if it comes in
sharply lower than expected, traders said.

loss of 2.8 billion Swiss francs in the first half, less than
the central bank had estimated, as profit from the fund with

losses.
 The SNB said on Friday its overall loss totalled 2.8
billion Swiss francs ($2.65 billion), less than the 4 billion
francs estimated in July.
 The central bank reported a loss of 14.3 billion francs on
its currency reserves, built up through massive interventions,
due to the euro's weakness.
 However the central bank booked a profit of 1.3 billion on
the fund with toxic assets from UBS, acquired as part
of the bailout of Switzerland's largest bank in 2008. The SNB
also made a revaluation gain of 6.8 billion francs on its gold

 The SNB has faced some criticism over its intervention
policy in Switzerland where media and economists have raised
concerns about losses on the large amounts of euros the SNB has
acquired and the effectiveness of intervention.
 Traders say that the central bank has already started to

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The dollar fought its way higher
on the yen on Friday following a report Japan's prime minister
and the head of its central bank would meet to discuss ways to
deal with the Japanese currency's export-sapping strength.
 The greenback clawed its way to 86.08 yen, up 0.2 percent
from late U.S. trading on Thursday, though traders reported
tough resistance ahead of stops at 86.30/50.
 The latest lurch higher came after the Asahi Shimbun
reported Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa may meet as early as next week to
discuss the yen's strength and possible responses.
 A government source later confirmed that the government and
the BOJ are coordinating to set up such a meeting.
 Speculation has been intense that authorities would finally
act on the yen given its strength was hitting stocks and
exports. The BOJ confirmed it had checked forex rates on
Thursday but emphasised it had no levels in mind.
 In the wake of the yen's rise to a 15-year high against the
dollar of 84.72 yen earlier this week on trading platform EBS,
market players say the chances of yen-selling intervention at
some point cannot be ruled out.
 The focus now is on what kind of specific measures the
government or the BOJ may come up with to curb yen strength.
 Judging from what happened in late November to early
December, there is a chance that any extra monetary easing steps
that the Bank of Japan may be mulling could be unveiled before
the possible meeting between Kan and Shirakawa, said Masafumi
Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan for Barclays Capital.
 ""I think there will be a lot of disappointment if any
monetary easing steps by the Bank of Japan are viewed as being
ineffective,"" Yamamoto said.
 ""In that case, authorities may be forced to conduct actual
currency intervention,"" he added.
 BOJ OPTIONS
 Possible options for the BOJ may include steps such as
trying to expand the amount of banks' current account balances
parked at the BOJ, expanding the amount of its fixed-rate fund
supply operation or extending the maturity, Yamamoto said.
 The BOJ held an emergency meeting on Dec. 1 and unveiled a
fixed rate fund supply operation, after the dollar fell below 85
yen in late November. That measure came ahead of a meeting
between then-PM Yukio Hatoyama and Shirakawa.
 Market players say Japanese authorities seem unlikely to
intervene unless the dollar drops below 85.00 yen and gets
closer to its record low of 79.75 yen hit in 1995, or the
greenback's drop against the yen becomes more volatile.
 Analysts say Japanese authorities do not seem eager to
intervene.
 ""The Japanese authorities have no appetite for FX
intervention,"" JPMorgan analysts said.
 ""Not only do they doubt the efficacy of intervention, but
yen-selling would be difficult to justify, given strong G7
rhetoric against currency manipulation,"" they wrote in a note to
clients. ""It is politically unpopular given the magnitude of the
losses on Japan's FX reserve.""
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.2855, with support lower
down at its 100-day moving average at $1.2803.
 Traders felt it could hold in a $1.2762/1.2897 area for now
with the risk of a short-squeeze into euro zone growth data due
later.
 Data from the U.S. includes retail sales, consumer
confidence and the consumer price index, and markets fear
disappointment.
 Matthew Strauss, senior fixed income and currency strategist
at RBC Capital Markets, cautioned that the CPI report could be
more market-moving this time.
 ""With deflation talks dominating economic discussions and
comparisons with Japan's lost decade now a common pastime, CPI
data pose a major risk to USD tonight, maybe even more so than
retail sales,"" he said. ""It is difficult to see how a soft
reading would not negatively impact the dollar.""
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against six major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 82.481,
after rising 0.4 percent on Thursday.
 On the week, it has risen 2.6 percent as worries about the
global economy prompt investors to cut positions in risky assets
and cover short dollar positions.
 The index has resistance at 83.451, its July 21 high, while
support is seen around the previous day's low of 82.109, and
81.96.

 * NZ dollar jumps, debt futures fall
 By Mantik Kusjanto
 WELLINGTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - New Zealand's retail sales
posted the largest rise in three years in the second quarter
but the housing market slowed further in July, leaving markets
divided over the chance of an interest rate rise next month.
 ""Given the broader information we've got, it's going to be
a difficult task for the RBNZ to sell a rate hike this year,
but we'll have to see how the information goes between now and
Sept. 16,"" said Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs.
 Retail sales volumes, which strip out price movements, rose
a seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent in the three months to June
30, with the value of June month sales up 0.9 percent, sharply
above market expectations. [NZ/POLL] 
 Separately, Friday's industry data showed the housing
market remained in the doldrums, with home prices falling and
sales hitting a decade low in July. [ID:nSGE67B04K]
 A slew of recent data has pointed to an economy which is
losing momentum, echoing similar trends in larger advanced
economies such as the United States and prompting analysts to
increasingly question whether the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
will keep raising rates in the short- to medium-term.
 The New Zealand dollar  surged to $0.7128, from
around $0.7080 before the data. Interest rate futures <0#NBB:>
fell as much as five points before trimming their losses.
 Markets are pricing in a 52 percent chance of another rate
hike on Sept 16, up slightly from 50 percent before the data.
Two weeks ago, however, markets were pricing in a 68 percent
chance of a rise. 
 SPLIT VIEW
 Despite the downbeat feel to recent data, some analysts
said the RBNZ could still be expected to raise rates next
month.
 ""The solid spending numbers will probably give the RBNZ
enough leeway to take another small step in the process of
policy normalisation at their September (meeting) before a
hiatus into 2011,"" said RBC Capital Markets strategist Michael
Turner.
 Last month, the RBNZ raised its cash rate by 25 basis
points to 3 percent, its second consecutive hike, but said
further increases would probably be more gradual because of a
subdued economic outlook.
 Markets have trimmed bets over the scale and speed of rate
rises because of sluggish consumption, a stagnant housing
market, and slowing migration, along with a softening global
outlook.
 The labour market has also lost its shine, with
unemployment rising to 6.8 percent in the June quarter, after
it surprised with a sharp fall to 6.0 percent in the March
quarter.
 A further headwind for the economy is the prospect that
dairy giant Fonterra, which accounts for about 7 percent of
GDP, will cut its forecast payout level for farmers in the
coming season because of falling global prices. See
[ID:nSGE67309D]
 Analysts said the strong retail sales reflected heavy
discounting and the likelihood some consumers are buying now to
beat a rise in the sales tax due on Oct. 1, but would still
mean a solid contribution to second quarter growth.
 ""This means we've got a positive start in the countdown to
Q2 GDP, but the discounting clearly means the retailers are
under pressure,"" said Robin Clements, a senior economist at
UBS.
 The economy slowed slightly in the March quarter, but is
still expected by the RBNZ to grow at around 3.5 percent a year
for the next two years.

 By Stanley White and Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa may meet as early
as next week to discuss the yen's strength and possible
responses, although likely options are seen as limited.
 Japanese policymakers have been trying to talk the yen down
this week as it surged to a 15-year high against the dollar, and
the government and the BOJ are now coordinating to set up a
meeting between Kan and Shirakawa that will likely take place in
the second half of next week, government sources said.
 Shirakawa has met Japanese prime ministers before but this
meeting is expected to focus on the yen's gains, which Tokyo
worries will derail a fragile economic recovery and exacerbate
deflation.
 But traders said the yen was still likely to gain longer
term, because Group of Seven countries are unlikely to agree to
joint foreign exchange market intervention to strengthen their
currencies as their own economies are not recovering strongly.
 ""It's really hard to answer the question why other countries
have to intervene just for Japan, when other currencies are
falling due to a weak economic outlook,"" said Tsutomu Soma,
senior manager of foreign securities at Okasan Securities.
 The dollar edged higher on Friday and was around 85.75 yen
by late afternoon in Tokyo, more than a yen above Wednesday's
15-year low of 84.72, on the prospect that Japanese officials
will increase verbal intervention to try to stem yen gains.
 ""This is an opportunity to cover some short (dollar)
positions, but traders are likely to continue to target a break
of 80 yen,"" Soma said.
 VOLLEY OF COMMENTS
 A group of junior lawmakers in the ruling Democratic Party
called on the government and the BOJ to use currency
intervention and quantitative easing to bring the yen toward 110
per dollar, Yoichi Kaneko, a leading member of the group, said
on Friday.
 The group has made similar proposals in the past, but the
government has not reflected its ideas in policy decisions.
 Japan policymakers fired off a volley of comments on
Thursday to curb yen strength and the central bank checked rates
with banks as officials stepped up efforts to prevent the
currency from harming the economic recovery.
 The economy's growth likely slowed to 0.6 percent in
April-June from a 1.2 percent expansion in the previous quarter
as export growth moderated and the boost to consumer spending
from government incentives faded, a Reuters poll of economists
showed. The data is due on Aug. 16.
 The yen has risen steadily against the dollar since early
May, gaining more than 10 percent and closing in on its 1995
record high of 79.75 per dollar, fuelling currency market
speculation that Japan might intervene.
 Japan's authorities have not intervened to protect exporters
from a strong currency since March 2004, when a 15-month yen
selling spree came to an end.
 Currency market intervention is seen as difficult, whether
jointly with other countries or alone, although market players
say the chance of solo action increases the closer the yen gets
to 80 per dollar and if its rise accelerates to a pace of 2 to 3
yen per day.
 The other wild card is the Nikkei share average. Market
players say a steep drop in the stock market benchmark would
also alarm authorities and could be another catalyst for action.
 Other options include policy steps by the central bank, such
as expanding a funding operation launched last December to pump
more cash into the banking system, which is seen as the most
likely option, or buying more government bonds.
 Japanese manufacturers' confidence rose to the highest in
nearly three years in August due to government stimulus, but
companies forecast for the first time in three years that their
sentiment will deteriorate as the strong yen threatens
exporters' earnings, a Reuters poll showed.
 Some BOJ board members believe there is a need to watch the
impact of the yen's rise and the stock market decline on the
economy, minutes of the bank's July 14-15 meeting showed on
Friday.
 Some members also said the yen had appreciated in part
because investors had no better alternative than to buy yen as
safe assets.

 NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Global stocks slid and the
U.S. dollar strengthened on Thursday after weakness in the
American jobs market sapped the appetite for risk, driving gold
to its biggest one-day gain in more than two months.
 First-time jobless benefits claims unexpectedly rose to
their highest in almost six months, fueling fresh concerns of a
faltering U.S. economic recovery. For details, see

 The dollar extended its previous day's strong gains on the
weak U.S. jobs data. Softer-than-expected euro zone data also
spurred safe-haven demand for the dollar, as worries about the
global economy prompted investors to dump risky assets.
 Gold prices hit a four-week high despite the strong dollar
and two days of sharp equity market losses, which were sparked
by the Federal Reserve's downgrade of its economic outlook.
 ""With the weak job report and everything else we heard in
the past couple of days, you are finding a safe-haven bid in
gold,"" said Fred Schoenstein, a trader at Heraeus Precious
Metals Management in New York.
 Gold for December delivery in New York  settled up
$17.50, or 1.5 percent, at $1,216.70 an ounce. It was the
biggest one-day percentage gain for the contract since June 7.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 OTTAWA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar ended its
two-day slide against the U.S. currency on Thursday, reclaiming
some of the ground it had lost because of growing doubts about
the outlook for the global economy.
 The currency approached the key level of C$1.05 to the U.S.
dollar, but when it did not break through this mark it gained a
little momentum higher with no major Canadian economic releases
scheduled for the day.
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0428 to the
U.S. dollar, or 95.90 U.S. cents, up moderately from
Wednesday's finish at C$1.0453 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.67
U.S. cents.
 ""Overall the Canadian dollar is outperforming today,"" said
Tyson Wright, senior foreign exchange trader at Custom House, a
currency services firm in British Columbia.
 ""It's consolidated right under that C$1.05 mark. I think
the relative economics are coming into play right now.""
 Wright said the U.S. economy was a concern and, because the
United States is by far Canada's biggest trading partner, the
Canadian dollar could come under pressure in the medium term.
 The currency slid as low as C$1.0494 to the U.S. dollar, or
95.29 U.S. cents. Wright noted ""a lot"" of resistance around the
C$1.0475-C$1.05 area, but said the currency remains in the
broad range of C$1.01-C$1.0750, where it has been for months.
 ""We're right in the middle of that. That seems pretty
appropriate as a tug of war between the risk and the economic
fundamentals. On balance, that should keep us contained in this
range,"" he said.
 The currency had slumped for two straight sessions, hitting
a three-week low, as fears mounted about the global recovery
and the struggling U.S. economy in particular. A spate of weak
data from China added to worries about slowing global growth.
 ""There are a number of influences that are somewhat
conflicted in terms of where to push the Canadian dollar in
terms of its breakout. A week ago, it was below C$1.02 and now
it's looking at potentially trading above C$1.05,"" said Jack
Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange at National Bank
Financial.
 Piercing C$1.05, he added, could send the currency as weak
as C$1.0587 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.46 U.S. cents, a level
last seen on July 20.
 BONDS WEAKER
 Canadian bond prices were weaker across the curve on
profit-taking, following big gains made over the last several
days on the back of the dimming world economic outlook.
 Fresh signs of a weak U.S. labor market were seen in the
weekly claims data, lending early support to bonds. That built
on two days of gains made after the U.S. Federal Reserve
downgraded its assessment of the economy and said it would take
measures to help the U.S. recovery from stalling more.
[ID:nN1274714]
 But as equity markets cut losses, the prices for less risky
government debt market moved into negative territory.
 ""The bond market rallied fairly decently early on when we
got the jobless claims figures and it's sort of been crawling
back as the day's progressed,"" said Mark Chandler, head of
Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital
Markets.
 ""Overall, yields are still relatively low and still facing
the hangover from the FOMC.""
 The two-year bond  dipped 4 Canadian cents to
yield 1.359 percent, while the 10-year bond  lost 32
Canadian cents to yield 3.007 percent. Canadian bonds mostly
outperformed their U.S. counterparts across the curve.

 By Wanfeng Zhou and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against
major currencies on Thursday, extending the previous day's
gains, as an unexpected rise in U.S. weekly jobless claims and
weaker-than-expected euro zone data spurred safe-haven demand.
 The euro earlier slid to a three-week low against the
dollar after figures showed Greece's economy shrank more than
expected in the second quarter, while euro zone industrial
production unexpectedly declined in June.
 Separate data showed the number of Americans filing new
claims for unemployment insurance unexpectedly rose in the
latest week to its highest in nearly six months, the latest
sign of a flagging U.S. economic recovery. The U.S. and
euro zone data followed a gloomier outlook from the Federal
Reserve and weak Chinese data earlier this week, underscoring
worries about the global economy and prompting investors to
dump risky assets.
 ""It seems like the negative correlation between bad news
and the U.S. dollar is back,"" said Brendan McGrath, manager of
business solutions at Custom House, a Western Union company, in
Victoria, British Columbia.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which measures the
greenback versus a basket of major currencies, rose 0.4 percent
to 82.612, after hitting a session peak of 82.786, its highest
since late July.
 The greenback had come under heavy selling pressure since
early June as investors increasingly focused on deteriorating
economic conditions in the United States. But the currency has
rebounded sharply this week on a growing view that if the U.S.
economy is slowing materially, it is not alone.
 ""Investors were aware of a slowdown in the U.S. economic
recovery, but now there are concerns other economies won't be
able to decouple from slower growth here and in China,"" said
Jessica Hoversen, fixed income and currency analyst at MF
Global in Chicago. ""Markets are re-pricing and with that, we
are likely to see some dollar strength.""
 Custom House's McGrath cautioned, however, that while the
dollar may see a bit of a rebound, ""a prolonged stage of dollar
strength"" seems unlikely. ""The prospect for the U.S. economy is
still quite dismal. The fundamentals are still going to weigh
on it in the long term, especially if the Fed has to adopt more
quantitative easing measures.""
 DOLLAR HOLDS ABOVE 85 YEN
 The euro fell as low as $1.2782, according to Reuters data.
It was last up 0.2 percent at $1.2856 as U.S. stocks came off
their worst levels. Some traders also noted buying by Asian
central banks and a Swiss private bank.
 The single euro zone currency tumbled 2.6 percent on
Wednesday, its biggest one-day loss since October 2008.
 Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto, said euro/dollar has broken below key
technical levels during its decline this week and momentum
continues to favor further losses.
 The next key support level comes in at around $1.2777, the
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement from the pair's low set on
June 7 to its high on Aug. 6, traders said.
 The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 85.84 yen after rising as
high as 86.03, according to Reuters data. It fell to a 15-year
low on Wednesday at 84.72 on electronic trading platform EBS,
fueled by a narrowing spread between U.S. and Japanese
government bond yields.
 The dollar had bounced against the yen earlier in the
global session after market sources told Reuters the Bank of
Japan checked exchange rates with banks. Japanese Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda reiterated the government's position
that it is closely watching currency movements and that
disorderly moves would hurt the economy.
 Noda's comments came after Japanese Prime Minister Naoto
Kan was quoted as saying yen moves have been ""rough,"" and some
analysts said this suggested Japanese authorities may be
stepping up efforts to rein in yen strength. (Editing by

 * Needs to cut budget expenses more
 * General govt deficit forecast to be 8.1 pct of GDP in 2010
 
 (Adds background and quotes)
 By Aija Braslina
 RIGA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Latvia needs additional budget cuts
to regain competitiveness as its recovery remains fragile, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday.
 ""Although near-term vulnerabilities have declined
substantially, the recovery is still fragile and significant
medium-term challenges remain toward the goal of euro adoption,""
the IMF said in a statement.
 Latvia was forced to take a 7.5 billion euro ($9.6 billion)
rescue package led by the IMF to stabilise its finances as its
economy sank into a deep recession.
 The IMF welcomed the difficult fiscal and financial sector
reforms, saying they had helped stabilise the economy after an
18 percent plunge in 2009.
 However, the international lender emphasised that
considerable fiscal adjustment was still needed, especially on
the expenditure side, to preserve debt sustainability and lower
the deficit in line with Maastricht criteria.
 Under the bailout terms, Latvia has pledged to cut its
budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by
2012 to adopt the euro.
 Latvia has pegged the lat to the euro and refused to devalue
despite a contraction in the economy and soaring unemployment.
Instead, it chose to implement an internal devaluation through
hard austerity measures.
 ""Additional wage and price adjustment, together with
structural reforms, would help close any remaining
competitiveness gap, further enhance confidence in the
quasi-currency board exchange rate regime,"" IMF said. 
 The IMF also emphasised the need to ensure that banks fully
comply with regulations and maintain adequate provisioning
against nonperforming loans.
 
 EURO HURDLES
 Latvia's economy expanded for the second consecutive quarter
in April-June thanks to a global recovery and the IMF said
positive annual growth was expected to return in 2011.
 ""However, growth is forecast to remain well below pre-crisis
levels in the medium term,"" it said.
 It also noted that Latvia faced a number of challenges to
entrench stability, raise growth, and meet Maastricht criteria
for euro adoption as quickly as possible.
 According to the IMF these challenges include reducing very
high unemployment, undertaking substantial additional fiscal
adjustment and resolving a large private sector debt overhang
that will inhibit growth.
 It forecast Latvia's economy will contract by 3.5 percent
this year and a budget deficit which will be 8.1 percent of GDP,
little less than an agreed maximum deficit level of 8.5 percent
of GDP.

811,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2010 11:03AM ET</span>",Forex - GBP/USD hovering above daily low after U.S. jobs data,
812,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2010 11:00AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Grain export curbs and WTO rules," Aug 12 (Reuters) - Russia's ban on grain exports as drought
slashes its crops has raised the question whether such bans can
be challenged at the World Trade Organization.
 Russia is not a member of the WTO, but other countries
considering export curbs, such as Ukraine, are.
 This is how WTO rules deal with export restrictions:
 
 * WTO rules are designed to stop its 153 members from
interfering with imports and exports in a way that disrupts
trade or discriminates against other members.
 * In practice, most WTO rules focus on measures to stop
countries blocking imports to shut out competitors' goods to
give their own domestic producers an unfair advantage.
 * Saudi Arabia and other members of the oil cartel OPEC (not
all of whom are members of the WTO) routinely affect exports of
oil by controlling production of oil, most of which is exported.
They have not faced any legal challenges at the WTO.
 * What can be challenged are restrictions on exports
designed to hurt competitors. The United States, European Union
and Mexico are currently suing China at the WTO over Beijing's
export duties and other restraints on raw materials. 
 They argue that these make the raw materials more expensive
for foreign competitors, putting them at a disadvantage to
Chinese processors.
 * In fact many WTO rules have an opt-out for national
security -- whether that is defence, censorship to protect
public morals, helping local banks to protect the financial
system, or food security.
 * Article XI of the WTO's core treaty, the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, says that apart from duties, taxes and
similar charges, you cannot impose any bans or restrictions on
imports or exports such as quotas or licences. But it continues:
 ""The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not
extend to the following:
 ""(a) Export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied
to prevent or relieve critical shortages or foodstuffs or other
products essential to the exporting contracting party... ""
 * So the right of a country to protect its own food supply
is unchallenged. But many economists believe such measures by
individual countries can exacerbate global shortages, as
happened in the 2008 food crisis. It is therefore possible that
the global management food supplies will end up on the agenda of
next month's U.N. summit on the Millennium Development Goals, or
November's G20 summit in Seoul.

 * EU Commission frustrated, calls decision ""unusual""
 * Move will not affect Greece, but could prompt EU censure
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Slovakia's decision to drop out
of an aid package for Greece undermines euro zone unity but it
will not affect the bailout for Athens, and Bratislava may well
have calculated that the repercussions will be slight.
 In an overwhelming parliamentary vote on Wednesday, the euro
zone's poorest member ruled out providing 816 million euros
towards a 110 billion euro ($140 bln) Greek bailout fund, saying
it was unfair to make taxpayers in a country that has kept its
debt under control stump up to bail out a profligate one.
 Slovakia did, however, agree to contribute to a wider safety
net, known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF),
meant to prevent the debt crisis spreading to other euro states.
 The decision on Greece, which largely reflected domestic
concerns and the imperatives of a centre-right government that
has been in power for a month, drew a rebuke from the European
Commission, the EU executive that helped arrange the bailout.
 ""I can only regret this breach of solidarity within the euro
area,"" the EU's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli
Rehn, said in a statement, noting that Slovakia had gone back on
a commitment made by its previous government.
 He said EU finance ministers would discuss the decision when
they next meet on Sept. 6-7.
 Rehn was quick to say move did not endanger loans to Greece,
jointly funded by EU states and the IMF, but it clearly stung.
His spokesman declined at a briefing on Thursday to say what
consequences there might be.
 It is possible that euro zone finance ministers will issue a
verbal statement of disapproval or disappointment at Slovakia's
decision, but any censure is unlikely to go much beyond that.
Slovakia appears to realise as much. Finance Minister Ivan
Miklos said on Thursday he was surprised Brussels was upset by a
decision he had flagged to finance ministers weeks ago.
 ""I spent 2-1/2 hours at the Eurogroup debating the Slovak
position on Greece,"" he told reporters in Bratislava. ""It was
not an easy debate but I pointed out clearly our stance and the
reasons behind the position.""
 Asked if he expected consequences for Slovakia, which joined
the euro last year, Miklos said: ""In terms of a possible
reaction, I cannot image that rules, set by agreements, are
being violated. This happens in the European Union from time to
time.""
 A senior EU official with knowledge of Slovakia's situation
said EU ministers had not told the country directly that it
could face consequences if it did not back the Greek bailout,
even if an element of censure was intended ""between the lines"".
 
 CALCULATED MOVE?
 With three weeks to go before EU finance ministers next
meet, and Greece unaffected by the lack of Slovak participation,
the issue may be sidelined by early September.
 EU leaders are aware that Slovakia, which remains firmly
pro-European, has to take account of domestic pressures. They
will want above all to display euro zone unity.
 ""The Slovak move derives from highly unique Slovak political
conditions,"" said Jon Levy, the director of Europe research at
Eurasia Group, a political analysis consultancy.
 ""A scan of the 15 other members of the euro zone reveals no
similar political arrangement, and thus this move should be
considered in a domestic Slovakian context, not as a signal of
broader fissures in political will.""
 Still, Slovak Prime Minister Iveta Radicova said on Thursday
her country had merely said aloud what many thought quietly, and
Germany said it was concerned that others might follow suit.
 ""Yes, we were the only ones who said 'No' loudly. But I'm
certain that this 'No' is in the minds of representatives from
all EU countries,"" Radicova told FT Deutschland newspaper,
saying Slovakia had got no help when it was in difficulty.
 ""What should I tell our citizens, that we should help those
who aren't willing to help themselves?""
 Germany, the EU's biggest economy and main contributor to
both the Greek bailout and the broader backstop fund, said it
was worried Slovakia was removing a brick from euro zone unity.
 ""Just as we welcome the decision to participate in the EFSF,
we regret the decision on Greece,"" a German Finance Ministry
official said. ""Especially since it reneges on a political
agreement reached by the previous government.""
 However, with no other euro zone states even hinting at
imitating Slovakia's move, it is extremely unlikely the Greek
bailout could unravel. EU ministers know it is more a case of
insisting that member states show greater unity.
 ""There is nothing one can do about it,"" one official said.
""But if everybody starts reneging on agreements of previous
governments, it's hard to see how this whole thing (the EU) is
going to work.""

 NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on
Thursday, extending the previous day's strong gains, due to
risk aversion fueled by an unexpected rise in U.S. weekly

 After the Greek data, the cost of protecting Greek
government debt against default rose, with five-year credit

 ""I don't think that we need to see another strong risk

 Investors will focus on whether the euro would fall below
$1.2790, roughly the low hit on July 23, when the results of

 By Corbett B. Daly
 WASHINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers
filing new claims for unemployment insurance unexpectedly rose
to its highest level in close to six months, a fresh signal of
a weak jobs market.
 The number of new claims for jobless benefits rose 2,000 to
484,000 in the week ended August 7, the second straight
increase, Labor Department data showed on Thursday.
 ""This is not a good number,"" said John Brady, an analyst
at MF Global in Chicago. ""Claims are going the wrong way. That
has the market concerned.""
 The data comes two days after the Federal Reserve
downgraded its assessment of the economy's health and said it
would take steps to ensure its support for the fragile economic
recovery does not wane.
 U.S. stock index futures added to losses, while U.S
Treasury debt prices pared losses following the data.
 The jobless claims data is the latest in a series of
releases which indicate the pace of the economic recovery is
slowing.
 Economists have been ratcheting down estimates for
second-quarter economic growth after data on trade and
inventories for June suggested it was not as strong as earlier
thought.
 The government estimated last month the economy advanced at
a 2.4 percent annualized pace in the April-June quarter, far
more slowly than the 3.7 percent pace of the first quarter, and
now some economists believe the economy may have grown at less
than half that rate.
 The Labor Department said separately that higher oil prices
pushed prices for imported goods higher in July for the first
time in three months, though at half the pace economists had
expected.
 Import prices rose 0.2 percent in July after falling 1.3
percent in June and a revised 0.8 percent in May. That left the
three-month cumulative total down 2.0 percent, the largest
decline since the three months ended February 2009.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected import
prices to rise 0.4 percent in July.
 The four-week moving average of unemployment claims, which
economists prefer because it smoothes out weekly fluctuations,
rose 14,250 to 473,500, also the highest level since the week
ended February 20.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected claims in the
latest week to fall to 465,000 from the previously reported
479,000.
 The number of people still collecting unemployment
benefits after an initial week of aid in the week ended July 31
fell 118,000 to 4.45 million, the lowest level since late June.
Economists had expected 4.53 million. The four-week moving
average of continuing claims fell 64,500 to 4.52 million, the
lowest level since December 2008.
 Prices for exported goods unexpectedly fell 0.2 percent in
July after falling a revised 0.7 percent in the prior month.
The Reuters poll showed economists expecting a 0.1 percent
increase in July.
 Oil import prices rose 2.0 percent last month after
falling for two months while prices excluding oil fell 0.2
percent.

 ISTANBUL/KIRKUK, Iraq, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Iraq resumed
exporting oil to Turkey through the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline on
Thursday, two days after a bomb attack knocked out flows on the
key energy corridor, officials said.
 Oil flow was restored to 350,000-400,000 barrels per day,
the same rate as before the bombing, said an official with
Iraq's North Oil Company in Kirkuk.
 ""Iraq started from the first hours of today exporting

before the attack. No problems at all at the current time.""
 The Kirkuk-Ceyhan link carries an average of 500,000 barrels
of oil a day, or about a quarter of Iraq's total exports.
 Turkey blamed the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) for
the bombing, which started a major fire and killed two people.
Turkish Energy Ministry officials said Turkey planned to
increase security along the route to prevent further sabotage.
 ""The fire was extinguished, then cooling activities took
place. Now maintenance work is being carried out,"" said a
spokeswoman at Botas, Turkey's state-run pipeline operator.
 Authorities have re-routed the flow of oil from the larger
pipe that was bombed to a smaller one that runs parallel while
repairs on the damaged pipe continue, she said. Pumping began
early on Thursday, the spokeswoman also said.
 Energy Minister Taner Yildiz told reporters in Ankara that
repairs to the larger pipe could take six to seven days.
 Two shipping agents earlier said the flow of oil had resumed
late on Wednesday.
 One agent based near Ceyhan, who spoke on condition he would
not be identified, said the rate of pumping was between 4,000
and 4,600 cubic metres. At least one tanker was waiting to load
cargo at Ceyhan after being delayed by the pipeline's outage, he
said.
 The 960 kilometre Kirkuk-Ceyhan link consists of two
parallel pipelines. Different pumping stations along the route
allow pipeline operators to switch the flow of crude to the
other line, Iraqi oil-industry sources have said.
 The PKK, which has waged a 26-year insurgency against the
Turkish state, last month claimed responsibility for bombing
Kirkuk-Ceyhan in an attack that stopped flows for several days.
 The conflict between the PKK and Turkish military, which
began in August 1984 as a campaign for an independent Kurdish
homeland, has claimed more than 40,000 lives, mostly Kurdish.

823,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2010 08:56AM ET</span>",EU to investigate U.S. biodiesel tariff evasion," * Since tariffs, US down while Canada, Singapore exports up
 * Also alleged switch to low-level blends to avoid tax
 
 BRUSSELS, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The European Union is
investigating whether U.S. biodiesel exporters have been
shipping to Europe via third countries to avoid high tariffs
imposed last year, the EU executive said on Thursday.
 The European Commission said it was also studying whether
U.S. exporters were switching to diesel blends containing less
than 20 percent biofuel to avoid tariffs that apply to blends
containing 20 percent or more.
 European biodiesel producers requested the probe in June,
saying U.S. trans-shipments via Canada and Singapore and a
switch to low-level blends were flooding the EU with cheap
imports and squeezing domestic producers out of business.
 The EU imposed tariffs totalling more than 400 euros per
tonne on U.S.-made biodiesel last year after ruling that it was
illegally subsidised and that exporters were dumping it on the
EU market.
 Since then, U.S. exports to the EU have plummeted while
Canadian sales to the EU have soared to more than 140,000 tonnes
in 2009, from about 1,700 tonnes in 2008, according to EU data.
Exports from Singapore rose to more than 20,000 tonnes in 2009
from 177 tonnes the year before.
 ""This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from
the trans-shipment of biodiesel originating in the United States
of America via Canada and Singapore,"" the EU said in its
official register.
 ""Sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an
investigation,"" it said.
 The EU's Anti Fraud Office said it had started a parallel
probe.
 If European authorities can prove illegal trans-shipments,
Canadian and Singaporean exporters would face the same penalties
as those imposed on U.S. exporters.
 The decision to launch the investigation highlights the
battle to clinch a slice of a renewable energy market that is
growing amid global efforts to fight climate change.
 The secretary-general of the European Biodiesel Board,
Raffaello Garofalo, said it was urging EU authorities to extend
the scope of established trade measures to make up for the
damage caused to European producers.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week low
against the dollar on Thursday after weak Greek data highlighted
the problems facing some euro zone economies, while the yen
pared losses on easing fears of immediate action to stem the
yen's rise.
 The euro reversed earlier gains versus the dollar after
Greek gross domestic product figures came in below forecast and
unemployment jumped, which analysts said brought Greece's
long-term solvency issues to the fore again.
 Underlining such concerns, the cost of protecting Greek
government debt against default rose, with five-year credit
default swaps widening around 30 basis points to 795 basis
points after the data.
 ""The Greek data reinforces concerns that the Greek
authorities may back away from austerity measures and move
towards haircuts or even sovereign default,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 By 1111 GMT, the euro traded slightly lower on the day at
$1.2821 after hitting a session trough of $1.2800, according to
Reuters data. It retreated from the day's high of $1.2932, and
was testing the 100-day moving average at $1.2807.
 The euro extended its losses after tumbling 2.6 percent on
Wednesday, its biggest one-day loss since October 2008.
 ""The euro sell-off we've seen this week has been down to
concerns about the peripheral euro zone economies,"" said Jane
Foley, research director at Forex.com. 
 Market participants said the euro was supported around
$1.2800 and that the focus was on whether the single currency
would fall below $1.2790, roughly the low hit on July 23, when
the results of the European bank stress tests were announced.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent versus a currency basket to
82.679, its highest since late July. It extended gains made on
Wednesday, when concerns about the U.S. and global economies
triggered a wave of unwinding of short dollar positions.
 INTERVENTION FEARS EASE
 The dollar was 0.2 percent higher versus the yen at 85.35
yen after rising as high as 85.82 in early trade. It stayed
close to a 15-year low hit on Wednesday at 84.72, in a move
driven largely by a narrowing spread between U.S. and Japanese
government bond yields.
 The dollar had bounced against the yen in early trade, aided
by market sources telling Reuters the Bank of Japan checked
exchange rates with banks earlier on Thursday..
 But it pulled away from the day' high after Japanese Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda later reiterated the government's
position that it is closely watching currency movements and that
disorderly moves would hurt the economy.
 ""The market is somewhat disappointed that nothing
significant came out of the Noda press conference on the policy
front. His comments were largely neutral,"" Hardman said.
 Noda's comments came after Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
was quoted as saying yen moves have been 'rough', and some
analysts said this suggested Japanese authorities may be
stepping up efforts to reign in yen strength.
 ""The prime minister is saying that currency movements are
'rough' and there have been discussions on currencies between
the BOJ and the Finance Ministry, so you could say they've taken
the next step towards intervention,"" said Lutz Karpowitz,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""If you look at the frequency of statements, you can clearly
see that the efforts of verbal intervention are clearly higher
than a week ago.""
 Still, he added that the dollar's latest slide against the
yen has been a controlled one, and analysts say Japanese
authorities may have difficulty justifying an orderly decline in
the dollar against the yen.

 * National airline says struggles to import spare parts 
 * Government says restrictions are to protect domestic firms
 
 By Lamine Chikhi
 ALGIERS, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Aziouz, an Algerian businessman,
pays people to smuggle merchandise into the north African
country hidden in their suitcases.
 He is not a drug trafficker -- just an ordinary shopkeeper
trying to keep shelves in his store stocked in the face of tough
new restrictions on imports imposed by the government.
 ""French cheeses, chocolate, coffee and perfumes are at the
top of my list,"" said Aziouz, who did not want his full name
published because what he is doing is illegal. ""I prefer to pay
air travellers to bring me what I need in their luggage.""
 Since the restrictions were introduced last year -- part of
a trend towards economic nationalism that has also seen foreign
investors targeted -- they have been the focus of mounting anger
in Algeria's business community.
 That reached a peak last month when the national airline
said some of its planes had been grounded because restrictions
made it hard to import spare parts.
 The unhappiness could present a challenge for Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has spearheaded the policy
of economic nationalism.
 ""(The restriction on imports) is not a popular decision,""
said Hafid Sualili, an economics commentator with Algeria's El
Khabar newspaper.
 ""It's not a good decision for Bouteflika's nationalist
economic policy. It will give credibility to supporters of an
open economy.""
 The government says it imposed import restrictions to
protect domestic producers. It says they cannot compete with
poor-quality foreign goods dumped on the Algerian market by
unscrupulous businesspeople.
 The tough stance on imports and foreign investment has so
far been popular with large numbers of Algerians, who look with
nostalgia to the country's Socialist past.
 Many people in Algeria applauded when one of the biggest
foreign investors, Egypt's Orascom Telecom , was hit
with hefty tax demands. It is now negotiating the sale of its
lucrative Algerian unit to the state.
 However, some observers believe import restrictions could
turn the tide of opinion, especially if they start causing
inconvenience for ordinary Algerians.
 
 LETTER OF CREDIT
 The focus of the business community's complaints is a
regulation stating that before they can bring goods worth over
1,500 euros ($1,900) into the country, importers must obtain a
letter of credit from a bank to cover the value of the goods.
 Until the rule was introduced, it was usual for suppliers to
ship the goods on trust, with the bill settled later.
 Imports are a sensitive issue for Algeria, which is the
world's eighth biggest exporter of crude oil but has little
manufacturing industry, forcing it to import most of what its 35
million people consume.
 The new measure creates the biggest headaches for small
entrepreneurs, like the shopkeeper with a sideline in smuggling,
who lack the cashflow to obtain a letter of credit or the
resources to negotiate all the red tape involved.
 But the measure has also caused difficulties for law-abiding
large-scale businesses.
 One importer said Algerian banks were so overloaded by the
volume of letters of credit they were having to deal with that
the process sometimes took up to 14 days. Outside Algeria, it
usually takes between two and five hours.
 Those delays -- added to the existing problems of congested
ports and slow customs bureaucracy -- frequently resulted in
ships waiting for days because they were unable to unload.
 ""It costs me $45,000 a day for the ship and the demurrage,""
said the importer, using the term for fees which have to be paid
to a ship's owner when it is delayed unloading.
 ""I think in the past year I've probably paid $2 million in
demurrage and other fees ... It's been getting worse,"" said the
importer, who did not want to be identified.
 In the clearest sign yet of the mounting unhappiness, the
head of the state-owned national airline said flight delays over
the busy summer season were caused, in part, by planes stranded
on the tarmac without any replacement parts.
 The new import arrangements are a ""real catastrophe,"" local
newspapers quoted Air Algerie chief executive Abdelwahid
Bouabdallah as saying.
 A shipping industry executive said he could not understand
how the imports system could continue functioning. ""Surely
they'll reach a point when the shops become empty?"" he said.
 There is already anecdotal evidence that the supply chain is
under strain. A computer supplier said it did not have one model
in stock because a consignment was stuck in customs. A furniture
store said its summer collection was also held up.
 Some imported food items can suddenly disappear from the
shelves of convenience stories, and then re-appear weeks later.
 There is so far no direct evidence that the restrictions are
pushing up prices. Inflation jumped last year, but this was
driven by rises in the price of food produced inside Algeria.
Official figures in June put annual inflation at 5.4 percent.
 Nevertheless, the government has been sufficiently worried
by price rises to draft a law imposing caps on the price of some
consumer products. [ID:nLDE65T2BN]
 Ministers have hinted they may ease some minor aspects of
the import restrictions, in particular to streamline imports of
essential spare parts, according to local newspapers.
 That is little comfort to software importer Reda Shouikh,
who said he had been forced to suspend his business activities
because of the restrictions.
 ""My belief is that a country which produces nothing cannot
survive if it stops imports,"" he said.

 * Fifteen ships held up by customs
 
(Adds ship held up by customs, quotes, details)
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian government is
considering limiting combined exports of wheat and barley in the
2010/11 season, while the Customs Service has already blocked
shipments from ports, traders' union UZA said on Thursday.
 Ukraine, the world's largest exporter of barley and
sixth-largest of wheat, is due to make a final decision on
export quotas Aug. 18 after severe winter frosts and a scorching
summer heat wave ruined tracts of its crops.
 ""According to the information we have, the government plans
to introduce a quota on wheat and barley,"" Volodymyr Klymenko,
the head of UZA union, told a news conference.
 ""We have heard about the figure of 5 million tonnes for
wheat plus barley.""
 Klymenko estimated that Ukraine could end up with enough
stocks for exports of around double that amount this season, or
5 million tonnes of wheat and barley each. In the 2009/10
season, which runs from July to June, Ukraine exported 9.2
million tonnes of wheat and 6.2 million of barley.
 He said exports of maize were likely to be free this season.
Ukraine exported 5.3 million tonnes of maize in 2009/10.
 The government, which last month said that there was no
ground to limit exports, this week raised concerns over bread
shortages after the farm ministry cut the 2010 wheat crop
forecast to 17 million tonnes from 20.9 million in 2009.
 
 15 SHIPS HELD AT PORT
 Traders have complained that the customs services virtually
halted exports from Ukraine this month after a surge in domestic
grain prices risked triggering rises in bread price.
 On Thursday the Customs Service said it had prevented export
of 28,500 tonnes of wheat because of incorrect paperwork.
 ""Ukrainian grain traders gave the customs (service) export
documents that contained wrong information,"" the customs service
said in a statement.
 Most of the cargo was on one vessel, though the customs
action also involved a smaller cargo on a second ship. It was
not clear what the destination of the grain had been.
 Klymenko said at least 15 grain vessels were in Black Sea
ports awaiting permission to leave.
 ""There are about 15 ships in ports, and it is unclear
whether they will leave Ukraine or not,"" Klymenko said.
 Klymenko said traders needed a clear decision by the
government because more than 1 million tonnes of grain were in
ports' silos or going to ports by railroad.
 In July Ukraine exported 764,103 tonnes of grain, including
224,630 tonnes of wheat and 414,372 of barley, far below the
level of July 2009 at 1.684 million tonnes, including 626,744
tonnes of wheat and 704,943 of barley.
 Ukraine traditionally exports barley in the first months of
the season.
 In 2009/10 Ukraine sold abroad a total of 21.5 million
tonnes of grain compared to 25 million in 2008/09.

 By Denis Dyomkin
 TAGANROG, Russia, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Drought has destroyed a
quarter of Russia's grain crop this year, President Dmitry
Medvedev said on Thursday, pushing some farmers to the brink of
bankruptcy and hurting Russia's bid to expand food exports.
 The disaster has led Russia to ban grain exports from
Sunday, could shave one percentage point off growth in Russia's
$1.3 trillion economy and stoke inflation as worried Russians
stock up on food.
 But Medvedev said the export restrictions, designed to
restrain domestic food prices, could be lifted before their Dec.
31 expiry, if the harvest permitted. That contradicted Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin assertion this week said that the ban
could be extended into 2011.
 The export ban could allow the United States to take market
share from the world's third largest exporter, threatening
Russia's long-term ambition to diversify its economy from oil
and win a bigger share on the global agricultural market.
 ""The situation in many regions is extreme... Unfortunately,
many farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy because of crop
losses,"" Medvedev told farmers and grains traders in southern
Russia.
 ""Grain has been lost on one quarter of the sown area,""
Medvedev said. The area sown for this year's grain crop is
officially estimated at 43.6 million hectares.
 The drought, triggered by Russia's worst heatwave since
records began, has also caused huge forest fires, although the
Kremlin chief cancelled a state of emergency in three out of
seven regions affected by the devastating by the blazes.
 The authorities have appeared ill-prepared to tackle the
fires, which have killed at least 54 people, and slow to react
to the choking smog which has blanketed the capital Moscow.
 But political analysts say voters -- who mostly gain their
news from tightly controlled mass media -- were likely to blame
local officials for the crisis rather than Russia's paramount
leaders.
 In neighbouring Ukraine, customs officials banned a wheat
export cargo citing incorrect paperwork while Ukraine's traders
union said the government was considering an export quota of 5
million tonnes for wheat and barley.
 Chicago wheat futures rose around half a percent on Thursday
to near $7 a bushel, while corn and soybeans were little changed
ahead of a key U.S. government report on world demand and supply
of grains.
 
 NOTHING LEFT TO EXPORT?
 Agriculture Ministry data showed that Russia -- which
exported around 22 million tonnes in 2009/10 -- may have no more
grain to ship abroad in the current crop year, which started on
July 1, even if it lifts export bans from 2011.
 ""With a crop of 60-65 million tonnes exports may be 2.0-4.5
million tonnes,"" the ministry said in a presentation.
 Of the export total, 1.6 million tonnes has already been
shipped in July, while up to another 1.2 million tonnes may have
left the country in the first two weeks of this month, before
the ban kicks in on Aug. 15.
 Medvedev said the government would ""see if we can reopen
(exports) earlier"". That may prove optimistic and prospects for
2011/2 crop year may also be hurt.
 Weather forecasts for the next four to five days may favour
the eruption of new fires but temperatures will cool gradually
from Aug. 17, Roman Vilfand, head of the state weather service
told a news conference on Thursday.
 Insufficient rain will delay winter sowing in the European
part of Russia until at least next month, he added.
 Winter sowings -- which account roughly for 40 percent of
Russia's total grain output -- will be discussed at a special
meeting of the government commission on drought on Friday.
 Farmers could partially compensate by sowing more in the
spring, but analysts say the drought will leave them with a
shortage of seeds to plant next year.
 
 U.S. THREAT
 To the dismay of some Russian growers, Russia's
drought-reduced wheat crop will allow the United States the
chance to sell some of its mounting surplus, U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Tom Vilsack said on Wednesday.
 ""There is no question this is an opportunity for us and
we're going to take advantage of it,"" said Vilsack. ""Tomorrow
will give us an indication of what our capacities are,"" he said,
referring to the U.S. Agriculture Department's monthly report.
 ""The whole of America is talking -- farmers will take
advantage of the situation, will start driving Lamborghinis,""
Viktor Borodayev, the head of an agriculture firm in the Rostov
region, complained to Medvedev at the meeting.
 Medvedev declined to comment on the issue, though
Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik downplayed the threat.
 ""A market is a market ... What should I do? We will see from
the results of the harvest -- may be we will regain our
positions,"" she told Reuters after the meeting.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The yen's surge to a 15-year peak
against the dollar this week comes amid mounting worries that
the U.S. economic recovery is losing steam and follows a broad,
two-month slide in the dollar. [ID:nSGE67B08O]
 A drop in U.S. Treasury yields, a perception among market
players that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be more willing to
conduct aggressive monetary easing than the Bank of Japan, and
talk of seasonal fund repatriation by Japanese investors have
all contributed recently to the yen's rise.
 Over the course of the year, there has been a steady trickle
of overseas investment by Japanese institutional and retail
investors, and the yen has gained less against currencies other
than the dollar in the past few months.
 So why has the yen been so strong against the dollar in
particular, despite unappealingly low domestic interest rates
and long-term concerns about Japan's ageing population and huge
mountain of public debt? 
 
 JAPANESE INVESTORS
 The yen's rise seems counter-intuitive, especially in view
of the fact that Japanese investors, particularly households,
have been steadily investing abroad in 2010.
 In fact, net buying of overseas equities, bonds and money
market instruments by Japanese investment trusts from January to
July has risen 65 percent from the same period last year to 2.8
trillion yen ($32.9 billion).
 But analysts say such overseas investment by Japanese mutual
funds, or ""toushin"" funds, seemed to be headed increasingly
towards higher-yielding currencies rather than the dollar,
suggesting that such capital outflows have not provided much
support to the U.S. unit.
 ""Most of the investment trusts that have been launched
recently have been focused on the (Brazilian) real, and do not
have a direct impact on the dollar against the yen,"" said
Daisuke Karakama, market economist for Mizuho Corporate Bank's
forex division.
 Among institutional investors, life insurers have increased
their foreign securities investment, albeit much more slightly,
to 1.2 trillion yen from 1.1 trillion yen in January-July 2009.
 But since the cost of hedging against foreign exchange risk
is now relatively cheap, life insurers are likely gravitating
more to currency-hedged investment, meaning the net impact on
currencies is probably smaller than such numbers would suggest,
analysts say.
 
 OVERSEAS INVESTORS
 One factor helping to offset the impact of such capital
outflows from Japan is overseas buying of Japanese assets,
especially short-term money market instruments, market players
say.
 Overseas investors bought a net 5.5 trillion yen in Japanese
equities, bonds and money market instruments combined from
January to July, Ministry of Finance data shows.
 The bulk of overseas buying of Japanese assets this year has
been in short-term money market instruments, as seen most
clearly in China's record buying spree of Japanese debt.
[ID:nTOE67802Z] [ID:nTOE66705G]
 In the first six months of 2010, total Chinese net buying of
Japanese short- and longer-term debt combined came to more than
1.7 trillion yen, far outstripping the record 255.7 billion yen
it bought in 2005.
 Market players say that such overseas demand for short-term
Japanese debt, either as part of foreign reserves
diversification or due to investors seeking a temporary parking
place for their money, has likely helped support the yen.

 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production
declined in June, with output in France and Germany falling
sharply, but a strong showing over the second quarter as a whole
suggests Friday's GDP data for the bloc will be robust.
 Output fell 0.1 percent month-on-month, figures released by
Eurostat on Thursday showed, and rose 8.2 percent year-on-year,
although the drop followed sharp increases in April and May.
 After a string of upbeat economic data from the 16 countries
that share the euro single currency in recent weeks, the output
figures indicate momentum may have faltered late last quarter
although the data are volatile and forward-looking reports for
the third quarter have so far been positive.
 The European Central Bank said on Thursday the euro zone
economy strengthened in the second quarter and third quarter
data so far had been better than expected. [ID:nLDE65F1M9]
 But with signs of U.S. growth stalling, and indications that
China, the world's second largest economy, may also have pulled
back from the peak of its expansion, the euro zone growth
outlook in the months ahead could be dampened.
 ""We would expect production to weaken in the future,"" said
Ken Wattret, chief euro zone economist at BNP Paribas. ""We are
seeing evidence that the U.S. economy and China are losing
momentum. Europe will suffer from that over the next 6 months.""
 A flash estimate of euro zone gross domestic product for the
second quarter is to be released on Friday. Economists polled by
Reuters expect a solid 0.7 percent quarter-on-quarter gain,
following anaemic 0.2 percent growth in the first quarter.
 Offsetting some of June's disappointment was an upward
revision to earlier data, with Eurostat saying industry output
rose 1.1 percent in May, for a 9.9 percent year-on-year gain,
following a solid 0.8 percent increase in April.
 ""I was looking for a further increase in June but we've seen
in recent months that it's a volatile series,"" Citigroup
economist Juergen Michels said of the industry figures.
 ""But I would not exaggerate this reading and given the
strong backing from orders, I expect further gains in production
in the coming months.""

 CONSUMER KEY
 While the euro zone has produced a stream of encouraging
data on inflation and consumer and business sentiment, there is
yet to be a clear flow-through to consumer demand, which will be
the major driver of any sustained upturn in economic growth.
 With euro zone unemployment holding steady at 10 percent --
a 12-year high -- and many economies in the region looking to
cut public-sector pay as part of a wide-ranging austerity drive,
consumer demand is likely to remain restrained, or at least lead
to a two-speed recovery in the bloc.
 The industrial production figures were pulled down by a poor
performance in Germany and France, the euro zone's two biggest
economies, with German output declining 0.5 percent during the
month and France's production down 1.6 percent.

but does not have specific levels in mind when it watches the

839,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2010 05:12AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Ukraine customs block export of wheat cargo," * Export of 28,500 tonnes prevented due incorrect paperwork
 * Most of the grain on one ship, some on a second
 * Ukraine may decide next week to impose export quotas

 KIEV, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Customs officials in Ukraine, which
is considering introducing a quota system for grain exports,
said on Thursday they had prevented export of 28,500 tonnes of
wheat because of incorrect paperwork.
 ""Ukrainian grain traders gave the customs export documents,
which contained wrong information,"" the customs service said in
a statement.
 Most of the cargo was on one vessel, though the customs
action also involved a smaller cargo on a second ship. It was
not clear what the destination of the grain had been.
 Traders said the move, one of several such reported
recently, underscored high-level nervousness about the state of
Ukraine's grain market following adverse weather conditions that
will hit the 2010 harvest, and the impact of a grain exports ban
by big neighbour Russia.
 After several days of indecisiveness by the government,
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said on Wednesday that
Ukraine was likely to make a decision next week to impose grain
export quotas.
 The customs service in Ukraine, the world's No. 1 barley
exporter and sixth-placed exporter of wheat, now appear to be
using new rules introduced late last month to block some export
cargoes, analysts and traders have said.
 A trade source told Reuters on Wednesday that customs
officials had detained several cargo ships carrying grain
belonging to five traders. Grain quality was the reason given.
 ""About a quarter of a total of 140,000 tonnes of grain,
which have already been loaded on to vessels for future exports,
appeared to have the wrong data,"" the customs said in its
statement on Thursday.
 Ukraine could harvest 40-42 million tonnes of grain this
year -- 13 percent down on its 2009 yield, but it needs 26
million tonnes of grain for its domestic needs.
 The customs service says its aim is to prevent fraudulent
export transactions but analysts question this.
 ""The timing of these developments, and especially,
controlling grain exports, casts doubt on such a rationale by
government officials, and raises questions regarding a true
motive,"" brokerage Investment Capital Ukraine said in a note
this week.
 ""The Ukrainian government is apparently at a crossroads in
deciding how to fine-tune its policymaking, given the current
conditions on the grain market and the quite likely spill-over
effect of higher soft commodities prices on grains into consumer
prices for food.""

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko
Noda said on Thursday the government is sharing information on
currencies with officials in the United States and other
countries after the yen jumped to a 15-year high versus the
dollar.
 Group of Seven finance ministers have no plans to hold a
conference call about turbulence in currency markets, Noda told
reporters.
 Noda declined to comment on currency intervention, instead
saying that the government will deal appropriately with the
economic situation.
 The dollar erased gains against the yen after Noda's
comments, suggesting some traders had been braced for stronger
rhetoric as Japanese policymakers fret that yen gains could hurt
the economy.
 The greenback rebounded earlier after Prime Minister Naoto
Kan was quoted as saying the yen's recent rise is ""rough.""
 The greenback skidded to a 15-year low of 84.72 yen on
trading platform EBS on Wednesday as weakness in the U.S. economy
prompted the Federal Reserve to say it would buy more government
debt and raised fears that the global economy is slowing.
 Asked if foreign exchange market intervention was one option,
Noda told reporters: ""I'll refrain from commenting.""
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Thursday
that currency and stock markets were fluctuating sharply.
 ""Currency and stock markets are showing big fluctuations
against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty about the U.S.
economic outlook,"" Shirakawa said in a statement.
 Japan's authorities haven't intervened in the currency
markets since March 2004, when a 15-month yen selling spree came
to an end. During that period, they sold 35 trillion yen ($410.7
billion) to try to stop a rising yen from harming all-important
exports and to fight deflation.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2010 04:52AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-What comes next in S.African state workers' strike?," By Peroshni Govender
 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 6 (Reuters) - South African public sector
workers suspended a pay strike on Monday as it entered its
fourth week, union officials said.
 The strike by teachers, health workers, police, customs
officials and clerks is the public sector's worst since 2007 and
has put President Jacob Zuma at odds with his biggest backers.
 Strikers have demanded a 8.6 percent pay rise -- twice the
rate of inflation -- and a 1,000 rand ($135) a month housing
allowance. The government raised its offer to 7.5 percent and
800 rand for housing last week but workers rejected it and
unions asked for more time to explain it to their members.
 The following scenarios may emerge:

 STRIKERS RETURN TO WORK BY MIDWEEK
 * It is most likely that workers will only return to their
posts midweek. Economists estimate the strike is costing
Africa's biggest economy about a billion rand a day.
 
 GOVERNMENT STICKS TO OFFER AND SEEKS UNION LEADERS' HELP
 * The government appears not to have much more room in its
budget to improve its current offer.
 * Union leaders seem to understand there is no more money in
the pot. The unions said they had 21 days to finalise
discussions with their members on a draft agreement.
 * Zuma last week ordered ministers to negotiate a deal to
end labour stalemate.
 * Unions need to do a lot to convince members to accept a
deal. But under the government's ""no work, no pay"" policy, most
strikers would lose more from being off the job then they will
win in salary gains over the next two years.
 
 UNION MEMBERS REJECT OFFER AGAIN
 * The government could be forced to increase its offer,
digging itself deeper into a deficit hole.
 * The largest labour federation COSATU may try to force the
government's hand by renewing its threat that nearly 2 million
members in affiliated unions could stage sympathy strikes.
 * A long strike by all COSATU members, who include factory
workers and miners, would deal a heavy blow to the economy.
 
 FUTURE BUDGET WOES
 * The government has a yawning budget deficit and its wage
bill is already a third of total spending. Any deal would add
about 1 to 2 percent to state spending.
 * State borrowing could rise, worrying ratings agencies and
making it more costly to issue new debt.
 * The real damage to the economy will be difficult to
measure and will come from lost productivity.
 
 ALLIANCE PROBLEMS
 * COSATU said, before Zuma intervened, that its longstanding
governing alliance with the ANC was near rupture. It could drop
the conciliatory tone it has taken since and try to undermine
him at a mid-term ANC policy-setting meeting this month.
 * But analysts said COSATU risks pushing too hard, with Zuma
being perhaps its best available ally, and could lose support
for its left-leaning policies.
 * If Zuma wants another term in office, he may make another
increased wage offer and worry about the budget later.
 * But he may try to broaden his support in the splintered
ANC and listen to appeals from an anti-union faction which had
opposed him but see this as an opportune time to attack labour.
 This could lead him to adopt policies opposed by organised
labour that would add flexibility to the country's rigid job
market. The move would probably be hailed by economists and
could help reduce unemployment.

 * European shares up, Wall Street outlook mixed
 * Euro weakness boosts dollar
 * Oil falls for third session on economy fears
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Financial markets regained some
composure on Thursday after the previous session's broad selloff
of riskier assets, with European shares inching up but the euro
hurt by new worries about some of its weaker member economies.
 Wall Street looked set for a mixed start, with buying
interest mainly on blue chips stocks.
 Asian stock markets, catching up with Wednesday's moves in
the West, slid to a near three-week low.
 The resulting mix took world stocks as measured by MSCI and
Thomson Reuters down roughly 0.3 percent, compared with
Wednesday's loss of around 2.8 percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300, however, was up half a
percent. This came despite weaker-than-expected Greek growth
figures and unemployment data that posted a record jump,
reinforcing concerns over peripheral euro zone economies.
 Wednesday's sell-off was prompted by growing doubts about
global economic growth. The U.S. economy, in particular, is
showing signs of stumbling, prompting the U.S. Federal Reserve
to take steps to hold down borrowing costs.
 A spate of data from China has also confirmed its rapid
imports and factory output growth to be slowing.
 ""We could see economies relapse and double dip or struggle
through and begin to grow with private demand starting to carry
their weight,"" said Peter Elston, strategist at Aberdeen Asset
Management in Singapore.
 ""It is very unclear which of those two we are going to get.""
 Global economic worries also preyed on the oil market, where
crude slid for a third day.
 U.S. crude for September delivery fell 82 cents or more than
1 percent to $77.20 a barrel, extending its decline following a
3 percent fall on Wednesday, its biggest drop in six weeks.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei closed down nearly 0.9 percent.
 
 EURO LIFTS DOLLAR
 The dollar recovered earlier losses to gain a third of a
percent versus a basket of currencies, mainly as a result of
euro weakness. The U.S. currency posted its biggest one-day gain
in two years on Wednesday.
 The euro was trading flat to lower versus the dollar at
$1.2829 after the Greek data. It had fallen more than 2 percent
on Wednesday on a widening in euro zone peripheral spreads and a
broad strengthening in the dollar.
 German government bonds were also flat to lower.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The euro bounced on Thursday, as
heavy selling abated on early signs euro zone peripheral spreads
were stabilising, while speculation of intervention to weaken
the yen drove down the Japanese currency.
 The dollar steadied versus a basket of currencies after
posting its biggest one-day gain in two years the previous day
when concerns about the U.S. and global economies triggered a
wave of unwinding in short dollar positions.
 ""The euro sell-off we've seen this week has been down to
concerns about the peripheral euro zone economies, but I think
that move is temporary and the strength of the recovery in
Germany is more important for the euro,"" said Jane Foley,
research director at Forex.com.
 The premium that investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
bonds over German bunds had widened this week on worries over
the Irish economy, but traders said Irish spreads were
stabilising early on Thursday.
 Robust German data has been underpinning the euro recently,
with next attention centred on release of GDP data for Germany
on Friday.
 At 0745 GMT, the euro was trading up around 0.6 percent
versus the dollar at $1.2915. It had fallen more than 2 percent
on Wednesday on a widening in euro zone peripheral spreads and a
broad strengthening in the dollar.
 Traders noted the euro had steadied ahead of support at its
100-day moving average, coming in at $1.2807.
 
 DOLLAR/YEN RECOVERY
 The greenback rose to 85.80 yen from a 15-year trough
against the yen marked the day before, aided by market sources
telling Reuters the Bank of Japan checked exchange rates with
banks earlier on Thursday.
 ""The talk of the BOJ rate checking prompted players to cover
short dollar positions, although bearish sentiment persists for
the dollar,"" said an FX trader at a big Japanese brokerage.
 Traders noted a large option expiring at 85.00 yen later,
which they said could limit movement on the day.
 The U.S. currency fell as low as 84.72 yen on trading
platform EBS on Wednesday, when it took out option barriers
around 85.00 yen and a November low of 84.82 yen. The currency's
slide was fuelled by a narrowing spread between U.S. and
Japanese government bond yields.
 Two-year Treasury yields fell to a fresh all-time low on
Wednesday a day after the Federal Reserve announced a plan to
reinvest the money from maturing mortgage bonds in government
debt to help its economy.
 The move prompted speculation that Japanese authorities may
intervene to weaken the yen, but analysts were sceptical.
 ""Movements in currencies are too far removed from Japanese
fundamentals to justify intervention. It's more about Federal
Reserve policy,"" said Forex.com's Foley.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda was due to hold a
press conference at 0830 GMT but a euro zone official told
Reuters on Wednesday that European authorities would not welcome
intervention by Japan and joint intervention by major central
banks was not on the cards.
 The dollar traded up around 0.5 percent at 85.70 yen. The
euro traded up over 1 percent against the yen at 110.72 yen
after falling to 109.20 in Asia.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against six major currencies, was down 0.1 percent on the day at
82.147, but well above its 200-day moving average, now at
80.898.

 By Denis Dyomkin
 TAGANROG, Russia, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Drought-hit Russia may
export no more than 4.5 million tonnes of grain in the 2010/11
crop year, and may have no grain available to export after a ban
expires on Dec. 31, Agriculture Ministry data showed on
Thursday.
 ""With a crop of 60-65 million tonnes exports may be 2.0-4.5
million tonnes,"" the ministry said in a presentation.
 It said that Russia may export 2.8 million tonnes of grain,
including 1.6 million tonnes in July and the remainder until
Aug. 15 when the ban it imposed on grain exports to Dec. 31
becomes effective.
 This indicates that under a worst-case scenario the former
No.3 wheat exporter may have no grain available for exports from
Aug. 15. The 2010/11 crop year started on July 1.
 Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Monday the
ban on grain exports might be extended beyond Dec. 31, as a fall
in this year's crop could be worse than expected due to a severe
drought.
 Putin said that Russia was expected to have a supply of 90
million tonnes, which included 60 million tonnes of output, 21
million tonnes of carryover stocks and 9.5 million tonnes of the
government intervention stocks.
 He said this was sufficient to cover Russia's estimated
domestic consumption this year of 78 million tonnes.
 However, the country's carryover stocks, estimated between
21.7 million and 24 million tonnes as of July 1 already include
9.5 million tonnes of the government's intervention stocks,
according to analysts and producers.
 That means that Russia's grain supply this year could be as
low as 81.7-84 million tonnes which leaves a surplus of only
3.7-6.0 million tonnes -- not enough for carryover stocks and
allowing practically no new exports.
 The drought-reduced wheat crop in Russia will give the
United States the chance to sell some of its mounting wheat
surplus, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on Wednesday.

 HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid to a near
three-week low on Thursday on growing doubts about global
economic growth that also helped the dollar cling to its gains
after it scored its biggest rise in nearly two years.
 The dollar climbed against all major currencies save for
the yen, which hit a 15-year high against the U.S. currency on
Wednesday, prompting Japanese policymakers to voice concern
about the currency's strength.
 The verbal intervention and news that the Bank of Japan
checked dollar/yen rates with banks -- an unusual step last
taken during the yen's rally in November -- pushed the yen
lower, helping Tokyo shares pare early losses.
 High yielding currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars and commodity prices also wilted following news
of a surprisingly large U.S. trade deficit and a dowgrade of
Britain's growth forecast by the Bank of England.
 European markets were marginally higher in early trade with
Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> and France's
CAC-40 <.FCHI> all up by about 0.2 percent. But gains were
limited as banks fell on concerns about the global recovery.
 The U.S. trade gap widened 18.8 percent in June, suggesting
its second-quarter economic growth was weaker than previously
thought. The report follows the Federal Reserve's gloomier
economic outlook published earlier this week and a spate of
data from China confirming its rapid imports and factory output
growth was slowing. [ID:nN11206050]

 TOKYO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped on Thursday after
scoring its biggest daily gain for nearly two years against most
major currencies the previous day as concerns about the U.S. and
global economies triggered a wave of unwinding in short dollar
positions.
 But the greenback rose to the day's high of around 85.50 yen
from a 15-year trough against the yen marked the day before,
after market sources told Reuters the Bank of Japan checked
exchange rates with banks earlier on Thursday.
 ""The talk of the BOJ rate checking prompted players to cover
short dollar positions, although bearish sentiment persists for
the dollar,"" said an FX trader at a big Japanese brokerage.
 The U.S. currency fell as low as 84.72 yen on trading
platform EBS on Wednesday, when it took out option barriers
around 85.00 yen and a November low of 84.82 yen. The currency's
slide was fuelled by a narrowing spread between U.S. and Japanese
government bond yields.
 Two-year Treasury yields fell to a fresh all-time low on
Wednesday a day after the Federal Reserve announced a plan to
reinvest the money from maturing mortgage bonds in government
debt to help its economy.
 The euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.2913 as some players bought
back the currency after it dropped more than 2 percent against
the dollar on Wednesday as investors reduced risky positions.
 A rise in euro/yen also supported the single European
currency against the dollar, traders said.
 Against the Japanese yen, the euro was up 0.3 percent at
110.07 yen after hitting a one-month low of 109.24 yen in early
Asian trade.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against six major currencies, was down 0.1 percent on the day at
82.202, but well above its 200-day moving average, now at 80.898.
 On Wednesday, the dollar index soared 2 percent for its
biggest one day rise since October 2008.
 The dollar index might have finally reversed its trend after
steadily sliding in the past two months, traders said.
 It now has immediate support around the 81.53-81.60 region. A
rise beyond a July 21 high of 83.45 would confirm it has bottomed
out.
 INTERVENTION JITTERS
 Against the yen, the dollar was little changed from late U.S.
trade at 85.35 yen in choppy and nervous trade. The pair returned
below 85.00 yen, then received a boost from the Reuters report on
the BOJ checking rates.
 The dollar was also helped as Jiji news said on Thursday that
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan told his chief cabinet
secretary that the yen's sudden gains are ""rough"".
 The yen's strength, especially against the dollar, has
stirred worries that Japanese authorities could intervene to rein
in gains in the Japanese currency.
 A stronger yen is raising alarm among policymakers worried
that it could undermine exporters that have led the economy out
of the global downturn.
 Increasing jitters over possible intervention are prompting
players to book profits on the yen's rally, rather than holding
onto yen longs for an extended period, although many still
believe Japanese authorities will not intervene unless there is a
leap of 3-yen in a day against the dollar, traders said.
 ""Dollar bids that seem to be linked to short-covering in
speculators' short dollar positions keep coming, helping the
market absorb dollar offers,"" said Mitsuru Sahara, chief manager
of FX derivatives trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 A euro zone official told Reuters on Wednesday that European
authorities would not welcome intervention by Japan and joint
intervention by major central banks is not on the cards.
 Traders said the dollar may find some support at the
psychologically key 84.00 yen level and 83.50 yen, around its
July 1995 low. The U.S. currency struck an all-time low below 80
yen in April 1995.

 By Tim Kelly
 TOKYO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - A decade and a half after a
surging yen left Japanese businesses struggling to make money,
Toyota, Panasonic and other leading exporters are again
lamenting a profit-sapping foreign exchange fluctuation.
 This time round, however, they aren't panicking.
 Behind their relative calm lie new foreign factories that
have made many enterprises resistant to yen swings, and years
of deflation which have squeezed wage costs while the rest of
the world inflated.
 The switch to overseas production has been rapid. In 1995,
Toyota, Japan's biggest company, built just 1.3 million
vehicles overseas. By 2009 that had almost tripled to 3.7
million while production in Japan shrank by 190,000 cars to 3.5
million.
 Rivals Honda Motor and Nissan Motor have shifted even
faster, building more than two-thirds of their cars outside
Japan. Four years ago, Japanese auto industry output abroad
surpassed domestic production for the first time.
 With the yen having hit a 15 year high this week and
nudging back toward 80 yen to the dollar, the rationale to do
more overseas production is strengthening. Executives at Toyota
seem eager to do just that.
 ""The best hedge is to build cars where they are sold as
much as possible. We've been taking all these steps for some
time,"" Takahiko Ijichi, a senior Toyota executive, said last
week when announcing operating profits of 211.7 billion yen
($2.48 billion) for April-June, following a loss a year ago.
 Rival Honda would be able to make money this year even at a
dollar rate of 85 yen, its Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Hojo
says, partly because it has bolstered overseas production.
 Executives at Japan's leading consumer-electronics maker,
Panasonic, are also heading for new shores. That a strong yen
means bigger financial clout to buy assets or acquire rivals is
an added incentive to expand abroad.
 ""A manufacturer has to make competitive products, procure
parts locally and increase local production. If you bring goods
back to Japan from there, you are no longer affected by
exchange rates,"" Hitoshi Otsuki, senior managing director in
charge of overseas operations at Panasonic, told a press
briefing recently.
 Measures such as raising imports of refrigerators to Japan
from China to 1.5 million from 1 million will help to offset
the strong yen, Otsuki said. Panasonic didn't give a time-frame
for the import of the China-made refrigerators.
 ""You need steady steps like that. It's not magic,"" he said.
 LEANER, MEANER
 There's no rush, however, to exit the yen zone. Corporate
profits are rebounding. And made lean by recession, companies
are riding the global economic rebound, so these days a rising
yen is less of a drag.
 Nomura senior strategist, Takashi Ito, said in 1999 a one
yen rise against the dollar trimmed recurring profit at
manufacturers on the Nomura 400 index by 2.1 percent, based on
a survey of analysts. For this business year, the squeeze on
earnings from a similar move, according to the strategist, will
be 0.9 percent.
 Overall, operating profit at non-financial companies on the
Nomura 400 index will grow 38 percent in the second quarter
compared with a year ago after jumping 268 percent in the three
months ended June 30, Ito added.
""Despite all the moaning, the yen is at 85 and they
(automakers) are not going to go bust. It's definitely not as
bad as it was,"" said Christopher Richter, a senior auto analyst
at CLSA in Tokyo.
 Corporate Japan is a making a natural shift to lower
currency exposure, said Kirby Daley, senior strategist at
Newedge Group in Hong Kong.
 Firms might start pushing for action if the dollar/yen rate
dips below 80 but Daley doubted the government would wave its
intervention wand.
 If the authorities do leave the dollar/yen rate to the
market, the clamour from companies may be muted. The reason:
the yen is weaker than it looks.
 Persistent deflation after 1995 has made Japanese labour
cheaper. In the past 15 years the average salary in the United
States has ballooned by 50 percent to more than $40,000 as
workers' pay kept pace with rising prices.
 Japan's workforce earns 5 percent less than in 1995. Though
still with a bigger dollar wage packet than their American
counterparts, the gap has narrowed. It means Toyota can still
export 60 percent of its domestic output without having to
scrabble to throw up new overseas plants.
 That deflation disparity, analysts say, means that the
dollar/yen rate would have to surge to 57 or 58 yen to be
equivalent to the record 79.75 yen rate reached in 1995.
 SOPHISTICATED APPROACH
 The strength of the yen is determined by the U.S. economy
and ""there's nothing Japan can do about it,"" said Yuuki
Sakurai, chief executive officer of Fukoku Capital Management,
which manages more than $8 billion in stocks and bonds.
 In the meantime investors are huddling around those
exporters who are capable of hedging currencies, Sakurai said.
Compared with 15 years ago, companies such as Toyota or Nissan
are much more sophisticated, Sakurai added, noting Nissan's
decision this year to shift production of its March model to
Thailand.
 From the end of April to the close of trading on Aug. 6,
when the yen appreciated 9 percent against the dollar and 10
percent against the euro, Toyota's shares dipped 15 percent.
 That decline was only slightly steeper than a 13 percent
fall in shares of Seven & I, Japan's biggest retailer, and a 14
percent dip of its nearest rival Aeon, both companies that
normally benefit as a strong yen makes imports cheaper.
 The benchmark Topix slumped by 13 percent over the same
period. Nissan fell by 19 percent while shares of Mazda, the
most sensitive of Japan's automakers to yen strength, dropped
by one-quarter.
 Among euro-exposed companies feeling the currency pinch was
Nippon Sheet Glass, which also dipped by 25 percent.
 Japan's policymakers fret about their strong-yen economy
like it's 1995, but so far, at least, there has been no repeat
of the crisis that gripped Japanese boardrooms 15 years ago.

 TOKYO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan checked
dollar/yen rates with banks in the foreign exchange market on
Thursday in a way that went beyond its usual contact with them,
market sources said.
 The BOJ asked banks for dollar/yen exchange rates saying it

 The BOJ checked rates in a similar manner when the yen surged

market players say was aimed at curbing the yen's rise.

 TOKYO, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan
decried sudden yen gains as ""rough"" and Japan's currency tsar
discussed financial markets with a central bank official as
authorities' worries mounted over the yen's jump to a 15-year
high versus the dollar.
 The dollar rebounded modestly against the yen on Thursday
after Jiji news agency quoted Kan's comments on the currency to
his chief cabinet secretary, prompting speculators to cover short
dollar positions, although concerns about U.S. growth have
weighed down the greenback.
 Rintaro Tamaki, the finance ministry's top foreign exchange
official, said he had discussed the financial markets' situation
with a Bank of Japan official in charge of international affairs,
but the two had not discussed monetary policy.
 Asked if he had discussed currencies, Tamaki said: ""I
exchanged opinions with Executive Director (Hiroshi) Nakaso on
financial markets in and outside of Japan.""
 ""We only talked about the markets as we are not in charge of
monetary policy,"" Tamaki told reporters at the finance ministry.
 The yen's strength, especially against the dollar, has
stirred worries among traders that Japanese authorities could
intervene to rein in gains in the Japanese currency.
 A stronger yen could threaten to harm Japan's exporters and
derail a feeble recovery from the global crisis.
 Japan's authorities haven't intervened since March 2004, when
a 15-month yen selling spree came to an end.
 The U.S. currency fell to a 15-year low against the yen on

 HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell for the
third straight day on Thursday on rising doubts about global
economic growth, while the dollar steadied after scoring its
biggest gain in nearly two years as investors cut exposure to
riskier assets.
 High yielding currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars and commodity prices also slid following news
of a surprisingly large U.S. trade deficit and a dowgrade of
Britain's growth forecast by the Bank of England.
 ""Globally, there's a growing sense that the economy is
slowing, with a number of economic indicators that appear to
show we have entered a period of adjustment,"" said Kenichi
Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities.
 The U.S. trade gap widened 18.8 percent in June, suggesting
its second-quarter economic growth was weaker than previously
thought. The report came days after the U.S. central bank
issued a gloomier outlook for the economy and followed a spate
of data from China confirming its rapid imports and factory
output growth was slowing.
 The trade data clobbered the three major U.S. indexes,
which logged their worst percentage drops in nearly a month as
investors fled to safer assets.
 Weaker-than-expected revenues from bellwether Cisco Systems
Inc after the U.S. closing bell added to the gloom, weighing on
tech shares in Asia.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks fell 1.2
percent, led by resources and technology shares It is at its
lowest since July 23 and has slid back into negative territory
for the year to date.
 Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar steadied against a basket of
other major currencies after rising nearly 2 percent at one
point overnight to 82.533, well above its 200-day moving
average.
 But it continued to hover near a 15-year low against the
yen, dipping 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade to 85.16 yen
Overnight, the dollar hit a 15-year low of 84.72 yen on
electronic trading platform EBS.
 The yen's gains and a weakening outlook for global demand
continued to pummel shares of Japanese exporters, with the
Nikkei average sliding 2 percent to its lowest levels in over a
month.
 Sony Corp fell 3 percent and chip-tester maker Advantest
Corp dripped 2.9 percent.
 Many Japanese exporters had set their currency rate
assumptions at around 90 yen per dollar for the financial year
to next March.
 The yen has gained nearly 9 percent against the dollar so
far this year as investors looked to lower-risk assets, even
though Japan's economy appears far more frail than that of the
United States.
 RISKY ASSETS RETREAT
 The Australian dollar, which is highly influenced by global
growth expectations, struck a two-week low of $0.8932 and was
down as much as 2.2 percent at one stage for its biggest daily
fall in six weeks. The New Zealand dollar was down about 1
percent at $0.7119, a three-week low.
 Adding to the Aussie's woes was data which showed July
unemployment rose more than expected as more people looked for
work, which lessens the risk of wage pressures building and
adds to the case against a further rise in itnerest rates any
time soon.
 London Brent crude futures fell $1 to $76.64 a barrel on
worries that global demand was stagnating.
 Gold regained strength after falling the previous day as
investors sold bullion to cover losses in equities, but a

(Adds statement from equipment manufacturers)
 By Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
signed a bill on Wednesday aimed at easing costs for U.S.
manufacturers by reducing tariffs on materials used to make the
products they sell.
 The bill is part of a ""Make it in America"" agenda that
Obama's Democrats are pushing ahead of the Nov. 2 congressional
elections. Supporters say the initiatives will reduce the huge
U.S. trade deficit with China and other countries by bolstering
American manufacturing firms.
 ""Our economy has fallen into the habit of buying from
overseas and not selling the way it needs to, but it is vitally
important that we reverse that trend,"" Obama told members of
the business community who gathered at the White House for the
bill signing.
 Obama said the bill would make it ""cheaper and easier for
American manufacturers and American workers to do what they do
best: build great products and sell them around the world.""
 The manufacturing legislation passed overwhelmingly in the
U.S. Congress last month and has the support of many business
groups.
 The National Association of Manufacturers has said it would
boost U.S. manufacturing output by $4.6 billion and support
about 90,000 jobs.
 It would reduce or suspend tariffs on a list of raw
materials and component parts no longer produced in the United
States but used by American companies to make other products.
 Some examples include shoe leather used by companies such
as New Balance to make running shoes and some types of computer
chips used to make computers.
 The global financial crisis led to a major slowdown in
trade, causing the U.S. trade deficit to shrink to $375 billion
in 2009 from $699 billion in 2008.
 As economic growth has returned, the trade gap is on the
rise again.
 A wave of consumer goods imported from China led to a
surprising widening of the U.S. trade deficit in June,
according to a report from the Commerce Department on
Wednesday. The trade gap hit $49.9 billion, the highest since
October 2008.
 The Association of Equipment Manufacturers welcomed the
legislation as a ""small step to leveling the playing field for
equipment manufacturers that seek to export American-made
products.""
 But the industry group also urged the U.S. Congress to
""take immediate action on substantive manufacturing policies,""
such as ratifying free-trade agreements with South Korea,
Panama and Columbia.

 SANTIAGO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Chile's rallying peso will
likely hold onto gains through the end of the year if prices
for copper, the country's top export, stay high and the central
bank continues to raise rates aggressively amid an uncertain
global rebound.
 The peso   fell 7.1 percent against the
dollar in the first half of the year but has appreciated by 6.6
percent since the end of June as the government repatriates
copper profits to rebuild after a devastating earthquake.
 Robust demand as the world's top copper producer recovers
from the quake and global financial crisis has boosted growth
beyond expectations, accelerating the expected pace of the
central bank's cycle of raising interest rates after it held
the base rate at a record low for nearly a year. For more, see

3.75 percent by year-end. For a preview, see [ID:nN0965183]
 While many of the world's leading economies are keeping
interest rates at historic lows, Chile's comparatively higher
rates will likely attract foreign capital and help keep the
peso strong, barring further shocks to investor confidence.
 Some even see room for further gains.
 ""If the price of copper stays high and international
markets keep reducing their risk aversion, we could easily move
below 500 pesos per dollar"" after approaching 550 this year,
said BBVA chief economist Alejandro Puente.
 The peso's recent strength has brought it in line with
regional peers like the Colombian peso and the Brazilian real,
which have weathered international uncertainty well.
 CHINESE COPPER DEMAND UNDERPINS PESO
 ""What distinguishes this year is that when market
conditions abroad have worsened, emerging currencies haven't
depreciated, because the commodities those countries produce
are in greater demand in China than the United States or
Europe,"" said Patricio Roncagliolo, director of FXCM Chile.
 Analysts do not rule out volatility in the meantime, as
renewed concerns about the health of the world economy have
shaken market confidence in recent days.
 But short-term shocks are not likely to weaken the currency
past 525 pesos per dollar, analysts say, as it advances toward
the 510 year-end forecast in a central bank poll of financial
players released on Wednesday. [ID:nN11245410]
 ""The erosion of foreign markets will be something
short-term that should stabilize from now to the end of the
year,"" Roncagliolo said.
 If skittish investors don't slow the peso's rise, analysts
say that the central bank could step in.
 Last week, Central Bank President Jose De Gregorio voiced
concerns about foreign capital flows following rising rates in
emerging economies, saying countries should be ""alert and
thinking what implications that has for monetary policy.""
 During the 2008 commodity boom that pushed the Chilean
currency to 430 pesos per dollar, the central bank began buying
dollars on the local market to build up its reserves.
 ""Strictly speaking, the central bank doesn't have a target
exchange rate. But when the bank president and other board
members say they're concerned about the currency, basically
they're telling us they will react to an intense appreciation
of the peso,"" Puente said.
 Puente and other analysts said the central bank is unlikely
to take concrete actions unless the currency approaches 480
pesos per dollar.

* Oil down 2.8 pct; government bonds rally
(Updates with U.S. markets' close)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Fear roiled global markets on
Wednesday, with stocks sinking and the dollar making its
biggest one-day gain in nearly two years against most
currencies.
 Despite the dollar's broad gains, the Japanese yen hit a
15-year high against the greenback as declining yields on U.S.
government debt prompted Japanese funds, heavily invested in
dollar-denominated Treasuries, to repatriate profits.
 Commodity prices fell, with oil prices sliding 2.8
percent, on fears that a global economic slowdown led by the
United States and China would reduce demand for raw materials.
U.S. gold futures ended only slightly higher as gold's initial
sharp gains faded during the stock market's steep slide.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session with
losses of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, turning negative once more
for the year so far.
 Fears about the sustainability of the global economic
recovery increased after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced on
Tuesday it would use cash from maturing mortgage bonds it
holds to buy more government debt, maintaining the current
level of monetary stimulus. See [ID:nN09275781].
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rallied, with the 10-year note's
yield near 16-month lows, in response to the Fed's expected
re-entry into the bond market and stocks' sharp sell-off.
 Some investors saw the measure as a sign that policy-
makers want to support financial markets while the economy
goes through a possible pause in growth. [ID:nN10161689]
 ""I don't think that we are in for a major correction for
the equity market,"" said Klaus Wiener, head of research at
Generali Investments in London.
 ""The Fed is willing to support the economy. If the economy
slows but does not fall into recession as I expect, then
market confidence in the economy could improve again,"" he
added.
 But that strategy, at least for now, seemed to have
backfired.
 ""If one of the Fed's goals in yesterday's statement was to
instill confidence in the market that they will do anything to
make things better, they accomplished the exact opposite in
that today we are even more worried about economic growth,""
Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New
York, said in a note to clients.
 NASDAQ DOWN 2.7 PCT FOR YEAR
 Adding to investors' woes was data showing a slowdown in
Chinese investment and factory output growth, coupled with a
Bank of England's downgrade of its growth forecast and a
dovish tone from its governor, Mervyn King.
 Chinese annual factory output growth slowed to 13.4
percent last month from 13.7 percent in June ,but beat
forecasts of a 13.2 percent rise. Year-to-date growth in
fixed-asset investments slowed to 24.9 percent from 25.5
percent. [ID:nTOE67A01A]
 ""If China's economy slows down, industries worldwide will
likely feel it in their revenue. That could darken the jobs
picture in this country even further than it already is,"" said
Keith Bliss, senior vice president at Cuttone & Co in New
York.
 The MSCI All-Country World index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2.7
percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top
European shares tumbled 2 percent to end at 1,040.87 -- a
three-week closing low.
 Banking and commodity shares led European markets lower,
with the STOXX Europe 600 banking index <.SX7P> falling 3.4
percent.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
lost 265.42 points, or 2.49 percent, to end at 10,378.83,
while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> sank 31.59
points, or 2.82 percent, to 1,089.47. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> tumbled 68.54 points, or 3.01 percent, to close
at 2,208.63.
 For the year, the Dow was down 0.5 percent, while the S&P
500 was off 2.3 percent and the Nasdaq was down 2.7 percent.
 U.S. Treasuries rallied, with the two-year note's yield
 touching a record low of 0.493 percent earlier in
the session.
 The benchmark 10-year note  shot up 26/32 in
price, with the yield at 2.68 percent, a 16-month low.
 ""The fall in U.S. yields is a barometer of the cyclical
position of the U.S. economy,"" said Adam Cole, head of
currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The market's reaction is that if the U.S. economy is
slowing materially, it will not be in isolation, and it has
therefore responded by selling risk.""
 DANCE OF THE RISING YEN
 The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as
investors became more averse to risk, with the U.S. Dollar
Index <.DXY> up 2.11 percent, its biggest one-day rise since
October 2008.
 The euro  was down 2.32 percent at $1.2871.
 The greenback was practically flat against the Japanese
yen , however, after touching a 15-year low around 84.72
yen earlier in the session.
 Appetite for the yen increased as Treasuries' yield
spreads over Japanese government debt narrowed, prompting the
Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda to say he was closely
watching forex markets.
 Analysts said, however, his rhetoric was unlikely to
escalate into currency intervention to weaken the yen.
[ID:nTKX006931]
 U.S. crude oil  fell $2.23, or 2.78 percent, to
settle at $78.02 a barrel. Crude oil futures prices were also
pressured by a government inventory report showing refined
products stockpiles rose more than expected last week, even
though refiners reduced capacity more than 3 percent.
 In New York, U.S. gold futures  gained $1.20 to
settle at $1,199.20 an ounce, off an intraday high at
$1,210.20.

865,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 05:28PM ET</span>",Colombian exporters wearily eye Venezuela detente," * Santos, Chavez restore diplomatic, not commercial ties
 * Colombian exports to Venezuela plunged 70 percent in H1
 By Jack Kimball and Nelson Bocanegra
 BOGOTA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Colombian exporters may not be
so keen to return to Venezuelan markets following prolonged
curbs on commerce by Caracas and fear of more cross-border
spats ahead, officials and analysts said on Wednesday.
 Venezuela's Hugh Chavez and Colombia's new leader, Juan
Manuel Santos, patched up diplomatic relations on Tuesday after
the latest tit-for-tat argument, but Caracas did not,
crucially, re-establish bilateral commerce.
 Since Chavez curbed cross-border trade last year -- in
protest over a deal by former President Alvaro Uribe to allow
U.S. troops more access to Colombian bases -- some Colombian
businesses now see Venezuela as too risky.
 Exporters from Latin America's No. 4 oil producer have also
begun to search for other markets following the latest cut in
trade. Fiery leftist Chavez has slashed commerce before in his
up-and-down relationship with Colombia, a key U.S. ally.
 ""I would not expect a sharp pick-up in Colombian exports to
Venezuela in the near term. Moreover, Colombian producers will
be cautious as there is a risk that diplomatic/trade disputes
reappear,"" said Carola Sandy, an analyst with Credit Suisse.
 ""In the meantime, Colombian producers will probably
continue to seek different markets for their products, as they
have been doing for the past several months.""
 Colombian exports to Venezuela are expected to plummet to
$1 billion this year from $4 billion last year and $6 billion
in 2008, according to the government. Exports averaged around
$1 billion annually in 1995-2000 before rising five-fold up to
2008.
 Cross-border sales, however, have fallen 70 percent in the
first half of 2010, and Colombian exporters say they are wary
of going back strongly given what they say is Chavez's
unpredictability. In addition, Venezuela still owes Colombian
companies around $800 million in debt.
 ""For us, paying the debt is more important than
re-establishing commerce because there are many companies with
a lot of distrust, very incredulous and worried about exporting
to Venezuela,"" said Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin.
 NATURAL TRADE
 The drop in trade, however, has helped keep Colombian
consumer prices muted and allowed the nation's central bank to
keep up a monetary stimulus plan to boost growth after being
hit by the world financial crisis in 2009.
 Analysts say the cut in exports has shaved a percentage
point off Colombia's growth, but most agree that the drag on
Colombia's economy has run its course.
 Economic growth in the Andean nation is expected to hit
between 3.5 percent and 5.5 percent this year from a slow 0.8
percent in 2009, according to the central bank.

 While some exporters might be scared away, Colombia still
shares a 1,375-mile (2,200-km) border with Venezuela -- which
was once its No. 2 trade partner -- and traders, especially in
consumer goods, will benefit from any commercial restoration.
 ""It could be that Venezuela isn't as important as it was,""
said Javier Diaz, president of the Association of External
Commerce of Colombia.
 ""(But) there's natural trade on the border and a natural
commerce (in) foodstuffs that will rapidly take on a positive
dynamic because of scarcity in Venezuela.""

(New throughout)
 By Michael O'Boyle and Samantha Pearson
 MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso and
Brazil's real slumped on Wednesday as fear of a global economic
slowdown pushed investors into safe havens, while Chile's peso
held its ground and Colombia's currency hit a two-year high.
 Chile's central bank is seen raising its benchmark interest
rate by 50 basis points to 2 percent on Thursday as the
country's economy bounces back more quickly than expected from
a devastating earthquake in February. For details, see:
[ID:nN0965183]
 ""Inflation expectations have been rising, and that is
triggering rates to move higher on the expectation of more
hikes and all that is supporting the currency,"" said Jorge
Perez-Duarte, a managing director of emerging markets trading
at TD Securities in Toronto.
 ""The real attraction is the growth in the economy. Chile
will continue to outperform,"" he added.
 Chile's currency  bid flat at 512.20 per dollar,
shrugging off early losses.
 The Chilean peso has outperformed the region's currencies
over recent weeks and is expected to firm to 510 per dollar
within a week and hold at that level by the end of the year,
according to a new, fortnightly central bank poll.
[ID:nN11245410]
 A Chilean government plan to regulate taxation of
derivatives to encourage currency hedging by smaller companies,
which should boost liquidity, provided further backing for bets
on the peso. [ID:nN11223689]
 Colombia's peso  firmed 0.34 percent to 1,802.45
per dollar, its strongest since August 2008. The Colombian
currency was boosted by the re-establishment of diplomatic ties
between Colombia and Venezuela, according to brokerage
Corredores Asociados.
 The meeting between new Colombian President Juan Manuel
Santos and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez on Tuesday promised a
revival of around $7 billion in bilateral trade.
[ID:nN10132853] and [ID:nN11231503]
 Colombia is also expected to see a rush of around $10
billion in direct foreign investment in its oil and mining
industries this year, and the government estimates that exports
will reach a record $40 billion.
 MEXICO BONDS RALLY
 The Brazilian real  shed 0.68 percent to 1.768 per
dollar while Mexico's peso  shed 1.14 percent to 12.744
per U.S. dollar.
 China, which buys the majority of Brazilian exports,
reported a deceleration in manufacturing last month, raising
concerns about demand for raw materials from the region.
[ID:nTOE67A01A]
 Investors also fled to the safety of the U.S. dollar and
Treasuries after the Federal Reserve downgraded its outlook on
the economy of the United States, Mexico's top trading
partner.
 Steep drops in U.S. stock markets that pushed major indexes
past key technical levels could bode for further losses in U.S.
stocks as well as the real and the Mexican peso, which closely
track global sentiment on riskier assets, analysts said.
 ""The technical positioning is very long these currencies,
so there is the potential for a squeeze and these currencies
could lose more ground,"" said Perez-Duarte.
 Mexican benchmark peso bonds rallied, pushing yields down
to all-time lows. The yield on the 10-year bond  bid
down 10 basis points to 6.40 percent.
 ""Mexican bonds have not been behaving like typical emerging
market assets, but in recent months they have been like safe
havens,"" said Luis Flores, an economist at brokerage IXE in
Mexico City.
 Flores said Mexican bonds have surged to such low yields --
well below where many economists think they should be due to
the inflation outlook -- due to bets of further flows into the
country.
 Market players expect billions of dollars to flow into
Mexican bonds around October, when more than $100 billion of
peso debt will be included in Citigroup's World Government Bond
index.

(Updates to close)
 By Ka Yan Ng
 OTTAWA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slid to its
lowest level in nearly three weeks on Wednesday, while bonds
surged, as a spate of disappointing indicators, including
widening North American trade deficits, left investors worried
about the global economic recovery.
 Canada posted a June trade deficit of C$1.13 billion nearly
four times expectations, while the U.S. monthly trade gap
widened by 19 percent to $49.9 billion, the biggest shortfall
since October 2008. [ID:nN15446129] [ID:nN11208864]
 ""It was a double whammy of bad news for the currency,"" said
Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
""Canada's trade report showed a considerable widening in our
trade deficit, partly because of a drop in exports, and the
weak U.S. trade report will fan fears of a faltering U.S.
economic recovery, which will raise concerns about further
weakness in Canadian exports.""
 As a result, the Canadian currency, already under pressure
from pessimistic outlooks from the U.S. Federal Reserve and
Bank of England, as well as weak Chinese economic data, fell
more than a penny after breaking a key technical level of
C$1.04 early in the session, and stayed well below it.
 The currency  finished at C$1.0453 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.67 U.S. cents, recovering from its session low of
C$1.0475 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.47 U.S. cents, its weakest
level since July 22.
 It was off more than a penny from Tuesday's finish at
C$1.0323 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.87 U.S. cents.
 David Bradley, director of foreign exchange trading at
Scotia Capital, said the Canadian dollar may be ""particularly
vulnerable"" to a slower global economy since it is sensitive to
factors such as commodity prices and may also track equity
markets, which could extend declines.
 He said a close beyond C$1.0410 to the U.S. dollar could
set up a test of C$1.0725 to C$1.0750. These levels have not
been seen since late May and would be a reversal from late last
week when the currency looked set to approach parity with the
greenback, a level it has not seen since April.
 A climb towards parity is probably on hold for now, as
analysts said it was more likely that Canada's dollar could
stumble further in the near term as worrying global economic
data dims investor appetite for so-called growth currencies.
[ID:nN11262027]
 BONDS PRICES TAKE FLIGHT
 Canadian bond prices extended their gains, particularly
rate-sensitive short-dated issues, which shot higher as market
players recalibrated their views on the global economy and
shifted to the security of government debt issues.
 Risky assets fell out of favor, with North American stock
indexes losing between 2 and 3 percent. [ID:nN11241585]
 ""We're seeing a flight to quality today because of the
rotation out of risky assets and a reappraisal of the Bank of
Canada's tightening trajectory,"" said Fergal Smith, managing
market strategist at Action Economics.
 Market pricing, measured by yields on overnight index
swaps, fell to around a 50 percent chance of quarter-point rate
hike in September from around 58 percent before the day's data.

 The two-year bond  jumped 18 Canadian cents to
yield 1.352 percent, while the 10-year bond  added
52 Canadian cents to yield 2.972 percent.
 An auction of two-year government of Canada bonds attracted
decent demand, producing a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.523 that was
close to the recent average. [ID:nN11232264] [CA/AUC]

 By Steven C. Johnson and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar on Wednesday
chalked up its biggest daily gain in nearly two years against
major currencies as a gloomy U.S. economic growth outlook and
weak Chinese data suggested global growth was faltering.
 Investors reacted by dumping risky assets, including
higher-yielding currencies and stocks, and taking refuge in the
U.S. dollar and safe haven U.S. Treasuries.
 The Intercontinental Exchange's (ICE) U.S. dollar index, a
weighted index of six currencies against the dollar, soared 1.8
percent for it's biggest one day rise since October 2008.
 The dollar had been under steady pressure over the last six
weeks as weak U.S. economic reports fed fears that economic
growth was slowing.
 But markets have since grown anxious about the state of the
broader world economy, with some investors afraid the sluggish
U.S. economy will slow growth beyond American shores as well.
 Data on Wednesday showing a slowdown in Chinese factory
output intensified these fears, analysts said.
 Slower U.S. growth ""creates problems for China, for Japan,
for the world,"" said Robert Smith, chairman of Smith Affiliated
Capital, a New York firm with $2.2 billion under management.
 ""Everyone's waking up and talking deflation. There's still
money to be made in U.S. Treasuries in this environment, and I
think the dollar will continue to surprise people.""
 The yen was the only major currency to rise against the
dollar which hit a 15-year low around 84.72 yen 
 Heavy purchases of safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, which pushed
yields lower, encouraged Japanese investors with large
dollar-denominated Treasury holdings to take profits and return
funds into yen. Japan is the second-largest holder of
Treasuries after China.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a record low a day
after the Federal Reserve downgraded its U.S. growth outlook
and said it would try to revive the flagging economy by buying
more government debt with cash from maturing mortgage bonds.

 The euro lost 2.2 percent to $1.2882 , its lowest
close since late July and its worst one-day showing since
October 2008. Sterling fell 1.1 percent to $1.5676 
after the UK central bank said inflation would fall below its 2
percent target level in two years.
 'WIN WIN' FOR YEN
 The dollar hit a 15-year low at 84.72 yen  on
electronic trading platform EBS after taking out option
barriers at 85.00 and 84.75, fueled by a narrowing of the
spread between U.S. and Japanese two-year yields. It was last
down 0.2 percent at 85.24 yen.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in
London, said the Fed's ""outright Treasuries purchases will
likely extend the yen's win-win scenario."" Falling U.S. yields
will keep Japanese capital at home, while falling stocks will
also boost the currency, he said.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Wednesday he
was closely watching foreign exchange markets, but analysts
doubted his comments would escalate into currency intervention
to weaken the yen. For details, see [ID:nTKX006931]
 A euro zone official told Reuters on Wednesday that
authorities in Brussels would welcome Japanese intervention,
saying the yen will likely benefit as Asian demand increases.
[ID:nTST002429]
 ""Japan needs the support of the U.S. and Europe to
intervene, but the Fed and the European Central Bank are
focused on other problems right now. So I don't think it is
possible at these levels,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency
analyst at UBS in Zurich. ""I see no upside for dollar/yen right
now, and I can see it falling toward 80 yen,"" he said.
 The record low came in April 1995 at about 79.75 yen.
 The yen gained across the board, with the euro down 2.5
percent at 109.74 yen  and the Australian dollar
 losing 1.8 percent.

869,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 04:20PM ET</span>",Obama signs bill to ease U.S. manufacturers' costs," By Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
signed a bill on Wednesday aimed at easing costs for U.S.
manufacturers by reducing tariffs on materials used to make the
products they sell.
 The bill is part of a ""Make it in America"" agenda Obama's
Democrats are pushing ahead of the Nov. 2 congressional
elections. Backers say the initiatives will reduce the huge
U.S. trade deficit with China and other countries by bolstering
American manufacturing firms.
 ""Our economy has fallen into the habit of buying from
overseas and not selling the way it needs to but it is vitally
important that we reverse that trend,"" Obama told an audience
of businesspeople gathered at the White House for the bill
signing.
 Obama said the bill would make it ""cheaper and easier for
American manufacturers and American workers to do what they do
best: build great products and sell them around the world.""
 The manufacturing legislation passed overwhelmingly in the
U.S. Congress last month and has the support of many business
groups.
 The National Association Manufacturers has said it would
boost U.S. manufacturing output by $4.6 billion and support
about 90,000 jobs.
 It would reduce or suspend tariffs on a list of raw
materials and component parts no longer produced in the United
States but used by American companies to make other products.
 Some examples include shoe leather used by companies such
as New Balance to make running shoes and some types of computer
chips used to make computers.
 The global financial crisis led to a major slowdown in
trade, causing the U.S. trade deficit to shrink to $375 billion
in 2009 from $699 billion in 2008.
 As economic growth has returned, the trade gap is on the
rise again.
 A wave of consumer goods imported from China led to a
surprising widening of the U.S. trade deficit in June,
according to a report from the Commerce Department on
Wednesday. The trade gap hit $49.9 billion, the highest since
October 2008.

 * European Commission says Slovaks breach solidarity
 * Parliament approves participation in the EFSF
 
 (adds comments from EU's Rehn)
 By Martin Santa
 BRATISLAVA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Slovakia's parliament
torpedoed a bilateral loan to debt-laden Greece on Wednesday and
the European Commission reprimanded the euro zone's poorest
member state for breaching solidarity principles.
 Slovakia's politicians have questioned the fairness of
calling on its taxpayers to aid wealthier countries who failed
to control debt, and the new centre-right cabinet has placed
conditions on its role in an emergency loan facility.
 ""I can only regret this breach of solidarity within the euro
area and I expect the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council to return
to the matter in their next meeting,"" the EU's Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement.
 Rehn said Slovakia's decision to withhold its contribution
did not put in danger the 110 billion euro ($143 billion)
bailout package for Greece organised by the EU and the
International Monetary Fund.
 ""The Slovak Parliament vote will not have any negative
implication for the disbursement of the instalments of the
loan,"" said Rehn.
 Slovakia has one of the lowest debt burdens in the European
Union with debt at around 36 percent of economic output, a point
lawmakers made when they rejected their 816 million euro share
of the IMF/EU package for Greece -- whose debt is bigger than
its annual economic output.
 The parliamentary votes went in line with recommendations
from the cabinet. Only one deputy voted in favour of the Greek
loan.
 ""I do not consider this as solidarity if it is solidarity
between poor and rich, of the responsible with the
irresponsible, or tax payers with bank owners and managers,""
Finance Minister Ivan Miklos told the parliament.
 The monthly minimum wage in the ex-communist country is 308
euros, well below the Greek minimum legal wage of 863 euros.
 Teams from the IMF, European Commission and European Central
Bank are assessing Greece's progress in cutting its deficit and
pursuing labour market and other reforms before releasing the
second tranche from the 110 billion euro programme, due next
month.
 
 SLOVAKS JOIN EURO ZONE'S SAFETY NET
 Parliament did, however, approve Slovakia's participation in
a euro zone loan facility designed to aid countries in trouble.
 Prime Minister Iveta Radicova's government had previously
held up the 750 billion euro loan facility, the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), after objections to
bailouts became a campaign issue in a June election.
 On Wednesday, parliament approved participation in the
package and agreed to contribute Slovakia's share of the
facility, which is 4.5 billion euros worth of guarantees.
 Bratislava in July demanded the creation of stricter fiscal
rules in the euro zone, including a mechanism for bankruptcy for
countries with irresponsible fiscal policies, before any aid
from the EFSF fund is released.
 Slovakia joined the European Union in 2004 and adopted the
euro currency in January last year.

872,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 03:04PM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Stumbling America, debt-strapped Europe, booming China"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Strip away all the complexities
facing the world economy at the moment and you come down to
three interlocking puzzles: America, Europe and China.
 Stumbling America, debt-strapped Europe and booming China,
that is.
The three face different, sometimes contradictory,
challenges. Yet they are so intertwined in this era of
globalisation that it is hard to imagine how events in one could
possibly not spill over into the other.
 Jim O'Neill and his economics team at Goldman Sachs recently
sought to boil down the risks facing the world economy -- and,
by extension, financial markets -- to three neat questions.
 -- How deep will the U.S. economic slowdown be and what will
the policy response be? (That's two questions, actually, but
let's not nitpick).
 -- How much decoupling is possible between the U.S. economy
and others which are growing well, notably China?
 -- Will sovereign and systemic risks intensify again or
settle? (A clear reference to the euro zone, where the Greek
debt crisis has gone to sleep but not disappeared.)
 For the record, Goldman believes the answers will not
necessarily signify trouble. ""Our own forecasts envisage a
period of some muddiness in the near term that ultimately
resolves towards a more positive global view,"" it says.
 But it also notes there are fragilities in the economic
system which require open-mindedness about the risks.
 Burrow down a bit and you can come up with three
subsections, part of which come courtesy of Mike Dicks, head of
investment strategy at Barclays Wealth. They are:
 -- America: Will the U.S. consumer stop spending?
 -- Europe: Will attempts to control debt snuff out nascent
signs of recovery?
 -- China: Will it make a policy mistake and douse rather
than cool its economic engine?
 
 GORDIAN KNOT
 For all their differences, these three risks and subsets are
so closely woven together that a positive outcome for all is
probably necessary for the world economy to move out of its
current phase unscathed.
 It is not so much the vaunted three-speed economy as a
three-legged stool, ready to tip if one support gives way.
 Consider, for example, a dive in U.S. consumer spending from
its already moderate level. If spending actually starts to match
sentiment -- and the recent jobs data does not bode well -- a
booming China would find its key market drying up.
 Attempts by U.S. authorities to reverse the slide into a
double-dip recession and even deflation would almost certainly
involve printing even more dollars than is currently the case,
undermining, through devaluation, the competitiveness of
European exporters, among others.
 As for Europe's big problem, the debt crisis triggered
earlier this year by fears of a Greek default has eased,
supported by a huge bailout plan and a generally positive stress
test on the region's banks.
 But few analysts believe the problem has gone away for good.
Governments, cognisant of this, have embarked on a variety of
austerity plans that could threaten what nascent growth there is
-- a worry for U.S and Chinese exporters.
 A renewed confidence crisis in Europe's debt would not stay
European for long. The U.S. deficit and debt pile is easily as
worrying for those looking for fiscal balance as is Europe's.
 Turning to the third leg of the stool, Barclay's Dicks
argues that China poses the least problems. But that is a long
way from saying that it can hold everything up on its own.
 True, there are signs that China and other big emerging
markets are beginning to create domestic demand. But it is early
days and exporting is still the big game.
 Controlling inflation in China is the biggest worry for
economists, with fears mainly revolving around a policy mistake
that will overdo the required slowdown.
 As Dicks says: ""We hope for a soft landing, but worry about
a hard one.""

 UNCERTAINTY
 None of these fears may materialise, of course. U.S.
consumers are renowned for their resilience. Chinese authorities
can and do manage their economy tightly. Europe is currently
showing signs of a rebound, not a rewind.
 But the dangers are there and weighing both on authorities'
minds and on financial markets.
 Where the world stands was graphically depicted in a recent
report by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which surveyed
the opinions of influential economic bloggers.
 As befits a study of the blogosphere, the foundation
presented some of its findings in a ""word cloud"" made up of the
most common words used by respondents to describe the U.S.
economy.
 One word stood out -- ""Uncertain"". Not terribly useful, but
then that is the nature of uncertainty.

 * Bond prices soar on flight to safety
 * Canada trade deficit widens; to drag on Q2 growth
(Updates to late afternoon)
 By Ka Yan Ng
 OTTAWA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar tumbled to
its lowest level in nearly three weeks against the greenback on
Wednesday, while bonds surged, as a spate of disappointing
indicators, including widening North American trade deficits,
left investors to reassess the world economic recovery.
 Canada posted a trade deficit in June of C$1.13 billion
nearly four times expectations, while the U.S. monthly trade
gap widened by 19 percent to $49.9 billion, the biggest
shortfall since October 2008. [ID:nN15446129] [ID:nN11208864]
 ""It was a double whammy of bad news for the currency,"" said
Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
""Canada's trade report showed a considerable widening in our
trade deficit, partly because of a drop in exports, and the
weak U.S. trade report will fan fears of a faltering U.S.
economic recovery, which will raise concerns about further
weakness in Canadian exports.""
 As a result, the Canadian currency, already under pressure
from pessimistic outlooks from the U.S. Federal Reserve and
Bank of England, as well as weak Chinese economic data, fell
more than a penny after breaking a key technical level of
C$1.04 early in the session, and stayed well below it.
 At 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT), the currency  was at
C$1.0462 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.58 U.S. cents, not far from
its session low of C$1.0475 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.47 U.S.
cents, its weakest level since July 22.
 It was off more than a penny from Tuesday's finish at
C$1.0323 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.87 U.S. cents.
 David Bradley, director of foreign exchange trading at
Scotia Capital, said the Canadian dollar may be ""particularly
vulnerable"" to a slower global economy since it is sensitive to
factors such as commodity prices and may also track equity
markets, which may extend declines.
 He said a close beyond C$1.0410 to the U.S. dollar could
set up a test of C$1.0725 to C$1.0750. These levels have not
been seen since late May.
 BONDS PRICES TAKE FLIGHT
 Canadian bond prices extended their gains, as the
dramatically higher trade deficit figures lent more support to
lower-risk government debt.
 The interest-rate sensitive short-dated issues saw their
prices shoot higher as market players reassessed the global
economy on the back of a string of soft data and a gloomier
outlook from the Fed on Tuesday.
 ""We're seeing a flight to quality today because of the
rotation out of risky assets and a reappraisal of the Bank of
Canada's tightening trajectory,"" said Fergal Smith, managing
market strategist at Action Economics.
 Yields on overnight index swaps tumbled to around 50
percent from around 58 percent before the day's data,
reflecting the market's view that the chances of a
quarter-point rate hike in September are now less likely.

 The two-year bond  jumped 18 Canadian cents to
yield 1.352 percent, while the 10-year bond  added
52 Canadian cents to yield 2.972 percent.
 An auction of two-year government of Canada bonds attracted
decent demand, producing a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.523 that was
close to the recent average. [ID:nN11232264] [CA/AUC]

 * Upgrade to investment grade in doubt, politics a risk
 * Compelling valuations may yet offer buying opportunity
 
 By Carolyn Cohn and Sujata Rao
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Delays to key reforms in Turkey
may merely dent rather than destroy investors' enthusiasm for an
economy whose higher growth and lower inflation prospects have
taken it to the top of fund managers' shopping lists.
 Turkish shares, among the best-performing emerging equities
this year, fell to a three-week low and bond yields rose after
the country's industry minister said fiscal reforms -- aimed at
cutting budget deficits and debt -- would not be implemented
next year as expected.
 The news comes at a time when global risk appetite is
looking shaky again and positioning in Turkey is pretty crowded.
Yet this delay by itself, even though it gives the government
leeway to spend ahead of a July 2011 election, may not in the
long term lessen Turkey's desirability for investors.
 Turkey is fund managers' top equity play with a net 60
percent overweight, Merrill Lynch/BoA's monthly survey revealed
in July. Turkish stocks have hit record highs in recent weeks,
led by banks which are benefiting from a strong rise in consumer
lending as well as low interest rates.
 With foreign investors holding an estimated 70 percent of
Turkey's stock market, the ingredients for a reversal are there.
 ""This is not great news and it makes you wonder if they are
serious about fiscal policy,"" said Will Calvert, who runs $600
million in emerging equities at Axa Investment Managers, and
whose biggest overweight is Turkey.
 ""I would start getting worried if you see government
finances deteriorating and if you see policy going the wrong
way. I still like Turkey, but when you get news like this there
is a tipping point of credibility. It can make you feel
incrementally negative about the country.""
 Ratings agencies expressed concern, fuelling worry that they
may hold off on Turkey's long-awaited upgrade to investment
grade, a status that tends to bring in a bigger pool of
international investors.
 Turkey is rated Ba2 by Moody's and BB by S&P, two notches
below investment grade, and BB+ by Fitch.
 Yet Calvert says valuations remain compelling, meaning
foreigners are unlikely to bail out en masse just yet.
 MSCI's Turkey index trades at around 9 times 12-month
forward earnings, compared with 11 times for the MSCI global
emerging equities index.
 
 NO MORE UPGRADE?
 Even a breakdown in talks with the International Monetary
Fund earlier this year failed to deter foreign fund managers,
although this could quickly change.
 ""One of the reasons why Turkey has been performing so
strongly recently is that markets bought the idea Turkey was
prepared to implement strong fiscal policy independent of the
IMF,"" said Manik Narain, emerging markets strategist at UBS.
 ""This raises the concern the political situation will
influence the budget next year and it probably does push back
Turkey's ability to be upgraded this year."" 
 Narain said he remained long of the Turkish lira, however.
 Turkey's status as an investor favourite is relatively new.
It had a history of fiscal mismanagement until the AK Party
government, backed by the IMF, led the economy back from the
ruins of a financial crisis after it came to power in 2002. 
 Today, the years of hyperinflation -- between 1999 and 2001
price growth averaged 122 percent -- are a distant memory. The
central bank expects 2010 inflation at 7.5 percent.
 Surging budget revenues and careful government spending cut
Turkey's budget deficit by 33.5 percent in the first half of
2010 versus year-ago levels. The primary budget surplus, which
excludes interest payments, surged 200 percent.
 The rate cuts and inflation outlook boosted Turkish bonds,
taking yields to 10-month lows.
 ""The fiscal rule was an external discipline, we would rather
have it than not, but the macro-economic situation in Turkey has
been conducted in a way we are very happy with,"" said Ghadir Abu
Leil-Cooper, head of EMEA equities at Baring Asset Management.
 ""We like to have exposure to the Turkish consumer and the
best way to do that is through Turkish banks.""
 
 TIME TO BUY?
 Investors say the risk is that Turkey's primary surpluses
are eroded, pushing up government borrowing and crowding out
private investment. 
 But many say further falls in Turkish asset prices are a
buying opportunity after recent bond and stocks rallies.
 All emerging markets were under pressure on Wednesday
following the U.S. Federal Reserve's downbeat assessment of the
U.S. economy, and Turkish markets did not massively
underperform.
 ""We're not changing our position -- which is overweight to
the benchmark. And we plan to increase the overweight if there's
further consolidation,"" said one emerging bond fund manager in
London.
 Jeremy Brewin, fixed income portfolio manager at Aviva, also
plans to add to his position in Turkey if prices fall further.
 ""This is an emerging market so there will always be
slippages in terms of timing,"" he said. ""We score them higher
than rating agencies -- we're used to the idea that Ankara's
agenda is not going to meet everyone's.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday
and was headed for its best day in nearly two years against a
basket of major currencies as a gloomy U.S. outlook and weak
Chinese data suggested the world economy was slowing.
 Investors reacted by ditching all manner of risky assets,
including higher-yielding currencies and stocks, and taking
refuge in the dollar and Japanese yen. The yen was the only
major currency to rise against the greenback, which fell to a
15-year low around 85.72 yen. 
 Heavy purchases of safe-haven U.S. Treasury debt, which
pushed yields sharply lower, also helped the yen as Japanese
investors with large dollar-denominated Treasury holdings
repatriated profits. Japan is the second largest holder of
Treasuries after China.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a record low a day
after the Federal Reserve downgraded its U.S. growth outlook
and said it would try to revive the flagging economy by buying
more government debt with cash from maturing mortgage bonds.
[ID:nN09275781]
 China reported a slowdown in factory output, adding to the
picture of softening domestic demand. [ID:nTOE67A01A]
 ""The consensus is that, as major economies around the world
show reduced growth, this is being perceived negatively for
stocks. As stocks go down in value, investors are pulling out,
and this is proving positive for the U.S. dollar and yen,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in
New York.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, <.DXY> which tracks the
greenback versus a basket of six currencies, soared 1.9 percent
to 82.160, the biggest one-day percentage rise since October
2008. It touched a high of 82.394, its strongest since late
July.
 The euro  lost 2.1 percent to $1.2904, the lowest
level since late July and its worst one-day showing since
January.
 'WIN WIN' FOR YEN
 The dollar dropped to 84.72 yen  on electronic
trading platform EBS after taking out option barriers at 85.00
and 84.75, fueled by a narrowing of the spread between U.S. and
Japanese two-year yields. It was last down 0.2 percent at 85.22
yen.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in
London, said the Fed's ""outright Treasuries purchases will
likely extend the yen's win-win scenario."" Falling U.S. yields
will keep Japanese capital at home, while falling stocks will
also boost the currency, he said.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Wednesday he
was closely watching foreign exchange markets, but analysts
doubted his comments would escalate into currency intervention
to weaken the yen. For details, see [ID:nTKX006931]
 ""Japan needs the support of the U.S. and Europe to
intervene, but the Fed and the European Central Bank are
focused on other problems right now. So I don't think it is
possible at these levels,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency
analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 ""I see no upside for dollar/yen right now, and I can see it
falling towards 80 yen,"" he said.
 The record low in dollar/yen came in April 1995 at about
79.75 yen.
 The yen gained across the board, with the euro down more
than 2 percent at 110.11 yen  and the Aussie
 losing 1.7 percent.
 Adam Cole, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said
that while concerns about U.S. growth have intensified,
investors have reacted by selling risk instead of selling the
dollar on a view that if the U.S. economy is slowing
materially, it will not be in isolation.
 ""Dollar/yen is really not the big story today. Yen crosses
are,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""The markets are concerned
about world growth, not just the U.S.""
 Elsewhere, sterling fell more than 1 percent against the
dollar  after the Bank of England said UK inflation
would fall well below its 2 percent target in two years, even
if interest rates stay low. [nKING]

 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Fear returned to global

its biggest one-day gain in nearly two years against most
major currencies on renewed worries of an economic slowdown in
China and the United States.
 Even as the dollar strengthened across the board, the
Japanese yen hit a 15-year high against the greenback as the
yield spreads of U.S. Treasury debt over those of Japanese
government bonds narrowed.
 Commodity prices fell, with oil prices sliding more than
$2 to below $79 per barrel, on fears that a global economic
slowdown would reduce demand for raw materials.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes slid 2 percent to 3

slows but does not fall into recession as I expect, then
market confidence in the economy could improve again,"" he

backfired.

 ""The market's reaction is that if the U.S. economy is
slowing materially, it will not be in isolation, and it has

 The euro  was down 2.13 percent at $1.2896.
 Against the Japanese yen , however, the greenback
weakened 0.19 percent to 85.24 as declining U.S. Treasury
yields prompted Japanese funds, heavily invested in
dollar-denominated Treasuries, to repatriate profits.

(Adds details)
 By Ka Yan Ng
 OTTAWA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Canada's trade deficit ballooned
to more than three times expectations in June, hit by lower
exports of industrial goods and materials, in the latest sign
the economic recovery is slowing.
 The shortfall totaled C$1.13 billion ($1.06 billion) as the
trade deficit surged from a revised C$695 million in May. Both
imports and exports fell, Statistics Canada data showed on
Wednesday.
 May's deficit was originally reported at a C$503 million.
 The Canadian dollar  skidded to its weakest level
against the greenback in nearly three weeks as the trade
deficit soared past the average analyst forecast for a June
shortfall of just C$300 million.
 The deficit easily surpassed the most bearish estimate of
for a shortfall of C$1.05 billion among 20 analysts surveyed by
Reuters [CAD/], and mirrored a surprising jump in the U.S.
trade deficit for June and a weaker economic outlook for
Canada's biggest trading partner.
 ""Trade data can be choppy, but when two-way trade stalls in
two of the last three months, that can't be bullish for global
growth. Weak volumes and soft prices conspired to take Canada's
trade balance to its worst tally in 10 months,"" said Krishen
Rangasamy, economist at CIBC World Markets.
 As one of the components to shaping second-quarter growth
numbers, several analysts said the trade report will weigh on
those figures and follows recent data that has shown the pace
of economic recovery has decidedly ebbed from a dazzling
first-quarter GDP growth of 6.1 percent.
 The Bank of Canada clipped its second-quarter growth
forecast to 3 percent last month, and said net exports would
crimp growth by 1.6 percent this year.
 Canada's trade deficit is just one of several recent
indicators that reinforced concerns about a lackluster global
economic recovery, pressuring riskier assets such as equities
and commodities. The data added to soft manufacturing numbers
from China and a gloomier growth outlook from the U.S. Federal

 While economists say the Bank of Canada is likely to remain
on track to raise interest rates in September for a third time
this year, markets were less convinced of a quarter-point
increase to 1 percent.
 Market pricing for the policy rate, as measured by yields
on overnight index swaps, tumbled to around 50 percent from 58
percent before the day's data. 
 The data prompted at least one Canadian bank to formally
revise its second-quarter growth outlook. Others highlighted
the risk of weaker than expected economic expansion.
 ""For all of Q2, the trade deficit came in at a C$6.4
billion annual rate, compared with a surplus of C$4.7 billion
in Q1. That swing will translate into a big drag from net
exports in the broader GDP results,"" said Doug Porter, deputy
chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 ""As a result, we have trimmed our GDP estimate for Q2 to
2.3 percent from 2.7 percent.""
 EXPORTS, IMPORTS BOTH FALL
 Exports missed estimates, falling 2.5 percent in June to
C$33.5 billion from C$34.4 billion in May, as shipments of
industrial goods and materials, such as precious metals, fell
for a third straight month.
 Automotive products, which accounted for over half the
growth of exports in the prior month, gave back some of those
gains. Exports of passenger cars fell 7.1 percent in June.
 Imports at C$34.6 billion were exactly on expectations,
reflecting a drop in energy shipments. Excluding energy
products, imports grew 0.9 percent in June from May.
 Analysts had, on average, forecast imports of C$34.6
billion and exports at C$34.3 billion.
 Canada's trade surplus with the United States narrowed to
C$3.03 billion from C$3.45 billion.
 Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department reported the trade
deficit there widened a surprising 18.8 percent in June and
suggested U.S. second-quarter economic growth was much weaker
than previously thought. [ID:nN11206050]
 Meanwhile, Canada's deficit with countries other than the
United States grew to C$4.16 billion from C$4.14 billion, the
largest gap since December 2009.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rallied sharply
against most currencies on Wednesday but fell to a 15-year low
against the yen as a gloomier outlook from the Federal Reserve
and slower Chinese factory growth dented risk appetite.
 Both the dollar and yen gained as world stocks fell,
prompting investors to flock to safe-haven currencies. But the
yen made inroads against the dollar as declining U.S. yields
prompted Japanese funds, heavily invested in dollar-denominated
Treasuries, to repatriate profits.
 Yields on two-year Treasury debt hit a record low after the
U.S. central bank said on Tuesday it would use cash from
maturing mortgage bonds to buy more government debt to revive a
faltering U.S. economic recovery.
 ""The consensus is that as major economies around the world
show reduced growth, this is being perceived negatively for
stocks. As stocks go down in value, investors are pulling out
and this is proving positive for the U.S. dollar and yen,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in
New York.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks the
greenback versus a basket of six currencies, soared 1.8 percent
to 82.223, the biggest one-day percentage rise since October,
2008. It touched a high of 82.394, its strongest since late
July.
 The euro lost 2.2 percent to $1.2892, the lowest level
since late July.
 WIN WIN FOR YEN
 The dollar dropped to 84.72 yen on electronic trading
platform EBS, after taking out option barriers at 85.00 and
84.75, fueled by a narrowing of the spread between U.S. and
Japanese two-year yields.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in
London, said the Fed's ""outright Treasuries purchases will
likely extend the yen's win-win scenario."" Falling U.S. yields
will keep Japanese capital at home, while falling stocks will
also boost the currency, he said.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Wednesday
that he was closely watching forex markets, but analysts
doubted his rhetoric would escalate into currency intervention
to weaken the yen.
 ""Japan needs the support of the U.S. and Europe to
intervene, but the Fed and the European Central Bank are
focused on other problems right now so I don't think it is
possible at these levels,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency
analyst at UBS in Zurich.
 ""I see no upside for dollar/yen right now and I can see it
falling towards 80 yen,"" he said.
 The record low in dollar/yen was hit in April 1995 around
79.75 yen.
 The yen gained across the board, with the euro down more
than 2 percent at 110.11 yen and the Aussie losing 1.7
percent.
 Adam Cole, currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said
while concerns about U.S. growth have grown, investors have
reacted by selling risk instead of selling the dollar on a view
that if the U.S. economy is slowing materially, it will not be
in isolation.
 ""Dollar/yen is really not the big story today, yen crosses
are,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""The markets are concerned
about world growth, not just the U.S.""
 Elsewhere, sterling fell more than 1 percent against the
dollar after the Bank of England said UK inflation would fall
well below its 2 percent target in two years even if interest
rates stay low.

 * ""People to people"" commerce booms after Obama measures
 * On the island, underground financial services emerge
 By Esteban Israel
 HAVANA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - It all starts with a description
given over a mobile phone: ""Look for a woman with long blonde
hair, blue jeans, silver heels and a black T-shirt arriving on
the next flight from Miami.""
 When the woman emerges from Havana's international airport
pushing a cart loaded with bulky black duffel bags, she is
greeted effusively by a man she has never seen before.
 ""They hug as if they had known each other all their lives.
Once in the parking lot, the woman hands over the bags and says
goodbye,"" says Yanet, a Miami resident.
 She is describing the tactics of growing numbers of human
""mules"" who regularly travel between the United States and Cuba
carrying in their bags loads of clothes, food, consumer goods,
electrical appliances and millions of U.S. dollars to the
communist-ruled Caribbean island. They deliver the goods for a
fee or free ticket, often to complete strangers.
 ""The system works beautifully,"" said Yanet, making her
second trip as a ""mule"" to Havana in less than a month.
 ""But you have to stage a little show because you never know
who may be watching,"" she added.
 This burgeoning informal commerce between two neighbors
whose governments have maintained a Cold War-era enmity for
half a century belies the 48-year-old U.S. trade embargo
against Cuba -- but also reflects recent relaxations of it.
 Since 1962, the U.S. embargo's intended aim has been to
force the Cuban government to abandon its communist rule.
 But informal trafficking of cash and goods to Cuba has
boomed since U.S. President Barack Obama last year lifted
restrictions on Cuban Americans traveling to their homeland and
significantly increased the amount of money they could take.
 His calibrated measures, part of a process of promoting
""people-to-people"" contacts Washington believes can foster
political change in Cuba, also increased the type of consumer
items that could be included in gift parcels for Cuba.
 Also authorized under a telecoms initiative was the export
or re-export to Cuba by visitors of donated personal telecoms
devices, such as mobile phones, computers and software.
 Travelers to Havana were already able to bring parcels of
food and medicines, and the embargo has for some years allowed
the export of U.S. farm products to the island.
 ""MORE TRAVELERS, MORE MONEY""
 On the U.S. side, from where daily two-way charter flights
ferry more and more Cuban Americans to Cuba on family visits,
there is significant tolerance for passengers to load up with
consumer goods.
 But the mules also need to outsmart tight Cuban customs
restrictions, where taxes are levied for baggage over certain
limits and luggage contents are frequently inspected.
 Chronic scarcity and the high prices of the narrow range of
imported goods that are sold in Cuba's state-run dollar stores
have prompted thousands of Cubans to use the human ""mules"" to
import everything from clothing to toiletries, electronics and
money.
 John Kavulich, who monitors commerce between the two
nations at the New York-based U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council, says it is impossible to accurately quantify this
informal trade.
 ""But more travelers means more money and more expenditure
in Cuba,"" he said.
 Manuel Orozco, a remittances expert with the Inter-American
Dialogue think-tank in Washington, says Cuban exiles in the
United States sent to the island some $636 million in 2008 and
probably slightly less in 2009 due to the economic downturn.
 ""About 60 percent of that money is sent through informal
channels or mules. That is quite a lot,"" he said.
 Bureaucratic requirements in the United States, a lack of
competition for services and a charge on foreign exchange
charge levied by Cuba on transferred dollars make formal money
transfers through financial agencies like Western Union
costly.
 UNDERGROUND FINANCE
 Formal transfers cost 17 percent of the money sent, whereas
mules cost around 13 percent, says Orozco, adding they deliver
the money much faster.
 The mules are part of an emerging underground industry of
financial services offering credit and installment payments
otherwise unthinkable in Cuba's state-run economy.
 There are no figures available for the size of the informal
trade in goods, but it has become quite organized. There are
even privately run places in Havana where Cubans can shop from
catalogues sent by email. They pick an item, make a 50 percent
down payment and 15 days later they get their order. All for a
25 percent commission.
 Most of these informal businesses are family-run. A Havana
resident, for example, sends a list of products to a relative
in Miami, who then finds a Cuban American willing to transport
them as a mule in exchange for a free ticket.
 Cubans are crazy for big brands, says Diana, who sends
items from Miami to Havana. ""They ask me for instance to send
sunglasses that say Dolce & Gabbana or Gucci. They're cheap
replicas, of course, but they sell very well because of the
brands. Cubans love that,"" she explained.
 Profit margins are striking when it comes to high-end
electronics. A flat screen TV bought in Miami for $700 can be
sold in Cuba for up to $2,000. Such a television would likely
cost $2,500 in a state store, if it were available.
 The informal trade also feeds an endless network of
informal vendors who receive small commissions.
 But the ""mule"" business is not without risks.
 ""You need to be careful and make sure you don't bring too
many of the same products, because Cuban customs officers are
not stupid and if they realize it is for sale they will take it
away on the spot,"" said Yanet.

 * Kazakhs unable to breach the gap
 * USDA report expected to estimate lower global output
 
 By Natalia Zinets and Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Ukraine is considering grain export
curbs due to fears of a domestic food shortage, hot on the heels
of a ban by drought-stricken Russia, a key wheat supplier, while
big producer Kazakhstan is unlikely to be able to fill the gap.
 Ukraine, the world's No 1 exporter of barley and
sixth-largest of wheat, said on Wednesday it would make a final
decision on export quotas next week after severe winter frosts
and a scorching summer heatwave ruined tracts of its crops.
 Although the quotas are likely to be small, the announcement
could rattle grain markets already jittery after Russia,
suffering the worst drought in 130 years, announced an export
ban, helping global wheat prices soar to two-year highs. Prices
have since retreated, but remain volatile.
 ""If quotas are imposed it would be on wheat,"" Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk told a news conference, but later
said maize and other cereals could also be affected.
 ""The first quota proposal could be 7 to 8 million tonnes.
This is for all grains. The final volume of quotas could be
after maize harvesting,"" he said. Ukraine is among the world's
top five exporters of maize.
 U.S. wheat futures rose on Wednesday, breaking a
three-session losing streak, but trading remained nervous ahead
of a key U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report on
Thursday that is expected to estimate lower global output after
Black Sea crop damage.
 The drought that has decimated crops in eastern Europe shows
no sign of respite, with a senior Russian weather official
predicting on Tuesday that the heat in most parts of European
Russia is likely to continue over the next 10 days.
 ""The global grain markets remain very nervous and any
further hot and dry conditions in Russia continue to unsettle
the market,"" said Garry Booth, a trader with MF Global
Australia.
 
 SCRAMBLE
 The Russian ban has left end users scrambling for grain from
other suppliers, including the United States. Private exporters
reported the sale of 120,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat, mainly to
China and Egypt, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on
Tuesday.
 While drought has not affected Kazakhstan to the same extent
as Russia, it is unlikely to fill the gap left by Russia's
export ban.
 A lower harvest in the country, one of the world's top 10
wheat exporters, will reduce its surplus and world prices are
too low to justify high transport costs, Nurlan Tleubayev,
president of the Grain Union of Kazakhstanan industry official
told Reuters. ""The most important thing is the price. If
traders cannot offer a price higher than that offered by Tajik
flour mills, then why supply across Russian territory to the
Black and Baltic Seas?"" Tleubayev told Reuters in an interview.
 Kazakhstan's membership of a three-state Customs Union with
Russia and Belarus has led to speculation it may follow Moscow
in banning grain exports, an issue that will be discussed at a
meeting of the union commission on Aug. 17-18.

 By Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble fell to its
lowest in over two weeks against the dollar on Wednesday,
shrugging off signs of a pick up in domestic inflation and
taking its cues instead from the retreat in global oil prices.
 The rouble eased to 30.30 per dollar, its weakest since late
July, before closing at 30.29  -- down nearly 2
percent since the start of the week.
 ""Equity markets are correcting and oil is going down, and
all that is pressuring the market,"" said Vladimir Demishev,
trader at Troika Dialog, adding that for now he saw no impact on
market direction from the heatwave or the drought.
 Weekly inflation doubled to 0.2 percent as Russians stocked
up on long-life goods in expectation that a drought -- caused by
the worst heatwave on record -- will push up food prices.
[ID:nMSC000035]
 Many analysts -- including Goldman Sachs [ID:nLDE67A0XX],
Citi [ID:nLDE67A0XX] and Russia's VTB Capital -- expect that
inflationary pressures will prompt the central bank to allow
greater currency appreciation in the medium term.
 But for now, investors are shrugging off the impact of the
drought, with the rouble firmly linked to its long-time driver,
oil prices, which dipped below $80 [O/R].
 The correlation between the rouble/dollar rate and oil -- a
key export for Russia -- has risen to its highest levels since
late May this month, at around 80 percent.
 ""We effectively have barrel-trading - we continue to depend
on the oil price,"" said Viktor Anisimov, dealer at Alba
Alliance.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The heat and the toxic smoke from forest fires, which have
enveloped Moscow in recent weeks, have dampened activity on
stock and bond markets as traders and investors flee the
capital.
 But on the currency market -- where clients include
corporates having to meet real obligations in addition to
speculators, daily volumes have remained around the normal range
of $2.5-3.5 billion a day in dollar/rouble on the MICEX exchange
-- and topped $4 billion on Wednesday.
The Russian currency fell 8 kopecks against the dollar-euro
basket the central bank uses for guiding the rouble's nominal
exchange rate, to close at 34.37 .
 Another down side for the rouble were worries about the
health of the global economy, and thus the prospects for demand
for Russian exports after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday
moved to counter a weakening U.S. recovery by pledging to buy
more government debt. [ID:nN09275781]
 Against a broadly weaker euro, the rouble edged up to 39.36

 WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened
a surprising 18.8 percent in June on a surge of consumer goods
from China and other suppliers, suggesting U.S. second-quarter
economic growth was much weaker than previously thought.
 The monthly trade gap totaled $49.9 billion, the highest
since October 2008, the Commerce Department reported on
Wednesday, as U.S. exports stumbled a bit.
 The deficit was wider than any of the 67 Wall Street
forecasts collected before the report, and is likely to prompt
analysts to ratchet down estimates of second-quarter gross
domestic product growth.
 ""The strength in imports, though hinting at some pickup in
consumer spending, continues to undermine GDP growth. Moreover,
the slowing in exports will only fan fears of a faltering U.S.
recovery,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital
Markets.
 Many economists have already trimmed their estimates on signs
business inventories had risen more slowly than the government
first thought. In its first estimate of GDP growth late last
month, the Commerce Department had said the economy grew at a 2.4
percent annual rate in the April to June period.
 U.S. imports of goods and services grew 3 percent in June to
$200.3 billion, the highest since October 2008, in a show of
strengthening domestic demand. Imports of consumer goods hit a
record $43.1 billion and imports of non-petroleum goods were the
highest since August 2008.
Imports from China soared to $32.9 billion, the highest since
October 2008.
The closely watched U.S trade deficit with the East Asian
manufacturer widened to $26.2 billion, also the highest since
October 2008, while U.S. exports to China fell slightly.
The big jump in the U.S. trade deficit follows Chinese
government data on Tuesday that showed China's trade surplus
surged to $28.7 billion in July, an 18-month high.
The trade data had little impact on U.S. financial markets.
U.S. stock index futures were lower on Wednesday as weak Chinese
manufacturing data and a gloomier U.S. economic outlook from the
Federal Reserve led to mounting concerns about the health of the
global economy.
The dollar hit a 15-year low against the yen.
The trade data is likely to intensify calls in the U.S.
Congress for China to move more aggressively to raise the value
of its currency against the dollar.
 China loosened the yuan from a nearly two-year peg to the
dollar in June, but it has barely risen since then. Many
lawmakers believe it is undervalued by at least 25 percent.
 U.S. imports from Germany and the 27-nation European Union
also had their best showing since October 2008.
 Overall U.S. exports fell 1.3 percent in June to $150.5
billion, the biggest month-to-month drop since April 2009.
 U.S automotive exports were the highest since October 2008,
but other important categories like capital goods, industrial
supplies and materials and food, feeds and beverages posted
declines.
 A second report showed U.S. home loan demand climbed last
week but record low mortgage rates failed to light a fire in a
market constrained by unemployment and tight lending practices.
Mortgage purchase and refinancing applications rose less than
1 percent in the first week of August, even as 30-year loan rates
fell to 4.57 percent, the lowest in 20 years of record keeping by
the Mortgage Bankers Association.

 * Emerging banks less leveraged, more traditional 
 
 By Sujata Rao and Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Emerging market banks, buoyed by
robust domestic growth and stress-tested by their own crises a
decade ago, could offer investors a viable alternative to
Western banks facing headwinds.
 Lenders in countries ranging from Brazil to Indonesia are
arguably in better shape than their western countertparts, and
signs are that investors may increasingly look to them to fill
their allocations for financials.
 ""Most EM banks are unlikely to see the stresses you see in
Europe and essentially that is because they saw them already in
the past,"" says Gabriel Wallach, chief investment officer for
BNP Paribas' 48-billion-euro emerging equity portfolio.
 ""If you are a global investor you did well if you were
overweight EM financials during the crisis. I would continue to
overweight them now, relative to developed market banks, because
of their capital ratios and growth prospects,"" Wallach added.
 Russia's biggest lender Sberbank, for example, trades at a
2011 price-book of 1.6, with 2011 return-on-equity forecast at
21.5 percent, according to estimates by UBS.
 Compare that with European banks. They may be trading much
cheaper at an average P/B of 0.9 but ROE is also much lower at
11.4 percent. Spanish bank Santander, for example, has a 2011
P/B of 1.0 and ROE of 11.7 percent. 
 Western banks have posted forecast-beating results and
passed sector-wide stress tests, but must contend with more
regulatory scrutiny, anaemic economies and the need to refinance
maturing debt.
 Emerging banks, on the other hand, are poised to gain from
fast economic growth in developing countries. High savings rates
and rising bank penetration mean many big EM banks are seeing
loans and deposits growing a sharp 15-20 percent a year.

Table on loan ratios and return on equity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ And EM banks' loan-deposit ratios are a healthy 70-80
percent, meaning they can easily fund loans from their deposits.
 European banks' loan growth is seen around 5 percent this
year but because of the population's low savings level, their
loan-to-deposit ratios are a whopping 130 percent.
 
 SHARES OUTPACE WESTERN RIVALS
 Investors are taking note. 
 The MSCI emerging financials index is at a two-year high, up
3 percent in 2010, while global financials are down 2 percent on
the year.
 UBS analysts recommend staying underweight European banks
and told clients in a recent note: ""(We) prefer banks in
emerging markets...that are better capitalised with strong
deposit platforms and superior growth prospects.""
 They predict emerging banks' return on equity -- profits
generated on shareholders' investments -- at almost 20 percent
by 2012, double the ROE forecast for developed world banks.
 Their top EM picks included Sberbank, Turkish Akbank, Banco
do Brasil, India's Punjab National Bank and also HSBC which
derives much of its revenue from the developing world.
 BNP's Wallach picked Indian, Indonesian and Brazilian banks
as his favourites, citing ""super growth and high returns.""
To be sure, not all emerging banks look great -- Hungarian
banks, for instance, are unlikely to be on anyone's best-buy
lists due to their overexposure to foreign currency loans.
 South African and Korean banks' loans outstrip deposits,
just as in Europe. Bad loans at state-run Chinese banks may rise
after the recent lending spurt as the economy slows.
 But on most metrics, whether loans, deposit growth, return
on equity, or debt levels, emerging banks look attractive. 
 
 FUNCTIONING LIKE BANKS
 Developing world banks for the most part function like
traditional banks, taking deposits and using the cash to lend.
U.S. and European banks rely more than emerging market banks do
on wholesale borrowing to raise funds.
 They must soon start raising cash to repay the debt. Moody's
says $5 trillion in bank debt will mature in 2010-2012 -- $3
trillion of that in Europe -- at a time when euro zone and U.S.
governments will also be rolling over vast quantities of bonds.
 ""You do not see the same kind of leverage of the system (in
emerging banks) which left banks vulnerable to needing funds
from other banks,"" said Phil Poole, head of macro and investment
strategy at HSBC Asset Management in London.
 A legacy of past financial crises and banking sector
collapses is that emerging market bank capital adequacy ratios
-- the amount of capital deemed necessary to absorb sudden
shocks -- tend to be well above the 6 percent stipulated in the
recent European stress tests.
 Hungarian bank OTP came in at 16.2 percent, for example, and
in countries such as Brazil, capital cushions are up to 18
percent.
 ""Having been burnt 10 years back, few emerging market banks
have been affected (by the crisis) this time. EM regulators have
operated in environments where they have always assumed stress
might come,"" says James Syme, who runs $1.2 billion in emerging
equities at Barings and is overweight the banking sector.
 Syme names Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil as examples of
countries where banks underwent a total transformation since the
devastating emerging market crises between 1997 and 2002.
 These relatively higher capital ratios should give emerging
banks an edge when new sector regulations come in as the Basel
III global banking regulations expected by end-2010, will almost
certainly force banks to substantially raise capital buffers.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 08:36AM ET</span>",US trade gap widens sharply in June," WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit
widened a surprising 18.8 percent in June on a surge of
consumer goods from China and other suppliers, while U.S.
exports fell, a government report showed on Wednesday.
 The monthly trade gap totaled $49.9 billion, the highest
since October 2008. The deficit was wider than any of the 67
Wall Street forecasts collected before the report.
 U.S. imports of goods and services grew 3 percent in June
to $200.3 billion, the highest since October 2008, in a show of
strengthening domestic demand. Imports of consumer goods hit a
record $43.1 billion and imports of non-petroleum goods were
the highest since August 2008.
Imports from China soared to $32.9 billion, the highest
since October 2008.
The closely watched U.S trade deficit with the East Asian
manufacturer widened to $26.2 billion, also the highest since
October 2008, while U.S. exports to China fell slightly.
The big jump in the U.S. trade deficit follows Chinese
government data on Tuesday that showed China's trade surplus
surged to $28.7 billion in July, an 18-month high.
 The desperate trade data is likely to intensify calls in
the U.S. Congress for China to move more aggressively to raise
the value of its currency against the dollar.
 China loosened the yuan from a nearly two-year peg to the
dollar in June, but it has barely risen since then. Many
lawmakers believe it is undervalued by at least 25 percent.
 U.S. imports from Germany and the 27-nation European Union
also had their best showing since October 2008.
 Overall U.S. exports fell 1.3 percent in June to $150.5
billion, their worst showing since April 2009.
U.S automotive exports were the highest since October 2008,
but other important categories like capital goods, industrial
supplies and materials and food, feeds and beverages posted
declines.

 By Michael Hogan
 HAMBURG, Aug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures rose on
Wednesday, breaking a three-session losing streak, ahead of a
key U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report expected to
estimate lower global output after Black Sea crop damage.
 ""People have taken positions ahead of the USDA report but
some early day gains were given up because of profit-taking,""
one trader said.
 U.S. wheat rose 2 percent on Wednesday in the Asian session,
but gave up some of the early gains as trading remained nervous,
with traders citing some adjustments ahead of Thursday's world
crop report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 ""The funds are booking some profits before the USDA report,""
one French dealer said.
 On Wednesday, CBOT wheat for September delivery was up 0.2
percent to $696-1/4 per bushel by 1117 GMT after sliding 2.5
percent in the previous session.
 Chicago Board of Trade wheat futures are up 66 percent from
the June low of $4.25-½ a bushel despite losses since the market
fell from a two-year peak on Friday.
 Paris wheat futures were lower on Wednesday as the French
market continued to track U.S. prices as the two origins vie for
knock-on demand created by Russia's export ban.
 The French market was awaiting results of tenders issued by
Egypt and Algeria to see whether French wheat would secure more
business after a 240,000-tonne sale to Egypt last weekend.
 Paris benchmark November milling wheat on Euronext fell 0.5
euros to 206.50 euros a tonne by 1117 GMT, with the market
testing support at 205 euros ahead of a major threshold at 200
euros.
 Reaction to news from Ukraine, where the government is due
to decide on Wednesday whether to introduce export quotas, was
muted with dwindling exports from both Ukraine and Kakazhstan
already anticipated.
 ""It's gone from being informal news to official news,"" the
dealer said of potential export curbs in Ukraine.
 
 NERVOUS MARKETS
 The drought in eastern Europe -- which has boosted U.S.
wheat futures since the end of June -- shows no sign of respite,
with a senior Russian weather official predicting on Tuesday
that the heat in most parts of European Russia is likely to
continue over the next 10 days.
 ""The global grain markets remain very nervous and any
further hot and dry conditions in Russia continue to unsettle
the market,"" said Garry Booth, a trader with MF Global
Australia. ""Export numbers coming out of the U.S. have been a
good surprise.""
 Private exporters reported the sale of 120,000 tonnes of
U.S. wheat, mainly to China and Egypt, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said on Tuesday.
 China's National Bureau of Statistics warned lower global
wheat output could translate into inflationary pressure for the
world's top producer and consumer of the grain.
 Analysts were expecting the USDA's forecasts for U.S. wheat,
corn and soybean production to rise when it releases its monthly
estimate at 1230 GMT on Thursday.
 But U.S. ending stocks were seen falling as global crop woes
will force end users to look to the United States to satisfy
their supply needs.
 U.S. corn and soybean prices were little changed.
 CBOT September corn was down 0.1 percent at $3.93 a bushel
and August soybeans were up a marginal 0.2 percent to $10.39-1/4
a bushel.
 Soybeans and corn futures, which have been tracking gains
in the wheat market, remain under pressure from expectations of
large crops in the United States.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a 15-year low
against the yen on Wednesday as steps taken by the Federal
Reserve to revive a faltering U.S. economy pushed U.S. Treasury
yields lower.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Wednesday
that he was closely watching forex markets [ID:nTKX006931], but
analysts doubted his rhetoric would escalate into currency
intervention to weaken the yen.
 ""Japan needs the support of the U.S. and Europe to
intervene, but the Fed and the European Central Bank are focused
on other problems right now so I don't think it is possible at
these levels,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency analyst at UBS in
Zurich.
 The dollar dropped to 84.72 yen  on trading platform
EBS, after taking out option barriers at 85.00 and 84.75, in a
move fuelled by U.S. two-year Treasury yields hitting a record
low. [US/]
 ""I see no upside for dollar/yen right now and I can see it
falling towards 80 yen,"" said Oliveri.
 The record low in dollar/yen was hit in April 1995 around
79.75 yen.
 In a move to reinvigorate a weakening economic recovery, the
Fed said on Tuesday it would use cash from maturing mortgage
bonds it holds to buy more government debt to help pin down
borrowing costs. [ID:nN09275781]
 The move strengthened expectations that U.S. interest rates
would stay at record lows, driving U.S. two-year yields to a
record low and narrowing the spread over Japanese two-year
yields, which pushed the dollar down against the yen.
 ""The fall in U.S. yields is a barometer of the cyclical
position of the U.S. economy,"" said Adam Cole, currency
strategist at RBC.
 ""The market's reaction is that if the U.S. economy is
slowing materially it will not be in isolation and it has
therefore responded by selling risk instead of selling the
dollar, which is positive for the yen.""
 
 SHARES FALL
 The dollar rose against other currencies as investors pared
back their exposure to risk, pushing the U.S. unit up 1 percent
against a basket of currencies as European shares <.FTEU3> fell
1.2 percent.
 At 1146 GMT the dollar had gained more than 1 percent to
81.645 <.DXY>, its strongest since late July, as the euro 
lost 1.3 percent to $1.3000 and the Australian dollar 
slid 1.2 percent to $0.9030. 
 The yen gained across the board, with the euro down more
than 2 percent  and the Aussie  losing 1.7
percent as equity market falls encouraged investors to shun risk
in favour of the low-yielding Japanese currency.
 Elsewhere, sterling fell more than 1 percent against the
dollar  after the Bank of England said UK inflation
would fall well below its 2 percent target in two years even if
interest rates stay low. [nKING]

 * Iran gas pipeline to feed European demand
 
 (Adds Tupras comments, background paras 6-8)
 By Orhan Coskun
 ANKARA, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Turkey will support petrol sales
by Turkish companies to Iran, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz told
Reuters on Wednesday, despite U.S. sanctions that aim to squeeze
the Islamic Republic's fuel imports.
 The pledge came ahead of an expected resumption of talks
next month between world powers and Tehran on the Iranian
nuclear programme, which Washington suspects aims to develop
atomic weapons.
 ""If the preference of the private sector is to sell these
(petroleum) products to Iran, we will help them. There is no
demand for Turkey to halt the trade of these products with
Iran,"" Yildiz said in an interview.
 The sale of petrol, as well as other projects Turkey is
planning with Iran, may indicate a shift in its energy policy to
give priority to its energy-rich neighbours in the Middle East
over conditions set by its traditional Western allies.
 Any firms that sell gasoline to Iran could face retribution
including a possible ban from accessing the U.S. financial
system or denial of U.S. contracts, according to a document from
the U.S. Treasury.
 Tupras, Turkey's sole refiner and gasoline exporter which is
owned by Koc Holding, declined to say whether the company had
sold anything to Iran. The refiner
buys 33 percent of its crude from the Islamic Republic, however.
 A Tupras official said, ""For us, Iran is more important than
America, because we get crude oil from them. We don't get
anything from America.""
 
 GASOLINE SALES
 Although Iran is the world's fifth-largest crude exporter,
it has to import around 40 percent of its gasoline needs because
it does not have enough domestic refining capacity.
 Yildiz said plans by Turkey and Iran for joint construction
of power plants with a total capacity of 6,000 megawatts would
continue, giving the two countries enough capacity to feed their
own markets as well as other countries in the Middle East.
 A planned natural gas pipeline from the Islamic Republic to
Turkey by private Turkish company SOM Petrol will be used to
supply European gas markets as well Turkey's demands, the
minister said.
 Turkey, which is a NATO member and European Union member
candidate, has seen its capital rise sharply in the Muslim
Middle East since Ankara's vocal condemnation of the killings of
nine pro-Palestinian activists aboard a Gaza-bound aide ship.
 Ankara has recently drawn closer to Tehran. Together with
Brazil, it brokered a nuclear fuel swap in May in the hopes that
the deal would draw Iran and major powers back to the
negotiating table.
 Iran, which says its nuclear programme is for peaceful
purposes, gave an assurance that it would stop enriching uranium
to 20 percent purity if world powers agreed to the proposed
swap, but their response was lukewarm.
 Since June, the U.N. Security Council, the United States,
and the European Union have imposed additional sanctions that
have increased the pressure on Tehran.
 Turkey's gasoline sales to Iran dropped 73 percent in July
to $25.55 million as the sanctions came into force. Sales were
the equivalent of one cargo, according to Reuters calculations.
.
 Russian oil giant LUKOIL has also resumed gasoline sales
into Iran in partnership with China's state-run firm Zhuhai
Zhenrong..

 * Egyptian pound shows signs of bottoming out
 * But uncertainty over currency trend deters NDF trade
 
 By Patrick Werr and Tom Pfeiffer
 CAIRO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Foreign investors are moving back
into Egyptian Treasury bills, pushing yields lower, in the hope
that the Egyptian pound has finally bottomed out and may
appreciate in coming weeks or months.
 The average yield on 91-day T-bills  sank to 9.501
percent on Sunday, its lowest level in more than two years. The
yield peaked at 10.179 percent in late June, when investors were
fleeing risk during the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.
 Foreign investors have poured about $1.5 billion into
Egyptian T-bills in the past three weeks, a considerable
acceleration from previous months, estimated a London-based
analyst who asked not to be identified.
 That amount would account for nearly a third of the 24.5
billion Egyptian pounds ($4.3 billion) of T-bills with
maturities of up to 364 days auctioned since July 22. Complete,
up-to-date figures for foreign buying of Egyptian debt are not
available.
 In contrast to Egyptian Treasury bonds, which not very
liquid, there is a lively secondary market in T-bills, which
limits risk for foreign investors.
 One reason for the renewed interest in short-term Egyptian
debt is a return of appetite for high-yield, high-risk
instruments among global investors as the euro zone crisis has
eased over the last several weeks.
 
 CURRENCY TREND
 Another, related reason is a partial rebound of the Egyptian
pound. After sliding from a peak of 5.40 against the U.S. dollar
in January this year to 5.70 in late July, the pound  has
bounced slightly off technical support at 5.70, the March 2009
low. It hit a high of 5.66 at the end of last week.
 Technically, the pound also shows signs of having ended a
shorter-term downtrend against the euro ; now at 7.40,
it broke this week above its downtrend channel from early June
as 14-day momentum showed a positive divergence.
 When the dollar strengthened during the euro zone crisis,
Egypt allowed its currency to weaken against the dollar and the
currencies of its main trading partners.
 Analysts say the Egyptian pound could now rise in coming
months as the government seeks to offset the effect of rising
world commodity prices, particularly the price of wheat, which
has surged because of Russia's drought. Egypt is a major wheat
importer.
 ""In the last six months the central bank has been
deliberately weakening the currency, so it might abandon this
policy,"" said Shahin Vallee, head of emerging market foreign
exchange strategy at BNP Paribas in London.
 Vallee said heavy foreign interest in Egyptian T-bills came
after markets started betting that world food prices were on the
rise and that the central bank would let the Egyptian pound
appreciate.
 ""People like the Egypt macro story,"" a London-based trader
said on condition of anonymity. ""They believe that we've had
depreciation. We're at a turning point in the FX. You've got a
lot of people jumping in the trade.""
 Egypt's economy grew 5.3 percent in the fiscal year to the
end of June, accelerating from 4.7 percent in the previous 12
months, according to government data. The government has
forecast growth of at least 6.5 percent this fiscal year.
 ""This indicates a near full recovery from the global crisis
and a return to the path of rapid economic growth similar to the
period before the global crisis,"" Economic Development Minister
Osman Mohamed Osman said late last month. [ID:nLDE66R1RM]
 Tighter monetary policy might conceivably support
appreciation of the Egyptian pound toward the end of this year.
Vallee said a major, further fall in government debt yields was
unlikely as the central bank could begin leaning toward raising
benchmark interest rates as 2010 draws to a close.
 Urban consumer inflation in Egypt  was steady at
10.7 percent in the 12 months to July, the state-run CAPMAS
statistics agency said on Tuesday, but prices jumped on a
monthly basis. [ID:nLDE6781LL]
 A 38.2 percent retracement of the Egyptian pound's fall
against the dollar since January this year -- a reasonable
minimum expectation if the Egyptian currency has indeed ended
its downtrend -- would bring it to 5.59.
 
 NDFS
 Given how small the pound's rebound has been so far,
however, some traders will want to wait for clearer signs that
the currency has bottomed before betting on appreciation.
 A fall of emerging market currencies on Wednesday, on
concern about a faltering U.S. economic recovery after a
pessimistic assessment by the U.S. Federal Reserve, suggested
confidence remained fairly fragile. [ID:nLDE67A0XB]
 Another analyst said, ""Fundamentals support more
appreciation (of the Egyptian pound), but it is not happening
for the moment.""
 One market which has failed to revive along with Egyptian
T-bills is Egyptian pound non-deliverable forwards, which are
contracts for notional currency trades settled on future dates.
 The NDF market boomed late last year, with traders
estimating notional turnover of between $100 million and $200
million on some days, as NDFs were used to speculate.
 Turnover shrank this year as buyers fled risk because of the
euro zone crisis, and volume remains modest, partly because of
uncertainty about the trend in the spot market, traders said.
 ""Most of the interest now is in the actual onshore cash
market,"" said a London-based currency trader. ""There's always
little bits and pieces going on, but the main investments
happening now are real-money accounts.""
 The trader added, ""When spot moves so violently, people
don't know what to do -- they tend to sit on their hands"" (in
the NDF market) a bit and not do too much.""

 By Sumeet Desai and David Milliken
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The Bank of England left the door
open on Wednesday for more monetary easing, cutting its forecast
for UK economic growth and predicting that inflation would fall
well below its 2 percent target in two years.
 A day after the Federal Reserve downgraded its outlook for
the United States, the BoE's quarterly Inflation Report -- the
first since a harsh government budget in June -- showed it too
is worried about the durability of the recovery.
 ""Business and consumer sentiment have shown signs of
softening, measures of financial fragility remain elevated and
there is great uncertainty about the outlook for both the United
States and our most important trading partner, the euro area,""
Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told a news conference.
 Ten-year gilt yields  slid to a 16-month low
below 3.12 percent and sterling hit a one-week low below $1.57
 as investors bet the BoE could restart its asset-buying,
or quantitative easing, programme which pumped its 200 billion
pounds ($314 billion) into the economy before being put on hold
early this year.
 The BoE said it stood ready to move policy in either
direction and noted the outlook for inflation was ""highly
uncertain"".
 Most analysts expect the QE programme to remain on hold and
rates to stay at their record low of 0.5 percent for many more
months to come. But few are certain.
 ""It may take a more obvious slowdown in the economy to
prompt the majority of MPC members to vote for a further bout of
quantitative easing. But that may well materialise,"" said
Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics.
 ""And if nothing else, there is further support here for our
long-held view that interest rates are going nowhere for a long
time.""
 
 STUBBORN INFLATION
 The BoE forecast CPI inflation would fall to around 1.4
percent in two years. But that was not before remaining well
above the target all through next year, a big upward revision to
the forecast it made in May.
 King blamed this mostly on a rise in value-added tax due to
come in at the start of next year but inflation -- currently at
3.2 percent -- has repeatedly surprised on the upside and has
been above target for much of the last three years.
 ""That does not mean the Monetary Policy Committee has taken
its eye off the inflation ball, nor has gone soft on inflation.
We have not. Rather, it is the consequence of a series of
one-off price shocks,"" King said.
 He said there was yet little sign that above-target
inflation had boosted people's expectations of further price
rises but that the MPC would be watching this carefully.
 At least one MPC member, however, has been calling for
interest rates to rise. Andrew Sentance voted to raise rates by
a quarter-point in both June and July and probably this month as
well though minutes of last week's meeting are not out yet.
 For now, Sentance appears to be in the minority and the bias
appears toward further easing. The economy grew by 1.1 percent
in the three months to June but output still remains well below
the levels before the credit crisis.
 That Q2 figure might also prove the high-water mark given
finance minister George Osborne announced the harshest budget in
a generation in June. Most government departments will have
their budgets slashed by a quarter over the next four years,
potentially putting hundreds of thousands out of work.
 Taxes are set to go up too, putting a further dent in
consumer spending power. Recent surveys show confidence already
faltering and the housing market starting to come down again,
particularly as credit is still no longer plentiful as it was
before the crash.
 ""We think that if the MPC witnesses further deceleration in
the pace of recovery it will be tempted to ease policy further,
engaging in further quantitative easing and boosting its asset
purchases,"" said David Page, economist at Investec. 
 ""And we suspect that if necessary such an
easing could occur before November's Inflation Report.""

909,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 06:44AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Japan debt is safer than U.S. debt - China economist," * China government economist: yen to strengthen further
 * Says Japanese debt market is more stable
 * Fed's buying of Treasuries seen as supportive of growth
 (Adds comment about Federal Reserve)
 BEIJING, Aug 11 (Reuters) - China has been buying record
amounts of Japanese government debt because it is less risky
than U.S. debt, at least in the short term, a Chinese
government economist said on Wednesday.
 Investing in Japanese bonds is safer because so much of the
country's debt is held domestically and the yen is on course to
strengthen further, said Zhang Ming, an economist with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think
tank.
 ""Even though the difference in yields is big, China has
been abandoning U.S. debt and picking up Japanese debt. This
definitely shows that it believes the risks of U.S. debt far
exceed those of Japanese debt,"" Zhang said in a report issued
by his research institute.
 The report was issued a day after the Federal Reserve said
it would buy more U.S. government debt in a form of mild
quantitative easing to counter economic weakness.
 Top Chinese leaders have previously registered their
concerns about lax U.S. fiscal policies eroding the value of
their investments in the United States.
 A source familiar with China's strategy for investing its
foreign exchange reserves said the Fed's decision might, in
fact, be well received in Beijing.
 ""The purpose for the Fed in buying Treasuries is to support
U.S. economic growth, which is positive,"" he said.
 Chinese net acquisition of Japanese debt in 2010 has
reached more than 1.7 trillion yen ($19.9 billion), already far
surpassing its record of 255.7 billion in 2005. For a story,
see [ID:nTOE67802Z]
 At the same time, China has pared back its vast holdings of
U.S. debt, from $894.8 billion at the start of this year to
$867.7 billion in May, according to the most recent data.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield  set a new
record low of 0.493 percent on Wednesday after the Fed
downgraded its assessment of the U.S. economic recovery and
said it would resume purchases of government debt.
 Japan's two-year notes are yielding around 0.135 percent,
but all eyes are on the yen, which is nearing a 15-year high
against the ailing dollar. The yen has gained nearly 9 percent
on the greenback this year after a spare of weak U.S. economic
reports sent investors scurrying to less risky assets. [FRX/]
 SEEKING LIQUID, SAFE ASSETS
 China has long said that it wants to diversify its foreign
exchange reserves, the biggest in the world at $2.45 trillion.
Analysts estimate that about two-thirds are invested in
dollar-denominated assets.
 Along with diversification, China's reserve managers say
they want to invest in liquid and safe assets and earn a
reasonable return.
 Japanese debt is a good choice for now on all of these
counts, Zhang said.
 Foreigners hold a third of U.S. debt but only 5 percent of
Japanese debt, making the Japanese market structure more
stable, he said.
 Moreover, Japan's current account surplus and the unwinding
of yen carry trades put on before the global financial crisis
should continue to push the yen  up in the short term, he
added.
 But Zhang stopped short of calling this a decisive shift in
China's foreign exchange investment strategy.
 ""The yield on holding Japanese debt is very low, and Japan
has a series of systemic problems -- an ageing population, high
government debt, a liquidity trap -- which influence the mid-
to long-term sustainability of Japan's debt,"" he said.
 ""Whether China can continue to invest in Japanese debt,
that will require closer observation,"" he said.
 Zhang also pointed out that China had not turned its back
on the United States. While it cut about $161 billion of its
short-term U.S. debt holdings in the 10 months to May, it
actually added $88.5 billion of longer-term debt.
 The fundamental problem is that China should not be in a
situation where its must buy either U.S. or Japanese debt, he
said.
 ""The choice between Japanese and U.S. debt is not a choice
between good and bad. Rather, it is being compelled to pick
between bad and worse,"" he said.
 If China slowed its accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves by working to cut its trade surplus and allowing its
exchange rate to appreciate, it would not need to invest so
much in foreign debt.
 ""This is the only way to get at the root of the problem,""
he said.

910,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 06:32AM ET</span>",GREECE-TAX/ =3," If Greeks are to rekindle an ancient sense of civic
responsibility, the government will have to convince people that
it can deliver better services and has really changed itself.
 So far, it's off to a rocky start. In May, tourism minister
Angela Gerekou stepped down after press reports that her husband
Tolis Voskopoulos, a prominent singer, owed the government more
than 5 million euros in taxes. Soon after, revelations about
property deals carried out by a Socialist former deputy prime
minister through offshore companies put the spotlight on
loopholes that are still open to exploitation.
 A scandal involving German company Siemens and officials
from both of Greece's main political parties also cast a cloud
over the government's credibility. Siemens ended one of the
biggest corporate corruption investigations in history in 2008,
when it agreed to pay about 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) in
fines and penalties as a result of U.S. and German
investigations into bribes it paid to win contracts globally,
including Greece. High-ranking Greek party officials admitted to
prosecutors that they had received funds.
 ""Greeks initially bought the line that they were to blame
for the crisis, even public servants felt guilt,"" says Bratsis.
""They believe it less and less, as the financial pain kicks in
and because of scandals like the bribes-for-contracts affair
involving Siemens.""
 Protesters angry at corrupt politicians and businessmen have
repeatedly stormed parliament in recent months, demanding
punishment for those they blame for the crisis. Analysts say
social peace in the face of austerity will partly hinge on the
government being able to prosecute some high-profile case of
graft and tax dodging.
 Tax official Tsoukas warns that Athens could lose the battle
for hearts and minds if more scandals emerge. ""The young had
started thinking differently and these latest events have
disappointed them,"" he says. ""They ask, if I pay, will my money
go to some politician's villa?""
 Not if it's up to the tax inspector dressed in pink and her
team. ""They really could never pay us enough for what we do, the
hours we put in, the pressure we are under,"" she said, still at
her computer. ""But it's all worth it when I see a case go to
prosecutors.""

912,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 06:00AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-BoE inflation report suggests scope for policy easing," (Adds market reaction)
 By Sumeet Desai and David Milliken
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - British inflation will fall well
below its 2 percent target in two years, even if interest rates
remain at record lows, the Bank of England said on Wednesday,
leaving scope for further policy easing if the economy worsens.
 The BoE noted that the prospects were ""highly uncertain"" and
it was ready to move policy in either direction, but the central
bank's August Inflation Report is likely to reinforce analysts'
expectations that interest rates will stay at a record low of
0.5 percent for some time to come.
 In its August Inflation Report, the central bank sharply
revised up its 2011 inflation forecasts but said price growth
would slow rapidly to around 1.4 percent the following year when
a Jan. 1 2011 increase in value-added tax drops out of annual
comparisons.
 This end-point was broadly similar to the two-year forecast
in May's Inflation Report.
 Growth is expected to be slower -- seen at a rate of just
over 3 percent in two years time -- because of the extra fiscal
tightening announced in the government's June budget, weaker
business and consumer sentiment and credit conditions remaining
tighter than the central bank had expected.
 ""Looking ahead, the UK economy is facing a major rebalancing
away from private and public consumption and towards net
exports. Achieving that rebalancing, while confronting these
headwinds, is likely to mean a choppy recovery,"" King told a
news conference.
 In May, the central bank had predicted growth of around 3.6
percent at its two year forecasting horizon.
 Ten-year gilt yields  fell to a fresh 16-month
low and sterling dropped against the euro  after the
release of the report, as investors bet that more monetary
easing was possible.
 Late on Tuesday the Federal Reserve gave a sombre assessment
of the U.S. economic outlook and said it would reinvest the
proceeds from its mortgage-backed securities portfolio into U.S.
government bonds.
 ""I think the policy measures they announced yesterday were
ones that were much more designed to maintain the stance of
policy to avoid an inadvertent tightening of policy,"" King said.
""I interpret that as largely being to try to maintain the
relatively easy stance of policy they've adopted.""
 The BoE left interest rates at a record low of 2 percent
last week and maintained its 200 billion pounds ($315 billion)
quantitative easing programme which had pumped money into the
economy.
 ""With the GDP downgrade it looks like in the short term the
policy bias is probably towards further QE ... but on balance we
still think there will be no change,"" said David Page, economist
at Investec.

 * Pressure mounts on government to reach a deal
 
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 11 (Reuters) - South African unions
representing more than 1 million civil servants and the
government plan wage talks on Thursday, hours before a union
deadline to reach a deal that would avert a prolonged strike.
 ""We are optimistic that the government will come back to us
with a significant offer. Our members want to avoid protracted
strike action,"" Sizwe Pamla, a spokesman for the public sector
union NEHAWU, said on Wednesday. The group is a part of the
country's largest umbrella labour group, COSATU.
 COSATU unions and other civil service labour groups staged a
one-day strike on Tuesday, seeking an 8.6 percent pay rise,
twice the current rate of inflation, and a 1,000 rand ($138)
monthly housing allowance.
 They threatened a prolonged strike they said would bring the
government to a halt unless a deal is reached by Thursday.
 The action increased pressure on President Jacob Zuma's
government to prevent a repeat of a massive public sector strike
three years ago that dented the economy and support for his
predecessor, analysts said.
 The government has offered 7 percent and 630 rand for
housing, but analysts believe it is likely to raise its offer
rather than risk a strike just before a policy-setting meeting
next month of the ruling African National Congress.
 Analysts expect the ANC, which has a longstanding alliance
with organised labour, to give in to the unions' demands. Such a
deal would make it hard to bring the budget deficit down from
6.7 percent of gross domestic product without spending cutbacks
elsewhere.
 Separately, South African auto workers seeking pay increases
of more than triple the inflation rate went on an indefinite
strike on Wednesday, hitting production.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2010 05:20AM ET</span>",RPT-ANALYSIS-Africa eyes East for help on sovereign wealth funds," (Repeats to additional subscribers. Text unchanged.)
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Africa's nascent sovereign funds
are turning to Asia and the Gulf for a steer on how to manage
resource revenues, a move that could shield wealth for the
future and lure more attention from international investors.
 But there is no simple ""cut and paste"" model as Africa faces
a challenge in striking a balance between spending today to
build infrastructure and reduce poverty and saving for tomorrow,
as well as guarding against corruption and squandering.
 Nigeria, Angola and Ghana are among countries that are in a
process of setting up a SWF to manage oil windfall revenues.
 Some African countries have sought advice from Norway,
considered to have the most transparent and efficient fund and
one that is awash with oil money.
 But they are also increasingly looking at developing Asian
and Gulf nations, where funds are often managed in an opaque but
strategically efficient manner, which may suit Africa better.
 ""The major issue with SWFs is putting in structures both
legal as well as others so that you don't spend all the money
immediately,"" said Andrew Ang, adviser to Norway's SWF and an
associate at the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research.
 ""Asian and Middle Eastern funds ... do this in a
non-transparent way. They manage to achieve legitimacy without
huge public transparency.""
 Proper management and investment of oil revenues for the
wider economy improve growth prospects and credit ratings.
 Nigeria and Angola already have ratings of ""B+"" from
Standard & Poor's. These ratings would help attract investors
looking to invest in emerging market bonds.
 ""Having a large reserve fund positively affects investor
perception of stability and it will affect credit ratings. The
reputation effect is very valuable,"" Ang said.
 
 LOOK EAST
 Many governments in the Gulf and Asia -- home to the world's
largest SWFs such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority or China
Investment Corporation -- have used SWFs as a strategic economic
tool to diversify their economies.
 Unlike Norway however, these funds have operated at arm's
length from their governments and disclosed little. This helps
them avoid public criticism in case they make a short-term loss
and focus on long-term goals instead.
 Ghana -- whose oil field is due to start bringing in
revenues from late 2010 -- is speaking to Norway, Trinidad &
Tobago, Nigeria, Angola and Gabon on how to run a sovereign
wealth fund.
 OPEC member Nigeria has sought advice from the United Arab
Emirates, while Rwanda, which hopes to set up an SWF by 2020
once it becomes a methane gas exporter, is speaking to
Singapore.
 ""The model works well because they're relatively secretive.
You can't say transparency is a golden ticket,"" said Gary Smith,
head of central banks, supranational institutions and SWF
business at BNP Paribas Investment Partners.
""The 'Be like Norway' message is okay but it's not
appropriate in its entirety. But Norway has got things to offer:
internal marketing to domestic audiences and stakeholders.""
 Norway's fund benefits from high transparency and
accountability thanks to a clear mandate and the integrity of
asset allocation process, which they publish on a regular basis.
 ""There is a huge tendency for government-sponsored
organisation to become bureaucratic, inefficient, wasteful,
without the private sector value of profit maximisation,"" Ang
said. ""Norway is a shining light that shows how to build a
professional organisation within a government structure.""
 
 CORRUPTION AND WASTE
 It is paramount for African nations to establish a clear
framework and objectives for their funds, before they even begin
a debate on how to allocate assets and maximise profits.
 In Nigeria, a lack of clear legal basis on revenue
distribution between federal, state and local governments has
led to constant political wrangling.
 This has resulted in the Excess Crude Account, which the
country plans to replace with a sovereign fund, shrinking to
$3.4 billion, less than a quarter of the amount it had 3 years
ago.
 Little progress has been made for Angola's plan, announced
in June last year, to set up a sovereign fund. Despite its vast
oil and mineral wealth, an estimated two-thirds of Angolans live
on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank.
 ""You need spending rules and a clearly written mandate.
Discretionary spending will open it up to expropriation or
corruption risk,"" Ang said.
 They must also avoid the ""Dutch disease"" problem -- a phrase
stemming from the 1960s Dutch economic crisis following the
discovery of North Sea natural gas.
 Rapid oil sector growth could make other industries less
competitive -- as happened to the Dutch -- and lead to lower
growth and development than those with fewer natural resources.
 ""Whoever is setting up a SWF, they shouldn't look at it as a
ticket to an elite club,"" Israfil Mammadov, chief investment
officer of Azerbaijan's sovereign fund, told Reuters.
 ""They should look at it from the point of view of public
finance discipline. You don't look at a SWF and say everything
is fine.""

 * Prices have yet to peak, c.bank seen on hold
 * Current account deficit up, FDI falls

(Adds detail, central bank, analyst comment)
 By Marius Zaharia
 BUCHAREST, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Romania's annual inflation
jumped less than expected in July, but a value-added tax hike
will keep showing its teeth in coming months, forcing the
central bank to hold fire on interest rates despite a worsening
economy.
 Official data showed annual price growth quickened to 7.1
percent in July from June's 4.4 percent, boosted mainly by a 5
percentage points VAT hike to 24 percent last month.
 The tax increase shows the government is on track with its
austerity drive, needed to keep its fiscal deficit within limits
agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
 However, prices do not yet fully reflect the higher VAT rate
and are expected to rise further this year. The market consensus
for July was 7.3 percent and the central bank predicts 7.8
percent inflation in December.
 ""A bigger figure was expected, but it seems that the first
round effect from the VAT rise was not yet incorporated,"" one
trader with a foreign bank in Bucharest said.
 ""We'll see second round effects soon and they'll have an
impact on (inflation) expectations and I expect a sell-off on
bonds this fall.""
Soaring inflation leaves the central bank in a difficult
situation as the country faces a deepening economic contraction,
seen at around 2 percent this year, and the bank is widely
expected to keep interest rates on hold at least for the rest of
2010.
 
 CPI YET TO PEAK
 Governor Mugur Isarescu has said there is no reason to
tighten monetary policy as long as second-round effects from the
VAT rise remain moderate.
 Isarescu's adviser Lucian Croitoru told Reuters the July
figure was in line with the bank's expectations.
 Next inflation data will be key as they will show how much a
25 percent cut in state wages starting with the July pay check
disbursed this month will tame price pressures.
 Many economists say Romanian prices are less sensitive to
swings in domestic demand than in other countries in the region.
However, some supermarket chains have advertised their products
by pledging to keep prices flat or by giving ""VAT
reimbursements"".
 Recent floods and higher grain prices globally are also key
risks for inflation.
 Data published earlier on Wednesday showed Romania's current
account deficit widened 50 percent on the year to 3.6 billion
euros ($4.73 billion) in the first half.
 The increase was partly because of a sharp decline in the
the current transfers surplus, mainly reflecting cash
remittances from Romanians working abroad, to 1.1 billion euros
from 2.1 billion euros in the same period of last year.
 Roughly half of the current account gap -- once the
country's main vulnerability and reason to seek IMF aid in 2009
-- was covered by foreign direct investment which fell to 1.8
billion euros from 2.6 billion in january-June 2009.
 The gap narrowed significantly last year as the economy
contracted by over 7 percent.

 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Overseas growth propelled a
profit rise at Standard Life on Wednesday, although a downgrade
from one of the sector's top analysts pulled down shares in
Britain's fourth-biggest listed insurer.
 Operating profit before tax from continuing operations rose
10 percent from last year to 182 million pounds ($286.6
million), boosted by better earnings in areas such as Canada and
India.
 Net inflows rose 71 percent to 5.3 billion pounds, while the
group raised its interim dividend by 4.8 percent to 4.35 pence.
 But Standard Life shares fell around 4 percent in
mid-morning trade as broker Panmure Gordon cut its rating on
Standard Life to ""hold"" from ""buy."" The stock has risen nearly
23 percent over the last month since touching a 52-week low of
170 pence in early July.
 ""I thought they were good figures but the stock's had a good
run,"" said Panmure analyst Barrie Cornes, whom Thomson Reuters
Starmine rates as the joint best analyst on the stock, along
with Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Blair Stewart.
 Cavendish Asset Management director Paul Mumford thought the
company's results were good and said he would hold on to the
stock for now.
 ""The stock's had a good run-up, so you're bound to have a
bit of profit-taking. But one encouraging thing is that they've
increased the dividend by about 5 percent,"" said Mumford, who
holds around 130,000 Standard Life shares in his portfolio.
 
 BRITISH INSURERS HIGHER PROFITS
 Standard Life's earnings follow a set of solid profit
increases from Britain's top insurers this month.
 Earlier this month, larger UK rivals Aviva and Legal &
General posted higher first-half profits and delivered upbeat
outlooks, while Prudential Plc is also expected to report a rise
in profit on Thursday.
 ""Whilst the economic background remains uncertain we believe
that the underlying demographic and regulatory trends in our key

Standard Life said in a statement.
 Chief Executive David Nish told reporters on a conference

priority areas, and added that Standard Life could consider
small-size acquisitions in future.
 ""I think, as you've seen in the last 18 months, we do
acquire businesses to accelerate organic growth,"" he said.
 ""They tend to be smaller acquisitions and it's much more
about accelerating organic growth where, maybe, we have a gap in
a scale, or a gap in the proposition or a gap in distribution
capability.""

 * Wheat could be a subject of restriction
 
 (Adds farm minister, traders comments)
 By Natalia Zinets and Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian government, fearful
of a possible food grain shortage at home, said on Wednesday it
was considering curbing grain exports, although a final decision
would be made next week.
 The grain harvest in Ukraine, the world's No 1 exporter of
barley and sixth-largest of wheat, is likely to fall 13 percent
to 40-42 million tonnes this year from last, after severe winter
frosts and a scorching summer heatwave. It needs more than half
of that total for itself.
 Although the quotas are likely to be small, the announcement
could rattle grain markets already jittery after Russia,
stricken by the worst drought in 130 years, announced ann export
ban, helping global wheat prices soar to two-year highs. Prices
have since retreated, but remain volatile.
 ""If quotas are imposed it would be on wheat,"" Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk told a news conference, but later
said maize and other cereals could also be subject to
restrictions.
""The first quota proposal could be 7 to 8 million tonnes.
This is for all grains. The final volume of quotas could be
after maize harvesting,"" he said. Ukraine is among the world's
top five exporters of maize.
 Local analysts said the export quotas, rather than an
outright ban, could help to bring some calm to the market.
 ""It (quotas) seems to be an acceptable decision. It could
partially calm the market and gives traders clarity,"" said
Mykola Vernitsky from ProAgro consultancy.
 Ukraine introduced grain export quotas in the 2007/08 season
after a smaller harvest.
 
 CAUTION
 The World Bank on Monday cautioned against countries taking
any action that could add to market uncertainty, in particular
widespread export bans like Russia's.
 It was not clear what support Ukraine would have from the
World Trade Organisation, of which it is a member, for
introducing quotas.
 Anxiety about the possibility of export restrictions pushed
customs officials to impose curbs of their own in late July,
although the government insisted then that there were no grounds
for limits.
 The Ukrainian grain traders' union UZA said on Tuesday that
exporters had suspended wheat purchases for exports because of
the new customs curbs.
 Analysts and traders say Ukrainian exports could fall to
about 15-18 million tonnes in the 2010/11 season from 21.5
million in 2009/10 due to the smaller crop.
 ""We need to be able to see clearly in front of us. We don't
know what is going on. The customs detain vessels and we cannot
buy for future exports,"" a foreign trader told Reuters. ""If
there are quotas -- that's good.""
 A trade source said on Wednesday that customs officials in
Ukraine had detained cargo ships with grain belonging to five
traders. Grain quality was the reason given.
 The customs service has confirmed the detention of one
vessel with grain in the sea port of Berdyansk.
 Some traders said it was likely that only milling wheat
would be subject to restrictions.
 ""There is no reason to limit feed grain exports. We have a
significant surplus of feed grain and any limit will hit farmers
as they will not be able to sell grain at a good price,"" a
Ukrainian trader told Reuters.

 LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a 15-year low
versus a broadly firmer yen on Wednesday while world stocks fell
to a 1-1/2 week trough as the Federal Reserve's dovish
assessment of the U.S. economy knocked Treasury yields lower.
 Data showing slowing Chinese investment and factory output
growth, coupled with a Bank of England downgrade of its growth
forecast and a dovish tone from its Governor Mervyn King, also
prompted investors to cut back on risky assets.
On Tuesday, the Fed announced plans to use cash from
maturing mortgage bonds it holds to buy more government debt,
saying the pace of the recovery in output and employment had
slowed in recent months.
 Investors decided the U.S. central bank's action was
unlikely to have much immediate impact on the labour market and
consumer spending, although the move reinforced expectations the
Fed would keep interest rates low for longer.
 ""The comments from the Fed yesterday are weighing on the
market. There is a bit of nervousness about the outlook for the
U.S. economy and we see some economy-sensitive stocks among the
worst performers,"" said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity markets
strategist at Deutsche Postbank in Bonn, Germany.

1.1 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> dropped 1.3 percent.
U.S. stock futures were down around 1.3 percent , pointing
to a weaker open on Wall Street later.
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> were down 0.9 percent.
 The Bank of England revised its growth forecasts lower and
said British inflation will fall well below its 2 percent target
in two years, even if interest rates remain at record lows,
leaving room for more policy easing if the economy worsens.
 In China, data showed growth in investment and factory
output slowed further last month as the government brought
credit growth back to normal after a record lending spree in
2009 to counter the global financial crisis.
 The dollar was up 1 percent versus a basket of major
currencies <.DXY> as investors who became risk-averse sold
higher-yielding currencies against the U.S. currency.
 U.S. two-year Treasury note yields fell as low as 0.493
percent .

position of the U.S. economy,"" said Adam Cole, head of currency
strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The market's reaction is that if the U.S. economy is
slowing materially it will not be in isolation and it has
therefore responded by selling risk.""
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.2 percent to $79.33 a barrel as

percent against the euro and the Australian dollar.
 The Federal Reserve said it will use cash from maturing
mortgage bonds it holds to buy more U.S. government debt,
marking a policy shift from a central bank which only a few
months ago debated how to start exiting monetary stimulus.
 U.S. Treasury yields fell in response, reflecting
expectations that U.S. interest rates would stay at record low
levels for some time to come, pushing the dollar close to the
key 85.00 level against the yen.
 Investors were also concerned by what the Fed's move said
about a faltering economic recovery, driving global stocks lower
along with perceived riskier currencies.
 ""If anything the Fed decision pushed back rate hike
expectations in the U.S. and the initial reaction was a jump in
euro/dollar, but quickly U.S. equities turned negative, pushing
the dollar higher against most currencies except the yen,"" said
Niels Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 At 0740 GMT, the dollar fell 0.3 percent from late U.S.
trade to 85.12 yen, edging near an eight-month low of 85.02 yen
hit on trading platform EBS last week. A drop below November's
low of 84.82 yen would take the dollar to a 15-year low.
 ""The dollar could fall below 85.00 yen at any moment,"" said
Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX spot trading at Mizuho Corporate
Bank in Tokyo.

 EURO, AUSSIE FALL
 Market players cited talk of stop-loss offers in the dollar
near 85.00 yen, 84.80 yen and 84.75 yen, and large option
barriers at 84.75 yen and 84.50 yen, suggesting that the
dollar's drop against the yen could gain momentum if such levels
are hit.
 ""Given the contrast with the BOJ's decision yesterday, we
seem to have entered a situation where the yen is likely to
rise,"" said Akira Hoshino, chief manager for the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange trading department.
 The Fed's pledge to maintain asset purchases and shift to
Treasuries does suggest it may boost the size of its already
massive $2.3 trillion balance sheet if the economy loses
momentum, market players said.
 The euro fell 0.9 percent against the dollar to $1.3057,
having dropped as low as $1.3032, its weakest since July 30,
while the higher-yielding Australian dollar fell 1.2 percent to
$0.9030. 
 They also lost 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent respectively
against the yen as equity market falls encouraged investors to
shun risk in favour of the low-yielding Japanese currency.
 European shares fell 0.8 percent after the Japanese Nikkei
average fell 2.7 percent.
 ""The fall in share prices is worrying. If U.S. data
continues to deteriorate, the Fed will be urged to take more
easing steps,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo
Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo.

 By Georgina Prodhan and Terji Kinnunen
 HELSINKI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Finnish insurer Sampo reported
a 27 percent increase in second-quarter pretax profit to 334
million euros ($439 million), beating expectations, thanks to
lower claims at its non-life unit.
 The results confirmed an upbeat trend among European
insurers as an economic rebound helps boost premiums.
 Sampo said on Wednesday its second-quarter combined ratio, a
key measure of underwriting profitability which expresses costs
and claims expenses as a proportion of premium income, fell to
89.9 percent from 90.7 percent a year earlier.
 Shares in Sampo rose 1.8 percent to 19.69 euros by 0836 GMT,
outperforming a 0.9 percent dip in the European insurance index
. Sampo was the most traded stock on the Helsinki bourse,, a
position normally held by Nokia.
 ""The second-quarter results were good, they surprised
positively,"" said Kimmo Ramo, analyst at Evli Bank said.
 ""The better-than-expected pretax profit was boosted by the
P&C (property and casualty) insurance business, in which the
combined ratio was much better than forecast.""
 Sampo narrowed its full-year guidance, saying it expected
the combined ratio to be between 92 and 94 percent. Sampo had
targeted a 2010 ratio below 95 percent.
 Sampo repeated it expected a good 2010 result after the
second quarter, in which its pretax profit beat all forecasts in
a Reuters poll of 11 analysts.
 At Sampo's P&C unit, If, pretax profit rose 27 percent to
208 million euros.
 ""Claims development in If P&C was favourable in the second
quarter of 2010 after the extreme winter conditions of the first
quarter,"" Sampo said in a statement.
 Reported pretax profit was boosted by 106 million euros from
its stake in Nordea Bank. Sampo said it owned 20.5 percent of
Nordea as of June 30. It books its share of Nordea results as an
associated company.

 By Amena Bakr
 DUBAI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - UAE-based Dana Gas posted a net
profit of 33 million dirhams ($8.98 million) in the second
quarter, as its Egypt and Kurdistan operations delivered high
output, but the results fell short of analysts estimates.
 Four analysts on average had expected Dana to post a net
profit of 36.3 million dirhams for the second quarter according
to a Reuters poll.
 Dana's second-quarter net profit excluded an unrealized loss
of 213 million dirhams for its investment in Hungary's MOL oil
and gas firm.
 ""There was a loss because Hungary's stock exchange was
impacted by the Greek crisis and weakness of the euro and
dollar,"" said Chief Financial Officer Jim Dewar in an interview
on Wednesday.
 Dana's Egypt operations produced 3.8 million barrels of oil
equivalent (boe) during the quarter, a 19 percent increase
compared to the same period last year, the statement said.
 ""Our operations in Egypt and Kurdistan have delivered a good
increase in production, while prices of gas remained strong,""
Dewar said.
 Dana posted a net profit 392 million dirhams in the second
quarter of 2009 mainly due to the sale of a 10 percent stake in
Pearl Petroleum in Kurdistan.
 In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Dana Gas produced 1.06
million boe of gas and condensate during the quarter, an
increase of about 88 percent over the same period in 2009, the
statement said.
 Dana expects the first train of the liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) Plant at Khor Mor field to start later this year, said
Dewar.
 ""This year we will focus on developing our existing assets
Egypt, Kurdistan and the UAE,"" he said.
 Last year, Dana said it was part of a UAE and European
consortium that includes Austria's OMV and Hungary's MOL
planning to pump enough gas from Iraq's Kurdistan region to
kick-start the estimated $10 billion Nabucco pipeline project to
supply Europe.
 Asked about the company's cash position, Dewar said it was
$175 million, while a final decision on the farm out of 20-30
percent of its Egypt assets will be made by the firm's board
members by the end of the third quarter this year or middle of
the fourth quarter.
Dana Gas reported profit of 33 million dirhams during the
first quarter of 2010 due to higher oil and gas output and
rising energy prices.

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Foreign exchange rates are at a
critical juncture and if the yen rises rapidly Japan's government
and central bank must work together to keep it from damaging the
nation's economy, the vice banking minister said on Wednesday.
 But Kohei Otsuka, a key policy-maker in Prime Minister Naoto
Kan's Democratic Party, questioned if there would be any benefit
from solo intervention by Tokyo in currency markets, saying it
would have little effect on the yen's rise.
 Japan's finance minister has voiced concerns about one-sided
and disorderly market moves as the yen hovers near a 15-year high
against the dollar, threatening to harm Japan's exporters and
derail a feeble recovery from the global crisis.
 ""There's no predicting any action beyond those (comments),""
Otsuka told Reuters in an interview, referring to the possibility
of currency intervention.
 ""I'm not in a position to comment on that, but currency
(rates) seem to have come to something of a critical juncture.""
 The dollar remained within sight of a 15-year low versus the
yen on Wednesday, dipping 0.2 percent from late U.S. trading on
Tuesday to 85.32 yen.
 The greenback hit an eight-month low of 85.02 yen on trading
platform EBS last week.
 On currency intervention, Otsuka said Japan would need to win
agreement on coordinated action from Europe and the United States
to stem a rapid rise in the yen as a move by Tokyo alone would
hardly help.
 He voiced concern about the effects of a rapid rise in the
yen on deflation, which has plagued Japan for much of the past
decade.
 ""A rapid yen rise would boost deflationary factors, so the
government and the BOJ must act as one in considering what to do
given our commitment to act against deflation,"" Otsuka said.
 Japan's central bank held off on new policy steps to combat a
stronger yen at a board meeting that ended on Tuesday, saving its
limited firepower in case the currency's rise accelerates and
threatens the country's fragile economic recovery.
 Otsuka, a former BOJ official well-versed in monetary policy,
underscored that point, saying the BOJ will need to act if
currency moves have a big impact on the economy.
 While praising the BOJ's response to the financial crisis in
the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Otsuka said
the central bank could do more depending on changes in the
economy.
 ""Considering the common sense that prevailed in monetary
policy 10 to 15 years ago ... I can highly evaluate the BOJ's
efforts in meeting the challenges in a (new) policy frontier,"" he
said.
 ""The economy including currencies is ever-changing, it's a
living thing, so it's impossible for central banks to say they
cannot do more.""
 Otsuka did not elaborate on what the should be done by the
BOJ, which has jurisdiction over monetary policy, but he saw no
need for the bank to adopt a rigid inflation target to beat
deflation.
 ""The BOJ said it would not tolerate negative inflation, and
that means it has virtually set inflation targeting ... While it
has not achieved positive inflation, it would be meaningless to
aim for a 2-3 percent inflation.""

 By Masayuki Kitano and Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered within sight of
a 15-year low versus the yen on Wednesday after the Federal
Reserve announced plans to boost a flagging economy by
reinvesting money from maturing mortgage bonds in government
debt.
 But the greenback rose against the high-yielding Australian
dollar and other major currencies as traders reduced their
exposure to risk as U.S. and Asian shares fell even after the
Fed's action.
 Although the Fed's move did not come as a complete surprise
to the market, it marked a policy shift for the U.S. central
bank, which only a few months ago debated how to start winding
down some of its monetary stimulus programmes.
 The Fed's pledge to maintain asset purchases and shift to
Treasuries does suggest it may boost the size of its already
massive $2.3 trillion balance sheet if the economy loses
momentum, market players said.
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday
to 85.37 yen, edging back towards an eight-month low of 85.02 yen
hit on trading platform EBS last week. A drop below November's
low of 84.82 yen would take the dollar to a 15-year low.
 ""The dollar could fall below 85.00 yen at any moment,"" said
Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX spot trading at Mizuho Corporate
Bank.
 Market players cited talk of stop-loss offers in the dollar
near 85.00 yen, 84.80 yen and 84.75 yen, and large option
barriers at 84.75 yen and 84.50 yen, suggesting that the dollar's
drop against the yen could gain momentum if such levels are hit.
 ""Given the contrast with the BOJ's decision yesterday, we
seem to have entered a situation where the yen is likely to
rise,"" said Akira Hoshino, chief manager for the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange trading department.
 The U.S. central bank acknowledged economic growth had slowed
in recent months and reiterated its intention to hold benchmark
interest rates at record lows for an extended time.
 ""(The Fed's) decision should be seen primarily as a signal to
financial markets, consumers and businesses that the FOMC is
ready to start a second round of quantitative easing if the
Committee sees a double dip around the corner,"" Rabobank analyst
Philip Marey said in a research note, referring to the U.S.
central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
 YEN ON THE RISE
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady and held off on
new policy steps on Tuesday, saving its limited firepower in case
the currency's rise accelerates.
 Fears that the yen's rise could accelerate hit Tokyo shares,
with the Nikkei share average sliding more than 2 percent. Shares
also fell more than 1 percent in South Korea and Australia.
 ""The fall in share prices is worrying. If U.S. data continues
to deteriorate, the Fed will be urged to take more easing steps,""
said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust Bank.
 The fall in equities had a feedback effect on the yen,
helping to lift it against higher-yielding currencies and other
major currencies.
 The Australian dollar shed 0.9 percent against the yen to
77.35 yen, the euro lost 0.4 percent to 111.75 yen, and sterling
fell 0.5 percent to 134.78 yen.
 The low-yielding yen is a funding currency for carry trades
and tends to rise in times of market stress.
 A drop in the dollar below 84.82 yen could trigger more
market speculation about the possibility of Japanese
intervention.
 Traders think the yen will eventually test those levels as
Japan is unlikely to intervene to curb the yen's strength unless
dollar/yen falls closer to 80 yen, or its moves become more
volatile.
 The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3099, pulling away from last
week's three-month peak of $1.3334 and hitting stop-loss orders
scattered around $1.3150-$1.3130.
 But the euro could be poised to rise in the wake of the Fed's
decision and economic assessment, analysts said.
 ""With further policy moves now a clear possibility, the USD
will come under pressure beyond the impact of U.S.-Euro area
growth divergence alone,"" analysts at JPMorgan said.

 By Zhou Xin and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Growth in Chinese investment
and factory output slowed further last month as the government
brought credit growth back to normal after a record lending
spree in 2009 to counter the global financial crisis.
 The figures, along with weaker retail sales, add to the
picture of softening domestic demand painted on Tuesday by a
sharp drop in import growth.
 ""Industrial output continued to ease, indicating a
moderation of economic activities. But a sharp slowdown in
economic growth can be ruled out, because resilient household
consumption will help compensate for a drop in investment,""
said Zhu Baoliang, a researcher with the State Information
Center, a government think tank in Beijing.
 Annual factory output growth slowed to 13.4 percent last
month from 13.7 percent in June but beat forecasts of a 13.2
percent rise.
 Year-to-date growth in investment in fixed assets such as
flats and factories in urban areas slowed to 24.9 percent from
25.5 percent, undershooting forecasts of a 25.2 percent rise.
 However, after taking into account wholesale inflation,
which dropped to 4.8 percent in the year to July from 6.4
percent in June, real growth on the month was steady, according
to Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 ""China's growth is slowing, but we see no sign of a hard
landing,"" he said.
 ""TOO RESTRICTIVE""
 Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the National Bureau of
Statistics, which released the data, also struck a note of
calm.
 He described the slowdown as moderate and a welcome step to
a more sustainable model of growth that relies less on
energy-intensive heavy industry. China this week ordered the
closure of more than 2,000 obsolete, fuel-guzzling factories,
steel mills and cement works.
 Some economists, though, were less sanguine.
 Yu Song and Helen Qiao, economists at Goldman Sachs,
pointed to a moderation in annual retail sales growth to 17.9
percent in July, from 18.3 percent in June, that fell short of
projections of an 18.3 percent increase.
 A slowdown in growth of money supply, the lubricant of
every economy, was particularly alarming, they said in a note.
 Annual growth in the broad M2 measure of money slowed to
17.6 percent from 18.5 percent in June, a rate that economists
had expected to be repeated in July.
 ""We believe this level of broad money supply growth is
clearly too restrictive as it will put more downward pressure
on domestic demand growth in the near future,"" Yu and Qiao
said.
 There are also question marks next to overseas demand.
 Although figures on Tuesday showed stronger-than-expected
exports, the Federal Reserve warned overnight that the pace of
the U.S. recovery had slowed.
 China is also concerned about the fragility of demand from
Europe, which is drowning in debt.
 NO RELAXATION
 If growth does continue to soften, some economists believe
the government could speed up targeted investments in areas
such as low-income housing, rural development and clean energy.
 Another option would be to relax this year's loan quota of
7.5 trillion yuan, down from a record 9.6 trillion last year.
 Tao Wang, UBS's China economist, said there was no reason
for a knee-jerk easing. ""The slowdown is still moderate. If
people were looking for policy relaxation, they would be
disappointed from this set of numbers,"" she said.
 New loans in July alone totalled 533 billion yuan, the
central bank said, below forecasts of a 600 billion increase.
 Zhu, the State Information Center researcher, said the
government would not water down the full-year target.
 ""It will not relax efforts to control lending growth, even
though the economy is slowing,"" he said.
 Beijing is particularly anxious to take the air out of an
inflated property market.
 Fearing that prices were feeding on themselves, Beijing
increased down payments and mortgage rates, made it tougher to
buy multiple homes and tightened financing for developers.
 The curbs are sapping demand for everything from steel to
sofas. But apartment prices in major cities, while no longer
rising, are still beyond the reach of ordinary people -- an
incendiary issue for the ruling Communist party.
 While the case for loosening policy is not clear-cut, the
consensus is that Beijing has no cause to tighten either, even
though inflation rose back above the government's 3 percent
target in July.
 Consumer price inflation accelerated to 3.3 percent, in
line with forecasts, from 2.9 percent in the year to June, but
economists said the jump was the fleeting result of widespread
flooding across China that has boosted food costs.
 Overall, economists are confident that gross domestic
product growth for all of 2010 will beat last year's outcome of
9.1 percent and catapult China ahead of Japan as the world's
second-largest economy after the United States -- a ranking
that, by some calculations, it has already been secured.

 By Kevin Yao
 SINGAPORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar teetered toward a
15-year low against the yen on Wednesday after the Federal
Reserve gave a more pessimistic assessment of the weakening
U.S. economy, while technology plays dragged Asian stocks
lower.
 Major European stocks fell 0.5 percent in early trade,
while U.S. Treasury futures hit their highest in 17 months
after the Fed announced it would buy more government bonds to
help shore up flagging growth.
 Markets are still awaiting further details on the Fed plan,
but analysts doubted the amount of the purchases would be large
enough to have a substantial stimulative impact.
 Some market watchers believe the Fed's move could actually
fuel more concern about the economy, hurting investors'
appetite for riskier assets such as stocks and commodities.
 ""The Fed will take more actions in the future to inject
more money into the bank system. You can say that's the second
wave of quantative easing,"" said Daniel Chan, chief economist
and wealth management strategist BWC Capital markets in Hong
Kong.
 ""That will be positive for U.S. treasuries market but not
positive for global stock markets,"" he added.
 The U.S. central bank said on Tuesday it would reinvest the
money from maturing mortgage bonds it holds into government
debt to counter recent signs of economic weakness. It left
interest rates near zero and renewed its pledge to keep them
low for an extended period.
 U.S. Treasuries prices rallied, with yields on the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.7416 percent,
the lowest in more than four months.
 September futures on the 10-year Treasury note rose 8.5/32
to 125-8/32 after hitting a 17-month peak at 125-9/32.
 The step marked an important policy shift for the Fed,
which only a few months ago debated how to start rolling back
some of its emergency stimulus schemes put in place during the
global financial crisis.
 But the Fed's more sombre assessment of the economy added
more pressure on the ailing U.S. dollar, which continued to
weaken against the yen.
 Japan's Nikkei average dropped 2.7 percent, as yen strength
and worries about weaker demand undermined shares of exporters.
Honda Motor Co and Canon Inc both shed 3.3 percent, while Sony
Corp fell 2.8 percent.
 ""Worries about a further strengthening in the yen against
the dollar grew after the Fed's new steps towards easing policy
and with the Bank of Japan maintaining the status quo,"" said
Masaru Hamasaki, a senior strategist at Toyota Asset
Management.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell
1.5 percent, dragged down by tech counters after brokerages
downgraded their business outlooks for several major U.S.
sector bellwethers.
 Overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell but closed off their lows
after the Fed pledged to underpin the recovery.
 But tech companies pressured the Nasdaq, with chipmakers
Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc falling on analysts'
downgrades, while Novell Inc dropped a day after cutting its
third-quarter revenue outlook. and
 Korean shares fell 1.3 percent as Hynix Semiconductor, the
world's No.2 memory chip producer, tumbled nearly 6.2 percent
following the selloff in U.S. chipmakers.
 Asian traders saw some comfort in fresh data from China,
however, which confirmed its strong economic growth was
moderating but showed no signs it was in danger of a hard
landing.
 DOLLAR FALTERS
 The dollar dipped a fifth of a percent to 85.32 yen edging
towards an eight-month low of 85.02 yen hit last week. If it
slips below November's low of 84.82 yen, it would mark the
currency's weakest level in 15 years.
 ""The dollar could fall below 85.00 yen at any moment,"" says
Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX spot trading at Mizuho Corporate
Bank.
 The Australian dollar shed 0.9 percent against the yen to
77.35 yen the euro lost 0.4 percent to 111.75 yen and sterling
fell 0.5 percent to 134.78 yen
 The low-yielding yen is a funding currency for carry trades
and tends to rise in times of market stress.
 Elsewhere, oil fell 66 cents to $79.59 a barrel on demand
concerns after data showing a rise in U.S. crude imports
overshadowed a deeper-than-expected decline in crude stocks.
 Spot gold gained 35 cents to $1,202.20 an ounce after the
Fed's move, still below a 3-week high of $1,212.61 hit last
week.

2.7416 percent, the lowest in more than four months.
 September futures on the 10-year Treasury note rose 8.5/32
to 125-8/32  after hitting a 17-month peak at 125-9/32.
 The step marked an important policy shift for the Fed,
which only a few months ago debated how to start rolling back
some of its emergency stimulus schemes put in place during the
global financial crisis.
 But the Fed's more sombre assessment of the economy added
more pressure on the ailing U.S. dollar, which continued to
weaken against the yen.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> dropped 2.7 percent, as yen
strength and worries about weaker demand undermined shares of
exporters. Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Canon Inc <7751.T> both

 ""Worries about a further strengthening in the yen against

Management.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell

 DOLLAR FALTERS
 The dollar dipped a fifth of a percent to 85.32 yen ,
edging towards an eight-month low of 85.02 yen hit last week.
If it slips below November's low of 84.82 yen, it would mark
the currency's weakest level in 15 years.
 ""The dollar could fall below 85.00 yen at any moment,"" says
Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX spot trading at Mizuho Corporate
Bank.
 The Australian dollar shed 0.9 percent against the yen to
77.35 yen , the euro lost 0.4 percent to 111.75 yen
, and sterling fell 0.5 percent to 134.78 yen

 The low-yielding yen is a funding currency for carry trades
and tends to rise in times of market stress.
 Elsewhere, oil  fell 66 cents to $79.59 a barrel on
demand concerns after data showing a rise in U.S. crude imports
overshadowed a deeper-than-expected decline in crude stocks.
 Spot gold  gained 35 cents to $1,202.20 an ounce
after the Fed's move, still below a 3-week high of $1,212.61
hit last week.

 By Masayuki Kitano and Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered within sight of
a 15-year low versus the yen on Wednesday after the Federal
Reserve announced plans to boost a flagging economy by
reinvesting money from maturing mortgage bonds in government
debt.
 The move did not come as a complete surprise to the market
but it marked a policy shift for the Fed, which only a few months
ago debated how to start winding down some of its monetary
stimulus programmes.
 The Fed's pledge to maintain asset purchases and shift to
Treasuries does suggest it may boost the size of its already
massive $2.3 trillion balance sheet if the economy loses
momentum, market players said.
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday
to 85.37 yen, edging back toward an eight-month low of 85.02 yen
hit on trading platform EBS last week. A drop under November's
low of 84.82 yen would take the dollar to a 15-year low.
 ""The dollar could fall below 85.00 yen at any moment,"" says
Shuichi Kanehira, head of FX spot trading at Mizuho Corporate
Bank.
 Market players cited talk of stop-loss offers in the dollar
near 85.00 yen, 84.80 yen and 84.75 yen and large option barriers
at 84.75 yen and 84.50 yen, suggesting that the dollar's drop
against the yen could gain momentum if such levels are hit.
 ""Given the contrast with the BOJ's decision yesterday, we
seem to have entered a situation where the yen is likely to
rise,"" said Akira Hoshino, chief manager for the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange trading department.
 The U.S. central bank acknowledged economic growth had slowed
in recent months and reiterated its intention to hold benchmark
interest rates at record lows for an extended time.
 ""(The Fed's) decision should be seen primarily as a signal to
financial markets, consumers and businesses that the FOMC is
ready to start a second round of quantitative easing if the
Committee sees a double dip around the corner,"" Rabobank analyst
Philip Marey said in a research note, referring to the U.S.
central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
 YEN ON THE RISE
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady and held off on
new policy steps on Tuesday, saving its limited firepower in case
the currency's rise accelerates.
 Fears that the yen's rise could accelerate hit Tokyo shares,
with the Nikkei share average sliding more than 2 percent.
 The fall in share prices had a feedback effect on the yen,
helping to lift it against higher-yielding currencies and other
major currencies.
 The Australian dollar shed 0.8 percent against the yen to
77.44 yen, the euro slid 0.7 percent to 111.85 yen, and sterling
fell 0.6 percent to 134.72 yen.
 The low-yielding yen is a funding currency for carry trades
and tends to rise in times of market stress.
 A dollar drop below 84.82 yen could trigger more market
speculation about the possibility of Japanese intervention.
 Traders think the yen will eventually test those levels as
Japan is unlikely to intervene to curb the yen unless dollar/yen
falls closer to 80 yen, or its moves become more volatile.
 The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3099, pulling away from last
week's three-month peak of $1.3334.
 But the euro could be poised to rise in the wake of the Fed's
decision and economic assessment, analysts said.
 ""With further policy moves now a clear possibility, the USD
will come under pressure beyond the impact of U.S.-Euro area
growth divergence alone,"" analysts at JPMorgan said.

sign a bill into law on Wednesday aimed at helping U.S.
manufacturers by temporarily suspending import duties on a long
list of raw materials they use to make finished products.
 The White House said the legislation, which passed the U.S.
Congress last month, would cut costs for American businesses
and for consumers.
 The bill is part of a ""Make it in America"" agenda Obama's
Democrats are pushing ahead of the Nov. 2 congressional
elections. Backers of the initiatives say they will reduce the
huge U.S. trade deficit with China and other countries by
bolstering American manufacturing firms.
 The National Association of Manufacturers, a top industry
group, said the Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 would
boost U.S. manufacturing output by $4.6 billion and support
about 90,000 jobs.
 Obama is to sign the bill at 2:40 p.m. EDT/(1840 GMT) and
will be joined by Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk, as well as by representatives from the
business community and the manufacturers' association.
 The global financial crisis led to a major slowdown in
trade, causing the U.S. trade deficit to shrink to $375 billion
in 2009 from $699 billion in 2008.
 As economic growth has returned, the trade gap has
increased again, hitting almost $200 billion in the first five
months of this year.

figures on the U.S. trade picture on Wednesday.

 * Court said Commerce must avoid ""double counting""
 * Similar case before the World Trade Organization
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department
is analyzing a court ruling that strikes at its ability to
simultaneously apply two sets of import duties on goods from
China, a department official said on Tuesday.
 ""My staff is still taking a look at that decision ... and
seeing what effect it will have,"" Commerce Undersecretary
Francisco Sanchez told Reuters.
 ""I'm not going to speculate until my staff and I have a
pretty clear understanding of where we're going,"" he said after
an event on U.S. government efforts to help expand trade
opportunities for minority businesses.
 Sanchez was reacting to a U.S. Court of International Trade
ruling last week that said the Commerce Department erred in its
application of both countervailing and anti-dumping duties on
off-road tires from China.
 The ruling, which many expect will be appealed, told the
department to ""forego the imposition of the countervailing duty
law"" in the case because it failed to show that it was not
penalizing China twice for the same trade action.
 Countervailing and anti-dumping duties are designed to
offset different foreign trade practices.
 The first are used to offset foreign government subsidies,
while the second are applied on imported goods sold in the
United States at less than fair market value.
 For years, the Commerce Department refused to use
countervailing duties against China on the grounds it was too
difficult to calculate subsidies in ""non-market economies.""
 Bowing to pressure from Congress, it changed that policy
several years ago and has since imposed countervailing duties
on a number of Chinese goods.
 The U.S. Court of International Trade previously upheld
that policy shift.
 But its latest ruling said the Commerce Department did not
take enough care in the tires case to avoid ""double counting,""
or punishing Chinese exporters twice for the same practice,
when both anti-dumping and countervailing duties are applied.
 That's because the Commerce Department uses third-country
prices -- instead of actual Chinese prices -- to calculate
anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods, as it is required under
U.S. law to do for non-market economies.
 China has also challenged the U.S. policy change at the
World Trade Organization, and a ruling in that case is expected
to be made public in coming months.
 One trade lawyer who asked not be be identified said the
United States is widely believed to have prevailed on the issue
of double counting in the WTO dispute.
 If true, that would put the U.S. Court of International
Trade ruling at odds with the WTO, he said.
 The lawyer said he expected the Commerce Department to
continue applying both countervailing and anti-dumping duties
on imports from China while fighting the U.S. Court of
International Trade ruling on appeal.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
yen on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced plans to
boost a flagging economy by reinvesting money from maturing
mortgage bonds in government debt.
 The central bank acknowledged economic growth had slowed in
recent months and reiterated its intention to hold benchmark
interest rates at record lows for an extended time.
 The move marked a policy shift for the Fed, which only a
few months ago debated how to start winding down some of its

 Worries about U.S. recovery pressured the dollar. So too
did prospects of lower U.S. rates which prompt Japanese funds
heavily invested in dollar-denominated Treasuries to repatriate
profits, benefitting the yen.
 Treasury prices rallied, led by longer-dated notes, pushing
down yields and undermining the dollar's appeal to investors.
The currency fell as low as 85.19 yen, near a 15-year trough.
 The euro briefly rose above $1.32, well off the day's low
but was still slightly weaker against the dollar on the day as
investors continued to book profits following last week's
gains in the single currency.
 For more on the fed, please see [id:nn09275781].
 The Fed's move and its downgrade to the economic outlook
""is a problem for the dollar in general,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The greenback has struggled mightily over the last month,
battered by signs of weaker U.S. growth and speculation the Fed
would move to boost stimulus for a flagging economy.
 However, strategists also noted the Fed's plans to reinvest
mortgage bond proceeds into long-dated Treasuries stops well
short of more aggressive, outright purchases of government or
mortgage debt.
 ""We got credit easing as opposed to quantitative easing,""
said Sebastien Galy, strategist BNP Paribas in New York, who
noted the policy shift doesn't expand the Fed's balance sheet.
 Earlier this year, the Fed wrapped up a more aggressive
asset-buying program with which it bought $300 billion in
Treasuries and nearly $1.3 trillion in mortgage-linked debt.
 ""The bond market had priced in expectations that they might
re-initiate asset buying and they did not do that,"" Dolan said.
""So ultimately, I expect to see U.S. rates move higher from
here and that would see the dollar come bouncing back.""
 The dollar fell 0.7 percent at 85.33 yen , near a
15-year low around 84.81 yen. The euro was last at $1.3181
, down 0.4 percent. It fell as low as $1.3075 earlier but
jumped to $1.3234 shortly after the Fed's announcement.
Sterling fell 0.3 percent to $1.5848 .
 The dollar got support against the yen earlier after the
Bank of Japan held off on new steps to weaken the strong
currency. [ID:nTKU106184]
 John Doyle, a strategist at Tempus Consulting in
Washington, said the euro still looks caught in a fairly tight
$1.30-$1.32 range, with moves above $1.32 hard to sustain.
 While the Fed's move is a modest one that will have little
impact on the money supply, it does suggest officials are
worried about the economy, said Vassili Serebriakov, strategist
at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""I would still describe this as a dovish statement and a
dovish move,"" he said. ""For the dollar, it all boils down to
how long this soft patch persists.""
 Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar clawed
its way back above its 200-day moving average of 80.835 <.DXY>,
though it remained more than 6 percent weaker since the start
of July.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2010 04:44PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Main points of Czech government programme," PRAGUE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The centre-right cabinet of Petr
Necas won a parliamentary confidence vote on Tuesday and said it
would use its mandate to cut spending and state debt and fix its
creaking pension and healthcare systems.
 Following are main points from the programme.
 
 BUDGET:
 * Balance the budget by 2016, provided the economy grows.
The deficit should be reduced to the EU limit of 3 percent of
GDP by 2013 at the latest, from 5.3 percent seen this year.
 * Adopt a constitutional law on budget discipline.
 * Establish a national budget council to monitor spending
and assess the impact of proposed bills on the budget.
 * Main savings measures for 2011: 
 - A 10 percent across-the-board cut in most operating
spending, including the state wage bill, excluding teachers. It
is estimated this should save 31 billion crowns ($1.65 billion).
 - Cut wages of senior officials and lawmakers by 5 percent.
 - Cut the annual state subsidy on home construction savings
accounts by half to 1,500 crowns per person, per year. This is
expected to save about 7 billion crowns.
 - Impose a 20 percent income tax on betting companies and
gambling houses, rather than the standard 19 percent.
 - Cut welfare benefits, reduce maternity leave, tighten
unemployment benefits, extend the period over which an employer
pays for sick leave for employees. This should bring 11 billion
crowns.
 
 PENSION REFORM
 * Build on conclusions of an expert commission which
recommended introducing another pillar to the pay-as-you-go
pension system in which workers would be obliged to pay into
private savings schemes. 
 * Use any privatisation proceeds and dividends from
state-held firms to capitalise the old pay-as-you-go pillar.
 
 PRIVATISATIONS:
 * Keep a qualified majority of 60 percent in power group CEZ
. The government now owns 69.8 percent.
 
 LABOUR CODE
 * Amend the labour code to make it easier to hire and fire.
 
 EUROPEAN UNION, EURO
 * Push for further enlargement of the European Union, with a
focus on southeastern Europe.
 * Push for creating a single European energy policy, and
diversification of resources.
 * Support adhering to the European Union's Growth and
Stability Pact rules and have sanctions for breaking them.
 * The programme does not include whether the government is
going to set a euro adoption date although parties had earlier
agreed not to do so.
 
 HEALTHCARE 
 * Split health coverage into standard care covered by state
insurance and above-standard treatment acquired through extra
contributions or private insurance.
 * Scrap a 30 crown fee for every prescribed drug in favour
of a single 30 crown fee for each prescription list. Patients
would have to pay full price for cheap drugs, such as aspirin,
that are subsidised now.
 * Raise the fee for a hospital stay to at least 100 crowns
($5.31) per day, from 60 crowns now.
 * Raise the fee paid for visiting a specialist doctor
without first visiting a general practitioner.
 
 EDUCATION
 * Introduce a university tuition fee of up to 20,000 crowns
a year as of 2013/14. Students would have to pay the fee after
graduation when their wages rise above the national average.
 * Transfer 2.1 billion crowns from the defence budget to
raise salaries of new teachers. Add another 4 billion crowns for
salaries in 2012.
 
 ENERGY 
 * Support construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline to bring
Caspian gas to Europe and the Gazela pipeline running from the
north of the Czech Republic to Germany. Gazela should connect to
Nord Stream, a planned sub-Baltic pipeline connecting Russia and
Germany, and to the OPAL pipeline in eastern Germany.
 * Push for diversification of energy resources to reduce
dependence on Russia.
 * Support enlargement of the Temelin nuclear power plant and
modernisation of the Dukovany nuclear plant, both run by
majority state-owned power firm CEZ.
 * Maintain existing territorial limits on brown coal mining.
 
 OTHER ISSUES
 * Change the constitution to allow for direct presidential
elections.

 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks lost ground but
finished the day well off earlier lows and government debt
rallied on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve signaled it would
act as necessary to preserve the fading economic recovery.
 The dollar lost luster as a haven from risk declining
against the yen, while crude oil prices trimmed losses.
 The Fed said it would begin funneling proceeds from its
maturing mortgage bonds into longer-term government debt in an
effort to support a sputtering economic recovery.
 The move marks an important policy shift for the Fed, which
just months ago had been debating how to start winding up its
various monetary stimulus programs. Fed officials also offered
a gloomier outlook on the U.S. economy.
 Strategists noted that reinvestment of mortgage proceeds
into long-dated Treasuries stops well short of more aggressive,
outright purchases of government or mortgage debt.
 The U.S. central bank, which left benchmark overnight
interest rates steady in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, also
renewed its pledge to keep rates low for an extended period, as
widely expected.
 The stock market's lukewarm response suggested investors
didn't believe the actions would have much immediate impact on
the weak labor market and consumer sector, two of the biggest
headwinds facing the recovery.
 ""The Fed is kind of caught in a spot where it isn't sure
what to do, so it went halfway,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief
market strategist at BTIG LLC in New York. ""This is an
insurance move, one it probably took grudgingly just to meet
market expectations.""
 Stocks and commodity prices earlier had slumped ahead of
the Fed's meeting and after a report of weak Chinese imports
triggered concern of slowing growth in China, which has been an
engine of growth for the world economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 54.50
points, or 0.51 percent, at 10,644.25. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 6.73 points, or 0.60 percent, at
1,121.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> closed lower 28.52
points, or 1.24 percent, at 2,277.17.
 The S&P rebounded back above its 200-day moving average.
All three major indexes had been down more than 1 percent
before the Fed's decision and on evidence that China's rapid
growth was easing.
 The S&P materials index <.GSPM> ended down 1.0 percent and
the energy index <.GSPE> was off 0.8 percent.
 In currency markets, the Fed's announcement weighed on the
dollar.
 The downgrade to the economic outlook ""is a problem for the
dollar in general,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey, while the move to invest
in long-dated Treasury debt has pushed down U.S. bond yields,
making the dollar less attractive to global investors.
 The euro was down 0.39 percent at $1.3181, after
falling as low as $1.3075 earlier. The dollar was down 0.65
percent at 85.36 yen , not far from a 15-year low around
84.81 yen. The dollar got support against the yen earlier after
the Bank of Japan held off on new steps to weaken the
currency.[ID:nTKU106184]
 FED MOVE STOKES BID FOR BONDS
 U.S. Treasuries prices rallied, extending earlier gains,
after the Federal Reserve said it will deploy principal
payments from its mortgage holdings to buy long-dated
government debt.
 The price on the 30-year U.S. government bond 
jumped 1-13/32 in the cash market. Its yield hit a session low
of 3.95 percent, compared with 4.02 percent late on Monday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  gained
19/32, with the yield at 2.7611 percent. The two-year U.S.
Treasury note  rose 1/32, with the yield at 0.5212
percent.
 U.S. crude oil futures ended with pared losses after the
Fed's pledge to maintain its policy of low interest rates for
an extended period.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude 
settled down $1.23, or 1.51 percent, at $80.25 a barrel. Before
the Fed announcement, crude prices were down about $1.80.
 Oil prices were stung by a slowdown in oil imports by
China, the world's second largest energy consumer, which
underlined investors' fears that the global economic recovery
is losing momentum.[ID:nTOE67904G]
 Although China's trade surplus surged in July to an
18-month high as exports rose, a government-induced slowdown in
investment took a toll on imports.
 ""China is certainly the global growth engine for almost all
parts of the world, especially to the United States. Their
macro data is influencing the psychology of investors of all
assets here,"" said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at
Jefferies & Co in New York.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> dropped 1.2 percent, and the Thomson Reuters
global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> fell 1.2 percent.
 The MSCI emerging markets benchmark <.MSCIEF> was down
1.18, with China's Shanghai Composite Index down 3 percent
after data showed Chinese import growth below expectations,
pointing to slowing domestic demand and economic activity.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300<.FTEU3> index closed 0.9
percent lower ahead of the Fed's policy statement, with miners
falling heavily.

 WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - New York Senator Charles
Schumer, an outspoken critic of Chinese trade policy, on
Tuesday seized on an unexpected surge in China's trade surplus
to renew his call for U.S. legislation to deal with Chinese
currency practices.
 ""These numbers show just how little motive China has to end
its currency manipulation unless it is pushed to do so,""
Schumer said in a statement after new data showed China's trade
surplus rose in July to an 18-month high of $28.7 billion.
 Schumer is one of the loudest critics in Congress of
China's currency practices, which he blames for scores of lost
U.S. manufacturing jobs.
 He leads a bipartisan group pressing for legislation that
would require the Commerce Department to apply countervailing
duties against countries with undervalued currencies.
 The lawmakers contend China's currency is undervalued by 25
percent to 40 percent against the U.S. dollar, giving Chinese
exporters an unfair price advantage.
 China loosened its currency, known as the yuan, from a near
two-year peg to the dollar on June 19. Since then, the yuan has
risen just 0.8 percent against the dollar.
 ""China's expanding trade surplus tells us two things.
First, China is back to its same old mercantilist tricks.

 By Manuela Badawy and Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pared earlier
steep losses and government debt rallied on Tuesday after the
Federal Reserve signaled it would act as necessary to preserve
the fading economic recovery.
 The dollar lost luster as a haven from risk, shedding early
gains versus the euro and declining against the yen, while
crude oil prices pared losses.
 The Fed said it would begin funneling proceeds from its
maturing mortgage bonds into longer-term government debt in an
effort to support a sputtering economic recovery.
 The move marks an important policy shift for the Fed, which
just months ago had been debating how to start winding up its
various monetary stimulus programs. Fed officials also offered
a more gloomy outlook on the U.S. economy.
 The Fed, which left benchmark overnight interest rates
steady in a zero to 0.25 percent range, also renewed its pledge
to keep them low for an extended period, as widely expected.
 ""What this is telling the market is, 'We're going to do
everything and anything we can to make sure we've put a
backstop on any possible risk of a double dip',"" said Burt
White, managing director and chief investment officer at LPL
Financial in Boston. ""This is exactly what the market was

 Stocks and commodity prices earlier had slumped after a
report of weak Chinese imports triggered concern of slowing
growth in China, which has been an engine of growth for the
world economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 36.86
points, or 0.34 percent, at 10,661.89. The Standard & Poor's

 The S&P rebounded back above its 200-day moving average.
All three major indexes had been down more than 1 percent
before the Fed's decision and on evidence that China's rapid
growth was easing.
 The S&P materials index <.GSPM> was down 0.9 percent and
the energy index <.GSPE> was off 0.8 percent.
 In currency markets, the Fed's announcement weighed on the
dollar.
 The downgrade to the economic outlook ""is a problem for the

making the dollar less attractive to global investors.
 The euro rose to $1.3223 , flat on the day, after
falling as low as $1.3075 earlier. The dollar was down 0.8
percent at 85.22 yen , not far from a 15-year low around
84.81 yen. The dollar got support against the yen earlier after
the Bank of Japan held off on new steps to weaken the
currency.[ID:nTKU106184]
 FED MOVE STOKES BID FOR BONDS
 U.S. Treasuries prices rallied, extending earlier gains,
after the Federal Reserve said it will deploy principal
payments from its mortgage holdings to buy long-dated
government debt.
 The price on the 30-year U.S. government bond 
jumped 1-13/32 in the cash market. Its yield hit a session low
of 3.95 percent, compared with 4.02 percent late on Monday.
 U.S. crude oil futures ended with pared losses after the
Fed's pledge to maintain its policy of low interest rates for
an extended period.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude 
settled down $1.23, or 1.51 percent, at $80.25 a barrel. Before
the Fed announcement, crude prices were down about $1.80.
 Oil prices were stung by a slowdown in oil imports by
China, the world's second largest energy consumer, which
underlined investors' fears that the global economic recovery
is losing momentum.[ID:nTOE67904G]
 Although China's trade surplus surged in July to an

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
yen on Tuesday and erased gains against the euro after the
Federal Reserve unveiled plans to boost a flagging economy by
reinvesting money from maturing mortgage bonds into government
debt.
 The move marks an important policy shift for the Fed, which
just months ago had been debating how to start winding up its
various monetary stimulus programs. Fed officials also offered
a more gloomy outlook on the U.S. economy.
 The downgrade to the economic outlook ""is a problem for the

not far from a 15-year low around 84.81. The dollar got support
against the yen earlier after the Bank of Japan held off on new
steps to weaken the strong currency.
 But while the Fed's move was seen as supportive for risky
assets and currencies, strategists said dollar selling may be
short-lived.
 ""The bond market had priced in expectations that they might
re-initiate asset buying and they did not do that,"" Dolan said.
""So ultimately, I expect to see U.S. rates move higher from
here and that would see the dollar come bouncing back.""
 John Doyle, senior strategist at Tempus Consulting in
Washington, said he expects the euro to have a hard time
holding its ground above $1.32 for long.
 The dollar has been under pressure for weeks on signs of
slower U.S. growth and amid speculation that the Fed could
adopt an even more aggressive asset-buying program targeting
Treasury and mortgage debt. The Fed wound up massive purchases
of government, agency and mortgage debt earlier this year.
 The Fed did reiterate its pledge to keep interest rates
very low for a long time. Low rates and accommodative monetary
conditions are often negative for a currency, partly because
they can increase its liquidity.

 * Victory for China in its first WTO dispute with EU
 BRUSSELS, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization
has condemned the way the European Union assesses duties on
unfairly priced imports in a complaint brought by China over
sales of screws and bolts, a person familiar with the case said
on Tuesday.
 The ruling, if confirmed, demolishes a key approach by
Brussels in dealing with imports from countries it deems not to
be market economies, such as China, Vietnam and Cuba.
 And it marks a victory for China -- the main target of
anti-dumping measures, or duties on imports judged to be sold
for less than they cost at home -- in its first trade dispute
against the European Union since joining the WTO in 2001.
 ""The panel has found that the EU discriminates against
Chinese exporters compared to exporters from other countries,""
said the person familiar with the case.
 ""It's a big victory for China as it takes out one of the
pillars of EU anti-dumping activity against China,"" he said.
 He was speaking after studying a confidential interim report
by a panel of WTO experts on the complaint, raised by China in
July last year, over anti-dumping duties on fasteners.
 A spokeswoman for the European Commission in Brussels
declined to comment as the ruling is still confidential.
 
 MIXED RULING
 The case involves duties of up to 85 percent, targeting
hundreds of Chinese companies selling components widely used for
cars, white goods and machinery worth some 575 million euros
($755 million) a year.
 The WTO issued the report to Brussels and Beijing on
Tuesday. Its final reports rarely differ from the interim
versions.
 The WTO panel ruled that that EU anti-dumping regulations
break international trading law and are discriminatory.
 In particular it rejected the EU's approach to non-market
economies, which effectively applies a single anti-dumping duty
to the whole country rather than for individual firms, unless
they can prove that they are independent of the state.
 It means that the EU must now set individual duties on
companies that want them, without unnecessary obstacles, instead
of imposing a blanket duty for the whole country.
 But the mixed ruling did not back all of China's claims, for
example dismissing Beijing's argument that Brussels made unfair
comparisons between high-end EU fasteners used in the car and
aviation industries with low-grade Chinese screws and bolts sold
in hardware shops.
 The dispute emerged last year as China overtook Germany to
become the world's biggest exporter. Its export prowess has
prompted a series of complaints and trade measures just when
political leaders have been warning of the dangers of
protectionism.
 But for the entire history of the WTO since 1995, China has
been by far the biggest target of anti-dumping investigations,
even before it joined the global trade body.
 In 2009 China was the target of 77 anti-dumping
investigations out of a total of 201, and in the first four
months of this year it was targeted in 12 out of 39 cases, WTO
figures show.
 Brussels argued it had followed all the rules on
anti-dumping when it imposed the duties in January 2009.
 The EU duties exempted subsidiaries of two European
companies -- Spain's Celo and Italy's Agrati -- leading China to
argue that they were discriminatory.
 Several Chinese producers and European importers have
challenged the duties in EU courts, including Ningbo Yonghong
Fasteners, Gem-Year Industrial, Shanghai Prime Machinery and
Germany's Adolf Wuerth.
 Beijing subsequently slapped its own anti-dumping duties of
up to 24.6 percent on European fasteners in December after
Chinese manufacturers complained that EU-made screws were
undercutting them unfairly.
 Brussels launched a formal complaint about that move at the
WTO in May.
 The final report is expected to be issued to the parties
next month and published in November, after which each side will
have 60 days to appeal.

 * 2011 budget next important task
 * S&P raises country's outlook to positive on fiscal plans

(Updates with vote delay, analyst, S&P)
 By Jason Hovet and Robert Mueller
 PRAGUE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The new centre-right Czech
government looks certain to win a confidence vote in the lower
house, clearing an early hurdle as it seeks to push tough budget
cuts and reforms through parliament.
 Lawmakers opened debate on the three-party coalition on
Tuesday, but a vote that had been expected in the evening was
now not likely to come before Wednesday.
 The government aims to deliver on an election promise to
slash spending and improve a fiscal position analysts say is
already among the best in central Europe. 
 That has made Czech government bonds and the crown safe
havens in a volatile region.
 Standard & Poor's ratings agency raised its outlook for the
European Union member to positive on Tuesday, reflecting what it
said was the likelihood of an upgrade in the next two years if
the new government implemented its fiscal plans.
 But the coalition must balance a 10 percent cut to the
public wage bill and lower welfare benefits with an unemployment
rate of 8.7 percent and worries that belt tightening may stifle
an export-led recovery that has largely bypassed consumers.
 The right-of-centre Civic Democrats, the conservative TOP09
and centrist Public Affairs have the largest majority of any
government since the creation of the Czech Republic in 1993
after winning 118 seats in the 200-member lower house in May.
 While the coalition has run into a minor dispute over which
ministries will face the largest budget cuts, analysts say Prime
Minister Petr Necas' government will easily win the vote, a
constitutional requirement to stay in power. 
 Charles University political analyst Petr Just said a
situation where coalition partners were so close on issues while
holding a strong majority was exceptional in Czech politics, but
added coalition cracks would remain a reality.
 ""These cracks will always appear,"" Just said. ""(But) none of
the three parties want the government to be crowded out by the
(opposition) Social Democrats or the need for early elections.""
 
 BELT TIGHTENING
 Clawing its way out of a 4.0 percent economic contraction
last year, the government expects 2010 growth of 1.6 percent.
 The next major task will be drawing up a 2011 budget, in
which the coalition aims to cut the fiscal deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product from 5.3 percent this year.
 The government aims to hit the EU's 3 percent fiscal deficit
ceiling by 2013, while keeping in check an overall public debt
burden of around 38 percent of GDP -- about half the EU average.
 Standard & Poor's said the country's political commitment to
fiscal measures, including plans to tackle financing of a
pension system whose debt is set to grow with an ageing
population, was ""significantly higher than in the past"".
 ""The positive outlook reflects the likelihood of an upgrade
if the government legislates social security reform that lessens
ageing-related expenditure pressures,"" S&P said.
 Prague's cost cutting contrasts with other countries in
central Europe. In Poland, tough reforms are likely to be put
off until after an election next year while the new Hungarian
government, defying the IMF and the EU, is looking to soften
next year's budget goal.
 The government's commitment to austerity has been partly
behind the crown's rise to 21-month peaks against the euro this
month, while the benchmark 9-year bond yield has dropped to a
lifetime low.

economic weakness and signal a willingness to take more steps

 Investors began to reassess their expectations overnight.
Some see the Fed taking minor steps such as reinvesting funds

 The euro  fell as low as $1.3090 on electronic

FOMC statement or announce any restarting of quantitative
easing,"" said Amelia Bourdeau, a currency strategist at UBS AG
in Stamford, Connecticut. ""Dollar shorts are being covered, so

 The euro fell as low as $1.3074 on electronic trading
platform EBS. It was last down 1.1 percent at $1.3086 ,
retreating from a three-month peak of $1.3334 hit on EBS on
Friday.
 The euro's decline accelerated after it fell below
trendline support on hourly charts near $1.3200, with stop-loss
orders also adding to the drop. Declines in U.S. stocks added
to weakness in the currency.
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.9 percent to 81.409,
climbing above its 200-day moving average around 80.835 on
Tuesday and indicating a decreased selling signal. Dollar
weakness late last week had pushed it below that key level.
 Steps by the Fed could consist of a pledge to consider more
quantitative easing, reinvesting money from maturing debt into
Treasuries or mortgage-based securities, cutting interest paid
on excess reserves and buying financial assets outright.

 Accommodative monetary conditions are often negative for a
currency, partly because they can increase its liquidity.
 Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in
New York, said the dollar ""may see a further relief rally on
any news"" that additional quantitative easing is off the table
for now.
 YEN STRENGTH
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in
London, said the most likely outcome is ""a disappointing market
reaction"" to the Fed announcement, which would include only ""a
reference to asset purchases"" instead of ""an actual
implementation of asset purchases.""
 In such a scenario, he expects to see profit-taking in the
stock market and yen strength to overtake any dollar gains. The
Australian dollar, sterling and the Canadian dollar will be
among the biggest losers, he said.
 ""The Fed won't be able to do much at this point. In our
view, a second round of quantitative easing would be a mistake.
It would send a signal they are really worried about the U.S.
economy,"" said Piero Ghezzi, head of economics, emerging
markets and FX research at Barclays Capital.
 Against the yen, the dollar was flat at 85.88 .
 The dollar had earlier dipped to the day's lows against the
yen around 85.65 after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
said no major central bank targets currency levels. He also
said the central bank's board spent much time debating the
recent rise in the yen and how it could affect business
sentiment. [ID:nTKU106184]
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.1 percent
and held off on new policy steps, as expected. [ID:nTKU106183]
 Market players said there were substantial stop-loss orders
just under options barriers at 85 yen, with more stops sitting
below 84.82 yen. A fall below 84.82 yen would take the dollar
to a 15-year low against the yen.

 By Christiaan Hetzner 
 FRANKFURT, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Struggling printing press
maker Heidelberger set out a future as an independent
manufacturer, backed by the firepower of a 420 million euro
rights issue and the prospects of recovery from improving
currency trends.
 The world's top supplier of printing presses was rescued by
a government loan last year and came under pressure from key
shareholder Allianz to join a sector consolidation drive.
 But suitor manroland, the world's second largest
manufacturer, abandoned merger plans after losses at
Heidelberger unexpectedly ballooned.
 Heidelberger management has shown no signs of revisiting
merger scenarios that would be fiercely opposed by German unions
and be met with suspicion by cartel regulators.
 Chief Executive Bernhard Schreier told a second-quarter
earnings conference call on Tuesday he would keep clear of any
potential merger discussions within the industry, which has been
buffeted by a shift to online media in core western markets.
 When asked to confirm that Heidelberger was not involved in
consolidation stalks at present, he replied: ""The statement is
correct the way you just made it.""
 ""I've always said our industry would do well with a
consolidation, regardless of where, since all would profit,"" he
said.
 ""So I am very interested to see what happens in the future,""
he said.
 In Tuesday's Handelsblatt newspaper, Koenig & Bauer (KBA)
CEO Helge Hansen publicly wooed manroland while ruling out any
interest in a deal with the larger, heavily indebted
Heidelberger.
 ""Any deal involving Heidelberg would be so problematic from
a cartel point of view that it would likely only proceed if the
companies were in an existential crisis. But now the bottom has
clearly been reached and the trend is pointing up,"" said one
sell-side equity analyst based in Germany.
 Investors including Allianz last month approved a capital
hike to bolster Heidelberg's balance sheet. The capital increase
is due no later than January.
 One person familiar with the matter said Allianz had decided
not to conduct any discussions over mergers at present.
 ""It's not the right time for an exit,"" the source said.
 
 FLAGGING U.S.
 Considered a bellwether of the German capital goods sector,
a strong euro meant Heidelberger struggled to overcome flagging
demand in the United States.
 But with Japanese competitors like Komori and Mitsubishi
Heavy suffering from a strong yen, Heidelberger says it can now
afford to watch a wave of consolidation from the sidelines.
 ""For three, four years the yen was trading at 150-170 (to
the euro), where we had a considerable handicap to compete for
customers on the price,"" finance chief Dirk Kaliebe. 
 ""With the economy recovering, the Germans (Heidelberger,
manroland and KBA) have a competitive advantage,"" he said.
 Schreier said there was one market that was not ramping up
its orders despite 2010 being an election year that typically
boosts demand for printed material: the United States.
 ""For the next three, maybe even six months, I do not see any
real improvement there even though all other regions of the
world are developing dramatically better,"" he explained.
 Heidelberger expects to break even on an operating level in
the current 2010/11 fiscal year, but will see a ""significant""
net loss due to higher costs resulting from refinancing a
low-rate convertible bond with expensive state loan guarantees.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - World stocks slumped and the
dollar rose broadly on Tuesday on weak Chinese data and
uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will take
aggressive action to help the faltering economic recovery.
 U.S. Treasury prices rose in a flight to quality ahead of
the central bank decision, and commodity prices fell after data
showed Chinese imports slowed in July.
 The euro extended losses against the dollar to trade more
than 1 percent lower as the greenback was boosted by a growing
view the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee was unlikely to
announce any aggressive easing measures.
 The Fed is not expected to shift interest rates from the
current level near zero, but is seen acknowledging recent
economic weakness and signal a willingness to take more steps
to support the softening recovery. The Fed will issue a
statement at about 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT).
 Investors began to reassess their expectations overnight.
Some see the Fed taking minor steps such as reinvesting funds
to maintain its balance sheet, while others say it will adopt a

 The euro fell as low as $1.3090  on electronic

 The S&P 500 fell below its 200-day moving average ahead of
the Fed statement. The 200-day moving average, now at 1,115.50,
is a widely followed technical signal, and if it closes below
that point, it could indicate a turnaround in market momentum.

 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose across
the board on Tuesday as investors scaled back expectations the

 Speculation had been growing that the U.S. central bank

 * Prices at 1986 levels even after rally
 * EU aid more than 30 percent of farm income
 * Plantings down 10 percent since 2002
 * Carbon farming, biofuels may help
By Martin Roberts
 MADRID, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The European Union's proposed
overhaul of its farm support policy is likely to push grain
farmers out of business in Spain, hitting security of its food
supplies, its import bill and farmers' living standards.
 Farmers are concerned that the EU is planning to remove
direct subsidies when it overhauls the 50 billion euro a year
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2013.
 Spanish grain farming is unsustainable without support from
Brussels. Wheat and barley farmers have been hamstrung for
centuries by poor soils and a harsh climate. While yields have
risen in recent years, they are still usually just one-third as
much per hectare as levels in France.
 ""Scrapping or further dismantling of the CAP would have an
irreparable negative impact on Spanish farming. CAP aid accounts
for 30 percent of farm income, and more for cereals and
oilseeds,"" said Luis Lopez Bellido, professor of crop science at
the University of Cordoba.
 Farm-gate prices have barely moved in decades while costs
have soared, and Spain's heavy dependency on imports has grown.
 A recent rally in grain prices, due mostly to a Russian
drought and export ban, may provide temporary financial relief.
Wheat prices have recently risen as high as 180 euros a tonne in
Castilla-Leon.
 Even so, farmers note that prices are now no higher than
they were in 1986, when Spain joined the forerunner to the
European Union, while input costs such as diesel have since
risen 2.5 times.
 For many crisis-hit farmers, whose finances are already on a
knife-edge, the rally has come too late, said Jose Vazquez, a
crop technician with Asaja.
 He estimated that many growers of durum wheat had already
sold at 140 euros ($184.10)/tonne, below a break-even figure of
180 euros.
 ""The bounce will benefit 60 to 70 percent of farmers,"" while
the rest had sold before the rally to pay their bankers, he
said. ""They had no choice.""
 
 DECOUPLING
 Farmers say the CAP gives good value for money, because it
guarantees food supplies for 500 million Europeans and costs the
average EU family 2 euros a week.
 ""We consider the goals which led to the creation of the CAP
such as food supply and improving farmers' living standards, are
still valid,"" the COAG union said in a recent statement.
 Thousands of Spanish farmers rallied in June outside a
meeting of EU farm ministers, which Spain hosted as rotating
president of the 27-country bloc, to demand continuing aid after
2013.
 The Asaja union estimates that growing a hectare of wheat or
barley in Spain's northern Castilla-Leon grain belt costs 362
euros. 
 This means that with yields of 2.67 tonnes per hectare,
farmers just break even by selling wheat at a typical 136 euros
a tonne and make a loss by selling barley at 118 euros.
 By comparison, despite a decline from last year due to
drought, French farmers are expected to harvest an average yield
of 6.98 tonnes/hectare in 2010.
 Lopez Bellido said farmers were already discouraged when the
EU removed the direct link between subsidies and production in
2003.
 ""When farmers do their sums, they say what do I produce? I
can't do more than 2.5 or 3 (tonnes/hectare). What does it cost?
Then there is huge price volatility, so they say I cannot grow
or I use less inputs, which leads to technical inefficiency, and
they give up,"" he said.
 Agriculture Ministry figures show that cereal plantings in
Spain have already declined by 10.9 percent 2002. 
 Meanwhile, imports have risen to 13.3 million tonnes last
year from 8.2 million in 2001. Spain buys cereal from as far
afield as Argentina and Kazakhstan.
 
 CARBON FARMING
 To survive, Spanish farmers need to boost yields by using
new crop varieties and improved technology as well as other
strategies such as creating service companies to raise economies
of scale, Lopez Bellido said.
 A reformed CAP also could help farmers if it supported what
Lopez Bellido called ""carbon farming"". Farmers would get a
subsidy for growing alternative crops such as thistles on what
would otherwise be waste land, which would act as a carbon sink
and provide raw material for producing biofuels.
 ""There are many plants in Spain that are practically wild
and grow well in our climatic conditions, such as our famous
thistles,"" he said.
 ""We have second-generation biofuels, which use a known
enzyme process to extract bioethanol and biodiesel from the
cellulose in straw,"" he added.

 BTM UFJ analysts said it would be difficult for Japan to

fundamentals, they said.

 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - British house prices fell last
month and retail sales growth slowed abruptly, surveys showed on
Tuesday, hitting the pound and raising concern that the recovery
may be losing momentum.
 A narrower trade deficit was the one bright spot in an
otherwise gloomy batch of data, but even here analysts noted
that weaker domestic demand could be holding back imports.
 The signs of a faltering recovery highlight the dilemma
facing the Bank of England, which has kept interest rates at a
record low for more than a year despite above-target inflation.
 The central bank will publish updated quarterly forecasts on
Wednesday that could make for unpalatable reading. Not only is
it likely to revise down its 2011 growth forecasts, largely as a
result of the fiscal tightening announced in the government's
June budget, it is also likely to admit inflation will stay
above target for a second straight year.
 ""Today's data releases are not good news for growth,"" said
Alan Clarke, UK economist at BNP Paribas. ""The consumer was
already facing a challenging year, and a renewed housing
downturn will only add to that.""
 The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' house price
balance logged its first negative reading in a year, falling to
-8 in the three months to July from a downwardly revised +8 in
the three months to June.
 Worryingly, surveyors were bracing for even worse to come,
with the price expectations balance falling from -6 to -28, its
lowest since April 2009.
 Sterling fell 1 percent on the day versus the dollar in the
wake of the data, touching a one-week low of $1.5736.
 
 CONFIDENCE QUESTION
 Falling house prices would put further pressure on banks'
balance sheets, crimping their ability to lend to households and
businesses. With many Britons mortgaged to the hilt, consumer
confidence would also take a knock.
 A survey from the British Retail Consortium showed the value
of sales last month was just 0.5 percent higher than a year ago
on a like-for-like basis, less than half the 1.2 percent growth
recorded in June. 
 ""The overriding factor is consumer confidence -- it's fallen
recently,"" said Stephen Robertson, Director General of the BRC.
 ""Talk of public spending cuts is unsettling customers and
they are concentrating on essentials."" 
 Britain's economy grew an unexpectedly strong 1.1 percent
from April to June but most economists think that will be the
high water mark, with growth slowing for the remainder of the
year.
 A narrowing in Britain's trade gap in June provided a
glimmer of hope that an export-led recovery might still be
possible. But analysts were sceptical whether exports could
suddenly become the engine of British growth, particularly when
the global recovery was also looking fragile.
 ""We continue to doubt that any trade boost will be big
enough in the near term to offset the effects of the severe
fiscal squeeze on consumers and the domestic economy,"" said
Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics.
 The Bank of England has kept UK interest rates at a record
low of 0.5 percent since March 2009. With the economic outlook
so uncertain, investors are betting this policy paralysis will
continue until well into 2011.

 Following are some of the other labour actions this year:
 * One of the year's most costly strikes was a three-week
rail and port walkout at the state logistics group Transnet in
May that cost the economy about $1 billion in lost production
and sales. Unions said they won an 11 percent pay increase.
 * Workers who comprise the bulk of the workforce at state
power utility Eskom in June won a 9 percent wage increase and a
1,500 rand housing allowance after threatening a strike that
could have cut electricity during the World Cup.
 * About 30,000 autoworkers seeking a 15 percent wage hike
went on strike in August, dealing a blow to production in the
Africa's biggest car-making state. They accepted a three-year
deal, with workers receiving a 10 percent increase this year,
and 9 percent a year in the next two years.
 * Richards Bay Minerals, a Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton joint
venture, this week reached a wage deal to end a week-long
strike. RBM says it agreed to an 8 percent pay rise with the
National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) for 2010 and a 7 percent
increase each for 2011 and 2012.
 * The NUM said that more than 8,000 workers seeking 15
percent pay increases at Northam Platinum would go on strike on
Monday.
 * About 6,000 unionised tyre and rubber workers went on
strike this week.
 * About 70,000 workers at petrol stations, garages and auto
dealerships went on strike this week, seeking 20 percent wage
increases.
 * About 5,000 employees at the company's Zondereinde mine
stopped work for a day in July to protest what they say are
inadequate safety measures.

 LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Tuesday as
traders trimmed short positions, awaiting the result of the U.S.
Federal Reserve's policy meeting amid speculation of further
easing to shore up a flagging U.S. economy.
 Market players expect a dovish tone from the Fed but are
divided as to how far it would go to back up its words with
action. Some see the Fed taking minor steps such as reinvesting
funds to maintain its balance sheet, but not going back to
full-fledged quantitative easing.
 The dollar reversed losses posted last week after weak U.S.
payrolls cranked up expectations the Fed may ease monetary
policy. Accommodative monetary conditions are often negative for
a currency partly because they can increase its liquidity.
 ""We're seeing some squaring up of short positions ahead of
the Fed, and there is some risk-off sentiment as well as Asian
stocks closed lower, prompting a selloff in high yielders such
as the Australian dollar,"" said Christian Lawrence, currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 European shares <.FTEU3> slipped 0.8 percent, following a
slide in Asian stock prices. This helped to push the New Zealand
dollar down roughly 1 percent on the day versus its U.S.
counterpart , while the Australian dollar  fell
0.6 percent.
 By 1022 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.6 percent from late U.S.
trade on Monday to $1.3150 , retreating from a three-month
peak of $1.3334 hit on Friday on trading platform EBS.
 The euro's decline accelerated after falling below trendline
support on hourly charts near $1.3200, with stop-loss orders
also adding to the drop.
 Still, support was seen at $1.3125, the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its November 2009-June 2010 fall.
 The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.6 percent to 81.168, rising
above its 200-day moving average around 80.835 on Tuesday and
indicating a decreased selling signal. Dollar weakness late last
week had pushed it below that key level.
Steps by the Fed could range from a pledge to consider more
quantitative easing, reinvesting money from maturing debt into
Treasuries or mortgage-based securities, cutting interest paid
on excess reserves, and buying financial assets outright.
[ID:nN09301078]
 Its decision is due around 1815 GMT.
 
 YEN EDGES UP
 The yen was the exception to the dollar's broad rebound as
it edged up against the greenback. Traders in Tokyo cited talk
of fund repatriation by Japanese investors related to coupon
payments of U.S. Treasuries due in mid-August.
 The dollar dipped to the day's lows against the yen around
85.65 yen after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said no
major central bank targets currency levels. He also said the
central bank's board spent much time debating the recent rise in
the yen and how it could affect business sentiment.
[ID:nTKU106184]
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.1 percent
and held off on new policy steps, as expected. [ID:nTKU106183]
 BTM UFJ analysts said it would be difficult for Japan to
justify acting to stem yen strength given that the currency's
recent rise versus the dollar had been orderly. It would also be
hard to argue the move had been out of line with economic
fundamentals, they said.
 ""With the near-term risk of renewed BOJ monetary easing or
yen intervention still low, the yen's upward advance should
continue unimpeded,"" they said in a note.
 The dollar was a touch lower at 85.85 yen , holding
above last Friday's eight-month low of 85.02 yen.
 Market players said there were substantial stop-loss orders
just under options barriers at 85 yen, with more stops sitting
below 84.82 yen. A fall below 84.82 yen would take the dollar to
a 15-year low against the yen.

(Adds reaction)
 LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Britain's goods trade deficit
narrowed more than expected to a four-month low in June as
exports jumped, rekindling previously forlorn hopes the economy
might be rebalancing.
 However, economists remained cautious.
 The Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday the goods
gap shrank to 7.401 billion pounds from 8.028 billion in May.
Analysts had forecast a drop to 7.8 billion pounds.
 The deficit with non-EU countries narrowed to 4.262 billion
pounds from 4.492 billion, broadly as expected.
 The total trade deficit, which includes services, narrowed
to 3.260 billion pounds from a 22-month high of 3.818 billion in
May. As with the goods deficit, this was the best reading since
February.
 Britain's trade performance has been disappointing of late,
with sterling's slide since 2007 having failed to offset weaker
demand from Britain's trading partners.
 Tuesday's figures rekindled hopes that a long-awaited
rebalancing of the economy could still happen, though analysts
were reluctant to read too much into one month's release of what
is often a volatile series.
 ""It's certainly a major improvement on what we've seen in
recent months,"" said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank.
""I guess it's an indication that the UK economy is getting a bit
of an uplift from exports, but also as the economy slows a bit,
there's a bit less imports.""
 Goods exports to non-EU countries were the highest on record
at 10.750 billion pounds and exports to the world as a whole
were the highest since July 2008 at 22.444 billion pounds.
 The improvement in the global goods trade deficit was driven
by stronger oil and chemical exports and reduced imports of
cars.
 A breakdown by country showed the biggest improvement in
export performance was to the United States, while the biggest
rise in imports was from Norway.
 Overall, the value of UK goods exports rose 4.3 percent on
the month, while the value of goods imported into Britain rose
1.0 percent.

 * Engine makers fight for supremacy in new engine war
 
 By Rhys Jones and Tim Hepher
 LONDON/PARIS, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing are
sweating this summer over whether to upgrade their best-selling
aircraft with new, more efficient engines, a move which could
reshape the $80-billion jetliner industry.
 Billions of dollars in profits and trade balances are at
stake as they act to fend off emerging competition from Canada,
China and Russia.
 Behind them the world's leading narrow-body engine makers --
Britain's Rolls-Royce, U.S. groups General Electric and Pratt &
Whitney and France's Safran -- battle for supremacy over the
next wave of technology.
 With aviation staging a fragile recovery from recession, big
planemakers are under pressure to provide savings in fuel.
 But each must do so without damaging the resale value of
jets already in the market, as control of the industry steadily
passes to the financiers or 'Wall Street pilots' running the
leasing industry.
 ""Narrow-body planes are the cash cow of Airbus and Boeing's
businesses. The consequences of what they do are profound,"" said
Les Weal, a director at UK-based aviation consultancy Ascend.
 Act too soon or attack old designs too aggressively and they
risk upsetting the value of a backlog of 4,200 undelivered
short- or medium-haul jets worth $300 billion at list prices.
 Move too late and they risk leaving themselves at the mercy
of the next technological leap expected next decade.
 Until now, the world's top two planemakers have resisted
changing winning designs that raked in thousands of sales of
short-haul jets and gave birth to the low-cost airline industry.
 But they are being forced to defend their duopoly as
newcomers like Bombardier chip away at the 100-200 seat market,
helped by engines that already offer big savings.
 The solution being pondered by Airbus and Boeing is a switch
to similar new engines on existing planes. A final decision from
both companies is expected by the year-end.
 This could offer fuel savings of some 12-15 percent from
2015, pending a deeper and more noticeable shake-up of engine
design that could cut costs by up to 30 percent from 2025-27.
 Such a move only makes sense if the short-term or tactical
engine is allowed a long enough production run -- most estimate
10 years -- to make its development worthwhile.
 
 MARKETING HEADACHE
 With greater reliance on slim-margin single-aisle jet sales,
Airbus is expected to move first to defend its A320 range.
 But CEO Tom Enders -- fearing a repeat of costly delays on
the A350 and A380 -- is asking tough questions about resources.
 The EADS board too has received a presentation on the
approximately $1 billion ""re-engining"" scheme but is unwilling
to take a decision without a detailed roll call of engineers.
 That caused a headache for Airbus marketers at last month's
Farnborough Airshow. They managed to buy time from airlines
close to buying Bombardier's C-Series. For now, the plan seems
to have worked as Canada's campaign at the show bombed with no
sale.
 ""There are two ways of interpreting this,"" said Teal Group
consultant Richard Aboulafia of the Farnborough order book.
 ""Either that Airbus and to a lesser extent Boeing were able
to block the C-Series by promising alternatives with new engines
very soon, or that this industry has been taken over by people
who are happy with the status quo.""
 Most analysts believe Airbus is likely to re-engine the
A320, and expect Boeing to follow suit with the 737.
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive James Albaugh
rejected the notion that it is waiting for Airbus, but in
practice analysts say moving second may be more comfortable.
 If it passes on the re-engine idea, it would be gambling
that the next generation might be ready sooner than Airbus
thinks, and would grab the advantage if this assumption were
right because Airbus would be stuck with less efficient
re-engined planes.
 But so far only Rolls-Royce is said to take an optimistic
view on the early arrival of new engine technology.
 Leeham Co analyst Scott Hamilton said a re-engining would
cost Airbus $1-1.5 billion and Boeing about twice that, but this
compares with $10-15 billion for an all-new airplane project.
 Resale values of Boeing 737s did not suffer as badly as most
feared when Boeing last overhauled the design in the 1990s.
 A bigger concern may be that airlines start to hold off
buying planes from as early as 2020, half way through the desired
production run, in anticipation of new gains around the corner.
 Despite these risks, Airbus watchers say it has all but made
up its mind to 're-engine' barring any surprises on resources.
 This decision and Boeing's response may well affect the
shifting alliances of the world's top engine firms.
 Relevant plane engines are dominated by two transatlantic
alliances: CFM, a Safran-General Electric partnership, which has
a monopoly on the 737, and a younger and more dispersed grouping
fostered by Airbus called International Aero Engines (IAE).
 IAE leaders Pratt and Rolls-Royce appear split on whether it
makes sense to invest in the short-term tactical engine, and so
far Pratt is marketing its new ""geared turbofan"" alone. 
 Its engine has so far won over a majority of new entrants in
Canada, Russia and Japan. CFM's rival Leap-X engine has won the
attention of a future Chinese challenger to Airbus and Boeing.
 Rolls, which is pioneering open-rotor technology, is widely
said to favour going to work on a strategic new engine. But
Robert Nuttall, vice president of strategic marketing, said it
would ""never say never"" to a re-design.

 By Jason Hovet and Robert Mueller
 PRAGUE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The new centre-right Czech
government looks certain to win a confidence vote in the lower
house on Tuesday, clearing an early hurdle as it seeks to push
tough budget cuts and reforms through parliament.
 The three-party coalition aims to deliver on an election
promise to slash spending and improve a fiscal position analysts
say is already among the best in central Europe. 
 That has made Czech government bonds and the crown safe
havens in a volatile region.
 But it must balance a 10 percent cut to the public wage bill
and lower welfare benefits with an unemployment rate of 8.7
percent and worries that belt tightening may stifle an
export-led recovery that has largely bypassed consumers.
 The right-of-centre Civic Democrats, the conservative TOP09
and centrist Public Affairs have the largest majority of any
government since the creation of the Czech Republic in 1993
after winning 118 seats in the 200-member lower house in May.
 While the coalition has run into a minor dispute over which
ministries will face the largest budget cuts, analysts say Prime
Minister Petr Necas' government will easily win Tuesday's vote,
a constitutional requirement for it to stay in power.
 Clawing its way out of a 4.0 percent economic contraction
last year, the government expects 2010 growth of 1.6 percent.
 The next major task will be drawing up a 2011 budget, in
which the coalition aims to cut the fiscal deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product from 5.3 percent this year.
 The government aims to hit European Union's 3 percent fiscal
deficit ceiling by 2013, a goal it hopes will help keep in check
an overall public debt burden of around 38 percent of GDP --
about half the EU average.
 Prague's cost cutting contrasts with other countries in
central Europe. In Poland, tough reforms are likely to be put
off until after a general election next year while the new
Hungarian government, defying the IMF and the EU, is looking to
soften next year's budget goal.
 Public Affairs initially opposed plans to freeze ministries'
spending to help meet the 2010 budget target. October municipal
and Senate elections may also cause extended budget wrangling.
 The government's commitment to austerity has been partly
behind the crown's rise to 21-month peaks against the euro this
month, while the benchmark 9-year bond yield has dropped to a
lifetime low.

(Adds home affairs statement, analyst comment)
 By Jon Herskovitz and Ed Cropley
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - South Africa public sector
unions representing more than a million workers staged a one-day
strike on Tuesday, threatening an extended labour stoppage this
week that could deal a blow to Africa's largest economy.
 Tuesday's action increases pressure on President Jacob
Zuma's government to reach a deal by a Thursday deadline set by
the unions to prevent a repeat of a prolonged public sector
strike three years ago that dented the economy and damaged
support for Zuma's predecessor.
 Marches were held in Cape Town and Pretoria, South Africa's
administrative capital, as part of a ""total shut-down of the
public service"", according to the country's largest umbrella
labour organisation COSATU.
 Everything from schools to public offices was affected,
although essential services such as police and hospitals were
running on reduced staffing.
 The Department of Home Affairs said immigration services at
ports and airports had not been affected and measures had been
taken at major airports to ensure minimal disruption.
 
 TALKS TO RESUME
 Unions and government negotiators planned talks later in the
day, after the protest marches were over, union officials said.
 ""In a strike of this magnitude it is difficult to make
sufficient contingency plans to ensure business runs as usual
but we have employed contract workers to make sure government
departments will not be closed,"" said Dumisani Nkwamba, a
spokesman for the public service ministry.
 Unions want an 8.6 percent pay hike, twice the current rate
of inflation, and a 1,000 rand ($138) monthly housing allowance.
 ""Failure to meet these demands by 12 August 2010 will result
in indefinite labour action by all unions until the demands are
met,"" COSATU-affiliated unions said in a statement.
 The government is offering 7 percent and 630 rand for
housing, although analysts believe it is likely to raise its
offer rather than risk a walk-out that would damage the economy.
 ""I think in two weeks or so it will be finished. If the
strike keeps going on past September, then they are dangerous,""
said Gary van Staden, a political analyst at independent
economists NKC.
 Analysts expect the ruling African National Congress, which
has a longstanding alliance with organised labour, to give in to
the unions' demands. But such a deal will make it hard to bring
the deficit down from 6.7 percent of GDP without spending
cutbacks elsewhere.
 The government, which budgeted for wage increases based on a
5.2 percent inflation projection, has not said how much more it
would spend under its offer or the deal sought by the unions.
 In an indication of how costly the deal could be, just the
1,000 rand monthly housing allowance sought by the unions could
account for more than one percent of the state budget.
 The government said its offer package would amount to an
average 9 percent increase for 1.3 million unionised public
servants. 
 A mid-grade public sector employee makes on average 8,800
rand a month in salary and benefits, above the national average
wage of 6,383 rand, according to government figures.
 The central bank has also expressed concern about elevated
pay increases stoking inflation in the wider economy, putting
upward pressure on interest rates.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar rose and world stocks
slipped on Tuesday as investors stayed cautious ahead of likely
moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve to warn about and possibly
prop up a faltering economic recovery.
 Commodity prices eased after data showed Chinese imports
slowed in July.
 Speculation has been growing that the U.S. central bank will
at its meeting later on Tuesday signal a need for more stimulus
to support growth or possibly restart asset purchases, as data
since the Fed's last policy-setting meeting in late June has
been weak.
 U.S. consumer spending is petering out and manufacturing is
losing steam, while the unemployment rate is stuck at 9.5
percent.
 Mere acknowledgement of a blip might disappoint some
investors who have been betting the Fed would make a more
concrete move, such as buying bonds to pull down market rates,
known as quantitative easing.
 ""We're seeing some squaring up of short positions ahead of
the Fed, and there is some risk-off sentiment as well as Asian
stocks closed lower, prompting a sell-off in high yielders such
as the Australian dollar,"" said Christian Lawrence, currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.3153 , sterling
slipped 1 percent to $1.5749  and the Australian dollar
was down 0.7 percent at $0.9103 .
 The dollar advanced 0.5 percent against a basket of
currencies <.DXY>. Against the yen the greenback was down 0.1
percent at 85.87 yen .
 The Bank of Japan on Tuesday held off on new policy steps to
combat a stronger yen, saving its limited firepower in case the
currency's rise accelerates and threatens the country's fragile
recovery.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> eased 0.7 percent, and the Thomson Reuters
global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> fell 0.6 percent.
 
 CHINESE SIGNALS
 The MSCI emerging markets benchmark <.MSCIEF> dropped 1
percent, with China's Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> down 2.9
percent after data showed Chinese import growth below
expectations, pointing to slowing domestic demand and economic
activity.
 EPFR Global, which tracks funds domiciled globally with $13
trillion in total assets, said on Monday emerging market equity
and bond funds attracted sizeable inflows during the week ending
Aug. 4 as disappointing U.S. data hinted at a weaker dollar.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index lost 0.7
percent, led lower by basic resources stocks <.SXPP> following
the Chinese import data.
 U.S. stock index futures    fell 0.5 to
0.6 percent, indicating softer opening for Wall Street.
 Copper  fell 2.5 percent and oil prices  were
down 1.3 percent to trade below $81 a barrel, on concerns of
less crude purchases by China, the world's second largest energy
consumer.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries  fell
1 basis point to 2.8180 percent, while those on 10-year German
Bunds  were up 2 basis points at 2.547 percent.
 Societe Generale said it was bullish on U.S. Treasuries on
the possibly of more quantitative easing.
 ""Scaring the market with an early move is a clear drawback,
but acting late to fight the deflation risk would be even more
costly,"" it said in a note.
 ""All in all, Treasuries might pull back a touch if the Fed
fails to deliver today, but this will prove to be a buying
opportunity: the QE debate will come back soon anyway unless the
economy or the inflation data quickly turn around.""

 LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against major
currencies on Tuesday as traders trimmed short positions,
awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting amid
speculation of further easing to shore up a flagging U.S.
economy.
 Many market players expect the Fed to take some minor steps
such as reinvesting funds to maintain its balance sheet, but not
going back to full-fledged quantitative easing.
 Investors also pared back on perceived riskier currencies
after seeing a fall in Asian stocks.
 ""We're seeing some squaring up of short positions ahead of
the Fed, and there is some risk-off sentiment as well as Asian
stocks closed lower, prompting a selloff in high yielders such
as the Australian dollar,"" said Christian Lawrence, currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 By 0720 GMT, the euro fell 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade
on Monday to $1.3180, pulling away from a three-month peak of
$1.3334 hit on Friday on trading platform EBS.
 The euro's decline accelerated after falling below trendline
support on hourly charts near $1.3200, with stop-loss orders
also adding to the euro's drop.
 The pair was back to around levels seen before Friday's U.S.
jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls fell 131,000 in
July, while private employment rose a modest 71,000, below
forecasts for a gain of 90,000.
 Shares in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.2 percent and
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2.9 percent.
 Steps by the Fed range from a pledge to consider more
quantitative easing, reinvesting money from maturing debt into
Treasuries or mortgage-based securities, cutting interest paid
on excess reserves, and buying financial assets outright. The
Fed's decision is due out around 1815 GMT.
 ""If the Fed does take action today and U.S. interest rates
fall, that is likely to lead to dollar selling,"" said Hiroshi
Maeba, manager of forex at Nomura Securities.
 
 REPATRIATION
 The yen was the exception to the dollar's broad rebound on
Tuesday as it edged up slightly against the greenback. Traders
cited talk of fund repatriation by Japanese investors related to
coupon payments of U.S. Treasuries due in mid-August.
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.1 percent
and held off on new policy steps, as expected.
 BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank's board
spent much time debating the recent rise in the yen and how it
could affect business sentiment, but he said no major central
bank targets currency levels.
 The dollar was flat at 85.85 yen, some distance from last
Friday's eight-month low of 85.02 yen.
 Market players said there were substantial stop-loss orders
just under options barriers at 85 yen, with more stops sitting
below 84.82 yen. A fall below 84.82 yen would take the dollar to
a 15-year low against the yen.
 Traders think the yen will eventually test these levels as
Japan is seen unlikely to intervene to curb the yen unless
dollar/yen falls to around 80 yen.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to comment
on intervention. He repeated recent market moves are somewhat
one-sided.
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars were also hurt as
sluggish Chinese import figures fanned concerns of slowing
domestic demand.

 By Langi Chiang and Alan Wheatley
 BEIJING, Aug 10 (Reuters) - China's trade surplus surged
unexpectedly in July to an 18-month high of $28.7 billion as
exports beat forecasts, but a government-induced slowdown in
investment took a toll on imports.
 Beijing is steering its super-loose monetary and fiscal
policies back to normal after a record surge in credit last
year to combat the global crisis. It has reined in lending to
local authorities and mounted a drive against property
speculation.
 Annual import growth moderated to 22.7 percent from 34.1
percent in June, well below forecasts of a 30 percent rise,
providing clear evidence that the measures are biting.
 ""We have carried out a proactive adjustment of economic
growth. With economic growth slowing down, import growth is
also easing,"" Huang Guohua, an official at the General
Administration of Customs, which released the data, told state
television.

 Story on July property data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The disappointing figures, which partly reflected a 4.5
percent fall in import prices in July, sent the main Shanghai
stock index tumbling 2.3 percent and weighed on shares in Hong
Kong, underlining investors' fears that the global economic
recovery is losing momentum.
 ""We expect import growth to slow further for the rest of
the year as the domestic economy is coming off the boil,"" said
Nie Wen, an analyst at Fortune Trust Co in Shanghai.
 Exports, by contrast, held up well in July, rising 38.1
percent from a year earlier to a record high of $145.5 billion.
 Growth was down from June's 43.9 percent pace but exceeded
projections of a 35.5 percent rise, partly because exporters
rushed to beat the July 15 removal of tax rebates on an array
of steel and other products.
 The resulting trade surplus of $28.7 billion, the highest
since January 2009, dwarfed forecasts of $19.0 billion as well
as June's $20.0 billion total.
 Brian Jackson, a strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong
Kong, noted that figures due out later this week were likely to
show a U.S. trade deficit of more than $40 billion.
 ""This contrast in the trade position of the two most
important economies in the world will likely increase the
pressure from Washington for Beijing to allow further currency
appreciation, particularly in the lead-up to mid-term elections
in November,"" he said in a note to clients.
 The yuan has risen just 0.8 percent against the dollar
since Beijing scrapped a 23-month peg to the U.S. currency on
June 19 and reinstated a managed float.
 MIXED SIGNALS
 The trade outlook for the rest of the year is cloudy.
 Yu Song and Helen Qiao, economists at Goldman Sachs,
detected signs that Chinese policy had started to loosen, which
they said should lend more support to domestic demand and
import growth.
 But most analysts do not expect the government to relax yet
a series of curbs imposed on the property market in April.
 Fearing that prices were feeding on themselves and putting
the cost of a flat beyond the reach of ordinary people, Beijing
increased down-payments and mortgage rates, made it tougher to
buy multiple homes and tightened financing for developers.
 Figures on Tuesday showed the restrictions appeared to be
working, albeit slowly.
 House prices in 70 cities across China rose 10.3 percent in
the year to July, down from 11.4 percent in the 12 months to
June and a peak in April of 12.8 percent, the National Bureau
of Statistics said.
 But prices on the month were unchanged in July, following a
0.1 percent drop in June.
 Jinsong Du, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong, saw
no need for fresh curbs but said prices in major cities still
had scope to fall another 20 percent by the end of the year.
 ""The government should be pleased that prices are not
rising on a monthly basis,"" Du said. ""In the near term, they
will continue to strictly implement the measures they've
already announced.""
 As for exports, China's strong performance mirrored
resilience in July figures released by South Korea and Taiwan,
indicating that global demand remains strong for now despite
worries about the eurozone's debt mess.
 But with the outlook for the United States darkening, some
economists expect year-on-year export growth to start to fade,
especially as the 2009 base of comparison becomes more
demanding.
 Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist with Royal Bank of Scotland
in Hong Kong, said annual growth could slow to 10 percent by
December.
 At the same time, historical patterns suggest the trade
surplus will grow in the second half of the year, possibly
reaching $30 billion by December, Simpfendorfer said.
 Such a combination could militate against the exchange-rate
shifts needed to produce better-balanced trade.
 ""The two developments will only add to Washington's
insistence on a stronger yuan and Beijing's resistance,"" he
said in a note.

 * Sharp zloty appreciation could pose threat
 * Belka would like to see smaller deficit in 2011
(Adds quotes, detail)
 WARSAW, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The level of the Polish zloty is
satisfactory and if anything threatens the Polish unit, it is
sharp appreciation rather than depreciation, the central bank's
governor Marek Belka said on Tuesday.
 Belka added that he would have hoped to see a smaller
budget deficit next year, but underlined that Poland did not
need very deep fiscal cuts.
 ""If something threatens the zloty, it is its sharp
appreciation rather than depreciation,"" Belka told daily Puls
Biznesu in an interview.
 ""I hope (the zloty) appreciation trend won't be too strong.
The current zloty level is satisfactory.""
 The governor also repeated Poland's central bank may
intervene in the foreign currency market if such a need
emerges.
 The zloty has swung back and forth in recent months. The
central bank interevened to counter its rising strength in
April, while there were reports in May that the finance
ministry had sold euros on the market to stop its sharp fall.
 It hovered around its 3-month highs early on Tuesday, and
was traded at 3.98, a touch below a key level of 4.0 against
the euro.
 BUDGET
 The governor also said he expected the government to curb
next year's budget deficit more ambitiously.
 ""Today it is only a fall to 45 billion zlotys from 52
billion zlotys (envisaged this year),"" Belka said. ""I expected
next year's deficit to be smaller.""
 Under the government's new financial plan, budget deficit
is set to be trimmed gradually to 45 billion zlotys next year
and to 40 billion zlotys in 2012. The key goal of the plan is
to cut the general budget deficit, that includes shortfalls
generated by local government's and agencies, to the EU ceiling
of 3 percent in 2013.
 The plan envisages a temporary increase in value-added tax
(VAT) by 1 percentage points from 2011 and the governor said
last week such a move is tolerable.
 However, he said now he expected the government to cut
spending as other countries consolidate their public finances
nowadays.
 ""However, it doesn't have to be sharp or sudden cuts,""
Belka said.

 * Market deeply divided on whether Fed will ease
 * BOJ stands pat on monetary policy as expected
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar staged a rebound
against major currencies on Tuesday as traders pared short
positions on looming uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal
Reserve will start a new phase of quantitative easing to deal
with a slowing economy.
 Much uncertainty surrounds the Federal Reserve's policy
meeting on Tuesday with the market deeply divided over what the
Fed might do, beyond a rough agreement that it will sound more
cautious on the recovery.
 ""I have a feeling that the market has got carried away with
the idea of the Fed easing. It seems as if most traders are
expecting the Fed to say it will reinvest maturing bonds at
least,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 A Ried Thunberg/ICAP poll of money managers found that 52
percent thought the Fed would take no new action on policy,
while 48 percent believed it would at least hint at new steps.
 Such steps may include anything from a promise to consider
more quantitative easing; to reinvesting money from maturing
debt into Treasuries or MBS; to cutting interest paid on excess
reserves; to buying financial assets outright.
 ""If the Fed does take action today and U.S. interest rates
fall, that is likely to lead to dollar-selling,"" said Hiroshi
Maeba, manager of forex at Nomura Securities.
 The crucial policy announcement from the Fed is expected
around 1815 GMT.
 Given the uncertainty, speculators trimmed their short
dollar positions. The euro fell 0.5 percent from late U.S.
trading on Monday to $1.3148, pulling away from a three-month
peak of $1.3334 hit on Friday on trading platform EBS.
 The euro's decline gained steam after it fell below
trendline support on hourly charts near $1.3200, with stop-loss
orders also adding to the euro's drop.
 The pullback came despite upbeat euro zone data, with
investor morale surging and German exports up
strongly.
 The yen was the exception to the dollar's broad rebound on
Tuesday and edged up slightly against the greenback. Traders
cited talk of fund repatriation by Japanese investors related to
coupon payments of U.S. Treasuries due in mid-August.
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady at 0.1 percent
and held off on new policy steps, in a decision that was in line
with market expectations.
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 85.83 yen, still some
distance from last Friday's eight-month low of 85.02 yen.
 Market players said there are substantial stop-loss orders
just under options barriers at 85 yen, with more stops sitting
below 84.82 yen. A fall below 84.82 yen would take the dollar to
a 15-year low against the yen.
 Traders think the yen will eventually test these levels as
Japan is seen unlikely to intervene to curb the yen unless
dollar/yen falls to around 80 yen.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to comment
on intervention. He also said the recent market moves are
somewhat onesided, but that produced no market response.
 Sterling fell 0.6 percent to $1.5809 after data showed
British house prices fell in the three months to July for the
first time in a year and that retail sales growth slowed sharply
in July.

 By Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan on Tuesday held
off on new policy steps to combat a stronger yen, saving its
limited firepower in case the currency's rise accelerates and
threatens the fragile economic recovery.
 The finance minister cautioned that excessive currency
moves were not good for the economy but did not escalate the
level of his recent warnings, while the economics minister said
the yen's rise may not continue for a long time.
 Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will hold a news conference
later on Tuesday, with his comments embargoed until sometime
after 4:15 p.m. (0715 GMT).
 Policymakers in Tokyo fear that a strong yen could derail
the feeble recovery from the global crisis. Similarly pressures
are mounting on U.S. officials as evidence mounts that growth
in the world's biggest economy is faltering.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and may send a
clear signal it is prepared to print more money to support a
faltering economic recovery.
 While any steps by the Fed might initially be symbolic,
they will still be more forceful than the minor steps preferred
by the BOJ and so may drive down the dollar/yen rate, some
analysts say.
 ""If the yen firms sharply following the Fed policy
announcement later today and the risk of the yen rising towards
80 yen increases, then there is a possibility of the BOJ
holding an emergency meeting,"" said Naoki Iizuka, senior
economist at Mizuho Securities.
 ""In that case, the BOJ might increase the amount or extend
the duration of its market operations. But even if the BOJ
implements such steps, it's questionable how much impact it
would have on the currency market.""
 The dollar is trading within reach of its lowest yen level
in 15 years, after Friday's weak U.S. payrolls data heightened
expectations the Fed will contemplate further steps to support
the economy. It was holding near 85.75 yen on Tuesday.
 As widely expected, the BOJ kept interest rates at 0.1
percent in a unanimous vote.
 It also kept its economic assessment unchanged and said
that the central bank needed to watch how fiscal problems in
some European countries could affect the Japanese and global
economies.
 Both the bond and currency markets showed limited reaction
to the BOJ announcement.
 GROWING ALARM
 Signs of U.S. economic weakness have pushed the dollar down
against the yen, clouding the outlook for Japanese growth and
pressuring the BOJ to loosen its already very easy monetary
policy.
 Japan's government maintained its view on Tuesday that the
economy is steadily picking up, but a government official
warned that recent gains in the yen have been sudden and are
undesirable for growth.
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to comment on
currency levels or intervention in the foreign exchange
markets.
 ""Disorderly and excessive currency moves pose a negative
impact on the economy and financial stability. I hope to watch
markets with utmost caution,"" he said after a cabinet meeting.
 Economics Minister Satoshi Arai told reporters he did not
expect the yen to remain on an uptrend for a long time.
 The Democratic Party-led government has not piled much
pressure on the BOJ for now as the ruling party, weak after
losing its parliamentary majority in upper house elections in
July, is preoccupied with seeking ways to gain support from
other parties in passing legislation.
 But that may change in the autumn, when parliament convenes
for full-fledged debate on the state budget and the Democrats
decide whether to give incumbent Naoto Kan another term in a
party leadership vote in September, some analysts say.
 Analysts say a yen rise and government pressure were
largely behind the BOJ's decision to ease policy in December
last year by setting up a facility offering cheap funds to
banks.
 While the yen has been on an uptrend again, the pace has
been slower than late last year, when it gained 2 yen in a
single day, allowing the BOJ to justify standing pat this time.
 Analysts expect the BOJ to hold off on easing policy unless
the yen appears headed for a record high of 79.75 per dollar at
a pace matching last November's.
 Even if it does act, the BOJ will probably settle for a
minor tweak of policy, rather than a radical change such as a
return to full-blown quantitative easing. The effect on the yen
and the economy would therefore be limited, analysts say.
 The BOJ has kept interest rates at 0.1 percent since late
2008. It eased monetary policy last December with the
fund-supply tool, which was expanded in March.
 The Fed decision is expected around 1815 GMT.

 By Nopporn Wong-Anan
 SINGAPORE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Singapore faces the risks of
an annualised contraction in its economy in the second half of
2010 due to a global slowdown but remains on course to be one
of the world's fastest growing countries.
 The government kept its annual growth forecast for 2010 at
13 percent to 15 percent -- its strongest yearly expansion --
as demand for electronics and a surging flow of tourists will
offset a fall in biomedical production due to plant maintenance
shutdowns and a possible shift in output mix.
 ""It is possible that we could have two quarters of negative
sequential growth, which would qualify as a technical
recession,"" Ravi Menon, permanent secretary of the Ministry of
Trade and Industry, told reporters on Tuesday.
 Singapore last went into recession -- defined as two
straight quarters of contraction -- in 2008 when the economy
shrank from the second to the last quarter.
 ""We see this moderation in growth as a healthy
normalisation of economic activities,"" said DBS economist Irvin
Seah. ""And even with the growth momentum slowing down, the
Singapore economy is still on track to meet our target of 15
percent growth.""
 Gross domestic product in the April to June period soared
24 percent on an annualised basis, a downward revision from a
26 percent expansion estimated in July.
 BEARABLE INFLATION
 The economy also grew 18.8 percent in the same quarter from
a year earlier, versus a 19.3 percent rise reported last month.
 Despite rising prices of food, fuel and vehicles, which
could push inflation to 4 percent by the end of the year, the
central bank said on Tuesday the average 2010 inflation rate
would stay at ""tolerable levels"" of between 2.5 percent to 3.3
percent.
 That means the monetary policy stance of allowing a modest
and gradual appreciation in the Singapore dollar remains
appropriate, said Ong Chong Tee, deputy managing director of
the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
 Ong said the Singapore dollar's rise this year is in line
with gains in other Asian currencies against the dollar. The
Singapore dollar is up 4 percent against the U.S. dollar so far
in 2010.
 The central bank said it was not worried over capital flows
to Singapore, viewing it as part of fund flows that reflected
strong Asian economies.
 Ong also said banks regularly stress-tested scenarios such
as interest rate movements and exposures to stocks and
property. He said Singapore banks' exposure to the property
industry was well within the limit of 35 percent of their
assets.
 Regulators worldwide are increasingly wary about the
exposure of banks to property.
 China's banking regulator recently ordered banks to conduct
a stress test assuming a fall in house prices of up to 60
percent, just as policies to cool the sizzling market start to
bite.

 BEIJING, Aug 10 (Reuters) - China's trade surplus
unexpectedly ballooned in July to an 18-month high, handing fresh
ammunition to critics who say Beijing is not moving swiftly
enough to let the yuan rise.
 Exports showed resilience, rising 38.1 percent from a year
earlier to a record high of $145.5 billion. Shipments to the
United States and the European Union rose from June levels,
defying worries about slowing demand.
 But imports posted a surprising decline in apparent response
to a government drive to rein in property speculation and root
out obsolete manufacturing capacity.
 Annual import growth slowed to 22.7 percent from 34.1 percent
in June, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday.
 ""Import growth is weaker than expected, indicating that
China's investment is slowing,"" said Eliza Liu, a macro economist
with CCB International Securities in Beijing.
 As a result, China reported a trade surplus for July of $28.7
billion, the highest since January 2009 and up from $20.0 billion
in June.
 The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters was for
exports to rise 35.5 percent and imports to climb 30.0 percent,
with a projected trade surplus of $19.0 billion. [ID:nTOE67307]
 Brian Jackson, a strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong
Kong, noted that figures due out later this week were likely to
show a U.S. trade deficit of more than $40 billion.
 ""This contrast in the trade position of the two most
important economies in the world will likely increase the
pressure from Washington for Beijing to allow further currency
appreciation, particularly in the lead-up to mid-term elections

 The yuan  has risen just 0.8 percent against the
dollar since Beijing scrapped a 23-month peg to the U.S. currency
on June 19.
 The disappointing import data sent the local stock market
reeling. The main Shanghai index <.SSEC> ended the morning down
1.82 percent.
 ""We expect import growth to slow further for the rest of the
year as the domestic economy is coming off the boil,"" said Nie
Wen, an analyst at Fortune Trust Co in Shanghai.
 But the Australian dollar, which is sensitive to Chinese
growth prospects, fell only marginally against the dollar.
 Yu Song and Helen Qiao, economists at Goldman Sachs, said the
trade surplus was certainly a reflection of weak import growth.
 ""However, this pattern may start to change in the coming
months as domestic policy has started to loosen, which should
lend more support to domestic demand and imports growth,"" they
said in a note to clients.

 * Dollar up on short-covering as Fed decision looms
 * Market deeply divided on whether Fed will ease
 * Bank of Japan meeting, China trade also on menu
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, aug 10 (Reuters) - The dollar staged a rebound against
major currencies on Tuesday as traders pared short positions on
looming uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will
start a new phase of quantitative easing to deal with a slowing
economy.
 Much uncertainty surrounds the Federal Reserve's policy
meeting on Tuesday with the market deeply divided over what the
Fed might do, beyond a rough agreement that it will sound more
cautious on the recovery.
 ""I have a feeling that the market has got carried away with
the idea of the Fed easing. It seems as if most traders are
expecting the Fed to say it will reinvest maturing bonds at
least,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 A Ried Thunberg/ICAP poll of money managers found that 52
percent thought the Fed would take no new action on policy, while
48 percent believed they would at least hint at new steps.
 Such steps may include anything from a promise to consider
more quantitative easing; to reinvesting money from maturing
debt into Treasuries or MBS; to cutting interest paid on excess
reserves; to buying financial assets outright.
 ""If the Fed does take action today and U.S. interest rates
fall, that is likely to lead to dollar-selling,"" said Hiroshi
Maeba, manager of forex at Nomura Securities.
 The crucial policy announcement from the Fed is expected
around 1815 GMT.
 Given the uncertainty, speculators chose to trim their short
U.S. dollar positions, pulling the euro back to $1.3186, down
0.25 percent from $1.3225 in New York and a three-month peak of
$1.3334 on Friday.
 Its decline mounted after stop-loss orders hit at $1.32.
 The pullback came despite upbeat euro zone data, with
investor morale surging and German exports up
strongly.
 German exports have benefited greatly from resilient demand
in Asia, which should be echoed by July trade data from China
on Tuesday. China's exports are seen up 35.5 percent on the
year, with imports rising 30 percent.
 The yen was the exception to the dollar's broad rebound on
Tuesday, edging up slightly, due to repatriation by Japanese
investors due to the redemption of U.S. bonds.
 The Bank of Japan will also conclude its two-day policy
meeting on Tuesday, although most market players do not expect
the Japanese central bank to take action this time.
 But some traders think a lack of action from the BOJ could
push the yen higher, especially if the Fed does embark on new
steps.
 The dollar slipped to around 85.80 yen, down 0.1 percent,
though it sill some distance from last Friday's eight-month low
of 85.02 yen.
 Still, there were substantial stop-loss orders just under
option barriers at 85 yen, potentially triggering a further slide,
traders said.
 More stops were sitting below 84.82 yen, with
option barriers at 84.75 yen seen rolling off later in the
week.
 Traders think the yen will eventually test these levels as
Japan is unlikely to intervene to curb the yen unless dollar/yen
falls to around 80 yen.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda declined to comment
on intervention. He also said the recent market moves are
somewhat onesided, but that produced no market response.
 The pound slipped 0.5 percent to $1.5824 after data showed
British house prices fell last month and retail sales growth
slowed abruptly.
 The Australian dollar also dropped 0.4 percent to $0.9126
after National Australian Bank's monthly business condition
survey showed business confidence dropped to its lowest in 14
months.

 HONG KONG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rebounded
against the euro and Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday as
investors braced for the outcome of a Federal Reserve meeting
that could disappoint some looking for big policy changes.
 There was no uniform outlook for trade in European shares
after the previous session's gains and as Asian bourses
retreated on China's disappointing import numbers.
 ""The risks are now increasingly being weighted on the
downside,"" noted Cameron Peacock, an analyst at IG Markets.
 ""Any perceived failure from the Fed to be taking positive
action over the economy could quite easily be the trigger to
another bout of selling across the globe.""
 Shares in Hong Kong <.HSI> and Shanghai <.SSEC> fell after
data showed China's July import growth was below market
expectations, pointing to slowing domestic demand and economic
activity. [ID:nTOE67903G]
 The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady, as expected,
and held off on any new policy steps, which market players said
had little market impact. [ID:nTOE67900S]
 ""Shanghai shares fell quite a lot, as did the rest of Asia,
and this dragged the Nikkei lower. U.S. stock futures have
turned negative as well,"" said Hiroaki Osakabe, a fund manager
at Chibagin Asset Management.
 Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>
to open 8 to 14 points lower, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> to open
between 3 points higher and 18 points lower, and France's
CAC-40 <.FCHI> to open 10 points either side of the previous
close.
 Speculation has been growing that the Fed will signal a
need for more stimulus to support growth after a steady stream
of soft economic figures, pushing down U.S. bond yields and
helping to lift global equities to the highest in three months.
 However, acknowledgment of economic deceleration may
disappoint some investors who had been betting the Fed would
make a bigger move, such as buying bonds to pull down market
rates.
 ""I have a feeling that the market has got carried away with
the idea of the Fed easing. It seems as if most traders are
expecting the Fed to say it will reinvest maturing bonds at
least,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against a trade-weighted basket
of currencies <.DXY>, bumping up against a trendline stretching
downwards since June.
 The euro fell to $1.3160 from $1.3223 on Monday as
investors cut short-dollar positions ahead of the Fed meeting.
[ID:nTOE67904V]
 STOCKS REFLECT CAUTION AHEAD OF FED
 Japanese stocks reversed earlier gains to close lower after
the Bank of Japan left rates unchanged, with the Nikkei share
average <.N225> down 0.2 percent as investors bought back
counters they had sold on Monday.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan fell
1.2 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS> to its lowest in four trading
sessions after hitting a three-month high on Monday.
 Developed government bond markets were mixed, with 10-year
bond futures in Japan and Australia down slightly and U.S.
futures steady.
 The spread of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield over the
2-year note in the cash market hit its narrowest since May
2009, with investors clinging to the higher yields of later
maturity bonds.
 Bond market participants are split on what the Fed will do.
Fifty-two percent of money managers do not expect the Fed to
flag additional policy easing, while 48 percent predict it
will, a Reid Thunberg ICAP survey showed.
 If the Fed does not strike a strong enough tone supporting
growth, thereby getting closer to buying bonds from the market,
the spread could widen again.
 The strength in the dollar weighed on U.S. crude prices.
Oil for September delivery reversed earlier gains and fell 0.7
percent to $80.94 a barrel ahead of data due later expected to
show a decline in U.S. crude inventories.
 Gold was largely unchanged on the day, trading just below
$1,200 an ounce , ahead of the Fed's meeting. The
precious metal is still heading for its 10th straight year of
gains.

 * Govt keen to avoid repeat of 2007 mass walkout
 
 By Ed Cropley
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - South Africa is braced for
a major public sector workers strike on Tuesday, with unions
representing more than a million civil servants backing a
one-day walkout to demand higher pay.
 Marches are planned for Cape Town and Pretoria, South
Africa's administrative capital, as part of a ""total shut-down
of the public service"", according to powerful labour
confederation COSATU.
 Everything from schools to public offices to immigration
centres are expected to be affected, although essential services
such as police and hospitals are likely to run on a skeleton
staff.
 COSATU and its member unions have threatened to drag the
industrial action beyond Tuesday if government does not meet its
demands of an 8.6 percent pay hike -- twice the current rate of
inflation -- and a 1,000 rand ($139) monthly housing stipend.
 The government is offering 7 percent and 630 rand for
housing, although analysts believe it is likely to raise its
offer rather than risk a repeat of a prolonged 2007 civil
service walk-out that hit the economy.
 ""There is a very strong possibility that by the end of the
week, we will be embarking on a larger strike,"" said Sizwe
Pamla, spokesman for NEHAWU, one of the COSATU unions.
 The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has a
long-standing alliance with unions forged in the struggle
against apartheid and has tended to acquiesce to worker demands
to maintain relations with its governing partner.
 However, the latest union wage bids, which the government
says combine to a 9 percent increase, are likely to put pressure
on the budget and make it very hard to bring the deficit down
from 6.7 percent of GDP without spending cutbacks elsewhere.
 Spending on personnel is the largest sector of the budget.
 The central bank has also expressed concern about elevated
pay increases stoking inflation in the wider economy, putting
upward pressure on interest rates.

 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose and the
dollar edged higher on Monday on growing expectations the
U.S.Federal Reserve will signal this week it is ready to renew
its stimulus efforts to prop up a weakening U.S. economy.
 Disappointing U.S. jobs data on Friday fanned speculation
the Fed may soon buy U.S. debt to support an economy that is
showing signs of slipping back into recession and to fight
potential deflation.
 The dollar rose against major currencies as investors
squared up positions before the Fed's policy-setting committee
meets on Tuesday. [ID:nN09270930]
 Trading was limited as investors refrained from chasing
prices aggressively, with many already pricing in some form of
modest easing. Total U.S. stock volume was 5.76 billion
shares, the quietest session so far this year.
 ""We're expecting the Fed to officially lay the groundwork
for a policy change predicated on another month of economic
data,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential
Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
 ""If they actually come out and say they're going to start
a new plan tomorrow, it might actually spook the market into
believing that things are much worse than we thought.""
 The U.S. central bank may resume the purchase of debt in a
bid to lower rates and encourage borrowing. It could also halt
interest payments on banks' excess reserves to spur lending.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> and its
emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> both rose about 5 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 45.19
points, or 0.42 percent, to close at 10,698.75. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> advanced 6.15 points, or 0.55 percent,
to finish at 1,127.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose
17.22 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 2,305.69.
 The Dow was weighed down by Hewlett-Packard Co ,
whose shares fell 8 percent to $42.60. The company said on
Friday its chief executive quit after an investigation found
he falsified expense reports to conceal a ""close personal
relationship"" with a female contractor.
 ALL EYES AND EARS ON THE FED
 ""Today's trade is all about anticipation of tomorrow. The
main question is, 'Will the Fed throw another quantitative
easing bombshell?' And according to that, people are either
buying or waiting on the sidelines,"" said John Canally, an
economist at LPL Financial in Boston.
 Against a basket of major currencies as measured by the
U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>, the dollar rose 0.39 percent to
80.720.
 The euro  was down 0.36 percent at $1.3234, and
against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.42
percent at 85.85.
 Stocks also rose in Europe and Asia as investors bought
riskier assets on expectations the Fed may inject extra
stimulus to maintain a recovery, helping lift sentiment.

 U.S. government debt prices slipped as investors cleared
space for this week's $74 billion longer-dated supply and

double-dip recession. [ID:nN09274977]
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 2/32 in price to yield 2.83 percent.
 Oil rose for the first time in four sessions, edging back
above $81 a barrel on Fed expectations.
 U.S. crude for September  delivery rose 78 cents, or
0.97 percent, to settle at $81.48 a barrel. Front-month ICE
Brent crude  rose 83 cents to settle at $80.99 a
barrel.
 Gold futures ended lower, snapping an eight-session
winning streak, as a stronger dollar prompted investors to
lock in profits ahead of a closely watched policy statement by
the U.S. Federal Reserve. [ID:nLDE6780QH]
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery dropped $2.70 to
settle at $1,202.60, the contract's first decline since July
27.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan equities rose 0.8
percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS> to its highest since May 4. Japan's
Nikkei share average <.N225> fell 0.7 percent, however, due to
the negative impact of a stronger yen on exporters.

 By Jennifer Kwan
 TORONTO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was a touch
higher against its U.S. counterpart on Monday, supported by
firm equity and oil prices, but was seen remaining in a tight
range as investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision
and commentary on interest rates on Tuesday.
 The U.S. central bank, while widely expected to renew its
vow to keep interest rates near zero for an extended period,
may indicate it is prepared to print more money to support the
economy. [ID:nN09301078]
 ""Flow is thin as one would expect on a summertime day ahead
of a Fed meeting tomorrow. There is anticipation in terms of
quantitative easing or the suggestion that perhaps it is likely
to reintroduce it,"" said Jack Spitz, managing director of
foreign exchange at National Bank Financial.
 ""The debate is with respect to quantitative easing and
whether the Fed makes reference to it in the communique ...
It's really all about guidance.""
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0267 to the
U.S. dollar, or 97.40 U.S. cents, up slightly from Friday's
close of C$1.0279 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.29 U.S. cents.
 The currency got a boost from firmness in North American
equity markets, which rose on speculation the Fed may move to
stimulate the sluggish U.S. economy, and on strength in the
price of oil, a key Canadian export, which climbed above $81 a
barrel. [.TO] [.N] [O/R]
 ""The market is still looking to see no change,"" said Jon
Gencher, director of foreign exchange sales at BMO Capital
Markets, referring to U.S. interest rates.
 ""Anything the market is going to be looking for is
basically what they have to say with regard to the outlook.""
 Spitz said the market was watching for technical levels at
C$1.0145. As well, key levels will be the 90-day moving average
of C$1.0322 to the U.S. dollar, and the 200-day moving average
of C$1.04 to the U.S. dollar.
 BONDS FLAT
 With no major data on Monday to offer direction, Canadian
bond prices were largely flat, said Kam Bath, fixed income
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 Analysts also said bonds were slightly softer on unwinding
after a big rally on Friday when doubts about the economic
recovery prompted investors to embrace the safety of government
debt. [US/]
 ""There's just not much direction today. We had a bit of a
move on Friday so maybe it's exhaustion,"" said Bath.
 The two-year bond  drooped 1 Canadian cent to
yield 1.445 percent, while the 10-year bond  was
unchanged to yield 3.075 percent.
 Canadian bonds mostly outperformed U.S. Treasury issues
across the curve. The Canadian 2-year bond  was 90
basis points above the U.S. 2-year yield, compared with about
93 basis points above on Friday.

 By Steven C. Johnson and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against major
currencies on Monday as investors squared up positions a day
ahead of this week's Federal Reserve monetary policy
announcement.
 Gains were limited by Friday's disappointing U.S. jobs
data, which showed the economy continues to struggle. Analysts
said markets are pricing in at least some form of modest easing
when the Fed meets on Tuesday.
 ""Investors are likely to consolidate positions ahead of
tomorrow afternoon's policy meeting,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""While some risk of new policy action is already priced
into the greenback's valuation, more stimulus would make a
dollar recovery difficult in the near-term."" For a preview of
Fed meeting, see [ID:nN06209685]
 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3224 , off a
three-month peak of $1.3334 on Friday.
 The euro added to losses after it failed to hold above the
$1.33 level, which triggered automatic sell orders at $1.3250
and $1.3240, traders said.
 Traders also kept a close eye on the yen, which rose to
85.02 yen versus the dollar on EBS on Friday, just shy of a
15-year peak of 84.82 yen hit last November. It was last up 0.4
percent at 85.87 yen .
 There were substantial automatic ""stop loss"" trades that
would be triggered just under option barriers at 85 yen,
potentially triggering a further slide, traders said. More
stops were sitting below 84.82 yen, with option barriers at
84.75 yen seen rolling off later in the week, they said.
 Markets fear Japanese authorities could intervene to weaken
the yen so its strength does not derail a fragile, export-led
recovery. Japan's finance minister expressed concern about yen
strength on Monday. [ID:nTOE67800S]
 The dollar also rose against the Swiss franc, up 0.9
percent to 1.0485 francs  while sterling fell 0.3 percent
to $1.5903 .
 SHORT DOLLAR POSITIONS
 Data showed currency speculators increased bets against the
U.S. dollar in the latest week and increased their net yen long
positions to the highest level since December.

 The anti-dollar bias in markets could keep the euro fairly
buoyant in the near term, though profit-taking is expected as
the euro approaches $1.35, analysts said.
 That level almost coincides with a 50 percent retracement
of the single currency's fall from a November peak of $1.5145
to a four-year trough of $1.1876 hit in June.
 Fed officials could add to a negative dollar tone on
Tuesday if they ""talk tough and make further hints about how
they could intervene,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 Markets have speculated that the Fed could revive a plan to
buy Treasury and mortgage debt to give the economy a boost,
though Wilkinson said he thinks officials will hold off on
taking action for now.
 Data on Friday showed that overall U.S. payrolls fell by
131,000 in July. Private employment, a better gauge of labor
market health, rose a modest 71,000, below forecasts for a gain
of 90,000. [ID:nN05598486]

into the greenback's valuation, more stimulus would make a

 The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.3226 , off a
three-month peak of $1.3334 on Friday.
 The euro added to losses after it failed to hold above the
$1.33 level, which triggered automatic sell orders at $1.3250
and $1.3240, traders said.
 Traders also kept a close eye on the yen, which rose to
85.02 yen versus the dollar on EBS on Friday, just shy of a
15-year peak of 84.82 yen hit last November. It was last up 0.4
percent at 85.84 yen .
 There were substantial automatic ""stop loss"" trades that
would be triggered just under option barriers at 85 yen,
potentially triggering a further slide, traders said. More
stops were sitting below 84.82 yen, with option barriers at
84.75 yen seen rolling off later in the week, they said.
 Markets fear Japanese authorities could intervene to weaken
the yen so that strength does not derail a fragile, export-led
recovery. Japan's finance minister expressed concern about yen
strength on Monday. [ID:nTOE67800S]

U.S. dollar in the latest week and increased their net yen long
positions to the highest level since December.

 The anti-dollar bias in markets could keep the euro fairly
buoyant in the near term, though profit-taking is expected as
the euro approaches $1.35, analysts said.
 That level almost coincides with a 50 percent retracement
of the single European currency's fall from a November peak of
$1.5145 to a four-year trough of $1.1876 hit in June.
 It's possible Fed officials will add to a negative dollar
bias on Tuesday if they ""talk tough and make further hints
about how they could intervene,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior
analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich,
Connecticut.
 Markets have speculated that the Fed could revive a plan to
buy Treasury and mortgage debt to give the economy a boost,
though Wilkinson said he thinks officials will hold off on
taking action for now.

 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose and the
dollar edged higher on Monday on growing expectations the U.S.
Federal Reserve will signal this week it is prepared to renew
its stimulus efforts to prop up an anemic U.S. economy.
 Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data in July, released last
Friday, fanned speculation the Fed may soon buy U.S. debt to
support an economy that is showing signs of falling back into
recession and to fight potential deflation.
 The dollar edged higher against major currencies as
investors were reluctant to place big bets ahead of the Fed's
policy-setting meeting on Tuesday. For details see:

 Volume was limited as traders and investors refrained from
chasing prices aggressively, with many already pricing in some
form of modest easing.
 ""The weak non-farm payrolls data before a Fed meeting is
giving further confidence to the bond market's belief that the
Fed will play to its dual mandate of both caretaker of the job
market and advocate for price stability,"" said George
Goncalves, head of U.S. rates strategy at Nomura Securities in
New York.
 U.S. stocks gained, but the Dow was weighed by shares of
Hewlett-Packard Co , off 7.5 percent. The company said
on Friday its chief executive quit after an investigation
found he falsified expense reports to conceal a ""close
personal relationship"" with a female contractor.
 ""Today's trade is all about anticipation of tomorrow. The
main question is, 'Will the Fed throw another quantitative
easing bombshell?' And according to that, people are either
buying or waiting on the sidelines,"" said John Canally, an

 European stocks gained after data showed German exports
should approach record levels next year after beating
forecasts in June, another sign that foreign demand is driving
a stronger-than-expected recovery in Europe's largest

 U.S. Treasuries were having a hard time attracting any
safe-haven buying on Monday, however, with benchmark yields
hovering near 15-month lows.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
unchanged in price to yield 2.82 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 2/32 in price to yield 0.55

(Adds quote, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against
major currencies on Monday, coming off Friday's lows, as wary
investors lightened positions before a Federal Reserve monetary
policy announcement.
 But gains by the dollar were limited after disappointing
U.S. jobs data on Friday added to speculation about further
monetary easing. Major currencies traded in tight ranges as
investors believed the markets have already priced in some form
of modest easing at the Fed Open Market Committee meeting on
Tuesday.
 ""Investors are likely to consolidate positions ahead of
tomorrow afternoon's FOMC policy meeting,"" said Omer Esiner,
chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in
Washington.
 ""While some risk of new policy action is already priced
into the greenback's valuation, more stimulus would make a
dollar recovery difficult in the near-term."".
 In midday trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.3237,
not far from a three-month peak of $1.3334 struck on electronic
trading platform EBS on Friday.
 The euro added to losses after it failed to hold above the
$1.33 level and stops were triggered at $1.3250 and $1.3240,
traders said.
 The dollar's general weakness could keep the euro buoyant
in the near term, but profit-taking is expected to increase as
the euro approaches the psychologically key $1.3500 level,
analysts said.
 That level almost coincides with a 50 percent retracement
of the single European currency's fall from a November peak of
$1.5145 to a four-year trough of $1.1876 hit in June.
 Traders also kept a close eye on the yen, which rose to
85.02 yen versus the dollar on EBS on Friday, just shy of a
15-year peak of 84.82 yen hit last November.
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 85.83 yen.
 There were substantial automatic ""stop loss"" trades that
would be triggered just under option barriers at 85.00 yen,
potentially triggering a slide further, traders said. More
stops were sitting below 84.82 yen, with option barriers at
84.75 yen seen rolling off later in the week, they said.
 SHORT DOLLAR POSITIONS
 Data showed currency speculators increased bets against the
U.S. dollar in the latest week and increased their net yen long
positions to the highest level since December. The dollar
edged up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies to 80.599.
Support was seen at the April low of 80.031 and then the March
trough of 79.507, traders said.
 Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive
Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut, said Fed officials
will probably be more inclined during this stage of moderation
in growth ""to talk tough and make further hints about how they
could intervene"" when they meet on Tuesday.
 ""There is a strong chance that FOMC officials are fretful
over delivering a shot to the foot by announcing new measures
now,"" he said. ""To do so would capitulate along with other
gloomy forecasters expecting the economy to fall off a cliff.""
 Data on Friday showed that overall U.S. non-farm payrolls
fell 131,000 in July, while private employment, a better gauge
of labor market health, rose a modest 71,000, below forecasts
for a gain of 90,000.
 By contrast, data on Monday suggested the euro zone was in
better shape. Euro zone investor morale surged while German
exports rose more than forecast.

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2010 11:24AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Russia rouble hurt by concern over drought impact," * Rouble gives up some recent gains, hits 4-mth low vs euro
 * Bruised by risk aversion, concerns about drought
 * Retains support from strong oil prices
 * Dealers say investors prefer wait-and-see stance
 
 (Adds quotes, details, updates prices)
 MOSCOW, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble trimmed recent
gains on Monday despite strong oil prices, as worries over the
country's persistent heat wave and drought fanned risk aversion
and investor fears about the weather's impact on economic
activity.
 Dealers say Russia's forex market is worried about the
impact of a long heat wave in central Russia that has sparked
forest fires, blanketing Moscow and its suburbs with suffocating
smog and prompting many people to leave Russia's main financial
centre for cooler and less polluted places.
 Although full implications of the drought are as yet
unclear, it reinforces risk aversion, increasing the temptation
to ditch roubles for safer assets, such as dollars or euros.
 ""It's odd to keep long positions in the currency of the
country where ... harvest forecasts are being revised every
day,"" said a dealer at a major Russian bank in Moscow.
 As a result of droughts, Russian authorities imposed a ban
on grain exports while market prices for wheat surged towards a
two-year high.
 In the long run, though, some say the drought could actually
benefit the rouble as long as it does not hurt economic growth
too much. The drought could curb farm production, sparking a
rise in consumer prices which the central bank would probably
cap by reducing its currency interventions and allowing the
rouble to firm further.
 Oil prices -- the rouble's key benchmark -- remained
supportive, holding above $80 per barrel and ensuring inflows
into the export-oriented economy.
 Equity markets were also on firm ground, with Russia's
benchmark RTS and MICEX indexes rising 0.8-1.3 percent,
following European and Asian stock markets.
 However, that was offset by domestic factors and reluctance
to implement investments on summer-thinned market.
""The external background is OK but the internal is pretty
middling. It's sad in Moscow, the market's climate is not good
given all these fumes and smog,"" said a dealer at a major
western bank in Moscow.
 Versus the euro, the rouble closed down 10 kopecks, or 0.25
percent at 39.64 after falling to its lowest since April of
39.71, according to Reuters data.
 Against the dollar, it was down 13 kopecks, or 0.43 percent
at 29.91, heading away from a three-month peak of 29.67 hit last
week. 
 Versus the euro-dollar basket, the rouble was down 12
kopecks, or 0.35 percent at 34.28, remaining in the range of the
central bank's so-called ""target"" interventions.
 In July the central bank bought some $0.5 billion on the
MICEX exchange, absorbing excessive supply of foreign currencies
and thus easing upward pressure on the rouble.
 The rouble is unlikely to fall below 34.40 against the
basket this week as oil prices remain supportive, said Dmitriy
Polevoy, analyst at ING bank in Moscow.
 Dealers say an upside move in the rouble may be seen closer
to the month-end when Russia's exporters will step up converting
dollars and euros to meet domestic monthly taxes.

 KIEV, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine's central bank said on
Monday it cut its key discount rate to 7.75 percent from 8.50
percent effective from August 10, the third cut this year.
 The bank said in a statement the move was designed to
stimulate bank lending and give a boost to the economy
recovering from a 15 percent slump last year.
 Annual inflation slowed to 6.8 percent in July from 6.9
percent in June as consumer prices fell 0.2 percent
month-on-month -- the fourth monthly decline in a row.
 The discount rate serves as a benchmark for a series of
other rates in Ukraine.

 * New Zealand apples banned since 1921
* Ruling could also open other markets

(Adds details, background, quotes, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Australia's decades-old
restrictions on imports of New Zealand apples break
international trade laws and should be amended, the World Trade
Organization said on Monday.
The WTO panel ruling should open the way for New Zealand to
resume sales of apples to its biggest trading partner after
nearly 90 years, and holds out the possibility of access to
other Asian markets where its apples are banned for similar
reasons.
 Like many trade disputes this one turned on health and
safety rules, which are vulnerable to being exploited by
domestic producers to ward off foreign competition.
 The WTO experts did not back Wellington on all its claims,
disagreeing that Australia's sanitary controls were arbitrary.
 But in a 597-page report they found that Australian safety
checks on New Zealand apples were unscientific and disrupted
trade more than necessary, and that New Zealand's rights under
global trade law had been damaged as a result.
 The dispute marks a rare tiff across the Tasman Sea,
involving two neighbours with about $13 billion a year in
two-way trade. Both countries have strict quarantine rules to
protect their agriculture from foreign infections.
 Australia banned New Zealand apples in 1921 because of fears
that fire blight, a disease that attacks apple and pear trees
and rose bushes, could spread. Wellington has tried to have the
ban lifted since 1986, and began a challenge at the WTO in 2007.
 Wellington argued that the ban was not justified on
scientific grounds as fire blight cannot be carried on mature
fruit. Canberra disagreed, so New Zealand then asked Australia
to define what quarantine arrangements would be necessary.
 
 EFFECTIVE BAN
 Rules proposed by Australia in 2007 to cover fire blight and
two other pests were so tough that New Zealand argued they
amounted to a continued ban.
 The ruling will be welcomed by New Zealand producers such as
Turners & Growers.
 New Zealand officials estimate that lifting the Australian
ban could add NZ$30 million ($22 million) within two to three
years to apple exports totalling NZ$400 million in 2009.
 But the ruling could also open other markets, according to
industry lobby Pipfruit New Zealand. ""The implications for us
run a lot deeper in terms of other market access issues that we
currently have,"" said Pipfruit NZ Chairman Ian Palmer.
 New Zealand had particular problems with Japan and South
Korea. ""Korea is one of the expanding markets that we would like
to be in, but they have the same fire blight ban that the
Australians have,"" Palmer told Reuters.
 New Zealand exports 75-80 percent of its annual crop of
about 400,000 tonnes, mainly to Europe and especially Germany
and Britain, as well as to the United States and Asia, notably
Taiwan.
 The ruling could also crack open the Australian fruit market
to imports from other suppliers, such as the United States and
Chile, the world's third biggest apple exporter.
 The two countries now have 60 days in which to appeal.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against
major currencies on Monday, coming off Friday's lows as wary
investors lightened positions ahead of a Federal Reserve
interest rate announcement.
 But the dollar stayed on the defensive, as disappointing
U.S. jobs data on Friday highlighted a weakening U.S. economic
outlook and added to speculation about further monetary
easing.
 Market players refrained from chasing prices aggressively,
having already priced in some form of modest easing at the
Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday. This kept major
currencies within fairly tight ranges.
 ""Investors are likely to consolidate positions ahead of
tomorrow afternoon's FOMC policy meeting,"" said Omer Esiner,
chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in
Washington.
 ""While some risk of new policy action is already priced
into the greenback's valuation, more stimulus would make a
dollar recovery difficult in the near-term.""
 In early New York trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent to
$1.3246, not far from a three-month peak of $1.3334 struck on
electronic trading platform EBS on Friday.
 The euro added to losses after it failed to hold above the
$1.33 level and stops were triggered at $1.3250 and $1.3240,
traders said.
 The dollar's general weakness could keep the euro buoyant
in the near term, but profit-taking is expected to increase as
the euro approaches the psychologically key $1.3500 level.
 That level almost coincides with a 50 percent retracement
of the single European currency's fall from a November peak of
$1.5145 to a four-year trough of $1.1876 hit in June.
 Traders also kept a close eye on the yen, which rose to
85.02 yen versus the dollar on trading platform EBS on Friday,
just shy of a 15-year peak of 84.82 yen hit last November.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 85.68 yen.
 There were substantial automatic ""stop loss"" trades that
would be triggered just under option barriers at 85.00 yen,
potentially triggering a slide further, traders said. More
stops were sitting below 84.82 yen, with option barriers at
84.75 yen seen rolling off later in the week, they said.
 SHORT DOLLAR POSITIONS
 Data showed currency speculators increased bets against the
U.S. dollar in the latest week and increased their net yen long
positions to the highest level since December.
 The dollar edged up 0.3 percent against a basket of
currencies to 80.621. Support was seen at the April low of
80.031 and then the March trough of 79.507, traders said.
 ""It would be a shock were the Fed to go beyond stating that
it will re-invest maturing mortgage-based securities,
preventing its $2.3 trillion balance sheet from shrinking,""
said Tom Levinson, currency strategist at ING.
 ""A downgrading of its economic and inflation assessment may
be considered a potential precursor to renewed action in coming
months should things not start to improve,"" he added.
 Data on Friday showed that overall U.S. non-farm payrolls
fell 131,000 in July, while private employment, a better gauge
of labor market health, rose a modest 71,000, below forecasts
for a gain of 90,000.
 By contrast, data on Monday suggested the euro zone was in
better shape. Euro zone investor morale surged while German
exports rose more than forecast.

 * Santos backs ""fiscal rule"" to limit government spending
 * Bond market wants discipline after free-spending Uribe
 By Hugh Bronstein
 BOGOTA, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street has greeted
Colombia's new President Juan Manuel Santos as a champion of
the markets who promises to improve the country's finances by
reining in the central government's chronically high deficit.
 But investors will watch closely for proof that Santos, who
was sworn in on Saturday [ID:nN07219451], is serious about
clamping down on the structurally high spending that has mired
Colombia's credit rating in junk bond territory for more than a
decade.
 The deficit, estimated at 4.4 percent of gross domestic
product this year, has pumped up borrowing costs and helped
spur Colombia's peso currency  to a two-year high that
has the local export sector howling for relief.
A ""fiscal rule"", proposed by the outgoing administration of
Alvaro Uribe and embraced by Santos, tops the new government's
reform agenda. It would oblige the state to save money and cut
debt during boom-times in order to have the reserves needed to
run countercyclical spending policies when the economy slows.
 The market also embraces Santos' plan to use oil and mining
royalties to build infrastructure projects nationwide and feed
a savings account to be established overseas in order to ease
upward pressures on the peso.
 But some say that Santos, who has a 75 percent popularity
rating, should be bolder in trying to drive long-sought-after
pension and tax reforms through Congress.
 ""I just don't think that Santos is being ambitious enough,""
said Patrick Esteruelas, analyst for Latin America at the
Eurasia Group consultancy in New York. ""Now that he has
unequivocal backing across the board and very strong political
cards to play, this is the time to be ambitious.""

 Santos's main policies [ID:nN02274482]
 Political risks in Colombia [ID:nRISKCO]
 Reuters Insider report http://link.reuters.com/max73n

 The central government fiscal deficit is expected to widen
this year to 4.4 percent of GDP from 4.2 percent in 2009.
Santos' team aims to cut it to 1.5 percent within four years.
 Colombia's economy grew a sturdy 4.4 percent in the first
quarter after a 0.8 percent expansion last year. But Esteruelas
is concerned that Santos is counting too much on growth and
windfall oil and mining revenues to meet his fiscal goals.
 ""A heavily earnmarked budget, a highly distorted tax system
and a bankrupt healthcare system lie at the heart of Colombia's
fiscal problems,"" Esteruelas said.
 Colombia's central bank expects an economic expansion this
year of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent. Growth forecasts elsewhere
in South America vary widely for 2010, from a likely recession
in Venezuela to an expected boom of 6.5 or more in Brazil, the
region's powerhouse.
 STUBBORN DEFICIT
 In 2003, the first full year of Uribe's rule, Colombia's
deficit was 4.4 percent, the same as 2010's projection.
Economists fault him for not doing more to reduce the shortfall
during the country's 2005-2007 commodities bonanza.
 The ex-president was criticized for high spending meant to
shore up his popularity as he tried and failed to change the
constitution to allow him to run for a third term this year.
 Colombia's finances have also been hurt over the last year
by a trade embargo with neighboring Venezuela, imposed by
leftist President Hugo Chavez in protest of Bogota's close
military alliance with Washington. Santos and Chavez will meet
on Tuesday to try to normalize relations. [ID:nN08229870]
 Uribe has based his career on defeating the Marxist rebels
who killed his father in a kidnapping attempt in the 1980s.
 Technocrat Santos is known for a less personalized
political style but vows to preserve Uribe's basic policies.
 Investors are meanwhile piling into Colombia's oil and
mining sectors, emboldened by increased security brought by
Uribe's U.S.-backed crackdown on leftist insurgents.
 WATERED DOWN REFORMS
 One pension and tax reform proposal after another was
watered down by Congress during Uribe's eight-year rule. And a
health care law, aimed at keeping the system solvent, was
recently struck down by the Constitutional Court.
 Colombia's new finance minister, Juan Carlos Echeverry,
wants to move informal workers onto the tax rolls and cut the
proportion of unregistered businesses in half over 10 years.
 His first big test in Congress will be to pass the ""fiscal
rule"", which is aimed at cutting the central government debt
from 39.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 28.4 percent in 2020. The
market hopes to see the bill become law before year's end.
 Reform of Colombia's mining and oil royalties system and a
bill aimed at stopping the bleeding of public health sector
finances will also be part of Echeverry's initial push.
 The peso on Wednesday ended at 1,822.65 per U.S. dollar,
its strongest in two years. Policymakers are being pressured by
the business community to do something about the situation.
 Exporters, who earn dollars but pay their costs in pesos,
say they are having to lay off workers as profits get hit.
 ""The fiscal reform initiatives in the pipeline will go a
long way in containing peso appreciation pressures,"" JP Morgan
said in a recent note titled, bullishly, ""New administration to
take the fiscal imbalance bull by the horns.""

 * Household mortgages NPL up to 7.3 percent from 6.5 percent
 * Swiss franc's rally hits Hungarian FX mortgage holders

(Adds more detail, background)
 BUDAPEST, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The rate of non-performing loans
in Hungary rose in the first quarter, hit by an increase in
non-performing foreign currency-denominated household mortgages,
financial regulator PSZAF said on Monday.
 The regulator said there could be a further acceleration in
the increase in non-performing household foreign currency loans
in the second quarter, due to the rally of the Swiss franc in
June and July.
 Swiss franc loans make up about 44 percent of Hungary's
entire household debt stock -- and 55 percent of all mortgages,
as a result of massive borrowing in the foreign currency prior
to the 2008 global crisis.
 The regulator said 97,000 household mortgages were more than
90 days late with repayments at end-March.
 The non-performing loan rate within the total credit stock
of the Hungarian financial sector rose to 8.3 percent at the end
of March from 7.8 percent in December, while households'
non-performing loan rate rose to 10.1 percent from 9.3 percent.
 While at the end of December 6.5 percent of household
mortgages - most of which are in Swiss francs -- were more than
90 days late with payment, this rate rose to 7.3 percent by the
end of March 2010, the regulator said in a report.
 It said the increase in non-performing loans, which showed a
steadily slowing pace in previous quarters, picked up again
early this year.
 ""This could, to a significant extent, be related to a strong
appreciation of the Swiss franc versus the forint. A sign of
this is that the rate of late paying household mortgages
increased at a faster than average pace,"" PSZAF said.
 ""It is also noteworthy that a part of previously
restructured loans fell into the late payment category again.""
 The Swiss franc's rally to a record high against the forint
to levels around 219 drove up debt costs for a majority of
Hungarian mortgage holders in July..
 The forint traded at 202-203 versus the franc on Monday, but
still much weaker than the levels at which most mortgages had
been taken out
 The centre-right government, which took office in May, has
banned further foreign currency mortgage lending to households,
but analysts have said the large outstanding stock of forex
loans will remain a key vulnerability for Hungary for years to
come.
 Banks' non-performing household loan rate rose to 8.0
percent from 7.2 at the end of last year, the regulator said.
 The banking sector, however, had showed an improvement in
its profitability and capital position in the first quarter.
 It said key risks for banks were a continued deterioration
of assets and a weakness of the home and car markets. A further
risk was a special tax on banks and a ban on foreign currency
mortgages planned by the government, PSZAF said in its report
which had been drafted before parliament approved the plans.
 The government wants to raise 200 billion forints in taxes
from the financial sector both this year and in 2011 in order to
plug budget holes, in a move criticised by the banking sector
and Hungary's lenders, the International Monetary Fund and the
European Union.

 TOKYO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The yen's current rise is too rapid
and could prompt the Japanese authorities to step up their verbal
warnings, a former senior Bank of Japan official said on Monday,
as the yen approached 15-year highs against the dollar .
 But Eiji Hirano, who attended Group of Seven meetings while
at the BOJ, also said Tokyo is unlikely to be able to convince
the United States and Europe to intervene in markets to weaken
the yen.
 ""If the pace of the yen's rise is too fast, Japan may try to
check it by showing its readiness to intervene,"" Hirano, who was
assistant governor at the BOJ until 2006, said in an interview
with Reuters.
 ""But current foreign exchange levels are the natural
reflection of changing monetary policies in the United States and
Europe and the fact that Japan has not changed its policy. Japan
is thus unlikely to obtain other nations' consent for launching a
solo intervention.""
 On the Bank of Japan's monetary policy review on Tuesday,
Hirano said the time is not ripe for the central bank to take
fresh action.
 ""It cannot be said that the economy's gradual recovery will
fall to pieces because of the yen's appreciation ... But the
focus will be how the BOJ judges the economy's outlook and how it
will respond to downside risks in the future,"" Hirano said.
 He said downside risks are growing not only because of
developed economies' poor performances but also emerging
economies' recent policy tightening.

globe, is now executive vice president of Toyota Financial

 LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive
against major currencies on Monday, as disappointing U.S. jobs
data on Friday highlighted a weakening U.S. economic outlook and
added to speculation about further monetary easing.
 Market players refrained from chasing prices aggressively,
having already priced in some form of modest easing at the U.S.

 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Aug 9 (Reuters) - German exports should approach
record levels next year after beating forecasts in June, data
showed, in the clearest sign yet that foreign demand is driving
a stronger than expected recovery in Europe's largest economy.
 Exports rose by 3.8 percent, the Federal Statistics Office
said on Monday, and analysts said the figure underpinned
expectations that gross domestic product data due this week
would show growth accelerated in the second quarter after a
harsh winter cooled activity at the start of the year.
 German exports should jump 11 percent in 2010 as a whole and
8 percent in 2011, meaning they would likely almost reach 2008's
record level next year, the chambers of industry and commerce
(DIHK) said in a separate survey. [ID:nBAF004204]
 The DIHK said imports had also risen sharply, suggesting a
corresponding pickup in hitherto sluggish domestic activity
which Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said pointed to a more
broad-based upturn.
""Foreign trade will likely have contributed significantly to
German economic growth,"" said Simon Junker at Unicredit.
""Today's figures suggest that even our optimistic forecast of
1.5 percent growth versus the first quarter will be exceeded.""
 The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of 34 economists is
for growth to accelerate to 1.3 percent in the second quarter
from 0.2 percent in the January-March period. 
 The seasonally adjusted rise in exports in June beat
expectations for a 1.0 percent gain and took the trade surplus
to 12.3 billion euros from 10.6 billion in May.
 Imports rose 1.9 percent on the month, smashing the
consensus forecast for a 2.0 percent drop.
 Separate data for August from researchers Sentix showed
investor sentiment in the euro zone rose by much more than
expected to its highest level since December 2007.
[ID:nBAF004203]
 
 'MADE IN GERMANY'
 ""With still strong demand, particularly from Asia, for goods
'Made in Germany' ... German manufacturers are looking into a
bright near-term future,"" said Carsten Brzeski at ING. ""Filled
order books speak volumes.""
 German manufacturing orders surpassed expectations in June,
rising 3.2 percent on the month, data showed last week.
 Many German companies are profiting from growth in emerging
markets. Out of 26 DAX companies that have reported earnings for
the quarter to end-June, 19 beat market expectations. Ten hiked
their outlooks, and the remaining 16 kept them unchanged.
 Speciality chemicals company Lanxess, which is not a DAX
constituent, on Friday raised its 2010 outlook after strong
demand in emerging markets helped it post forecast-beating
quarterly profits.
 The rise in demand for German goods is outpacing global
growth in exports, the DIHK said, adding: ""Within three years,
the crisis in exports will have been overcome.""
 Leading indicators have suggested an export-driven recovery
is helping Germany to grow faster than expected, leaving behind
poorer euro zone countries hit by a sovereign debt crisis that
they are still battling to overcome.
 A purchasing managers' survey released on Wednesday showed
strong growth in the services sector in Germany but weakness in
southern Europe. German business morale also leapt last month to
its highest level in 3 years.
 Surging imports offer another positive sign, Minister
Bruederle said.
 ""The dynamic development in imports shows that the pickup in
the domestic market is progressing and the economic recovery is
gaining in breadth and firming,"" he said in a statement.
 Imports will likely grow 9.5 percent in 2010 and 2011,
according to the DIHK, reaching a new record level next year.
China is set to replace Holland as the country delivering most
goods to Germany.
 Economists warned however that a stronger euro and potential
slowdown in foreign demand may weigh on German exports in the
coming months.
 ""In the second half of the year, there will be a slowdown as
certain important trade partners such as the United States will
have problems,"" said Bernd Weidensteiner at Commerzbank.

 ""German exports are benefiting from the positive development

 LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive
against major currencies on Monday, as disappointing U.S. jobs
data on Friday highlighted a weakening U.S. economic outlook.
 Market players were wary of chasing prices aggressively
ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday,
with expectations mounting for some form of additional monetary
easing.
 ""The U.S. employment report was disappointing, and leaves a
close call whether the Fed will take more steps tomorrow,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

85.02 yen versus the dollar on trading platform EBS on Friday,
just shy of a 15-year peak of 84.82 yen hit last November.
 By 0735 GMT, the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 85.67 yen. Hefty
buy orders were seen in the 84.90-85.00 yen area.

fell 131,000 in July, while private employment, a better gauge
of labour market health, rose a modest 71,000, below forecasts
for a gain of 90,000.
 
 CENTRAL BANKS EYED
 The euro was steady on the day at $1.3289, staying within
sight of a three-month peak of $1.3334 struck on Friday.
 The dollar's general weakness could keep the euro buoyant in
the near term, but profit taking on a rally in euro/dollar is

 The dollar index was little moved at 80.377. Support was
seen at the April low of 80.031 and March trough of 79.507,
analysts said.
 The market has been factoring in expectations the Federal

mortgage bond holdings to buy new mortgage or Treasury bonds,
although the amount itself would not be large.

to relax its monetary policy tomorrow. In fact, it's so priced
into the market that share prices could fall if the Fed doesn't
do it,"" a trader at a European bank said.
 The Bank of Japan also kicked off a two-day policy meeting.
As long as the yen's climb is gradual, it is likely to keep
policy steady when it concludes its meeting on Tuesday, analysts
said.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - World stocks edged up towards last
week's three-month peak on Monday while the dollar held near a
15-year low versus the yen on rising expectations the Federal
Reserve could soon buy bonds to support the economy.
 Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data in July fanned
speculation the Fed may send a clear signal when it meets on
Tuesday that it is prepared to print more money to counter
renewed economic weakness.
 The prospect of the Fed increasing the amount of cash
floating around the financial system through purchases of U.S.
bonds has been dragging on the dollar, while the possibility of
even greater economic stimulus aided risky assets.
 ""A downgrading of its economic and inflation assessment may
be considered a potential precursor to renewed action in coming
months should things not start to improve,"" said Tom Levinson,
currency strategist at ING.
The MSCI world equity index rose 0.3 percent while the
Thomson Reuters global stock index gained the same amount.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose more than 1.2 percent on the
day while emerging stocks added half a percent.
 U.S. stock futures rose 0.3 percent, pointing to a firmer
open on Wall Street later.
 The dollar slipped towards a 15-year low below 85 yen before
reversing to 85.61. It was steady against a basket of major
currencies.
 ""With the unemployment rate rising, we now expect the FOMC
to re-engage in unconventional easing through asset purchases
(of U.S. Treasuries) and/or a more ironclad commitment to lower
short rates,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.
 ""While a close call, we think the FOMC will announce that
they will reinvest the paydown of Mortgage Backed Securities in
the bond market. This would probably be packaged as 'preventing
a tightening' but the market is likely to see it as a step -
albeit a baby one - towards renewed easing.""
 The positive correlation between U.S. and Japanese two-year
yield spreads, which have been narrowing, and the dollar/yen
rate has strengthened to its highest since the period just after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers two years ago.
 Given that, investors believe it is only a matter of time
before the dollar hits a 15-year low against the yen.
 A weaker dollar helped U.S. crude oil rise 1.1 percent to
$81.60 a barrel.
 The bund futures was steady.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged higher on
Monday on growing speculation the Federal Reserve will have to
buy bonds sooner rather than later to bolster the sagging
economy, which is keeping the U.S. dollar under pressure.
 Major European stock futures were up as much as 1.5
percent, reacting positively to a late session rally on Wall
Street on Friday that saw major indexes cut earlier losses.
 A steady flow of downbeat U.S. economic data, including
disappointingly large job losses in July, has fueled
expectations the Fed will have to take bolder action to
stimulate growth, even with interest rates already near zero.
 The central bank may signal a move is coming after a
meeting on Tuesday.
 The prospect of the Fed increasing the amount of cash
floating around the financial system through purchases of U.S.
bonds has been dragging on the dollar, but potentially stronger
economic stimulus helped to buoy Asian equities on Monday.
 ""The market seems to be anticipating a shift in Fed policy
towards renewed quantitative easing,"" said Andrew Pease,
investment strategist, Asia Pacific for Russell Investments in
Sydney.
 ""Against this backdrop, the relative resilience of Asia is
probably a function of the better structural economic
underpinnings in Asia ex Japan and perhaps some confidence that
more aggressive QE by the Fed will eventually succeed.""
 The main event of the week will be the Fed's message on
monetary policy on Tuesday. In addition, Chinese economic data
this week are expected to confirm growth has plateaued for now,
though exports and imports will still probably rise at a
double-digit annual pace.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan equities rose 0.6
percent to its highest since May 4.
 Since June, the index has advanced 12 percent, exceeding an
8 percent gain on the all-country world index and a 5 percent
rise in the U.S. S&P 500 index
 Strength in emerging Asian equities is all the more
striking since it has coincided with equity outperformance, a
tell-tale sign that investors are focused on the region's
relatively solid long-term growth prospects and healthier
financial systems.
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.7 percent, however, as
investors focused on the negative impact of a stronger yen on
exporters. Electronics components maker Kyocera Corp stock fell
2 percent and was the biggest drag on the index.
 UPTREND IN YEN
 The U.S. dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 85.50 yen but was
still within striking distance of a 15-year low of 84.81, below
which dealers were concerned of possible government
intervention to weaken the Japanese currency.
 The yen gained around 5 percent against the dollar in the
second quarter. So far in the current quarter it is up 3
percent, with an upward trend that has been brutal for
exporters but a blessing for importers showing no signs of
ending.
 ""After the poor jobs data, the focus is now on whether the
Fed will further ease its monetary policy. The yen has already
risen to around 85 yen (per dollar) on expectations that the
Fed might do so,"" said Mitsuo Shimizu, deputy general manager
at Cosmo Securities in Tokyo.
 However, short-term investors should take heed. They have
amassed a large collective bet against the U.S. currency, and
usually such a big position is vulnerable to reversals.
 Speculators on the International Monetary Market in the
week ended Aug. 3 had a net short dollar position of $15.5
billion, the largest since December 2009.
 Developed government bond prices ticked higher after a
rally in U.S. Treasuries on Friday. At one point in that rally,
speculation that the Fed will buy debt to pull down market
rates knocked the U.S. 10-year yield to a 15-month low.
 Ten-year Japanese government bond futures were up 0.3
points getting closer to a 7-year high hit last week. In the
cash market, the 10-year yield fell 3.5 basis points to 1.02
percent moving closer to a seven-year low of 0.995 percent
touched last week.
 ""Depending on what the Fed does at the meeting the 10-year
yield could try for 0.95 percent. The 1 percent threshold is
seen as less of a barrier now that it has been breached once,""
said Katsutoshi Inadome, a fixed-income strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.
 U.S. Treasury futures were flat on the day
 Commodities prices got a boost from continued dollar
weakness. U.S. crude for September delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$81.26 a barrel having risen 12 percent since June.
 However, U.S. wheat prices fell 4.6 percent adding to a 7
percent decline on Friday.
 Chicago wheat futures surged to a two-year high last week
after Russia banned exports of the grain, which also fueled
fears of a spike in food inflation, but profit taking has
cooled prices since.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2010 12:28AM ET</span>",Q+A-Implications of inflation for India coalition," By Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Headline inflation in India
may touch 11 percent for July, its sixth straight month in
double digits, making high prices the single biggest political
and policy challenge for a government voted in on a pro-poor
agenda.
 WHY ARE PRICES HIGH?
 India's headline inflation has been rising sharply since
the middle of 2009 for several reasons -- a bad drought that
hit farm output, higher fuel prices, supply bottlenecks. and
demand-side pressures in an economy growing at around 9
percent.
 Both consumer and wholesale price indices are now in
double-digits, making Indian inflation the highest by far among
large economies. Other factors fuelling price rises are the
fact factories running at capacity, skills shortages, and a 33
percent annual rise in urban housing costs.
 WHAT COULD BE THE POLITICAL FALLOUT?
 A year-long spell of double-digit food inflation has
sparked street protests, and two weeks ago the opposition
blocked parliamentary proceedings for a week over the issue.
 The Congress Party could be hit in major state elections in
early 2011, including in eastern West Bengal and southern Tamil
Nadu states. Inflation also worries Congress allies, two of
which face elections in their stronghold states, and political
expediency may force them to distance themselves from anything
that angers voters.
 But they are unlikely to bring down the government, and
national polls are not until 2014.
 WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS?
 Stubbornly high inflation could dent economic growth, which
is projected at 8.5 percent in the year ending March 2011.
Aggressive monetary tightening to counter inflation could also
lead to an increase in borrowing costs for the government which
are projected at about $100 billion in the 2010/11 fiscal year.
 It could also lead to a slowdown in the capital expenditure
plans of corporates, possibly putting pressure on earnings.
 A high interest rate economy also attracts more capital
flows which will be useful for financing India's current
account deficit but could lead to a stronger rupee, hitting
exports and putting pressure on the trade deficit.
 Also, the government, with an eye on voters, has left open
the option of intervening if global crude prices soar after
lifting price controls on gasoline in June. If the government
intervenes to subsidise fuel, it may impact efforts to keep the
fiscal deficit below the forecast 5.5 percent of GDP in
2010/11.
 Unless New Delhi accelerates efforts to improve farm
output, it will be forced to rely more on costly imports and
subsidies, exacerbating a stressed fiscal position.
 WHAT COULD THE CENTRAL BANK DO?
 Inflation is now generalised and demand side pressures are
clearly evident. The central bank has responded by raising
interest rates four times since March, most recently on July 27
when it hiked the reverse repo rate by 50 basis points, more
forcefully than expected to absorb excess cash.
 With inflation a dominant concern and an economic recovery
firmly in place, the stage appears set for more tightening. A
Reuters poll after the July 27 policy review found economists
expect the central bank to lift rates aggressively, with most
forecasting a further increase in rates by 25 basis points by
the end of September. [ID:nBMA008098]
 WILL PRICES COME DOWN?
 Unlikely in the near term. The growth-focused government
appears resigned to elevated inflation, which has consistently
outrun its forecasts.
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has said inflation is a
price to pay for rapid growth. There are suggestions in the
government of a ""new normal"" of inflation running at 6 to 8
percent, from the roughly 5 percent considered acceptable by
policymakers in recent years.
 WILL A GOOD MONSOON HELP?
 Maybe moderately.
 Monsoon rains will slow rising food costs, while the base
effect after a year of sharply rising prices will soon kick-in,
pushing inflation down to single-digits. But other bottlenecks
persist, including a gap between farm output and demand. High
inflation has persisted despite tightening of monetary policy
this year, including the shifting of the operative rate from
the reverse repo to the repo.
 But monetary policy is not enough to curb demand from
India's rural poor, who are spending their rising incomes on
food. Foodgrain production has risen less than 1 percent a year
in the past decade even as per capita incomes have roughly
doubled.

 * Dollar bids seen at Y84.90-85.00, stop-losses below that
 * Activity light, with public holiday in Singapore
 * BOJ starts 2-day policy meeting, no policy moves expected
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against the yen on
Monday, slipping towards a 15-year low, after a disappointing
U.S. July payrolls report boosted talk the Federal Reserve could
consider further easing monetary policy as early as this week.
 The dollar stood at 85.43 yen, down 0.1 percent from levels
seen in late U.S. trade on Friday when it hit an eight-month
trough of 85.02 yen on trading platform EBS.
 Players were nervously watching whether the greenback would
fall beyond its November low of 84.82 yen, which would take it to
its lowest in 15 years.
 A fall beyond the November milestone could open the way for
the greenback to slide to an all-time low below 80 yen, hit in
1995, and could fuel talk of Japanese intervention to rein in the
yen's climb.
 Dollar/yen saw light selling in early Asian trade, while some
demand underpinned the greenback, traders said. Hefty buy orders
were seen in the 84.90-85.00 yen area, but below that awaits a
minefield of stop-loss orders, they said.
 ""Figures in the U.S. jobs data were poor, supporting views
that the dollar will further weaken against the yen, although
there is no sense of panic in the market,"" said a trader at a
European bank.
 ""Most players now expect the Fed to discuss additional steps
to relax its monetary policy tomorrow. In fact, it's so priced
into the market that share prices could fall if the Fed doesn't
do it,"" the trader said.
 The Fed's policy-setting committee meets on Tuesday.
 Data showed on Friday that overall U.S. non-farm payrolls
fell 131,000 in July, while private employment, a better gauge of
labour market health, rose a modest 71,000, below forecasts for a
gain of 90,000.
 The employment report has sent two-year U.S. Treasury yields
to record lows, further hurting the dollar's yield appeal.
 The positive correlation between U.S. and Japanese two-year
yield spreads, which have been narrowing, and the dollar/yen rate
has strengthened to its highest since the period just after the
Lehman-shock two years ago.
 Given that correlation, players believe it is a matter of the
time before the dollar hits a 15-year low against the yen.
 Activity was subdued in Asian trade as financial markets in
Singapore were shut for a national holiday, while many Japanese
investors were gone for the summer ""Obon"" holidays this week.
 CENTRAL BANK MEETINGS IN FOCUS
 Traders and analysts said the dollar is seen extending its
slide if the Fed on Tuesday considers, or even launches, an
additional policy easing measure to help support a U.S. recovery
that looks as if it is losing momentum.
 ""The dollar is highly likely to fall below 85 yen, possibly
dropping beyond 84 yen if the Fed mentions a concrete plan to
help the economy,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at
Barclays Capital.
 ""Meanwhile, a sense of urgency is still missing among
Japanese authorities, with regards to possible market
intervention.""
 The Bank of Japan also meets this week. As long as the yen's
climb is a gradual one, the central bank is likely to stand pat
on policy at its Aug. 9-10 meeting and stick to its view that the
economy is on track for a moderate recovery.
 But it is closely watching market moves and may consider
easing policy further if the yen soars towards an all-time high
against the dollar at a pace fast enough to damage business
sentiment.
 The euro was steady on the day at $1.3281, staying within
sight of a three-month peak of $1.3334 struck on Friday. The
dollar's general weakness could keep the euro buoyant in the
near-term, but profit-taking on a rally in euro/dollar is
expected to increase as the euro approaches the psychologically
key 1.3500 level. That level almost coincides with the 50 percent
retracement of the single European currency's fall from a
November peak of $1.5145 to a four-year trough of $1.1876 hit in
June.
 Analysts said the greenback could benefit when investors
pocket profits on the euro. The dollar is also likely to receive
support as the dollar index approaches technically important
levels, such as its April low of 80.031 and March trough of
79.507, analysts said.
 The dollar index was little moved at 80.377.

decide on August 21 whether Prime Minister Julia Gillard's
centre-left Labor or Tony Abbott's conservative opposition will
hold power for the next three years.
 Here are policy differences between the government, the
conservative Liberal-National opposition, which launched its
campaign on Sunday, and the Greens party, expected to hold the
balance of power in the Senate after the election.
 TAX
 * GOVERNMENT: A proposed 30 percent tax on coal and iron
ore mining profits from 2012. Company tax cut from 30 percent
to 29 percent from 2012-13 for small business, and from 2013-14
for big companies. Tax cuts to offset for higher employer
payments into worker pension funds, from 9 percent to 12
percent, by 2019-20.
 * OPPOSITION: Promises to kill off the government's
proposed mining tax on the first day of a conservative
government. Cut company tax to 28.5 percent from 30 percent
from July 2013. But big companies pay a matching 1.5 percent
levy to fund parental leave policy. To announce tax reform
agenda within 12 months.
 * GREENS: Miners should pay more tax, but the money should
be kept in a fund. Has not rejected new mining tax, but
critical of watered-down version, and demands scrutiny of
details.
 ECONOMY
 * GOVERNMENT: Budget to return to small surplus from
2012-13 and a 2 percent cap on new expenditure pending bigger
surpluses.
 * OPPOSITION: Produce a national economic blueprint within
a month. Stronger control on spending and cut 12,000 public
service jobs with a two-year recruitment freeze. Faster pay
down of government debt, and return to surplus budgets from
2012-13.
 * GREENS: Supported the $42 billion stimulus package, which
saw Australia avoid recession in 2009, after winning an extra
$400 million for various issues. With the economy improving,
now say the stimulus should be wound back.
 PARENTAL LEAVE
 * GOVERNMENT: Fund 18 weeks on minimum wage from January
2011.
 * OPPOSITION: A 1.5 percent tax on companies earning more
than A$5 million ($4.5 million), to fund 26-week leave scheme
on the mother's wage, up to A$150,000. Scheme to start in 2012.
 * GREENS: Want to improve the government's Paid Parental
Leave scheme by extending it from 18 to 26 weeks, plus
superannuation, and guarantee to leave.
 TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 * GOVERNMENT: Build a $33 billion super-fast national
broadband network. The plan involves an A$11 billion deal with
phone giant Telstra to use its infrastructure.
 * OPPOSITION: Will scrap the national broadband network to
save at least A$18 billion.
 CLIMATE:
 * GOVERNMENT: A 5 percent carbon emissions cut by 2020.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2010 03:08AM ET</span>",Egypt will not raise local wheat prices - paper," CAIRO, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Egypt will not raise local wheat
prices or cut bread subsidies after a Russian wheat export ban
sent world prices soaring, a government minister was quoted as
saying by a state newspaper on Sunday.
 Egypt consumes around 14 million tonnes of wheat annually
and relies on foreign supplies for about half of its
requirement, making it the world's largest wheat importer.
 Hefty state subsidies keep bread affordable in Egypt, where
one fifth of the population lives on less than $1 per day
according to U.N. figures.
 ""The subsidy programme will not be affected as a result of
this sudden price hike,"" Social Solidarity Minister Ali
Musailhi was quoted as saying by al-Ahram newspaper. ""We have
no intention of raising the prices of subsidised commodities.""
 Finance Minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali said in June he
aimed to cut subsidies, which make up around a quarter of state
spending, in order to raise spending on education, health and
other social services in the 2010-2011 fiscal year without
increasing the deficit.
 The government's subsidy budget assumes an average wheat
price of $200 per tonne compared to a recent market price of
$240, according to a CI Capital research note.
 Russia imposed the temporary wheat export ban after the
worst heatwave on record ravaged crops, pushing wheat prices to
their highest in almost two years.
 Egypt has signed contracts for the purchase of 540,000
tonnes of wheat from Russia for delivery between Aug. 1 and
Sept. 10 and is now seeking an additional 60,000 tonnes of
wheat per month to make up for the shortfall.
 Egyptians traditionally increase their consumption of wheat
during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this
week.
 Egyptian authorities are scheduled to hold an emergency
meeting later on Sunday to draft a plan to ease the effect of
the Russian export ban, the trade ministry said on Sunday.
 Nomani Nomani, chairman of Egypt's General Authority for
Supply Commodities (GASC), said on Thursday Egypt had more than
four months' wheat supply for the local market, but that GASC
was ""continuously present"" in the international market.

 By Selam Gebrekidan
 NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell a third
straight day on Friday, weighed down by a weak U.S. jobs report
that also pulled Wall Street lower.
 But the dollar's <.DXY> broad slump and weakness against
the euro  tempered oil's losses, and prices managed to
settle above $80 a barrel, a higher finish versus a week ago.
 U.S. crude for September  delivery fell $1.31 or 1.6
percent to settle at $80.70 a barrel, having traded from $80.04
to $82.67.
 Prices, which settled on Tuesday at a three-month high
above $82, finished the week up $1.75, or 2.21 percent from
last Friday's $78.95 settlement. Crude hit as high as $82.97 a
barrel on Wednesday -- the highest since May 4 -- before ending
that session lower following a government report showed a sharp
rise in gasoline and distillate stocks last week.
 On Friday, front-month ICE Brent crude  fell $1.45
to settle at $80.16 a barrel.
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell 131,000 in July, declining for
the second straight month, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Employers did add 71,000 private sector jobs, but that was less
than the expected gain of 90,000.
 The total job losses exceeded the 65,000 drop analysts had
expected and the report's weakness added to concerns about
the outlook for energy demand and the economy. [ID:nN05598486]
 The unemployment rate was pegged at 9.5 percent, steady
with June and lower than the 9.6 percent analysts expected.
Hiring in June was much weaker than previously thought, the
report said.
 ""The oil market's response to the jobs data appeared
appropriate from our view and support within the $80-81 area
has thus far held. However, the ability to remain north of $80
could be challenged next week amid what we see as some further
slippage in the equities,"" said Jim Ritterbusch at Ritterbusch
and associates in Galena, Illinois.
 The dollar approached a 15-year low against the yen and a
three-month low against the euro after the jobs data came out
on Friday. [USD/]
 U.S stocks fell after the nonfarm payroll report, with
consumer stocks among the biggest losers. [ID:nN06207729]
 ""Crude oil prices have been following the stock market for
months now. Stocks got hammered by the jobless data today and
oil prices were tracking right along,"" said Mark Waggoner,
president of Excel Futures Inc in Bend, Oregon.
 Waggoner said he was watching the market to see if prices
dropped below $79.60 a barrel, which he thought could send them
back in last week's $72 to $79 a barrel trading range.

 Industry sources kept watching developments in the Middle
East including Israel's border clash with Lebanon and Iran's
dispute with the West over Tehran's nuclear program.
 Concern about being too short at the weekend with turmoil
simmering in the Middle East could support oil prices, sources
said.
 Adding more uncertainty to the market, the UAE said on
Friday that militants attacked the Japanese supertanker that

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar approached a
15-year low against the yen on Friday and fell against the euro
after news that the United States' economy shed twice as many
jobs in July as expected added to worries about the recovery.
 Analysts said the weak jobs report, combined with a recent
string of poor data may lead the Federal Reserve to renew
Treasury and mortgage bond purchases to jolt the economy. That
would drag U.S. Treasury benchmark yields even lower and
further dampen returns in dollar-denominated assets.
 ""It's just not safe to hold dollars. Quantitative easing is
back on the table and it will push yields even lower,"" said
Douglas Borthwick, head trader at Faros Trading LLC, in
Stamford, Connecticut. ""There are very few reasons out there to
buy it.""
 While U.S. employers did add 71,000 private-sector jobs in
July, that was below forecasts for a gain of 90,000, helping to
push the euro to a three-month high above $1.33. Total non-farm
payrolls fell as temporary government jobs to conduct the
census dropped.
 The dollar fell as low as 85.03 yen -- its lowest level
since November and near a 15-year trough beneath 85.
 Sterling hit a six-month high near $1.60.
 The jobs report ""is really going to deepen concerns about
the health of the labor market, and that increases the odds of
the Federal Reserve having to implement fresh stimulus measures
to jump-start the recovery,"" said Joe Manimbo, analyst at
Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington.
 The data also drove U.S. 2-year Treasury note yields to the
latest in a string of record lows, further undermining the
dollar's appeal.
 Analysts also said things do not look likely to get better
for the greenback ahead of the Fed's next policy meeting on
Tuesday.
 William Reekstin, a director with Direct Access Partners,
in New York, said the dollar is in a consolidation mode against
its counterparts and that the euro will find resistance to
further gains at $1.3416.
 WATCHING THE YEN
 The dollar last traded down 0.5 percent at 85.43 yen, still
above a 15-year low of 84.81 yen and its all-time trough below
80 yen, according to Reuters data.
 Support around 85 yen has held despite a number of assaults
on that psychological level.
 Boris Schlossberg, director of research at GFT Forex in New
York, said the dollar will eventually break that level, ""if not
today, then early next week, as currency traders price in
declining yields in the U.S. bond market.""
 A dip below 85 yen could increase volatility and push
Japanese officials to try to talk down the yen.
 Several lawmakers have warned that action may be warranted
to weaken the yen and restore Japan's trade competitiveness,
though analysts think it would take an extremely rapid rise to
trigger an outright intervention.
 EURO, STERLING RISE
 The euro was last up 0.7 percent at $1.3281 after earlier
hitting $1.3333 -- its highest level since May.
 A weekly close above $1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement
of the euro's November-to-June slide, looks likely and,
strategists said, would be a bullish sign pointing to more euro
gains.
 Sterling rose 0.5 percent to $1.5961, its best showing
against the greenback since February. Traders said that $1.5910
was now seen as support should the pound retreat. The
dollar rose against its Canadian counterpart after data showed
Canada's economy shed 9,300 jobs in July, compared with
forecasts for a gain of 15,000.

 NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - World stock markets and the
dollar slumped on Friday as investors fled to safe-haven bonds
and gold after U.S. employment data signaled the economic
recovery was losing traction.
 The U.S. economy lost 131,000 jobs in July as more
temporary U.S. census jobs ended, and private employers added
fewer workers to their payrolls than expected in July. For
details, see [ID:nN05598486]
 U.S. employment has become a major focus for investors as
the economy shows signs of weakness while U.S. and European

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2010 11:52AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Russia grain woes not on par with 07/08 crisis-OECD," PARIS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The impact of crop damage and
export curbs in drought-stricken Russia is not comparable to
upheaval in global commodity markets in 2007/08 that sparked
food inflation and social unrest, the OECD said on Friday.
 The worst drought on record in Russia has withered crops and
prompted the country to halt grain exports, sparking a surge in
world wheat prices to levels not seen since 2008.
 But with global grain stocks at much higher levels than in
2007/08 and crop conditions elsewhere in the world generally
benign, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Development
and Cooperation said there were no grounds for talking about a
global agricultural crisis.
 ""At this stage it's much too early to make comparisons with
the 2007/08 price spike,"" Ken Ash, the OECD's director of trade
and agriculture, told Reuters by telephone.
 The current tensions were also focused on the wheat market
whereas the previous price spike affected a range of food
staples and was fuelled by soaring energy markets, he said.
 The OECD did not plan to revise its price or production
outlook, Ash said, adding its previous forecast for 2010 Russian
wheat output was not far from current estimates in the market.
 He reiterated the OECD's opposition to export restrictions,
which it sees as making international prices more volatile and
as depriving farmers of an incentive to grow more by curbing
domestic prices.
 ""I think probably what we're seeing now is not fundamental
supply and demand factors...but market expectations,"" he said.
 Benchmark U.S. wheat prices almost doubled between early
June and Friday's session before pulling back partially on
profit-taking and news that Russia could end its export ban
sooner than announced.

 * Ethiopia predicts $3 billion for 2010/2011
 * Wants to diversify into leather, vegetables
 
 By Barry Malone
 ADDIS ABABA, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Resurgent coffee sales and
diversification into other products lifted Ethiopia's exports to
a record $2 billion in 2009/2010 from $1.5 billion in the
previous year, the trade ministry told Reuters on Friday.
 ""Coffee has bounced back to $528 million this year,"" trade
ministry spokesman, Amakale Yimam, told Reuters.
 Ethiopia's export total fell well short of the $2.9 billion
predicted by Minister of Trade, Girma Birru, in an interview
with Reuters in November.
 But Amakale said the Horn of Africa nation projected $3
billion in export revenue for 2010/2011 based on growth in new
export commodities.
 ""Diversification has also helped our exports,"" Amakale said.
""We're going to make more money from leather products and
vegetables and flowers ... So we're confident we can make $3
billion.""
 In 2008/2009 (June/July), coffee earnings in Africa's
biggest coffee exporter slumped to just $375.8 million after bad
weather obliterated entire crops in some growing zones.
 Exports last year were also shaken by Japan's insistence on
testing beans on arrival after it found some were contaminated
with pesticides. Japan, which buys almost 20 percent of
Ethiopia's beans, has resumed imports.
 Ethiopia prides itself on being the birthplace of coffee.
Some 15 million smallholder farmers grow the crop, mostly in
forested highlands in the west of the country.
 Coffee accounted for some 60 percent of Ethiopia's foreign
exchange revenue in the 2007/2008 season, when it earned more
than $525 million in export revenue.
 
 DIVERSIFICATION
 Despite the rebound, coffee exports amounted to little more
than a quarter of the total in 2009/2010, the figures showed.
 Flower exports accounted for $158 million in 2009/2010, an
increase of 20.9 percent, Amakale said. Vegetable exports were
just $32 million, but the sector is seen by the government as an
industry with strong potential growth.
 Ethiopia's exports were also boosted in 2009/2010 by growing
sesame exports and by buoyant foreign sales of a narcotic leaf
known as khat, Amakale said.
 Ethiopia this year earned $209 million from khat, a 50
percent increase on 2008/2009, and $129 million from sesame -- a
boost of 30 percent. Ethiopia is the world's fourth-largest
sesame exporter after China, India and Myanmar.
 Gold exports tripled to $300 million dollars in 2009/2010,
Amakale said. 
 The country has made $450.5 million from about 48 tonnes of
gold exports in the last 10 years, according to the central
National Bank of Ethiopia.
 The only export commodity that showed a fall in revenue was
leather.
 ""We earned $56.5 million from leather this year, which was a
25 percent decrease,"" Amakale said. ""But that is because we are
in a transition phase, trying to move from exporting raw
material to finished goods like handbags and shoes.""
 The Ethiopian government predicts growth of about 10 percent
for 2010/2011. The International Monetary Fund says the economy
will grow by 7 percent.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar approached a
15-year low against the yen on Friday and fell against the euro
after data showed the United States shed twice as many jobs in
July as economists expected, adding to worries about recovery.
 While U.S. employers did add 71,000 private sector jobs,
that was also less than expectations for a 90,000 gain, and
helped push the euro  to a three-month high above $1.33.
The dollar fell to 85.08 yen , its lowest level since
November and near a 15-year trough beneath 85.
 For more on the data, please see [ID:nN06202981].
 The jobs report ""is really going to deepen concerns about
the health of the labor market, and that increases the odds of
the Federal Reserve having to implement fresh stimulus measures
to jump start the recovery,"" said Joe Manimbo, analyst at
Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. ""Nothing in
there to argue for a firmer dollar.""
 The data also drove two-year U.S. Treasury 
yields to the latest in a string of record lows, further
undermining the dollar's yield appeal.
 Analysts said things don't look likely to get better for
the dollar ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting on
Tuesday. A string of weak U.S. economic data fed speculation
this week that the central bank could renew Treasury and
mortgage bond purchases to jolt the economy back to health.
 ""It's just not safe to hold dollars. Quantitative easing is
back on the table and it will push yields even lower,"" said
Douglas Borthwick, head trader at Faros Trading in Stamford,
Connecticut. ""There are very few reasons out there to buy it.""
 WATCHING THE YEN
 The dollar was down 0.7 percent at 85.22 yen . It was
was near a 15-year low of 84.81 yen and its all-time trough
around 79 yen.
 For now, traders are disposed to sell yen around the 85
level, said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at GFT
Forex in New York. But he said the level will eventually break,
""if not today, then early next week, as currency traders price
in declining yields in the U.S. bond market.""
 A dip below 85 yen could increase volatility and push
Japanese officials to talk try to talk down the yen.
 Several lawmakers have warned that action may be warranted
to weaken the yen and restore Japanese trade competitiveness,
though analysts think it would take an extremely rapid rise to
trigger outright intervention.
 EURO, STERLING RISE
 The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.3320, its highest level
since May, according to Reuters data. A close above $1.3125,
the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's November-to-June
slide, looks like and, strategists said, would be a bullish
sign pointing to more euro gains.
 Sterling  rose 0.6 percent to $1.5999, its best
showing against the greenback since February. Traders said the
$1.5910 was now seen as support should the pound retreat.

 * Those that shun IMF are eventually pushed to austerity
 * High funding needs may raise pressure on govt
 By Michael Winfrey
 Economics Correspondent, Central Europe and the Balkans
 PRAGUE, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Hungary hopes to emulate the few
countries that have spurned IMF aid and emerge from crisis on
their own, but it is much more likely to follow the example of
other crisis-hit EU states and be forced back to austerity.
 It is no Malaysia or Turkey, the first of which rejected the
International Monetary Fund's demand it open its economy in the
1990s Asia crisis and the latter weaned itself off IMF backup in
2008 after enacting its own Fund-like fiscal plan.
 It more resembles Latvia or Greece, whose high public debt,
large budget deficits and dependence on foreign financing
eventually overruled their opposition to the Fund's usual diet
of belt tightening and other reforms.
 Budapest's debt, at 80 percent of annual output, is much
lower than Athens' or Riga's and just above the European Union
average, but it must roll over a fifth of its borrowing next
year amid lingering doubts over the bloc's weakest members.
 That is the main sticking point in Prime Minister Viktor
Orban's decision last month to declare talks with the IMF over
and pursue a pro-growth, anti-austerity strategy.
 What is more likely, economists said, is his tax cuts for
small businesses and a pledge to end four years of belt
tightening will result in higher deficits that will drive up
borrowing costs and hit the forint before he is forced to revert
to the more traditional cost-cutting route.
 ""You're trying this pro-growth strategy, it doesn't really
boost your revenue, and eventually the money runs out,"" said
Daniel Hewitt, an economist at Barclay's Capital.
 Markets have held off punishing the central European country
of 10 million, believing Orban and his centre-right Fidesz party
are posturing ahead of Oct. 3 local elections and will
eventually clinch a deal once their campaign concludes.
 But so far his rhetoric echoes that of other leaders who
have rejected IMF help, portraying the IMF as an interloper from
whom Budapest must wrest back its economic autonomy.
 
 SUCCESS STORIES
 That was the strategy of Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip
Erdogan, who walked away from a new IMF deal last year.
 The difference is Turkey has a track record of its own
austerity and now plans to cut its deficit to 1 percent of gross
domestic product in 10 years, from 5.5 percent in 2009. Its debt
of 45.5 percent of GDP is much lower than Hungary's.
 Malaysia also famously rejected IMF advice and cash in 1997,
closing its markets, repegging its exchange rate, introducing
capital controls and raising state spending to fuel the economy.
 It emerged with strong growth. But it, too, differs from
Hungary, with a state oil firm that makes up for half of budget
revenues, a low level of public debt, strong currency reserves
and a string of pre-crisis budget surpluses.
 Main dangers faced by Malaysia and Turkey were linked to
their balance of payments, not the threat of a public finance
crisis faced by Hungary and other European stragglers. 
 In every one of those countries -- EU states Latvia, Romania
and Greece and non-members Serbia and Ukraine -- governments
first looked for options other than the austerity that they
eventually embraced after they were slowly shut out of debt
markets and had no other way to finance their budget deficits.
 Hungary could potentially retain investor trust as Turkey
did last year by sticking close to tight budget targets, and
economists say it does have a chance of meeting its 3.8 percent
of GDP deficit goal this year, even if it may be a close shave.
 The question is whether or how much Fidesz may loosen policy
next year in the search for stronger growth rather than aiming
for the 3 percent target agreed with the EU. That may become
clearer in a 2011 budget due around October.
 ""They'd probably have to go along with the tenets of the IMF
deal, which would be to keep the deficit below 4 percent,"" said
Tim Ash, head of CEEMEA research at the RBS. ""But it does not
seem that's what they want to do. They want a pro-growth tack.""
 
 CRUNCH COMING
 Hungary has not tapped any of its bailout aid funds since
last year and has also benefitted from improved global risk
appetite to draw solid demand at recent debt auctions.
 But, on review for a credit rating downgrade by Moody's and
on negative outlook at Standard & Poor's, it is likely to cost
the government more to fund its deficit if markets are not
convinced about its fiscal probity and it continues to shun an
IMF backstop after the October election.
 It already has 3.9 billion euros ($5.15 billion) in
government coffers, including 1.4 billion from the aid deal
earmarked for financing this year. There is another 1.0 billion
euros on loan to banks, 0.5 billion of which is available next
year.
 According to Reuters Creditviews and the Hungarian debt
agency, it needs to roll over bonds and treasury bills worth
about $8.44 billion by the end of October, including a 1 billion
euro ($1.32 billion) euro bond. That total climbs to $9.7
billion by the end of this year and to around $17.2 billion over
the next 12 months.
 The country must also start repaying its loan to the EU in
the fourth quarter of next year, with a repayment of 2 billion
euros, while the repayment of the IMF loan starts in 2012.
 If it needs a new backstop, the European Union will refuse
to negotiate a deal without the IMF, analysts said, because it
must also keep up pressure on other fiscal laggards.
 And Brussels may put pressure on Budapest ahead of Hungary's
EU presidency next year for non-compliance on issues ranging
from competition to interference with central bank independence.
 Orban is counting on a bank tax law his government hopes
will earn 187 billion forints this year and the same in 2011.
 But either way it should eventually have to return to
international markets, an unforgiving arena that will likely
drive up borrowing costs and undermine Orban's strategy, in turn
forcing Budapest back to cost cuts.
 ""I don't think the math stands up,"" said Neil Shearing, an
economist at London-based Capital Economics. ""It's just a matter
of how much collateral damage is done in the meantime.""

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2010 09:36AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Russia's main wheat export markets," Aug 6 (Reuters) - Russia has announced a temporary ban on
grain exports after the worst heat wave on record destroyed
crops and sent world wheat prices to contract highs.
The export ban could lead to the tearing-up of existing
contracts and is likely to open the way for rival suppliers to
win business in Russia's traditional markets.
 A Reuters poll of 18 analysts and traders forecast a 25
percent decline in Russia's 2010 wheat crop year-on-year to 46.5
million tonnes.
Below are details on Russia's three biggest wheat export
markets in the marketing year to June 30, 2010, followed by
wheat export data from the past two marketing years.
 
 EGYPT
 Egypt, the world's biggest wheat importer, accounted for
one-third of Russia's wheat exports in the recent marketing
year, despite a hiccup related to the quality of imports.
 Russia supplied 6.1 million tonnes of wheat to Egypt in the
12 months to June 30, up 23 percent from the previous season.
 Egypt may face a short-term supply problem after buying
360,000 tonnes of Russian wheat for shipment between Aug. 21 and
Sept. 31, plus 120,000 tonnes for Aug. 11-20 shipment.
 The General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), Egypt's
main state wheat buyer, has said it will seek to buy 60,000
tonnes a month, which could partly compensate for any shortfall
in Russian supply.
 European Union countries are first in line to fill the gap.
French exporters in particular were given a boost on July 28,
when GASC reversed a decision made in 2009 that required
exporters to load 55,000-60,000-tonne cargoes at a single port.
 The one-port requirement had forced French exporters to turn
away from their main grain terminal at Rouen. This should no
longer be a problem, provided freight costs are covered.
 
 TURKEY
 Turkey was the second-largest recipient of Russian wheat
last season, purchasing 13 percent of total Russian exports.
 Deliveries rose 8 percent year-on-year to 2.4 million
tonnes.
 Turkey, however, is usually self-sufficient in wheat and
only imported such large quantities because its crops were hit
by drought in 2007 and 2008. This year, the Turkish wheat crop
is expected to be better, reducing its need for imports.
 
 SYRIA
 Syria is the only other market to have imported more than 1
million tonnes of Russian wheat in both 2008/09 and 2009/10. It
took a 6 percent share of Russia's total exports last season.
 Russian wheat deliveries to Syria rose 3 percent last season
to 1.0 million tonnes.
 Syria, with export demands that fluctuate depending on its
own wheat harvest, is likely to require grain to make up for the
Russian shortfall, and European suppliers are best placed to
meet this demand.
 
 Russian Wheat Exports

 NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The dollar hit an eight-month

 While U.S. employers did add 71,000 private sector jobs,

action from the U.S. central bank.

 * Chance of market failure greatly reduced-FINMA
 * Several providers have decamped to Cyprus
 
 By Martin de Sa'Pinto
 ZURICH, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Several Swiss-based foreign
exchange trading platforms have shut up shop since tough new
rules introduced in 2009 obliged them to get a banking licence
and sought to bring them under regulatory scrutiny.
 Only two companies have as yet received a banking licence
from Swiss regulator FINMA since the rules were introduced, down
sharply from the end of 2008 when more than 20 forex platforms
served international traders in the $2 trillion-a-day market.
 ""We made a conscious effort to cut the number of bucket
shops in Switzerland,"" said FINMA spokesman Alain Bichsel.
 ""The forex business was in too much of a grey area, there
were always client complaints, and the risk for the client was
higher because these businesses were unlicenced.""
 Following the new requirements there are now only two
officially sanctioned independent platforms -- providers that
were not add-ons to an existing banking business -- in
Switzerland, with a third licence pending.
 Neuchatel-based MIG Bank, which sponsors the Mercedes GP
Petronas Formula One team, and Dukascopy, based in Geneva, have
both received licences, while Geneva's ACM is still waiting.
 ""The (new) measures have given more transparency to the
market and greatly reduced the chance of market failures. The
security of clients is hugely improved, and that was the target
of the regulations,"" said Bichsel.
 Client complaints included those that providers cancelled
trades, failed to return client assets on request and changed
the prices of securities after trade execution.
 Many providers acted as counterparties to clients' trades,
meaning they could make money only if clients lost. Successful
clients dented their profits, and could potentially bankrupt
their business.
 With leverage of up to a thousand times assets on offer to
clients, the potential for providers to fail was high, above all
if they were unable to lay off trades at other institutions.
 ""Tighter regulation is not a panacea, but at least traders
have someone that can back them up in case of a dispute with the
broker,"" said Francesc Riverola, chief executive of foreign
exchange trading information provider Forex Street.
 Under the new rules, institutions holding client money have
to obtain a banking licence, so must hold higher levels of
capital and ensure organisational controls such as Chinese walls
between the front and back offices.
 Sources said while some providers have now closed, many have
decamped mainly to Cyprus, where regulation has remained light
and where companies can operate tax free offshore and still
enjoy the benefits of being incorporated in the European Union.

 The U.S. Labour Department said there was a net decline of

 BRUSSELS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - A European Union financial

now fully operational, officials said on Friday.
 With financial markets restabilising after the worst of the
Greek-inspired debt crisis and Athens itself getting a positive

 The fund -- officially called the European Financial

 ""The EFSF is fully operational now and can, if necessary

 While the fund, headquartered in Luxembourg, is operational,
it has still not received a credit rating, which will be
critical to determining how much it has to pay when issuing debt
-- if it ever has to do so.
 It is expected to receive a AAA rating from the major
ratings agencies -- the same rating that the European
Commission, the EU's executive, has received for funds it raises

 An official with the EFSF said notification of the rating

 * Move follows apparent cancellation of 25 Boeing planes
 * Boeing leads 2010 order race, Airbus ahead in production

(Adds DAE declining to comment)
 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus said on Friday it
had more than doubled its tally of 2010 orders due to a bumper
Farnborough Airshow, however the pick-up was marred by $3
billion in cancelled orders from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise
(DAE).
 The Dubai-based lessor slashed an order for 100 Airbus
passenger jets by 25 percent in volume terms, shedding 18 orders
for narrow-body A320 planes and seven orders for A350-900
mid-sized jets, July figures released by the European planemaker
showed.
 The move brings to more than $8 billion the catalogue value
of DAE cancellations, totalling 50 aircraft, revealed in Airbus
and Boeing data published in the past 24 hours.
 ""I have no comment on that,"" Mohammed Al Zarooni, recently
appointed chairman of state-owned DAE, said when contacted by
telephone.
 Airbus and Boeing declined to comment on the cancellations.
 Leasing companies were hard hit during the financial crisis
though some returned with bulk orders for narrow-body planes at
last months' Farnborough trade show, which delivered
unexpectedly robust evidence of an economic turnaround.
 Excluding the effect of cancellations, Airbus said its
cumulative 2010 orders jumped to 286 planes by the end of July
from 131 planes in the first half of the year.
 Deliveries reached 298 aircraft. The EADS unit targets over
400 orders and a record 500 deliveries this year.
 There have been several specialist industry reports that
part of DAE's order portfolio would be transferred to Dubai's
Emirates airline, which ordered 30 more 777s at Farnborough.
 Al Zarooni's predecessor as DAE chairman was Sheikh Ahmed
bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman of The Emirates Group.
 On Thursday, Boeing data revealed cancellations for 25 jets
worth over a total of $5 billion at catalogue prices.
Comparisons with previously published data indicated the cuts
came from DAE. 
 DAE had ordered the 15 787-8 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ER
aircraft in 2007, at the peak of a global order boom.
 Boeing's latest backlog did not include any such wide-body
passenger jets for the leasing and repair firm. It did, however,
have 91 unfilled DAE orders for narrow-body jets and freighters.
 DAE also still has 52 Airbus A320 planes and 23 A350-900s,
designed to compete with the Boeing Dreamliner, on order with a
total list value of $10 billion at current prices.
 The Director General of Dubai's Department of Finance,
Abdelrahman al Saleh, said recently DAE was in negotiations with
Boeing and Airbus on its total of some 220 plane orders.
 Airbus Sales Chief John Leahy said at Farnborough that it
was ""no secret"" that DAE was facing disruption over its orders.
 After adjusting for total cancellations in the past month,
Airbus reported a net total of 245 new orders in the first seven
months of the year, up from 117 by the end of June.
 The data leaves Boeing ahead of its rival in the race for
2010 orders as the industry exits recession, though it still
ranks in second place behind Airbus in terms of production.
 Boeing said it had received total orders for 319 planes
between January and July, and a net total of 255 planes after
adjusting for cancellations. The net orders include 229
narrow-body Boeing 737 short-haul and medium-haul planes.

executive of the fund, said in a statement.
 ""The EFSF is fully operational now and can, if necessary
issue bonds with the help of the German Debt Office, which would
be guaranteed by the euro area member states.""
 While the fund, headquartered in Luxembourg, is operational,
it has still not received a credit rating, which will be
critical to determining how much it has to pay when issuing debt
-- if it ever has to do so.
 It is expected to receive a AAA rating from the major
ratings agencies -- the same rating that the European
Commission, the EU's executive, has received for funds it raises
with the backing of all EU member states.
 An official with the EFSF said it hoped to receive
notification of its credit rating in the coming days.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2010 07:48AM ET</span>",China says to maintain trade cooperation with Iran," BEIJING, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang
told the visiting Iranian oil minister on Friday that Beijing
would maintain cooperation with Tehran on existing projects,
after the United States called on Beijing to observe sanctions.
 ""Iran is an important trade partner of China's in western
Asia and North Africa and one of the country's main oil
suppliers. Bilateral economic and trade cooperation has
achieved fruitful results,"" state television paraphrased Li as
telling minister Massoud Mirkazemi.
 ""China is willing to work hard with Iran, continue to push
mutual political trust, and maintain communication, dialogue
and coordination on important international issues, to maintain
regional and global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Li added.
 ""The key point is to solidly push forward existing
cooperative projects, to ensure they are put into effect
smoothly, to deepen bilateral pragmatic cooperation and promote
the continued development of bilateral ties,"" he added.
 State television showed pictures of the meeting, in the
Communist Party's headquarters in central Beijing, on its main
evening news.
 Mirkazemi said he hoped that ""both sides would create
conditions to push forward existing projects"", the brief report
added, without elaborating.
 The minister is in Beijing for talks with Chinese energy
executives. He has not made any public comments.
 China has already pushed back at U.S. pressure on its
business and oil trade with Iran in comments published earlier
this week, saying Chinese trade dealings with Iran should not
be criticised.
 The government was responding to comments by Robert
Einhorn, special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control
at the U.S. State Department, who said on Monday that China
should observe sanctions against Iran aimed at forcing it to
curtail its nuclear ambitions.
 Western governments have pressed China to loosen its energy
and economic ties with Iran, which they see as shielding Iran
from international pressure.
 Iran is a major supplier of crude oil to China, the world's
second-biggest consumer of oil after the United States.
 The United States has urged China to tap other suppliers,
but China has condemned unilateral U.S. and E.U. sanctions
aimed at Iran's energy sector.
 China has backed U.N. Security Council resolutions pressing
Iran to abandon disputed nuclear activities, which Western
governments say are aimed at giving Iran the means to make
nuclear weapons. Iran disputes that.
 In the first half of 2010, Iran held its place as China's
third biggest supplier of crude with shipments of 9 million
tonnes of oil, putting it behind Saudi Arabia and Angola,
according to Chinese customs data.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2010 07:12AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-SAfrica state workers set Aug 10 for one-day strike," * Govt, unions representing about 1 million workers in talks
 * Unions threaten prolonged strike
 * ANC under pressure to reach deal

(Updates with COSATU statement, analyst quotes)
 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 6 (Reuters) - More than a million South
African public sector workers plan to strike on Tuesday and
demonstrate throughout the country in what could be a prelude to
prolonged industrial action in Africa's largest economy.
 The government raised its pay offer to civil servants on
Thursday to try to avert the strike, but it was quickly rejected
by the unions.
 ""More than 1.3 million public servants will on Tuesday take
part in marches and demonstrations right through the country
leading to a total shutdown of the public service,"" the largest
umbrella labour group, COSATU, said in a statement.
 ""There is a very strong possibility that by the end of the
week, we will be embarking on a larger strike,"" said Sizwe
Pamla, spokesman for NEHAWU, one of the COSATU unions.
 Analysts expect more sparring in the coming days but say a
deal tilted in the unions' favour will be reached to head off a
repeat of the mass action by civil servants three years ago that
damaged the economy.
 Workers who have threatened to strike include customs and
immigration officers, police, health care staff and teachers.
 The ruling African National Congress has a longstanding
alliance with organised labour forged in their struggle to end
apartheid and has almost always bowed to union demands.
 President Jacob Zuma, who relied on organised labour to rise
to the country's highest post, will be under pressure to find a
solution that satisfies unions or he could face a backlash at
the ANC's policy-setting meeting in September, which is one of
the party's most important events.
 
 POLITICAL SOLUTION?
 Sakhela Buhlungu, an expert on organised labour at the
University of Johannesburg, said the government could try to
reach a political solution by talking to union leaders.
 He said the government had misread the amount of anger among
unions who feel Zuma has not done enough to help them.
 ""The strike will force them (the government) to scratch
around and find money elsewhere,"" Buhlungu said.
 The Public Service Ministry had said in a statement it was
prepared to increase salaries by 7 percent, after previously
offering 6.5 percent.
 Union officials said the government had increased its offer
of a 630 rand ($87) monthly housing allowance by 20 rand.
 Unions have been demanding a wage increase of 8.6 percent --
double the current rate of inflation -- and a housing allowance
of 1,000 rand, which would put pressure on the state budget.
 Unions need to convince the public that civil servants are
underpaid and deserve the raises or risk losing support from
taxpayers who feel the money they pay government for services is
being wasted on needless salary hikes, analysts say.
 The government says the combined demands amount to a rise of
9 percent and make it all but impossible to fulfil a commitment
to bring the budget deficit down from 6.7 percent of gross
domestic product.
 Spending on personnel is the largest sector of the budget.

* UK sitting on 3.5 bln sterling paper profit on RBS, Lloyds
 * Return to profit lifts RBS, Lloyds shrs above UK's buy-in
 * UK set for 19 bln sterling profit on bailouts- CEBR
 By Steve Slater
 LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - British taxpayers are sitting on a
3.5 billion pound ($5.6 billion) paper profit on stakes in Royal
Bank of Scotland and Lloyds after both swung back to profit,
driving their shares higher.
 Britain's profit could be more than five times that amount
-- potentially bringing in much needed income for the
cash-strapped UK government. 
 ""It now looks like the government's huge bank bailout, far
from costing the taxpayer money, will yield a 19 billion pound
profit,"" said Doug McWilliams from the Center for Economics and
Business Research.
 His estimate was based on shares rising in line with nominal
GDP and the stakes being sold over the next five years. If RBS
and Lloyds extend their revival the profit will be even higher
from the much criticised bailouts.
 Britain pumped 66 billion pounds into the pair in 2008 and
2009 to hold an 83 percent stake in RBS and 41 percent of
Lloyds.
 RBS shares rose 2.4 percent to 53.3 pence on Friday after it
said it had swung to a 1.6 billion pound operating profit in the
first half, from a 3.4 billion pound loss a year ago.
 The government paid an average of 50.2 pence for each of its
90.6 billion RBS shares during a series of transactions to
rescue it from collapse, leaving the state with a current 2.7
billion pound paper profit.
 Lloyds shares have jumped 10 percent this week to 76.2
pence, above the government's average purchase price of 73.6
pence for its 27.6 billion shares. Lloyds halted two years of
losses with a first-half profit of 1.6 billion pounds.
However, it is likely to be some time before UK Financial
Investments, the body that holds the stakes, will start
realising a profit. 
 Britain has appointed a Banking Commission to investigate
competition in the industry and consider splitting retail and
investment banking, and UKFI is not expected to sell its RBS or
Lloyds holdings until the outcome is clearer next year.
 ""As far as we're concerned they can start reducing tomorrow
morning,"" Stephen Hester, RBS chief executive, said on Friday,
but added the Banking Commission inquiry ""may put some
constraints on timing.""
 ""We are trying as hard as we can to put them in a position
where they can profitably sell. We hope they will, we think it's
to everyone's advantage -- RBS will see progress as we wind back
the state support and the government will see a closing of its
budget deficit, which is highly desirable for all the reasons we
know about,"" he told reporters on a conference call.
 The government also fully owns smaller lenders Northern Rock
and Bradford & Bingley. Their performances have also improved
and could see the ""good bank"" part of Northern Rock sold before
the RBS and Lloyds stakes.

 * Weak reading may spur speculation of more Fed stimulus
 
(Adds comment, details, updates prices)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled near a 3
1/2-month low versus a currency basket on Friday as investors
braced for U.S. data expected to show a fall in jobs for a
second month, underlining the fragility of the labour market.
 Currencies were generally little changed as traders steered
clear of big positions before the much-anticipated data, leaving
the dollar stranded close to a three-month low against the euro
and an eight-month trough versus the yen hit earlier this week.
 An unexpected rise in weekly U.S. jobless claims on Thursday
fuelled speculation that payrolls may be weak, and analysts said
dollar risks were skewed to the downside as Friday's data was
expected to show the economic recovery was losing steam.
""We expect a number slightly better than consensus, but it's
questionable whether this will help the dollar as interest rates
are so low and we have a divergence of softer U.S. economic data
and stronger European data,"" said Marcus Hettinger, global
currency strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 Forecasts are for a loss of 65,000 jobs in July. Data on
Thursday showed new claims for jobless benefits rose by 19,000
last week, although these figures will have no bearing on
Friday's data.
 Hettinger said dollar weakness would continue in the run-up
to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, as a spate of
weak economic data has strengthened the argument the central
bank may have to offer further stimulus to boost the economy.
 Some analysts said they would be watching the private
payrolls growth component as leading data has been consistent
with a moderate rise.
 If that growth averages around 100,000, around where it has
been at in the first half, analysts at Mitsubishi UFJ said the
Fed is unlikely to alter its growth outlook and, ultimately, its
monetary policy stance to keep rates low for now.
 ""In those circumstances, today's NFP report could prove
supportive for the dollar as it should help pare near-term Fed
monetary easing expetations,"" they said in a note.
 Speculation the Fed may buy more bonds to support the
economy drove the two-year Treasury yield to a record low this
week. Some say this has dimmed the appeal of short-term U.S.
debt among overseas investors, knocking the dollar.
 By 0926 GMT, the euro was flat on the day at $1.3180, but
hovered in range of $1.3262 hit earlier this week, its strongest
since early May. The single currency was parked just below
$1.3200 options due to expire later in the day.
 Technical analysts cited near-term resistance at
$1.3265/1.3280, lows hit in March and April, while support was
seen at $1.3125, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
euro's fall from November 2009-June 2010. The single currency
has been hovering above this level for the past week.
 Some analysts said the euro had room to gain if German
industrial output data due this morning come in strong. A string
of solid German numbers has supported the view that the euro
zone economy is improving faster than the U.S.
 
 DOLLAR/YEN PRESSURE
 The dollar index was flat at 80.849 hovering near 80.469 hit
on Monday, its lowest since April. While it held near its
200-day moving average at 80.792 on Friday, a weekly close below
that may spell more losses for the dollar, analysts say.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 86.00 yen,
treading above 85.32 yen hit on Wednesday and where technical
analysts saw some support. A fall under that level would mark
the dollar's weakest since November 2009.
 Traders said a sizable volume of knockout option positions
below 85 yen suggested that the dollar's fall could become more
volatile if it does step into those price levels.
 A breach of 85.00 yen is seen cranking up rhetoric by
Japanese authorities that the yen is too strong, but many market
players think Tokyo is unlikely to pull the trigger at this
time.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2010 05:52AM ET</span>",North Africa crops in line with forecast declines," * Morocco, Algeria harvests in line with forecasts 
 * Tunisian crop smaller than expected: farm union 
 * Cereals output in region pushed down by poor weather 
 
 ALGIERS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Grain harvests in Morocco and
Algeria, north Africa's main cereal producers, are broadly in
line with forecast declines, while Tunisia's crop is smaller
than predicted, officials and farming groups said.
 The hot weather which damaged crops in Russia and parts of
Western Europe, driving international grain prices to two-year
highs, has not moved south of the Mediterranean, leaving mild
conditions for the end of the growing season.
 The harvest has been gathered in most places in north
Africa, where some countries are among the world's biggest grain
importers.
 Farming officials have blamed the reduced output versus last
year on poor weather earlier in the season.
 Morocco is expected to produce 8 million tonnes of grain,
down from last year's 10.2 million, and Algeria's harvest will
be about 4.5 million tonnes, against a record 6.1 million tonnes
last year, according to local estimates.
 The crop in Morocco, the region's biggest producer, will be
in line with an Agriculture Ministry forecast made in April, the
head of the country's main farming lobby told Reuters.
 ""The harvest outcome is good, because it came in higher than
the average of the past five years,"" said Bouchta Bousouf,
chairman of the Moroccan Federation of Farming Chambers.
 ""The quality of the harvest is also good. We can not say
very good, because the previous harvest was really excellent in
terms of quality,"" he said.
 
 CROP BREAKDOWN
 Moroccan state grain import agency ONICL released figures
forecasting the harvest would comprise 3.8 million tonnes of
soft wheat, 1.7 million tonnes of durum wheat and 2.5 million
tonnes of barley.
 However, it was not clear whether those figures were based
on fresh data or on an older forecast.
 In Algeria, Agriculture Minister Rachid Benaissa gave the
4.5 million tonne forecast last month, saying soft wheat and
barley crops would be smaller but the durum wheat harvest would
be good.
 Agriculture Ministry sources earlier told Reuters the
harvest would be between 5 million and 5.5 million tonnes.
Farming sector sources said irregular rains at the start of the
year and flooding in June affected the size of the crop.
 Tunisia had been forecasting a cereals harvest of 1.6
million tonnes, down from 2.5 million the year before, but Monji
Chrif, an official with the Agriculture Union, revised his
prediction down this week to between 1.1 million and 1.2 million
tonnes.
 He did not cite a reason, but officials previously said poor
rains had affected the crop.
 Libya, which has the region's smallest population, said in
June the harvest was 300,000 tonnes. Libya harvests its crop
earlier than Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia because its farmland
lies further south.
 None of the four countries has so far given any indication
of how they will adjust import schedules after the Russian
drought drove up international prices and interrupted exports of
Russian grain.

 * Dollar falling broadly due to worries on U.S. economy
 * BOJ to meet Aug 9-10, policy move not ruled out
(Adds quotes, business lobby interview)
 By Stanley White and Shigeo Kodama
 TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan could ease policy
further should the dollar break below 80 yen by extending the
size or duration of a fixed interest rate funding operation,
Teizo Taya, a former BOJ board member, said on Friday.
 Japan's finance ministry is unlikely to intervene unless the
dollar moves 3 to 4 yen in one day, Taya told Reuters in an
interview.
 Speculation has intensified over whether authorities may
consider intervention or if the central bank might relax its
already ultra-loose monetary policy to curb the yen's rise.
 ""Exports are already slowing, so if the yen rises further,
production slows and corporate earnings fall, then it's possible
the BOJ could to ease further,"" he said.
 ""For the BOJ, the level of dollar/yen would be important. If
dollar/yen breaks 80 there would be a lot of complaints from
businesses and the BOJ might respond. The BOJ might expand the
amount of the fixed-interest rate operation. The duration could
be expanded to six months, or maybe even one year to have more
impact.""
 Policy-makers are worried that the yen's strength could
undermine Japanese exports, which have led the economy out of
the global downturn, and add to deflationary pressures following
16 straight months of falling consumer prices.
 But businesses have not complained much about the strong yen
so far, suggesting that as long as its rise is gradual the pain
will be limited.
 The head of a Japanese business lobby told Reuters on Friday
the government should not intervene in currency markets despite
a firmer yen.
 Japan has not conducted currency intervention since 2004 and
some economists say it would be hard to resume intervention at a
time when other Group of Seven countries are pushing China to
allow the yuan to rise.
 Since Japan's government can do little to stop the rising
yen beyond actual intervention, pressure is likely to fall on
the BOJ to take some measures to stem the currency's gain.
 The dollar traded at 86.08 yen on Friday, up 0.3 percent on
the day and more than 1 yen above its November low of 84.82 yen,
a break of which would take it to a 15-year low.
 The BOJ is seen unlikely to change policy at a two-day
policy meeting ending on Aug. 10. But there is a possibility the
BOJ could take minor steps if the yen shoots up.
 Analysts believe a BOJ decision in December, under
government pressure, to set up a fixed-rate bank funding scheme
was designed to help cool the yen, suggesting further central
bank action could be considered.
 The BOJ scheme launched in December funnels up to 20
trillion yen ($233.1 billion) in three-month loans to banks at
0.1 percent interest.
 By increasing the amount or extending the duration of the
loans to six months the central bank could push down interbank
lending rates and weaken the yen, economists have said.
 The BOJ's benchmark policy rate is also set at 0.1 percent,
and with rates already near zero, many board members feel there
is very little the BOJ can still do to help the economy.
 Japanese authorities have not intervened in currency markets
since March 2004, when their 15-month yen selling spree came to
an end. During that period they sold 35 trillion yen to curb the
yen's strength and support the country's exporting industries.
 ""There could be intervention if dollar/yen moved 3 or 4 yen
in one day. Anything less and I think there's no chance of
intervention,"" Taya said.
 Sentiment for the dollar has taken a hit recently due to a
string of weak economic data and speculation that the Federal
Reserve could take further easing measures as early as a meeting
on Aug. 10.
 Traders are bracing for further declines in the dollar
should U.S. non-farm payrolls data due at 1230 GMT on Friday
show companies shed more workers than expected.
 Taya, who left the BOJ board in 2004 after serving for five
years, is currently an adviser at the Daiwa Institute of
Research in Tokyo.

 By Kiyoshi Takenaka
 TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Japan's government should not
intervene in foreign exchange markets to curtail the yen's
strength even as the currency's appreciation threatens to erode
Japanese exporters' profits, the head of a business lobby said.
 Masamitsu Sakurai, chairman of the Japan Association of
Corporate Executives, also said the nation's corporate tax rate
-- about 40 percent and the highest among G7 countries -- should
be cut to 25 percent to help Japanese firms compete globally.
 The yen has soared against the dollar and is nearing a
15-year high, a big worry for exporters like automakers and
electronics makers because it makes their products more expensive
overseas and eats into profits when repatriated.
 ""Companies on average are assuming 90 yen a dollar. The
dollar below 90 yen leads to considerably lower profits than
their forecasts,"" Sakurai told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
 ""But market intervention is internationally frowned upon.
That's not something an advanced nation should do to buttress the
economy,"" said Sakurai, who is also chairman of copier and
printer maker Ricoh Co Ltd.
 The dollar fell to as low as 85.32 yen this week and was
trading around 86 yen on Friday. A break of its November low of
84.82 yen would take it to its lowest since 1995.
 Japanese authorities have not intervened in foreign exchange
markets since March 2004, when their 15-month yen selling spree
to curb the yen's strength and support the country's exporting
industries came to an end.
 In contrast, currency dealers said on Friday that South
Korean authorities were seen buying dollars to control the won's
advance. Auto and electronics makers in South Korea and Japan
compete head-on in global markets.
 ""A strong yen hurts especially because Japanese companies
have just changed gears and started taking aggressive measures in
capital spending and M&As after having streamlined operations
following the Lehman shock,"" Sakurai said.
 HEAVILY HANDICAPPED
 Sakurai also said the corporate tax rate should eventually be
lowered to around 25 percent to put Japan's exporters on a level
playing field with overseas rivals, though it first should be cut
to 35 percent.
 ""The corporate sector plays a major role in driving economic
growth. For companies to take advantage of overseas demand, they
need to be globally competitive. But we are heavily handicapped,""
he said.
 South Korea had a corporate tax rate of 24.2 percent, while
that of Germany, home to some of Japanese carmakers' biggest
rivals, was at 30.2 percent as of last year, according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 Sakurai also said Japan's ruling Democratic Party should not
blindly stick to its campaign promises, and that flexibly
reviewing campaign pledges would not necessarily mean it was
breaking promises.
 Before last year's lower house election that swept the
Democrats to power, the party pledged to put more money into the
hands of consumers by paying benefits to families with children,
eliminating highway tolls, and other steps.
 But the feasibility of paying for such measures is being
questioned as the government struggles to rein in a huge public
debt that is nearly twice the size of the $5 trillion economy --
the worst ratio among G7 countries.
 ""(Prime Minister Naoto) Kan's government puts high priority
on fiscal reforms ... They need to take another look at their
manifesto to align it with that priority,"" Sakurai said.
 ""Fine-tuning campaign promises is nothing to be ashamed of.
Just keeping pledges and not reviewing them, that would be
something to be ashamed of,"" he said.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2010 11:44PM ET</span>",FOREX-Dollar stuck near 3-½ mth low as jobs data looms," * Dollar index near 3-½ month low, yen nears 15-year high
 * Dollar bears see payrolls adding to economy worries
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive near
a 3-½ month low against a basket of currencies after weak U.S.
jobless claims figures heightened worries that Friday's payroll
data could paint a bleak picture of the U.S. economic recovery.
 A weak reading could fuel talk that the Federal Reserve may
consider additional easing steps as early as next week, which
could put pressure on the dollar particularly against the yen,
given the pair's recent strong correlation with U.S. Treasury
yields.
 ""Unless employment improves, housing demand won't improve and
consumption won't grow. The U.S. economy could hit a lull,"" said
Kakuya Kojoh, head of the securities department at Nissan Century
Securities.
 Against the Japanese currency, the dollar traded at 85.94
yen, little changed on the day and one yen above its November low
of 84.82 yen, a break of which would take it to a 15-year low.
 ""The market is focusing on the outlook for the U.S. economy.
If the dollar breaks below the November low, it could enter a
whole new world,"" said Minoru Shioiri, chief manager of forex
trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
 Traders said there was a sizable volume of knockout option
positions below 85 yen, which suggests that the dollar's fall
could become more volatile if it does step into those price
levels.
 While further yen gains could stir talk of yen-selling
intervention by Japanese authorities, many market players think
Tokyo is unlikely to pull the trigger at this time.
 For now the dollar has some support at 85.32 yen, its low on
Wednesday.
 The euro fetched $1.3180, keeping much of Thursday's gain of
about 0.3 percent. Now not far off its three-month high of
$1.3262 hit earlier in the week, the currency has immediate
support around $1.3105-25, a previous resistance area.
 U.S. JOBS IN FOCUS
 The dollar index stood at 80.81, little changed from late
U.S. trade and near its Tuesday low of 80.469, its lowest since
mid-April.
 The index, however, appears to have some support around
80.50, having managed to hold near its 200-day moving average,
which stood at 80.792 on Friday.
 Its 14-day relative strength index is below 30, indicating a
heavily oversold position.
 Some traders therefore see a chance of a rebound in the
dollar if the payrolls data, due at 1230 GMT, provides a positive
surprise or even comes close to market expectations.
 Economists forecast a total job loss of 65,000 in July,
following a fall of 125,000 in June.
 On Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the
number of Americans filing for initial jobless benefits rose
19,000 to 479,000 last week, the highest level since early April,
despite economists' forecast for a fall.
 The Australian dollar erased earlier losses, after the
Reserve Bank of Australia stuck to its forecasts for domestic
growth to accelerate to 4 percent over the next two years in its
quarterly statement.
 The Aussie changed hands at $0.9150, nearly flat on the day,
and 0.4 percent below its three-month peak of $0.9184 hit on
Wednesday.
 The Australian currency stayed near a 2-½ month high
against the New Zealand dollar, which continued to suffer from
Thursday's poor New Zealand job data.
 The Aussie fetched NZ$1.2563, after having risen to around
NZ$1.2590 on Thursday.
 The kiwi slipped 0.3 percent against the U.S. dollar to
$0.7275.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar backed off a
13-week high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, with
volatility noted from comments by the country's finance
minister and ahead of North American job reports.
 In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Finance Minister
Jim Flaherty said the rise in Canada's currency ""makes sense""
because investors are snapping up the country's assets and the
economy is growing nicely. [ID:nN05141152]
 The comments contrasted with concerns he expressed last
year about the currency's sharp rise, which was seen at the
time as a warning shot against speculators.
 The finance minister also did not appear overly worried
that the currency was nearing parity with the U.S. dollar, a
level it has not seen since April.
 ""There was a period a year ago when there was a great deal
of hand-wringing over Canadian dollar strength and that really
has abated as Canada has emerged as one of the stronger
economies in the world,"" said Eric Lascelles, chief Canada
macro strategist at TD Securities.
 ""I think the market will probably feel a little bit more
comfortable in the sort of range it's in right now and will not
feel quite as pressing a need to shift back to a C$1.05 or
C$1.06 level.""
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0166 to the
U.S. dollar, or 98.37 U.S. cents, easing from a 13-week high
hit earlier at C$1.0107 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.94 U.S.
cents. But the finish was still up from C$1.0176 to the U.S.
dollar, or 98.27 U.S. cents, at Wednesday's close.
 Flaherty's comments had little lasting impact on the
currency market, as investors were more focused on Friday's
employment reports from Canada and the United States. The data
will help determine the health of two closely linked economies,
both of which have shown varying degrees of recovery.

 In Canada, forecasters are expecting a gain of 15,000 jobs
and a steady unemployment rate at 7.9 percent. [ID:nN30270191]
 Possible merger and acquisition-related flows also helped
the currency hit its session high and edge closer to parity,
based on talk of a possible $20 billion-$25 billion deal in the
oil and gas sector.

 The parity view is beginning to gather a little more steam
again, just as commodity prices are also finding some
strength.
 ""It wouldn't be a big stretch to think that we'll just get
there at some point in time. It's all the commodity pricing.
You've seen that as of late with the recent tick up of the base
metals and oil at the same time the loonie has caught a bid,""
Paul Taylor, chief investment officer at BMO Harris Investment
Management Inc, said in a quarterly investment outlook.
 BONDS RISE STRONGLY
 Canadian government bond prices jumped along with U.S.
Treasury issues after an unexpected rise in U.S. weekly claims
for jobless benefits that boosted concern that Friday's U.S.
employment report could be weak.
 Lascelles said that, even though this week's jobless claims
data will not figure into the July U.S. jobs report, the market
is already sensitive to slower growth prospects.
 The two-year bond  was up 5 Canadian cents to
yield 1.514 percent, while the 10-year bond  was up
37 Canadian cents to yield 3.124 percent.

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks
dropped on Thursday after an unexpected rise in weekly U.S.
jobless claims underscored the weakening economy, and the euro
ended slightly stronger against the dollar a day ahead of the
U.S. government's monthly payrolls report.
 The number of Americans making new claims for jobless
benefits rose by 19,000 to 479,000 in the week ended July 31 --
the highest level in nearly four months. For details, see
[ID:nN05245807] The news, coming a day ahead of the U.S.
government's closely watched monthly payrolls report, put
investors on edge, as stubbornly high unemployment has fueled
concerns on sustainable global growth.
 Treasuries prices rose on a safety bid as investors braced
for the employment report, and oil and commodity prices slipped
on slowing demand. Copper prices were also hit by worries about
the outlook for the real estate market in China, the world's
largest consumer of the industrial metal.
 China's banking regulator ordered lenders to test the
impact of a fall in house prices of up to 50 percent in key
cities where prices have risen sharply, banking and regulatory
sources said on Thursday. [ID:nTOE674014]
 But the U.S. labor market stole the spotlight on Thursday
following the surprisingly weak jobless claims report.
 ""The claims data today was miserable and obviously it has a
negative implication for the non-farm number tomorrow,"" said
Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated
Investors, in New York.
 ""But the important thing tomorrow is going to be what are
the organic, permanent underlying trends in private payroll,
manufacturing payrolls, household survey, etc.""
 Economists polled by Reuters expect Friday's U.S. Labor
Department report to show a drop of 65,000 in non-farm payrolls
in July, hurt by the unwinding of the government's hiring for
the census. Private employers are expected to have added 90,000
jobs. [ECI/US]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 5.45
points, or 0.05 percent, at 10,674.98. The benchmark Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 1.43 points, or 0.13 percent,
at 1,125.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 10.51
points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,293.06.
 Weakness in consumer spending trends also stayed in focus
as the 28 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters reported July
same-store sales that rose only 2.9 percent -- falling short of
analysts' expectations for a 3.1 percent gain. [ID:nN05219163]
 Shares of department store operator JC Penney Co Inc
 fell 7.7 percent to $22.12 while youth-oriented apparel
chain Aeropostale Inc  slumped 5.7 percent to $25.88.
 ""The sales data was unimpressive and points to a consumer
who is tapped out,"" said Joseph Battipaglia, market strategist
at Stifel Nicolaus in Yardley, Pennsylvania. ""If payrolls don't
increase and incomes don't rise, it's going to be a bleak
picture for retailers for the rest of the year.""
 Global equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> were up slightly, climbing 0.14 percent,
while the Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> rose
0.10 percent.
 European shares closed lower. The pan-European FTSEurofirst
300 index of top shares <.FTEU3> shed 0.23 percent to 1,068.58
points, slipping from three-month highs hit earlier in the
session.
 Higher-than-expected profits from Barclays  and
Commerzbank  failed to dispel concerns over the
underlying health of Europe's top banks. The lenders shed 4.7
and 2.2 percent, respectively.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 1.7 percent, helped by top
carmaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, which reported its
best operating profit in two years.
 SUMMER LOVE FOR EURO
 After a volatile session, the euro ended the day slightly
stronger against the dollar as investors positioned themselves
ahead of the U.S. payrolls report.
 The currency got a nice boost earlier Thursday by solid
German industrial data and signs that Spain and Greece were
making progress in trimming budget deficits.
 The euro  was up 0.21 percent at $1.3186. Earlier it
rose to $1.3234 after the U.S. jobless claims data.
 A strong debt auction in Spain and a vote of confidence
from the International Monetary fund in Greece's efforts to cut
the deficit also boosted euro buying during European trade. For
more see [[ID:nLAG006364]] and [ID:nLDE6740CM]
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros in three-year bonds at a lower
yield than a previous auction in June, suggesting solid demand
as it copes with fiscal problems. [ID:nLDE6740CM]
 Earlier, both the Bank of England and the European Central
Bank kept interest rates unchanged, as expected.
 The ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said third-quarter
euro zone economic data has come in stronger than expected so
far but the central bank still expects the bloc's economic
recovery to be moderate and uneven. [ID:nLDE67315T]
 Conversely, the dollar was down against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
dipping 0.16 percent at 80.766 from a previous session close of
80.892. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down
0.57 percent at 85.79 from a previous session close of 86.280.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
13/32, with the yield at 2.91 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  was up 2/32, with the yield at 0.53 percent.
The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up 15/32, with
the yield at 4.06 percent.
In energy and commodities prices, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 fell 43 cents, or 0.52 percent, to $82.04 per barrel,
but spot gold prices  rose 40 cents, or 0.03 percent, to
$1195.60. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB> was down 1.31
points, or 0.47 percent, at 277.67.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The dollar edged lower versus
the euro on Thursday, as investors avoided building large
positions a day ahead of a U.S. payrolls report that markets
hope will offer fresh insight on the state of the economy.
 After selling the dollar aggressively earlier this week,
investors were unwinding some bets against it Thursday in case
the government's monthly payrolls report on Friday shows a
surprisingly strong jobs gain.
 A strong payrolls report would reduce the chances of the
Federal Reserve mentioning additional stimulus in its policy
statement after its upcoming meeting on Tuesday and could help
create a near-term top in euro/dollar after a recent rally in
the single currency, analysts said.
 ""Traders may be anxious to take... positions ahead of
payrolls,"" said Jessica Hoversen, a fixed-income and forex
analyst at MF Global Inc in Chicago.
 ""If payrolls are poor, then trepidations may increase over
the possibility of the Fed engaging in more quantitative
easing,"" she said.
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect the United States lost
65,000 jobs in July, but added 90,000 in the private sector. An
independent report from payrolls processor ADP Employment
Services earlier this week said the private sector added 43,000

 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro was up 0.1

 Strong German industrial data and signs that Spain and
Greece were making progress in trimming budget deficits earlier
lifted the euro.
 A smooth debt auction in Spain and a vote of confidence

 Both countries were at the forefront of a euro zone debt
crisis that drove the currency below $1.19 in June, its worst

flat at $1.5881 after hitting a six-month high above $1.59 this
week.

 Recent signs of slower U.S. growth have hobbled the dollar;
since July, it has lost about 6 percent against a basket of
major currencies. It fell this week along with short-dated U.S.
Treasury yields amid speculation the Fed could revive Treasury
and mortgage bond purchase to boost growth.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The dollar was little changed
against the euro on Thursday, as investors avoided building
large positions a day ahead of a U.S. payrolls report that
markets hope will offer fresh insight on the state of the
economy.
 Strong German industrial data and signs that Spain and
Greece were making progress in trimming budget deficits earlier
lifted the euro, as did data showing U.S. initial jobless
claims unexpectedly rose in the latest week.
 But after selling the dollar aggressively earlier this
week, investors were unwinding some bets against it Thursday in
case the government's monthly payrolls report on Friday shows a
surprisingly strong jobs gain.
 ""Traders may be anxious to take on bullish dollar positions
ahead of payrolls,"" said Jessica Hoversen, a fixed-income and
forex analyst at MF Global Inc in Chicago.
 ""If payrolls are poor, then trepidations may increase over
the possibility of the Federal Reserve engaging in more
quantitative easing,"" she said.
 On the other hand, a strong payrolls report would reduce
the chances of the Fed mentioning additional stimulus and could
help create a near-term top in euro/dollar, according to
Hoversen.
 In afternoon trading in New York, the euro was flat at
$1.3150. Earlier it rose to $1.3234 after the U.S. Labor
Department reported a surprise 19,000 rise in the number of
Americans filing for initial jobless benefits last week.
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect the United States lost
65,000 jobs in July, but added 90,000 in the private sector. An
independent report from payrolls processor ADP Employment
Services earlier this week said the private sector added 43,000
jobs in July.
 A strong debt auction in Spain and a vote of confidence
from the International Monetary Fund in Greece's efforts to cut
the deficit also boosted euro buying during European trade.
 Both countries were at the forefront of a euro zone debt
crisis that drove the currency below $1.19 in June, its worst

 By Jack Reerink and Jeffrey Hodgson
 OTTAWA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The rise in Canada's currency
""makes sense"" because investors are snapping up the country's
assets and the economy is growing nicely, Canadian Finance
Minister Jim Flaherty said on Thursday.
 It's a different world from the heady days of 2007, when
the Canadian dollar zoomed up to a high near US$1.10, Flaherty
said. Then, speculators were at the heart of the rise, he said,
while this time he credits the strong economy.
 ""There's more demand for Canadian investments. So the
upward pressure on the dollar to me makes sense,"" said
Flaherty, who previously voiced concerns about the ""loonie's""
rapid rise.
 The currency was trading near C$1.02 to the U.S. dollar, or
just above 98 U.S. cents on Thursday.
 ""It would have to go significantly above parity. And that
would be a concern for Canadian business, and therefore a
concern of mine,"" Flaherty told Reuters in his Parliament Hill
office.
 Flaherty, the ""eminence grise"" among finance ministers of
the Group of Seven big economies with four years on the job,
also is focused on prodding China and other Asian economies to
let their currencies rise -- a perennial discussion point at
finance minister meetings.
 ""We feel that there's room to move ... more flexibility in
the Asian currencies,"" said Flaherty, who treated his G7
colleagues to a dog sled ride and meal of seal meat at a
February conference in Canada's Far North.
 ""At the same time, I'm pleased to see a restoration of a
degree of flexibility with the Chinese currency,"" he said.
""We'll continue to press on the subject.""
 FOCUS ON ASIA
 Flaherty's Asia focus fits with Canada's drive to stimulate
trade with emerging markets, particularly resource-hungry
China.
 ""We know that the world trade picture is changing. You can
see it in the countries that sit around the table at the G20
summits,"" he said, his voice almost drowned out by the
stand-alone air-conditioning unit cooling his office in the
Gothic Revival building.
 The share of Canada's exports going to the United States
has steadily declined in the past decade, but still stands at
three-quarters. Flaherty sees it going down to as little as 60
percent in the next five to 10 years on more Asia business and
a possible trade deal with the European Union.
 All the same, the state of the U.S. economy is always front
of mind. And Flaherty, who mostly uses job figures and consumer
confidence to gauge economic conditions, is pretty upbeat.
 ""My two significant worries about the American economy are
the relative weakness of the job recovery ... and weak U.S.
consumer confidence,"" he said, adding the risk of the U.S.
economy sliding back into recession is ""modest""
 ""The more likely course is a modest gradual recovery,"" said
Flaherty, who studied at Princeton University before getting
his law degree in Canada.
 The ""track is good"" for Flaherty's own budget, due early
next year, as analysts are ratcheting up expectations of
economic growth to 3.5 percent this year. One issue clouding
the picture: how to account for payments to provinces adopting
the harmonized sales tax, or HST, which combines federal and
provincial sales taxes rather than collect them separately.
 Number crunchers are now figuring out whether to take the
hit in one go or spread it out over several years, Flaherty
said, adding: ""We don't have fun with figures here.""
 MINORITIES SHORT-LIVED
 Budget time is tricky, especially for Canada's minority
Conservative government. History shows minority governments
have averaged a life span of around two and a half years and
typically fell over a budget vote, Flaherty noted.
 Flaherty, a former personal injury lawyer of Irish-Canadian
descent, stayed clear of predicting when the current government
might face a new election, saying there are just too many
variables in politics.
 Framed by a painting of Thomas D'Arcy McGee, an Irish
nationalist and one of the fathers of the Canadian
Confederation, Flaherty credits his law background and
litigation experience for the ability to thoroughly analyze a
problem and quickly ""getting to the point.""
 He needs both to hammer out a global bank regulation deal
before the next Group of 20 summit in November in Seoul. The
key issue is how banks should define their capital, Flaherty
said. Can they count residential mortgages? How about equity
stakes like Toronto-Dominion Bank's  stake in brokerage
TD Ameritrade ?
 ""In Canada, residential mortgages are good investments and
secure. Subprime mortgages in the United States are not,""
Flaherty said. ""So when one starts looking at definition of
capital, does one exclude residential mortgages?""

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks
dropped on Thursday after an unexpected rise in weekly U.S.
jobless claims underscored the weakening economy, and the euro
slipped a day ahead of the U.S. government's monthly payrolls
report.
 The number of Americans making new claims for jobless
benefits rose by 19,000 to 479,000 in the week ended July 31 --
the highest level in nearly four months. For details, see
[ID:nN05245807] The news, coming a day ahead of the U.S.
government's closely watched monthly payrolls report, put
investors on edge, as stubbornly high unemployment has fueled
concerns on sustainable global growth.
 Treasuries prices rose on a safety bid as investors braced
for the employment report, and oil and commodity prices slipped
on slowing demand. Copper prices were also hit by worries about
the outlook for the real estate market in China, the world's
largest consumer of the industrial metal.
 China's banking regulator ordered lenders to test the
impact of a fall in house prices of up to 50 percent in key
cities where prices have risen sharply, banking and regulatory
sources said on Thursday. [ID:nTOE674014]
 But the U.S. labor market stole the spotlight on Thursday
following the surprisingly weak jobless claims report.
 ""Claims have been maddeningly stubborn to come down, and
that could make for a rough tomorrow,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief
technical strategist at Boston's Delta Global Advisors.
 Economists polled by Reuters expect Friday's U.S. Labor
Department report to show a drop of 65,000 in non-farm payrolls
in July, hurt by the unwinding of the government's hiring for
the census. Private employers are expected to have added 90,000
jobs. [ECI/US]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 35.76
points, or 0.33 percent, at 10,644.67. The benchmark Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 4.49 points, or 0.40 percent,
at 1,122.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 12.71
points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,290.86.
 U.S. stocks were also hurt by July retail sales that were
mostly weaker than expected.The data was a sign that
skittishness about high unemployment and economic conditions
were causing consumers to cut back. [ID:nN05219163]
 Shares of department store operator JC Penney Co Inc
 fell 6.5 percent to $22.41 while youth-oriented apparel
chain Aeropostale Inc  slumped 5.1 percent to $26.04.
 ""The sales data was unimpressive and points to a consumer
who is tapped out,"" said Joseph Battipaglia, market strategist
at Stifel Nicolaus in Yardley, Pennsylvania. ""If payrolls don't
increase and incomes don't rise, it's going to be a bleak
picture for retailers for the rest of the year.""
 Global equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> also was down on the U.S. data, off 0.05
percent, while the Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> dipped 0.06 percent.
 European shares closed lower. The pan-European FTSEurofirst
300 index of top shares <.FTEU3> shed 0.2 percent to 1,068.98
points, slipping from three-month highs hit earlier in the
session.
 Higher-than-expected profits from Barclays  and
Commerzbank  failed to dispel concerns over the
underlying health of Europe's top banks. The lenders shed 4.7
and 2.2 percent, respectively.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 1.7 percent, helped by top
carmaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, which reported its
best operating profit in two years.
 SUMMER LOVE FOR EURO EVAPORATES
 The euro saw selling pressure after being boosted earlier
Thursday by solid German industrial data and signs that Spain
and Greece were making progress in trimming budget deficits.
 The euro was flat at $1.3150 . Earlier it rose to
$1.3234 after the U.S. jobless claims data.
 A strong debt auction in Spain and a vote of confidence
from the International Monetary fund in Greece's efforts to cut
the deficit also boosted euro buying during European trade. For

 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros in three-year bonds at a lower
yield than a previous auction in June, suggesting solid demand
as it copes with fiscal problems. [ID:nLDE6740CM]
 Earlier, both the Bank of England and the European Central
Bank kept interest rates unchanged, as expected.
 The ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said third-quarter
euro zone economic data has come in stronger than expected so
far but the central bank still expects the bloc's economic
recovery to be moderate and uneven. [ID:nLDE67315T]
 Conversely, the dollar was up against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
climbing 0.05 percent at 80.93 from a previous session close of
80.892. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down
0.38 percent at 85.95 from a previous session close of 86.280.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
15/32, with the yield at 2.90 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  was up 2/32, with the yield at 0.54 percent.
The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up 28/32, with
the yield at 4.04 percent.
In energy and commodities prices, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 fell 57 cents, or 0.69 percent, to $81.90 per barrel,
and spot gold prices  fell $1.80, or 0.15 percent, to

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2010 12:40PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Brazil real 'appears overvalued' -IMF," (Adds details on primary surplus, banks in paragraphs 8-11)
 WASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Brazil's currency, the real
 ""appears overvalued,"" the International Monetary Fund
said on Thursday, and it urged long-term solutions to curb the
surge in foreign money flowing into country.
 In its annual review of Brazil, the IMF said huge foreign
capital flows into the country's booming economy had
complicated monetary policy. It called for a ""carefully
calibrated policy mix"" to preserve economic and financial
stability"" in tackling the surge of money into Latin America's
largest economy.
 The IMF emphasized that monetary policy should remain
focused on keeping inflation expectations well-anchored.
 The government last year slapped a 2 percent tax on inflows
to curb the rapid flow of money into Brazil and to contain a
rally in the local currency .
 The real is down about 1.7 percent so far this year. The
government said on June 21 it would prevent the real from
strengthening further if inflows increased.
 The IMF said while it recognized the need for the tax to
curb capital inflows, it suggested it should only be a
temporary solution.
 The IMF said its ""directors suggested that consideration be
given to a long-term response that combines a tightening of
fiscal policy, a lower interest rate, and prudential
measures.""
 The IMF welcomed plans to withdraw fiscal measures put in
place to keep the economy afloat during the financial crisis
and to aim for a higher primary budget surplus target for 2010,
a presidential election year in Brazil in which spending is set
to rise.
 In the 12 months to April, the primary budget surplus was
equivalent to 2.17 percent of gross domestic product, still
below the government's target of 3.3 percent of GDP for this
year.
 The IMF urged further steps to lower both gross and net
debt-to-GDP ratios in Brazil.
 The IMF urged the government to keep an eye over the recent
increase in lending to the household sector. Some IMF board
directors called for a thorough evaluation of the composition
and quality of the capital of public banks.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2010 11:28AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Stocks becoming key c.bank reserve management tool," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Some central banks may invest up
to a quarter of their foreign reserves in equities in the next
five years in order to seek returns that beat those on local
benchmark bonds, Franklin Templeton Investments says.
 Central banks around the world hold a total of $8.3 trillion
in foreign exchange reserves, which they mainly invest in liquid
U.S. Treasuries and euro zone government bonds.
 But these bonds are increasingly low-yielding. Against a
backdrop of rising local government bond yields especially in
emerging economies, central banks are under pressure to find
investments that beat local benchmarks.
 That is why more central banks are looking at riskier
investment, such as stocks, says David Smart, Franklin
Templeton's global head of sovereign funds and supranationals.
 ""Some of the traditional central banks are moving into
equity. A number of central banks allocate 10-15 percent in
equities. It is expected to become rather more common in five
years time,"" Smart told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
 ""If you look at a balance sheet of the country's assets and
liabilities, it makes perfect sense for some to put up to 20
percent in equities. (Allocation) is expected to go up to 20-25
percent, over the next five years.""
 Franklin Templeton manages $43 billion of assets for around
30 sovereign and supranational clients.
 Some countries have moved some of their excess foreign
reserves to sovereign wealth funds to manage more actively for
future generations.
 Smart says certain excess reserves should be managed by
central banks, rather than sovereign wealth funds, unless the
cash pile stemmed from natural resources.
 ""The more traditional sovereign wealth model heavily linked
to commodities probably has a slightly different role compared
with FX reserves,"" Smart said.
 ""When you get to the level of the 'Dutch disease' problem,
having a separate SWF is a good idea. But excess reserves are
not necessarily to do with the 'Dutch disease' problem.""
 The phrase stems from the Dutch economic crisis of the 1960s
following the discovery of North Sea natural gas.
 Resource rich countries can experience large capital inflows
which lead their currencies to appreciate, making their
manufacturing sectors less competitive -- as happened to the
Dutch economy.
 While the mandate of central bank reserve managers is to
maintain liquidity, sovereign wealth funds aim to enhance
returns for future generations by investing in riskier assets.
 Among the countries that saw a sudden rise in FX reserves is
Switzerland. Its foreign exchange reserves rose nearly fivefold
after the central bank intervened heavily in the market to
counter gains in the franc currency.
 ""It doesn't make a great deal of sense for a country whose
reserves stemmed from relatively temporary extraneous shocks to
establish a long-term sovereign wealth fund for
intergenerational sharing. In 10 years time those reserves may
unwind,"" Smart said.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2010 11:20AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Turkey sold Iran 1.2 mln bls gasoline in June-data," * Iran paid 25 percent above normal price for gasoline
imports
 * U.S. sanctions leave Turkey and China main suppliers
 * Gasoline one-third of all Turkish exports to Iran in June
 
 (Adds background, comment, context)
 By David Sheppard and Humeyra Pamuk
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Turkey exported far more gasoline
to Iran in June than previously indicated ahead of far reaching
U.S.-led sanctions, figures from the Turkish government received
by Reuters showed on Thursday.
 Turkey sold 138,673 tonnes of the motor fuel to Iran in
June, the equivalent of more than four standard cargo tankers,
or 1.2 million barrels.
 The Islamic Republic turned to Turkey and China for gasoline
imports when most other sellers stopped supplying it ahead of
U.S. sanctions, which came into force in July.
 The threat of sanctions meant Iran had to pay well above the
norm for the fuel, data from TUIK, the Turkish statistical
institute, showed.
 Turkey received $121.8 million from Iran for the sales,
which amounted to an average of $878 a tonne. That is 25 percent
above the average spot price in the Mediterranean in June of
around $700 a tonne, according to Reuters data.
 ""It's a ridiculous level but not unexpected,"" one European
gasoline trader said. ""When every oil major and trader is being
pressured to drop supply, it comes down to the Turks and
Chinese.""
 
 TURKEY AND CHINA
 Turkish refiner Tupras began supplying gasoline to Iran in
June after a hiatus of at least 18 months, trade sources said.
 Just one cargo of gasoline sailed from Turkey to Iran that
month, the sources had said, though some traders and brokers
told Reuters it was possible that supplies might have passed
over the land border between the two countries.
 The TUIK data did not specify how many tonnes went by sea.
 The sales of gasoline to Iran in June made up more than
one-third of all of Turkey's exports to the Islamic Republic
that month, the data showed.
 In July, only three cargoes of gasoline reached Iran from
all suppliers, according to a shipping document seen by Reuters,
though some traders said Iran needed less than the seasonal norm
after stockpiling ahead of the U.S. sanctions.
 The West suspects Iran of attempting to build nuclear
weapons, but Tehran says its development of nuclear technology
is for peaceful purposes.
 The Tupras June shipment came just days after Turkey and
Brazil brokered a nuclear fuel swap plan with Tehran, aiming to
quell international fears over Iran's atomic ambitions.
 Wide ranging U.S. and European Union sanctions from last
month were designed to squeeze Iran's fuel imports and increase
its international isolation.
 Iran is the second-largest crude oil producer in the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) but
relies on imports for up to 40 percent of its gasoline needs
because it lacks refining capacity.
 Pressure on Iran was compounded in July when insurance
market Lloyd's of London said it would not insure or reinsure
petroleum shipments going into Iran.
 The owner of a gasoline tanker refused to allow the vessel
to sail to Iran from Turkey later in July, according to trade
and shipping sources.

 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday,
boosted by solid German industrial data and signs Spain and
Greece were making progress in trimming budget deficits, while
an unexpected rise in initial U.S. jobless claims weakened the
dollar.
 But currencies were restricted to fairly narrow ranges, and
the euro surrendered most earlier gains, as investors squared

 Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to
have lost 65,000 jobs last month while adding 90,000 in the
private sector.
 ""No one will want to be short of dollars if there is a
positive outcome,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist
at Nordea. ""But nothing has changed the negative dollar
environment.""
 The euro was last at $1.3174, up 0.1 percent but off a
session peak of $1.3234, reached after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said incoming third-quarter data
was stronger than expected. The dollar fell 0.4 percent to
85.90 yen, just over a yen away from a 15-year low.
 U.S. data showed the number of Americans filing for initial
unemployment benefits rose by 19,000 to the highest level since
April. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a decline.
 The New Zealand dollar fell 1 percent to $0.7265 after the
release of weak local jobless data. The Canadian dollar neared
a three-month high at C$1.0107 per U.S. dollar, boosted by
merger and acquisitions speculation.
 MORE GOOD NEWS FROM EUROPE
 The euro has risen 7 percent against the dollar since July,
boosted largely by stronger-than-expected data even as
countries cut spending sharply to trim deficits and forestall a
debt crisis.
 More good news helped it on Thursday. A senior
International Monetary Fund official told Reuters that Greece
would receive a second tranche of international aid after an
impressive start on its austerity plan.
 And Spain sold 3.5 billion euros in three-year bonds at a
lower yield than a previous auction in June, suggesting solid
demand for debt from the country that has been experiencing
debt problems.
 Both countries were at the forefront of a euro zone debt
crisis that drove the current below $1.19 in June, its worst
showing since 2006.
 The euro also benefited from data showing German industrial
orders data rose 3.2 percent in June, surpassing expectations
on strong foreign demand.
 DOLLAR REBOUND ON THE HORIZON?
 Recent signs of slower U.S. growth have hobbled the dollar,
with weakness in housing and a sluggish labor market causing
concern. Speculation that the Federal Reserve could embrace
more monetary easing to boost the economy also hurt the dollar
this week and pushed down short-dated U.S. Treasury yields.
 But ""the market increasingly thinks the Fed probably won't
do anything drastic after all, because while the U.S. data has
been weak, it's not dire enough to panic,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 If Friday's data meets or exceeds expectations, he said the
dollar will likely rally to cap off the week.
 Earlier, the euro fell briefly below $1.3125, which marks
the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's November-to-June
decline, and Dolan said a close below there would clear the way
for more dollar gains.
 Currency strategists at Standard Chartered said in a note
to clients Thursday that investors should use current dollar
weakness ""to renew underweight positions in European currencies
such as the euro and sterling,"" noting that September debt
rollovers and the start of Britain's fiscal tightening will
hurt those two currencies.
 Sterling was down 0.2 percent at $1.5858 but still close to
a six-month high above $1.59.

 By Dina Kyriakidou and Ingrid Melander
 ATHENS, Aug 5 (Reuters) - International inspectors on
Thursday applauded Greece's efforts to exit its debt crisis,
endorsing a fresh 9 billion euro payment from an EU/IMF bailout
scheme, but urged reforms in energy, banking and the public
sector.
 In their most positive assessment so far that offered an
antidote to market scepticism, IMF, ECB and European Commission
officials said Athens would likely meet this year's deficit
cutting target, though risks remained.
 ""This was a very ambitious programme with a lot of
front-loading, and the good news is that it is being implemented
as agreed,"" the IMF's mission chief for Greece Poul Thomsen told
Reuters in an interview.
 Officials from the so-called 'Troika' told reporters at the
end of an inspection visit ahead of the release of the second
tranche of the 110 billion euro ($145 billion) programme in
September that they now sought reforms in energy, banking and
the public sector.
 ""Despite considerable progress on a very vast array of
areas, key challenges and risks remain,"" said Servaas Deroose,
deputy director general for economic and financial affairs at
the European Commission.
 Commenting on the assessment by the international
inspectors, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
said at a news conference in Frankfurt, ""It doesn't mean that a
very hard job should not continue to be done.""
 Reforms were crucial to restore investor confidence and
allow Greece to return to international bond markets some time
next year as planned.
 Deroose said Athens must come up with a plan to free up the
energy market by the end of the year, adding the banking sector
also needed restructuring. He said he government was preparing a
strategic review of lenders in September.
 
 MARKETS WARY
 Greece's debt crisis has shaken the euro zone and
effectively blocked Athens from markets, with the cost of
borrowing briefly hitting 1,000 basis points over German bunds.
Spreads have been relatively steady at around 750 basis points
since Prime Minister George Papandreou asked for aid in May.
 Five-year credit default swaps were at 712 basis points at
1030 GMT versus 130 for Italy, the benchmark for the euro zone's
peripheral economies. This means it would cost 712,000 euros to
insure 10 million euros of Greek debt against default.
 Analysts said Greece now may actually come close or even
meet a target to cut its budget deficit from 13.6 percent of GDP
in 2009 to 8.1 percent this year, thanks to bigger than expected
spending cuts offsetting low revenues.
 ""People were fearing that the programme was not succeeding
just a few months ago. So, it's definitely a positive
development,"" said Giada Giani of Citigroup. ""It does not mean
that the challenges are not there anymore.
 Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said Greece may
actually do better than expected on the deficit target despite
lagging revenues.
 ""On the basis of GDP development and higher than expected
inflation ... we will have a deficit below 8.1 percent by the
end of the year,"" he told reporters.
 Inspectors said the biggest spending risk areas are state
hospitals, municipalities and state-owned companies, which have
long burned holes in the budget.
 A weak economy was also a challenge. Despite the
government's more optimistic views of a milder than expected
recession, the IMF and the EU said there was no reason to revise
a 4 percent GDP decline. Greece plunged into its first recession
in 16 years in 2009 after years of booming growth.
 Inflation has jumped to over 5 percent in May and June, much
higher than the euro zone average, partly due to value added tax
(VAT) and other tax hikes, showing weak competitiveness and
highlighting the need to open up professions and markets.
 The EU and the IMF revised their inflation forecast for this
year to 4.75 percent from an earlier 1.9 percent projection but
said they expected the pace to slow to 1.5-2 percent next year.
 
 CHALLENGES AHEAD 
 After a slow start, Papandreou's socialist government has
bitten the bullet and imposed draconian austerity measures,
cutting public salaries and hiking taxes.
 It has launched long-delayed pension and labour reforms,
despite strikes and protests that have disrupted tourism,
transport and services, and eroded its popularity.
 On Thursday, the finance ministry was briefly evacuated due
to a bomb hoax just as the minister was due to begin a news
conference on the 'Troika' visit.
 Opposing the reforms, seamen blocked ports at the start of
the key tourist season in May and truckers went on strike for a
week affecting fuel and goods supply, but the government stood
its ground and ordered them back to work.
 Thomsen welcomed the government's firm stance: ""What this
has shown to me is that this government is serious about reform.
It is not going to back off just because a special interest
group is opposing reforms,"" he said. 
 But analysts say the next clash with workers, expected to be
with the powerful union at the state PPC utility opposing
liberalisation, will be much tougher.
 Analysts said they would be eyeing longer term reforms to
assess if Greece is making real progress.
 ""Bringing the deficit below 3 percent of GDP (by 2014) is
obviously going to take a long time, so the risk is whether the
strength of the reforms and the strength of the fiscal
tightening remains in place over the coming years,"" said Diego
Iscaro of IHS Global Insight.
""Especially because the political situation is likely to
deteriorate ... if unemployment remains high and people are more
unwilling to make sacrifices,"" he added.

 By Jan Lopatka and Roman Gazdik
 PRAGUE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank left
interest rates unchanged on Thursday and signalled they would
stay stable for longer than previously expected as a strong
currency and slow recovery keeps inflation in check.
 The bank kept its main two-week repo rate, used to drain
excess liquidity, at an all-time low of 0.75 percent, where it
has been since the last cut in May. 
 Governor Miroslav Singer also said the level of the Czech
crown -- whose 6.6 percent rise against the euro this year has
led the region and curbed inflation -- was ""no big drama"" if it
stayed around where it is now.
 The bank also raised its 2010 growth forecast to 1.6 percent
of GDP and stuck with a prediction of 1.8 percent for next year.
 But it cut its forecast of the 2011 level of the 3-month
Prague interbank rate -- whose development is often indicative
of movement on official rates -- by half a percentage point to
1.4 percent. The rate on Thursday was 1.22 percent 
 Analysts said the change in the Pribor outlook most likely
took into account both official rates staying near current
levels slightly longer than previously forecast and also
probably the last quarter percentage point cut that came as it
released its last inflation report.
 ""We see at this point quite long stability, gradual growth
only from the second half of the next year, which is again
reaction to the recovery not being very strong,"" Singer said.
 ""Inflation pressures do not seem to us to be so significant
that they would force us to dramatically expect interest rate
changes.""
 No bank in the European Union's emerging eastern wing is
expected to hike interest rates in the short term.
 But the policy cycles are expected to diverge later this
year, with Poland potentially raising by 25 basis points.
 Romania left its cost of borrowing on hold on Wednesday,
while non-EU member Serbia, hiked its main rate in a surprise
move by a half point to 8.5 percent, citing a growing inflation
risk as the dinar, Europe's worst performing currency this year,
hovered near record lows.
 
 NO DRAMA, FAST FIRMING
 Market watchers have been on tenterhooks for comments on the
crown since it broke 25 per euro and started drifting into
territory where the bank has verbally intervened in the past.
Singer did not say it was a threat for now.
 ""If the train stops somewhere around where it is now, it is
no drama,"" he said. ""If it continues further at this pace, then
we will be getting to levels where the inflation outlook would
change, and that would force us to react to those changes.""
 The crown, which had slipped weaker ahead of Singer's news
conference, firmed to 24.73 per euro but was still weaker than
Wednesday's 21-month high of 24.61. That compares to the bank's
forecast of an average 2010 rate of 25.4.
 Another factor that may quell inflation and growth is the
new centre-right government's pledge to cut the fiscal gap to
4.6-4.8 percent of gross domestic product next year from this
year's target of 5.3 percent. 
 The cuts should include a 10 percent cut in the public wage
bill, excluding teachers, cuts in social benefits and the
freezing of a number of road building projects, but Singer said
there would be only a limited impact on inflation and rates.
 ""Quality-wise there is a little more visible impact on GDP
but the rest, in other words what is important for us --
inflation and interest rates -- would only be affected in a
negligible way,"" he said.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday,
boosted by solid German industrial data and signs that Spain
and Greece are making progress in trimming budget deficits.
 The currency also got a lift after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said incoming economic data for
the third quarter showed stronger-than-expected euro zone
growth. The ECB held interest rates at 1 percent as expected.
 Trichet ""sounded quite positive and constructive,"" said
Sacha Tihanyi, strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto, and
that has added to a prevailing market tendency to buy euros.
 A U.S. report showing the number of Americans filing for
first-time jobless benefits rose unexpectedly in the latest
week also hurt the dollar, leaving it about one yen away from a
15-year low against the Japanese currency.
 Currencies were restricted to fairly narrow ranges, though,
with investors reluctant to bet too much ahead of Friday's U.S.
jobs report and what it says about the U.S. recovery.
 Economists polled by Reuters expect to see a loss of 65,000
U.S. jobs in July, but a 90,000 gain in private sector jobs.
Data from ADP Employment Services on Wednesday forecast the
economy added 43,000 private sector jobs.
 The euro rose to $1.3217, up about half a percent on the
day, while the dollar was off 0.5 percent at 85.85 yen.
 A senior International Monetary Fund official told Reuters
that Greece would receive a second tranche of international aid
after an impressive start on its austerity plan, and that it
must now shift to drastic reforms to return to growth.

 The euro benefited Thursday from data showing German
industrial orders data rose 3.2 percent in June, surpassing
expectations on strong foreign demand.
 Earlier, the euro weakened, though support at around
$1.3125 appeared to hold. That level marks the 38.2 percent
retracement of the euro's November-to-June decline, and traders
said a close below there could prompt further falls.

background)
 By Gleb Bryanski and Aleksandras Budrys
 MOSCOW, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Thursday announced a temporary ban on grain exports to
keep inflation in check after the worst heatwave on record
ravaged crops, news which sent wheat prices to contract highs.
 ""I think it is advisable to introduce a temporary ban on the
export from Russia of grain and other agriculture products made
from grain,"" Putin told a government meeting.
 Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the ban will become
effective from Aug.15 and will apply to contracts already
signed.
 ""This ban will be temporary in character. We will talk later
about how we will behave after December,"" Putin said, indicating
that the ban will be in force at least until December.
September wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade rose to be
limit-up 60 cents to $7.85-3/4 a bushel, a contract high and a
23-month peak for front-month prices.
 Putin also pledged 10 billion roubles ($335 million) in
subsidies and another 25 billion roubles in loans to the farm
sector, and said that grain from the government intervention
fund would be distributed to regions without auctions.
 ""We have enough reserves -- 9.5 million tonnes -- but we
must not allow a rise of food prices in Russia, retain the
livestock count and form reserves for next year,"" Putin said.
 ""Of course the government is interested in selling this
resource via auction, but our aim is not to make more money but
help those agricultural producers who need this help.""
 The government had earlier planned to start intervention
tenders to sell some 3 million tonnes of grains from its stocks
to flour millers, animal breeders and feed makers on a tender
basis.
 Earlier on Thursday, Interfax reported that the government
planned to ban the export of wheat, barley, rye, corn and flour.
 
 GRAIN EXPORTERS WILL BENEFIT
 Andrei Sizov Sr., CEO of SovEcon agricultural analysts said
he believed any ban would not apply to grain already being
loaded at ports.
 ""Traders will be able to cite force majeure and not to
fulfil September and October contracts,"" Sizov told Reuters.
""This may also affect Egypt's and Jordan's latest purchases.""
 Egypt has recently bought 180,000 tonnes of Russian wheat
for September delivery, while Jordan has bought 50,000 tonnes of
Black Sea wheat for first-half September shipment.
 The Russian unit of grain trader Glencore, in a Reuters
interview earlier this week, called for a ban on exports.
 The Russian government imposed a ban on grain exports from
January to May 1999 during a period in which it received food
aid after its disastrous 1998 harvest.
 Russia obtained a $1.5 billion package of food aid from the
United States and the European Union in 1999 to offset the
impact of the worst grain harvest in decades of 48 million
tonnes and a rouble currency devaluation.
 The Agriculture Ministry estimates this year's harvest at
70-75 million tonnes, down around a quarter from last year,
although some analysts see this as low as 65 million tonnes.
 Russia restricted exports by high export tariffs in 2004 and
2007, simultaneously selling grain from government stocks to
domestic consumers.

 (Corrects year in paragraph 8)
 By Ivana Sekularac
 BELGRADE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Serbia's central bank surprised
markets by raising interest rates  by 50 basis
points to 8.50 percent on Thursday, citing a growing risk of
inflation at a time of dinar weakness.
 The move, the first interest rate decision under new central
bank governor Dejan Soskic, gave a small boost to the Serbian
dinar, which hit a record low against the euro earlier this week
and has lost about 11 percent this year.
 ""The executive board decided that the 0.5 percentage point
hike of the repo rate is necessary to reach targeted inflation,""
the bank said in a statement.
 A Reuters poll published on Wednesday showed 12 out of 14
currency dealers and bank analysts expecting an unchanged rate
of 8 percent, with a rate hike more likely in September.
 After the interest rate hike, the Serbian dinar picked up
and traded in 105.77-105.97 range to the euro, from the morning
level of 105.94-106.14 range, a trader said.
 The Serbian unit of Raiffeisen International said after the
announcement that more bank moves could be forthcoming.
 ""Once triggered, psychological inflationary pressures are
hardly tackled via mild rational moves. Thus, in order to regain
the shattered trust, we expect even sharper moves,"" it said.
 The central bank estimated July consumer price inflation at
around 5 percent, up from 4.2 percent in June and 3.7 percent in
May. The bank targets 2010 inflation in the 4-8 percent range.
 In an interview published earlier on Thursday Soskic said a
one percent depreciation in the dinar increases inflation by 0.3
percentage point.""In the future the bank will have to move
towards a more restrictive policy to maintain targeted
inflation,"" Soskic told the weekly NIN.
 The bank had cut its benchmark interest rate by a total of
9.75 percentage points in a cycle of easing stretching back to
January last year, with the last cut in May bringing it down to
8 percent.
 
 MOVE IN RIGHT DIRECTION
 Raising interest rates is clearly an effort to attract more
investors to dinar investments, such as bond investors looking
for higher yields. Yet the unstable dinar has deterred many this
year.
 Serbia's currency has fallen more than any other country in
Europe in 2010, boosting exports but creating a risk that
government borrowing costs will rise as investors grow wary
about dinar treasury bills.
 Sojan Stamenkovic, an economist and member of Serbian prime
minister's economic council, said the central bank move was
aimed to boost the dinar.
 ""I am not sure how successful it will be, we'll see, but
it's a move in the right direction,"" he told Reuters.
 He said he was not confident the move would draw more
investors to invest in dinar treasury bills that are used to
finance the budget deficit.
 ""The problem with our exchange rate is that we have a
negative credit balance, when you exclude the IMF credits,"" he
said. 
 Serbia's economy remains weak and the International Monetary
Fund expects 2010 growth of just 1.5 percent, after a 3 percent
contraction in 2009.
 The impact from higher interest rates on Serbia's growth may
be less than in many countries as banks make the overwhelming
bulk of their loans in euros, not dinars.
 Last month, Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic said Serbia's
economy grew 1.8 percent year-on-year in the second quarter --
triple the pace of first-quarter growth.
The central bank executive board will meet again on August
19 to decide on rates.

 (Adds details)
 BEIJING, Aug 5 (Reuters) - China's economy is on course for
stable growth, but the pressure for wage increases will
intensify and authorities must manage inflationary expectations,
the central bank said on Thursday.
 In its monetary policy report for the second quarter, the
People's Bank of China also said that the economy would see
considerable net foreign currency inflows, but repeated that
there was no basis for big swings in the yuan's exchange rate.
 The central bank offered guarded optimism about the global
economy, saying that it was on the road to recovery, despite
challenges posed by the euro crisis and government deficits.
 ""The national (Chinese) economy is likely to gradually move
towards steady and sustainable growth, upon the foundation of a
rapid recovery,"" it said.
 Countries around the world will be prudent in implementing
exit strategies and global monetary conditions are likely to
remain loose, while China will also maintain its ""appropriately
loose"" monetary policy, the central bank said.
 China's economy grew 10.3 percent year on year in the second
quarter, and analysts expect the data for July, due next week,
to point to a clear slowdown in the second half. Inflation is
also seen picking up, though only temporarily. [ID:nTOE673079]
 The central bank said inflation would be controllable in the
second half, with economic trends pointing to a lessening of
price pressures.
 Nevertheless, it added that the government still had its
work cut out in managing inflationary expectations and that the
pressure for wage increases was clearly on the rise.
 ""The current inflationary expectations and upward price
risks should not be neglected,"" it said.
 
 YUAN GOING GLOBAL
 Turning to the Chinese currency, the central bank stuck
word-for-word to the long-established official description of
exchange rate policy, saying that the yuan would be kept
basically stable at a reasonable, balanced level.
 The yuan was unshackled from a nearly two-year peg to the
dollar in June and has risen just 0.8 percent since then.
 But in a sign of its larger ambitions for its currency, the
People's Bank gave a detailed update about how the yuan had been
faring as a medium for trade settlement.
 Beijing launched a trial last July to allow firms doing
business between China and a select few trading partners,
notably Hong Kong, to invoice transactions in yuan.
 The total turnover of yuan-settled trade was 48.7 billion
yuan ($7.2 billion) in the second quarter, an increase of 165
percent from the first quarter, the central bank said.
 Since the launch of the scheme in July 2009, total
settlement reached 70.6 billion yuan, with 87 percent of the
trade with Hong Kong and Singapore.
 On June 22, China expanded the trade-settlement programe to
all countries around the world, and the central bank said it
would continue to push forward the scheme.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The euro turned higher against the
dollar on Thursday, lifted by a smooth Spanish debt auction and
positive comments about Greece's progress in reducing its
deficit from the International Monetary Fund.
 The euro also benefited from data showing German industrial
orders rose 3.2 percent in June, surpassing expectations thanks
to strong foreign demand.
 Investors brushed off the European Central bank's widely
expected decision to hold interest rates at a record low 1.0
percent, and awaited a press conference by President Jean-Claude
Trichet for his view on the euro zone's economic recovery.
 Overall, trade was lacklustre as investors were wary of
taking on big positions in the dollar ahead of key U.S. non-farm
payrolls figures on Friday, which are expected to provide
near-term direction for the U.S. currency.
 ""The euro is getting a boost from the Spanish auction and
reacting to the IMF comments on Greece, but trade will probably
be choppy going into tomorrow's payrolls data,"" said Paul
Robson, currency strategist at RBS.
 A senior IMF official told Reuters that Greece would receive
a second tranche of international aid thanks to an impressive
start on its austerity plan, and that it must now shift to
drastic reforms to return to growth.
 Spain on Thursday sold 3.5 billion euros of three-year bonds
at a lower yield than a previous auction in June, suggesting
solid demand for debt from the country whose debt problems have
been under market scrutiny.
 Analysts said Trichet may be upbeat about the euro zone
economy when he speaks to the media at 1230 GMT, given recent
successful bank stress tests, positive German economic data and
solid European bank earnings, but that this is unlikely to be
market-moving.
 At 1148 GMT, the euro traded 0.4 percent higher on the day
at $1.3206. It hovered near the day's high around $1.3225,
recovering from a slide to $1.3120.
 The session low took the single currency below $1.3125 --
the 38.2 percent retracement of the November to June decline --
and traders said a close below there could prompt further falls.
 The dollar index slipped 0.2 percent to 80.695, taking it
back under its 200-day moving average around 80.769. A close
below that level may keep overall selling pressure on the U.S.
currency.
 
 PAYROLLS AHEAD
 The dollar had edged up in earlier trade as traders unwound
bets against the currency thanks to some better signs on the
economy ahead of key U.S. non-farm payrolls figures on Friday.
 An ADP report on Wednesday showed the U.S. added 42,000 jobs
in July. Coupled with encouraging service sector data, that
relieved some of the recent pessimism about the world's biggest
economy, but traders said more good news was needed to overturn
negative dollar sentiment.
 Economists polled by Reuters estimated that Friday's data
would show U.S. non-farm payrolls fell 65,000 in July as layoffs
of federal census workers continued.
 ""No one will want to be short of dollars if there is a
positive outcome,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist
at Nordea.
 ""But nothing has changed the negative dollar environment.""
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 86.08 yen, but stayed near
an eight-month low of 85.32 yen hit on Wednesday.
 Sterling edged up 0.2 percent to the day's high of $1.5925,
tracking gains in the euro against the U.S. currency.
 Market participants said the pound offered little reaction
to the Bank of England's decision to hold interest rates at an
all-time low of 0.5 percent, which had been expected.
 Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar fell 1 percent against the
U.S. dollar after weak local jobless data while Canadian
dollar-positive M&A speculation lifted the Canadian currency to
a near three-month high versus the greenback.

 By David Milliken
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept interest
rates at a record-low 0.5 percent on Thursday, a decision which
was no surprise to economists but probably conceals a vigorous
debate about whether Britain is at greater risk from slow growth
or high inflation.
 As usual the BoE made no comment on the economy in its terse
policy statement, which also confirmed that the central bank was
making no change to its 200 billion pounds ($317 billion) of
quantitative easing asset purchases.
 More clarity on the decision will come next Wednesday, when
the central bank publishes a quarterly update to its growth and
inflation forecasts, which the nine-member Monetary Policy
Committee had access to when reaching today's decision.
 ""It was very much as expected. The focus is going to be on
the Inflation Report next week where markets will be looking to
assess if there has been any change in the tone on the outlook
for policy,"" said UBS economist Amit Kara.
 ""Our sense is that the message will be very similar to the
one that Mervyn King gave at the Treasury Select Committee,
which is really one of caution and 'give growth a chance'.""
 Although consumer price inflation at 3.2 percent is well
above the BoE's 2 percent target, most policymakers view the
factors that pushed it up -- sterling weakness, higher sales tax
and higher oil prices -- as one-offs that will fade away.
 Most economists predict growth will slow from the
unexpectedly strong 1.1 percent recorded between April and June
because of looming government spending cuts, weak European
demand for UK exports and banks' continuing reluctance to lend.
 None of the 61 economists polled last week expected a change
in policy, and most did not expect a rise in interest rates
until April next year at the earliest -- a view which the latest
decision appeared to do little to change.
 Sterling  and gilt futures  barely moved after
the policy announcement, despite 10-year gilt yields edging to a
15-month low earlier in the session.
 The BoE cut interest rates to 0.5 percent in March 2009
during the depths of Britain's recession, and launched a
programme of quantitative easing, buying 200 billion pounds of
assets -- mostly gilts -- by February 2010 to pump money into
the economy.
 
 SENTANCE ALONE AGAIN?
 Minutes of Thursday's decision will only be published on
Aug. 18. Last month's decision surprised many economists as the
MPC discussed looser policy for the first time since February.
 Former British Airways economist Andrew Sentance was the
only voice calling for higher interest rates in June and July.
This month he is likely to have felt vindicated by an unexpected
1.1 percent surge in second-quarter GDP growth last month.
 August's inflation report forecast is also likely to suggest
the BoE will miss its CPI target throughout next year, in
contrast to May when it forecast consumer price inflation would
sink below target at the start of 2011 and stay there for the
next 2-1/2 years.
 Late last month both BoE Governor Mervyn King and Chief
Economist Spencer Dale said a recently announced Jan. 1 rise in
value-added tax to 20 percent from 17.5 percent will make it
unlikely that inflation will return to target until 2012.
 However, this does not mean King and Dale will have argued
for higher rates this month. Tighter policy typically takes more
than a year to have an effect on inflation, making it an
ineffective tool to combat one-off rises in prices.
 Instead, most policymakers appear more worried about a
possible fall in demand next year when 25 percent government
spending cuts start to take effect and banks must repay nearly
200 billion pounds of emergency BoE loans taken out during the
credit crunch.
 August's meeting was the first to include former economic
think tank director Martin Weale, the replacement for
long-serving MPC member Kate Barker, who stepped down after
May's meeting.

(Adds background, details)
 By Simon Johnson and Camilla Bergsli
 STOCKHOLM/OSLO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Better than expected
employment figures in Sweden and Norway on Thursday suggested the
economic recovery in both countries is gathering pace,
increasing the likelihood of early interest rate hikes.
 In contrast to many other European countries, both Nordic
states were quick to recover from the downturn as their
governments dug into deep coffers to boost domestic demand.
 In recent quarters, a pick-up in global growth has helped
Sweden's large export sector and Norway's huge oil industry has
bounced back along with crude prices.
 In Sweden, figures from the statistics office on Thursday
showed underlying joblessness is falling faster than expected.
 While the headline figure for June rose as students were
included on the rolls for the summer, the rise was smaller than
the market forecast. Stripping out this seasonal effect,
unemployment fell to 8.1 percent from 8.7 percent the previous
month and from 8.4 percent a year earlier.
 The number of employed rose on an annual basis for the first
increase since the autumn of 2008, while the hours worked also
rose significantly for the first time in almost two years.
 ""The labour market in Sweden looks to be seeing a stronger
development,"" Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg told
reporters. ""This strengthens the view that we may have to revise
down unemployment (forecasts)."" 
 The government, facing an election in September, has
forecast unemployment at 8.9 percent this year. [ID:nLDE6740KE]
 The Swedish crown initially firmed after the data but came
off highs to trade at 9.39 against the euro at 1042 GMT. The
Norwegian crown was little moved by the data, mainly following
global trends and trading at 7.887 to the euro.
 
 NORTH STARS
 The effects of the global financial crisis were mild in
Norway and while the country rebounded quickly, the pace of
recovery has slowed.
 Thursday's jobless figures there, coupled with data earlier
this week, offered evidence that the economy may be speeding up
again.
 Unemployment in Norway, the world's fifth biggest oil
exporter and second biggest gas exporter, held steady at 3.6
percent in the April-June period. Analysts had expected a rise.
[ID:nLDE6740MX]
 Earlier this week, Norway's purchasing managers' index (PMI)
rose to its highest level in two years while credit to Norwegian
businesses increased for the first time since October 2009,
raising hopes of an accelerated recovery. [ID:nLDE6711DT]
 Norway's central bank was the first in the developed world
to raise interest rates after the downturn. At its last meeting,
Norges Bank signalled that it would not hike again until at
least October, citing the country's stuttering recovery and euro
zone debt risks.
 The bank meets next week but analysts have generally not
priced in another rate hike until around the turn of the year
given forecasts for a still sluggish recovery.
 Sweden has bounced back from its worst recession since World
War Two, with the economy growing at its fastest pace in more
than three years in the second quarter. [ID:nLDE66T0MG]
 The country's central bank raised rates in July, the first
time since the crisis struck the country in late 2008, and is
widely expected to keep on hiking.
 ""The Riksbank is already determined to raise interest
rates,"" said Tor Borg, economist at SBAB. ""Our view is that they
will hike by 25 basis points at every meeting (this year) now.""

 * Strike by nearly one million civil servants due next week
 * Unions say no deal
 
 (Updates with unions' rejecting deal, analyst)
 By Jon Herskovitz
 PRETORIA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The South African government
raised its pay offer to civil servants on Thursday to try to
avert a strike that could cripple commerce in the continent's
largest economy, but the gesture was quickly rejected.
 Around one million public sector workers under the umbrella
of the country's biggest labour organisation COSATU have
threatened a national strike from next week.
 Analysts expect more sparring between the groups in the
coming days but believe a deal tilted in the unions' favour will
be reached to head off a repeat of mass action by civil servants
three years ago that battered the economy.
 The Public Service Ministry said in a statement that it was
prepared to increase salaries by 7 percent, after previously
offering 6.5 percent. Its offer of a monthly housing allowance
of 630 rand ($86) remained unchanged.
 Unions are demanding an increase of 8.6 percent -- double
the current inflation rate -- and a housing allowance of 1,000
rand, which would put pressure on the state budget.
 The government says the combined demands amount to a raise
of 9 percent and would make it nearly impossible to fulfil its
commitment to bring its budget deficit down from 6.7 percent of
GDP. Spending on personnel is the largest sector of the budget.
 ""These are above what is affordable,"" Public Services
Minister Richard Baloyi told a news conference, urging unions to
accept the latest offer or face the prospect of cutbacks in
other parts of the budget.
 ""We have to take painful decisions,"" he said.
 Workers who have threatened to strike include customs and
immigration officers, police, health care staff and teachers.
 ""COSATU public sector unions are deeply angered by the
government's failure to accede to the moderate wage increase
demands of the workers,"" the unions said in a statement. 
 The latest offer suggests the ruling African National
Congress (ANC) has little stomach for a fight with organised
labour, with whom it has a long-standing political alliance
forged in the struggle against apartheid.
 ""The government has strong political incentives to reach an
early settlement, but this poses fiscal risks,"" Eurasia Group
Africa analyst Anne Fruhauf said in a recent research note.
 The ANC also does not want to see a long halt in public
services which could erode support before national elections are
held early next year for almost all local government posts.

 * Obama highlights auto industry turnaround
(Recasts with Obama remarks)
 By Jeff Mason
 CHICAGO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on
Thursday defended his decision to bail out U.S. auto makers as
he unveiled a new loan guarantee for Ford Motor Co that will
help to meet a White House goal of doubling U.S. exports.
 ""Don't bet against the American worker. Don't loose faith
in the American people. Don't loose faith in American industry.
We are coming back,"" he said in a rousing campaign-style speech
to a cheering crowd of hundreds at a Ford assembly plant.
 The U.S. Export-Import Bank earlier said it had approved a
Ford loan guarantee to finance $3.1 billion in exports of cars
and trucks to customers in Canada and Mexico.
 Obama visited his home town of Chicago in an effort to
highlight the U.S. auto industry's export potential and his
administration's role in revitalizing the sector.
 The bank's loan guarantee will cover more than 200,000 Ford
vehicle exports, representing 15 percent of the company's 2009
production.
 ""This transaction alone will support thousands of high
paying export-related American jobs by exporting superior goods
and services to international buyers,"" Fred Hochberg, chairman
and president of Ex-Im Bank, said in a statement.
 Obama's trip is his second in a week to highlight what his
administration sees as one of its top economic successes:
turning around grim prospects for the U.S. auto industry and
saving valuable manufacturing jobs.
 Last week Obama visited General Motors Co and Chrysler
plants in Detroit, where he defended his decision to bail out
those two companies in 2009.
 ""The Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO) will
provide the funding for the revolving $250 million loan backed
by Ex-Im's guarantee,"" the Ex-Im Bank said. ""The loan, fees and
interest will be paid off in one year.""
 Plants in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Kentucky and Ohio
will manufacture the vehicles.
 In his Ford trip that focused on trade, Obama told workers,
""We're tired of just buying from everyone else.""
 Ford avoided the bankruptcies that engulfed GM and Chrysler
but supported its rivals in their requests for U.S. government
funding that also helped to prevent a collapse of the auto
parts supply base.
 JOBS, JOBS, JOBS
 The president, a Democrat, is eager to emphasize economic
success stories ahead of November congressional elections that
are expected to produce significant gains for Republicans, who
have hammered Obama for failing to reduce near double-digit
unemployment levels.
 The Obama administration points to the auto sector as one
area where its actions saved jobs.
 Ford plans to add 1,200 jobs for a second production shift
at its Chicago Assembly Plant, where it expects to start
building a new version of its Ford Explorer SUV later in 2010.
 Some of the Chicago jobs will be filled by current Ford
workers on indefinite layoff and some by new workers at lower
wages negotiated with the United Auto Workers union.
 The plant was retooled with help from a $400 million Energy
Department loan extended to help the company make more
fuel-efficient vehicles. The Explorer is a leaner and greener
make-over of its once hot-selling SUV that was a cash cow for
the automaker a decade ago.
 The Obama administration believes the smaller and more
fuel-efficient Explorer is prime for export and that Ford has
embraced Obama's wish for American business to be more
aggressive in capturing overseas market share.
 Ford expects to be solidly profitable this year, but it
borrowed more than $23 billion in late 2006 to fund its
turnaround, leaving it with a far heavier debt load than the
post-bankruptcy GM and Chrysler.

 ISTANBUL, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Turkish markets weakened on
Thursday as political tensions surrounding military appointments
to key leadership posts weighed on currency and bonds.
 Turkey's lira weakened to 1.5020 against the dollar on the
interbank market from the previous day's close of 1.4985. The
yield on the April 25, 2012, benchmark bond climbed to 8.43
percent from the previous day's 8.32 percent.
 Turkey's powerful military, the second largest in NATO,
failed to appoint a new chief of staff or head of ground forces
amid a rift with the government over 11 officers facing arrest
warrants issued in late July over their alleged role in a plot
to overthrow the government.
 ""(The) Supreme Military Council meeting has been a source of
tension due to conflict between the government and the military,
regarding the promotions and the appointments of military
personnel,"" said Is Invest in a note.
 ""The tension between military and the government will
continue to weigh on markets,"" the note said.
 The Istanbul stock exchange main index was trading flat on
the day at 59,877 after reaching several all-time highs last
week, which has made the index vulnerable to profit taking.
 The Istanbul bourse underperformed the MSCI index of
emerging market shares which was trading up 0.11 percent. 
 European shares were flat on Thursday as investors eyed
meetings of the European Central Bank and Bank of England later
in the session and Friday's U.S. jobs data loomed large.
 Turkish stocks are up 13.7 percent since the beginning of
the year, a reflection of the country's strong recovery and
positive macro-economic outlook.
 Turkish mobile phone provider Turkcell was trading up 1.11
percent at 9.10 lira after the operator reported overnight
second quarter profit of 422 million lira, higher than a
consensus estimate of 415 million lira in a Reuters poll.
 Garanti Bank, Istanbul's most actively traded stock, rose
0.66 percent to 7.60 lira, while Yapi Kredi Bank, which was
expected to release its second quarter earnings on Friday, was
trading down 0.44 percent to 4.54 lira.
 ""Banks may stay under pressure ... as the market is burning
out (from) the second quarter expectations following
announcements from the banks,"" said Ata Invest analyst Mehmet
Ilgen.
 Turkish banks were expected to make another strong showing
in the second quarter due to historically low interest rates,
despite lower savings interest rates, which have cut net
interest income.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - World stocks put in solid gains
and Wall Street looked set of a positive start on Thursday as
investors embraced relatively buoyant economic news ahead of
Friday's key U.S. jobs report.
 Early caution in the face of European Central Bank and Bank
of England meetings dissipated when data showed German
industrial orders data rose 3.2 percent in June, surpassing
expectations thanks to strong foreign demand. [ID:nLDE6740Z1
 An ADP report on Wednesday also added to sentiment, showing
the U.S. adding jobs in July..
 The BoE and ECB both, as expected, left rates on hold.
 A second day of upbeat earnings from Europe's banking sector
saw Germany's Commerzbank raise its outlook after a
forecast-beating second quarter. Barclays of the UK beat
expectations with a 44 percent rise in half-year profit as bad
debts dropped, but it made a big accounting gain, offsetting a
second-quarter slowdown at its investment bank.
 Investors remained cautious, however, about U.S. non-farm
payrolls jobs data due on Friday against the backdrop of an
apparent U.S. economic slowdown, considered a major threat to
the global recovery, even if China and some others can take up
part of the slack.
 ""Corporate earnings will keep helping the market for some
more time, but if macroeconomic numbers are going to take over,
then good earnings will not be enough to support the market,""
said Koen De Leus, economist at KBC Securities.
 ""Nervousness is now about the U.S. jobs data as expectations
of the markets are really linked to these numbers. If they are
better than expected, then concerns of a double dip will fade
very fast. If that's not happening, then we might see a
correction.""
 MSCI's all-country world stock index and the the Thomson
Reuters global stock index gained about 0.4 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 rose 0.5 percent.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.7 percent, helped at
least for a while by top carmaker Toyota Motor Corp reporting
its best operating profit in two years, beating market
estimates, and lifting its cautious forecasts despite a sluggish
U.S. recovery.
 
 EURO FIRMS
 The euro turned higher against the dollar, lifted by a
successful Spanish debt auction and positive comments about
Greece's progress in reducing its deficit from the International
Monetary Fund.
 The currency also benefited from the German data. But the
U.S. jobs data remained a factor.
 ""Trade will probably be choppy going into tomorrow's
payrolls data,"" said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS.
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies
to 80.718, only slightly above its recent low of 80.469, its
weakest since mid-April
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3195.
 Long-term euro zone government bonds were little changed,
but there weas some selling of short-term paper.

(Adds Trichet quotes, detail)
 By Marc Jones and Michele Kambas
 FRANKFURT, Aug 5 (Reuters) - It is too early to declare
victory over the financial crisis despite stronger than expected
data suggesting the euro zone recovery is outstripping
expectations, the European Central Bank said on Thursday.
 The ECB held rates at a record low of 1.0 percent, as
expected, and said it would only decide next month whether to
resume its exit from generous liquidity supplies.
 President Jean-Claude Trichet delivered an upbeat message on
the economy, ruling out a return to recession and saying the
third quarter would be better than expected. But he was also
careful to retain an air of caution.
 ""I do not declare victory,"" Trichet told a news conference,
stressing the recovery was likely to be an uneven process.
 ""The available economic data and survey-based indicators
suggest a strengthening in the economic activity in the second
quarter of 2010 and the available data for the third quarter are
better than expected.""
 With inflation in the 16-country euro zone undershooting and
the region's post-crisis economic recovery still in a delicate
phase, the decision to keep rates at a record low for the 15th
month running was widely expected. 
 Trichet said they remained at an ""appropriate"" level,
bolstering the current consensus that they will stay on hold
well into next year. [ECB/INT]
 ""The ECB remains in wait-and-see mode,"" said Ralf Umlauf,
economist at Helaba. ""There were no signals on a change in
monetary policy, neither did the ECB chief give the impression
that the reins would be loosened again.""
 
 MONEY MARKET IMPROVEMENT
 The ECB earlier gave the thumbs-up to Greece's progress on
repairing its public finances after an official review, a
problem that sparked this year's euro zone debt crisis.
 Trichet declared himself happy with the results of the ECB's
controversial programme of buying government bonds, which has
slowed to a trickle in recent weeks, and said there had been
significant improvement in debt markets.
 Bank-to-bank lending markets had also picked up, he said,
citing the positive reaction to bank stress test results, better
data and reduced fear about sovereign debt markets as the
principle drivers.
 ""The volume in the overall money market has very
significantly augmented; I could say even doubled,"" he said.
 ""It is not a normal situation yet, but it is something which
goes certainly in the right direction as regards to the activity
in the money market.""
 ECB watchers were hoping Trichet might give an early hint on
whether banks would continue to have access to unlimited ECB
cash for the rest of 2010, past the current deadline of October.
 But he said only that the bank would make a decision next
month on any further moves to unwind the extra liquidity it has
been pumping into money markets and would do what is needed.
 Money market rates  are a vital part of the ECB's
current monetary policy strategy. By pumping in extra cash for
banks during the crisis, bank-to-bank charges fell well below
the 1 percent mark suggested by the ECB's benchmark rate.
 Now they are trending up, but Trichet disputed that the ECB
was presiding over a de facto tightening in monetary conditions.
 Asked about the steady rise in three-month interbank rates,
Trichet said: ""I do not welcome it particularly, it's part of
the normalisation of the situation.""

 EURO
 In contrast to U.S. indicators, which suggest post-recession
recovery across the Atlantic may be flagging, data in the
16-nation euro zone has continued to outperform since the ECB's
July meeting.
 The euro zone economy grew by just 0.2 percent in the first
quarter of the year on a quarterly basis. Second quarter figures
are due next week and are expected to show stronger growth after
a string of upbeat forward-looking data in recent weeks.
 The contrast in data has opened a gulf between the ECB and
the Federal Reserve, which along with the Bank of England has
publicly toyed with a return to stronger stimulus. The BoE also
kept rates on hold on Thursday. [ID:nLAC005756]
 The divergence has driven a 10 percent rise in the euro
against the dollar  since early June, a move economists
warn could soon become a drag on the euro zone's recovery.
 Trichet refused to comment on whether the euro's rise could
dent the region's recovery, but said he trusted the Fed's view
of the U.S. economy and warned against a backlash of sentiment.
 ""I would say it would be very premature to draw the very
negative conclusion on the U.S. economy at the moment I am
speaking. We will see what happens.""
 Barclays Capital economist Julian Callow said he saw some
parallels with 2008, when the Fed eased policy yet the ECB
tightened.
 ""In our view, the ECB must be careful that such (update)
comments do not result in significant further euro
appreciation,"" he said.

 * Japan may exit deflation, but getting harder with time
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The risks of the U.S. economy
entering a double-dip recession and falling into deflation may
now be around one in four, the chief executive of PIMCO, the
world's biggest bond investment manager, said on Thursday.
 ""The U.S. is still able to avoid deflation. We do not think
that deflation and double-dip is the baseline scenario, but we
think it's a risk scenario,"" Pacific Investment Management Co.
(PIMCO) Chief Executive and Co-chief Investment Officer Mohamed
El-Erian told reporters.
 The probability of such a risk scenario is about 25 percent,
said El-Erian, who helps oversee more than $1 trillion at PIMCO.
 A recent rally in bond markets in the United States, Japan
and Germany reflects a recognition among market players of what
PIMCO calls the ""new normal"", which refers to a period of muted
growth and disinflation, El-Erian said.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a 15-month low of 2.855
percent in July and the two-year yield hit a record low near 0.52
percent this week.
 In Japan, the 10-year government bond yield fell below 1.0
percent this week for the first time in seven years as a rising
yen reinforced worries about the economy and persistent
deflation.
 While it is not too late for Japan to exit deflation, it
becomes harder every year, El-Erian said.
 Japan could exit deflation by conducting substantive reforms
to the domestic economy, or via a major positive external demand
shock that could come from China, or through a major crisis,
El-Erian said, adding that such outcomes were unlikely in the
next 12 months.
 ""So what we are likely to see is a continuation of the
deflation trap. And ironically, as other countries start risking
deflation, it puts Japan in a more difficult position,"" he said.
 Although there have been brief periods when it gained some
respite, Japan's economy has mostly been stuck in deflation for
more than the last 10 years.

 By David Milliken
 LONDON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The near-certainty that the Bank
of England will not change its monetary policy stance later on
Thursday is likely to conceal a vigorous debate about whether
Britain is at greater risk from slow growth or high inflation.
 The central bank will only issue its usual terse statement
at 1100 GMT, not releasing the updated quarterly inflation
forecasts on which the decision is based until Aug. 11 and
publishing full minutes on Aug. 18.
 The BoE is in a situation with some similarities to mid
2008, when policymakers had to judge if a temporary spike in
inflation would lead to a longer-term rise in prices, or whether
growth threats on the horizon would snuff out price pressures.
 Former British Airways economist Andrew Sentance -- who was
the lone voice calling for higher interest rates in June and
July's meetings -- is likely to feel vindicated by an unexpected
surge in second-quarter GDP which suggests recovery is firmly on
track for now.
 But other policymakers will be more worried about a possible
fall in demand next year when 25 percent spending cuts to the
budgets of many government departments start to take effect and
banks must repay nearly 200 billion pounds of emergency BoE
loans taken out during the credit crunch.
 ""While it is apparent that none of the MPC members are happy
with recent inflation levels, it is also apparent that they
still see downside as well as upside risks to the inflation
outlook,"" said IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer.
 All 61 economists polled last week by Reuters expect rates
to stay unchanged, and most do not see an increase until the
second quarter of next year (http://r.reuters.com/cav33n).
 
 INFLATION REPORT MONTH
 The nine members of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee will
have a quarterly update to the central bank's growth and
inflation forecasts to aid their discussion -- the first since
Britain's new coalition government announced both spending cuts
and another inflationary rise in sales tax for next year.
 Quarterly inflation reports have proven the impetus behind
key BoE policy shifts since the start of the financial crisis,
presaging both the launch of quantitative easing in March 2009
and the end to new gilt purchases in February of this year.
 May's inflation report forecast consumer price inflation
would sink below the central bank's 2 percent target at the
start of 2011 and stay there for the next two-and-a-half years.
 But late last month both BoE Governor Mervyn King and Chief
Economist Spencer Dale said the upcoming Jan. 1 rise in
value-added tax to 20 percent from 17.5 percent will make it
unlikely that inflation -- currently 3.2 percent -- will return
to target until 2012.
 This does not mean King and Dale will be arguing for higher
rates. Tighter policy typically takes more than a year to have
an effect on inflation, making it an ineffective tool to combat
one-off rises in prices.
Moreover, there are signs that growth has probably peaked
and that -- VAT aside -- inflation pressures are easing. July's
services PMI data was the weakest in over a year and the rate of
inflation fell for both input costs and prices charged in the
sector [ID:nLDE67310Y].
 Sterling hit a six-month high against the dollar  on
Tuesday, reducing the cost of imported raw materials and some
finished goods, and consumer confidence is faltering in the face
of tighter fiscal policy.
 Last month's policy meeting included a discussion of looser
policy as well as tightening for the first time since February.
 All this suggests that Sentance is likely to remain in a
minority of one when calling for higher rates, even with the
addition of new MPC member and former think-tank director Martin
Weale, said Capital Economics analyst Vicky Redwood.
 ""Generally it seems that the Committee as a whole thinks
spare capacity will bring down inflation. They still have a few
months' breathing space,"" she said.

 HONG KONG, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged higher on
Thursday after solid corporate earnings, including from Toyota
Motor and chipmaker UMC, and strong U.S. economic data that
lifted the beaten-down dollar.
 The upbeat U.S. reports on the services sector and private
jobs eased some worries about a stumbling economic recovery and
prompted Japanese government bonds (JGB) to pull back from
Wednesday's rally, when yields fell to a seven-year low.
 Data from the Institute for Supply Management showed the
services sector grew at a faster pace than expected in July. In
a separate report, payroll-processing company ADP said private
employers added more jobs in July than forecast.
[ID:nN04224566].
 Strong results from Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> boosted
sentiment and propelled Japan's benchmark Nikkei average
<.N225> 1.2 percent higher, reversing much of Wednesday's 2.1
percent drop when investors worried that a yen rally towards
15-year highs would hit exports.
 Toyota climbed more than 3 percent before losing some steam
after reporting its biggest operating profit in two years and
lifting its forecasts. [ID:nTOE67203Q].
 In Taiwan, United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) <2303.TW>,
the world's second-biggest contract chipmaker, lifted the
market by reporting strong quarterly earnings and an increase
in its 2010 capital spending plans. [ID:nTOE67102N]
 Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield rose from a
7-year low to above 1 percent, with bonds sold on profit-taking
as Tokyo stocks recouped some of the ground they lost a day
earlier and after the dollar rebounded against the yen.
 The dollar rose to 86.29 yen from an eight-month low of
85.32 on Wednesday, moving away from the closely watched level
of 84.81, a 15-year low for the dollar struck in November.
 The dollar index <.DXY> edged up 0.1 percent to 80.983,
putting it back above its 200-day moving average at 80.768.
However, it still needs to get past 81.650 to break a bear
trend of the past seven weeks. Otherwise, it risks falling to
its April low of 80.031.
 The optimism reflected in the U.S. data has offset to some
extent expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve might take further
steps into quantitative easing at its policy meeting next week,
undermining safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and JGBs.
 ""So not only is the services sector - the vast bulk of most
modern economies - expanding, it is doing so at a faster pace,""
said Adam Carr, a senior economist at broker ICAP, referring to
the U.S. data.
 ""Commodities are telling us that this global recovery has
reasonable momentum,"" he said, adding that iron ore prices had
risen around 20 percent in the past month, while copper was up
16 percent and wheat 40 percent.
 Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and
Canadian dollars remained strong.
 The Aussie  hovered around three-month highs against
the dollar and the dollar slipped to its lowest in six weeks
against the Canadian currency .
 On Thursday, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks

(Adds comment, market reaction, background)
 By Mantik Kusjanto
 WELLINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - New Zealand's jobless rate
rose more than expected in the second quarter as jobs were lost
and more people looked for work in the fragile economy,
prompting markets to scale back expectations for more interest
rate hikes this year.
 A rate rise is still expected next month, but analysts now
expect the central bank to hold off on further increases for
the rest of the year.
 A Reuters poll taken last week showed forecasters had
expected a rise in September and one more before year-end.
[NZ/POLL]
 The New Zealand dollar  fell and interest rate
futures rose after data on Thursday showed the economy
unexpectedly lost 6,000 jobs and the work force grew in the
three months to June 30, sending the jobless rate up to 6.8
percent from 6.0 percent in the first quarter.
 The figure was well above economists' forecasts for 6.4
percent in a Reuters poll.
 ""We still expect the Reserve Bank to hike in September, but
beyond that, a pause is a real possibility,"" said ANZ-National
senior economist Khoon Goh.
 Others said the central bank needed to be even more
cautious.
 ""Given this and other soft domestic data flow, and also the
fact that we're seeing global commodity price weakness now, we
believe the RBNZ should be pausing at its next meeting,"" said
Goldman Sachs JBWere economist Philip Borkin.
 Last week, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised
its cash rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent but said further
hikes would probably be more gradual due to a subdued economic
outlook.
 Markets have been lowering expectations of how far and how
fast rates will increase because of the uneven domestic
recovery, which has been dogged by sluggish consumption, a
stagnant housing market, and slowing migration, along with a
softening global outlook.
 On Wednesday, dairy giant Fonterra said it would review the
forecast payout level for farmers in the coming season because
of a fall in world prices over past four months. See
[ID:nSGE67309D]
 Fonterra's moves are closely tracked because the company
generates about 7 percent of the country's economy.
 The job data showed part-time employment fell 1.6 percent,
overshadowing a 0.2 percent rise in full-time jobs growth.
 RATE PAUSE RISK
 Markets now see a 64 percent chance of a rate rise at the
Sept 16 review  compared with a 74 percent chance
before the jobs data.
 Traders also scaled back expectations for total rate rises
over the next 12 months to 72 basis points (bps) from 87 bps
last week.
 The kiwi  fell about 1 percent to a low of $0.7276
from $0.7350 before the data, while the yield on interest rate
futures <0#NBBM:> rose by up to 14 points as investors pared
back rate back rate expectations.
 The sharp drop in the jobless rate in the first quarter to
6.0 percent from a 10-year high of 7.1 percent is now regarded
as a statistical anomaly.
 New Zealand's jobless rate compares with the OECD average
of 8.6 percent and 5.2 percent in Australia.
 The labour market usually lags the broader economy, and
weakness at a time when a recovery is underway and gathering
pace is no surprise.
 The RBNZ started to bring rates back to a more normal level
in June amid expectations that the economic recovery would spur
inflationary pressures.
 It had cut rates to record low 2.5 percent to support the
economy through recession and the global financial crisis.
 Earlier this week, data showed wages grew modestly in the
June quarter, while a survey by the National Bank of NZ last
month showed businesses' hiring intentions falling.

 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan bonds
rallied on Wednesday as optimism about the global economy sent
investors scrambling for higher returns.
 Despite growing threats of military clashes between
Venezuela and neighboring Colombia, intrepid investors have
sought out Venezuelan debt as it offers some of the world's
highest yields.
 ""They're not optimistic about Venezuela, they're optimistic
about external risk,"" said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin
America strategy at RBS.
 Investors bid the price of Venezuela's global bond due 2027
 up 1.375 points to 75.125.
 The risk spread between Venezuelan bonds and their U.S.
equivalents shrank to its narrowest level in almost three
months. The spread narrowed 37 basis points to 1026 basis
points, according to the JPMorgan EMBI+ index <11EMJ>.
 Investors' appetite for riskier assets was boosted by
slightly better-than-expected U.S. jobs and services data.
 That pushed up yields on U.S. Treasuries, which are still
offering paltry gains, and helped narrow the spread on emerging
market bonds across the world.
 Investors have traditionally held short positions in
Venezuelan debt and are now desperately looking for ways out,
Morden said.
 ""As long as it's not going to spiral into a crisis
tomorrow, you strategically have to reduce your shorts just
because spreads would outperform in an environment of risk
appetite,"" she said.
 ""That's the perversity of the situation -- realizing that
(Venezuela) may be spiraling into a disaster but at the same
time buying into it.""
 Political tensions between Venezuela and Colombia are just
""noise"" for now, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note
to clients on Wednesday.
 ""The Venezuelan government's ability and willingness to
take the conflict to a higher 'military' level are low,"" they
wrote.
 Venezuela's socialist President Hugo Chavez cut diplomatic
ties with Colombia on July 22 after it accused his country of
sheltering leftist guerrillas.
 But investors paid little attention. Colombia's peso
 lost only 0.3 percent that day and has since continued
to rally, closing at its strongest level in two years against
the dollar on Wednesday.
 The currency has been strengthening due to huge foreign
investment in the Andean country's mining and energy sectors as
well as dollar inflows to finance government spending.
[ID:nN04259039]
 LATAM CURRENCIES WAVER ON GROWTH OUTLOOK
 The U.S. data helped lift the Mexican peso to a five-week
high and boosted the Chilean peso to its strongest level in
five months.
 The Mexican currency  strengthened 0.56 percent to
12.5125 per dollar, hitting its strongest since late June.
 Fears over slowing U.S. growth have raised concerns
recently about global demand for Latin American exports such as
oil and soy as well as manufacturing goods from countries with
a significant industrial base, such as Mexico and Brazil.
 The Chilean peso  was flat at 516.50 after hitting
its strongest level in nearly five months.
 The peso has been boosted by a rally in copper, the
country's main export, and bets that the central bank could end
up raising rates more than expected as Chile's economy quickly
recovers from a devastating earthquake earlier this year.
 Brazil's real  seesawed before closing 0.11 percent
stronger at 1.756 per dollar on the local spot market.
 The Brazilian currency has underperformed its regional
peers in recent sessions. Bets on a slower pace of rate hikes
as well as concerns over more aggressive central bank
intervention have cooled interest in the real.

 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Global stocks edged higher and
the dollar rebounded from an eight-month low versus the yen on
Wednesday after better-than-expected readings of U.S. and

 U.S. stocks rose in thin trade as retailer earnings and the

show a drop of 65,000.
 ""People still have a lot of concerns about economic growth

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from an
eight-month low against the yen on Wednesday and rose against
the euro as encouraging U.S. employment and service sector data
prompted traders to unwind bets against the U.S. currency.
 A private report showing the economy added 42,000 jobs last
month was welcome, but traders said it would take far more good
news to reverse the prevailing bias against the greenback,
which has shed some 6 percent against major currencies since
July.
 ""The market is still short the dollar, so you could see
some covering between now and the end of the week, but this
would be for the short term,"" said Hidetoshi Yanagihara, senior
currency trader at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. ""It's
obvious the pace of U.S. growth is slowing and people are
waiting to sell the dollar at better levels.""
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar rose 0.5
percent to 86.26 yen after falling to 85.33 yen earlier, its
lowest level since November. A move below 84.81 yen would mark
a 15-year low, according to Reuters data.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.3164, off Tuesday's
three-month high of $1.3261. The dollar was also boosted by
data showing the U.S. services sector grew more than expected
in July.
 The U.S. currency rose 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc
to 1.0522 francs, and sterling fell 0.3 percent to $1.5894.
 Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in New York,
said the reports provided investors with a good incentive to
buy back some dollar. However, she added markets are still
worried recent signs of weaker U.S. growth could prompt the
Federal Reserve to embrace more monetary policy easing.
 The Fed's next policy meeting will be on Aug. 9.
 The fears about the economy have driven U.S. short-dated
Treasury yields lower in recent days, which has undermined the
appeal of dollars for global investors.
 Technical factors are still flashing some warning signals
for the greenback. An index that measures the value of the
dollar against six major currencies had closed for two straight
days beneath its 200-day moving average before rising 0.4
percent on Wednesday.
 Further losses in the index are still likely and a firm
breach of the supports at 80.40 and 79.92, particularly on a
weekly close basis, would suggest a more medium-term downtrend
for the dollar to below 75, according to Reuters and Citibank
data.
 The 80.40-79.2 target area is the convergence of 55-200
week moving averages and horizontal supports for the index.
 ALL EYES ON PAYROLLS
 Lien said a strong showing from the government's more
comprehensive payrolls report to be released on Friday could
cause ""yields to finally stop falling, which is a prerequisite
for the U.S. dollar to bottom.""
 Economists polled by Reuters are looking for Friday's data
to show an overall decline of 65,000 jobs in July but a 90,000
gain in private sector employment.
 Speculation that the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- could
revive a program to buy Treasury and mortgage debt to boost
growth is also likely to cap dollar gains, analysts said.
 ""We see further dollar weakness ahead, with the Fed making
it clear its priority is to support growth,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency analyst at Commerzbank in Europe.

 * Strike by nearly 1 million civil servants due next week
 * Wage hike will strain state budget
 
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 4 (Reuters) - South African officials and
public sector unions failed on Wednesday to reach a wage deal to
head off a strike by nearly 1 million civil servants that could
cripple commerce in the continent's largest economy.
 The government and unions decided to adjourn talks a few
hours ahead of the deadline set by the public services minister
with neither side budging from their positions, union officials
said. They expect to meet again on Thursday.
 The bulk of the unions have threatened to strike next week
but analysts believe a deal will be reached to avert a mass
labour action that could be the biggest civil servants' strike
since a work stoppage three years ago that slammed the economy.
 ""There was no deal reached,"" said Manie De Clerq, spokesman
for Public Servants Association union, whose members downed
tools last week.
 The unions want a raise of 8.6 percent, more than double the
inflation rate, and a housing allowance of 1,000 rand ($137.4).
The government has offered a 6.5 percent wage increase and a
monthly housing allowance of 630 rand.
 Those who have threatened to strike include customs and
immigration officers, police, healthcare workers and teachers.
 Analysts say the ruling African National Congress (ANC),
which has a long-standing alliance with organised labour, is
likely to bend to union demands.
 It does not want to see a long halt in public services,
which could dent support ahead of national elections early next
year for almost all local government posts.

 * Swiss joint venture invests 70 million euros in mall
 * Plans to invest another 80 million euros in two more malls

 By Hamid Ould Ahmed
 ALGIERS, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Swiss investors unveiled
Algeria's first Western-style shopping mall on Wednesday, a
70-million-euro project that marks the first major foray by
foreigners into the energy exporters' untapped retail market.
 Algeria has 35 million people and one of the highest levels
of income per capita in Africa but international retailers have
been put off by curbs on foreign investment and a conflict
between government forces and Islamist rebels.
 A joint venture of Swiss banking group Valartis and Swiss
department store operator Jelmoli financed the shopping mall,
recreation and office complex in the Algerian capital and said
it plans two more worth 80 million euros.
 ""Our presence here confirms that the investment climate is
positive. We have confidence in the authorities, especially in
this sector. That's why we want to continue,"" said Alain
Rolland, Managing Director of Valartis Asset Management.
 ""Contrary to what the foreign media say, the (security)
situation has improved. We should forget the trauma because
there is a new generation now.""
 A supermarket operated by a division of private Algerian
firm Cevital will open at the complex this week, while a
multiplex cinema, shops and a bowling alley are scheduled to
open there later this year.
 The previous attempt by a foreign retailer to break into
Algeria's retail market was when French retailer Carrefour
launched a franchise project with a local partner. It pulled
out at the end of last year.
 
 FEW FOREIGN BRANDS
 Most Algerians shop in small neighbourhood stores or markets
and there are almost no foreign retail brands. Many fast-food
outlets have added the prefix ""Mc"" to their name in a nod to
McDonald's restaurants -- which has no presence in Algeria.
 Rolland, who is also chairman of Societe des Centres
Commerciaux et de Loisirs d'Algerie (SCCA), the joint venture
behind the mall, said it was planning another complex in Algiers
and one in the western Algerian city of Oran.
 ""We have invested around 70 million euros in this project,""
he told Reuters on the sidelines of a presentation on the
complex. ""We plan to build another complex in Oran with an
estimated (cost of) 45 million euros.""
 ""A second one is planned for Algiers with a cost of around
35 million euros because Algiers has the capacity to have a
second complex,"" he said.
 Valartis Group holds a 74 percent stake in the joint venture
while Jelmoli owns the remaining 26 percent, Rolland said.
 The Swiss investors began their project in Algeria four
years ago, as Algeria began to emerge from more than of a decade
of violence that killed an estimated 200,000 people.
 The violence has eased in the past few years after hundreds
of rebels surrendered to the authorities, though al Qaeda-linked
militants mount occasional attacks outside the major cities.
 Investors hoping to capitalise on improving security have,
however, been discouraged by a growing trend towards economic
nationalism. Algerian authorities say measures restricting
foreign investment are intended to protect national interests.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2010 01:52PM ET</span>",Turkish fiscal rule vote may not come in Oct -Simsek," HELSINKI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament may not vote
on a fiscal-reform bill seen as vital to Ankara's push for an
investment-grade rating when it reconvenes in October, Finance
Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Wednesday.
 The so-called fiscal rule aimed at cutting Turkey's budget
deficit and debt will be helpful but is not essential since the
government is acting consistently with its targets and is on
track for this year's deficit-reduction target, Simsek said.
 ""It's very important for us to strengthen our fiscal
credibility. We have not given up (on the fiscal rule); the
commitment is still there,"" Simsek told a news conference in
Helsinki, where he was meeting members of the business
community.
 ""Hopefully, it will be revisited at some point.""
 The new law, due to take effect in 2011 if approved by
parliament, is intended to cut the budget deficit to 1 percent
of gross domestic product in 10 years, and debt to about 30
percent of GDP in five to 10 years.
 In 2009, the deficit stood at 5.5 percent of GDP, and debt
was 45.5 percent of GDP.
 ""We have been operating under an implicit fiscal rule,""
Simsek told a news conference in Helsinki, where he was meeting
members of the business community. 
 ""Whether or not fiscal rule gets adopted or not by our
parliament in October, it will not make a big difference,""
Simsek said.
 Simsek said Turkey was slightly ahead of plan to meet its
target of cutting its budget deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP this
year. ""Our 2010 performance so far is even better than what
we've been targeting.""
 Turkey is enjoying a solid economic recovery helped by
government stimulus spending and low interest rates.
 The International Monetary Fund has forecast that economic
growth in Turkey will exceed 6 percent this year, a sharp
rebound after a contraction of 4.7 percent last year.
 The Turkish lira  hit a three-month high against the
dollar this week. It has since weakened again after
disappointing recent U.S. data hurt risk appetite, making
investors warier of emerging markets such as Turkey.
 In answer to a question about the effect of the strong lira
on Turkey's current-account deficit, Simsek said: ""I'm convinced
that in the medium to long term Turkey will manage to narrow its
deficit.""
 ""In the short term, I think Turkish deficit at around 4
percent of GDP is financeable.""

 By Glenn Somerville and Kim Dixon
 WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The Bush administration's
""misguided"" policies are to blame for huge U.S. budget
deficits, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner charged on
Wednesday as he sought to build an election-year case for
ending tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
 With congressional elections looming in November, Geithner
sought to regain the high ground on the issue of who bears
responsibility for record budget gaps and to counter Republican
labeling of Democrats as tax-and-spend, bailout-happy
liberals.
 Geithner said extending the Bush-era tax cuts for top
income earners, as Republicans want, would force more borrowing
to cover lost revenues and crimp more-effective remedies for
boosting economic growth and hiring.
 ""Borrowing to finance tax cuts for the top 2 percent would
be a $700 billion fiscal mistake,"" Geithner said. ""It's not the
prescription the economy needs now, and the country can't
afford it.""
 With the economic recovery showing signs of slowing and
unemployment at a lofty 9.5 percent, President Barack Obama's
popularity has taken a heavy hit and Democrats on Capitol Hill
are at risk of losing their majorities in the Senate and the
House of Representatives.
 The U.S. budget gap, which hit a record $1.41 trillion in
fiscal 2009 and is poised to grow wider this year, has unnerved
many Americans. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found
that 44 percent of registered voters rank the deficit as an
extremely important issue in deciding how to vote.
 HOT BUTTON POLITICS
 The debate over the tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire
at the end of this year, has grown hotter in recent weeks.
 President Barack Obama and most Democrats want to extend
the tax cuts only for individuals making less than $200,000, or
families earning less than $250,000 -- about 97 percent of all
Americans.
 Republicans argue the recovery would be jeopardized if all
the cuts are not extended, a concern some Democrats share.
 ""We look forward to the debate about raising taxes in the
middle of a recession,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch
McConnell said on Tuesday.
 Geithner argued that better use could be made of the money
that would otherwise flow into the government's coffers. ""If
people think there's a good case now for more stimulus for the
economy, then we should have the debate about what's the best
form of stimulus,"" he said.
 Congress must take action to extend any part of the tax
cuts. If the top rates expire, they would revert to 36 percent
and 39.6 percent from 33 percent and 35 percent. Dividend tax
rates would also rise from 15 percent to 40 percent with no
action, a key source of stress among investors.
[ID:nN13219477]
 Another senior Treasury Department official said on
Wednesday that the department is assuming Congress will let the
tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire. The Treasury
estimates doing so would reap an extra $37 billion a year and
it already is setting its borrowing plans on the assumption
that will happen. [ID:nN04235372]
 ""FALSE PROSPERITY""
 Geithner, speaking to the liberal Center for American
Progress and the right-leaning American Action Forum, harked
back to the former Clinton administration's record of budget
surpluses in the late 1990s, contrasting it with the succeeding
Bush administration that he said ran up huge debts and caused
Americans' incomes to stagnate with few jobs created.
 ""We are living today with the damage that misguided policy
caused,"" he said, adding that the country needed to choose a
new course. ""Rather than recreating a false prosperity fueled
by debt and passing the bills on to the next generation, we
need to restore America to a pro-growth tax and fiscal
policy.""
 Geithner has spent much of the year pushing for a broad
overhaul of U.S. financial rules. With a regulatory revamp now
signed into law, he has turned to bolstering the Obama
administration's case for its policies.
 Global investors are closely monitoring U.S. efforts to
rein in budget deficits. The administration has said it is
important to maintain near-term support for the economy but
that a long-term plan to get deficits under control is needed.
 Obama has charged a commission with coming up with a plan
by December 1 to bring the U.S. budget into better balance.

 * Euro rally to end in next few weeks
 * Euro to peak at $1.35
 * First upgrade to euro forecasts this year
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The euro's recent rally against
the dollar will soon reverse as fiscal tightening and weak
economic growth plague the common currency, the latest Reuters
poll of foreign exchange analysts predicted.
 The poll of around 60 analysts, taken August 2-4, predicted
the euro would be worth just $1.20 in a year's time -- not far
from the four-year lows of below $1.19 seen in June and well
below Tuesday's three-month high of $1.3262.
 Median forecasts predicted the common currency would trade
at $1.30 in one month and 1.25 in three months, before falling
to $1.24 in six months' time. Twelve-month forecasts were in a
relatively wide range of $1.05-$1.38, highlighting uncertainty
in the market.
 This is the first time this year euro forecasts have been
upgraded but is on the whole little changed from last month's
poll, with analysts seeing the euro peaking at around $1.35 in
the next few weeks before it begins to sink again.
 ""The tougher fiscal tightening in Europe and dire growth
outlook could soon bring headwinds to the euro. Hence, the
current uptrend in EUR/USD should run out of momentum soon,""
said Niels Christensen at Nordea.
 In the second half of last year the euro zone economy
emerged from its worst post-war recession, and grew 0.2 percent
in the first three months of 2010 but is expected to do little
more than tick over in coming quarters.
 The economy was boosted by ultra-loose fiscal policy from
the European Central Bank but governments are now faced with the
financial headache of having to slash budgets to recoup the cost
of the bail-out while preventing a slide back into recession.
 The U.S. economy bounced back more strongly and recent
evidence of a stubbornly weak labour market and a cooling off in
manufacturing and services business activity has done little to
dent forecasts for 2.8 percent annual growth next year.
 ""We don't believe the downside surprises in U.S. economic
data will continue. The euro should hold its levels and weaken
from here on out,"" said Raghav Subbarao at Barclays Capital.
 The slow economic recovery of the euro zone and intensifying
austerity measures mean the ECB is not expected to raise rates
from their record low of 1.0 percent until the third quarter of
2011. The U.S. Federal Reserve is still expected to start
raising rates early next year.
 Against sterling, the euro is forecast to lose ground as the
Bank of England is expected to tighten in the second quarter of
next year, unwinding its loose monetary policy slightly sooner
than the ECB.
 Cross rates calculated by Reuters show the euro trading at
83 pence in one month then dropping to 81p in six months where
it will stay until next August at least.
 That compares to respective 83p, 81p and 80p forecasts in
the July poll.
 ""With the ECB and the BoE staying put way into 2011, it will
continue to be a balancing act between the euro and sterling,""
Christensen said.
 The British economy is seen faring better than the euro
zone's, growing 1.2 percent this year and 2.0 percent next,
outstripping forecasts for 1.1 and 1.2 percent growth
respectively in the bloc.
 As risk aversion subsides, the euro was seen gaining a
little ground versus the yen, having slumped to an 8-1/2 year
low against the Japanese currency in June. It was expected to
strengthen to be worth 116.1 yen in 12 months' time from the
112.8 it was trading at earlier on Wednesday.
 Euro volatility against the dollar was seen rising over the
coming month. Analysts say the divergence of forecasts in
Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator of exchange
rate volatility in the following month.

 * Strategists scale back forecasts for sterling depreciation
 * Austerity, weak demand seen as headwinds for GBP
 * Pound seen at $1.50 in 12 months, to strengthen vs euro
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The pound will depreciate against
the dollar more slowly than thought a month ago, according to a
monthly Reuters poll of 60 strategists who upgraded their short
and long-term forecasts for the second survey running.
 After news last month the UK economy grew at its fastest
pace in four years in the second quarter, respondents upped
their median one-, three- and six-month sterling/dollar
forecasts by around four to five cents each.
 But the overall trend was still one of modest sterling
depreciation, as fiscal austerity measures and worrying signs of
weak domestic demand are expected to temper recovery from
Britain's worst post-war recession.
 ""In light of a mixed bag of domestic news sterling is
unlikely to sustain the recent positive run,"" said Niels
Christensen of Nordea.
 ""Slower growth is waiting down the road and is bound to make
life a little difficult for sterling during the autumn.""
 Foreign exchange strategists saw the pound slipping to $1.53
in three months, $1.51 in six and $1.50 in a year's time,
compared to equivalent median forecasts of $1.47, $1.46 and
$1.49 in the July poll.
 Not all respondents thought sterling would depreciate
against the dollar. Seventeen saw sterling at or higher than its
current level around $1.59 in 12 months' time.
 ""Sterling should continue to outperform the other FX majors
mostly in the wake of the tough UK emergency budget and better
data at home,"" said Roberto Mialich of UniCredit MIB.
 ""Cable should progressively head towards the 1.60 area in
the medium term,"" he added.

 GROWING PAINS
 The UK economy's surprising growth of 1.1 percent in the
second quarter -- nearly twice as strong as the market consensus
-- scuppered the July poll's one-month forecast of $1.50.
 On Wednesday, cable traded at around $1.59, bolstered by
strong earnings at British banks and broad dollar weakness
induced by clear signs the U.S. recovery is slowing.
 The prospects for Britain's economy over the coming quarters
also look uncertain.
 A purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey on Wednesday
showed Britain's dominant services sector grew at its slowest
rate in 13 months in July, marked by slowing growth of new
orders and a return to job cuts.
 The Bank of England's August rate-setting meeting also began
on Wednesday and the latest PMI data are unlikely to convince
policymakers to start hiking interest rates from their record
low 0.5 percent soon, despite strong second-quarter growth.
 ""Technically we think GBP/USD is overbought and due for some
profit taking as the BoE reiterates that the economy still faces
significant challenges from public expenditure cutbacks and
credit rationing,"" said Kenneth Broux of Lloyds Banking Group.
 Strategists retained their forecasts for modest sterling
appreciation against the euro. They saw the euro weakening
slightly from current levels around 83 pence to 80.5 pence in a
year's time.
 Like Britain, economic data in the euro zone surprised
largely to the upside last month, but economists see the
16-nation bloc's economy underperforming the United States and
UK as austerity measures intensify and domestic demand weakens.

 The latest poll also revealed an expectation that cable
trade would be slightly less volatile this month, based on
calculations derived from the standard deviation of forecasts.
 It implied annualised sterling volatility easing to 9.5
percent in August, from an actual 10.6 percent in July.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The dollar neared a 15-year low
against the yen on Wednesday on fears the Federal Reserve could
embrace more monetary easing to jolt a faltering recovery but
it recouped its losses on better-than-expected U.S. jobs data.
 Data showing U.S. private employers added more jobs than
expected in July helped the dollar recover lost ground against
the Japanese currency and also slowed recent gains in the euro,
which hit a three-month high on Tuesday.
 But with mounting signs of slower U.S. growth, analysts
said markets will likely require more good news to reverse the
steady dollar selling that's prevailed in recent weeks.
 ""The market really needed to see an improvement in U.S.
data ... That is allowing for dollar strength,"" said Jessica
Hoversen, fixed income and currency strategist at MF Global in
Chicago. But she said ""we need to see better U.S. data and weak
European data for the dollar to rally.""
 The dollar was last at 85.77 yen, flat on the day, off a
session low of 85.33. The euro was off 0.2 percent at $1.3200
but still near Tuesday's high of $1.3261, its strongest level
since May.
 Reuters service IFR noted a large $1.3400 expiry, in the
region of 1 billion euros, set to roll off on Friday.
 ADP Employment Services said the U.S. private sector added
42,000 jobs in July, a bit more than economists had expected,
and revised upward June's new job tally.
 But if the government's more comprehensive payrolls report
disappoints investors on Friday, the market could be in for
more dollar selling, especially with markets speculating that
the Fed could even try to boost growth by reviving direct
purchases of government and mortgage debt.
 That has helped drive short-dated U.S. Treasury yields to
record lows and blunt the dollar's yield advantage over other
currencies.
 ""We see further dollar weakness ahead, with the Fed making
it clear its priority is to support growth,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency analyst at Commerzbank in Europe.
 YEN STRENGTH WORRISOME FOR JAPAN
 All of that could spell trouble for Japanese policymakers,
who have watched warily as the yen approaches a 15-year low
beneath 84.81, a level touched last November.
 Traders said a move below there could open the way for a
slide to the all-time low beneath 80 yen. Hefty options
barriers are thought to be set around 85 yen, meaning a breach
could accelerate the dollar's fall.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda appeared to ramp
up the administration's verbal warnings, saying current moves
in the yen were somewhat one-sided.
 ""Excessive and disorderly currency moves would negatively
affect stability in the economy and financial markets, and
therefore it's undesirable. In this regard I am closely
watching market moves further,"" he added.
 The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield slid
to a seven-year low below 1.0 percent on worries about the
economy and persistent deflation.
 Analysts said it would be difficult, however, for Japanese
authorities to step in to weaken the yen at this stage,
particularly if the Fed does expand monetary policy easing.

Timothy Geithner on Wednesday blamed ""misguided"" Bush
administration policies for running up huge fiscal deficits and
called for an end to tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
Striking a note of austerity in prepared remarks to a
conference sponsored by the Center for American Progress and
the American Action Forum, Geithner said extending tax cuts for
those making over $250,000 a year will only add to deficits.
""Borrowing to finance tax cuts for the top two percent would
be a $700-billion fiscal mistake,"" he said in speech excerpts
released by the U.S. Treasury ahead of the address later on
Wednesday. ""It's not the prescription the economy needs now,
and the country can't afford it.""
Ahead of November's U.S. congressional elections, President
Barack Obama's Democratic party is struggling to maintain its
support as the economic recovery slows with unemployment high.
Geithner harked back to the former Clinton administration's
record of posting surpluses in the late 1990s, contrasting it
with the succeeding Bush administration that he said ran up
huge debts, caused Americans' incomes to stagnate with few jobs
created.
""We are living today with the damage that misguided policy
caused,"" Geithner said, adding that country needed to choose a
new course.
""Rather than recreating a false prosperity fueled by debt
and passing the bills on to the next generation, we need to
restore America to a pro-growth tax and fiscal policy,"" he
said.
It was Geithner's second major address of the week,
following his trip to Wall Street on Monday to urge big banks
to step up and make more loans, while pledging not to pile new
rules on top of old during the implementation of a financial
regulatory overhaul.
Tax cuts that were put in place during the Bush
administration are scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
Republicans have been making a case for extending them by
saying that not doing so would effectively mean a tax increase
that might further hobble a soft recovery from recession.
Geithner has argued that ending the cuts for those earning
over $250,000 -- while extending them for those who make less
-- would only affect one or two percent of Americans.
Global investors are closely monitoring U.S. efforts to rein
in budget deficits for fear that failing to do so might hurt
the country's ability to keep borrowing and to expand output.
Geithner said on Tuesday in an New York Times editorial that
the U.S. economy was healing but conceded it ""has a long way to
go before reaching its full potential.""
He also said the effects of the deep recession that followed
the 2007-2009 financial crisis were a lingering burden that
needed to be dealt with in order to spur more vigorous growth.
""We have a long way to go to address the fiscal trauma and
damage across the country, and we will need to monitor the ups
and downs in the economy month by month,"" Geithner wrote.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The dollar neared a 15-year low
against the yen on Wednesday, staying under pressure across the
board as weak U.S. data and talk of further policy easing by the
Federal Reserve weighed on Treasury yields.
 Data on Tuesday showed U.S. home purchase contracts tumbled
to a record low in June while factory orders fell more steeply
than expected, implying an anaemic economic recovery for the
remainder of this year. [ID:nN03184274]
 The numbers added to talk that the Fed might start a new
round of Treasuries buying to pump funds into the economy.
 As the yen rose near highs last seen in 1995, Japanese
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda appeared to ramp up the
administration's verbal warnings, saying current moves in the
yen were somewhat one-sided.
 ""Excessive and disorderly currency moves would negatively
affect stability in the economy and financial markets, and
therefore it's undesirable. In this regard I am closely watching
market moves further,"" he added. [ID:nTKX006924]
 But analysts said it would be difficult for Japanese
authorities to step in to weaken the yen at this stage.
 Weak U.S. data and speculation of Fed easing pushed down
U.S. two-year Treasury yields  to a record low of 0.52
percent on Tuesday, suggesting limited upside for the dollar. 
 ""We see further dollar weakness ahead, with the Fed making
it clear its priority is to support growth,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency analyst at Commerzbank.
 The dollar fell as far as 85.32 yen, its lowest since late
November, and was trading at 85.42  at 1100 GMT, down 0.4
percent on the day. Traders said a decline beyond the 15-year
low of 84.82 yen hit in November could open the way for the
dollar to slide to the all-time low below 80 yen.
 Hefty options barriers are thought to be set around 85 yen,
meaning a drop in the dollar could pick up speed below that
level.

(Adds details on economy, comment, currency) 
 BUCHAREST, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank left its
main interest rate unchanged at 6.25 percent on Wednesday, in
line with expectations it would wait for more data to assess the
impact of a tax hike on inflation and an economic recovery.
 Romania's international lenders extended a 20 billion euro
bailout programme on Wednesday, reassuring investors spooked by
the country's deep recession, though it may face tougher
compliance hurdles in future.
 To comply with terms of the International Monetary Fund-led
package, Romania slashed public sector salaries by 25 percent
and raised value added tax by five percentage points, which is
expected to push inflation sharply higher.
 The central bank has to balance that inflation outlook with
the need to bolster the stuttering economy, which shrank by more
than 7 percent last year and is still stuck in recession.
 ""It shows that monetary policy remained prudent. I don't see
tightening happening this year,"" said Melania Hancila, chief
economist at Volksbank in Bucharest.
 ""The trend is of relaxation and we can see that the central
bank lets liquidity in the market.""
 The central bank also said it would maintain the current
level of minimum foreign exchange reserve requirement for banks,
which some analysts had expected to be cut to inject more
liquidity into the system and ease pressure on the leu currency.
 The leu was little changed after the decision and was
trading down 0.3 percent on the day at 4.25 per euro by 1047
GMT.
 All analysts polled by Reuters last week expected the
central bank to leave borrowing costs flat at a record low for
the second meeting in a row following 400 basis points worth of
easing since the start of last year.

(Adds details throughout)
 By Michelle Chen and Kelvin Soh
 HONG KONG, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Hang Seng Bank Ltd expects total
yuan deposits in Hong Kong to jump by a third this year,
following China's latest push to internationalise its currency, a
senior executive said.
 The bank, majority owned by HSBC Holdings Plc, expected total
yuan deposits in the city, the main offshore laboratory used by
Beijing in its internationalisation drive, to rise to 120 billion
yuan ($17.6 billion) by year-end from 89.7 billion yuan now,
General Manager Andrew Fung told Reuters in an interview on
Wednesday.
 ""For Hong Kong to become a real offshore trading centre for
the yuan, companies must come in and take the lead, with trade
settlements being key,"" Fung said. ""Yuan deposits should hit 120
billion yuan by the end of this year, with much of that coming
from companies.""
 Estimates for yuan deposits in Hong Kong vary, with Bank of
East Asia Ltd saying it expected about 100 billion yuan by the
end of 2010.
 The bank was also looking to companies from key export
nations such as Australia and Japan to use its yuan settlement
services, as this was where the most foreign exchange risk
occurred, he said.
 Fung said he expected more customers from countries that do
business with China to start using yuan trade settlement services
in Hong Kong in the next one or two months.
 ""Australia, Japan, South America and other resource-producing
regions are the places where we're going to be pushing such
services,"" he said.
 China last month eased rules on the sale of yuan-backed
financial products in Hong Kong, and gave banks and financial
institutions greater access to yuan funds as part of the
country's long-term strategy to internationalise the currency.
 The yuan loan-to-deposit ratio in Hong Kong was lopsided,
with few investment options and borrowers for the yuan being kept
with the bank, Fung said.
 As such, channels for the yuan to be repatriated back to the
mainland must be set up to increase money supply in Hong Kong as
this would give banks the means to invest the money and pay out
interest.
 ""I've collected the money from a saver, and right now there's
nowhere to invest it,"" he said. ""It's only when yuan trade
becomes more widely accepted in Hong Kong that we don't need that
channel to repatriate the money back to China.""

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The euro zone's dominant service
sector picked up speed last month, a survey showed on Wednesday,
allaying fears of a double dip recession, but strong growth in
Germany and France masked weakness in southern Europe.
 Markit said its final Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers'
Index of around 2,000 companies, ranging from banks to hotels,
rose to 55.8 in July from June's 55.5, showing a slight downward
revision from a preliminary estimate of 56.0.
 The upturn was driven by Germany, Europe's largest economy,
although growth there was not as strong as initially estimated
and, worryingly for policymakers, there is a growing divide
between euro zone economies. Italy's service sector shrank after
seven months of growth while in Spain the pace of growth
stumbled.
 Analysts say euro zone growth, so far boosted mainly by
exports, will not become self-sustaining without a rebound in
consumer spending which has in turn been hold back by
unemployment, stuck near 12-year highs.
 Official euro zone retail trade figures released on
Wednesday showed consumer spending remained soft in June.
 ""There is a worry about the divergence. The countries on the
periphery will suffer more,"" said Silvio Peruzzo, economist at
RBS. ""The market could question the ability of the periphery to
find its way through.""
 In Germany, the PMI showed services activity grew at its
fastest pace in nearly three years, while business in
neighbouring France picked up at close to May's 44-month high.
 But while Germany's reading of 56.5 was higher than June's
54.8 it was well below a flash estimate of 57.3 given late last
month.
 In the euro zone's major trading partner, Britain, service
sector business grew at its slowest pace in 13 months, with its
index dropping to 53.1, way off forecasts and June's 54.4.
 Although this is the eleventh month that the euro zone's
main index has been above the PMI's 50 level that divides growth
from contraction, firms cut prices to attract customers.
The euro zone services output price index remained
stubbornly below the break-even mark for the 21st month at 47.9,
although up from June's 47.4, as firms continued to chop prices
to attract business.
 ""Companies still feel that they have limited pricing power
and have to price competitively to gain business. Input prices
rose at the slowest rate for three months in July but this still
meant that service companies' margins were squeezed,"" said
Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.
 
 COMPOSITE CONFIDENT
 Even so, the composite PMI index, made up from the services
and Monday's manufacturing sector numbers and often used to
predict overall growth, rose to 56.7 this month from 56.0 in
June, in line with flash estimates.
 ""The euro zone economic recovery remained very much on track
as we move into the second half of 2010,"" Chris Williamson at
Markit said, adding that gross domestic product (GDP) growth ""is
probably running at a quarterly rate of 0.7 percent, the best
for three years.""
 The composite employment index, which turned positive in
May, jumped to 51.4 last month from June's 50.6, its highest
reading since April 2008.
 Euro zone unemployment held steady at 10 percent for the
fourth month running in June, adding to evidence that the
16-nation bloc has recovered from its worst recession in
decades.
 The euro zone economy grew 0.2 percent between January and
March after a 0.1 percent expansion in the final three months of
2009.
 The latest Reuters poll estimated that it grew a healthier
0.6 percent in the second quarter but saw slower growth of just
0.3 percent per quarter through to the middle of next year.

 The economy is seen growing 1.3 percent next year, compared
to 2011 forecasts for 2.0 percent in major trading partner
Britain and 2.8 percent for the United States, the world's
biggest economy.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Global shares fell and the dollar
headed towards a 15-year low against the yen on Wednesday as
recent weak U.S. data sparked concerns about the U.S. economic
outlook and talk of more monetary easing by the Federal Reserve.
 Data on Tuesday showed U.S. home purchase contracts tumbled
to a record low, while factory orders fell more steeply than
expected, implying an anaemic recovery. [ID:nN03184274]
 U.S equity futures  pointed to a lower open on
Wall Street ahead of U.S. ADP national employment data and the
Institute for Supply Management's July non-manufacturing index
later in the day. 
 More weak numbers could spark jitters ahead of key U.S.
payrolls data on Friday, putting the dollar under more pressure.
 ""There's a fear of the future at the moment. People are
worrying about how bad things are going to get,"" said Mic Mills,
head of electronic trading at ETX Capital.
 ""Bond yields are at incredible levels, particularly when
10-year yields are being hit like this - that's saying there is
no growth coming through"".
 Concern about the U.S. economy and persistent Japanese
deflation, reinforced by a rising yen, sent 10-year Japanese
government bond yields  to a seven-year low below 1.0
percent, while U.S. two-year yields  were near record
lows.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.3
percent, while European shares lost ground, with the
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> down 0.5 percent.
 
 DOLLAR FALLS VS YEN
 The dollar fell to an eight-month low versus the Japanese
yen  of 85.32 yen on Wednesday, opening up the path
towards 15-year lows below 84.82 yen.
 Against a basket of major currencies <.DXY>, the dollar was
steady, staying close to a three-and-a-half-month low hit on
Tuesday.
 ""We see further dollar weakness ahead with the Fed making it
clear its priority is to support growth,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency analyst at Commerzbank.
 U.S. worries also encouraged stock market participants to
take profits. Earnings releases from Lloyds Banking Group
 and Societe Generale  were strong, but these
were partly offset by downbeat results from Allied Irish Banks
 and Standard Chartered .
 ""Economic data in the U.S. has been pointing towards a
slowing economy and while earnings have been better than
expected, there are worries about the future. It is not the full
support the market needs,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment
strategist at NCB Stockbrokers, in Dublin.
 The drop in Japanese government bond yields and U.S. growth
worries pushed European bond prices higher, with September Bund
futures  rising to their highest in more than two weeks,
helped by softer-than-expected UK services activity data.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield stayed near a record
low just above 0.52 percent set on Tuesday.
 Softer appetite for assets such as stocks and hopes for a
rise in Asian demand helped gold prices  rally to their
highest in more than a week, though a dearth of safe-haven
demand capped gains.
 Oil fell for the first day in five as a rally that powered
prices to three-month highs near $83 on Tuesday lost steam. U.S.
crude oil  fell 30 cents to $82.25.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The dollar neared a 15-year low
against the yen on Wednesday and stayed subdued across the
board, as weak U.S. data and talk of further policy easing from
the Federal Reserve pushed down Treasury yields.
 Data on Tuesday showed U.S. home purchase contracts tumbled
to a record low in June, while factory orders fell more steeply
than expected, implying an anaemic economic recovery for the
remainder of this year.
 The data also kept alive talk that the Fed might start a new
round of Treasuries purchases to pump funds into the economy, as
it did during a recent quantitative easing campaign.
 On the back of weak data and the Fed speculation, U.S.
two-year Treasury note yields on Tuesday fell to a record low,
suggesting limited upside for the dollar.
 ""We see further dollar weakness ahead with the Fed making
it clear its priority is to support growth,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency analyst at Commerzbank.
 The dollar fell as far as 85.32 yen, its lowest since late
November, and was trading at 85.47 at 0750 GMT, down 0.4 percent
on the day. Traders said a decline beyond a November low of
84.82 yen could open the way for the dollar to slide to an
all-time low below 80 yen, hit 15 years ago.
 Hefty options barriers are seen set around 85 yen, meaning a
drop in the dollar could pick up speed below that level.
 But traders doubt the Bank of Japan will step in to weaken
the yen against the dollar.
 ""The market believes the BOJ has their hands tied with
regards to intervention,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of
the foreign securities department at Okasan Securities.
 ""The yen is not yet very strong against other currencies
besides the dollar, leaving the BOJ little to justify such
action with.""
 Japanese yields also fell on Wednesday, as the benchmark
10-year Japanese government bond yield slid to a seven-year low
below 1.0 percent on worries about the economy and persistent
deflation.
 Traders said this knocked risk sentiment in Asia, as the
Nikkei closed with losses of over 2 percent.
 
 EURO BIDS
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against major currencies, was little changed at 80.609, after
closing for the first time since January below its 200-day
moving average, today coming in at 80.744.
 The index is threatening to revisit April lows at 80.031,
while support lies at 79.724, the 61.8 percent retracement of
its November to June rally.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade to $1.3210
, remaining within sight of a three-month high of $1.3262
reached on trading platform EBS on Tuesday.
Traders reported strong bids in the $1.3200 region from
Middle East accounts, while a large option expiry was set to
roll off at $1.3250 at 1400 GMT.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - A recovery in the euro zone's
dominant service sector picked up speed last month, a survey
showed on Tuesday, allaying fears of a double dip recession as
Germany grew strongly though parts of southern Europe struggled.
 Markit said its final Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers'
Index of around 2,000 companies, ranging from banks to hotels,
rose to 55.8 in July from June's 55.5, showing a slight downward
revision from a preliminary estimate of 56.0.
 This marks the eleventh month the index has been above the
50 level that divides growth from contraction, but firms were
forced to cut prices to attract customers.
 The upturn was driven by Germany, Europe's largest economy,
where services activity grew at its fastest pace in nearly three
years, while neighbouring France saw activity pick up at close
to May's 44-month high.
 Offsetting this, Italy saw its sector return to contraction
after seven months of growth while in Spain the pace of growth
tapered off.
 ""The overall outlook for the region is therefore buoyed by
these headline numbers, suggesting a double dip recession will
be avoided as the recovery becomes self-sustaining,"" said Chris
Williamson at data provider Markit.
The euro zone service sector's output price index remained
stubbornly below the break-even mark for the 21st month at 47.9,
although up from June's 47.4, as firms continued to chop prices
to attract business.

(Add background, quotes)
 BEIJING, Aug 4 (Reuters) - China is considering introducing
new foreign exchange instruments to meet domestic market demand
and complement currency reforms launched in June, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange said on Wednesday.
 In a statement on its website laying out its work programme
for the second half of 2010, the currency regulator also said it
would push forward selective capital account reforms in key
areas. In doing so, it would make sure any risks were
manageable.
 China maintains capital controls that, though not
watertight, are largely effective in preventing money from
flowing freely in and out of China. The yuan may be exchanged
for trade and direct investment purposes but not for purely
financial transactions.
 SAFE, which did not say what reforms it has in mind, has
been gingerly easing some restrictions.
 In April, the agency started to allow Chinese residents to
buy foreign exchange from banks online within permitted limits.
 Yi Gang, the head of SAFE, said in a recent interview that
China would eventually make the yuan fully convertible but had
no timetable for doing so.
 It would take China longer than others to open its capital
account, Yi said. Most countries usually take less than a decade
once they have opened their current account.
 ""But China is big with unbalanced development, and the issue
is more complicated here, and it is more difficult for China to
seek consensus,"" Yi said. [ID:nTOE66T07N]
 A blizzard of commentaries by senior central bankers,
including Yi, show that China is moving closer to opening its
capital account, the China Securities Journal said in a
front-page story on Wednesday. [ID:nTOE67300I]
 For the second half of 2010, SAFE said it would keep a tight
grip on ""hot money"" inflows, enhance guidance given to market
makers and improve the currency composition and asset mix of
China's $2.45 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - The dollar hit an eight-month trough
against the yen on Wednesday, crawling towards its lowest level
since 1995, as weak U.S. data and talk of the Federal Reserve
embarking on further policy easing pushed down Treasury yields.
 The dollar fell as low as 85.32 yen, its lowest since late
November before inching back to 85.39, down 0.5 percent on the
day. A fall below a November low of 84.82 yen would take the pair
to its lowest level in 15 years.
 Hefty options barriers are seen set around 85 yen, meaning a
drop in the dollar could pick up speed below that level.
 Traders said a decline beyond the November level could open
the way for the greenback to slide to an all-time low below 80
yen, hit 15 years ago.
 Many now believe it is only a matter of time before the
dollar posts a 15-year low, given the difference between U.S. and
Japanese authorities' stances in their foreign exchange policies,
analysts and traders said.
 ""The biggest reason the dollar has fallen this much against
the yen is that the United States clearly wants a weaker dollar,""
said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking.
 ""Washington wants a weaker dollar as it would help the
economy avoid deflation.""
 Some market players are speculating the Fed could further
relax its policy at an August 10 meeting.
 Meanwhile, traders doubt the Bank of Japan will adopt
additional steps to further ease it policy at an Aug 9-10
meeting.
 ""The market believes the BOJ has their hands tied with
regards to intervention,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of
the foreign securities department at Okasan Securities.
 ""The yen is not yet very strong against other currencies
besides the dollar, leaving the BOJ little to justify such action
with.""
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against major currencies, was little changed at 80.630, remaining
below its 200-day moving average, now at 80.744.
 It fell as low as 80.469 the previous day, dropping below its
200-day moving average for the first time since January, which
analysts said signals further falls.
 The index is threatening to revisit April lows at 80.031,
while support lies at 79.724, the 61.8 percent retracement of its
November to June rally.
 Investors were on watch for comments from Japanese
authorities, although most think currency intervention is
unlikely before dollar/yen breaks the 15 year-low.
 Japan's finance minister reiterated on Wednesday that he is
closely watching currency moves.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade to $1.3213,
remaining within sight of a three-month high of $1.3262 reached
on trading platform EBS on Tuesday.
 Players have become more comfortable about picking up the
single European currency after it earlier this week broke above
$1.3125, a 23.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its decline from
November to June. Some now say the euro is likely to extend its
gains to the 50 percent retracement around $1.3510.
 Stronger growth in Europe and Asia have given rise to the
view that central banks in those regions could raise interest
rates before the Fed.
 Data on Tuesday showed U.S. home purchase contracts tumbled
to a record low in June, while factory orders fell steeper than
expected, implying an anemic economic recovery for the remainder
of this year.
 The data also kept alive talk that the Fed might start a new
round of Treasuries purchases to pump funds into the economy, as
it did during a recent quantitative easing campaign.
 On the back of weak data and the Fed speculation, U.S.

 Talk of further Fed easing prompted investors to cut their
dollar exposure, pushing the U.S. currency as low as 85.32 yen

 A fall below a November low of 84.82 yen would take the
pair to its lowest level in 15 years.

percent, while digital camera maker Canon Inc declined 4
percent and electronics parts maker Kyocera Corp fell 3

 Overnight, both the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell as disappointing earnings and
economic data trigged profit-taking after Monday's rally drove
them to a 10-week high.
 Data showed U.S. consumer spending and incomes were flat in
June while home purchase contracts tumbled to a record low,
implying an anaemic economic recovery for the remainder of this
year.
 U.S. Treasury debt climbed, sending two-year yields to an
all-time low amid speculation that the Fed may launch a new
round of debt purchases to inject cash into the economy.
 WEAK DOLLAR
 Talk of further Fed easing prompted investors to cut their
dollar exposure, pushing the U.S. currency as low as 85.32 yen,
its lowest since late November.
 A fall below a November low of 84.82 yen would take the
pair to its lowest level in 15 years.
 ""The market is full of dollar bears,"" said Ayako Sera,
market strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking.
 The euro dipped a fifth of a percent from late U.S. trade
to $1.3205, remaining within sight of a three-month high of
$1.3262 reached on Tuesday.
 Stronger growth in Europe and Asia has supported the view
that central banks in those regions could raise interest rates
before the Fed.
 The dollar index, which gauges its performance against
major currencies, was steady at 80.65 -- still below its
200-day moving average. It fell below the key moving average
for the first time since January, signalling further falls.
 Spot gold rose as far as $1,194.75 an ounce, the highest in
just over one week, as speculators bet China's demand would
increase and as investors shifted out of equities on concerns
about the U.S. economy.
 Oil fell 45 cents to $82.11 a barrel after touching $82.64

 * Annual house price growth still running hot at 18 pct
 * Suggests risks are for further rate rises over time
 By Wayne Cole
 SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplus
ballooned to a record in June as export earnings from iron ore
and coal surged, lifting the local dollar and acting as a
reminder of why the next move in interest rates is still likely
to be up.
 The surplus of A$3.54 billion ($3.2 billion) was almost
twice the market forecast and far outstripped the previous
record of A$2.5 billion. The surplus for the three months to
June amounted to A$6.6 billion, a turnaround of almost A$10
billion from the first quarter's deficit and a boon for
economic growth.
 A government measure of city house prices also showed brisk
growth of over 18 percent for the year to June, a worry for the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has been hoping higher
mortgage rates would cool the red-hot sector.
 ""The trade numbers are just massive,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a
senior economist at RBC Capital Markets. ""That's a lot of
income flowing into the economy and we could well see nominal
GDP (gross domestic product) growth in double-digits.""
 ""It's also coming while the labour market is already strong
and unemployment low,"" she added. ""It means the bias is still
for higher interest rates down the track.""
 The central bank left rates unchanged at 4.5 percent at its
monthly policy meeting on Tuesday, and investors are wagering
it will stay on hold well into 2011.
 The market is implying almost no chance of a hike to 4.75
percent in September and October and only 15 basis points of
tightening in the next 12 months.
 But with the country's commodity exports benefiting so
greatly from demand in China and India, analysts suspect rates
will have to head higher at some point.
 ""The RBA is unlikely to be on the sidelines for long in an
economy with 9-10 percent nominal GDP and inflation in the
upper half of the target range,"" said UBS chief economist Scott
Haslem.
 TRADE BONANZA
 ""If the past is any guide, the money from trade will
eventually leak into the broader economy via higher investment,
jobs growth, wages and dividends,"" said Haslem.
 Exports climbed 7.1 percent alone in June, to rise 32
percent from the same month last year. In contrast, imports
rose just 0.2 percent in June.
 Iron ore and copper exports jumped 23 percent in the month,
while coal rose 15 percent rise in coal and cotton more than
doubled. Contract prices for iron ore and coal have surged this
year thanks to demand from China and India, where more than 2
billion people are industrialising at breakneck pace.
 As a result Australia's terms of trade, or the ratio of
export prices to import prices, could rise 20 percent this
year. The RBA's own index of Australian commodity prices
climbed 50 percent in the year to July to the second highest on
record.
 Export volumes also looked to be higher for the second
quarter, implying trade could make a significant contribution
to GDP growth after several quarters of drag.
 It should also see Australia's perennial current account
deficit shrink markedly in the quarter, making it less
vulnerable to swings in global financial sentiment.
 All of this will shower money on the economy at a time when
the jobless rate is already down to 5.1 percent and nearing
lows that have sparked inflation in the past.
 ""It looks like the economy was firing on all cylinders last
quarter,"" said Adam Carr, a senior economist at ICAP. ""The
boost to the terms of trade just shows why Australia is so
strong compared to the rest of the developed world.""
 ""It also means the next move in rates is up, the only
question is when.""

 * Chart resistance at 85.94 and 86.30 yen
 * Euro steady after 1-month high vs dollar
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The dollar held near its highest
in a month against the yen on Friday, capped by chart points and
expected sales by Japanese exporters but supported by wariness of
Japanese yen-selling intervention.
 The euro hovered below a one-month high on the dollar and yen
after strong demand at a Spanish bond auction and after the Swiss
central bank predicted a marked slowdown in growth and lowered
its inflation forecast, sending the Swiss franc down and boosting
the euro.
 After Japan's first intervention in six years this week, the
market is cautious about pushing the dollar down too far against
the yen. It was steady at 85.80 yen, and is three yen above
Wednesday's 15-year low at 82.87 which preceded Japanese
authorities' return to yen selling.
 Japanese exporters may emerge to sell the dollar, with their
half-year book closing this month, and cap it around 86.00 yen,
one trader said, adding that caution about further intervention
is lending support when it nears 85.00.
 Hedge funds have been cutting long yen positions since the
intervention, he said, although it was not clear if they were
still doing so on Friday.
 ""The real key positioning is probably what the corporates and
Japanese investors need to do and I think there there are still
corporates out there that need to sell,"" said Greg Gibbs,
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Sydney.
 Japan is considering increasing the amount of funds available
for currency intervention, Kyodo news agency said late on
Thursday, citing sources close to the matter.
 The government had about 35 trillion yen in funds that can be
used for intervention this fiscal year and Wednesday's
intervention cut the amount to around 33 trillion yen, Kyodo
said, but did not say by how much the government is considering
expanding the funds..
 Money market data from the Bank of Japan late on Thursday
showed Wednesday's intervention may have totalled about 1.76
trillion yen to 1.86 trillion yen ($20.5-$21.7 billion), in line
with estimates circulating in the market..
 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and U.S. President Barack
Obama are set to hold talks on Sept. 23 in New York and the issue
of Japan's currency market intervention will be on the agenda,
the Asahi newspaper said.
 The dollar climbed as far as 85.94 yen on Thursday, its
strongest level since mid-August and challenging resistance from
its 55-day moving average at that level.
 The dollar has further resistance at 86.30 yen, the bottom of
the resistance cloud on its Ichimoku chart.
 The euro eased 0.1 percent to 112.07 yen after hitting a
one-month high at 112.40 on Thursday and was flat on the day at
$1.3072 after reaching as far as $1.3117 in the previous session,
its strongest in a month.

 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister reiterated
on Wednesday that he is closely watching currency moves as a
sell-off in the dollar due to worries about the U.S. economy
tests Japanese policymakers' tolerance for a stronger yen.
 The yen's advance is raising alarm in Japan due to worries it
could prolong deflation and hurt the country's export-driven
economy just as the U.S. and Chinese economies show signs of
slowing down.
 Reflecting such concern, the benchmark 10-year government
bond yield hit a seven-year low below 1.0 percent on Wednesday.
 ""We're watching closely,"" Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda
told reporters when asked about the yen's rise.
 The dollar fell to an eight-month low of 85.47 yen on
Wednesday, and is edging closer to levels it has not traded at
for 15 years.
 The 10-year Japanese government bond yield slid to as low as
0.995 percent, down 4 basis points on the day, and its lowest in
seven years.
 The latest impetus for the JGB rally comes from a run of
disappointing U.S. data that has reinforced concerns the U.S.
economic recovery is losing steam, sparking a renewed rally in
U.S. Treasuries and pushing the dollar towards its lowest levels
against the yen since 1995.
 But some analysts say there is not much room for further
declines in Japanese bond yields.
 ""Japanese bonds are overbought and there is a risk of a
bounce in yields. I think 10-year JGB yields will move in a
0.95-1.15 percent range until the end of September,"" said Nobuto
Yamazaki, executive fund manager at DIAM Asset Management in
Tokyo.
 The dollar index, a measure of the greenback against six
major currencies, was at its lowest since April as a string of
weak U.S. economic data and speculation the Federal Reserve may
consider pumping more money into the economy sent yields on
benchmark two-year Treasury notes to a record low.
 Japan has not intervened in currency markets since a 15-month
period up to March 2004 when authorities sold 35 trillion yen
($408 billion) to curb the yen's strength and support the
country's exporting industries.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Stocks paused a day after
hitting the highest level in 2-1/2 months, while the dollar
slid on Tuesday as disappointing earnings and U.S. economic
data gave investors reason to fret about the global recovery.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices climbed as investors sold some equities, sending the two-year note's yield to an all-time
low, although analysts said U.S. stocks were expected to slip
some after Monday's rally drove them to a 10-week high.
 A Wall Street Journal report that the Federal Reserve was
considering buying more bonds to prop up the economy further
lifted Treasuries' prices.
 U.S. oil futures prices jumped to a three-month high above
$82 a barrel as the weaker dollar made it cheaper for
investors using other currencies to buy the commodity. But
commodity prices fell in general due to the growth concerns.
 Gold was an exception, rising slightly as China announced
moves to allow greater freedom in domestic trading of the
metal.
 Worries about the sustainability of the global recovery
increased after Dow Chemical Co  and Procter & Gamble
 reported quarterly results that missed expectations,
even though strong earnings and a bullish outlook from
drugmaker Pfizer offered some hope.
 Strong earnings have driven the stock market's recent
rally, even as economic data systematically disappoints.
 New orders received by U.S. factories dropped more than
expected in June, while sales of previously owned U.S. homes
fell to a record low, data released earlier in the day showed.
For details, see [ID:nN0238680] and [ID:nN03155165].
 ""People are beginning to accept that the U.S. economy is
coming back to earth and, as far as growth goes, may be
playing second fiddle to other economies,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich,
Connecticut. ""That's driven bond yields down and is sapping
the dollar.""
 Global stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> edged up 0.02 percent, just a blip above the
break-even line, after closing on Monday at their highest
level in 2-1/2 months.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top European shares
also closed practically flat, dipping 0.01 percent to 1,070.79
points as banks and miners gave back some of Monday's sharp
gains.
 SOME SEE BUYING OPPORTUNITY
 ""A bout of weakness in the U.S. in reaction to
worse-than-expected home sales and factory orders data
unsettled traders, but these short-term dips are still
tempting in some buyers,"" said Will Hedden, sales trader at IG
Index in London.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes slipped after each
gained about 2 percent on Monday to close at their highest
levels in 10 weeks.
 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
declined 38.0 points, or 0.36 percent, to end at 10,636.38,

 On the other hand, shares of Dow component Pfizer,
the world's largest drugmaker, rose 5.56 percent to $16.34.
 The market ""needs to pull back anyway,"" said Wayne
Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial in New
York. ""But we did make a new high yesterday and took out

 ""It doesn't mean that we're going to slide into a
double-dip, but it does mean we should expect growth to be
slower"" than previously thought, he said.
 DOLLAR TUMBLES, TREASURIES RALLY
 The dollar plunged in tandem with short-dated U.S.
Treasury debt yields due to fears that the U.S. economic
recovery was faltering.
 The greenback slid against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.41 percent at 80.609.
The index fell below its 200-day moving average for the first
time since January, which analysts said may signal more dollar
selling ahead.
 The euro hit a three-month high of $1.3261 against the
dollar. It pared gains later, but was still up 0.39 percent at
$1.3231. The dollar also fell below 86 yen , its weakest
showing against the Japanese currency since November. Late in
New York on Tuesday, the dollar was at 85.83 yen, down 0.76
percent.
 Douglas Borthwick, a managing director at Faros Trading
LLC, in Stamford, Connecticut, noted that two-year swap
spreads between the United States and Europe are currently at
about 69 basis points.
 ""The yield differential is crying out for higher
euro/dollar,"" he said.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note rose 2/32 in
price to yield 0.54 percent, down from Monday's close of 0.57
percent. Earlier on Tuesday, the two-year note's yield slid to
a record low of 0.52 percent.
 The benchmark 10-year note  gained 17/32 in
price to yield 2.91 percent, down from 2.97 percent late
Monday.
 Another positive catalyst for the Treasury debt rally was
an unsourced report by The Wall Street Journal that the
Federal Reserve would consider buying new mortgage or Treasury
bonds using the cash it receives when its mortgage-bond
holdings mature. [ID:nLDE67201G]
 U.S. crude oil prices  rose $1.21, or 1.49 percent,

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rose against
a broadly softer U.S. currency on Tuesday, but retreated from a
six-week high on growth concerns in the United States, Canada's
biggest trading partner.
 The currency briefly fell after disappointing data fanned
worries about the economic recovery in the United States, which
buys about three-quarters of Canadian exports.
 U.S. consumer spending and incomes were flat in June while
home purchase contracts tumbled to a record low, suggesting an
anemic economic recovery for the remainder of this year.
[ID:nN03143233]
 The Canadian dollar  ended at C$1.0239 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.67 U.S. cents, up from C$1.0283 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.25 U.S. cents, at Friday's close. Most Canadian
markets were closed on Monday for the Civic Holiday.
 ""There's not a lot of movement in the spot rate. Coming
back from the long weekend, there's still a fair amount of
focus on the U.S. economic situation,"" said Shaun Osborne,
chief currency strategist at TD Securities. ""Essentially we're
still stuck in a trading range.""
 The U.S. data also deepened negative sentiment for the
greenback after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on
Monday that the United States has yet to recover fully and
monetary policy must remain accommodative. [ID:nN02276865]
 Speculation that the Fed may consider pumping more money
into the economy through new bond purchases weighed on the
greenback, and other assets denominated in U.S. dollars.
[FRX/] [US/]
 Most Canadian financial markets were closed on Monday for
the holiday weekend, but the Canadian dollar shot as high as
C$1.0204 to the U.S. dollar, or 98 U.S. cents, its highest
level since June 22.
 ""It's been somewhat subdued since,"" said Shane Enright,
executive director, foreign exchange sales, at CIBC World
Markets, saying the currency was making gains but held back
because U.S. growth prospects seem to be diminishing.
 July employment reports from Canada and the United States
on Friday will be the main event market event this week, and
could go a long way to determining views on the economic
recovery in the two countries.
 The first look at Canada's third-quarter jobs data is
expected to yield a modest gain of 15,000 after impressive job
creation in the first half of the year brought the labor market
close to its pre-recession peak. The unemployment rate is
expected to remain steady at 7.9 percent. [ID:nN30270191]
 The reports may also prompt the Canadian dollar to exit its
recent trading range of C$1.03-C$1.05 to the U.S. dollar.
Activity was quiet on Tuesday, with the currency in a 55 basis
point range.
 ""Given the focus on the data we have later in the week, we
may well trade in a bit of a range until we get the employment
data,"" said Osborne.
 BONDS PRICES UP
 Canadian government bond prices edged up with U.S. Treasury
issues as investors mulled the Fed chairman's comments from
Monday, and as disappointing corporate results weakened U.S.
equity markets.
 The soft U.S. data also helped keep a bid to less-risky
assets such as government debt. There were no Canadian releases
on Tuesday.
 The two-year bond  climbed 6 Canadian cents to
yield 1.431 percent, while the 10-year bond  added 5
Canadian cents to yield 3.107 percent.
 Canadian bonds underperformed U.S. issues across most of
the curve, except in the three-year maturity. The Canadian
10-year bond was 19.7 basis points above the comparable U.S.
bond, compared with 14.5 3 basis points in the previous
session.

 By Edward McAllister
 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a fourth
day on Tuesday, setting a fresh three-month highs above $82 per
barrel as the dollar fell and dealers anticipated a decline in
U.S. crude oil inventories after last week's big build.
 Weekly crude oil stocks probably fell by 1.4 million
barrels last week as imports slipped and after Gulf of Mexico
production was interrupted briefly by Tropical Storm Bonnie, a
Reuters survey showed. [EIA/S] American Petroleum Institute
inventory data is due at 4.30 p.m. EDT.
 U.S. September crude futures rose $1.21 to settle at
$82.55. The last time U.S. crude traded above $82 was on May 5.
In London, ICE Brent rose $1.86 to $82.68. Volume was light,
with U.S. NYMEX futures trading just over 475,000 lots, below
the 30-day average of around 535,000 lots.
 ""U.S. inventory data is likely to be supportive as a big
decline in U.S. crude oil stocks is on the cards,"" said Carsten
Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank.
 North Sea Brent crude oil futures rose above U.S. crude for
the first time since mid June as planned summer maintenance
reduced supplies from British and Norwegian oil fields. The
Forties North Sea crude blend, which tends to set the price of
dated Brent, drew no offers or bids on Tuesday for the first
time in months due to tight supplies, traders said.
 Investors also focused on the dollar this week following a
paper last week from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard
talking up the risk of deflation. The dollar tumbled to
multimonth lows against the euro on Tuesday on fears economic
recovery in Europe and Asia will outpace the U.S.
 ""Crude was up on the weak dollar and Brent was higher on
maintenance, helping lead the complex higher,"" said Andrew
Lebow, broker at MF Global in New York.
 U.S. crude futures have convincingly broken out and above
the $70-$80 a barrel trading range this week, which it had been
stuck in for most of the past three months.
 Oil largely shrugged off downbeat economic data showing
that U.S. consumer spending and incomes were flat in June and
the index for pending sales of previously owned homes fell to a
record low, which pulled equities lower.
 And although neither Israel nor Lebanon have big oil
deposits, traders said prices could gain support from a rare
cross-border skirmish between Israeli and Lebanese troops on
Tuesday, the most serious violence along the frontier since a
2006 war that had also elevated oil prices.
 SUPPLIES AND HURRICANES
 This week's inventory reports are also expected to show
supplies of distillates, including diesel, to have increased
1.2 million barrels, while gasoline stocks were expected to
have fallen 400,000 barrels, ending five weeks of gains.
 The anticipated drop in U.S. crude stockpiles would follow
a jump of 7.3 million barrels to 360.8 million barrels in the
week to July 23, the biggest surge since 2008, according to
last week's EIA report. Inventories last week were also
expected to have dropped because of Bonnie-related disruptions
to shipping and production.
 Tropical Depression 4 turned into Tropical Storm Colin in
the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said, but it was not expected to pose a threat
to the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled on Tuesday
against the euro, the yen and sterling as a fall in benchmark
yields to all-time lows offered investors little incentive to
buy assets denominated in the U.S. currency.
 The euro hit a three-month high at $1.3261. And the dollar
index, which measures the greenback against a basket of
currencies, fell below its 200-day moving average for the first
time since January, which analysts said signals more declines.
 A string of weak U.S. economic data and speculation the
Federal Reserve may consider pumping more money into the
economy through new bond purchases has contributed to dwindling
demand for the dollar.
 Yields on benchmark two-year Treasury notes fell to a
record low of 0.53 percent earlier.
 Douglas Borthwick, a managing director at Faros Trading
LLC, in Stamford, Connecticut, noted that two-year swap spreads
between the United States and Europe are currently at about 69
basis points.
 ""The yield differential is crying out for higher
euro/dollar,"" said Borthwick.
 In the past five years, when the swap spread has been at
these levels, the average euro/dollar rate was 1.4192, he said.
 The euro was last up 0.4 percent at $1.3230. It was still
in an uptrend after Monday's break at $1.3125 of a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its move from the November peak to the
June trough, according to Reuters data.
 The next threshold on that basis is the 50 percent
retracement around $1.3510.
 Traders said if the euro can end the week above $1.3350, a
level last seen before fears about Greece accelerated, markets
would take it as a bullish sign that could put the $1.3510
level within range.
 Stronger growth in Europe and Asia raises the chances that
central banks in those regions could raise interest rates
before the U.S. Federal Reserve. Such moves would boost demand
for higher-yielding Asian and European currencies.

 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said Monday the economy had yet

 ""Evidence of near paralysis in the U.S. economy has pushed
U.S. yields consistently lower, and until yields bottom, the
dollar will remain under pressure,"" said Kathy Lien, director
of research at GFT Forex in New York.
 Sterling was up 0.3 percent at $1.5943, near a six-month
peak of $1.5968 hit earlier.
 The dollar index was down 0.4 percent at 80.587 and the

Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Tuesday that excessive,
disorderly moves in the foreign exchange market were
undesirable and that too strong a yen hurts exports and
households.
 TIME TO TAKE PROFITS?
 Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Marc Chandler said the
yen's strength may aggravate the deflationary forces in Japan,
but rather than intervene in the forex market, pressure on the
Bank of Japan may intensify so that it takes additional steps,
such as increasing its Japanese government bond purchases or
expanding existing lending facilities, to combat deflation.
 He also warned the market may be on the verge of

 In June, fear that debt crises in Greece, Spain and
elsewhere were threatening the future of the euro zone pushed
the euro below $1.19, its lowest level since 2006.
 But with euro zone economic data holding firm, attention

""The euro could still have a lot of life left in this recent
run,"" said Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets Inc
in Chicago. ""Even so, the prudent trader knows that in most
cases, it is best to lock in at least partial profit, before

 * Moscow critical of unilateral U.S. sanctions

 By Gleb Stolyarov
 MOSCOW, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions against Iran over
its nuclear programme are preventing a state-connected Russian
company from delivering five passenger jets to Iran under a 2007
contract, the head of the company said on Tuesday.
 Delivery of the Tupolev Tu-204 planes would violate U.S.
sanctions because the U.S. company Pratt & Whitney helped
develop their engines, Alexander Rubtsov, the director of
Ilyushin Finance which has the contract to deliver the planes,
told Reuters.
 ""There is such a problem,"" Rubtsov said by telephone. ""We
will offer planes with different engines.""
 Russia has sharply criticised the United States for hitting
Tehran with unilateral restrictions in addition to the sanctions
adopted by the U.N. Security Council, saying nations seeking to
ensure Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons must act as one.
 Moscow is struggling to balance trade ties with Tehran and
warmer relations with the United States, which is eager for
Kremlin support to rein in nuclear activities it says it
believes are aimed at weapons development.
 Iran has expressed anger over Moscow's backing of sanctions
in the Security Council, where Russia holds veto power.
 The PS-90A2 engines in the passenger planes were made by
Russia's Perm Motors in conjunction with Pratt & Whitney, a unit
of United Technologies Corp.
 Rubstov said Ilyushin Finance, which is part-owned by
state-controlled United Aviation Corporation, would propose
planes with an earlier version of the engine, the PS-90A.
 He did not say how much the contract was worth or when the
U.S. sanctions preventing the delivery had been adopted.
 The United States has introduced increasingly tight trade
restrictions against Iran and took steps on Monday to make it
harder for Tehran to skirt the sanctions.

 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled on Tuesday
against the euro, the yen and sterling as a fall in benchmark
yields to all-time lows caused investors to shun
dollar-denominated assets.
 The euro hit a three-month high at $1.3261. And the dollar

 * Treasury says Iran active sponsor of terrorism
 * White House says Iran not serious about talks
(Recasts lead, adds details from Treasury briefing, comment by
White House official)
 By Corbett B. Daly
 WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department
on Tuesday sought to further tighten curbs against Iran's
nuclear ambitions and its support for terror groups by naming
Iranian-controlled companies and forbidding dealing with them.
 In addition to naming the 21 companies, Treasury cited
leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force
(IRGC-QF) for providing financial support to the Taliban and
other groups.
 ""Iran is the primary founder of Hizbollah and has long been
recognized as the most active state sponsor of terrorism,""
Treasury said, adding that it was targeting IRGC-QF by naming
four of its senior officers.
 Among the four, it said General Hossein Musavi and Colonel
Hasan Mortezavi were providing financial and material support
to the Taliban. The Treasury Department had previously
designated the IRGC-QF in October 2007 as an organization that
supported terror groups but went a step further on Tuesday by
naming its leaders.
 The department also listed 21 companies or entities in six
countries -- engaged in businesses as far-flung as banking,
mining and engineering -- that it said were
Iranian-controlled.
 U.S. law prohibits Americans from doing business with the
government of Iran. The Obama administration said it was naming
the firms so that people can more easily avoid the risk of
dealing with them and accidentally violating sanctions against
trade with Iran.
 ""As its isolation from the international financial and
commercial systems increases, the government of Iran will
continue efforts to evade sanctions, including using
government-owned entities around the world that are not easily
identifiable as Iranian to facilitate transactions in support
of their illicit activities,"" said Stuart Levey, Treasury's
undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
 At a briefing, Levey described Iran as ""by far the most
prolific funder of terrorism in the world.""
 The 21 companies are in Japan, Germany, Italy, Belarus,
Luxembourg and Iran and are not easily recognized from their
names as being Iranian-controlled. For example, one of them is
a Tokyo-based company called Ascotec Japan K.K. and another is
a Hamburg, Germany-based company called West Sun Trade GmbH.
 Treasury also added two Iranian organizations -- the
Iranian Committee for the Reconstruction of Lebanon and the
Imam Khomeini Relief Committee (IKRC) Lebanon branch -- to its
terrorism blacklist.
 The action, under an executive order, freezes any assets
they may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits Americans
and U.S. firms from engaging in any transactions with them.
 ""Today's designations expose Iran's use of its state
apparatus-including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods
Force-and state-run social service organizations to support
terrorism under the guise of providing reconstruction and
economic development assistance or social services,"" the
Treasury said.
 At the White House on Tuesday, spokesman Robert Gibbs was
dismissive of a call from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
for a televised debate with U.S. President Barack Obama to
discuss who has the best solutions for world problems.
 ""We have always said we would be willing to sit down and
discuss Iran's illicit nuclear program if Iran is serious about
doing that,"" Gibbs said, adding ""To date, that seriousness has
not been there.""

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled on Tuesday
to multimonth lows against the euro, yen and sterling on fears
economic recovery in Europe and Asia will outpace that of the
United States.
 A recent string of weak U.S. economic data and speculation
the Federal Reserve may consider pumping more money into the
economy through new bond purchases drove two-year Treasury
yields to 0.534 percent. That was a record low and it
undermined appetite to hold dollars.
 The euro hit a three-month high at $1.3261, according to
Reuters data. The dollar fell below 86 yen, its weakest showing
since November.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said Monday the economy had yet
to recover fully and interest rates should remain low. The Wall

suggesting the Fed may consider renewing Treasury or mortgage
purchases, a policy it ended four months ago.
 Analysts said such a change would suggest policymakers were
worried about the economic outlook.
 The euro was last up 0.4 percent at $1.3230 and was still
in an uptrend after Monday's break of $1.3125, a key technical
level. Sterling was up 0.3 percent at $1.5932, near a six-month
peak of $1.5968 hit earlier.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against the
six major currencies, fell below its 200-day moving average for
the first time since January, which analysts said may signal
more selling. It was off 0.4 percent at 80.640.
 The dollar fell 0.9 percent to 85.69 yen, an eight-moth
low, and the euro shed 0.6 percent to 113.31 yen. 
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Tuesday
that excessive, disorderly moves in the foreign exchange market
were undesirable and that too strong a yen hurts exports and
households..
 UPWARD EURO MOMENTUM INTACT
 In June, fear that debt crises in Greece, Spain and
elsewhere were threatening the future of the euro zone pushed
the euro below $1.19, its lowest level since 2006.
 But with euro zone economic data holding firm, attention
has turned to the dollar and signs of a slowing U.S. economy.
 ""We've broken levels that should have held if we were to be
trending south in euro/dollar,"" said Dag Muller, technical
strategist at SEB in Stockholm, adding he saw a climb to $1.33
in the near term.
 Traders said if the euro can end the week above $1.3350, a
level last seen before fears about Greece accelerated, markets
would see that as a bullish sign that could put $1.3510 in
range, the 50 percent retracement of the euro's
November-to-June swoon.
 Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Marc Chandler said the
market may be on the verge of over-selling the dollar the same
way it did the euro in June.
 In particular, he said with U.S. mortgage rates already
near record lows, the chances of the Fed reviving its bond
buying program is probably lower than the market imagines,
""even if there are contingency discussions"".

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2010 11:16AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Germany eyes full employment, demand impact unclear"," * Tighter job market could boost wages 
 * German firms phasing out shortened hours, hiring again
 * Ageing population a worry, skilled workers lacking
 
 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Germany's job market has bounced
back from recession so quickly that some say the holy grail of
full employment may be within reach, but it is unclear how much
this will boost demand in Europe's biggest economy.
 While full employment -- where all workers seeking jobs can
find them at the going wage rate -- together with higher wages
should boost Germany's domestic consumption and imports, this
may be offset by planned government austerity measures.
 Part of the fall in joblessness is also due to an ageing
population, highlighting a lack of skilled workers, a problem
that industry groups fear will get worse over the next decade.
 The jobless total fell in July for the 13th consecutive
month, taking the unemployment rate to 7.6 percent, a level not
bettered since April 1992. Full employment in Germany is widely
seen as a jobless rate of 4 to 5 percent.
 With the manufacturing sector staging a rally on the back of
resurgent global demand for capital goods, economists say
unemployment should fall further in Germany, which emerged from
its sharpest post-war recession in the second quarter of 2009.
 Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said last week full
employment had become a genuine possibility in the medium term
and had already been reached in parts of the country.
 ""The aim of full employment is by no means a utopia,"" said
Klaus Zimmermann, president of the DIW economic think tank.
 For years analysts complained that stringent job protection
laws made firms cautious to hire even in upturns, but the speed
of the labour market recovery underlines how times have changed.
 Germany shed surprisingly few jobs in the global crisis,
thanks partly to reforms promoting labour force flexibility as
well as state spending to encourage firms to put staff on
""Kurzarbeit"" -- shorter hours -- instead of firing them.
 Goldman Sachs economist Nick Kojucharov said full employment
was reachable next year, adding: ""The less slack there is in the
labour market, the stronger the upward pressure on wages; and
the more income people are getting, the more there is available
for consumption.""
 With earnings at firms like carmaker Volkswagen 
beating forecasts in the first half, there are growing hopes
that workers will get a bigger share of the profits.
 Greater job security and wage hikes may bolster demand in
and outside Germany. This would cheer trading partners like
France, who argue wage restraint has hurt the competitiveness of
other euro zone economies and curbed German demand for imports.
 ""The ongoing recovery ... should support household incomes,
perhaps prompting a pick-up in domestic spending that would
provide a lifeline for the euro zone's beleaguered periphery,""
said Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics.
 
 AUSTERITY, AGEING POPULATION
 But many analysts are sceptical over how much the fall in
unemployment will help the economy, pointing out that fiscal
consolidation will begin next year, offsetting any boost to
household incomes. Furthermore, even in times of high wage
growth, German consumption has historically remained weak.
 There are also signs that global demand is cooling off which
would prompt a slowdown in German exports and weigh on the
labour market recovery in the second half of the year.
 ""While Germany will continue to perform well in the near
term, we hold out little hope of a strong domestic revival,""
said Capital Economics' McKeown.
 Given the uncertainty over the pace of the recovery, many
firms are hiring temporary rather than permanent staff, while
others are first phasing out shorter working hours. 
 By May 2010, the number of workers on shortened hours had
fallen to 481,000 from around 1.4 million a year earlier.
 A spokesman for Siemens  -- a bellwether for the
economy -- said it would phase out shorter hours by the end of
July, having had some 19,000 workers on the scheme. Now the
engineering group is advertising around 2,300 jobs in Germany.
 One of the more problematic factors behind the downwards
trend in unemployment, however, is demographic change.
 Allianz  plans to recruit 2,300 workers in 2010 not
because the economy is recovering but because swathes of workers
are retiring, while the VDI industry group estimates that the
economy is lacking about 35,000 engineers.
 Holger Schaefer at the IW economic think tank in Cologne,
said manufacturing was likely to feel the pinch in coming years.
 ""This won't weigh on the recovery in the short-term -- firms
can still find ways to get around it -- but the problem will
peak when the baby boomers retire over the next 10 years.""
 Some hope that this will be offset from next year when
Germany lifts job market restrictions on workers from the mostly
ex-communist states that joined the European Union in 2004.
 Cabinet ministers last week also suggested lowering the
income threshold and streamlining the visa procedure for skilled
workers seeking entry to Germany.
 According to the Bertelsmann Foundation, some 2.5 million
jobs will be created in Germany over the next 10 years.
 ""Demand for labour will grow stronger than the supply in the
next few years,"" said the foundation's Eric Thode.

 WASHINGTON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The White House said on
Tuesday it is concerned by Russia's detention of dozens of
demonstrators who were protesting restrictions on freedom of
assembly.
 Russian police arrested anti-Kremlin opposition leader
Boris Nemtsov in Moscow and at least 95 others on Saturday at
demonstrations in cities across Russia.
 ""The infringement of Russian citizens' rights to exercise
these freedoms runs counter to our shared commitments to
international norms and common interests in fostering

 U.S.-Russian relations have been on a warming trend with
President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
working to improve ties, although a Cold War-style spy drama in
July provided some tensions.
 Obama and Medvedev have pledged to resolve issues blocking
Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization by the end
of September. The U.S. complaints about the detentions were
seen in Washington as unlikely to affect those negotiations.
 The White House statement said the arrests raised human
rights concerns.
 ""The United States reiterates the importance of embracing
and protecting universal values, including freedoms of
expression and assembly, enshrined in the Russian Constitution
as well as in international agreements which Russia has
signed,"" Hammer said.
 He said freedom of assembly and freedom of expression are

economic modernization.

advance the human rights and democratic values of their fellow

 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled on Tuesday,
plunging in tandem with short-dated U.S. bond yields and
hitting multimonth troughs against the euro, yen and sterling
on mounting fears that a U.S. economic recovery was
faltering.
 The euro hit a three-month high of $1.3261, according to
Reuters data, while the dollar fell below 86 yen, its weakest
showing since November.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against the
euro, yen and four other currencies, fell below its 200-day
moving average for the first time since January, which analysts
said may signal more selling ahead. It was last down 0.3
percent at 80.680.
 Also stinging the dollar was the two-year U.S. Treasury
yield, which fell to a record low of 0.534 percent.
 On Monday, Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke acknowledged
the economy had yet to fully recover and that benchmark U.S.
interest rates must remain low.
 Investors were further unnerved when the Wall Street
Journal reported Tuesday that the Fed -- the U.S. central bank
-- may consider pumping more money into the system by
purchasing new mortgage or Treasury debt.
 The Fed ended a massive bond-buying program four months
ago, and analysts said any change would suggest policymakers
were worried about the economic outlook.
 ""People are beginning to accept that the U.S. economy is
coming back to earth and, as far as growth goes, may be playing
second fiddle to other economies,"" said Andrew Wilkinson,
analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.
""That's driven bond yields down and is sapping the dollar.""
 The euro traded 0.4 percent higher at $1.3230. In June,
fear that debt crises in Greece, Spain and elsewhere were
threatening the future of the euro zone pushed the euro below
$1.19, its lowest level since 2006.
 But with euro zone economic data holding firm and stress
tests showing most European banks with sovereign debt exposure
remain in good health, attention has turned to the dollar and
signs of a slowing U.S. economy.
 ""We've broken levels that should have held if we were to be
trending south in euro/dollar,"" said Dag Muller, technical
strategist at SEB in Stockholm, adding he saw a climb to $1.33

 Traders said if the euro can end the week above $1.3350, a
level last seen before fears about Greece accelerated, markets
would see that as a bullish sign that could put $1.3510 in
range, the 50 percent retracement of the euro's
November-to-June swoon.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.6 percent to 85.94 yen
after hitting a eight-month low.
 Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Tuesday
that excessive, disorderly moves in the foreign exchange market
were undesirable and that too strong a yen hurts exports and
households, while Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he was watching
economic moves.
 Sterling hit a fresh six-month peak at $1.5968 and was last
up 0.4 percent at $1.5940. The Australian dollar fell 0.1
percent to $0.9118, after the central bank there held the
benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent as expected.
 Marc Chandler, senior strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
in New York, said the market may be on the verge of
over-selling the dollar the same way it did the euro in June.

 JERUSALEM, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Israel's shekel  fell
against the dollar late on Tuesday as markets reacted to a
report of the most serious violence on the Israeli-Lebanese

 The shekel had hit an almost three-month high before being

 * India concerned about Chinese influence
 
 By Shihar Aneez
 COLOMBO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka said on Tuesday China
would have no operational role in new oil bunkering facilities
being built as part of a $1.5 billion port due to open in
November on the island nation's southern coast.
 The Hambantota port is set to become Sri Lanka's biggest and
give the Indian Ocean country prime access to traffic on one of
the world's biggest East-West shipping lines, located a few
kilometres off its southern coast.
 China Exim Bank has loaned $77 million to help finance the
oil bunkering operations, while the Chinese government also
loaned another $400 million for the port, central bank data
shows.
 India, an ally of Sri Lanka, has expressed concern that
China's involvement in the port is aimed at making Hambantota
part of a ""String of Pearls"" strategy to widen China's political
influence and boost its energy security.
 ""There is no role for China in its operation,"" Priyath
Wickrama, the chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority, told
Reuters.
 ""China has given us a loan, and one of their construction
companies is helping in the port construction, but the oil
bunkering and the port phase 1 operation will be carried out by
Sri Lanka Ports Authority,"" Wickrama said.
 Sri Lanka on Sunday said it would invite outside investors
into the Hambantota port project, the keystone of a $6 billion
post-war infrastructure revitalisation drive.
 Hambantota will start with 100,0000 metric tonnes of
bunkering capacity, which could be expanded to 4 million metric
tonnes if demand picks up. The bunkering operation is the only
part of the port not open to external investment.

 * Investors selectively buying peripheral euro zone debt
 * Tackling fiscal deficits seen key in continued recovery
 * Fear of political slippage as popular pressure mounts
 
 By Ian Chua
 LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - A rebound in euro zone assets,
including fringe government bonds, shows investors are starting
to look past Europe's sovereign debt crisis but long-term fiscal
hurdles pose risks for assets of the most debt-laden nations.
 Fund managers are being selective about what they buy and
some have opted to steer clear of peripheral euro zone debt,
even at the expense of missing the recent rally, until austerity
measures to rein in record fiscal deficits start to bear fruit.
 They also want to see whether governments resist the
political and public fallout from unpopular deficit-cutting
measures before they start raising their holdings of peripheral
euro zone assets across the board.
 ""It's all about whether the austerity packages can be
implemented and sustained. We're waiting to see what is the
economic impact and stemming from that what is the political
impact,"" said Russell Silberston, head of global interest rates
at Investec Asset Management.
 Euro zone countries from Germany downwards have pledged to
enact dramatic fiscal cuts but it is the bloc's southern flank
-- notably in Greece, Portugal and Spain -- where the most
dramatic surgery is required and there that the risk electorates
may not accept the pain is largest.
 Ireland, which also faced dramatic debts, made an earlier
start on tackling them but faces additional burdens having
bailed out two of its biggest lenders.
 Bank stress test results in July, which showed only seven
out of 91 European banks failed, were the latest in a series of
confidence-boosting exercises going back to May when a $1
trillion emergency package, including a bond purchase programme
by the European Central Bank, was created to stabilise the euro.
 Such steps have boosted the euro, compressed the premium
investors demand to hold peripheral euro zone debt rather than
German government bonds, reduced sovereign credit tensions, and
helped European stocks rise and outperform U.S. stocks.
 The measures have also helped to defuse the tension that had
begun to surround each government debt auction in any of the
peripheral euro zone countries, and yields even fell at Spanish
and Portuguese auctions last month.
 
 SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY?
 That said, recent price moves have yet to reverse the bulk
of decline seen in the past seven months.
 This means the current rally could very well represent a
correction from very bearish positions and at a time when
markets are thinned by the Northern Hemisphere summer holidays.
 ""From the flows, and investor surveys it would appear that
it is the covering of underweights, a lot of it from real money
rather than any initiation of fresh long positions in the
periphery,"" said Jack Kelly, Investment Director, Global Fixed
Income, Standard Life Investments.
 ""A stopping out of ""risk off"" type trades from the hedge
fund community has likely exacerbated the moves in fairly
illiquid markets,"" he said.
 The real test for euro assets will come when real money
investors return in force next month, and when governments
update their budget deficit forecasts.
 ""If the peripheral countries show good progress in deficit
reduction, and the key political players continue to exhibit
unity, then there is no reason why peripheral bonds cannot hold
onto recent gains,"" said Martin Harvey, a fund manager at
Threadneedle.
 
 RELATIVE VALUE GAME
 Having lived through the European debt crisis, investors
will drill into the merits of euro zone member countries, rather
than just buying or shunning their assets indiscriminately.
 ""We have added to positions in Italian bonds in the past few
weeks, but remain cautious regarding the more risky names, such
as Ireland and Portugal,"" said Threadneedle's Harvey.
 Spanish bonds, which led the outperformance versus German
Bunds, were starting to look extended on fundamental grounds,
said Citi analyst Steven Mansell: ""We would advise focusing on
the stronger, non-core markets, notably Italy, for better
relative performance potential.""
 For the euro, further long-term gains against the dollar are
likely although driven more by deteriorating U.S. fundamentals.
Near term, the single currency could struggle after a stellar
rebound to around $1.32, from below $1.20 in early June.
 ""Next three months or so it could pull back towards $1.25,""
said Jan Lambregts, global head of financial markets research at
Rabobank. ""But on a 12-month horizon, we know that people are
going to get a lot more worried about the debt situation in the
U.S ... that could see euro dollar trade up towards
$1.35-$1.40.""

 By Leika Kihara and Stanley White
 TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister on Tuesday
sidestepped questions about intervention to curb yen strength and
said markets should determine exchange rates, prompting the
currency to rise to an eight-month high against the dollar.
 The rise in the yen is raising alarm bells among Japanese
policymakers who worry about its impact on deflation and the
country's vital exports just as the U.S. and Chinese economies
show signs of slowing down.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said it may be necessary to consider
new stimulus steps for the economy given the uncertain outlook,
while a Bank of Japan policymaker said he was watching the yen
closely.
 The yen's rise has raised market speculation of renewed
government pressure on the BOJ to relax its already ultra-loose
policy to take the edge off the currency's appeal -- something
analysts say was behind a policy change in December.
 ""It's more likely for the BOJ to respond,"" said Thomas Harr,
head of Asian FX strategy at Standard Chartered in Singapore.
 ""If there's weaker growth in the United States and China and
Japan is stuck in deflation with a strong yen, there will be
political pressure on the BOJ.""
 Concerns that the global economy is faltering just as it has
emerged from the worst downturn in decades is causing alarm among
policymakers globally.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said last month that
the U.S. central bank would be prepared to take further steps to
bolster growth if needed.
 Japan has the added headache of a strong currency, which
could undermine the export-led recovery in the economy.
 ""Forex rates are decided by markets,"" Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda told lawmakers in the financial affairs committee
in parliament's lower house.
 ""I will be watching daily market moves closely. I would like
to refrain from commenting on whether to intervene or not.""
 YEN CLIMBS
 In the absence of a statement pointing towards intervention,
currency dealers pushed the yen to an eight-month high of 85.90
per dollar on trading platform EBS.
 The yen has gained steadily as concerns have grown about the
outlook for the U.S. economy.
 It is moving closer to 84.82, a 14-year high hit in November
that prompted the central bank to check rates in the market, the
closest it has been to outright intervention since 2004.
 In a 15-month period up to March 2004, Japanese authorities
sold 35 trillion yen to curb the yen's strength and support the
country's exporting industries.
 That has left markets on edge ever since, perceiving a risk
of further intervention every time the yen rises to historically
high levels.
 If the yen's rise is sustained on the back of a U.S. economic
slowdown, it may affect the BOJ's main economic scenario, which
calls for a moderate recovery in Japan's economy, BOJ board
member Ryuzo Miyao said in an interview with the Asahi newspaper.
 Asked if there was a need to ease monetary policy further,
Miyao said it would depend on whether such market moves would
have a crucial effect on Japan's economy.
 The BOJ, which has kept interest rates at 0.1 percent since
late 2008, eased policy in December and March by first setting up
and then expanding a bank funding facility.
 Miyao, a lifelong academic and an expert on monetary policy,
joined the board in March.
 Prime Minister Kan said Japan's economy was improving, but
problems in the labour markets are still severe.
 ""There is also uncertainty about overseas economies, so we
may be approaching the point where we have to consider if it's
necessary to respond in some way,"" he told lawmakers in reply to
questions about an opposition party's proposal for extra stimulus
measures.
 Japan's economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.0 percent in
the first quarter, the second fastest among G7 economies after
Canada.
 Many economists expect growth to slow for the remainder of
this year as a rebound in exports moderates and government
subsidies for energy-efficient goods expire. The downturn and
weak domestic demand have led to 16 straight months of deflation.
 The Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve meet to review
their respective policies on Aug. 10.
 The Fed will consider whether to use cash from maturing
mortgage-bond holdings to buy new mortgage or Treasury bonds,
ploughing money back into the economy rather than allowing its
portfolio to shrink gradually, the Wall Street Journal reported.
 The BOJ has maintained it is ready to act if the economy
deteriorates and analysts think that any change in policy would
be minor.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar hit multi-month lows
against major currencies on Tuesday, stung by speculation that
U.S. interest rates will stay low, while technical factors kept
the currency under selling pressure.
 The dollar index, a measure of its value against a currency
basket, fell to 80.539, its weakest since mid-April and marking
its first break since January below its 200-day moving average,
a move that analysts said would open the door to more losses.
 The euro hit a six-month high of $1.3242 according to
Reuters data, while the dollar fell to 85.86 yen, its weakest
since November 2009.
 Negative sentiment for the U.S. currency grew after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday that the economy
has yet to recover fully and monetary policy must remain
accommodative.
 Also stinging the dollar was the two-year U.S. Treasury
yield's drop to a record low 0.534 percent. It has fallen faster
than its euro zone counterpart, further weakening demand for
short-term U.S. debt and reflecting the market's view that U.S.
rates will stay low.
 ""The jury is still out on the U.S. recovery in Q2, Q3 and
Q4, but the market is taking the more pessimistic view,"" said
Kenneth Broux, market strategist at Lloyds TSB.
 The greenback has slid over the past month after a run of
disappointing U.S. data fuelled expectations that U.S. growth
could lose momentum as official stimulus is withdrawn.
 The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that, given
signs the economy is losing momentum, Fed officials will mull
whether to use cash the central bank receives from maturing
mortgage bond holdings to buy new mortgage or Treasury bonds,
rather than allowing its portfolio to shrink gradually.
 By 0940 GMT, the dollar index traded at 80.598, down 0.4
percent on the day, after breaking below its 200-day moving
average at around 80.722 according to Reuters data.
 The euro traded 0.4 percent higher at $1.3230, while the
U.S. currency was 0.5 percent lower at 86.03 yen.
 
 AUSSIE TRIMS LOSSES
 Technical analysts said the euro's break above a Fibonacci
retracement level against the dollar on Monday was adding to the
common currency's upward momentum.
 ""Technically, we've broken levels that should have held if
we were to be trending south in euro/dollar,"" said Dag Muller,
technical strategist at SEB in Stockholm, adding he saw a climb
to $1.33 in the near term.
 The euro's break was through $1.3125, the 38.2 percent
retracement of its decline from November to June. Having made a
decisive break above that level, investors focused on $1.3510,
the 50 percent retracement of the November-June move.
 The euro raced higher in early European trade, but gains
petered out in the lower $1.32 region, keeping the single
currency hovering around where options at $1.32, $1.3220 and
$1.3250 were seen expiring later in the day.
 The Australian dollar traded at $0.9110, down 0.2 percent on
the day but trimming losses made after retail sales and building
approvals data in Australia disappointed bulls.
 The RBA held its benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent, as
widely expected, and some traders covered Aussie shorts
following a lack of negative surprises in the RBA's statement,
which said policy was appropriate given moderating inflation and
uncertainty about the global outlook.

(Recasts adding management comments)
 By Christiaan Hetzner 
 FRANKFURT, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Germany's BMW posted its best
ever quarterly pretax profit, lifted by surging sales of luxury
cars in China, the relaunch of its lucrative 5 Series saloon and
a weaker euro currency.
 The world's biggest maker of premium cars said it had never
sold as many Rolls-Royce models in six months as it had this
year, showing the sharp recovery in demand for luxury cars was
broad-based, extending to cars bought by the super rich.
 ""The crisis forced Germany's premium carmakers to cut their
costs faster. Now they have new models in the market like the
BMW 5 Series, Mercedes E-Class and Audi A8 and are benefiting
for the first time in years from currency tailwinds,"" UniCredit
auto analyst Georg Stuerzer said.
 Shares in BMW, which also makes the iconic Mini subcompact,
rose more than 5 percent, easily outperforming the European car
sector even though investors had been told by BMW two weeks
earlier that the quarter was far stronger than expected.
 Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) as a percentage of
revenue grew to 9.6 percent at its core automotive division in
the three months to June from a loss last year, far exceeding
the 6 percent expected in a Reuters poll. 
 Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's Audi also reported
second-quarter operating margins north of 9 percent and
Bernstein Research believes Germany's trio of premium carmakers
may be entering a period of record profitability thanks in part
to China and a weaker euro.
 
 NO ONE-SIDED DEPENDENCE 
 Rising numbers of wealthy, brand-conscious Chinese are
driving demand for luxury cars, overtaking debt-laden Europeans
and Americans as the biggest growth driver for Europe's premium
car makers.
 ""Roughly 11 percent of our vehicle sales came from China and
its contribution to revenue and earnings is slightly higher,""
BMW's finance chief Friedrich Eichiner told reporters.
 China's singular importance to demand growth spawns a risk
that government efforts to tighten bank lending and restrain
rampant property speculation could throttle the economy. The
domestic manufacturing industry shrank in July for the first
time since March 2009.
 ""We do not want any one-sided dependence on the Chinese
market,"" CFO Eichiner added, echoing similar comments from
Reithofer made just minutes earlier.
 BMW confirmed its 2010 sales and earnings forecast that it
raised in mid-July, predicting retail volumes would increase by
around 10 percent to more than 1.4 million vehicles while the
automotive EBIT margin would surpass 5 percent.
 ""This now looks conservative in light of Q2 figures,"" Morgan
Stanley wrote to clients, expecting consensus of 5.2 percent to
move up at least 30 percent this year after BMW's second-quarter
automotive EBIT was nearly twice as high as market expectations.
 BMW said it still expects to achieve its long-term return
targets, which include an 8-10 percent automotive EBIT margin,
in 2012.
 ""We believe the stock remains on track to reach a new
earnings peak of 7 euros (per share) by 2013,"" Morgan Stanley
added.

 By James Pomfret and Kelvin Soh
 HONG KONG, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Yuan-denominated equity linked
products could be launched in Hong Kong by the end of this year
as the city's role as an offshore yuan-settlement market
continues to expand, a senior Hong Kong official said on Tuesday.
 ""We're expecting to see some kind of channel in which Hong
Kong yuan deposits can be reinvested in China in investment
vehicles,"" K.C. Chan, Hong Kong's Secretary for Financial
Services and the Treasury, told Reuters, adding that it was
""possible"" such products would be offered this year.
 ""The idea is quite well researched and quite well accepted in
China ... it shouldn't be very far away with some type of early
experimentation,"" he added.
 Chan said he expected China's Ministry of Finance to offer
more yuan-denominated sovereign bonds in Hong Kong as early as
this year after last September's maiden offering.
 ""We hope to see regular issues of sovereign bonds,"" said
Chan, adding that such issues would help deepen the city's debt
market while offering a useful benchmark rate for companies that
want to issue debt in the former British colony.
 Companies and banks that have issued yuan bonds in Hong Kong
have previously taken their cue from official government bonds in
the absence of an official yuan rate, and the regular issuance of
sovereign paper will help for benchmarking purposes.
 China last month eased rules on the sale of yuan-backed
financial products in Hong Kong and gave banks and financial
institutions greater access to yuan funds, as part of the
country's longer term strategy to fully internationalise its
currency.
 The move helped solidify Hong Kong's role as a financial
intermediary between China and the rest of the world, a position
also coveted by rival Shanghai.
 BOND PROCEEDS AS FDI
 Hopewell Highway Infrastructure last month became the first
non-financial company to launch a yuan bond in Hong Kong. The
company received approval from China's central bank to repatriate
the funds to China as foreign direct investment (FDI), a
development that Chan said would blaze a path for other issuers.
 ""I think it definitely is a precedent. It's a sign the PBOC
is showing to the market that they will be supporting this type
of FDI,"" he said.
 Companies are now technically forbidden from transferring
yuan in and out of China, and the inability to send money raised
in Hong Kong back to the mainland is seen as a huge stumbling
block for the city's nascent yuan bond market.
 Chan said the gradual easing of rules and yuan clearance
arrangements in Hong Kong had laid the foundations for a
proliferation of yuan-linked products.
 ""This can actually provide a foundation for the market,"" he
said, adding that authorities would take a hands-off approach and
let the market decide what new products to offer, including
non-deliverable forwards contracts, securitised loans and
interest rate swaps.
 With Beijing having allowed Hong Kong to serve as the major
test-bed for offshore yuan settlement, Goldman Sachs expects a
massive inflow of yuan deposits from China and abroad that could
double the size and revenue pools for the overall Hong Kong
banking sector in five years' time.
 Hong Kong's total yuan deposits currently stand at about 84
billion yuan, less than 2 percent of the territory's total bank
deposits.
 Chan said he expects the use of the yuan for trade
settlements to increase from under 1 percent of China's total
trade now to about 5-10 percent in the future, with Hong Kong
expected to benefit most as the major settlement hub for such
trade activity.
 Hang Seng Bank expects the amount of trade settled in yuan to
rise to about 100 billion yuan by year-end from about 45 billion
yuan at the end of May, although this would still be a tiny
fraction of China's annual trade of more than $2 trillion.

 By Chang-Ran Kim, Asia autos correspondent
 TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp beat
market expectations with its highest quarterly profits in two
years as sales zoomed in Asia, but stuck to its cautious guidance
citing a softer euro and stiffer competition in India.
 Suzuki, in which Volkswagen took a 19.9 percent stake this
year, weathered the financial crisis better than most thanks to a
product line-up heavy on cheaper, small cars such as the Swift
hatchback, and to its dominance in the fast-growing Indian
market.
 Suzuki's local unit, Maruti Suzuki India, sells about half of
India's new cars, but will face more competition over the next
year from Nissan Motor, Toyota Motor and other major brands
aiming for a bigger piece of the market with low-cost cars
tailored to local tastes.
 ""We're facing a tougher race in India, and that situation is
going to continue,"" Senior Managing Officer Toshihiro Suzuki, son
of Chairman Osamu Suzuki, told a news conference.
 He said the company would continue to pour investments into
improving its sales and distribution network in India to stay
ahead.
 Analysts will also be looking at how well car sales in India
hold up in the near term. In a move that could dent demand, the
central bank last week raised interest rates more forcefully than
expected, to fight double-digit inflation. Economists expect a
more aggressive tightening for the rest of the fiscal year,
according to a Reuters poll.
 Suzuki reported an operating profit of 31.95 billion yen
($369 million) for the April-June quarter, up from 6.86 billion
yen a year earlier and beating the average 24.5 billion yen
estimated by five analysts surveyed by Reuters.
 First-quarter net profit was 15.16 billion yen, surging from
2.14 billion yen a year earlier and above Suzuki's forecast for
the six months to Sept. 30.
 ""The market got some jitters after Maruti's (profit decline),
so I think these results will calm some of those fears,"" said
CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets analyst Christopher Richter.
 ""All companies are sounding a cautious note because they
don't want to be caught out. But you do wonder whether the
caution is a bit excessive,"" he said, adding that Suzuki would
likely lift its annual guidance at the end of the first half.
 For the year to March 2011, Suzuki, also the world's
third-biggest motorcycle maker, kept its operating profit
forecast at 80 billion yen, roughly flat from last year. A survey
of 19 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecasts profit of 96
billion yen.
 Suzuki sees this year's net profit at 30 billion yen.
 Suzuki is better shielded against a stronger yen than its
domestic rivals, having set a conservative assumption for the
euro to average 115 yen. With few cars sold in the United States,
the company has little exposure to the dollar.
 The euro was trading around 114 yen on Tuesday.
 Prior to the announcement, Suzuki shares closed up 2.3
percent at 1,868 yen. The stock is down 18 percent in the year to
date, faring worse than Tokyo's transport sector subindex, which
lost 13 percent in the same period.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a
three-month low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday on the
perception that the U.S. growth outlook is deteriorating, forcing
the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low.
 The Australian dollar dropped after retail sales and building
approvals data in Australia disappointed bulls.
 But the Aussie trimmed losses after the Reserve Bank of
Australia's post-meeting statement contained no negative
surprises, prompting players to cover short positions in the
currency.
 The RBA kept its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.5
percent, as widely expected, and said policy was appropriate
given past rate raises, moderating inflation and some uncertainty
about the global outlook.
 The Australian dollar was down 0.1 percent at $0.9115, off
the day's low of $0.9090 hit after the data. It struck a
three-month peak of $0.9146 on Monday. Against the yen, it
slipped 0.3 percent to 78.77 yen.
 The euro stayed near a three-month high after having broken
above a key Fibonacci retracement level, helped by improved risk
appetite after decent manufacturing data from Europe.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.3165, but was near the
three-month high of $1.3196 hit on Monday, when stop-loss orders
were triggered after it broke above $1.3125, a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its decline from November to June.
 The currency's advance could be slowed by option barriers at
$1.32 and $1.3250, although a break through those levels could
open the way for it to reclaim $1.3510, a 50 percent retracement
of its six-month fall to early June.
 Against the yen, the euro slipped 0.2 percent to 113.82 yen.
 Investors' rising risk appetite could push up the pair beyond
the 10-week peak of 114.74 yen hit last week, although there will
be a resistance at 115 yen, where Japanese exporters are likely
to place fresh sell orders, said a trader at a Japanese brokerage
house.
 The dollar index stood at 80.96, flat from late Monday but
just above Monday's three-month low of 80.792.
 A break below 80.723 would put it below its 200-day moving
average for the first time since January and on course to test an
April 14 low of 80.03.
 The greenback has slid over the past month after a run of
disappointing U.S. data fuelled expectations that U.S. growth
could lose momentum as official stimulus is withdrawn.
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent against the Japanese yen to
86.46 yen, not far from an eight-month low of 85.95 yen hit late
last week.
 JAPAN EXPORTERS
 ""With interest rate differentials between the yen and dollar
disappearing, dollar/yen is tending to be driven by Japanese
exporters' flows, as we've seen in the past few sessions,"" said
Daisuke Karakama, a market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 Japanese exporters have been selling the dollar as their
summer holiday season approaches in mid-August.
 Traders said exporters have been lowering the levels at which
they are willing to sell the dollar on views that weakness in the
greenback is likely to persist, with offers seen waiting above 87
yen. That level is below many major Japanese firms' dollar/yen
assumption rates of around 90 yen for the year to March 2011.
 ""Japanese exporters are clearly losing their patience,"" said
Jun Kato, senior manager of the investment department at Shinkin
Asset Management. ""Many are now deeply concerned the dollar could
fall below 85 yen.""
 Mizuho's Karakama noted that, while U.S. shares rose and
long-dated U.S. bonds fell, the two-year U.S. bond yield showed
only a marginal increase on Monday, suggesting limited upside for
the dollar.
 The two-year yield spread between Japanese and U.S. bonds has
had a correlation of over 80 percent most of the time so far this
year.
 U.S. bond yields dipped in Asia, putting mild pressure on the
dollar, after the Wall Street Journal reported the U.S. Federal
Reserve will consider next week whether to use cash from its
maturing mortgage bond holdings to buy new mortgage or Treasury
bonds.
 A break below the November low of 84.82 yen in the dollar/yen
could trigger more market talk about Japanese intervention,
though few market players expect the country's authorities to
step in for now.

 HONG KONG, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to their
highest levels in nearly three months on Tuesday, boosted by
strong European bank results and a sign the U.S. economy was
stronger than expected.
 European shares edged lower as investors took a breather
after Monday's strong rally sparked by robust results from
financial heavyweights HSBC  and BNP Paribas .
[ID:nLDE672031]
 The bank results and stronger-than-expected manufacturing
data from the United States boosted Wall Street on Monday and

 ""A combination of solid earnings from HSBC and BNP Paribas
and strong U.S. manufacturing data has significantly eased
economic worries and boosted appetite for stocks,"" said Lee
Sun-yeb, a market analyst at Shinhan Investment Corporation.
 The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.2
percent to its highest level since early May. It has rallied
strongly from early July on optimism the world would avoid a
'double-dip' recession and is just in positive territory for
the year.
 However, after rallying nearly 18 percent from 2010 lows
hit in May, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index could face some upside
resistance with the relative strength index (RSI) nudging 70,
suggesting the market is close to being overbought.
 U.S. stocks closed at their highest level in 10 weeks on
Monday as the S&P 500 <.SPX> pierced key technical levels.
Energy stocks jumped as a weak the dollar drew investors into
crude futures, which rose 3 percent .
 Reflecting the greater risk appetite seen in stocks, Asian
debt spreads tightened to their narrowest spreads in nearly
three months.
 ""There is money to be put to work. Funds kept a
higher-than-normal cash balance over the past few months

redemptions did not happen,"" said a bond trader from Singapore.
 ""Now, it is a question of do you hold cash and miss the
rally or put the money to work before the rally ends.""
 YEN LIMITS NIKKEI GAINS
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225>, which has lagged regional markets
in recent weeks, climbed 1.3 percent. Mmarket players said
though that the strength of the yen, which at 86.46 per dollar
is close to an eight-month low of 85.95 hit last week, may
limit further stock gains.
 The Nikkei is down over 8 percent in 2010 and has risen 5.6
percent in the past two weeks on strong corporate results from
heavyweights such as Sony <6758.T> and Honda Motor <7267.T>.
 However, analysts are cautious.
 ""This rise is difficult to trust, since it was based mainly
on short-covering in thin volume. If something bad happens, the
markets are likely to fall just as fast,"" said Yutaka Miura, a
senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.

 * Japan, Brazil elections clear up political uncertainty
 * Africa would ""marvelously benefit"" from trade agreement
 By Emma Ashburn
 WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Obama administration's
top trade official said on Monday ""real progress"" could be made
in the long-stalled Doha round of world trade talks by the end
of 2010.
 Political changes will help spur momentum for the World
Trade Organization talks, now in their ninth year, said Ron
Kirk, who has insisted large developing countries like Brazil,
China and India must do more to open their markets to U.S. farm
and manufactured goods.
 ""I'm confident and hopeful that once we get past the
elections in Brazil, now that we're through the elections in
Japan, and others, that we will have enough momentum going into
the end of the year to make some real progress,"" Kirk told
reporters in Washington.
 Japan's ruling party lost its majority in one of two houses
of Parliament in July, and Brazil will hold presidential
elections in October. Representatives of the world's largest
developed and developing economies will meet in November in
Korea for the G20, where trade will be on the agenda.
 Kirk said the atmosphere around the talks was improving.
 ""There is less anxiety now over the notion that it is a
desirable thing"" to engage in world trade talks, Kirk said. ""A
year ago that was almost unanimously rejected.""
 The WTO talks, now in their ninth year, were designed to
spur trade in developing countries. However, negotiations have
floundered over how much rich countries like the United States
and the European Union should cut their trade-distorting farm
subsidies and tariffs in exchange for new market access from
Brazil, India, China and other leading developing countries.
 Kirk spoke on the sidelines of an annual forum on U.S.
trade with Africa. AGOA, or the African Growth and Opportunity
Act, is a U.S. trade program that allows countries in
sub-Saharan Africa to export over 6,400 varieties of goods to
the United States without paying duties.
 Kirk said the AGOA will likely be renewed by Congress
before its 2015 expiration, though it is unlikely to be made
permanent. African trade groups have said the program's
temporary nature discourages long-term investment in the
continent.
 Kirk promoted completion of the Doha round as the best way
to increase African trade.
 ""If we can get Doha done right, with an ambitious and
balanced outcome that encompasses more than just agriculture, I
think many of the sub-Saharan African countries could
marvelously benefit from that,"" he said.

 * Euro at three-month high vs dollar
 * Oil above $81 a barrel on dollar weakness
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Global stocks surged to a 2-1/2
month high and the euro hit a three-month high on Monday as
growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector topped expectations and
European bank earnings boosted optimism.
 The euro neared $1.32 for the first time since early May,
with the single currency picking up steam after it broke a key
technical level.
 Earning from BNP Paribas  and HSBC , two
of Europe's top three banks, topped forecasts as their bad
debts fell sharply, adding to positive sentiment after the
release last month of a report on the health of European
banks.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for a 12th
straight month, and growth slightly topped expectations,
according to an industry report. [ID:nN02170396]
 Crude oil prices rose above $81 a barrel for the first time
since early May, boosted by the weakness in the U.S. dollar,
the upbeat data as well and an increased possibility of a
tropical depression forming in the Atlantic.
 Gold prices fell and government bonds were pressured as the
improved investor sentiment dented the bid for safe havens.
 ""What we've seen over the last few weeks has been decent
earnings, but economic data has been on the weak side. But
today we had good earnings out of Europe, and we actually had
strong economic data, and that is piling on to a decent start
to the month,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist
at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 208.51
points, or 1.99 percent, at 10,674.45. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 24.24 points, or 2.20 percent, at
1,125.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 40.66 points,
or 1.80 percent, at 2,295.36.
 The strong European bank results lifted U.S. bank stocks.
Bank of America Corp  closed up 2.8 percent at $14.44,
and JPMorgan Chase & Co  added 3.4 percent to $41.64.
 The rise in crude prices, coupled with BP's  
attempt to cap for good its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico,
sent energy shares soaring.
 Macondo-linked companies Transocean Ltd 
and Anadarko Petroleum  jumped, with Transocean up 9.7
percent to $50.68, and Anadarko up 8.4 percent to $53.27. The
Philadelphia exchange oil services sector index <.OSX> rose 4.5
percent.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 2.35
percent, reaching a two-and-a-half month high, while the
Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 2.1
percent as investors built on last month's run-up. Emerging
stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 2.1 percent to a three-month high.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> surged 2.6 percent to
reach a three-month closing high boosted by the strong results
from HSBC and BNP Paribas and the U.S. manufacturing data.
 The STOXX Europe 600 Banking <.SX7P> index surged 3.9
percent, snapping two days of losses. HSBC and BNP Paribas both
jumped 5.3 percent, after the banks trumped earnings forecasts
as bad debts fell sharply.
 EURO'S MOVE
 The euro  rose to $1.3176, up 1 percent on the day
and its best level against the greenback since early May.
Analysts said euro buying gained momentum after the currency
broke $1.3125. That was the 38.2 percent retracement of a
decline that began last November and ended in June around
1.1876, its lowest level since 2006.
 The dollar index, however, hit a three-month low, hurt by
worries that the U.S. economic recovery is losing steam.
 The index, which measures the greenback's value against a
basket of currencies, hit a three-month low of 81.354 <.DXY>,
dipping 0.74 percent to 80.934, roughly a 50 percent
retracement of its November-to-June rally.
 ""We're seeing a disconnection as U.S. data stays weak yet
risk appetite is strong. Weak U.S. data will translate into
risk aversion at some point,"" said Tom Levinson, currency
strategist at ING.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, with the 30-year bond
shedding a full point in price after the stronger-than-expected
growth in the manufacturing sector in July.
 The 30-year Treasury bond  was trading one point
lower in price to yield 4.06 percent, up from 3.99 percent late
on Friday, while benchmark 10-year notes  were 16/32
lower to yield 2.96 percent from 2.91 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.56
percent.
 U.S. crude oil  rose $2.49, or 3.15 percent, to
$81.44 per barrel. Spot gold prices  shed gains despite
broad metals and commodity rises amid economic optimism, as

 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a
three-month low on Monday against a basket of currencies on
fears the U.S. recovery is faltering, while the euro soared
after hitting a key technical level.
 Strong European earnings pushed sterling to a six-month
high against the greenback, while the single currency neared
$1.32 for the first time since early May.
 The euro rally picked up steam after it broke above
$1.3125, a key technical level. That marked the 38.2 percent
retracement of a decline that began in November and took the
euro to $1.1876 in June, its lowest level since 2006.
 A close above that level would be a bullish sign, with
$1.3510, the 50 percent retracement of the November-to-June
move, a potential target, traders said. They added that
barriers around $1.3200, $1.3250 and beyond could make it a
slow and difficult climb.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro was up 1
percent at $1.3170 .
 ""If we close above key technical levels on the euro, we may
be in for a sharp acceleration,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior
strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. ""It's a broad
dollar-weakness story right now.""
 Signs of weaker U.S. growth have weighed on the dollar in
recent weeks. The government on Friday reported that growth
slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday said the
economy is still far from achieving full recovery.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Global stocks surged to a 2-1/2
month high and the euro hit a three-month high on Monday as
better-than-expected growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector
and encouraging corporate earnings spurred the appetite for
risky assets.
 The euro neared $1.32 for the first time since early May,
with the single currency picking up steam after it broke a key
technical level.
 Earning from BNP Paribas  and HSBC , two
of Europe's top three banks, boosted optimism for corporate
results after the release last month of a report on the health
of European banks.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for a 12th
straight month and slightly topped expectations, according to
an industry report. [ID:nN02170396]
 Crude oil prices rose above $81 a barrel for the first time
since early May, boosted by the upbeat data as well as an
increased possibility of a tropical depression forming in the
Atlantic. Gold prices rallied in tandem with other commodities
while government bonds were pressured as the improved investor
sentiment dented the bid for safe havens.
 ""What we've seen over the last few weeks has been decent
earnings, but economic data has been on the weak side. But
today we had good earnings out of Europe, and we actually had
strong economic data, and that is piling on to a decent start

at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 176.20
points, or 1.68 percent, at 10,642.14. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 19.98 points, or 1.81 percent, at
1,121.58. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 38.55

 The strong European bank results lifted U.S. bank stocks.
Bank of America Corp  was up 2.6 percent at $14.40, and
JPMorgan Chase & Co  added 1.8 percent to $41.01.
 The rise in crude prices, coupled with BP's  
attempt to cap for good its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico,
sent energy shares soaring.
 Macondo-linked companies Transocean Ltd 
jumped 6.7 percent to $49.29 and Anadarko Petroleum 
gained 5.5 percent to $51.84. The Philadelphia exchange oil

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> surged 2.6 percent to
reach a three-month closing high boosted by the strong results
from HSBC and BNP Paribas and the U.S. manufacturing data.
 The STOXX Europe 600 Banking <.SX7P> index surged 3.9
percent, snapping two days of losses. HSBC and BNP Paribas both
jumped 5.3 percent, after the banks trumped earnings forecasts
as bad debts fell sharply.
 EURO'S MOVE
 The euro  rose to $1.3176, up 1 percent on the day
and its best level against the greenback since early May.
Analysts said euro buying gained momentum after the currency
broke $1.3125. That was the 38.2 percent retracement of a
decline that began last November and ended in June around
1.1876, its lowest level since 2006.
 The dollar edged up against the yen after the Institute for
Supply Management said U.S. manufacturing activity did not slow
as much as economists had predicted in July. The dollar rose to
86.75 yen  from around 86.50 yen before the data.
 The dollar index, however, hit a three-month low, hurt by
worries that the U.S. economic recovery is losing steam.
 The index, which measures the greenback's value against a
basket of currencies, hit a three-month low of 81.354 <.DXY>,
dipping 0.70 percent to 80.965, roughly a 50 percent
retracement of its November-to-June rally.

 Sterling hit a six-month high versus the dollar  of
$1.5820 and outpaced the euro , rising to a
four-week high of 82.64 pence.

shedding a full point in price after the stronger-than-expected
growth in the manufacturing sector in July.
 The 30-year Treasury bond  was trading one point
lower in price to yield 4.05 percent, up from 3.99 percent late
on Friday, while benchmark 10-year notes  were 13/32

prices gained.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Global stocks surged to a 2-1/2
month high on Monday, supported by better-than-expected U.S.
economic data and encouraging corporate results, including
strong European bank earnings, while the euro broke above a key
technical level.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the 12th
straight month and at a rate that was slightly better than
expected, while U.S. construction spending unexpectedly rose
0.1 percent in June as increased investment in public projects
offset the 15th straight monthly decline in private
non-residential construction, reports showed.
 The upbeat data boosted crude oil and gold prices and
pushed the euro up against the dollar to hit its highest since
May, while government bonds were pressured as investor
sentiment improved and lifted appetite for risky assets.

three-month high.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> surged 2.57 percent as
upbeat results from BNP Paribas  and HSBC 
boosted optimism for corporate earnings.
 BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, rose 5 percent
after posting higher-than-expected second-quarter net profit
thanks to lower loan provisions and strong retail banking,
which offset the impact on its business of volatile financial
markets.
 HSBC said its half-year profits hit $11.1 billion, more
than double the $5 billion a year ago, sending its shares up
more than 5 percent.
 EURO'S MOVE
 The euro  rose to $1.3176, up 1 percent on the day

 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Fear that the U.S. recovery is
faltering drove the dollar to a three-month low against a

 But the Chinese data and recent solid reports from Europe

pushed currencies through important technical levels.
 Analysts said the euro's rally appears to be gaining

 JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Reuters) - With municipal elections
due in May, South Africa's political temperature is bound to
rise, with protests against unemployment and shoddy public
services, and mudslinging by politicians.
 Some protests will be violent and the rhetoric vitriolic,
but not likely to be enough to cause material changes to
government spending plans that some economists say are overly
expansive and risk an unsustainable budget deficit.
 That said, state employees have rejected an initial 4.8
percent pay offer, demanding a 10 percent raise that is nearly
three times current inflation.
 President Jacob Zuma has made tackling persistent 25 percent
unemployment his top priority, but his plans so far have managed
to anger unions, who say they will harm workers, and
businessmen, who say they will make labour more expensive.
 
 ELECTION
 The dominance of Zuma's African National Congress (ANC) in
the May 18 municipal polls is not in doubt. Instead, the vote is
more interesting as a gauge of Zuma's leadership and popularity
nationally and inside his ruling alliance.
 Labour federation COSATU, a formal ANC partner in government
and a powerful vote-getting machine, is using the election to
push for policy influence by saying it will only support ANC
candidates it sees as free from the taint of corruption.
 Five out of South Africa's nine provinces have already seen
violent demonstrations against the ANC's annointment of
candidates, suggesting popular discontent with what is seen as
the ruling party handing out positions to its friends.
 The election may also ignite protests by the legions of poor
black South Africans over a lack of housing, healthcare and
basic schools and amenities, despite billions of dollars of
social spending in the 17 years since the end of apartheid.
 It could even set off another spate of violence against
foreigners, as politicians pandering for votes blame immigrants
for a lack of jobs and public services. 
 What to watch:
 - COSATU opposing ANC candidates or attacking Zuma
 - Anti-foreigner political rhetoric or violence
 - Public sector wage negotiations
 
 THE RAND AND INFLATION
 The rand has gained more than 26 percent against the dollar
since the start of 2009, giving Africa's biggest economy a major
buffer against inflation even thought exporters in the
manufacturing and mining sectors have suffered.
 However, soaring world oil prices and a recovering economy
have put the heat under inflation once more and interest rates
look set to rise from 30-year lows before the end of the year,
increasing the allure of the currency to foreign investors.
 As the elections approach, unions, industry and ANC
left-wingers are likely to renew their calls for rand
devaluation -- 8 to the dollar is a popular cry -- although the
Treasury and central bank show no signs of buckling.
 Both have said repeatedly that markets should determine the
level of the currency, and the Reserve Bank has said
intervention will remain limited to accumulating foreign
currency reserves.
 A tax on short-term capital inflows to curb rand strength
appears equally unlikely.
 What to watch:
 - Levels of central bank dollar-buying
 - Signs of cracks in central bank, treasury opposition to
rand intervention
 
 LABOUR AND THE ECONOMY
 The ANC is proposing sweeping changes to labour laws to
increase job security for temporary workers, but economists say
the shake-up will worsen unemployment by piling more costs on
employers.
 The bills are the most contentious pieces of legislation in
parliament and any watering down could cause friction between
the ANC and COSATU, which has threatened ""the mother of all
battles"" over the reforms.
 COSATU wants no changes to the laws, which aim to end
exploitation of temporary workers by so-called ""labour brokers""
by transforming part-timers into full-time employees.
 But a government-commissioned report said the four bills
would deal a whopping blow to the economy, which is struggling
to shake off the after-effects of a 2009 recession.
 Zuma has pledged 39 billion rand ($5.6 billion) for job
creation and factory investment to make a dent in unemployment
-- part of a package of measures that is keeping the budget
deficit at 5.3 percent of GDP despite pledges last year to cut
it sooner rather than later.
 What to watch for:
 - Progress of the labour bills through parliament
 
 CORRUPTION
 A series of mining scandals involving companies with close
family ties to Zuma, and the assassination of a Cape Town
underworld boss alleged to have high-level government protection
have raised serious questions about the police and officialdom.
 The mining imbroglios have fuelled the belief that the ANC
under Zuma, whose presidency runs until 2014, is suffering a
leadership vacuum where cronyism can thrive.
 Since the scandals, the mines ministry has imposed a
moratorium on new licence applications and launched an audit of
existing licences.
 Preliminary results of the audit revealed a wide array of
problems, although the ministry says they will be fixed. The
lifting the moratorium at the start of April and more complete
results of the audit should indicate whether that is possible.
 Meanwhile, last month's hit on Cape Town godfather Cyril
Beeke, and the subsequent arrest of a fugitive Czech businessman
have exposed a web of links between the underworld, police and
senior ANC figures, bringing the neutrality of the criminal
justice system into doubt.
 What to watch:
 - More revelations from the mining audit, whose success or
otherwise is a barometer of ANC committment to tackling cronyism
 - Trial of Czech businessman Radovan Krejcir, which could
expose a feared rot in justice system
 
 NATIONALISATION
 Senior ANC economic figure Enoch Godongwana stunned business
last month when he said the government was considering copying a
controversial Australian mining windfall tax to redress the ""raw
deal"" South Africans were getting from existing minerals levies.
 Speaking in Sydney, Godongwana said nationalisation of the
mines -- as the ANC's radical Youth League wants -- was not
policy, but his comments rekindled fears of more, not less,
state intervention in the sector as commodity prices soar.
 Despite his talk of a mining tax shake-up, nothing concrete
is expected before the ANC's next major policy conference, in
2012.
 Nationalisation is extremely unlikely given the massive
economic and political costs it would entail. A new state coal
mining firm appears to have defined the limits -- so far -- of
active state participation.
 What to watch:
 - Imposition of a minerals windfall tax
 - How the new state mining firm functions

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2010 07:56AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Key political risks to watch in Kenya," By James Macharia
 NAIROBI, April 1 (Reuters) - Six suspected masterminds of
Kenya's deadly post-election violence, including senior cabinet
officials, will appear at The Hague next week, a move that could
potentially tilt the balance of power in next year's elections.
 The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Luis
Moreno-Ocampo, in December named three Kenyan government
ministers, the cabinet secretary and a former police chief among
the half a dozen suspected orchestrators of the east African
country's deadly post-election violence in 2008.
 All six suspects say they will obey summonses to go to the
ICC on April 7 and 8 for an initial appearance, and several
lawmakers have vowed to travel with them in a show of support,
igniting fresh infighting in the shaky coalition cabinet.
 On another front, political leaders have so far refused to
set aside their partisan and ethnic interests and delayed the
bedding down of the country's new constitution adopted last
August. Can they set aside their differences and pass the
required laws meant to give the constitition legs to stand on?
 A flare-up of fighting in Somalia has also revived the
threat of a strike by al Shabaab, the Somali militants who claim
links to al Qaeda, which attacked Kenya twice, in 1998 and 2002.
 The al Shabaab group have threatened to attack Nairobi for
training Somali army troops.
 At stake is an economy projected to grow by 5.7 percent this
year due to a resurgent tourism sector and rebounding tea and
horticulture revenues that are spurring a recovery of the
farm-based economy, ranked fourth in sub-Saharan Africa.
 An emerging drought in parts of the country could dent the
forecast growth, while rising inflation and a weaker shilling
could undermine the economy further.
 Following are some of the main risk factors to watch:
 
 ICC SUMMONS AND KENYA POLITICS
 The ICC's handling of the case could tilt the balance of
power in next year's elections.
 Kenya's parliament has voted to pull the country out of the
ICC, and a faction in the cabinet, led by President Mwai Kibaki,
wants to block the cases from going ahead at The Hague. 
 They have asked the United Nations -- which has an influence
over the ICC -- to suspend the cases for a year, and eventually
have them heard in Nairobi under a local court following
judicial reforms.
 Prime Minister Raila Odinga's arm of the cabinet have
written to the United Nations asking it to decline Kibaki's
request and want the trials to go ahead at The Hague. Odinga
says he will only back local trials if a credible tribunal is
established. 
 Analysts say Kibaki and his allies want to shield top
suspects from the trials by requesting a one-year haitus, which
would allow them to run for the presidency in next year's polls.
 Odinga's camp are keen to have the trials proceed promptly
so that his rivals are locked out of the running.
 Prominent among the suspects are Finance Minister and Deputy
Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Kenya's founding father
Jomo Kenyatta, and William Ruto, a minister who has been
suspended to fight a corruption case. Both say they will run for
president, and have formed an alliance to lock Odinga out.
 Opinion polls show Odinga -- who accused Kibaki of robbing
him of victory in the Dec. 2007 polls, triggering the violence
-- as the frontrunner to replace Kibaki, who is barred by law
from seeking a third term.
 Some analysts say Kibaki's drive to block the cases is more
to prevent evidence emerging that could taint him than what is
widely seen as a plan to shield cabinet allies.
 After the initial hearing, a confirmation of charges hearing
is expected to take place later this year, followed within 60
days by a decision on whether the suspects will be ordered to
stand trial later next year.
 
 What to watch: 
 -- The government's official stance is that it will
cooperate fully with the ICC. Opinion polls show many Kenyans
want the six tried and convicted to avoid a repeat of the
bloodshed when the country votes again in 2012. -- Failure
to cooperate with the ICC would concern foreign investors and
Western governments who want Kenya to combat impunity and rein
in politicians who fan tribal animosities. 
 -- The political tug-of-war has ignited a crisis in the
cabinet and polarised Kenya's political landscape, worrying
investors and denting the country's stocks and shilling. What
will further wrangling do to the economy?
 -- If the suspects are indicted, the court could issue
arrest warrants for them. This could ignite violence by their
supporters if the warrants are enforced. Kenya chose not to
arrest Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir on ICC charges
of genocide during a visit last August, and may refuse to arrest
the suspects. 
 Rights groups say they will demand the arrests, and this
could cause anger on the streets. 
 -- Indictments against the Kibaki-backed alliance of
Kenyatta and Ruto could scupper their plans to run for the
presidency, and there may be a chance of a violent response from
their supporters who are already angry their leaders have been
singled out as masterminds of the clashes.
 -- Should the trials go ahead, incriminating evidence may
emerge pointing to other leaders, which could rock the cabinet
and Kenya's political landscape even further.
 -- Should the ICC fail to confirm the cases against Kenyatta
and Ruto, their political stock would rise and they could give
Odinga a run for his money in the race to succeed Kibaki.
 
 CONSTITUTION ON THE ROPES
 Kenya's new constitution requires several new laws to be
passed in order to have legs to stand on, but the implementation
exercise has been hobbled by those who opposed the basic law
during a referendum held last August.
 Kenya has missed deadlines in bedding down the basic law,
including appointing a new chief justice after the previous one
left office in February, mostly due to political squabbles.
 The new constitution, which Kenyans have sought for more
than 20 years, aims to trim presidential powers and curb the
corruption, political patronage, land-grabbing and tribalism
which have plagued Kenya since independence from Britain in
1963. 
 Kibaki has asked parliament to pass the laws speedily and
help to overhaul Kenya's political landscape before next year's
elections, but analysts fear politicians will clog the process
for their own individual or party interests.
 What to watch:
 -- Will the country's political leaders set aside their
partisan and ethnic interests and rally behind the
implementation of the new law? So far they have fallen back to
their old ways, leading to a delay in passing laws.
 -- Kenya risks losing international goodwill, and even
funding, if it fails to implement the constitution fully. 
 -- Analysts say the jury is still out on Kenya's war on
corruption, which has been given a lift under the new
constitution, and the test will be whether high profile
officials who have been named in scandals are ever convicted.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2010 07:40AM ET</span>",S.Africa's Zuma steps up BRICs charm offensive," * Zuma to visit Russia, China in August
 * S.Africa looks to BRICs to reduce trade reliance on Europe
 
 By Ed Cropley
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 2 (Reuters) - South African President
Jacob Zuma goes to Russia and China this month, part of a push
to open new trade and investment routes to the fast-growing
emerging economies to replace traditional markets in Europe.
 The trips come on the heels of a state visit to South Africa
by Brazilian President Luis Inazio Lula da Silva during last
month's soccer World Cup that underscored the importance
emerging countries are placing on boosting mutual trade.
 They also mean Zuma will have visited all four of the BRICs
countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- in a little over
a year after taking office.
 ""It's very telling,"" said Martyn Davies of Frontier
Advisory, a Johannesburg-based consultancy. ""This year Zuma will
have been to all four BRIC economies. That is quite something.""
 First stop for Zuma will be Moscow on Aug. 5-6, where he
will hold talks with President Dmitry Medvedev, who made his
maiden trip to Africa a year ago although he did not visit South
Africa, easily the continent's biggest economy.
 Zuma will then go to China on an official visit towards the
end of the month although final dates are still being drawn up,
a foreign ministry spokesman said.
 The Russia trip has a formal focus on building ties in
sectors such as agriculture, defence and mining, although it
will also enable Zuma to get a glimpse of how Moscow oversees an
economy set to grow twice as fast as his own this year.
 With forecast expansion of just 2.3 percent this year, South
Africa stacks up even less favourably against China and India --
a prime reason BRICs is just BRICs, and not BRICSA, as many
policymakers in Pretoria would wish.
 To this end, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) is
in the middle of major soul-searching, in particular over how to
tackle the chronic and persistent unemployment that has tended
to cap annual growth at 5 percent, even in the best of times.
 Many ANC officials are starting to regard the success of the
BRICs economies as proof that the state should be doing more,
not less, to nurture growth -- a departure from the free-market
orthodoxy that has prevailed since the end of apartheid in 1994.
 ""Pretoria's interpretation of what's driving BRICs is that
it's very much a state-capitalist approach,"" Davies said.
 
 MORE TRADE, MORE COMPETITION?
 At a more practical level, Zuma's trips are also part of the
push to open up new markets for South African exports -- another
part of the government's plans to boost growth and create jobs.
 Yet it could also have the effect of exposing the relative
lack of competitiveness in an economy built on mining and
struggling to adapt to the realities of the post-apartheid era.
 In particular, its labour market remains hamstrung by unions
who occupy a privileged position in society and goverment
because of their prominence in the fight against white-minority
rule and have held frequent strikes to demand above-inflation
wage rises.
 A World Bank study published last week showed South African
unit labour costs in 2008 were higher than any other mainstream
emerging market apart from Morocco.
 And even though it was perceived as an easy place to do
business, its ports came out as exceptionally sluggish, taking
an average 43 days to clear a standard unit of cargo, compared
to 37 in Nigeria, 30 in China and just 16 in Argentina.
 ""South Africa is exporting far less industrial output and
attracting less foreign direct investment (FDI) than many in the
same peer group,"" the World Bank report said.
 ""More significantly, it is not exporting or attracting FDI
as much as it needs to tackle its twin challenges of high
unemployment and widespread poverty.""

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The dollar index hit a three-month
low on Monday, hurt by worries that the U.S. economy's recovery
is losing steam, while the high-yielding Australian dollar
reached a three-month high, buoyed by a rise in equities.
 The dollar has been hobbled by concerns over the U.S.
economy after recent economic data undershot market
expectations, while European data and many company results have
been stronger -- keeping investors buying riskier assets.
 Robust results from HSBC <0005.HK> and BNP Paribas
 helped risk sentiment on Monday, as European shares
rose close to 2 percent <.FTEU3>.
 ""It may not be a bad trade in the thinned liquidity of
summer months to trade up the European currencies which have
been rising on the strength of their economic data,"" said Hans
Redeker, head of FX strategy at BNP Paribas.
 But analysts said the perceived better risk sentiment
outside of the United States was unlikely to be maintained if
the world's biggest economy continued to underperform.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of currencies, hit a three-month low of 81.354
<.DXY>, dipping below support near 81.44, which is roughly a 50
percent retracement of its November to June rally.
 By 1055 GMT, it was at 81.389, down 0.2 percent on the day.
 ""We're seeing a disconnection as U.S. data stays weak yet
risk appetite is strong. Weak U.S. data will translate into risk
aversion at some point,"" said Tom Levinson, currency strategist
at ING.

showed the biggest accumulation of net dollar short positions
from speculators since December 2009. [ID:nN30211179]

 The euro was up 0.2 percent from late U.S. trading on Friday
to $1.3072 , near a three-month high of $1.3107 marked
last week. 
 Key resistance was at $1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement
of the fall from late November to early June, while options
traders noted barriers in place at $1.3200, $1.3250 and $1.3300,
said to expire from the end of August into early September.
 Sterling hit a six-month high versus the dollar  of
$1.5820 and outpaced the euro , rising to a four-week
high of 82.64 pence.
 
 AUSSIE RISES, YEN SLIPS
 The dollar also fell against the high-yielding Australian
and New Zealand dollars, with the Aussie hitting a three-month
peak at $0.9136 . They were buoyed by gains for global
equities, which rose 0.9 percent <.MIWD00000PUS>.

July from 52.1 in June, but still remained above the

 The yen slipped broadly and pulled back a bit from an
eight-month high versus the dollar of 85.95 yen hit late last
week. It was last at up 0.3 percent to 86.75 yen .
 Japanese finance minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday
excessive yen movements were undesirable because of the
currency's impact on the economy and markets, and he was
watching currency moves closely. [ID:nTOE67001Q]
 The dollar was battered after data on Friday showed the U.S.
economy slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second
quarter.
 Traders will look to the Institute for Supply Management's
manufacturing index due out at 1400 GMT, which is seen falling
to 54.1 in July from 56.2 the previous month.
 The dollar's performance will hinge on the performance of
U.S. non-farm payrolls data due on Friday, which will set the
stage for the Fed's policy-setting meeting on Aug. 10, BNP's
Redeker said.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2010 07:12AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Mainstream funds drawn to loans for world's poorest," * Funds see microfinance as way to diversify
 * Microfinance firms have shown strong relative performance
 * Political, correlation risks remain
 
 By Eunice Ng
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Microfinance and its goal of
helping people escape the poverty trap is starting to draw
mainstream investors who, ethical cudos aside, are lured by its
inherent insulation from global financial trends.
 Microfinance schemes involve loans of a few dollars to some
of the world's poorest -- long treated as unbankable -- allowing
them to grow their businesses by things as simple as buying
better seeds or fertiliser or expanding street stalls.
 From a modest beginning 30 years ago, the sector has
ballooned in the last decade, particularly since Bangladeshi
microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunas won the Nobel Peace Prize in
2006. 
 But once the purview of development charities, now
hard-nosed mainstream investors are getting involved. From 2005
to 2009, MIV assets grew to $6 billion from $1.2 billion,
according to microfinance rating agency Microrate.
 The world's poorest might struggle to feed themselves on a
daily basis, but they have proved surprisingly reliable at
repaying their loans. Their position at the bottom of the global
financial pyramid also means that while they might be vulnerable
to local shocks such as floods and riots, their businesses are
less correlated to official monetary policy and the ups and
downs of global markets.
 ""Investors come in because they think it is good
diversification. (Microfinance is an) asset class that has
different drivers than other asset classes ...and doesn't react
to shocks in the same manner,"" said Jean-Pierre Klumpp, CEO of
BlueOrchard, a microfinance investment company.
 The steady growth in investment interest has been remarkable
during one of the most turbulent periods for developed world
finance and the global economy in 60 years.
 Big institutional investors such as pension funds, acting
mostly through Switzerland-managed microfinance investment
vehicles (MIV), are starting to look at this specialist area as
a viable long-term asset class.
Microfinance institutions lend small sums to large numbers of
borrowers, but for each loan, interest rates are relatively
high, a key reason why the sector is appealing to institutions.
 
 BETTER BOUNCE BACK
 So how has microfinance performed relatively for anyone who
locked into it several years ago?
 A study from think-tank Consultative Group to Assist the
Poor (CGAP) showed JPMorgan's Low Income Financial Institutions
index, which consists of four microfinance institutions that
went public in 2007 and measures publicly-traded stocks of banks
servicing low income clients, would have outperformed global
equity indices by more than 700 percent from 2003 to 2009.
 While the index did plummet alongside other world bourses
and emerging financial stocks as the credit crisis triggered a
world recession, it has more than recovered those losses and
investments made in 2007 would be back in the money.
 By contrast, despite a recent rally neither the MSCI world
index nor its emerging market sub-component have made it back to
their late 2007 peaks.
 
 A CAUTIONARY NOTE
 Yet even microfinance cannot insulate itself completely from
the dominant global trends.
 MIV growth slowed during the financial crisis, growing only
22 percent in 2009, compared to the 97 percent growth seen in
2007, according to Microrate.
 The survey also noted that less than half the MIV funds
actually reached microfinance institutions. The global financial
crisis put a stop to the industry's frenetic growth, and
consequently institutions stopped asking for funding.
 Ironically, as institutional investors show an increasing
interest in the sector, bringing it more in line with the global
financial system, microfinance is at risk of losing its
attractiveness as a diverse asset.
 ""The industry cannot be completely de-correlated,"" said
Christian Speckhardt, a member of the management board at
responsAbility, a social investment company.
 Political and social risks also remain extremely high.
 A good example is Nicaragua, a country which has one of the
more mature microfinance industries. By late 2008, an economy
that was already facing shrinking remittances from the United
States turned on microfinance, saying its interest rates were
exorbitant. Borrowers defaulted en masse and some even tried to
burn down a microfinance office.
 ""If a microfinance country would go into a prolonged war
situation or a serious political unrest - these are situations
that can have a significant impact on the local microfinance
industry,"" added Speckhardt.

 By Matthew Lynley
 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Global manufacturing showed
little risk of a double-dip recession as output in July grew in
the United States and Europe and a rare contraction in China
suggested Beijing was successfully reining in its hot economy.
 Global stock markets <.MIWD00000PUS> welcomed Monday's news
that the U.S. manufacturing sector grew last month for a 12th
straight month and at a rate slightly better than expected. For
details, see [ID:nN02183874]
 The Institute of Supply Management's index of factory
activity fell to 55.5 in July from 56.2 in June but topped an
updated median forecast of 74 economists surveyed by Reuters
for a reading of 54.2.
 However, the growth rate was its lowest so far in 2010 and
the new orders index slumped five points in July to 53.5, down
almost 12 points from May's 65. That could indicate weaker
manufacturing in the second half of the year.
 ""This suggests a gradual cooling in growth is more likely
than a steep retrenchment,"" said Zach Pandl, U.S. economist
with Nomura Securities in New York.
 Credit Suisse said the 55.5 headline index was consistent
with 3.75 percent economic growth, while RBS analysts said it
indicated 4.5 percent real GDP growth.
 In Europe, production continued to grow after concerns
about public debt levels and the health of the region's banks
in recent months.
 The euro zone's manufacturing purchasing managers index
rose further above the 50 mark that separates growth from
contraction, to 56.7 in July from 55.6 in June, led by Germany
and Italy. [ID:nSLAUIE69E]
 But French manufacturing growth slowed to its weakest in 10
months, illustrating how uneven the rebound is even within
Europe.
 Meanwhile, production fell in China as the government
successfully pulled back on the growth throttle. HSBC's PMI of
Chinese companies showed government steps to slow bank lending
and fight property speculation hit home as the headline index
dipped below the 50 mark for the first time since the depths of
the global downturn. [ID:nTOE67103Z]
 ""While manufacturing may be slowing, we haven't gone off a
cliff,"" said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist with IHS Global
Insight, in Lexington, Massachusetts. ""The question is, are we
going to stabilize or fall into a double dip? In that context,
these numbers are encouraging.""
 The U.S. survey indicated growth in jobs, with the
employment index up to 58.6 in July after falling to 57.8 in
June. Government payrolls figures for July are due on Friday.
Many investors are still waiting on an improvement in the
employment situation as a signal of a stronger recovery.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday job
growth was still insufficient to reduce an unemployment rate of
nearly 10 percent, but rising household and business demand
should help sustain economic output despite the fading stimulus
funds. [ID:nWAL2JE6F7]
 U.S. economic growth slipped to an annual rate of 2.4
percent in the second quarter from 3.7 percent in the first,
official figures showed on Friday. That heightened market
concerns about continued U.S. expansion and left investors
betting on China and the rest of Asia to pick up the slack.
 Manufacturing surveys from two other big emerging economies
served to bolster investor sentiment, with India marking its
16th month of expansion and Russia's activity improving for the
seventh month in a row.

 PICKING UP THE SLACK
 Business and consumer sentiment surveys in Europe have been
largely positive over the past month, a trend underpinned on
Monday by forecast-beating earnings from two of the continent's
heavyweight banks, HSBC and BNP Paribas. European stock markets
rose to a three-month high.
 Two weeks ago, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet urged industrial countries to cut public spending
immediately to consolidate the fiscal recovery.
 But his counterpart at the U.S. Federal Reserve, Ben
Bernanke, has instead talked of room for further stimulus to
counter any slowdown.
 Even in fast-growing Asia there are worries the recovery
could lose traction if the authorities in Beijing pull on the
reins too hard, hitting demand in what has become a top export
market for many of China's regional peers.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2010 06:36AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-StanChart sees strong interest in yuan use," HONG KONG, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Standard Chartered Plc is
seeing strong interest from its clients in using the yuan for
trade settlement, a senior executive said on Monday, following
Chinese moves to internationalise its currency.
 There was also growing demand for yuan-denominated products
in Hong Kong and the region, which would help the territory's
yuan market reach the critical mass it needed to function, said
Neil Daswani, the bank's North Asia transaction banking head.
 ""We're seeing strong interest across all client segments,""
Daswani said in an interview. ""Although volumes are still very
low, accounting for less than 1 percent of China's total trade,
this will grow considerably.""
 China and Hong Kong agreed to loosen rules regulating trading
of the yuan in the territory in July, tweaking rules to allow the
sale of yuan-denominated financial products and giving companies
greater access to yuan funds.
 Much of the trade settlement business will come from
companies looking to re-denominate to yuan away from the U.S.
dollar, which most companies operating in China use to pay and
issue invoices.
 Allowing services to be paid for in yuan would also help
expand the use of the currency by companies, Daswani said. Hang
Seng Bank Ltd economists expect yuan settlements to hit about 100
billion yuan ($14.76 billion) by the end of the year, up from
about 45 billion yuan currently.
 Key to expanding the market is increasing two-way yuan
transactions where companies receive and sell in the currency, as
that would allow a natural hedge for companies looking to
minimise foreign exchange risk exposure.
 ""It just doesn't make logical sense to have one of the
world's largest economies doing so much business in another
currency,"" said Daswani. ""The market has responded very
favourably and this will continue.""

 * Old correlations within emerging assets break down
 * Frontier, domestic demand-driven markets favoured

 By Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Investors buying into emerging
markets for a leveraged bet on global growth and portfolio
diversification are having to rethink their strategies as the
integration of major developing markets such as Brazil and China
into the global economy intensifies.
Generating outperformance from what is defined as a riskier
asset class has become more challenging as these fast-expanding
economies become more intertwined with their developed peers.
 More than mere diversification away from mature markets,
portfolio allocations into this asset class will increasingly be
driven by a recognition that emerging equities, currencies and
bonds are moving out of sync with each other.
 ""We've never seen such a meaningful breakdown in
correlations (within emerging markets),"" said Daniel
Tenengauzer, global emerging markets fixed income strategist at
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
 ""If you map out correlations on a six-month basis over the
past 10 years, the breakdown you see in the past three months
have never been there before... We're going to see more of this
because emerging markets are maturing,"" he said.
 But while assets and currencies within the broad spectrum of
emerging markets show an unprecedented idiosyncrasy,
correlations between emerging equities and their
developed-market peers are now higher than during the global
credit crisis.
 More significantly, the beta of emerging equities --
measuring price fluctuations relative to developed markets --
has fallen to one since the start of the year, suggesting that
emerging markets now merely track developed markets.
 Gains are thus likely be modest even when global sentiment
picks up.
 ""The long-term outperformance of emerging markets is a
powerful and secular story but in the short term, it's still
very much risk-on/risk-off,"" said Trevor Greetham, asset
allocation director at Fidelity International.
 Of course there is still a differentiation. The benchmark
MSCI Emerging Markets Index is down 0.3 percent so far this
year, versus a 3.4-percent decline in its global equity
counterpart.
 
 A COMPLICATED WORLD
 Emerging equity funds remain huge money magnets though
allocations to global equities have dipped, EPFR figures show.
 But some investors are pushing out to markets less
integrated with the global economy to generate high-beta returns
that mainstream emerging markets are not providing. 
 Africa and Arab Gulf markets are among the so-called
""frontier markets"" seeing strong interest.
 ""Investors are looking for markets that have low or even
negative correlations to the global market,"" said Mohamed
Al-Hashemi, Head of Asset Management at Invest AD.
 MSCI's Emerging and Frontiers Africa excluding South Africa
Index is up nearly 12 percent this year, beating the S&P 500
Index's 1.2 percent year-to-date decline.
 Domestic-oriented economies such as Turkey and Poland are
also viewed by investors as better positioned to elude the
gravitational pull of any slowdown in the global economy.
 Turkish shares are up 13 percent this year while Polish
stocks have risen 4 percent.
 Outside of equities, the outperformance of other emerging
securities against the global average has been more dramatic.
 So far this year, JPMorgan's sovereign emerging dollar debt
index generated returns of over 9 percent while its
local-currency emerging debt index returned 8 percent.
 Both compare favourably against JPMorgan's GBI Broad Traded
Index, measuring a broad swathe of government debt, which has
returned 2.2 percent this year.
 Such divergent returns from fixed income investments are
perhaps no surprise given that central banks around the world
are now at different stages of the monetary policy cycle after
their coordinated effort to boost liquidity at the height of the
financial crisis.
 With some emerging-market central banks starting to raise
interest rates and others holding them steady, correlations
between currencies that have long moved in tandem will come
under increasing strain.
 The correlation coefficient between Brazil's real currency
and the Mexican peso has fallen to around 0.7, from 0.8 late
June while the measure between the Polish zloty and Turkey's
lira has slipped from last year's historic highs, according to
Benoit Anne, head of emerging markets strategy at Societe
Generale.
 Taking positions on relative-value crosses on currency pairs
such as the lira/South African rand and zloty/Hungarian forint
is one way investors can better differentiate between markets,
Anne said.
 ""The world is a lot more complicated now but you can still
make money,"" he added.

 By Akiko Takeda
 TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely slowed
considerably in the April-June quarter as export growth
moderated and the boost to consumer spending from government
incentives faded, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Monday.
 Second-quarter gross domestic product likely rose 0.6
percent from the previous quarter, or an annualised 2.3 percent,
the poll showed. That would be much slower than the 1.2 percent
quarter-on-quarter, or annualised 5 percent, expansion
registered in January-March.
 A 0.6 percent rise would mark the slowest growth since the
third quarter of last year, though it would mark the fifth
consecutive quarter of expansion.
 ""Japan's high growth so far was brought about by the
government's massive stimulus and a pickup in external demand,""
said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities. ""But the
expansion has likely already taken a breather before there are
signs of a sustained recovery in domestic final demand.""
 Japan's economy expanded faster than the U.S. and European
economies in the first quarter as factory output benefited from
solid exports to Asia and government incentives for purchases of
low-emission cars and electronics.
 But with the effect of such stimulus steps wearing off,
growth in private consumption -- which makes up about 60 percent
of the economy -- is expected to have slowed to 0.1 percent in
the second quarter from 0.4 percent in the previous quarter,
according to the median forecast of the 20 economists polled.
 Net external demand, or exports minus imports, is expected
to have contributed 0.5 percentage point to gross domestic
product, smaller than the first quarter's 0.7 point
contribution.
 ""The export recovery chiefly to Asia has shown signs of
peaking and imports have risen, helping reduce the contribution
from external demand,"" said Akihiro Morishige, an economist at
Mitsubishi Research Institute.
 But economists expect corporate capital spending to have
expanded 0.9 percent, increasing from the 0.6 percent rise in
the previous quarter, as smaller firms have started to benefit
from the recent strength in exports.
 The GDP deflator -- a broad measure of prices -- is seen at
minus 1.8 percent, improving from a record minus 2.8 percent in
the first quarter but still suggesting that deflation remains a
threat to the fragile economy.
 Many economists expect a further economic slowdown in coming
quarters, with some even predicting a contraction, as many
government subsidies are set to expire. A stronger yen,
tightening steps in China and signs of a slowdown in the United
States and Europe are also expected to weigh on growth.
 Following are economists' forecasts for the preliminary
April-June GDP data:

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - World stocks kicked off August in
a strong mood on Monday as upbeat results from BNP Paribas
 and HSBC  boosted optimism for corporate
earnings and the economic outlook for the rest of the year.
 BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, rose 5 percent
after posting higher-than-expected second-quarter net profit
thanks to lower loan provisions and strong retail banking which
offset the impact on its business of volatile financial markets.
 HSBC said its half-year profits hit $11.1 billion, more than
double the $5 billion a year ago, sending shares up more than 5
percent.
 Optimism that corporate earnings will maintain the momentum
of the global economic recovery even after recent weakness in
U.S. data encouraged broad risk taking, pushing world stocks
towards last week's 2-1/2 month high.
 ""The earnings season is doing the trick,"" said Heino Ruland,
strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt. ""The results are
better than expected.""
MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1 percent,
while the Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> added
0.8 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> gained 1.9 percent.
 Royal Bank of Scotland , whose shares rose 4 percent,
reports its first-half results on Friday.
 ""HSBC are certainly raising the bar in terms of expectations
for the rest,"" said Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at
Hargreaves Lansdown.
 Tokyo stocks <.N225> rose 0.3 percent, with shares of Canon
<7751.T> jumping nearly 6 percent at one point after the world's
No. 1 camera maker reported its best profit in seven quarters.
 Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 1.5 percent to a three-month
high.
 U.S. stock futures rose around 1.2 percent , pointing
to a firmer open on Wall Street, which posted its biggest
monthly gain in a year last month.
 U.S. crude oil  gained 1.2 percent to $79.87 a barrel.
 The bund futures  fell 32 ticks.
 The low-yielding dollar <.DXY> fell to a three-month low
against a basket of major currencies. The euro ticked higher to
$1.3070 . Other higher-yielding, commodity-linked
currencies rose broadly.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The dollar-index hit a three-month
low on Monday, hurt by worries that the U.S. economy's recovery
is losing steam, while the high-yielding Australian dollar
reached a three-month high, buoyed by a rise in Asian equities.
 The dollar has been hobbled by concerns over the U.S.
economy after a series of recent economic data undershot market
expectations, while European numbers and many company results
have been stronger -- keeping investors buying riskier assets.
 Analysts said the perceived better risk sentiment outside of
the United States was unlikely to be maintained if the world's
biggest economy continues to underperform.
 ""We're seeing a disconnection as U.S. data stays weak yet
risk appetite is strong. Weak U.S. data will translate into risk
aversion at some point,"" said Tom Levinson, fx strategist at
ING.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of currencies, hit a three-month low of 81.371
, dipping below support near 81.44, which is roughly a 50
percent retracement of its November to June rally.
 Next support lies at the 200-day moving average at 80.701.

 At 0740 GMT, the euro was up 0.2 percent from late U.S.
trading on Friday to $1.3070, near a three-month high of $1.3107
marked last week. 
 Key resistance was at $1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement
of the fall from late November to early June, while options
traders noted barriers in place at $1.3200, $1.3250 and $1.3300,
said to expire from the end of August into early September.
 Sterling hit a 5-1/2 month high versus the dollar of $1.5763
and managed to outpace the euro, rising to a 4-week high of
82.81 pence.
 
 AUSSIE RISES, YEN SLIPS
 The dollar also fell against the high-yielding Australian
and New Zealand dollars, with the Australian dollar hitting a
three-month peak at $0.9119.
 The Australian dollar was buoyed by gains for Asian equities
with MSCI's broad measure of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
up 1.7 percent. 
 ""It's a very typical pattern we see when investor risk
appetite is improving, with the yen and the dollar weakening,
while the Australian and New Zealand dollars strengthen,"" said
Junya Tanase, chief FX strategist for JPMorgan Chase Bank in
Tokyo.
 The yen slipped broadly and pulled back a bit from an
eight-month high versus the dollar hit late last week.
 The dollar edged up 0.3 percent to 86.75 yen. It had struck
an eight-month low of 85.95 yen after U.S. GDP data on Friday
showed growth slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second
quarter.
 A drop below 84.82 yen on trading platform EBS would take
the greenback to its lowest in 15 years against the yen.
 With the yen still hovering near last week's eight-month
peak against the dollar and getting close to a 15-year peak,
Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday that
excessive currency moves are undesirable and can have a negative
impact on the economy.

 By Sudip Kar-Gupta
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Tullett Prebon, the world's
second-biggest interdealer broker, could attract another bidder
although no takeover talks were now under way, Chief Executive
Terry Smith told Reuters on Monday.
 He also said in an interview he expected revenues to improve
in the remainder of the year after Tullett posted a widely
expected fall in half-year profits due partly to the departure
of brokers to a rival and adverse currency movements.
 In May, Tullett said talks with a possible buyer had ended
with no offer made for the company. It did not reveal the
identity of its potential suitor.
 Smith said current regulations sweeping the world's
financial sector, such as the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, meant it was
likely that Tullett could attract new suitors.
 ""I think the Dodd-Frank bill will make the interdealer
broker business more attractive than it was before,"" Smith said.
 ""Do I think there's the possibility of further talks with
people? Yes. It wouldn't surprise us if talks resumed at some
point, but there's absolutely nothing going on at present.""
 
 INTERIM PROFITS FALL
 Tullett's operating profit for the six months ended June 30
fell 15.8 percent from last year to 84.7 million pounds ($132.3
million). The mean estimate for the operating profit stood at
81.5 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
 Tullett shares were up 2.9 percent at 350.1 pence in early
morning trade, giving the company a market capitalisation of
around 754 million pounds.
 Tullett said the recent departure of some of its brokers to
rival BGC Partners had contributed to a 7 percent fall in
revenue, while its earnings had also been hit by adverse foreign
exchange movements.
 Last month ICAP, the world's biggest interdealer broker,
reported higher quarterly revenues and profits but said trade
volumes had slowed down significantly.
 Smith said he expected Tullett's second-half profits to be
lower than those of the first half but higher than its
second-half profit a year ago. It made a 2009 second-half
operating profit of roughly 70 million pounds.
 Smith added that the company could consider making further
small-scale acquisitions, such as its takeover of Brazilian
interdealer broker Convencao which is due to be completed this
year.

 By Alan Wheatley and Zhou Xin
 BEIJING, Aug 2 (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector
cooled further in July, even shrinking by one measure, but
markets took the news as a sign of a desired slowdown rather
than a harbinger of a slump that could derail global recovery.
 Manufacturing surveys from other big emerging economies
India and Russia, also served to bolster investor sentiment,
with Asia's third-largest economy marking its 16th month of
expansion and Russia's activity improving for the seventh month
in a row.
 HSBC survey of Chinese companies showed on Monday that
manufacturing activity fell for the first time since the depths
of the global downturn in March 2009, while a similar
government survey published on Sunday showed a marked dip in
growth.
 A marked slowdown in U.S. growth in the second quarter
heightened market concerns about the strength of recovery in
the world's biggest economy, leaving investors betting on China
and the rest of Asian to pick up the slack.
 One concern is that Asia, which has led the economic
recovery, could lose traction if the authorities in Beijing
pulled on the reins too hard, hitting demand in what has become
a top export market for many of China's regional peers.
 The economy already slowed markedly from April to June,
expanding at a 10.3 percent annual clip after 11.9 percent
growth in the first quarter.
 HSBC, however, played down fears that world's prime growth
engine, poised to overtake Japan this year as the second
largest economy, might be sputtering.
 ""We still expect the economy to grow by around 9 percent in
the second half of 2010 and 2011, driven by resilient private
consumption and continued investment demands of ongoing
infrastructure and new public housing construction projects,""
HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Sun Junwei said in a note.
 CONTROLLED SLOWDOWN
 An index based on a nationwide survey of business
executives conducted for HSBC dropped to 49.4 from 50.4 in
June, while one compiled by China' statistics bureau fell to a
17-month low of 51.2 from 52.1 in June.
 With surveys still seen fitting a scenario of a controlled
slowdown resulting from government efforts to prevent
overheating, financial markets took the data in stride.
 The Japanese yen and Australian dollar barely budged, while
an index of Asian stocks outside Japan edged up following the
report.
 India's HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers' Index, bounced
back in July, driven by new orders and stronger factory output,
rising to 57.6 in July from 57.3 in June when it slipped from a
multi-year high.
 ""India is on a roll. The economy was given another leg up
in July as new orders continued to pour in. Even the export
sector appears to be holding up well, despite worries over
cooling demand abroad,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian
Economics Research at HSBC.
 In Russia, the headline index crept up to 52.7 from 52.6 on
the back of rising orders and employment.
 South Korea's trade data out on Sunday also helped boost
confidence with exports growing by nearly 30 percent from a
year earlier in July, beating market expectations.
 The country's PMI manufacturing index eased slightly in
July, but remained comfortably above the no change threshold.
 In another sign of the region's strength Australia's PMI
gauge rose on the back of growth in orders and output.
 U.S. manufacturing PMI, due at 1400 GMT, is expected to
drop to 54.1 in July from 56.2 in June, and will follow
Friday's gross domestic product data that showed economic
growth slipping to 2.4 percent in the second quarter from 3.7
percent in the first.
 In contrast, the euro zone, dogged by lingering anxiety
about high levels of sovereign debt, is showing remarkable
resilience.
 The July manufacturing PMI index due around 0800 GMT is
seen at 56.5, unchanged from June and well in the growth
territory.
 On Friday, Belgium reported economic growth of 0.7 percent
in the past quarter after a stagnant performance in the first
quarter.
 While Belgium is only the euro area's sixth-largest economy
it is the first to report its GDP data and it is often seen as
bellwether for the single currency area because of its trade
and business links with bigger EU partners.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The high-yielding Australian dollar
rose on Monday helped by a rise in equities, while the dollar
hit a three-month low against a basket of currencies, hurt by
persistent worries that the U.S. economy's recovery is losing
steam.
 The dollar has been hobbled by concerns over the U.S.
economy after a series of recent economic data undershot market
expectations, and its slide has been exacerbated by some bearish
signals on technical charts.
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of currencies, hit a three-month low of 81.400,
dipping below support near 81.44, which is roughly a 50 percent
retracement of its November to June rally.
 The outlook for the dollar index turned bearish in early
July on daily Ichimoku charts, a form of technical analysis
particularly popular among Japanese traders, and its next
support lies at the 200-day moving average at 80.701.
 ""For now, I think the overall trend of dollar weakness still
remains in place,"" said a trader for a European bank.
 Sterling briefly touched a five-month high of $1.5735 in
early Asian trade on Monday.
 The euro edged up 0.3 percent from late U.S. trading on
Friday to $1.3085, edging back towards a three-month high of
$1.3107 marked last week. One trader cited talk of relatively
large stop-loss bids in the euro in the $1.3120 to $1.3150
region.
 AUSSIE RISES, YEN SLIPS
 The dollar also fell against the high-yielding Australian
and New Zealand dollars, with the Australian dollar hitting a
three-month peak at $0.9108.
 After trimming some gains, the Australian dollar was 0.6
percent higher compared with late U.S. trading on Friday at
$0.9095.
 ""U.S. interest rates have been falling, which is leading to
reflation trade and helping to boost commodity prices. So it
makes sense to buy commodity-linked currencies like the Aussie
dollar,"" said Hideki Amikura, forex manager at Nomura Trust and
Banking.
 Higher Asian equities helped lift the Australian dollar,
market players also said. MSCI's broad measure of Asia-Pacific
shares outside Japan rose 1.6 percent.
 ""It's a very typical pattern we see when investor risk
appetite is improving, with the yen and the dollar weakening,
while the Australian and New Zealand dollars strengthen,"" said
Junya Tanase, chief FX strategist for JPMorgan Chase Bank in
Tokyo.
 High-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar tend
to benefit when investor risk appetite rises, while funding
currencies such as the low-yielding yen and dollar tend to fall.
 The yen slipped broadly and pulled back a bit from an
eight-month high versus the dollar hit late last week.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 86.52 yen. On Friday, the
dollar struck an eight-month low of 85.95 yen on trading
platform EBS after U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product
(GDP) data showed U.S. growth slowed to a 2.4 percent annual
rate in the second quarter.
 A drop below 84.82 yen on trading platform EBS would take
the greenback to its lowest in 15 years against the yen.
 With the yen still hovering near last week's eight-month
peak against the dollar and getting close to a 15-year peak,
Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday that
excessive currency moves are undesirable and can have a negative
impact on the economy.
 Market players have said they do not seriously expect
Japanese authorities to intervene to stem yen strength until it
rises to 15-year highs.
 Japanese authorities will likely turn to further Bank of
Japan liquidity provision steps or monetary easing before
considering any yen-selling intervention, which they last
conducted in March 2004, market players said.
 Traders and analysts say Japanese authorities may consider
currency intervention only if the yen's rise gains more speed
and Tokyo shares slide.

 High-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar tend
to benefit when investor risk appetite rises, while funding
currencies such as the low-yielding yen and dollar tend to fall.
 The yen slipped broadly and pulled back a bit from an
eight-month high versus the dollar hit late last week.
 The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 86.58 yen. On Friday, the
dollar struck an eight-month low of 85.95 yen on trading platform
EBS after U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data
showed U.S. growth slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter.
 A drop below 84.82 yen on trading platform EBS would take the
greenback to its lowest in 15 years against the yen.
 With the yen still hovering near last week's eight-month peak
against the dollar and getting close to a 15-year peak, Japanese
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday that excessive
currency moves are undesirable and can have a negative impact on
the economy.
 Market players have said they do not seriously expect
Japanese authorities to intervene to stem yen strength until it
rises to 15-year highs.
 Japanese authorities will likely turn to further Bank of
Japan liquidity provision steps or monetary easing before
considering any yen-selling intervention, which they last
conducted in March 2004, market players said.
 Traders and analysts say Japanese authorities may consider
currency intervention only if the yen's rise gains more speed and
Tokyo shares slide.

 TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister on Monday
stepped up his warnings on big currency moves as the dollar
hovered near an eight-month low versus the yen due to growing
signs that the U.S. economy is slowing.
 The dollar stood near 86.46 yen, close to an eight-month low
of 85.95 yen hit on Friday after U.S. gross domestic product
slowed more than expected in the second quarter.
 The greenback is within striking distance of a 14-year high

Yoshihiko Noda told reporters.
 ""From that standpoint, we are watching currency moves
closely.""
 Noda's comments seemed stronger than those he made on Friday,
when he simply said excessive currency moves are undesirable.
 Japan's authorities intervened heavily earlier in the decade
to stop a rising yen from harming exports but they quit in March
2004 at the end of a 15-month long spree in which they sold 35
trillion yen ($404.8 billion) to try to shield a struggling
economy.

 TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a
three-month low against a basket of currencies on Monday and was
seen stuck in a downtrend due to concerns that the U.S. economy's
recovery was losing momentum.
 The dollar has been hobbled by worries over the U.S. economy
after a series of U.S. economic data in the past month undershot
market expectations, and its slide has been exacerbated by some
bearish signals on technical charts.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a
basket of major currencies, stood at 81.550, hovering just above
a three-month low of 81.459 hit on Friday.
 The index was also holding just above support near 81.44,
which is roughly a 50 percent retracement of its rally from its
November 2009 trough to a peak hit in June.
 ""For now, I think the overall trend of dollar weakness still
remains in place,"" said a trader for a European bank.
 The yen could get a boost with the dollar on the defensive,
the trader said.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent from late U.S. trading on
Friday to 86.49 yen, having hit an eight-month low of 85.95 yen
on trading platform EBS on Friday after U.S. second-quarter gross
domestic product (GDP) data showed U.S. growth slowed to a 2.4
percent annual rate in the second quarter.
 Dollar bears had sold the dollar against the yen on Friday
after the Q2 GDP data, which came in slightly below market
expectations for 2.5 percent growth. Growth in the first quarter,
however, was revised up to 3.7 percent.
 A drop below 84.82 yen on trading platform EBS would take the
dollar to its lowest in 15 years against the yen.
 With the yen hovering near last week's eight-month peak
against the dollar and getting close to a 15-year peak, Japanese
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday that excessive
currency moves are undesirable and can have a negative impact on
the economy.
 Market players have said they will not seriously expect
Japanese authorities to intervene to stem yen strength until it
rises to 15-year highs beyond 84.82 to the dollar, and that the
yen's rise would also need to gain more steam and a slide in
Tokyo shares would have to deepen.
 The Australian dollar edged up 0.5 percent and hit a
three-month high of $0.9087, partly on relief that Chinese
manufacturing data released on Sunday was not as weak as feared.
 Sterling briefly touched a five-month high of $1.5735 in
early Asian trading on Monday.
 The euro held steady from late U.S. trading on Friday at
$1.3065.

 By Nevzat Devranoglu
 IZMIR, Turkey, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Turkey's exports rose 5.97
percent year-on-year in July to $9.42 billion, the Turkish
Exporters' Assembly (TIM) said on Sunday.
 The TIM figures come almost a month before official
statistics institute trade data, which they tend to match.
 Turkey's exports have risen 13.14 percent to $64.24 billion
in the January-July period, the assembly said.
 TIM Chairman Mehmet Buyukeksi said the appreciation of the
lira had cut demand for Turkish goods, causing exports to fall
short of the assembly's forecast double-digit rise for the
month.
 Buyukeksi said he expected around a 10 percent year-on-year
rise every month starting from September to the end of the year.
 The Turkish automobile sector, the country's leading
exporter, saw sales abroad rise 25.3 percent to $10.15 billion
in the January to July period. Textile exports rose 12.5 percent
to $8.35 billion.

 SEOUL, Aug 1 (Reuters) - South Korean exports in July grew
faster than expected, easing concerns that the appetite for the
country's manufactured goods may be cooling in line with
worries about economic growth in China and the U.S.
 The strong data on Sunday cemented views that South Korea's
central bank may raise interest rates again this year. A rate
hike and South Korea's expected $30 billion trade surplus will
add pressure on the won  to appreciate, economists said.
 ""There are no reasons for the Bank of Korea to delay a rate
hike,"","" said Kim Jae-eun, an economist at Hyundai Securities.
""Today's export data indicated that recent worries about a
global double dip were groundless.""
 South Korea's exports rose 29.6 percent in July over a year
earlier, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said. This beat the
median forecasts of a 26.9 percent growth in a Reuters' survey
of 10 analysts.
 Daily average export value per working day fell to $1.69
billion in July from a revised $1.82 billion in June. But a
ministry official said July's figure was still higher than the
$1.64 billion so far this year.
 South Korea's trade data are closely watched by investors
as the country is the first major exporting economy in Asia to
report monthly figures. China, the European Union and the
United States bought 48 percent of South Korea's exports.
 EXPORTS TO CHINA, US GROW FASTER
 Exports to China, which takes about a quarter of exports,
increased 36.8 percent in the first 20 days of July from a year
ago versus a 25.3 percent rise in the first 20 days of June.
 Exports to the European Union, which takes about 12 percent
of South Korea's exports, jumped 56.9 percent during the same
period. Exports to the U.S., which account for about 11 percent
of the country's exports, increased 49.3 percent in the July
1-20 period, compared with 24.2 percent growth in June.
 ""The U.S. and Chinese economic growth is slowing but it is
not strong enough to hit the Korean economy hard,"" said Song
Jae-hyeok, an economist at SK Securities.
 U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter as
companies invested heavily in equipment from abroad and the
pace of consumer spending eased, raising concerns about the
recovery in the rest of 2010. [ID:nN30215488]
 South Korean semiconductor exports in July jumped 71
percent from a year earlier. Auto exports rose 50 percent.
Exports of liquid crystal devices gained 30 percent.
 Semiconductors account for about 8 percent of the country's
exports and cars account for some 11 percent. South Korea is
the home of the world's top memory chipmaker Samsung
Electronics <005930.KS> and the world's fifth-largest car maker
Hyundai Motor Group <005380.KS> <000270.KS>.
 South Korean imports grew 28.9 percent in July over a year
earlier, below market forecasts of a 32.0 percent.
 That helped Asia's fourth-largest economy produce a $5.67
billion trade surplus last month, compared with a revised $6.43
billion.
 On Saturday, Economy Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said the
country was on course to achieve a $30 billion trade surplus by
the end of the year. [ID:nN30244619]

(Adds details, comments from ex-PM, manufacturers)
 DHAKA, July 31 (Reuters) - At least 100 people were injured
when garment workers attacked factories and vehicles in
Bangladesh on Saturday in a second day of protests to demand
higher wages, police and witnesses said.
 Police fired rubber bullets and used teargas and batons
against workers blocking roads in the capital Dhaka's suburbs.
 This week the government set the minimum monthly wage to
3,000 taka ($43). Workers are demanding 5,000 taka.
 Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made a plea for calm.
 ""Who will benefit if the (garment) industry is destroyed?
The workers should not involve themselves in any activity that
might put their own source of bread at risk,"" Hasina's press
secretary, Abul Kalam Azad, quoted her as saying.
 The garment industry is Bangladesh's second biggest employer
after agriculture, and accounts for more than 80 percent of the
impoverished country's annual export earnings of $16 billion.
 Saturday's protests started in Ashulia, an industrial area
30 km (19 miles) north of the capital.
 ""Several policemen were also injured, as they clashed with
workers, trying to dispel attacks on their vans,"" a local
newspaper reporter at the scene told Reuters.
 The workers beat and seriously injured a cameraman working
for a local television channel when he tried to film them. They
also damaged and looted machines and ready-to-wear garments from
a number of factories, witnesses said.
 Police have so far detained 25 people.
 Protesters also blocked a road at Fatulla, 16 km east of
Dhaka, and more than 50 people were hurt in clashes with police.
 
 BLAME
 Protest leaders blamed police for sparking violence by
assaulting workers during peaceful rallies.
 Begum Khaleda Zia, former prime minister and chief of the
main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, speaking at a
party meeting blamed ""wrong government policies for the ongoing
anarchy in the garment sector"".
 Leaders of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters
Association (BGMEA) demanded order be restored and threatened to
close down factories if vandalism continues.
 ""We will be compelled to close down factories if government
fails to give us protection,"" BGMEA vice president Faruque
Hassan told Reuters. He said criminals disguised as workers had
looted factories and wayside shops during the clashes.
 BGMEA represents some 4,500 garment factories, that employ
more 3.5 million workers, mostly women.
 Bangladesh-based factories make garments for international
brands such JC Penney, Wal-Mart, H&M, Kohl's, Marks & Spencer,
Zara and Carrefour.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 07:12PM ET</span>",Cuba readies to dive into offshore oil exploration," (Fixes typo in lead)
 * Offshore drilling rig expected in Cuba in early 2011
 * Oil companies preparing for full-scale exploration
 * U.S. companies forbidden by U.S. trade embargo
 By Jeff Franks
 HAVANA, July 30 (Reuters) - A Chinese-built drilling rig is
expected to arrive in Cuban waters in early 2011, likely
opening the way for full-scale exploration of the island's
untapped offshore fields.
 Companies with contracts to search for oil and gas in
Cuba's portion of the Gulf of Mexico have already begun
preparations to drill once the Scarabeo 9 rig gets to the
communist-led island.
 An official with Saipem, a unit of Italian oil company Eni
SpA  told Reuters on Friday the massive semi-submersible
rig should be completed at the Yantai Raffles 
shipyard in Yantai, China by the end of this year.
 The journey to Cuba will take two months, and once it
arrives it will be put into operation almost immediately, said
the official, who asked not to be identified.
 It will be used first as an exploratory well for a
consortium led by Spanish oil giant Repsol YPF 
, which drilled the only offshore well in Cuba in 2004
and said at the time it had found hydrocarbons.
 Cuba has said it may have 20 billion barrels of oil in its
offshore, but the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated a more
modest 4.6 billion barrels and 10 trillion cubic feet of gas.
 Repsol has been mostly silent on the long delay in drilling
more wells, but it is widely assumed in the oil industry it was
due to the longstanding U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.
 The embargo limits the amount of U.S. technology that can
be used, which complicates finding equipment because U.S.
companies have long dominated the offshore oil business.
 Construction of the Scarabeo 9 was begun by Norwegian firm
Frigstad Discoverer Invest Limited in 2006, but the company was
purchased by Saipem in 2007. The rig was due to be completed by
September 2009, but has been delayed because of modifications
requested by Saipem, the Saipem official said.
 PREPARATIONS UNDERWAY
 The official said it was also slowed because the shipyard
""had taken on too much work"" with other projects.
 Repsol is said to be planning at least one exploration well
and possibly another. The rig will then be passed to other
companies with contracts to drill in Cuban waters.
 Cuba's portion of the Gulf of Mexico has been divided into
59 blocks, of which 17 have been contracted to companies
including Repsol, Malaysia's Petronas , Brazil's
Petrobras (PETR4.SA) (PBR.N), Venezuela's PDVSA and
PetroVietnam.
 Repsol is partnering with Norway's Statoil 
and ONGC Videsh Limited, a unit of India's Oil and Natural Gas
Corp .
 Diplomats in Havana have said Malaysia's Petronas will get
the rig next, after Repsol completes its drilling.
 Petronas, which has four exploration blocks, has conducted
seismic work and built offices for a battery of employees who
will come to Cuba for the project, sources said.
 It also is talking to a possible partner in Gazprom Neft
, the oil arm of Russian energy company Gazprom
, whose chief told shareholders last month the company
wants to join Petronas in the Cuba project.
 ONGC Videsh, which has two blocks of its own, separate from
its consortium with Repsol and Statoil, has already solicited
bids for equipment including sub-sea wellheads and casing pipes
for its planned exploration.
 Russian oil firm Zarubezhneft has two nearshore blocks it
said it plans to drill next year, but also has an agreement
with Petrovietnam to participate in exploration of its three
offshore blocks.
 Zarubezhneft opened an office in Havana in June, according
to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti.
 A number of international oil service companies have
solicited information about Cuban regulations on issues ranging
from safety equipment to finance and taxes, diplomats said.
 OIL SPILL CONCERNS
 Cuba's state-owned oil company Cupet has been silent about
the offshore activity and rejected requests for interviews. A
government official said the requests were denied because Cupet
did not want to speak during the BP oil spill in the Gulf.
 The spill has never reached Cuba, but it has heightened
safety concerns both in the government and among oil companies
with offshore blocks, sources said.
 The prospect of drilling in Cuban waters has also raised
pollution fears in Florida, which is just 50 miles (80 km) away
from the island's maritime boundary.
 The Saipem official said the Scarabeo 9, which is capable
of operating in water depths up to 3,600 meters (11,811 feet),
is built to Norwegian standards, meaning it has extra equipment
to shut off blown-out wells not required in the United States.
 Due to the U.S. trade embargo, U.S. oil companies are not
allowed to operate in Cuba.
 Later this month a group from the Houston-based
International Association of Drilling Contractors is scheduled
to visit Cuba. The group has said it wants to discuss offshore
safety issues with Cuban officials and get an overview of
deepwater prospects.
 Despite five decades of hostile relations, Cuba has said it
would welcome the involvement of U.S. companies in developing
its offshore fields.
 Oil expert Jorge Pinon at Florida International University
in Miami said U.S. oil service companies would like to enter
the Cuban market because it is a new market close to home.
 ""For the U.S. offshore oil industry, Cuba is basically an
extension of the Gulf of Mexico. It's not like Angola -- they
can provide service from Houston or Freeport or Mobile.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the U.S.
dollar slid on Friday as investors trimmed risk exposure on
data showing the U.S. economy slowing a bit more than expected
even as other news suggested a slow, steady recovery.
 The dollar hit its lowest since November against the
Japanese yen as data showing U.S. gross domestic product slowed
in the second quarter reinforced expectations for low U.S.
interest rates well into next year. For details see:
[ID:nN30213194]
 The dollar's weakness helped crude oil to rebound and drive
strong rallies in wheat and sugar, which lifted the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global commodities
benchmark, to its biggest monthly gain in July in 14 months.
[ID:nN30206005]
 The U.S. Commerce Department said GDP expanded at a 2.4
percent annual rate in the second quarter, less than the 2.5
percent pace analysts polled by Reuters had expected.
 But European stocks recovered from a sharp fall to close
only slightly lower and U.S. stocks pared losses on separate,
mixed signals from U.S. data to close flat. [ID:nLDE66T1LY]
[ID:nN30181238]
 A jump in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index to 62.3 in
July suggested a slow but steady economic recovery was spurring
buying. Analysts expected a reading of 56.5.
 A separate report showed consumer sentiment slumped to an
8-month low, emblematic of a fragile economy.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI's all-country world index
<.MIWD00000PUS> and its emerging market index <.MSCIEF> both
pared losses to fall about 0.2 percent.
 Wall Street closed little changed to wrap up its best month
in a year after another week of strong corporate results that
offset the impact of lackluster economic data.
 The 7 percent gain in July for the S&P 500 and Dow was on
low volume and followed an almost 14 percent decline through
May and June.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 1.22
points, or 0.01 percent, at 10,465.94. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 0.07 point, or 0.01 percent, at
1,101.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 3.01 points,
or 0.13 percent, to 2,254.70.
 ""The market kind of stalled up the last couple of days,""
said Nick Kalivas, an analyst MF Global. ""On the surface
earnings numbers have been pretty strong but underneath there
was a loss of momentum,"" he said.
 The dollar fell 2.2 percent against the yen  in July,
the third straight month of declines, while the euro rose 6.7
percent  against the dollar, its best month since May
2009.
 ""It's going to be very difficult for a (dollar) rally and
people are going to get more risk averse. You could see euro go
below $1.30 and the dollar fall below 86 yen,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT Forex in New York.
 Copper led industrial commodities in July with a gain of
12.4 percent, its biggest in a year.
 Money managers more than doubled their long, or bullish
exposure, in U.S. copper futures this week as prices hit peaks
last seen in May, trade data released on Friday showed.
 Gold lost about 5 percent in July, its biggest monthly loss
since December, as safe-haven demand fizzled on lessening fears
over a euro zone sovereign debt crisis. [ID:nLDE66T0UX]
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$12.70, or 1.1 percent, at $1,183.90 on Friday.
 Oil rebounded from losses that pushed benchmark crude below
$77 a barrel.
 U.S. crude for September  delivery rose 59 cents to
settle at $78.95 a barrel. ICE Brent also rose 59 cents to
settle at $78.18 a barrel.
 U.S. Treasuries rose on growing expectations for more
accommodative monetary policy, with the benchmark 10-year note
yield falling within roughly two basis points of a 15-month low
and the two-year yield setting a new record low.
 Bond prices move inversely to their yield.
 The 2-year Treasury note  fell to a record low of
0.559 percent. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 was up 21/32 in price to yield 2.91 percent.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - The dollar hit its lowest
since November against the Japanese yen on Friday as data
showed growth in the world's largest economy is slowing,
reinforcing expectations for low U.S. interest rates into
2011.
 Dollar bears sold the U.S. currency against the yen after
the government said in its first estimate that U.S. gross
domestic product expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the
second quarter after an upwardly revised 3.7 percent pace in
the January-March quarter.
Analysts said Friday's report follows a string of weak data
from the United States that has weighed broadly on the dollar.
They added that the data may also hurt demand for perceived
riskier assets, favoring investments in currencies such as the
yen and the Swiss franc.
 The dollar fell 2.2 percent against the yen in July, the
third straight month of declines, while the euro rose 6.7
percent against the dollar for the month -- its best month
since May 2009 -- snapping seven straight months of declines.
 ""It's going to be very difficult for a (dollar) rally and
people are going to get more risk averse. You could see euro go
below $1.30 and the dollar fall below 86 yen,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT Forex in New York.
 The GDP report ""is not helpful to the risk trade or the
dollar-yen since we're seeing across all U.S. data releases
signs that the U.S. economy really is stuck in the mud,"" he
added.
 In late afternoon trade in New York on Friday, the dollar
was down 0.4 percent at 86.38 yen after hitting an eight-month
low of 85.95 yen following the GDP report, according to
Reuters. It was the third day of declines for the dollar
against the yen.
 Stop-loss sales were triggered earlier at a previous low of
86.25 yen, traders said.
 ""We're in a small window where U.S. economic data is
underperforming and keeping pressure on the dollar,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""Concerns about the U.S. economy and Fed easing will also
put U.S. yields on the downside, which is a key driver for
dollar/yen,"" he said.
 The dollar pared some of its losses against the yen after
another report showed a jump in business activity in the U.S.
Midwest in July, but the relief was short-lived.
 RISING YEN
 The yen took comments by Japanese Finance Minister
Yoshihiko Noda that he was closely watching the market in
stride. Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda said he was
worried about the impact of a rising yen on Japan's exports.
 But traders and analysts said they do not expect Japanese
authorities to intervene to stem the yen's rise until it goes
beyond 84.81 yen to the dollar, hit in November 2009, according
to Reuters data. That was a 14-1/2-year high for the yen.
 The dollar also fell to a six-month low against the Swiss
franc at 1.0364 francs, but it was last little changed. The
euro fell 0.6 percent against the yen to 112.78 yen and 0.2
percent against the dollar to $1.3053 on Friday.
 Traders said the euro's fall against the yen was related to
redemption flows from Spanish bonds.
 The euro's recovery to an 11-week high against the dollar
earlier in the week was partly driven by rising euro zone money
market rates, which fell on Friday.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 03:12PM ET</span>","UPDATE 2-IMF, Spain differ over pace of economic recovery"," 
 * Spain's recovery will be fragile and weak
 * IMF thinks fiscal goals based on overly optimistic view
 * IMF says Madrid sees staff forecasts as too pessimistic
 (Recasts; adds details, quotes)
 By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, July 30 (Reuters) - The IMF cautioned Spain on
Friday that its deficit-reduction goals rely on overly
optimistic economic forecasts and its budget picture will
darken if the economy proves weaker than the government
expects.
 In its annual review of the Spanish economy, the
International Monetary Fund forecast a more sluggish recovery
in the recession-hit Spanish economy than the government had.
 The IMF said Spain's recovery would be ""fragile and weak""
with domestic demand weighed down by high unemployment -- the
highest in the euro zone -- and budget cuts.
 Earlier this year, investors feared Spain would follow
Greece into a sovereign debt crisis. Those worries have eased
and the government has had no problem raising money and paying
its bills.
 The IMF projected the economy will shrink this year by 0.4
percent, before growth resumes at a tepid 0.6 percent next
year, rising to 1.7 percent in 2012. Compared, the government
sees the economy contracting 0.3 percent this year before 1.3
percent growth in 2011.
 The Fund said Spain's budget-tightening plans were
correctly front-loaded, with nearly two-thirds of the needed
adjustment achieved by 2011.
 ""But the envisaged adjustment is based on potentially
optimistic macroeconomic projections,"" IMF staff added.
 It is imperative to get ahead of markets with a pro-active,
comprehensive and credible deficit-reduction strategy, the IMF
said, warning that any delays would not only have implications
for Spain but also the rest of Europe.
 ""The government should thus make the achievement of their
targets more credible and aggressively pre-empt any
slippage,"" the Fund said.
 ""Macroeconomic projections should be made more prudent and
additional measures prepared to ensure the targets are
attained,"" it added.
 Based on policies already announced, IMF staff projected
that the fiscal deficit will decline to 9.3 percent of gross
domestic product in 2010, in line with the government's
target.
 However, IMF staff sees the deficit falling to only 7
percent of GDP next year, which is one percent of GDP above the
government's target.
 In 2012, the IMF forecasts a deficit of 6.6 percent versus
the government target of 4.4 percent. In 2013, it sees the
budget gap at 5.9 percent, nearly double the 3 percent target
envisaged by the government.
 ""The differences arise from (the IMF) staff's less buoyant
macroeconomic projections, which are also subject to
significant downside risk,"" the Fund said..
 The report said the Spanish authorities thought the IMF
projections were too pessimistic and contend the recovery is
likely to be stronger than IMF envisages.

 * USTR still ""studying"" WTO case on China currency
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, Pa. July 30 (Reuters) - President Barack
Obama's national security advisors have not stopped U.S. trade
officials from filing legal challenges against China, U.S.
Trade Representative Ron Kirk said on Friday.
 ""We've not experienced any instances at all where we have
made a recommendation to the president and there's been any
objection or interference from the NSC (National Security
Council),"" Kirk told reporters after a speech on U.S. trade
enforcement at a specialty steel manufacturer.
 U.S. trade officials were ""studying"" the possibility of
bring a WTO challenge against China's currency practices, but
had not made a decision yet, Kirk added.
 Kirk was asked whether White House national security
officials, for larger strategic reasons of maintaining good
relations with China, were blocking three cases that have been
reported to be in the works for months.
 Kirk insisted his agency ""solely has the responsibility to
make decisions on U.S. trade policy,"" but greatly values the
advice it receives from other agencies, including the NSC and
the White House National Economic Council.
 The Obama administration has filed just one WTO complaint
against China since taking office in January 2009.
 That was brought with the European Union and Mexico against
Chinese export restraints on raw materials used to make steel,
semi-conductors and other manufactured goods.
 One of three possible new cases Kirk was asked about on
Friday involves a specialty steel product made by Allegheny
Technologies Inc, which hosted him for his speech.
 The company's grain-oriented electrical steel, which is
used in high-efficiency transformers, electric motors and
generators, was hit this year with Chinese anti-dumping and
countervailing duties it says are unjustified.
 The second possible new case would challenge Chinese export
restraints on rare earths, a raw material used in many advanced
technology products including defense and clean energy goods.
 The third would take on China Union Pay's monopoly on
electronic payments in apparent violation of commitments China
made when it joined the WTO.
 ""I just don't think it's smart policy to talk about
specific cases that we're contemplating,"" Kirk said, when asked
about the three possible disputes.
 However, a second senior U.S. trade official, speaking on
condition that he not be identified, confirmed the USTR has
""taken a good close look at each of those.""
 Kirk said the United States hopes to resolve a number of
trade issues with Beijing by the time he and Commerce Secretary
Gary Locke host senior Chinese officials in November for the
U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.
 He also said the Obama administration would not hesitate to
impose punitive tariffs or take China to the WTO when attempts
to resolve disputes through dialogue fail.
 However, on one trade issue uppermost in the mind of many
lawmakers, Kirk declined to say whether he thought it was
possible to challenge China's currency practices at the WTO.
 ""It is a matter we're studying,"" he said.
 Many lawmakers believe China deliberately undervalues its
currency to give Chinese companies an unfair trade advantage.

 NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the U.S.

 The dollar fell to multi-month lows against the Japanese

 The U.S. Commerce Department said GDP expanded at a 2.4
percent annual rate in the second quarter, less than the 2.5
percent pace analysts polled by Reuters said they expected.
 Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic were down at one point
by 1 percent after the release of the GDP data, but a jump in
the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index suggested a slow but
steady economic recovery was spurring buying.
 The business barometer rose to 62.3 in July, higher than a
forecast of 56.5. Yet in a separate report, consumer sentiment
slumped to an 8-month low, emblematic of a fragile economy.
 Some analysts remained upbeat.
 ""The market had second thoughts on the data we had,"" said
Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of research at Brewin
Dolphin Securities in London. ""All the news is not in the

 Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon

the crude oil price situation,"" Medvedev said.
 The price for oil has recovered to $77 a barrel on Friday in
the United States, the world's largest market for the fuel,
after reaching a low of under $65 a barrel in May.
 Gazprom's total revenue is are predicted to rise to $124.4
billion in 2011 from an estimated $113.1 billion this year,
according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.
 StarMine gives more weight to more recent analyst estimates
and to analysts who were more accurate in the past than their
peers.
 Medvedev said in January gas demand in Europe, Gazprom's
main market outside Russia, would return to pre-crisis levels
around 2012/2013, which is close to the estimates of analysts,
who expect power demand to have recovered by the middle of the
decade.
 
 CHINA DEAL PROGRESSING
 As Gazprom, majority-owned by the Russian state, seeks to
find new customers for its gas, negotiations with energy-hungry
China are progressing.
 The Moscow-based company expects to deliver gas to China
from 2015 and it assumes the parameters of the contract --
except for the price -- with the China National Petroleum
Company will be sealed in September, Medvedev said.
 The two parties will probably agree on the price in the
middle of next year, the deputy chief reiterated.
 The ""price should justify the investment on both Russian and
Chinese territory,"" he said, without being more specific on
whether the priced should reflect current market prices for the
fuel.
 Natural gas in the United States for the next month traded
at $4.86 per million Britsh Therman units (BTU) on Friday.
 The demand for natural gas is rising because the fuel when
burned emits less carbon dioxide the coal, which reduces the
charges companies incur for emissions.
 Asked whether Gazprom might seek to acquire any of the
assets British oil producer BP Plc is planning to sell, Medvedev
said it was an option.
 ""We are in regular contact with BP management and rather
sure that if BP will be interested to sell part of the assets,
we will consider. But as per today we didn't get any proposal
from BP to look at any part of their portfolio,"" he said.
 BP has launched a $25 billion to $30 billion asset sales
program to pay damages caused by the massive oil spill it caused
in the Gulf of Mexico.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 12:20PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Key Euribor rate drops for first time since April," * Key Euribor rates rise for first time since April
 * Traders see recent improvements in money markets
 
 By Marc Jones
 (Adds trader quotes, background, detail)
 FRANKFURT, July 30 (Reuters) - Key euro interbank lending
rates fell for the first time since mid-April on Friday after
banks increased their uptake of cash from the European Central
Bank, signifying that the recent uptrend in money market rates
is likely to capped by unrestricted ECB liquidity.
 The three-month Euribor rate -- traditionally the main gauge
of interbank euro lending and a mix of interest rate
expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- fell to 0.896
percent from 0.899 percent the previous day, the first fall
since April 19.
 One-year rates fell to 1.417 percent from 1.419 percent,
shorter-term one-week rates dropped to 0.577 percent from 0.584
percent, while six-month rates remained at 1.145 percent.
 Interbank rates have been on an upward path since the end of
March, when a combination of the euro zone debt crisis and a
nearing 442 billion euros payback of ECB one-year loans, brought
an end to a 1-1/2 year decline which saw 3-month rates go as low
as 0.634 percent.
 The rise had been sustained on the belief that the ECB will
continue to scale back its lending support, and as banks have
reduced their consumption of ECB loans, although they increased
their uptake again this week.
 The crunch point should come at the ECB's September 2 policy
meeting when it is expected to decide whether to keep uncapped
loans available beyond mid-October for shorter-term one week
money and the end of September for three-month money.
 
 STRESS RELIEF
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet expressed little concern
about the recent rise in Euribor rates earlier this month, and
other ECB members have said it is part of the post-crisis
normalisation process.
 One trader at a large European bank said on Friday that
there had been ""quite a big improvement"" in money markets in the
last week since the publication of European bank stress tests,
adding that asset managers and pension funds had started
offering funds again.
 ""The 6-month to 1-years (markets) have been dead but this
week we are seeing quite a lot of sixes and nines. Also banks
that were having to pay up by 15 basis previously aren't having
to do so anymore,"" they added, on the condition of anonymity.
 However, another money market expert said that while there
had been a clear improvement, weaker banks were still struggling
to get funds longer dated than one month.
 He also noted that the ECB's uncapped funding injections
would continue to have a major influence on market rates.
 ""There will be a point where the equilibrium is reached. The
more market rates rise, the more attractive ECB funding becomes.
That increases the amount of excess liquidity in the market
which pushes down interbank rates.""

the European Union (FBE) shortly after 0900 GMT.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - The dollar hit multi-month
lows against the Japanese yen on Friday as data showed growth
in the world's largest economy is slowing and reinforced the
view U.S. interest rates will remain low well into the next
year.
 Dollar bears sold the U.S. currency versus the yen after
the government said in its first estimate that second-quarter
U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 2.4 percent annual
rate, after an upwardly revised 3.7 percent pace in the
January-March quarter. For details, see [ID:nN29111411]
 Analysts said Friday's report follows a string of recent
weak data from the United States that has weighed broadly on
the dollar. They added that the data may also hurt demand for
perceived riskier assets, favoring investments in currencies
such as the yen and the Swiss franc.
 ""It's going to be very difficult for a (dollar) rally and
people are going to get more risk averse. You could see euro go
below $1.30 and the dollar fall below 86 yen,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT Forex in New York.
 The GDP report ""is not helpful to the risk trade or the
dollar-yen, since we're seeing across all U.S. data releases
signs that the U.S. economy really is stuck in the mud,"" he
added.
 In late morning trade in New York, the dollar was down 0.2
percent at 86.60 yen  after hitting an eight-month low of
85.95 yen on the GDP report, according to Reuters.
 Stop-loss sales were triggered earlier at a previous low of
86.25 yen, traders said.
 The dollar pared some of its losses against the yen as
stocks rebounded after another report showed a jump in business
activity in the U.S. Midwest in July, offsetting some of the
negative sentiment over the GDP figures. [ID:nN30265688]
 The selling started on Thursday when Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis President James Bullard said the U.S. economy is
at risk of falling into a Japan-style deflationary trap and
that the best way for the Federal Reserve to avoid it would be
by buying more Treasuries. [ID:nN29267085]
 ""We're in a small window where U.S. economic data is
underperforming and keeping pressure on the dollar,"" said Lee
Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. 
 ""Concerns about the U.S. economy and Fed easing will also
put U.S. yields on the downside, which is a key driver for
dollar/yen,"" he said.
 RISING YEN
 The yen took in its stride comments by Japanese Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda that he was closely watching the
market. Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda said he was
worried about the impact of a rising yen on Japan's exports.
[ID:nTFD006497] [ID:nTFD006498]
 But traders and analysts said said they do not expect
Japanese authorities to intervene to stem the yen's rise until
it goes beyond 84.81 yen to the dollar, hit in November 2009,
according to Reuters data. That was a 14-1/2 year high for the
yen.
 The dollar also fell to a six-month low against the Swiss
franc at 1.0364 francs  but it was last little changed.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent versus the yen  to
113.04 yen and 0.3 percent versus the dollar to $1.3040 .
 Traders said the euro's fall against the yen was related to
redemption flows from Spanish bonds [ID:nLDE66M1PR].
 The euro's recovery to an 11-week high versus the dollar
earlier in the week was partly driven by rising euro zone money
market rates, which fell on Friday [ID:nEAP000492].

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 11:20AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Greece rejects EU request to sell PPC power plants," * EU request to sell PPC capacity problematic- official
 * EU, IMF willing to discuss alternatives, Greece says

(Adds analyst comment, unionists, background)
 By Harry Papachristou
 ATHENS, July 30 (Reuters) - Greece disagrees with a European
Union proposal to sell state utility PPC power plants to boost
competition in the country's energy sector, a senior government
official said on Friday.
 ""We do not agree with this proposal because it presents
serious legal and technical problems,"" Energy and Environment
Ministry general secretary Constantine Mathioudakis told
Reuters.
 Earlier this week, the European Commission told Greece to
sell 40 percent of PPC's lignite and hydro capacity to investors
as part of a bailout plan from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) that requires opening up the
country's economy.
 Mathioudakis said this was a proposal, not a demand, and
international officials were open to discussing alternatives.
 ""They have said that other, equivalent, measures could also
be implemented,"" he said.
 PPC currently controls 97 percent of the retail and 93
percent of the wholesale market for electricity in Greece.
 The country's socialist government has so far refused to
consider selling PPC assets for fear of upsetting the company's
powerful labour unions.
 
 NOT AFRAID OF JAIL
 PPC's labour union GENOP reiterated on Friday its threat of
strikes that would cut power to prevent any sale of PPC assets.
 ""We're not afraid to go to jail if we have to,"" the union
said in a statement.
 Christos Papoutsis, the socialist party's leader in
parliament, on Wednesday attacked the EU, saying it could not
ram through changes to PPC's ownership.
 Greek government officials have suggested that reform of the
wholesale electricity market would suffice to boost competition
in the sector.
 ""It seems like we will enter a period of negotiations
between the two sides on how the sector should be liberalised,""
said Vassilis Roumantzis, an analyst with IBG.
 On Thursday, Greek energy regulator RAE proposed a narrowing
of PPC's profit margin to make investments more profitable for
PPC's upstart rivals, such as Greek group Mytilineos and Italy's
Edison.
 But EU officials have described such measures as
""half-hearted fixes"", a Greek energy official who held talks
with them in Athens told Reuters earlier this week.
 Power cuts would be a further blow to the government,
already struggling with a crippling strike by truckers, who are
protesting an EU/IMF mandated liberalisation of their sector.
 PPC shares ended the session down 3.5 percent to 12.21 euros
($15.93) in Athens.
 ""The outlook for the company is very cloudy and this weighs
on the stock,"" Roumantzis said.

(Adds closing prices)
 By Selcuk Gokoluk
 ANKARA, July 30 (Reuters) - Turkish stocks closed lower on
Friday hit by sales of bank stocks after the publishing of
earnings by some sector players, and booking profits on three
consecutive days of gains.
 The main stock exchange index fell 1.43 percent to 59,866.75
points, but is still up by around 9 percent this month. The MSCI
global equities index dropped 0.85 percent.
 Banking stocks fell 2.56 percent, with state-run Halkbank
down 3.17 percent after it posted a forecast-beating
second-quarter net profit of 519.8 million lira ($344.2 million)
on Thursday.
 ""(Investors) are especially selling bank stocks and pulling
down the index. The index may fall to 59,000-59,500 levels,""
said a fund manager with one Turkish institution.
 Analysts, however, said the market remains on a positive
trend and has largely ignored escalating political tensions
ahead of a Sept. 12 referendum on a constitutional reform
package.
 The lira ended at 1.5090, almost unchanged from the previous
day's 1.51 against the dollar. The benchmark April 25, 2012
benchmark bond climbed to 8.32 percent from the previous day's
8.25 percent.
 Foreign bank reports suggested betting on rising yields and
players said Thursday's central bank move to raise reserve
requirements for foreign exchange deposits by 0.5 percentage
points also lifted bond yields.
 ""The benchmark April 25 2012 bond had fallen as low as 8.15
percent after starting trading 8.50 percent. Now it is back to
8.30 percent and this can be seen as booking profits,"" said the
same fund manager.
 Citi economists said in a note that the central bank's move
hints that the bank was becoming increasingly uncomfortable
about the appreciation of the lira and the rapid widening of the
trade deficit, which perked up 95 percent in the first half.
 Official data showed on Thursday that trade deficit moved 35
percent up in June to $5.62 billion.
 ""We believe that the rising pressures to contain the
appreciation of the lira will eventually lead the bank to raise
the size of its daily forex purchase auctions (currently up to
$60 million of which $30 million is optional),"" Citi said.
Thursday's March 2021 Eurobond tap bolstered sentiment in
the bond market.
 The Turkish Treasury sold $1 billion worth of March 2021
Eurobonds on Thursday in a tap that was five times
oversubscribed and exceeded its 2010 target for Eurobond
borrowing.
 ""Once again the Turkish Treasury got this deal away with
impeccable timing - this time almost to the hour, given the
broader global market weakening later yesterday,"" the Royal Bank
of Scotland analyst Timothy Ash said in a note.
 The Treasury said Eurobond issues in 2010 reached a total of
$6 billion with Thursday's tap.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 10:32AM ET</span>","GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Sorry, I am not in the office"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Send an e-mail to a fund manager
at the moment and the chances are high you will get a bounced
reply telling you that he/she is out of the office.
 The week ahead marks the start of August, a period that can
be -- but is by no means always -- one of reduced investing and
low tolerance for anything other than major market-moving
events.
 So although the week promises important earnings reports
from key European banks, a couple of key central bank meetings
and one of the biggest U.S. economic data releases -- jobs --
trading on financial markets may be limited.
 In fact, some big investors have already effectively closed
up for the holidays.
 State Street, the giant U.S. financial services firm that
watches over some $19 trillion in institutional investor assets,
says that activity among its clients in late July has been way
below average.
 ""Current volumes do seem unusually low. Both FX and equity
transactions by institutional investors are in the bottom fifth
of their past history,"" the firm said in response to a Reuters
request for data.
 Such dips in buying and selling activity can cause
volatility on markets because fewer buyers and sellers can mean
exaggerated price moves.
 That said, there is no guarantee that volume will be light.
State Street, for example, said that it generally finds little
seasonality in the patterns of institutional investment flows.
 Historical numbers from Thomson Reuters Datastream,
meanwhile, paint a mixed picture.
 Over the past four years, from 2006-2009, volume on the FTSE
100 index and Germany's DAX has been higher in August than July
on two occasions and lower on two.
 
 BANKING ON IT
 So while it may be that a lot of market people are taking a
break, asset prices can easily become volatile if there is
something significant enough to move them in a quiet period.
 In the coming week, that could be European banks, many of
which are due to report earnings.
 Since the generally positive stress test results were
released last Friday, Europe's financial sector stocks have
risen around 5 percent. Indeed, they are up 22 percent since
hitting a 2010 low on June 8.
 A lot of this is because investors reckoned the sector was
oversold after the Greek debt crisis. Both ING Investment
Management and AXA Investment Managers, for example, have
recently lifted their exposure to European banks.
 ""They were too cheap compared with what we expect they need
to write off (after the crisis),"" said Franz Wenzel, AXA senior
strategist in Paris.
 The next test for this sector will be the results.
 They are due from HSBC, Standard Chartered, BNP Paribas,
Barclays, Societe Generale, Commerzbank, Lloyds Banking Group
and RBS.
 U.S. banks have mostly reported already, and generally on
the positive side. According to Thomson Reuters Proprietary
Research, reported and remaining estimated quarterly earnings
for the financial sector have risen 35.9 percent.
 It compares with an expectation of 21 percent at the
beginning of July. Some 71 percent of results in the sector have
been better than expected.
 
 SLOWLY DOES IT
 Bond prices, in the meantime, are reflecting a climate of
low interest rates, generally manageable inflation expectations
and worries about the slowing U.S. economy.
 Yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries fell to a record low on
Friday after weak U.S. growth data and are less than 0.6
percent. The euro zone and UK equivalents are around 0.8
percent.
 Such low yields pose two threats to bond investors -- one,
that they are highly vulnerable to changes in the financial
environment and, two, that investors will be keen to jump ship
to something higher yielding as soon as they feel it safe.
 Reuters asset allocation polls for July already show
investors favouring investment grade corporate debt.
 The commitment to low-yielding government bonds will be
tested in the coming week by meetings of the European Central
Bank and the Bank of England.
 Investors in particular will be looking for guidance from
the ECB about how comfortable it is with the pace at which
European banks are weaning themselves off extraordinary
liquidity measures.
 Finally, the U.S. jobs data caps the week, giving a snapshot
on the impact an apparently slowing U.S. economy is having on
already lagging employment patterns.
 It is usually a big market mover and will quite likely be
again, even if a lot of people get the result on the beach.

 * Forecast of heavy rains may lead to floods in some parts
 * Water level in reservoirs rise on good rains in past
week
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Ratnajyoti Dutta
 NEW DELHI, July 30 (Reuters) - India's crucial monsoon
rains are likely to be above normal in the remaining two months
of the June-September season, the weather office said on
Friday, boosting prospects of strong harvests of rice, cane and
oilseeds.
 The La Nina weather phenomenon, which increases
precipitation in south Asia, will boost rainfall in August and
September, the India Meteorological Department said in a
statement.
 Rainfall in next two months is likely to be 107 percent of
normal, it said.
 ""The latest model forecasts from a majority of the
dynamical and statistical models indicate very high probability
(about 80 percent) for the La Nina conditions to continue
during the remaining part of the monsoon season,"" it said.
 The director general of the weather office, Ajit Tyagi,
said this year, the monsoon may withdraw later than the normal
date of Sept. 15, while floods in some regions cannot be ruled
out. ""There may be floods in some areas with this kind of a
forecast for the second half. But if rains are absolutely well
distributed, we may not see floods at all,"" Tyagi said.
 A normal monsoon, after last year's driest season in nearly
four decades, will help Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's
government to tame widely watched headline inflation, which
surged to 10.55 percent in June, holding in double digits for
the fifth straight month.
 ""This is a good forecast. It will be good for agriculture
and help ease pressure on prices,"" said Veeresh Hiremath, a
senior analyst with Hyderabad-based brokerage Karvy Comtrade.
 India's monsoon surged in the past week to deliver its
highest weekly rainfall this season, raising hopes of strong
harvests in the world's leading consumer of rice, cooking oils
and sugar.
 Heavy rains in the past week rapidly raised the water level
in Indian reservoirs to 27 percent of capacity, up 8 percentage
points in the past week, or twice the normal rate, government
data showed.
 The water level in the week to July 29, was still lower
than the average level of 33 percent of capacity at this time
of the year as the June-September monsoon was patchy and 16
percent below average until July 19.
 More water in reservoirs will boost the supply of
hydropower, which accounts for a quarter of India's total
generation capacity, and help irrigate crops even after the
monsoon season.

 NEW YORK, July 30 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell and the
U.S. dollar extended losses against the Japanese yen on Friday
as investors sought safety after a report showed the U.S.
economy slowed a bit more than expected in the second quarter.
 Government debt on both sides of the Atlantic rose after
the U.S. Commerce Department said gross domestic product
expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate, less than the 2.5
percent pace analysts polled by Reuters said they expected.
 U.S. Treasuries, German Bund futures and UK gilt futures
extended gains while European stocks slipped and oil fell below
$77 a barrel, extending an earlier drop, on news of the data.
 The slowdown in the U.S. recovery had been flagged in
recent weeks by a stream of weak economic data, adding to fears
of those we see the economy slipping back into recession -- the
much talked about double dip.
 ""Oil is coming down further after the data was published,
probably on the fear out there of a double-dip,"" said Daniel
Briesemann, analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 U.S. September crude  shed $1.42 to $76.94 a barrel.
ICE Brent  fell $1.25 to $76.34.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI's all-country world index

 Bond yields rose while their price, which moves inversely,
fell.
 The 30-year Treasury bond  was up 1-4/32, its
yield easing to 4.01 percent from 4.08 percent on Thursday.
 September Bund futures  climbed to 128.53, up 47

 September gilt futures  extended gains by around 10

 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> extended losses,
falling almost 1 percent to 1,036.57 points.
 Even though U.S. economic growth slowed, capital investment
driven by business spending boosted imports to their fastest
pace since the first quarter of 1984, a possible silver lining.
But the number was not encouraging.
 ""This is going to reinforce the sense people have that yes
companies have cut costs, yes that has helped earnings, but the
revenue line at some point has to get better and these GDP
numbers are not moving in that direction,"" Subodh Kumar, chief

 The markets may test the July lows, but probably not go
below that, Kumar said.
 The dollar extended losses against the yen to hit a session
low beneath 86 yen, and the greenback pared gains versus the
euro.
 The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 86.31 yen , after

 Stop-loss sales were triggered earlier at a previous low of
86.25 yen, traders said.
 The yen also took in its stride comments by Japanese
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda who said he was closely
watching the market. Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda
said he was worried about the impact of a rising yen on Japan's
exports.
 But traders and analyst said said they do not seriously
expect Japanese authorities to intervene to stem the yen's rise
until it goes beyond 84.81 yen to the dollar hit in November
2009, according to Reuters data. That was a 14 1/2 year high
for the yen.
 The dollar also fell to a six-month low against the Swiss
franc earlier of 1.0364 francs. That also prompted the Swiss
currency to rise against the euro.
 The euro fell 1.2 percent versus the yen to 112.10 yen and
0.6 percent versus the dollar to $1.3003.
 Traders said the euro's fall against the yen was related to
redemption flows from Spanish bonds.
 The euro's recovery to an 11-week high versus the dollar
earlier in the week had been partly driven by rising euro zone
money market rates, which fell on Friday.

 * To offer 800 shares on Chi-X Japan platform by Sept
 * Aims to bring in more liquidity, more foreign investors
 
 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, July 30 (Reuters) - Chi-X, a new breed of trading
system that has grabbed nearly a fifth of share volume in Europe
with faster and cheaper trades, aims for 10 percent of the Japan
market in three to four years, a top executive told Reuters.
 Chi-X Japan, a unit of Nomura Holdings, launched its system
in Japan on Thursday with trading available in five actively
traded stocks, including Toyota Motor and Sony Corp.
 It plans to expand to all 225 constituents of the benchmark
Nikkei average next week and increase to 800 stocks by
September, representing about 95 percent of the market value of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main board.
 ""Over three to four years if we can achieve 5-10 percent of
the market that would be a success in our minds,"" Joseph Meyer,
chief executive of Chi-X Japan, said in an interview on Friday.
 ""However, our real goal and measure of success is whether
our arrival in the Japan markets prompts new liquidity providers
to trade in Japan who have not traded in this market before.""
 Alternative trading venues are not new in Japan. A handful
of companies have launched so-called proprietary trading systems
(PTS) with the aim of grabbing business from the TSE by offering
investors speedier transactions at lower cost.
 PTS account for only 1 percent of volume, against the TSE's
dominant share above 90 percent. Among the biggest are those run
by financial services conglomerate SBI Holdings and online
broker kabu.com Securities Co.
 Chi-X in London accounts for around 26-27 percent of overall
trade on the London Stock Exchange and it has a market share of
about 17 percent in Europe.
 The growth of PTS in Japan has been slow. Japanese
participants are still conservative about using the new platform
and tend to stick to conventional exchanges.
 Chi-X aims to bring more liquidity to the Japanese market
and invite more foreign investors.
 ""The start of Chi-X in Japan along with the changes in TSE
allows Japan for the first time to draw in new liquidity from
overseas, the liquidity that has not been present here before,""
said Ronald Gould, chief executive of Chi-X Asia-Pacific, who
was also present at the interview.
 Gould was referring to the TSE's $140 million new trading
platform, called Arrowhead, which was launched in January.
 The TSE introduced Arrowhead to attract more business from
hedge funds and other professional investors who increasingly
rely on sophisticated automated trading strategies.
 The TSE's Arrowhead processes trades in 2-3 milliseconds
compared with the previous one which took up to 3 seconds, while
Chi-X is about four times faster than Arrowhead.

 In Asian trade, the dollar's fall was primarily driven by

 LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to an
eight-month low against the yen on Friday while global shares
slipped on worries U.S. growth data due later in the day may
show the world's biggest economy is losing steam.
 The retreat in stocks and other riskier assets fed a rally

adding to fears about the economy.
 The second quarter GDP data, due at 1230 GMT, will be
particularly closely watched after a stream of economic data in

from the worst downturn since the 1930s.

 JAPAN STYLE QUAGMIRE?
 Economists forecast U.S. growth to have slowed to 2.5
percent in the three months to June from 2.7 percent in the
first quarter. But worries persist it could come in weaker.
 St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, a
voting member on the Fed's rate-setting committee this year,
said he was worried about the risks the United States might fall
into a Japan-style quagmire of falling prices and investment.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were 0.4 percent down as
European shares retreated for a third consecutive session.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index shed 0.3 percent but
was still on track to record its best monthly gain since March,
helped by upbeat corporate earnings.
 ""What I see in this market is a fight between macro-economic
data and better-than-expected company results,"" said Koen De
Leus, economist at KBC Securities. ""It appears the U.S. Federal
Reserve is preparing the markets for worst-than-expected data.""
 Japan's Nikkei closed down 1.6 percent as signs that the
U.S. recovery was faltering outweighed upbeat domestic earnings.
 Sluggish jobs growth, marked by a 9.5 percent unemployment
rate, is the biggest obstacle to the U.S. economy's recovery
from the most brutal recession since the 1930s.
 In Britain, consumer confidence fell for the fifth month in
a row in July to its lowest in almost a year, further cooling
deemed for riskier assets.
 ""This type of news flow will continue to depress
expectations over the pace of economic recovery,"" said Gerard
Lane, analyst at Shore Capital.
 U.S. crude prices retreated, heading for a fourth
consecutive weekly settlement within the $75-$80 range, with
investor focus on a slowing economy and rising U.S. inventories.

 LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to an
eight-month low against the yen on Friday on concerns that GDP
data would add to signs of fading momentum for the U.S. economic
recovery and on a Fed policymaker's dovish comments.
 Dollar bears are looking to U.S. second-quarter GDP due at

growth forecast to slow to an annual 2.5 percent in the three

 St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, seen
as one of the more hawkish members, said the risk of deflation
in the United States has risen somewhat compared with the
beginning of this year, and the Fed would need to act if the
economy worsened significantly.
 At 0718 GMT, the dollar was down 0.3 percent at 86.48 yen,
after hitting an eight-month low of 86.25 yen on trading
platform EBS. Stop-loss sales were seen below that level, while
option barriers were cited at 86.00 yen, traders said.

 In Asian trade, the dollar's fall was primarily driven by
month-end selling from Japanese exporters, which overwhelmed
buying from several Japanese investment funds launched Friday.
 ""We saw some month-end flows, in both directions, which
dictated price moves today. But when the dust settles, the
market will focus on economic fundamentals,"" said Hideaki Inoue,
manager of forex at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking.
 The yen took in its stride comments by Japanese Finance

worried about the impact of a rising yen on Japan's exports.
 Market players have said they do not seriously expect

it goes beyond 15-year highs of 84.82 yen to the dollar.
 The dollar index stood at 81.517, near a three-month low of
81.488 hit on Thursday.

 EURO STEADY
 The euro held steady at $1.3077, not far from a 12-week high
of $1.3107 hit on Thursday, when data showed a jump in euro zone
economic sentiment to a 28-month high and a decline in German
unemployment.
 Key technical resistance stood around $1.3120/25, which was
the 38.2 percent retracement of the December 2009 high at
$1.5141 to the June low of $1.1876, traders said. Previous
resistance of $1.3050 was providing support.
 A raft of surprisingly upbeat economic data from Germany and
receding sovereign credit risk concerns have buoyed the euro.
 That stood in contrast to the United States, which saw data
undershoot market expectations.
 The yen was also underpinned by speculation about the
potential for fund repatriation flows into the yen related to
redemptions of Spanish bonds.
 There was some market talk that Japanese retail margin
traders were buying back the yen, or may do so, on Friday ahead
of the implementation of a new leverage cap starting on Aug. 1,
when maximum leverage will be capped at 50 times collateral.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 03:36AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-China overtakes Japan as No.2 economy - FX chief," * China set to grow by more than 9 pct this year
 * No basis for sharp yuan rise; rate nearer to equilibrium
 * China to keep mix of FX reserve assets
 * Beijing in no rush to make yuan a global currency;
 By Aileen Wang and Alan Wheatley
 BEIJING, July 30 (Reuters) - China has overtaken Japan to
become the world's second-largest economy, the fruit of three
decades of rapid growth that has lifted hundreds of millions of
people out of poverty.
 Depending on how fast its exchange rate rises, China is on
course to overtake the United States and vault into the No.1
spot sometime around 2025, according to projections by the
World Bank, Goldman Sachs and others.
 China came close to surpassing Japan in 2009 and the
disclosure by a senior official that it had now done so comes
as no surprise. Indeed, Yi Gang, China's chief currency
regulator, mentioned the milestone in passing in remarks
published on Friday.
 ""China, in fact, is now already the world's second-largest
economy,"" he said in an interview with China Reform magazine
posted on the website (www.safe.gov.cn) of his agency, the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
 Cruising past Japan might give China bragging rights, but
its per-capita income of about $3,800 a year is a fraction of
Japan's or America's.
 ""China is still a developing country, and we should be wise
enough to know ourselves,"" Yi said, when asked whether the time
was ripe for the yuan to become an international currency.
 CAN IT BE SUSTAINED?
 China's economy expanded 11.1 percent in the first half of
2010, from a year earlier, and is likely to log growth of more
than 9 percent for the whole year, according to Yi.
 China has averaged more than 9.5 percent growth annually
since it embarked on market reforms in 1978. But that pace was
bound to slow over time as a matter of arithmetic, Yi said.
 If China could chalk up growth this decade of 7-8 percent
annually, that would still be a strong performance. The issue
was whether the pace could be sustained, Yi said, not least
because of the environmental constraints China faces.
 In an assessment disputed by Beijing, the International
Energy Agency said last week that China had surpassed the
United States as the world's largest energy user.
 If China can keep up a clip of 5-6 percent a year in the
2020s, it will have maintained rapid growth for 50 years, which
Yi said would be unprecedented in human history.
 The uninterrupted economic ascent, which saw China overtake
Britain and France in 2005 and then Germany in 2007, is
gradually translating into clout on the world stage.
 China is a leading member of the Group of 20 rich and
emerging nations, which since the 2008 financial crisis has
become the world's premier economic policy-setting forum.
 In one important respect, however, China is still a
shrinking violet: anxious to shield itself from the
rough-and-tumble of global markets, it does not permit its
currency to be freely exchanged except for purposes of trade
and foreign direct investment.
 And Yi said Beijing had no timetable to make the yuan fully
convertible.
 ""China is very big and its development is unbalanced, which
makes this problem much more complicated. It's difficult to
reach a consensus on it,"" he said.
 In the same vein, China was in no rush to turn the yuan
into a global currency.
 ""We must be modest and we still have to keep a low profile.
If other people choose the yuan as a reserve currency, we won't
stop that as it is the demand of the market. However, we will
not push hard to promote it,"" he added.
 NO BIG RISE IN YUAN
 China has been encouraging the use of the yuan beyond its
borders, allowing more trade to be settled in renminbi and
taking a series of measures to establish Hong Kong as an
offshore centre where the currency can circulate freely.
 But Yi said: ""Don't think that since people are talking
about it, the yuan is close to becoming a reserve currency.
Actually, it's still far from that.""
 He said expectations of a stronger yuan also known as the
renminbi, had diminished. There was no basis for a sharp rise
in the exchange rate, partly because the price level in China
had risen steadily over the past decade.
 ""This suggests that the value of the renminbi has moved
much closer to equilibrium compared with 10 years ago,"" he
said.
 Yi's comments are unlikely to go down well in Washington,
where lawmakers have scheduled a hearing for Sept. 16 to
consider whether U.S. government action is needed to address
China's exchange rate policy.
 China scrapped the yuan's 23-month-old peg to the dollar on
June 19 and resumed a managed float. The yuan has since risen
only 0.8 percent against the dollar, and economists calculate
that it has fallen in value against a basket of currencies.
 China would stick to the principle of holding its $2.45
trillion of official reserves in a mix of currencies and
assets.
 The stockpile -- the world's largest - was so big that it
was impossible to adjust its currency composition in a short
space of time: ""We won't be particularly bearish on the dollar
at a given time or particularly bearish on the euro at another
time.""

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 02:24AM ET</span>",CORRECTED - CORRECTED-Honda Q1 jumps on stronger sales; raises forecast," (Corrects headline to ... raises forecast ... not, keeps
forecast)
 TOKYO, July 30 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co posted a nine-fold
surge in quarterly operating profit on Friday on brisk sales in
the United States, China, and other Asian markets, and it
raised its forecasts despite a sharp rise in the yen.
 Japan's No. 2 automaker reported an operating profit of 234.4
billion yen ($2.7 billion) for the April-June quarter, up from
25.2 billion yen a year ago and beating the average 138.3 billion
yen estimated by six analysts surveyed by Reuters.
 First-quarter net profit, which includes earnings made in
China, was 272.5 billion yen, up from 7.6 billion yen a year
earlier.
 Honda's car sales, while higher, have lagged the broader U.S.
market because much of the recent rise in demand in the world's
second-largest auto market has been in the less profitable fleet
business where Honda is under-represented.
 For the year to March 31, 2011, Honda now expects an
operating profit of 450 billion yen, higher than its previous
forecast of 400 billion yen. A survey of 19 analysts by Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S forecasts profit of 484 billion yen.
 The maker of the Accord and Civic cars lifted its net profit
forecast to 455 billion yen from 340 billion yen.
 Shares of Honda have fallen 13 percent in the year to date,
slightly better than Tokyo's transport sector subindex, which
lost 14 percent in the same period.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2010 12:48AM ET</span>",Fund flows reflect underlying concerns on outlook-EPFR," * Emerging market equity fund inflows at 16-week high
 * Commodity sector funds see $1 bln in outflow
 * Defensive sectors such as utilities see inflows
 HONG KONG, July 30 (Reuters) - Emerging market equities,
especially in Asia, were hot among fund investors in the last
week, but a sell-off in commodity stock funds and flows into
cash suggest concerns persist about the global economic
outlook.
 Investors sent $10 billion in aggregate to equity funds
globally in the week to July 28, with flows into emerging
markets mandates hitting a 16-week high. Bond funds absorbed
$5.58 billion, EPFR Global said in a report on Friday.
 Emerging markets, which have been growing much faster than
advanced economies, are increasingly being seen as a more
fundamentally safe asset class. The 3-month change in 12-month
earnings forecasts for the U.S. S&P 500 slid to negative this
week for the first time in about a year.
 Expectations that policy rates in major economies will
remain low for a long time kept money flowing into bond funds.
 EMERGING MARKET EQUITY FUNDS
 Global emerging market funds and Asia ex-Japan funds
absorbed more than $1 billion during the week.
 Asia ex-Japan had the biggest inflow in 14 weeks. India
equity funds had their eighth-straight week of inflows and
China equity funds posted the best week of inflows since mid
April.
 Flows into Brazil Equity Funds climbed to a 27-week high of
$123 million.
 The other BRIC market, Russia, also fared well with
investors committing $103 million to Russia equity funds.
 DEVELOPED MARKET EQUITY FUNDS
 Global equity funds, Japan and Pacific fund groups all
posted outflows in the latest week.
 U.S. equity funds took in $7.3 billion, accounting for the
majority of inflows to equity funds globally.
 Europe equity funds had weekly inflows for only the sixth
time year to date, with regional and German equity funds
receiving the bulk of the inflows.
 SECTOR FUNDS
 Commodity sector funds suffered a large $1 billion in
outflows, reflecting increasingly more defensive positioning
among investors.
 Energy and financial sector funds also had outflows.
 Consumer goods, utilities and healthcare/biotechnology
sector Funds all took in more than $400 million during the
week, with the latter two fund groups recording their best
weeks since the fourth quarter 2009 and fourth quarter 2008,
respectively.
 BOND FUNDS
 All four major bond fund groups tracked by EPFR posted
inflows of more than $1 billion for the week.
 Global bond funds took in $1.53 billion, while emerging
market bond funds had their second best week of inflows so far
this year.
 Investors appeared to be moving further down the yield
curve with U.S. intermediate bond funds attracting more than
four times as much inflow as short-term bond funds. That is a
marked shift from flow patterns established this year.

 * Euro off 12-week high but supported by dollar weakness
 * Aussie down, Swiss franc up a tad as risk shunned
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 30 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to an eight-month
low against the yen on Friday, hurt by selling from Japanese
exporters and concerns that U.S. GDP data would add to signs of
fading momentum for the U.S. economic recovery.
 In Asian trade, the dollar's fall was primarily driven by
month-end selling from Japanese exporters, which overwhelmed
buying from several new Japanese investment funds launched on
Friday.
 ""At the start of this week, it looked like there would be an
end to the dollar/yen's downtrend but now it looks as if there
will be no change and it is set to end the month of July lower,""
said Kakuya Kojoh, the head of securities department at Nissan
Century Securities.
 ""The dollar will likely test 86 yen. It could even fall below
85 yen next week."" 
 Dollar bears are looking to U.S. second-quarter GDP due at
1230 GMT as a further opportunity to sell the currency, with
economists forecasting growth to slow to 2.5 percent in the three
months to June from 2.7 percent in the first quarter.
 The GDP data will be followed by U.S. manufacturing and job
figures next week.
 ""Today we saw some month-end flows, in both directions, which
dictated price moves today. But when the dust settles, the market
will focus on economic fundamentals,"" said Hideaki Inoue, manager
of forex at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking.
 The dollar slipped 0.6 percent versus the yen to an
eight-month low of 86.25 yen.
 The yen showed no response to an unexpected fall in Japanese
industrial production. The market also shrugged off the news that
a group of Japanese lawmakers called for the Bank of Japan to set
an inflation target of two to three percent.
 The dollar has been hobbled by worries over the U.S. economy,
after a raft of U.S. economic data in the past month undershot
market expectations.
 St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said
on Thursday he is worried about the risks that the United States
could fall into a Japan-style quagmire of falling prices and
investment.
 Although his comments had only a marginal impact on the
currency market, some traders were surprised by the candid tone.
 The dollar also remained not far from a 12-week low against
the euro, which benefited from a jump in euro-zone economic
sentiment to a 28-month high and a decline in German unemployment
on Thursday.
 The euro slipped 0.1 percent against the dollar in early
Asian trade to $1.3060, close to a 12-week high of $1.3107 marked
on Thursday.
 The next key resistance level for the single currency is seen
at $1.3125, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
peak-to-trough move from November 2009 to June.
 The dollar index stood at 81.62, just a hair above
three-month low of 81.488.
 The Australian dollar slipped 0.3 percent to $0.8993, as
Chinese and other Asian shares fell.
 But the safe-haven Swiss franc rose 0.1 percent, building on
the 1.5 percent gain it made on Thursday. The franc rose to as
high as 1.0388 franc per dollar, near a five-month peak of 1.0374
hit on Thursday.

 Fears that a 3 percent rise in the yuan would drive exporters

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2010 06:56PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-IMF bound by politics in Chinese yuan debate," By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - Substantially.
 That single word, left out of the International Monetary
Fund's assessment of China's undervalued currency, laid bare
the tricky IMF internal politics that govern even its most
routine interactions with the world's newest economic power.
 IMF staff, under pressure for years from member countries
to tell it like it is when assessing a country's economic
health, said China's yuan was ""substantially"" undervalued.
 But by the time the final assessment passed through the
IMF's 24-member board of shareholder countries on Monday, that
word had fallen victim to disagreements between those who put
faith in Beijing to let its currency rise more rapidly and
those among the Group of Seven rich nations who doubt much
progress would be made.
 The board statement simply called the yuan ""undervalued""
with several countries questioning the accuracy of IMF staff
projections of a major increase in China's current account
surplus over the next several years.
 On the one side are emerging market economies, like Brazil,
who stood behind China, and on the other the G7 old-line powers
who believe the yuan is still too cheap but did not say so.
 ""The G7 wants more flexibility in how the currency is
managed but at the same time they want to do that
diplomatically,"" said Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board
member now at Brookings Institution.
 Still, Lombardi said calling the yuan undervalued,
regardless of whether it is substantial or not, sent a strong
signal to Beijing that it needs to revalue the currency.
 ""It is clear the board adopted a diplomatic stance. They
tried to do their best not to upset the Chinese authorities but
in the end preserved the substance of the IMF staff's message
by concurring the exchange rate was undervalued,"" he added.
 SOFTER ONE FROM WASHINGTON
 The outcome reflects not only muscle-flexing on the part of
China but some softening of the U.S. position.
 The Obama administration has toned down some of the
rhetoric the previous Bush administration used when describing
the extent to which China's yuan is undervalued.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said repeatedly it
is ""China's choice"" to decide how and when to let market forces
play a larger role in determining the yuan's value, even as he
emphasized it was in China's interest to do so.
 As recently as Sunday, he praised Beijing's recent move to
free the yuan from a dollar peg and described that as a helpful
move toward easing global trade imbalances even though the yuan
has risen less than one percent since China did so.
 ""What matters to us is how fast and how far they let it
go,"" Geithner said, a gentle reminder that while Washington
likes Beijing's policy direction it is also monitoring its
effectiveness.
 In contrast, the Bush administration grew frustrated with
efforts to convince China to let its currency rise faster and
pressured the IMF unsuccessfully to label China a currency
manipulator.
 While the IMF never bowed to that pressure, it did change
its currency surveillance rules to say that member countries
should stay away from policies that result in ""external
instability,"" in addition to avoiding currency manipulation and
intervention.
 Beijing accused the IMF of not being even-handed and
stalled the IMF's process for reviewing its economy for two
years. Current IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has
overturned that rule, saying it made discussions with member
countries less open.
 DISAPPEARING FOOTNOTE
 In another twist, China -- supported by other emerging
market economies -- took umbrage with a footnote in the IMF
staff report stating that staff estimated the yuan was
undervalued by somewhere between 5 percent and 27 percent.
 The footnote was removed at China's behest before the staff
documents were published on Thursday.
 Such estimates are not unusual and fall under the IMF's
expertise. They have, however, always been a thorny issue
because of the broad disagreement among economists on how best
to determine whether currencies accurately reflect a country's
economic fundamentals.
 To be fair, all IMF member countries have a say in what is
published and what is not in reviews of their economies.
 ""The Chinese looked at the whole report to assess whether
it's a fair and balanced report and also if we had reflected
their views correctly in the report,"" IMF mission chief to
China Nigel Chalk told reporters on a conference call.
 Eswar Prasad, a former IMF official and trade professor at
Cornell University, said China's surprisingly quick agreement
to release the report reflected Beijing's growing confidence it
is control of the global debate over its currency.
 While the staff report had some tough language on the need
for further currency reforms, it also praised Beijing's recent
announcement to move to a more flexible exchange rate, even
though there has been little actual movement in the yuan.
 China was further emboldened by the board's at best
lukewarm support for the IMF staff's relatively hard-line position on the currency issue, said Prasad, a senior fellow

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on
Thursday as tech companies' weak outlooks fueled recovery
concerns, although the euro rose to a 12-week high against the
dollar on better-than-expected European economic data.
 Stocks erased initial gains, encouraging investors to buy
safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, as investors worried that an
expected economic slowdown will eventually hurt earnings.
 Weak outlooks from chipmaker Nvidia Corp  and
software maker Symantec Corp  added to those fears,
offsetting a batch of strong quarterly earnings from major
companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp , Rolls Royce Plc
 and BAE Systems Plc .
 ""There is still a lack of confidence in the sustainability
of economic growth and the sustainability of the earnings
stream being extended into 2011,"" said Heino Ruland,
strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt.
 Investors are particularly worried about Friday's report
on U.S. gross domestic product, which is expected to show the
economy lost steam in the second quarter.
 Also hurting sentiment were comments from St. Louis
Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, who said he is
worried about the risks the United States could fall into a
Japan-style quagmire of deflation and falling investment.
 ""Any time you make the comparison that the U.S. might look
like Japan, that has to be considered a negative,"" said
Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in
Westport, Connecticut.
 Global stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.05 percent. In Europe, the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top shares fell 0.38
percent to end at 1,046.90 points, having earlier risen to a
high of 1,060.96 points.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> lost 30.72 points,
or 0.29 percent, to end at 10,467.16, while the Standard &

 Shares of Nvidia Corp  plunged 9.87 percent to
$9.13. Symantec Corp  stocks sank 11.18 percent to
$13.03.
 The PHLX Semiconductor Index <.SOXX> fell 1.9 percent. It
remains up 6 percent for July.
 Despite Thursday's pullback, the Dow managed to stay in
positive territory for the year.
 With just one trading day left in July, the major U.S.
stock indexes were up about 7 percent for the month. At
Thursday's close, the Dow was up 7.09 percent for July, while
the S&P 500 was up 6.87 percent and the Nasdaq was up 6.75
percent.
 EURO BRIEFLY POPS ABOVE $1.31
 The euro climbed to a 12-week high against the dollar,
however, as month-end demand and supportive data helped push
the single currency above a key technical barrier.

a decline in German unemployment. [ID:nLDE66S0VN]

 The euro  rose 0.66 percent to $1.3078, its
strongest since May 4. Earlier, it briefly traded at $1.3106.
 The dollar also declined across the board after California
declared a state of emergency over its finances on Wednesday.
 The greenback was down against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
off 0.67 percent at 81.637.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.54
percent at 86.92.
 ""Economic resilience in Europe, particularly in Germany,

to fuel an unwinding of bets against the euro and push it
higher across the board,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market
analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, D.C.
 SOME T-NOTES AND COMMODITIES RISE
 Some U.S. Treasury debt prices turned higher as stocks
fell, offsetting the impact of a soft auction of seven-year
paper.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury note  gained 2/32 in
price, pushing its yield down to 2.9866 percent. The 2-year
note  was up 1/32, with the yield at 0.5855
percent.
 In the commodities markets, U.S. crude oil  rose
$1.37, or 1.78 percent, to settle at $78.36 per barrel,
boosted by the dollar's weakness.
 Spot gold prices  rose $3.38, or 0.29 percent, to
$1,166.40 an ounce.
 India, one of the world's largest gold consumers, bought
physical gold at attractive prices and kept gold off
Wednesday's three-month lows as the country stocked up on the
precious metal before festivals.
 Copper hit a three-month high as a weaker dollar and
copper inventories data revived buyers' interest. Benchmark
copper  on the London Metal Exchange closed at $7,231 a

* Euro trades above $1.31 for first time since early May
* Focus now on whether euro can climb above $1.3125
(Updates prices, adds details and comment)
 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - The euro rallied above
$1.3100 to a 12-week high against a broadly weaker dollar on
Thursday as supportive European data prompted investors to bet
the European economy is on a better track compared with the
United States.
 The euro's advance started early in the global session
after a jump in euro-zone economic sentiment to a 28-month
high and a decline in German unemployment.
 This contrasted with recent weak data from the United
States that has weighed broadly on the dollar. Investors are
mindful of figures on Friday expected to show slower second-
quarter growth in the world's largest economy.
 The lackluster U.S. data has reinforced the view benchmark
interest rates will remain at record lows in the United States
well into 2011, while euro-denominated assets still offer
higher returns to investors.
 Traders cited demand for euros from an Asian central bank
in early European trade and they also welcomed news that the
Italian government's 25-billion-euro ($32.54 billion) package
of austerity measures cleared a final hurdle. The package is
intended to shore up Italy's public finances.
 ""Economic resilience in Europe ... despite the formidable
sovereign credit headwinds, continues to fuel an unwinding of
bets against the euro and push it higher across the board,""
said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange, in Washington, D.C.
 But Esiner warned that while the euro is likely to enjoy
continued support over the near term, especially if U.S. data
remains weak, its gains may prove limited if concerns about a
slowing U.S. economy widen to include the broader global
economy.
 In late afternoon New York trade, the euro was up 0.7
percent at $1.3077. The single currency briefly traded at
$1.3106, its strongest since May 4.
 The euro has risen around 7 percent versus the dollar this
month.
 The next key resistance level for the single currency is
seen at $1.3125, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
peak-to-trough move from November 2009 to June.
 RESISTANCE GALORE
 CitiFX Technicals said there was a plethora of resistance
in the euro/dollar $1.3080 and $1.3115, whch has been pivotal
to varying degrees for the last 18 months.
 Further bolstering the euro were investors selling dollars
before the end of the month to hedge the currency exposure on
their holdings of U.S. assets, Citibank analysts said.
 Euro gains accelerated once the currency went over
$1.3050, a level in which automatic buy-orders were triggered,
forcing other investors to unwind bets against the euro to
prevent further losses, traders said, a practice known as
short covering.
 Citibank analysts said investors continued to buy U.S.
equities into the end of July as U.S. stock markets
outperformed other global equities.
 This suggests that ""investors, on balance. will be net
sellers of dollars to bring their hedges in line with the
increased value of their U.S. assets,"" they said, adding that
the signal to sell dollars was ""quite strong.""
 YEN, KIWI AND AUSSIE RISE
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent against the yen to 86.85 yen.
It traded in a range of bwteeen 87.51 and 86.58. Southern
Hemisphere currencies were active, with the New Zealand dollar
 gaining 0.4 percent to $0.7238. The kiwi recovered from
an earlier fall after the central bank raised interest rates
by a quarter point, as widely expected, but warned that
further hikes could be more gradual.
 The New Zealand dollar's recovery was aided by a rise in
the Australian dollar, which climbed 1.1 percent to $0.9006.
 Analysts warned, however, that the gains in the Australian
dollar may not last.
 William Reekstin, a director with Direct Access Partners,
a global markets group in New York, said local Australian
inflation concerns are probably overblown, and as that
realization increases, the prospect of higher interest rates
will fall, reducing the attractiveness of the aussie against
its U.S. counterpart.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2010 03:40PM ET</span>",US officials to go to China to push shunning Iran," WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - Senior U.S. officials said
on Thursday they will travel to China in August to push Beijing
to abide by international sanctions on Iran.
 Chinese companies have been pursuing trade with Iran
despite the threat of U.S. sanctions and a June United Nations
Security Council resolution imposing more punitive measures on
Tehran over its nuclear program, the officials told a House of
Representatives committee.
 ""China is of concern to us,"" said Robert Einhorn, special
adviser for nonproliferation and arms control at the State
Department.
 ""We need for them to enforce the Security Council
resolution,"" he said, noting China was a member of the council
that agreed new measures to press Iran, including action
against Iranian banks and shipping lines.
 China should not ""backfill"" by doing more deals with Iran
while ""responsible countries are distancing themselves from
Iran,"" Einhorn said.
 Joseph Christoff, head of the Government Accountability
Office's international affairs and trade department, told the
House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that
Chinese companies are aggressively investing in Iran's energy
sector despite the threat of sanctions.
 Einhorn said he and Dan Glaser, the Treasury Department's
deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing, would be
going to China in August.
 Glaser said they would travel to South Korea and Japan next
week as part of a plan to visit countries in Asia, the Middle
East and South America to urge governments and companies to cut
business ties with Iran.
 The aim is to get Iran to halt its nuclear work, which
Washington believes is aimed at making a bomb. Iran says the
work is aimed at generating electricity.
 Einhorn said the State Department was reviewing past
activity that could have triggered penalties under the U.S.
Iran sanctions law first passed in the mid-1990s.
 He said officials had identified fewer than 10 cases dating
from before President Barack Obama took office which appeared
""problematic"".
 Once companies are determined to be violators, the U.S. law
requires sanctions such as denial of Export-Import Bank
financing. But U.S. lawmakers have complained that no sanctions
were ever imposed under the law, which they have strengthened
to squeeze Iran's banks and fuel imports.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2010 02:48PM ET</span>",US trade chief Kirk to outline new enforcement push," * Kirk to discuss new enforcement initiative in Pittsburgh
 * Obama WTO case filings fall short of campaign rhetoric
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 29 (Reuters) - During the heat of the 2008
presidential campaign, Democrats vowed to make enforcement of
U.S. trade agreements a top priority if President Barack Obama
won the White House. Now, with Democrats' grasp on Congress
looking shaky, they are sounding the same note.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk will visit Pittsburgh on
Friday to give a speech on Obama's trade enforcement agenda.
 The spotlight on making sure other countries ""play by the
rules"" follows Obama's decision to push ahead with free trade
agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that many
Democratic voters in union-heavy states oppose.
 With many Americans generally frustrated and angry with
Washington, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll this week found 72
percent of Republicans certain that they will vote in November
compared to 49 percent of Democrats.
 Kirk's office said he would discuss ""a new step the Obama
administration will take on trade enforcement this year,"" but
has given few details. Kirk himself provided only a teaser at a
roundtable with reporters on Wednesday.
 ""Come to Pittsburgh and you'll get more,"" he said after one
reporter joked that all Kirk does is talk about ""negotiation,
negotiation"" instead of taking action, such as filing new cases
at the World Trade Organization.
 But in the same news conference, Kirk also made clear his
dislike for WTO litigation, which can take years to resolve and
often produce mixed results.
 ""My guiding principle is that where we can get issues
resolved through direct negotiations, no matter how difficult
they are, we're so much better served than saying 'I'm going to
go to the WTO and file a case',"" Kirk said.
 ""Because part of my concern was the number of matters we
have with trade partners that have been at the WTO five years,
10 years, 20 years. Because at that point, you've got a war of
wills between lawyers who are each concerned they're right.""
 In keeping with that philosophy, Kirk has filed just two
WTO cases -- one against excise taxes the Philippines imposes
on imported liquor and another in conjunction with the European
Union against China's export restraints on raw materials used
in the production of steel.
 TRADE RULES ENFORCEMENT
 U.S. trade officials argue enforcement is about more than
going to the WTO and that they have been aggressive on other
fronts, ranging from Obama's decision to slap tariffs on tires
from China to settling disputes with the European Union over
beef and with Israel over intellectual property rights.
 Still, Kirk's aversion to WTO litigation is at odds with
complaints Democrats made against former President George W.
Bush during his eight years in office.
 Lael Brainard, now U.S. Treasury under secretary for
international affairs, accused Bush in 2008 of lax enforcement
because the number of WTO cases brought by the United States
fell during his two terms to about three per year compared to
11 annually under Democrat Bill Clinton.
 Based on growth in world trade and the rise in the number
of WTO members, ""you would have expected 17 cases per year"" if
the Bush administration was serious about enforcement, said
Brainard, who served in the Clinton White House.
 Both Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly urged Kirk
to file a case against China's currency policy at the WTO, so
far to no avail. They argue China's yuan is so undervalued it
effectively ""frustrates"" trade liberalization commitments
Beijing made when it joined the world trade body.
 Senators pressed Kirk on the issue at his confirmation
hearing, and more than a year later his office has yet to give
a definitive answer on whether it thinks a case is possible.
 Many WTO experts, however, consider it a long shot and
think it would be risky for the United States to launch such a
challenge given vague WTO language on the issue.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2010 01:04PM ET</span>",EU governments seen opposing GM crop proposals," * Meeting reveals ""huge opposition"" to plans by EU states
 * GM crop plans criticised by EU food and farm industries
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, July 29 (Reuters) - European Union governments
have signalled their strong opposition to proposals allowing
member states to decide whether to grow or ban genetically
modified (GM) crops, a Belgian EU presidency source said on
Thursday.
 The bloc's executive, the European Commission, tabled
proposals earlier this month giving governments the freedom to
choose whether or not to grow GM crops. To pass, the plans must
first be approved by EU governments and lawmakers.
 The move was seen as an attempt by the Commission to break a
longstanding deadlock in EU GM approvals, which has seen just
two products authorised for cultivation in Europe, restricting
commercial plantings to less than 100,000 hectares.
 Several EU governments have already criticised the
proposals, and last week German Chancellor Angela Merkel
attacked the plans as a first step towards dismantling the
bloc's single market.
 A first meeting of EU government officials to discuss the
proposals in Brussels on Tuesday confirmed the widespread
opposition to the plans.
 ""There is huge opposition against the proposals by member
states, for several different reasons,"" the Belgian presidency
source told Reuters.
 Some officials agreed with Merkel's view that the proposals
would undermine the bloc's internal market, and others said they
would leave the EU and its member states open to challenges in
the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a second EU source in the
meeting said.
 On Wednesday, Washington's most senior trade official said
the proposals were unlikely to conform with ""internationally
accepted scientific standards"" on GM crops, suggesting that the
U.S. could be prepared to challenge them if adopted by the EU.
 
 FOOD CHAIN FEARS
 Last week, European industry associations representing the
entire food chain expressed their ""deep concern"" at the
Commission's proposals in a letter sent to the Belgian
presidency, the Commission and EU lawmakers.
 ""The new approach on GM cultivation sets a dangerous legal
precedent, jeopardizing the internal market for authorised
products,"" the letter seen by Reuters said.
 Letting member states decide on GM crops will create new
legal and commercial risks for operators, added the letter,
which was signed by EU farm group Copa-Cogeca, food and drink
industry confederation CIAA, and biotech lobby EuropaBio, among
others.
 EU government ambassadors will meet in Brussels to discuss
the proposals on September 3, when they are expected to create a
special working group of member state environment and
agriculture experts to lead talks on the plans.
 EU agriculture ministers will then debate the proposals in
Brussels at the end of September, followed by environment
ministers meeting in Luxembourg in mid-October.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2010 12:44PM ET</span>",Medvedev orders crackdown on Russian energy waste,"* President says Russia lags world in energy efficiency
 * Russia wastes enough energy to power France for year
 
 By Alexei Anishchuk
 MOSCOW, July 29 (Reuters) - Russia, the world's biggest
energy producer, wastes $38.5 billion worth of heat a year due
to poorly insulated buildings, President Dmitry Medvedev said on
Thursday as he kicked off a campaign for energy efficiency.
 Russia wastes enough energy annually to power France for a
year, and reducing wasteful domestic consumption could allow
Russia to boost the competitiveness of its industry and export
more oil and gas abroad, according to the World Bank.
 Medvedev said Russia lagged the rest of the world in energy
efficiency despite its famously harsh winters. He ordered
officials to improve building insulation and make the crumbling
Soviet-era city heating systems more efficient.
 ""Our country is an outsider when it comes to world ratings
of the heat efficiency of buildings,"" Medvedev told a meeting of
senior Kremlin and government officials.
 ""This is a cumulative problem connected with dilapidated
buildings and technology which was being used 30, 40 or 50 years
ago, but we need to overcome this backwardness,"" he said.
 ""Investment in this sector could save almost 70 million
tonnes of oil equivalent a year,"" Medvedev said. At current
market prices, 70 million tonnes of oil is worth $38.5 billion.
 Russia is the world's biggest oil and gas producer but
officials say cheap, government-capped domestic energy prices
have sapped the motivation to conserve energy.
 Medvedev, who was sworn in as president in May 2008, has
called for modernising Russia's economy to reduce dependence on
the fluctuations of world prices for oil and gas, which make up
65 percent of Russia's exports.
 Speaking to officials about the reform of the education,
agriculture, housing and health sectors, Medvedev said he was
tired of hearing fluffy ideas and wanted concrete proposals.
 ""Colleagues, I am really sick to death of reports saying the
same thing over and over again,"" he said.
 ""The plans are good but we need to talk about the problems,""
Medvedev said, adding that energy efficiency was a top priority.
 The so-called national projects, which Medvedev was tasked
with running in 2005 by then President Vladimir Putin, are aimed
at upgrading key sectors with a wave of state spending.
 Russia will spend 1.4 trillion roubles ($46 billion) over
the next three years on the housing, healthcare and education
projects, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov told Medvedev.
 He said the health reforms -- which included improving
hospital equipment, improving screening and increasing spending
-- had so far helped raise Russia's birth rate by 21 percent
and cut the death rate had fallen by 12 percent.

 * Euro trades above $1.31 for first time since early May

 (Adds comments, details. Updates prices)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 12-week high
against a broadly weaker dollar on Thursday as month-end demand
and supportive data helped push the single currency above a key
technical barrier.
 The euro's advance started early in the session after a
jump in euro zone economic sentiment to a 28-month high and a
decline in German unemployment. This contrasted with recent
weak data from the United States that has weighed broadly on
the dollar. Investors aremindful of figures on Friday expected
to show slower second quarter growth in the world's largest
economy.
 The lackluster U.S. data has reinforced the view benchmark
interest rates will remain at record lows in the country well
into 2011, while euro-denominated assets still offer higher
returns to investors.
 Investors who had been wary of buying the euro before
Europe's bank stress test results picked up the currency before
month end, as ongoing short covering also helped the euro.
 Investors sold dollars before the end of the month to hedge
the currency exposure on their holdings of U.S. assets,
Citibank analysts said.
 Euro gains accelerated once the currency went over $1.3050,
a level in which automatic buy-orders were triggered, forcing
investors to unwind bets against the euro, traders said.
 ""There are a lot of orders in the $1.3050 area which had
been targeted. When those were triggered it made for a higher
euro/dollar,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 In late morning in New York, the euro was up 0.6 percent at
$1.3065, its strongest since May 4. The single currency briefly
traded at $1.3106.
 EURO SHORTS UNWIND
 Traders cited demand for euros from an Asian central bank
in early European trade and they also welcomed news that the
Italian government's 25 billion ($32.54 billion) package of
austerity measures cleared a final hurdle. The package is
indented to shore up Italy's public finances.
 ""Economic resilience in Europe... despite the formidable
sovereign credit headwinds, continues to fuel an unwinding of
bets against the euro and push it higher across the board,""
said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange, in Washington, D.C.
 But Esiner warned that while the euro is likely to enjoy
continued support over the near-term, especially if U.S. data
remains weak, its gains may prove limited if concerns about a
slowing U.S. economy widen to include the broader global
economy.
 The dollar index fell 0.7 percent to 81.535. The
euro has risen around 7 percent versus the dollar this month. A
upcoming trading target for the single currency is seen at
$1.3125, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
peak-to-trough move from November 2009 to June.
 MONTH-END EURO DEMAND
 In a note, Citibank analysts said investors continued to
buy U.S. equities into the end of July as U.S. stock markets
outperformed other global equities.
 This suggests that investors will be on balance net sellers
of dollars to bring their hedges in line with the increased
value of their U.S. assets,"" they said, adding that the signal
to sell dollars was ""quite strong"".
 The New Zealand dollar rose 0.4 percent to $0.7231,
recovering from an earlier fall after the central bank raised
interest rates by a quarter point, as widely expected, but
warned that further hikes could be more gradual.
 The New Zealand dollar's recovery was aided by a rise in
the Australian dollar, which climbed more than 1 percent to
$0.9004.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - Robust quarterly
earnings from U.S. and European companies drove up world stocks
early Thursday, while the euro hit a 12-week high against the
dollar on better-than-expected economic data in Europe.
 Optimism about a sustained economic recovery grew following
results from Exxon Mobil Corp , Rolls Royce Plc 
and BAE Systems Plc , against the backdrop of improving
economic figures.
 A jump in euro zone economic sentiment to a 28-month high
and a decline in German unemployment supported the euro's
gains. For details, see [ID:nLDE66S0VN] and [ID:nLDE66S0PL]
 For its part, U.S. initial jobless claims dropped by 11,000
to a seasonally adjusted 457,000 in the latest week, versus the
forecast of 459,000, the government said. [ID:nN28202832]
 Global equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World
Index <.MIWD00000PUS> added 0.41 percent, and the Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> put on 0.47 percent.
 ""Second-quarter results are better than expected, and it
supports the market,"" said Emmanuel Morano, head of equity
management at fund management firm UFG-LFP in Paris.
 He added: ""The big question is, is this a pause in the

Tokyo's Nikkei average <.N225> ended down 0.6 percent after

 'EUROPEAN RESILIENCE'
 All told, U.S. economic data have shown pockets of
softening. Wednesday's weak U.S. durable goods figures added to
concerns about the outlook for the world's largest economy.
 The Fed's Beige Book, a summary of national economic
conditions, also showed activity was not as robust in a few
districts and lost steam in recent weeks.
 California's declaration of a state of emergency over its
finances also hurt the dollar.
 In New York trading, the dollar was down against a basket
of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index
<.DXY> off 0.74 percent at 81.57 from a previous session close
of 82.179.
The euro  advanced 0.75 percent at $1.309 from a

 U.S. Treasury debt prices were mixed.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 12-week high
against a broadly weaker dollar on Thursday as month-end demand
helped pushed the single currency above a key technical
barrier.
 A jump in euro zone economic sentiment to a 28-month high
and a decline in German unemployment supported the euro's
gains.
 This contrasted with recent weak data from the United
States that has weighed broadly on the dollar, with investors
mindful that figures on Friday are expected to show slower
economic growth in the country in the second quarter.
 ""Economic resilience in Europe, particularly in Germany,
despite the formidable sovereign credit headwinds, continues to

the euro went above $1.3050.
 ""There are a lot of orders in the $1.3050 area which had
been targeted. When those were triggered it made for a higher
euro/dollar,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 Market participants said demand for euros from an Asian
central bank in early European trade had sparked wider demand
for the single currency, helping push the dollar to a
three-month low versus a currency basket. The dollar index fell
0.7 percent to 81.535.
 The euro has risen around 7 percent versus the dollar this
month. A upcoming trading target for the single currency is
seen at $1.3125, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
peak-to-trough move from November 2009 to June.
 Comments by a top Moody's Investors Services sovereign
analyst on the U.S. worsening debt situation may have
contributed to selling in the dollar, some traders said.
 Steve Hess, a senior credit officer at Moody's, told Dow
Jones Newswires the U.S. government needs to elaborate a
credible plan to address its soaring debt in order to maintain
its Aaa credit rating.
 MONTH-END EURO DEMAND
 Analysts said investors who had been wary of buying the
euro before last week's bank stress test results were picking
up the single currency again before the month ends, while
ongoing short covering would also work in the euro's favor.
 Citibank analysts said investors at the same time would
sell dollars before the end of the month to hedge the currency
exposure on their holdings of U.S. assets.
 In a note, they said investors continued to buy U.S.
equities into the end of July as U.S. stock markets

 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 10 (Reuters) - South Africa public sector
unions representing more than a million workers staged a one-day
strike on Tuesday and threatened an extended labour stoppage
that could deal a blow to Africa's largest economy.
 The following scenarios look at what may come next in the
dispute that could crimp commerce and swell the budget:
 
 GOVERNMENT BENDS TO UNIONS' DEMANDS
 * The most likely outcome is for a deal to be reached in the
coming days, or at least before September, tilted in favour of
the unions, analysts said.
 * Precedent of workers at state-owned firms getting wage
increases of more than 8 percent, roughly double the country's
inflation rate, bodes well for public sector workers receiving
pay hikes close to their demand of 8.6 percent.
 * Ruling African National Congress' (ANC) goal to cut a
deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP will come under pressure due to
the need to assuage long-time union allies who feel they are
owed favours after helping Jacob Zuma ascend to the presidency.
 * The government last week raised its pay offer to 7 percent
from a previous 6.5 percent and unions said it slightly
increased its offer of 630 rand ($85) a month for the housing
allowance. Unions want 1,000 rand for housing.
 
 UNIONS TRY BRINKMANSHIP
 * Organised labour is trying to force the government's hand
by threatening a prolonged walkout of civil servants in a strike
that could be as severe as a 2007 labour action that dented the
economy.
 * Rallies were smaller than expected on Tuesday and public
services ministry said there was little impact from the strike,
which could put pressure on labour to reach a deal because its
leverage may not be as large as it would like.
 * Various unions could down tools in staggered strikes in
coming days and their coalition may try more national strikes
but analysts see a low possibility of a prolonged action by all
of the union members that would have major economic
ramifications.
 
 FULL SCALE STRIKE
 * But union anger has been brewing against Zuma and the ANC
for not pushing policies that benefit workers.
 * Unions may try to gain the upper hand politically with an
all-out strike that would tarnish Zuma as he heads into a
crucial ANC policy-setting meeting in September. This is seen as
unlikely because it would be difficult for unions to ask members
to forgo wages for a prolonged period for a strike mostly fought
for ideological reasons.
 
 BUDGET WOES
 * The government will have greater difficulty trimming its
yawning budget deficit due to its high wage bill, already a
third of total spending.
 * Zuma's ANC has little room to cut spending or risk
alienating loyal voters by failing to deliver on promises of
electricity, running water and quality education to the
country's legions of poor.
 * State borrowing could rise, worrying ratings agencies and
making it more costly to issue new debt.

 By Jon Herskovitz
 JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Reuters) - Thousands of South African
public service workers seeking higher wages walked off the job
on Thursday, with union leaders saying the strike could set the
stage for nearly 1 million workers downing tools next week.
 The initial labour action was likely to have little impact
on Africa's largest economy but a wider action including customs
officers, healthcare workers and government clerks could slam
the brakes on trade and commerce, analysts said.
 Workers including nurses, teachers and immigration officers
have rejected the government's 6.5 percent wage offer and were
demanding an 8.6 percent increase and a 1,000 rand ($135)
monthly housing allowance.
 Even though the government is worried about swelling the
budget by giving nearly 1 million workers raises about double
the inflation rate of 4.2 percent, it will likely bow to its
long-time union allies to avoid a repeat of a crippling public
sector strike in 2007, analysts said.
 ""The minister indicated that he will talk to us today and
make his final offer,"" said Manie De Clercq, spokesman for the
Public Servants Association (PSA), which has more than 200,000
members.
 Far fewer than half of the PSA's members took part in the
strike on Thursday but more would soon join if the government
offer is not seen as good enough, he said. 
 Public sector unions in the country's largest umbrella
labour group COSATU have threatened to join the PSA's labour
action as early as next week, swelling the number of potential
strikers to 900,000 in what could be the biggest public works
stoppage in about 3 years.
 Analysts expect a deal to be reached as the two sides have
narrowed differences and given the government's record of often
buckling in wage negotiations with organised labour, a long-time
ally of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
 ""At the end of the day, there will be a political
solution,"" said Sakhela Buhlungu, a professor at the University
of Johannesburg who is an expert on organised labour.
 
 PLEADING POVERTY
 Buhlungu said there is growing anger in public sector unions
about how the government has conducted negotiations and they
have been gathering leverage to force the government's hand.
 ""No amount of pleading poverty on the part of the government
is going to work,"" said Buhlungu, who recently published a book
on COSATU and its relationship with the ANC.
 Unions helped President Jacob Zuma ascend to the country's
top post and are a key constituency for him keeping power. 
 But Zuma's government has also faced anger from a growing
middle class for allowing wage increases at state-owned
enterprises more than double the inflation rate, which have been
seen by many as leading to higher utility bills and prices.
 Workers at state power utility Eskom won a 9 percent pay
increase early this month after threatening to strike during the
June 11-July 11 soccer World Cup. 
 Transport sector workers won a similar settlement in May
after a three-week strike that cost nearly $1 billion in lost
production and sales. 
 South Africa's inflation rate slowed to 4.2 percent in June.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2010 09:04AM ET</span>","China eyes gradual fiscal exit, no rate rise -IMF"," BEIJING, July 29 (Reuters) - Subdued inflation is reducing
the need for higher interest rates in China, which intends to
withdraw its fiscal stimulus gradually, the International
Monetary Fund said on Thursday.
 Chinese policymakers, in the course of an annual policy
review with the IMF, said that debt strains in Europe had
increased their worries about the global economic recovery,
making them more cautious about unwinding anti-crisis measures.
 ""Over a longer horizon, they were also concerned that
the process of fiscal consolidation in Europe, Japan, and the
U.S. had the potential to lower global growth with longer-lasting
negative spillovers to China,"" the IMF said.
 The comments were contained in a report drawn up by IMF staff
as the basis for an evaluation by the fund's board of directors
of China's policy stance.
 For the most part, the report is glowing. China, it said, ""is
contributing greatly toward ensuring strong, sustained, and
balanced global growth"".
 Central bank officials, responding to the IMF's call for less
reliance on credit quotas, indicated they were fully committed to
a greater use of indirect monetary policy instruments.
 ""They noted, however, that, with a benign inflation outlook,
there was less need for higher nominal interest rates at this
point,"" the report said. They were concerned that higher interest
rates could risk fueling capital inflows.
 On fiscal policy, officials told the fund that they had yet
to decide their stance in 2011. Any eventual withdrawal of
stimulus would be ""measured and gradual"", but over the longer
term they wanted to return to a balanced budget.
 CURRENCY SPAT
 China has blocked publication of the staff report for the
past three years because it objected to the fund's view that the
yuan, also known as the renminbi, needed to be a lot stronger.
 Even this year's final report omits a staff estimate,
contained in a draft version, that the yuan is between 5 percent
and 27 percent undervalued. [ID:nTOE66Q092]
 The IMF board, in conclusions released on Wednesday, declined
to endorse the staff's description of the yuan as substantially
undervalued, though some directors said it was too low.
 The long-running disagreement between China and the fund's
economists over the exchange rate is laid bare in the report.
 The Beijing authorities did not view China's rapid build-up
of international reserves as ""compelling"" evidence of meaningful
yuan undervaluation and disputed the IMF staff's view that the
recent drop in China's current account surplus was temporary.
 They believed the surplus would shrink further before
stabilising at around 4 percent of GDP by the end of this year.
That would be an appropriate level for China and would imply
negligible yuan undervaluation, according to policymakers.
 ""They viewed the level of the renminbi right now as much
closer to equilibrium than at any time before,"" the report said.
 In the staff's eyes, however, holding the current account
surplus down would be an ""exceptionally complicated exercise in
macroeconomic engineering"".
 The report took stock of several near-term risks for China:
 OVERHEATING
 The IMF expects inflation to begin falling in the second half
of 2010 and settle around 2-3 percent over the next few years.
 It said wages were rising in the 10-15 percent range, but
this was no higher than in previous years and reflected
productivity gains rather than tightness in the labour market.
 Moreover, rising wages do not appear to pass through into
higher domestic inflation. ""At this point in the recovery, there
is little evidence that the upswing in inflation is coming from
either binding capacity constraints, rapid growth in broad
monetary aggregates, or demand pressures,"" the report said.
 PROPERTY SECTOR
 A property bubble is beginning to inflate in some larger
cities. The IMF's modelling suggests prices in Beijing were 20
percent above fair value at the end of March.
 ""Nonetheless, at a national level, it does not seem as if
property prices are significantly above fundamentals,"" it said.
 Policymakers were ""acutely aware"" of the risk of asset price
inflation, not least due to Japan's experience in the 1980s, and
indicated that research into a property tax was under way.
 LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES
 Sparse information made it ""exceedingly difficult"" to assess
the risks that borrowing by local government finance vehicles
imply for the banking system.
 ""Indeed, officials indicated they were only now putting in
place systems to identify and measure the level of recourse to
these financing arrangements,"" the report said.
 IMF staffers said China should think of setting up a
municipal bond market to formalise local government financing,
while a ""meaningful"" property tax would lessen local governments'
reliance on land sales as a source of revenue.
 BANKING SYSTEM
 Last year's record credit spree will generate non-performing
loans that will strain banks' balance sheets in coming years.
 But profitability is solid, most banks are well capitalised
and provisioning levels are being increased. ""At this point, the
banking system looks well-placed to withstand a significant
deterioration in credit quality,"" the fund concluded.
 In an annex on the sustainability of China's public sector
debt, the Fund reckons that recognising implicit or contingent
liabilities would increase the debt burden by 16.8 percent of
2010 GDP, taking it to 36.0 percent of GDP.
 The estimate assumes that unfunded pension liabilities,
realised losses from non-performing loans and interest on bonds
issued to cover NPLs are made explicit and brought on budget.
 On that basis, the IMF projects that China's total public
sector debt will rise to 61.0 percent of GDP by 2015.

 By Olzhas Auyezov
 KIEV, July 29 (Reuters) - Ukraine will use $2 billion out of
its new $15 billion IMF facility to finance its budget deficit
this year and will stick to tight fiscal targets imposed by the
deal, government officials said on Thursday.
 The cash-strapped former Soviet republic expects to receive
the first $1.89 billion disbursement under the deal within a few
days, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Tigipko's office said in a
statement. The second tranche is expected in late December.
 The IMF board on Wednesday finalised a new $15 billion loan
agreement negotiated with Ukraine's new government that requires
it to tighten public finances.
 Ukraine will use part of this year's disbursements to
finance its budget deficit and spend the rest on boosting
central bank reserves, the deputy prime minister said.
 ""According to the terms of the cooperation programme,
Ukraine will get $2 billion to cover the 2010 budget deficit but
starting from next year all funds will be used only to replenish
central bank reserves,"" Tigipko said.
 The IMF deal requires Ukraine to keep its budget deficit
within 5.5 percent of gross domestic product this year and cut
it to 3.5 percent of GDP next year using unpopular measures such
as increasing gas tariffs and raising the retirement age.
 The IMF suspended Ukraine's previous $16.4 billion facility
last year after the previous government reneged on fiscal
constraint pledges.
 
 STRICTER POSITION
 ""Ukraine, under the previous IMF programme, always had
difficulties meeting the key performance criteria and had to ask
for waivers,"" Renaissance Capital brokerage said in a note on
Thursday.
 ""Currently, the IMF's position seems to be stricter, as
Ukraine had to meet the most arguable requirements as
prerequisites for the programme's approval.""
 The government has already announced a 50 percent hike in
gas prices for households from Aug. 1 and related adjustments to
other utility fees. But even that may not be enough, Renaissance
Capital said.
 ""We think the main challenge for the Ukrainian government
before the next IMF review (expected in November 2010) will be
to keep the budget deficit in line with the plan.""
 Ukraine's government said in a separate statement it would
stick to agreed targets.
 ""Ukraine will ... diligently meet all the obligations it has
taken on,"" the government said.
 Athanasios Arvanitis, the head of IMF mission to Ukraine,
told a conference call on Thursday that while the August gas
price hike would be sufficient for this year, further
adjustments would be necessary in the future.
 ""Gas tariffs will need to continue to increase,"" he said.
 
 MORE INVESTOR APPETITE
 Ukrainian debt valuations have already improved
significantly since the preliminary IMF deal was announced in
early July but analysts say the fund's final decision has
further boosted investor confidence.
 ""Sovereign spreads have room to tighten now ... and many
corporate names are punished by higher sovereign spreads,"" Oleg
Larichev, Managing Director of Troika Dialog Asset Management
told Reuters Insider TV.
 Analysts say the IMF deal also strengthens the case for
hryvnia revaluation by supporting the balance of payments and
pushing Ukraine's central bank towards allowing more
appreciation.
 ""We believe that Ukraine, given the structure of its economy
... is best served by having a flexible exchange rate policy,""
Arvanitis said.
 ""We believe that the central bank should focus its efforts
towards establishing a low inflation environment.""

 By Ratnajyoti Dutta
 NEW DELHI, July 29 (Reuters) - India's monsoon surged in
the past week to deliver its highest weekly rainfall this
season, raising hopes of strong harvests in the world's leading
consumer of rice, cooking oils and sugar.
 Revived monsoon rains and higher food output would spur the
government to lift a ban on wheat exports, which would calm
prices that surged to a 13-month high on Wednesday on worries
of dwindling supplies from drought-hit Russia.
 Adequate monsoon rains would also encourage India to lift a
ban on exports of non-basmati rice and levy a tax on sugar
imports, which it freed of duty after drought hit domestic
output last year.
 Monsoon rains, crucial for a rebound in farm output after
last year's drought, were 38 percent above normal in the week
to July 28, bouncing back from a 17-percent deficit the
previous week, data from the India Meteorological Department
showed on Thursday.

 Heavy, well-distributed showers in the past week cut the
shortfall in monsoon rains from the start of June to 5 percent
on Wednesday from 16 percent 10 days ago.
 This is expected to boost planting and production of
oilseeds, rice and cane in the world's top vegetable oils
buyer, biggest sugar consumer and leading rice consumer if
rainfall is normal in coming weeks.
 ""Rainfall in August will still be very important. If rains
continue to be like this in August, then agricultural
productivity would be very good,"" said Gurbachan Singh, India's
agriculture commissioner.
 The weather office said in its latest forecast that
widespread rainfall was expected in most parts of India,
particularly in the cane- and rice-growing northern regions in
the next five days.
 ""Heavy rains in the past week can be credited to developing
La Nina effect on the Indian monsoon,"" D. Sivananda Pai,
director at the western city Pune-based National Climate
Center, told Reuters.
 Pai, a leading forecaster at the India Meteorological
Department, last week said the gap in the monsoon rains in the
June-September period would narrow despite a lean patch in the
middle of July. [ID:nSGE66K0IL]
 India's policymakers hope good monsoon rains will help rein
in soaring inflation, which has stood in double digit figures
for five consecutive months.
 India's opposition has stalled proceedings in parliament
for the third straight day over rising prices, attacking the
federal government on what is proving to be a major policy
challenge.

 By Anis Ahmed
 DHAKA, July 29 (Reuters) - Bangladesh on Thursday nearly
double the minimum wage for millions of workers in the key
export garment industry, but the raise is unlikely to end weeks
of protests that have disrupted production.
 Labour Minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said the new
minimum wage would be 3,000 taka ($43), up from 1,662 taka
($24) but far short of labour union demands of 5,000 taka.
 The increase will take effect on November 1, 2010,
Mosharraf said.
 Bangladesh-based factories make garments for international
brands such JC Penney, Wal-Mart, H&M, Kohl's, Marks & Spencer,
Zara and Carrefour.
 These are Bangladesh's biggest export, accounting for more
than 80 percent of the impoverished country's annual export
earnings of $16 billion, but garment industry workers earn
wages well below the poverty line.
 Workers' unions, which took part in discussions with a
government-appointed wage board this week, have repeatedly said
they would not accept any wage increase below the 5,000 taka
they have demanded.
 Factory owners are also unhappy about the increase, saying
it would cut into their profits and possibly affect the
country's competitiveness as a manufacturing hub.
 Dozens of workers were injured in clashes with police last
month at protests over salaries and working conditions that
disrupted production at several factories.
 NEW WAGES STILL SEEN LOW
 Garment factory owners, at a meeting on Wednesday, set
conditions for agreeing to the higher wage, including
suspending bonuses usually given during festivals. It was not
clear if the government had accepted any of these conditions.
 ""We would like to pay the higher wages as we are being
pressed by the workers and the authorities,"" Abdus Salam
Murshedy, president of Bangladesh Garments Manufaturers and
Exporters Association, said before the minister's announcement.
 But for this to be possible, Murshedy said factory owners
want the government give them subsidies and cash incentives, as
well as lower taxes.
 The garment sector is Bangladesh's second biggest employer
after agriculture, with about 4,500 factories employing about
3.5 million workers, with many toiling in dangerous conditions.
 Earlier this month, Prime minister Sheikh Hasina told
parliament that garment workers' wages were ""not only
inadequate but also inhumane.""
 Dr Badiul Alam Majumdar, country director of non-profit
organisation, The Hunger Project, said the increased wage was
still not enough for workers to sustain a decent life.
 ""It will not bring any solution to the problems nor will it
be helpful to lift the image of the country. With this minimum
wage it is not possible for someone to make living for himself,
let alone support his family,"" Majumdar said.

 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, July 29 (Reuters) - France's Dassault Aviation
reported a pick-up in business jet orders but the maker of
Falcon jets said the sector was finding it hard to spread its
wings due to Europe's debt crisis and a glut of used planes.
 Dassault said cancellations were in the business jet market,
which is worth $20 billion a year, were decreasing but new
orders were taking time to pick up again.
 ""Our market correlates entirely with the general economy.
There were signs of a pick-up earlier this year..then the Greek
crisis happened and the market froze up again and confidence
disappeared,"" Chief Executive Charles Edlestenne said.
 ""The market in China is beginning to open up ... (but) will
depend on the pace of privatisations,"" he told a news

 Dassault had net sales of two Falcon jets in the first half,
compared with 56 net cancellations in the first half of last
year when the industry was hit by the financial crisis and a
political storm over corporate perks in the United States.
 ""Owing to the significant number of available-for-sale

the company said in a mid-year results statement on Thursday.
 In recent months, some manufacturers and suppliers have said
that rising flight activity and a decline in the number of used
aircraft for sale competing with new planes signal that the
market has likely hit the bottom of its decline.

 Dassault, which also makes the Rafale warplane, doubled its
first-half operating income to 248 million euros, due in part to
improved currency hedging, and net sales of 1.99 billion euros,
up 44 percent.
 Net income excluding its stake in French defence electronics
maker Thales rose 37 percent to 170 million euros.
 The company, which competes with Textron subsidiary Cessna,
General Dynamics' unit Gulfstream and Canada's Bombardier, said
it expected its 2010 net sales to be comparable to last year's
1.38 billion euros, anticipating deliveries of around 85 Falcons
and 11 Rafales.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit an 11-week high
against a broadly weak dollar on Thursday as month-end demand
for the single currency helped push it above a key barrier.
 Market participants said demand for euros from an Asian
central bank in early European trade had sparked wider demand
for the single currency, helping push the dollar to a
three-month low versus a currency basket. 
 By 1001 GMT, the euro had climbed 0.7 percent on the day to
$1.3085 on electronic trading platform EBS, its highest since
May 10.
 Gains in the euro helped push the dollar down to 81.596
versus a currency basket, its weakest since late April.
 ""There are a lot of orders in the $1.3050 area which had
been targeted. When those were triggered it made for a higher
euro/dollar,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 ""It's a matter of technical factors that is driving the
market today.""
 Data showing a slide in Germany's jobless rate in July and a
rise in euro zone economic sentiment this month also helped to
support the single currency.
 Stop-loss orders in the euro triggered above $1.3050
accelerated gains the currency's gains, market players said.
 Investors are now focusing on whether the euro can extend
its rally to $1.3125, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of
the single currency's peak-to-trough move from November 2009 to
June.
 Against the yen, the euro rose around 0.4 percent to a
session high of 114.21 yen according to Reuters data, recovering
from early losses and edging back up towards 114.74 yen struck
on EBS on Wednesday.
 The euro slipped in Asian trade due to month-end selling by
Japanese exporters, Tokyo-based traders said, adding that more
offers may emerge if the euro rises towards 115 yen.
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 87.07 yen, and posted
bigger losses against sterling, which hit a five-month high, and
against the Australian and New Zealand currencies.
 Some in the market said California Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger's announcement that the state was in a state of
emergency over its finances was another reason to dump the
dollar as it highlighted the fiscal problems in the country.
 
 MONTH-END EURO DEMAND
 Analysts said investors who had been wary of buying the euro
before last week's bank stress test results were picking up the
single currency again before the month ends, while ongoing short
covering would also work in the euro's favour.
 At the same time, Citi analysts said investors would sell
dollars before the end of the month to hedge the currency
exposure on their holdings of U.S. assets.
 In a note, they said investors continued to buy U.S.
equities into the end of July as U.S. stock markets outperformed
the rise in other global equities.
 ""This suggests that investors will be on balance net sellers
of USD to bring their hedges in line with the increased value of
their U.S. assets,"" they said, adding that the signal to sell
dollars was ""quite strong"".
 Analysts said that despite a run of weak U.S. economic data,
ongoing optimism about second-quarter corporate earnings would
add to the view of an improving global economy and support
shares, keeping euro demand intact.
 European stocks rose 0.4 percent on Friday.
 The New Zealand dollar rose 1.0 percent to $0.7286,
recovering from an earlier fall after the central bank raised
interest rates by a quarter point, as widely expected, but
warned that further hikes could be more gradual.
 The New Zealand dollar's recovery was aided by a rise in the
Australian dollar, which climbed more than 1 percent to $0.9038,
nearing an 11-week high hit earlier in the week.

 MOSCOW, July 29 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble inched lower
against a basket of currencies on Thursday but stayed within
sight of 10-week peaks against the dollar thanks to strong oil
prices and a rise in the euro, but it may now lose support as
the month-end tax period is over.
 By 0740 GMT, the rouble was down 3 kopecks at 34.36 against
the euro-dollar basket , slowly heading away from
July's peak of 34.23 after the end of a domestic tax period in
which companies buy roubles to cover their payments.
 ""A rise in the basket may be attributed to a rise in the
euro against the dollar. Some expectations of a firmer (basket)
are emerging, and the demand for foreign currencies may increase
as a new month closes in,"" said Sergei Romanchuk, chief dealer
at Metallinvestbank.
 The rouble is likely to lose support from Russian exporters
who have been actively converting their dollar and euro revenues
to meet local liabilities.
 ""The supply (of foreign currencies) is waning, while Russian
importers and big local banks are buying (dollars and euros),"" a
dealer at a major Western bank in Moscow said.
 Against the dollar, the rouble firmed 3 kopecks to 30.23
, staying within 6 kopecks of the 10-week high
scaled on Tuesday. Versus the euro, it gave up 10 kopecks to
39.40 .
 However, oil prices -- the key gauge for the rouble --
remained at strong levels above $76 per barrel [O/R], ensuring
inflows into Russia's export-focused economy.
 The rouble, which market players call a derivative of oil
prices, has moved in a channel between 29 and 32 to the dollar
for about a year as oil prices have held in a $65-$85 band.
 Equity markets were also in the rouble's favour, with
Russia's benchmark RTS <.IRTS> and MICEX <.MCX> indexes gaining
0.5-0.7 percent.
 Dealers say investors are avoiding taking big positions in
the summer-thinned market and prefer to take a wait-and-see
stance ahead of August, which has a reputation for bringing
political and financial shocks in Russia.
 Events that have taken markets by surprise in August include
Russia's sovereign default in 1998 and war with Georgia in 2008.

 LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit an 11-week high
against a broadly weak dollar on Thursday as month-end demand
for the single currency helped push it beyond a key barrier.
 Market participants said some Asian central banks were
buying the euro, helping to push the dollar to a three-month low
versus a currency basket. 
 By 0826 GMT, the euro had climbed 0.7 percent on the day to
$1.3073 according to electronic trading platform EBS, its

 Data showing a slide in Germany's unemployment rate to 7.6
percent in July, adding to other recent upbeat data on Europe's
biggest economy, also helped to support the single currency.
 Other analysts added that investors who had been wary of
buying the euro before last week's bank stress test results had
resumed picking up the single currency before the month ends,
while position adjustments would also work in the euro's favour.
 ""A lot of people are still covering short positions in the
euro, and that will continue,"" said John Hydeskov, senior
currency analyst at Danske in Copenhagen.
 Analysts said ongoing optimism about second-quarter U.S.
corporate earnings would add to the view of an improving global
economy, which would support shares and keep euro demand intact.
European stocks rose 0.5 percent in early trade.
 
 $1.3125 IN FOCUS
 Stop-loss orders in the euro above $1.3050 helped to
accelerate the euro's move higher, traders said, while more
orders were seen lined up through $1.3080.
 Analysts said euro support was growing around $1.30, as the
single currency has managed to end New York trade and begin the
Asian session around that level every day so far this week.
 With the $1.3050 level broken, investors focused on whether
the euro can extend its rally to $1.3125, the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the single currency's peak-to-trough
move from November 2009 to June.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.3 percent to 113.92 yen,
recovering from early losses and edging towards 114.74 yen
struck on trading platform EBS on Wednesday.
 The euro had slipped in Asian trade due to month-end selling

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2010 05:00AM ET</span>",Bangladesh poised to raise wages for garment workers," By Anis Ahmed
 DHAKA, July 29 (Reuters) - The Bangladesh government was
set on Thursday to nearly double the minimum wage for millions
of workers in the key export garment industry, but the raise is
unlikely to end weeks of protests that have disrupted
production.
 A government-appointed board grouping officials,
representatives from workers' unions and the industry
association recommended this week raising the minimum wage to
3,000 taka ($43) from 1,662 taka ($24).
 Bangladesh-based factories make garments for international
brands such JC Penney, Wal-Mart, H&M, Kohl's, Marks & Spencer,
Zara and Carrefour.
 These are Bangladesh's biggest export, accounting for more
than 80 percent of the impoverished country's annual export
earnings of $16 billion, but garment industry workers earn
wages well below the poverly line.
 Workers' unions have repeatedly said they would not accept
any wage increase below the 5,000 taka they have demanded.
 Factory owners are also unhappy about the increase, saying
it would cut into their profits and possibly affect the
country's competitiveness as a manufacturing hub.
 Dozens of workers were injured in clashes with police last
month at protests over salaries and working conditions that
disrupted production at several factories.
 ""The wage board recommendation was a far cry from the
workers' demand for 5,000 taka minimum wage,"" said Montu Ghosh,
a workers union leader.
 MANUFACTURERS SET CONDITIONS
 The wage board's recommendation has been handed over to
Labour and Employment Minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, who
is expected to announce the official increase on Thursday.
 Garment factory owners, at a meeting on Wednesday, set
conditions for agreeing to the higher wage.
 They want to delay implementing the increase until December
and suspend other bonuses usually given during festivals. It
was not clear if the government had accepted any of these
conditions.
 ""We would like to pay the higher wages as we are being
pressed by the workers and the authorities,"" said Abdus Salam
Murshedy, president of Bangladesh Garments Manufaturers and
Exporters Association.
 But for this to be possible, Murshedy said factory owners
want the government give them subsidies and cash incentives, as
well as lower taxes.
 Economist Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of
think-tank the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the wage
increase may actually attract ""ethical"" foreign firms to
Bangladesh.
 ""The wage increase for garment workers after four years
will have an overall positive impact on the country's garment
industry,"" he said.
 ""The buyers often press the garment manufacturers to pay
minimum standard wage to the workers. They insist on ethical
buying, showing reluctance to buy from those who pay workers
below minimum wage.""
 The garment sector is Bangladesh's second biggest employer
after agriculture, with about 4,500 factories employing about
3.5 million workers, with many toiling in dangerous conditions.
 Earlier this month, Prime minister Sheikh Hasina told
parliament that garment workers' wages were ""not only
inadequate but also inhumane.""
 Dr Badiul Alam Majumdar, country director of non-profit
organisation, The Hunger Project, said the increased wage was
still not enough for workers to sustain a decent life.
 ""It will not bring any solution to the problems nor will it
be helpful to lift the image of the country. With this minimum
wage it is not possible for someone to make living for himself,
let alone support his family,"" Majumdar said.

 * Dollar index falls after rising for five days

 * World stocks steady after a 4-day losing run
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply versus
Swiss franc on Monday and safe-haven U.S. and German government
bond yields hit new lows after much weaker than expected growth
numbers from Japan added to worries over a faltering global
economic recovery.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 lost 0.4 percent, while
U.S. stock index futures were flat to down 0.2 percent, pointing
to a softer start for Wall Street.
 Benchmark 10-year Germany yields hit a record low of 2.362
percent, while yields on 10-year U.S. government bonds fell 4
basis points to 2.6411 percent after touching a 16-month low of
2.638.
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds also reached a 16-month
low of 3.799 percent.
 ""What has been driving sentiment for a little while now has
been this concern about the loss of momentum in the global
recovery,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of
research at Brewin Dolphin in London.
 ""The GDP figures out of Japan this morning clearly didn't
help. For the balance of the month, we are probably not going to
go anywhere. The earnings season was very good but it's behind
us now.""
 The fall in Treasury yields has been a big factor weighing
on the U.S. currency against the yen, because of the high recent
correlation between dollar/yen and Treasury yields.
 The dollar eased 0.7 percent to 85.66 yen. Against a basket
of major currencies, the greenback was down 0.4 percent, after
rising in the previous five sessions.
 The euro fell 0.8 percent versus the franc at 1.3297.
However, the single currency was up around 0.5 percent at
$1.2812.
 
 GERMANY VS THE REST
 ""The problem for the euro is that growth is rather
concentrated in Germany, with the periphery still struggling,""
said analyst at Credit Agricole CIB in a client note.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish and Greek
government bonds rather than Germany Bunds rose, and the cost of
insuring their debt against default also increased.
 Japan's Nikkei fell 0.6 percent, recovering from an early
drop of as much as 1.7 percent after gross domestic product grew
just 0.1 percent in the second quarter compared to forecasts of
0.6 percent.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index,
however, were flat, after falling for four days in a row.
 ""There is nothing to cheer about,"" said Koen De Leus,
economist at KBC Securities. ""Economic figures, certainly in the
United States, are really disappointing and pointing towards
going more and more close to a double dip. This time, it doesn't
hurt to be little bit cautious."" 
 European numbers on Friday gave a bullish outlook on growth
for Germany but not necessarily many other euro zone economies
facing stringent budget cuts in the second half of this year.
Corporate earnings in the recent season have generally been good
but the market's biggest concern is the stumbling U.S. economy.
 In terms of valuations, MSCI Europe is looking cheaper than
U.S. S&P 500, Japan's TOPIX and MSCI emerging markets benchmark
.
 MSCI Europe carried a one-year forward price-to-earnings of
10.7, compared with 12.36 for S&P 500, 14.05 for TOPIX and 10.8
for MSCI emerging markets index, Thomson Reuters DataStream
showed.
In the commodity market, copper advanced 1 percent, helped
by lower inventories and a weaker dollar. Crude prices rose 0.4
percent, snapping a four-day losing run.

 * Lira trading close to two-month highs
 ISTANBUL, July 29 (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank raised
the foreign currency reserve requirement for the country's
banks to 10 percent from 9.5 percent, according to the state's
Official Gazette, as it continues to unwind emergency measures
adopted during the global financial crisis.
 The lira reserve requirement was maintained at 5 percent,
Thursday's edition of the Gazette said. The reserves are used
to cover the risk of bad loans.
 The central bank said in April that it would gradually
bring foreign exchange liquidity facilities back to pre-crisis
levels as global markets returned to normal.
 The bank cut the foreign exchange reserve requirement from
11 percent to 9 percent in Dec 2008 to provide more foreign
exchange liquidity to the banking sector during the peak of the
global crisis, which wiped out 4.7 percent of Turkey's gross
domestic product last year.
 However the Turkish economy is now enjoying robust
recovery, growing 11.7 percent in the first quarter.
 The central bank began lifting the foreign exchange reserve
requirement in April, withdrawing around $700 million of forex
liquidity from the market as it raised interest rates to 9.5
percent from 9.0 percent.
 Turkey's lira  recently strengthened against the
dollar and is now at a two-month high, and equities <.XU100>

 * Dollar index dips, support seen at 81.44
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - The euro dipped against the yen on
Thursday, pulling away from a recent two-month high on selling by
Japanese exporters, while the kiwi struggled after New Zealand's
central bank raised interest rates but warned further hikes could
be more gradual.
 The New Zealand dollar fell sharply after the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand signalled the pace of further interest rate hikes
would be less than earlier thought. The kiwi fell to a low near
$0.7205, from about $0.7280 before the announcement.
 After staging a mild recovery, the New Zealand dollar was up
0.4 percent from late U.S. trading on Wednesday at $0.7236..
 ""The neutral statement and revised market expectations for
future rate decisions will help in taking upside pressure off the
kiwi,"" Citi analyst Josh Williamson said.
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.3008,
hovering near its 11-week high of $1.3047 hit on trading platform
EBS earlier this week.
 But the euro dipped 0.2 percent against the yen to 113.49
yen, pulling away from its highest in more than two months of
114.74 yen struck on trading platform EBS on Wednesday.
 A trader for a Japanese bank cited euro-selling by Japanese
exporters before the month-end, adding that more offers were
likely to emerge if the euro rebounds and rises towards 115 yen.
 ""A lot of exporters are waiting at levels above 115 yen,"" the
trader said.
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent against the yen to 87.25,
extending losses after data on Wednesday showed new U.S. durable
goods orders unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in
June.
 Still, the core measure of orders excluding aircraft and
defence rose 0.6 percent in June, on top of an upwardly revised
4.6 percent jump in May, suggesting activity was not nearly as
soft as the headline number suggested.
 The dollar is likely to find support against the yen at
levels around 86.80 yen, near the dollar's intraday low hit on
Monday and Tuesday, said Teppei Ino, a technical analyst at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""There aren't strong reasons to bid up the yen beyond those
levels at the moment, especially ahead of key U.S. data on
Friday,"" Ino said. U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product
data is due out on Friday.
 A recent string of lacklustre U.S. economic data has weighed
on the greenback and led investors to cut short positions in the
euro.
 The single currency touched an 11-week high against the
dollar earlier this week, helped by strong bank earnings and
gains in European equities, following last week's favourable
results of regulatory stress tests.
 The dollar index was down 0.2 percent at 82.007, with
near-term support around 81.44, a 50 percent retracement of the
index's move from a low of 74.17 in November 2009 to a high near
88.71 in June.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday pointed to
a less-than-booming recovery with sluggish housing markets and
sales of costly items like new cars weakening.

 By Akiko Takeda
 TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers slashed
their weightings for equities to the lowest in more than 11 years
and rushed for cash on a strong yen and as a slump in share
prices intensified concerns over the global economic outlook.
 The average weightings for bonds also dropped for the first
time in two months as growing uncertainty on the U.S. economic
recovery made asset managers less keen to boost investment, a
Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
 ""Uncertainty about the U.S. economic outlook has intensified.
If the U.S. economy actually slows down then this would affect
Europe and would also make it difficult for emerging economies to
maintain their high growth,"" said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior
strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.
 ""We need to hold more cash positions as we are closely
watching the situation in the U.S. economy,"" Nagano said.
 The Reuters poll of 13 fund managers was conducted from July
14-23, during which the benchmark Nikkei stock average slipped
below 9,200, approaching this year's lows.
 The yield on the key 10-year Japanese government bond fell as
low as 1.045 percent -- its lowest since August 2003 -- during
the survey.
 The average weighting for equities dropped to 44.2 percent --
the lowest reading since February 1999 -- from 45.1 percent the
previous month, the poll showed.
 The bond weighting fell to 48.2 percent in July from 49.2
percent the previous month.
 Meanwhile, Japanese asset managers' cash positions jumped to
4.7 percent -- the highest since November.
 Fund managers raised their allocations of alternative
investments, such as hedge funds and commodities, to 1.7 percent
in July from 1.2 percent, while they maintained their weightings
for real estate at 1.2 percent from the previous month.
 ASIA BRIGHT
 In terms of regional allocations, fund managers raised their
weightings for Asian bonds and equities due to brighter economic
prospects in the region, while they cut their positions in
British assets.
 Within their equity portfolios, fund managers slightly
reduced their weightings for North America to 43.1 percent in
July from 43.5 percent the previous month, the survey showed.
 ""Investor sentiment is deteriorating very rapidly. The
employment situation in the United States needs to improve
consistently in order to boost overall sentiment,"" said Kenichi
Kubo, a senior fund manger at Tokio Marine Asset Management.
 Labour worries drove July consumer confidence to its lowest
since February, with one in six people expecting lower income in
the next six months.
 Allocations of British stocks dropped to 5.9 percent -- the
lowest reading since October 2004 -- from 6.1 percent.
 Weightings for Japan fell to a 2010 low of 21.6 percent in
July from 24.6 percent in June, it showed.
 In contrast, fund managers raised their weightings on the
euro zone to 13.2 percent from 10.9 percent, and lifted their
exposure to Asian shares to 9.9 percent -- the highest since
March 1997 -- from 8.9 percent.
 Within bond portfolios, managers lifted their positions in
North America and Asia, while slashing their weightings in the
euro zone, Britain and Japan.
 The weighting for euro zone bonds fell to a record low of
26.1 percent in July and fund managers' weightings for British
bonds dipped to a 14-year low of 6.0 percent.
 Meanwhile, allocations for North America jumped to a
three-year high of 33.0 percent in July from 30.1 percent.
 The weighting for Asian debt rose to the second highest level
ever, 4.4 percent, from 3.9 percent in June.

 TOKYO, July 29 (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged back up
towards a three-month high and the dollar eased towards
three-month lows on Thursday, hit by soft U.S. data that
highlighted the patchy nature of the U.S. economic recovery.
 An unexpected drop in U.S. June durable goods orders and a

 European shares were expected to open little changed to

 ""In Japan's case, poor indicators may keep the yen strong

 A Reuters poll showed annual U.S. growth in the second
quarter was expected to slow to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent in
the first quarter amid a cooling in consumer demand, and a
recent flurry of weak data suggest it lost more momentum
heading into summer.
 KIWI STRUGGLES, DOLLAR SOFT
 The New Zealand dollar fell sharply after the Reserve Bank

on the greenback and led investors to cut short positions in the
euro.
 The single currency touched an 11-week high against the
dollar at $1.3045 on Tuesday, helped by strong bank earnings and
gains in European equities, following last week's favourable
results of regulatory stress tests. [ID:nLDE66R1B8].
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down 0.14 percent at 82.07, with
near-term support at 81.44, the 50 percent retracement of the
index's move from a low of 74.17 in December 2009 to a high of
88.71 on June 7.
 The dollar was softer against the yen, at 87.41 yen ,
having shed 0.4 percent on Wednesday after a report showed new
durable goods orders unexpectedly fell for a second straight
month in June.
 Still, the core measure of orders excluding aircraft and
defence rose 0.6 percent in June, on top of an upwardly revised
4.6 percent jump in May, suggesting activity was not nearly as
soft as the headline number suggested.
 Traders in Tokyo expect the dollar to trade between 87.30 yen
to 87.80 yen with possible month-end selling of dollars by
Japanese exporters going through on Wednesday.

 * Also back panel to find ways to cut trade deficit
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers moved closer
on Wednesday to creating a commission to find ways to cut the
huge trade deficit with China and other countries, while also
pushing a strategy to promote U.S. manufacturing.
 The House of Representatives passed the bill on the
commission as part of a ""Make it in America"" agenda promoted by
Democrats before November's congressional elections to address
voters' concerns about persistently high U.S. unemployment.
 ""Make it in America is not just a slogan. It is an
objective to make that a reality,"" House Majority Leader Steny
Hoyer told reporters after the vote.
 The House also passed a bill to boost U.S. clean energy
technology exports and voted 379-38 for a bill requiring
President Barack Obama to develop a national strategy to
promote U.S. manufacturing.
 ""We must take action to support domestic manufacturing and
end the outsourcing of American jobs,"" said that bill's chief
sponsor, Representative Dan Lipinski. ""A strong manufacturing
sector is critical to leading America out of recession.""
 The Senate must approve all three measures and then the
president must sign them into law.
 The Senate passed a bill on Tuesday to help manufacturers
by temporarily suspending import duties on a long list of raw
materials used to make finished goods, as well as some foreign
products made with U.S. inputs.
 That legislation now goes to Obama, who is expected to sign
it. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates the
bill would raise U.S. manufacturing output by $4.6 billion and
support almost 90,000 jobs.
 Hoyer said the House would vote this week on legislation to
fund Build America Bonds by closing a tax ""loophole"" that
encourages companies to move jobs overseas. The taxable bonds
would be used to finance infrastructure projects through 2012.
 TRADE GAP ON THE RISE AGAIN
 The U.S. trade deficit was $375 billion in 2009, down
sharply from $699 billion in 2008 as result of the global
financial crisis that badly damaged world trade.
 But with U.S. economic growth on the rebound, the trade gap
has started widening again and already reached nearly $200
billion in the first five months of this year.
 A big portion of the trade deficit is with China, which
many lawmakers blame for heavy losses in U.S. manufacturing
jobs over the past decade.
 The bill by Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio would
set up a bipartisan commission to study the causes of the trade
gap, with a particular focus on foreign currency and trade
practices.
 It would require the panel, within 16 months of enactment,
to recommend to the White House and Congress specific
strategies for reducing the gap with China and other countries
such as Japan, Mexico and members of the 27-nation European
Union that run significant surpluses with the United States.
 An earlier version would have barred the White House from
submitting new trade deals to Congress until the panel
completed its work but that provision was dropped.
 Third Way, a moderate Washington think-tank, put out a
report on Wednesday saying widespread trade barriers and
anti-competitive practices by trade partners ""present a major
and evolving threat to U.S. exports.""
 The solution was not to engage in matching protectionism
but to recognize that trade deals boost exports and jobs, to
""pursue new trade agreements with urgency"" and to beef up
enforcement of existing trade pacts, the report said.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - World stocks fell, snapping
a four-day rally on Wednesday, as weak orders for U.S. durable
goods in June and the Federal Reserve's downbeat take on the
economy dampened the outlook and drove the dollar lower.
 New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell
unexpectedly for a second straight month, marking their
largest decline since August, in a fresh sign the economy had
slowed in the second quarter. But some analysts said the
report was respectable after stripping out certain categories.

 The Fed's Beige Book report, a summary of U.S. economic
conditions, indicated activity was not as robust in a few
districts and had lost steam over the past several weeks.
[ID:nN28200227]
 A rally built on strong earnings lifted the broad Standard
& Poor's 500 index on Monday to close above its 200-day moving
average, a closely watched measure of market direction.
 But the Fed's assessment of the economy and weak data
weighed on sentiment.
 ""Earnings have been good, but the overall economy is still
sluggish at best and is not coming back as much as we would
have hoped,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at
Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> dipped 0.12
percent, and the Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> was slightly lower.
 DESPITE PULLBACK, DOW UP FOR YEAR
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 39.81 points,
or 0.38 percent, to end at 10,497.88. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 7.71 points, or 0.69 percent, to finish
at 1,106.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slipped 23.69
points, or 1.04 percent, to close at 2,264.56.
 Even with Wednesday's decline, the Dow was still in
positive territory for the year, while the S&P 500 and the
Nasdaq were slightly lower for 2010 so far.
 With the S&P's 200-day moving average at about 1,114,
traders are trying to determine where it has peaked or
represents a consolidation point before further gains.
 U.S. corporate results continued to surprise on the
upside.
 Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp  and
ConocoPhillips , the third-largest U.S. oil company,
both posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profits.
 After almost half of the S&P 500 having reported earnings,
77 percent of companies have beat expectations, according to
Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research.
 The dollar fell against the yen and eased against the euro
as the weaker-than-expected reading of U.S. durable goods
orders added to fears about the economy. [ID:nN28204113]

$1.5630 as earlier comments from the Bank of England did
little to quell optimism about the UK economic outlook.
[ID:nLDE66R1R4]
 BONDS RISE AFTER AUCTION AND DATA
 The Commerce Department said U.S. durable goods orders
fell 1.0 percent in June after a revised 0.8 percent drop in
May. Analysts forecast an increase of 1.0 percent.
 But Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at
BNY Mellon in New York, said the durable goods report is
always difficult to digest. The number was negative because of
commercial aircraft orders, he said.
 ""If you strip out aircraft and defense, you're left with a
respectable rise of 0.6 percent"" in the important capital
goods category, he said.
 Those orders were up 15.2 percent on a year-on-year
basis.
 ""That's consistent with a strong recovery in industrial
production and durable goods orders. So these numbers are not
very concerning,"" Woolfolk said.
 Treasuries rose following a strongly bid auction of $37
billion in five-year notes, which sold at yields that were
lower than the same notes trading at the time in the open
market. [ID:nN28153578]
 ""The market just sort of took today's data and said, 'You
know what? There's still a huge demand for Treasuries; the
economy's not as strong as we want it, I think we'll go ahead
and buy these things,'"" said Todd Colvin, vice president at MF
Global in Chicago.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note 
gained 13/32 in price to yield 3.00 percent after trading flat

 TORONTO, July 28 (Reuters) - The Canadian currency fell for
a second straight session against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday,
dragged lower by U.S. data that signaled persistent headwinds
for the global recovery.
 The Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book reported overall
economic activity is still increasing but not robustly and in a
few areas has lost steam. [ID:nWALSIE6ES] It pointed to
sluggish housing markets and weakening sales of costly items
like new cars in the United States, by far Canada's biggest
trading partner.
 The Canadian dollar fell as low as C$1.0390 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.25 U.S. cents, nearly matching its overnight low,
following the U.S. summary of national economic conditions.
 ""The Beige Book is not flagging a double-dip recession but
it's also not painting a very flattering picture of the
economy,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital
Markets.
 ""Unfortunately, we're not seeing any bounce in home sales
even three months after the tax credit expired; we're not
seeing much improvement in labor markets,"" Guatieri said.
 The currency  finished not far off its low of the
day at C$1.0385 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.29 U.S. cents, down
from Tuesday's finish at C$1.0362 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.51
U.S. cents.
 Before the Fed's report was released, the Canadian dollar
had already given back gains from an earlier rally, in line
with declining equity markets, as conflicting U.S. reports
showed improved corporate earnings and falling orders for
durable goods.
 As well, oil slipped below $77 a barrel after economic and
industry data fueled doubts over the pace of recovery in energy
demand, which also weighed on the commodity-linked currency.

 BONDS EXTEND GAINS
 Canadian bond prices followed U.S. Treasury issues higher,
which were supported after a $37 billion auction of five-year
notes met with healthy demand and after the Beige Book. [US/]
 The Beige Book report also fit in with data that showed new
orders for U.S. manufactured goods like cars and planes fell
unexpectedly for a second straight month in June, posting the
largest drop since August. [ID:nN28189480]
 ""There's been a real lack of Canadian data this week so
we're trading off the U.S.,"" said Kam Bath, fixed income
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The durable goods report was soft, even though it's a very
volatile number; it weighed on sentiment.""
 While Statistics Canada presents its GDP figures for May at
the end of the week, the data is likely to be overshadowed by
U.S. second-quarter GDP numbers, due at the same time.
 The Canadian two-year bond  was up 8 Canadian
cents to yield 1.601 percent, while the 10-year bond
 gained 37 Canadian cents to yield 3.228 percent.
 Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. Treasury issues in the
short- and long-end of the curve, but underperformed in the
belly. The Canadian 10-year bond was 23 basis points above the
comparable U.S. bond, compared with 22.3 basis points in the

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rallied
against the euro but slid against the yen on Wednesday as
weaker-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders added to fears
about economic recovery in the world's largest economy.
 Also driving risk aversion was a Federal Reserve report
saying overall U.S. economic activity was not increasing
robustly and a few areas of the United States had lost steam
over the past several weeks.
 The Fed's Beige Book summary of national economic
conditions, based on information before July 19, pointed to a
less-than-booming recovery with sluggish housing markets and
weakening sales of costly items like new cars.
 ""Volume is really light and today people put a lot on
durable goods,"" said Phil Streible, senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldcock in Chicago.
 He said euro sellers were stepping in at the $1.3000 level
on the euro/dollar and there was little buying interest until
the $1.2750 level.
 ""It takes a lot of buying to hold things up but only little
buying to see it fall,"" Streible said.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro traded at
$1.2979, down 0.1 percent, with the session peak at $1.3041 and
the session low at $1.2968. Investors are still looking for
news that could push the single currency out of a recent range
after it topped $1.30 for the fifth time this month on
Wednesday.
 The dollar was 0.5 percent lower at 87.44 yen. It touched a
session low at 87.27.
 A report showed new orders for long-lasting U.S.
manufactured goods unexpectedly fell for a second straight
month in June, their biggest decline since August.
 A string of lackluster economic reports recently has
weighed on the greenback. On Friday, the government's first
reading on U.S. second quarter GDP is likely to show growth
slowed in the period amid a cooling in consumer spending and a
wider trade deficit.
 ""The U.S. data now is the main focus in the forex markets,
and it continues to come on the disappointing side,"" said
Amelia Bourdeau, a currency strategist at UBS AG in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 Investors are lacking ""conviction"" and trading in major
currency pairs will be limited to narrow ranges, she said. 
 ""We are past the good news from Europe on the stress tests
and earnings, which helped the euro, and I'm not sure if even
the U.S. GDP report on Friday will be able to break that
pattern,"" Bourdeau said.
 Friday's report on economic growth is forecast to mark
four straight quarters of expansion as the economy digs out of
its longest and deepest recession since the 1930s. But the
economy continues to run ""below its long-run growth potential,""
said Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer at Merk
Investments in Palo Alto, California.
 ""It may be hazardous to investors' wealth to think this
path won't be hazardous to the U.S. dollar,"" Merk said.
 EURO/DOLLAR CEILING
 Markets seemed comfortable with euro/dollar around $1.3000,
but investors were still wary of opening up new long euro
positions that would take it much higher, said BNY Mellon's
Michael Woolfolk.
 ""We came a long way this year, from $1.40 to below $1.20 in
the euro, and a lot of that was based on the fear factor. So
the retracement has been merely people taking out a lot of
those short positions,"" he added.
 Woolfolk said it will take a change in risk sentiment to
start a new trend in the pair.
 The euro touched an 11-week high against the dollar at
$1.3045 on Tuesday, helped by strong bank earnings and gains in
European equities, following last week's favorable results of
regulatory stress tests.
 Traders said an option barrier at $1.3050 would need to be
taken out for a move toward Fibonacci resistance at $1.3125,
which is a 38.2 percent retracement of the December-June move.

 * Credit crisis marked peak of financial sector mushrooming
 * As crisis eases and finance rolled back, hope for normalcy
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - There has been just an inkling
in recent weeks that financial markets might start to take their
lead from the 'real' economy again after three years of being
tossed about by their own panics and periodic exuberance.
 Since the finance industry flailed into its crisis of
confidence, doubting its own practitioners and the governments
who became over-dependent on them, it has been almost impossible
for households and companies to work out what markets are trying
to predict about production, employment and consumption.
 The net result has been the tail wagging the dog.
Guess the ephemeral mood of global markets six months hence
-- voracious risk appetite or bunker-seeking safety -- and you
might just stand a chance of predicting where businesses,
consumers and policymakers would be forced to follow.
 And while PIMCO asset managers predict a post-crisis 'new
normal' of years of sluggish growth and policy angst, many yearn
for an 'old normal' where finance reflects, rather than
dictates, what is happening in the real economy where people
produce and consume goods and services.
 
 A VERY FINANCIAL COUP
 For some, the credit crisis and aftermath had been fomented
for decades by a more than a doubling of financial services to
some 7.5 percent of the U.S. economy in the 40 years to 2007.
 ""The 3 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) that was made
up of financial services in 1965 was clearly sufficient to the
task, the proof being that the decade was a strong candidate for
the greatest economic decade of the 20th century,"" Jeremy
Grantham, Chairman of Boston-based asset manager GMO, told
clients this month.
 Lauding this month's U.S. financial regulation bill, he
added: ""The extra 4.5 percent would seem to be without material
value except to the recipients. Yet it is a form of tax on the
remaining real economy and should reduce by 4.5 percent a year
its ability to save and invest, both of which did slow down.""
 Former International Monetary Fund chief economist Simon
Johnson's 2009 Atlantic magazine essay, ""The Quiet Coup"", took a
more conspiratorial view of the same phenomenon in sketching the
lobbying power of the financial industry over that period.
 Johnson estimated U.S. financial sector profits, which had
never topped 16 percent of overall corporate profits in the
decade to 1985, soared to 41 percent by the noughties. Average
financial sector compensation as a share of the average in other
industries almost doubled to 181 percent.
 There was a similar development in Britain, where
financial services had reached 8.5 percent of total output just
before the crisis.
 Deregulation, privatisation, trade globalisation and
demographic trends were all catalysts for this growth in finance
and the current regulatory backlash against the banks is
unlikely to return the sector to its 1960s size.
 But if knocking the froth off finance allows a more even
relationship between real economic trends and financial markets,
there may be a chance of tempering the endless boom and busts.
 
 CHANGE AFOOT?
 Is there any sign of that happening right now? Well, just an
inkling.
 In the past three years, financial and investment flows have
been violently herded in and out of ""safe-haven"" cash and liquid
assets, correlations zoomed between all asset classes and
geographic regions, and risk gauges -- largely volatility
measures -- careened from historic lows to highs and back again.
 This mass behaviour had been building for 20 years. Computer
trading strategies supercharged the effect over time.
 Yet as this year's euro zone sovereign debt crisis ebbs into
the second half of the year, the herd seems for now to have
stopped stampeding from its own rifle shots and may be listening
more carefully to the underlying economy again.
 Mindful of near-zero interest rates in cash, an expected
dash back to safe-haven money market funds never really
materialised during the worst of the euro crisis in April and
May and 2010 outflows from these funds are still close to half a
trillion dollars.
 Partly as a result, stresses evident in lock-step asset
correlations have ebbed and investors seem easier with
idiosyncratic trends in selected stocks and credits.
 Equity volatility has halved from April/May peaks and
quartered from post-Lehman Brothers highs in 2008 and is holding
closer to 20-year averages just above 20 percent rather than
returning to unrealistic pre-2007 levels in single digits.
 Even the world's main exchange rates between the U.S. dollar
and euro -- long captive to ""risk on/risk off"" swings -- are
starting to reflect interest rate gaps more than stress.
 For active and diversified investors, this is how it is
supposed to be and allows them to do what it says on the tin.
 To be sure, we've been here before. But there are rays of
hope for some return to old normals.

 ""Volume is really light and today people put a lot on
durable goods,"" said Phil Streible, senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldcock in Chicago.
 He said euro sellers were stepping in at the $1.3000 level
on the euro/dollar and there was little buying interest until
the $1.2750 level.
 ""It takes a lot of buying to hold things up but only little
buying to see it fall,"" Streible said.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro 
traded at $1.2982, down 0.1 percent, with the session peak at
$1.3041 and the session low at $1.2968. Investors are still
looking for news that could push the single currency out of a
recent range after it topped $1.30 for the fifth time this
month on Wednesday.
 The dollar was 0.5 percent lower at 87.48 yen . It
touched a session low at 87.44 yen as a report showed new
orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly
fell for a second straight month in June, their biggest decline
since August. [ID:nN28189480]
 A string of lackluster economic reports recently has
weighed on the greenback. On Friday, the government's first
reading on U.S. second quarter GDP is likely to show growth
slowed in the period amid a cooling in consumer spending and a
wider trade deficit.
 ""The U.S. data now is the main focus in the forex markets,
and it continues to come on the disappointing side,"" said
Amelia Bourdeau, a currency strategist at UBS AG in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 Investors are lacking ""conviction"" and trading in major
currency pairs will be limited to narrow ranges, she said. 
 ""We are past the good news from Europe on the stress tests
and earnings, which helped the euro, and I'm not sure if even
the U.S. GDP report on Friday will be able to break that
pattern,"" Bourdeau said.
 While Friday's report on economic growth is forecast to
mark four straight quarters of growth as the economy digs out
of its longest and deepest recession since the 1930s, the
economy continues to run ""below its long-run growth potential,""
said Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer at Merk
Investments in Palo Alto, California.
 ""It may be hazardous to investors' wealth to think this
path won't be hazardous to the U.S. dollar,"" Merk said.
 EURO/DOLLAR CEILING
 Markets seemed comfortable with euro/dollar around $1.3000,
but investors were still wary of opening up new long euro
positions that would take it much higher, said BNY Mellon's
Michael Woolfolk.
 ""We came a long way this year, from $1.40 to below $1.20 in
the euro, and a lot of that was based on the fear factor. So
the retracement has been merely people taking out a lot of
those short positions,"" he added.
 Woolfolk said it will take a change in risk sentiment to
start a new trend in the pair.
 The euro touched an 11-week high against the dollar at
$1.3045 on Tuesday, helped by strong bank earnings and gains in
European equities, following last week's favorable results of
regulatory stress tests. [ID:nLDE66R1B8]
 Traders said an option barrier at $1.3050 would need to be
taken out for a move toward Fibonacci resistance at $1.3125,
which is a 38.2 percent retracement of the December-June move.
 One-month euro/dollar risk reversal  was last
at -1.60, well off extreme levels in early June, though still
showing a bias to euro puts and dollar calls. A put gives the
option holder the right to sell at a set price while call gives
the holder the right to buy.

 * Prods Japan on beef, EU on genetically modified crops
(Adds quotes from briefing)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative
Ron Kirk urged Japan and the European Union on Wednesday to
remove barriers to U.S. farm products, which he said were
partly to blame for anti-trade sentiment in the United States.
 Kirk also criticized Chinese trade barriers, saying the
Asian manufacturing powerhouse had benefited greatly from open
global markets and had a responsibility to provide others the
""same unfettered access"" it has enjoyed.
 The comments came amid accusations by some countries the
United States has held up a deal in world trade talks because
of protectionist sentiment in Congress.
 ""I tell them the reason we have a difficult domestic
environment is because you're not playing by the rules,"" Kirk
told reporters at a briefing.
 ""If you really want to help change the American domestic
attitude, open up your markets. That's all we're asking anybody
to do,"" Kirk said.
 Japan's restrictions on imports of U.S. beef because of
concerns about mad cow disease and EU regulatory barriers to
genetically modified crops widely grown in the United States
are two longtime irritants.
 ""Japan has basically locked us out of that market for
non-scientific reasons, and it's for the most part because of
political dynamics,"" Kirk said.
 The United States is ""exceptionally frustrated"" that Japan
hasn't agreed to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)
guidelines to reopen its market, Kirk said.
 U.S. Agriculture Department officials have said they hope
to resume talks with Japan on the issue soon.
 EU URGED ON GMO CROPS
 The former Dallas mayor also called on the European Union
to speed up approval of genetically modified crops for sale in
the 27-nation bloc.
 However, he reserved judgment on a new call by the American
Farm Bureau Federation for Washington to begin sanctions
proceedings against the EU in the long-running dispute.
 Kirk said he preferred to solve disputes through ""direct
negotiation, no matter how difficult they are,"" rather than
action at the World Trade Organization.
 The United States will continue working with EU health
chief John Dalli and Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht ""to see
if we can't find a way forward,"" Kirk said.
 In the meantime, Washington has expressed its concerns
about a new European Commission proposal which would allow
individual EU member states to decide whether to allow planting
of GM crops in their territories.
 ""What we want ... is an open transparent process that
conforms with internationally accepted scientific standards and
you're not going to be able to do that if you have members
states all coming up with their own rules,"" Kirk said.
 Turning to China, Kirk said the United States continues to
press Beijing on currency practices and industrial policies
that put U.S. companies at an unfair disadvantage.
 ""We have been absolutely consistent and unyielding in
raising these issues with China,"" Kirk said.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was little

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2010 01:20PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Emerging market capital curbs may be just the ticket," * EM capital controls force change in investor strategies
 * Impact of controls coincides with weak global backdrop
 * Signs speculators moving out of 1-mth Indonesian bonds
 
 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - Investors are buying more
long-dated bonds and overseas-listed shares in key emerging
markets, suggesting capital controls set up in these countries
may be helping curb volatile portfolio flows and currency
swings.
 While it is hard to gauge the net impact of controls set up
in some developing countries, the experience of Brazil and
Indonesia suggests it is possible to deter big speculative flows
or redirect portfolio cash to less volatile assets without
necessarily scaring investors off.
 Last October, frustrated by a 30 percent surge in the real,
Brazil slapped a 2 percent tax on foreign flows into its stocks
and bonds. It was followed by Taiwan, Indonesia and South Korea,
which have imposed a variety of milder curbs on capital.
 Nine months on, investors say they are still putting cash in
Brazil while Finance Minister Guido Mantega has been quoted as
saying that the levy has changed the ""irrational course"" of the
markets and that the real currency is now less volatile.
 Fund managers say the tax has also raised millions of
dollars in government revenue.
 ""Has this tax made my life tougher? Definitely yes. Has it
put me off investing in Brazil? Definitely not,"" said Jose
Cuervo, who looks after $6 billion in Brazilian stocks at HSBC.
 Cuervo says the 2 percent levy has to be seen against the
backdrop of 20 percent-plus corporate earnings growth. 
 To avoid the tax but still invest in Brazil, he buys
American Depositary Receipts in Brazilian firms instead of the
underlying Sao Paulo-listed stocks where possible. ADRs are
priced in dollars and enable investors to sidestep cross-border
and cross-currency transactions.
 The tax has also slowed some cash outflows. 
 ""In the past when we sold positions in local bonds we would
move returns back offshore into dollars. But now we look to keep
the money onshore in Brazil,"" says Brett Diment, who oversees $5
billion in emerging debt at Aberdeen Asset Management.
 Data from Indonesia, another popular emerging market,
suggests steps enacted there in June may have helped push out
some foreign accounts from short-dated debt. 
 Jakarta now requires buyers of one-month central bank bonds
to hold them for at least 28 days, making the short-term debt
less attractive to cut-and-run speculators.
 Foreign holdings of six-month Indonesia bills surged 37
percent in July, data shows. As foreigners raised duration,
one-month yields rose while six-month and one-year yields fell
25-30 bps.
 ""The results are in line with what the government wanted:
more investors in longer-dated bonds, but at the same time
foreign ownership of Indonesian bonds is at a record high,"" said
Standard Chartered currency strategist Thomas Harr.
 
 TOO SUCCESSFUL?
 Ironically, investors fear the relative success of Brazil's
levy may tempt the government to raise it further.
 ""Brazil's local bonds are among the most attractive assets
in EM, but if the real breaks much higher the market will be
concerned about further measures,"" Diment said. 
 ""So from that point of view (the tax) has been a successful
measure in that it is limiting currency appreciation.""
 Some also worry that countries such as Colombia or Peru
could follow Brazil's example.
 The Institute for International Finance has cut its 2010
forecasts for emerging market capital flows, citing fear of more
controls.
 Across emerging markets, flows into equities have dipped
from last year's highs and currencies have weakened, while bond
flows are at record highs. This is significant as equities are
widely seen as a key destination for speculative cash.
 Central bank reserve growth, often used for calculating the
ebb and flow of hot money, has also slowed. Developing
countries' reserves grew $80 billion in the first three months
of 2010, IMF data shows, versus a $200 billion jump the previous
quarter.
 Still, analysts are reluctant to pin these developments
entirely on capital controls, noting that the industrialised
world's poor growth outlook is weighing on emerging markets and
creating a friendlier environment for bonds than stocks.
 ""In the past whenever G3 growth collapsed, flows to EM have
slowed,"" says Claire Dissaux, strategist at Millennium Global
citing 1998 and 2002. ""You would have to believe in true
decoupling to expect flows to continue at the same level.""
 Emerging central banks say it is not currencies or portfolio
flows that they aim to curb, though, but hot money flitting from
market to market in search of yield -- the type of cash that is
widely blamed for past emerging market crises.
 They may be fighting an uphill battle as emerging interest
rates are rising, creating a powerful driver for speculative
capital seeking returns in short-term deposits.
 But multilateral lenders' surprising endorsement of
calibrated controls may be tacit acknowledgement that the curbs
do indeed discourage hot money. 
 A February paper by IMF economists noted ""an effect on the
composition of inflows rather than the aggregate volume""
resulting from such curbs -- just the result the emerging
economies are looking for.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped,
threatening to halt a fifth straight day of gains on
Wednesday, as weak orders for U.S. durable goods in June
cooled the economic outlook and drove the dollar lower.
 New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell
unexpectedly for a second straight month, marking their
largest decline since August, in a fresh sign the economy had
slowed in the second quarter. But some analysts said the
report was respectable after stripping out certain categories.

 Still, the dollar fell versus the Japanese yen as the news

 The Commerce Department said U.S. durable goods orders
fell 1.0 percent in June after a revised 0.8 percent drop in
May. Analysts forecast an increase of 1.0 percent.
 ""Combined with the confidence numbers yesterday, they
don't bode well for continued progress in the economy,"" said
Alan Lancz, president of an investment management firm that
bears his name in Toledo, Ohio. ""It will be more difficult to
break out of the trading range (for stocks) and might be
settling back a little bit.""
 However, Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at
BNY Mellon in New York, said the durable goods report is
always difficult to digest. The number was negative because of
commercial aircraft orders, he said.
 ""If you strip out aircraft and defense, you're left with a
respectable rise of 0.6 percent"" in the important capital
goods category, he said.
 Those orders were up 15.2 percent on a year-on-year

 ""That's consistent with a strong recovery in industrial
production and durable goods orders. So these numbers are not
very concerning,"" Woolfolk said.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> traded

was slightly lower.
 Earnings reports in Europe and Japan supported equity
markets earlier, but the economic data weighed on sentiment
already soured by a Tuesday report that U.S. consumer
confidence in July fell to its lowest since February.
 European stocks ended a one-week rally on the U.S. durable
goods data, which revived worries about the economy and
prompted investors to book some of their recent gains.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
trimmed early gains, slipping 0.31 percent to close at

 With the S&P's 200-day moving average currently around

a recent rally or a consolidation point before further gains.
 U.S. corporate results continued to surprise on the
upside.
 Aircraft maker Boeing Co , defense contractor

No. 3 U.S. oil company, all beat expectations.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2010 12:52PM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-Iran tanker firm NITC not hit by sanctions," * Business as usual for NITC despite Western sanctions
 * NITC storing crude on two tankers at sea
 
 By Jonathan Saul
 LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - Western sanctions against Iran
are not having any impact on the Islamic Republic's biggest
crude oil tanker operator, NITC, which is pressing ahead with
expansion plans, NITC Chairman Mohammad Souri said on Wednesday.
 Western countries suspect Iran's nuclear work is aimed at
bomb-making but Tehran says it is for peaceful purposes.
 New wide-ranging U.S. and European Union sanctions this
month have aimed to squeeze Iran's petroleum imports and
increase its international isolation. The measures have excluded
Iranian crude oil sales.
 Souri told Reuters NITC, which was founded in 1955 and fully
privatised in 2000, was not involved ""in any way"" in the import
of petroleum products into Iran.
 ""It is therefore unaffected by sanctions and remains a
legitimate business partner for companies in the EU and
elsewhere,"" he said in an interview.
 ""We definitely don't want to jeopardise our crude oil
business which is our bread and butter.""
 Iran is the world's fifth-biggest crude oil exporter but
previous U.S. sanctions mean it has suffered from a lack of
investment in refineries, forcing the OPEC member to import some
40 percent of its gasoline needs.
 Souri said over 80 percent of NITC's cargo business derived
from countries outside Iran, including West African and European
nations, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
 ""Foreign clients represent a major part of NITC business
meaning our commercial fortunes are not dependent on Iranian
crude sales,"" he said during a visit to London.
 Souri, who is also NITC's managing director, said there was
no impact on crude sales from Iran as a result of Western
pressure.
 ""If the market feels that sanctions have affected the
selling of crude oil the answer is no, because crude oil is not
part of the sanctions,"" he said.
 ""Western nations are in need of crude oil and if they put
sanctions against crude oil it is against their own interests.""
 
 CRUDE STORAGE
 In recent months Iran has been storing crude oil on tankers
at sea due to a build up in stocks.
 Iran has struggled to sell its crude, which is sour --
meaning it has a high sulphur content -- and which is hard to
shift in summer months when the heating fuel market recedes.
 At its peak in June Iran was estimated to have used up to 25
tankers, mainly very large crude carriers (VLCCs), to store
millions of barrels of crude oil, the highest build up of
Iranian crude at sea since 2008. A VLCC can store up to 2
million barrels of crude oil. 
 A shipping source estimated that 16 VLCCs and a suezmax
tanker, which can hold up to 1 million barrels, were believed to
be storing crude last week.
Souri said the number of NITC tankers engaged in crude
storage ""fluctuates constantly"". He said vessels were being used
to hold condensate -- an ultra-light crude which is especially
valuable to refiners.
 ""If we are talking about the number of NITC tankers at the
moment, it is only two for crude oil. There are a few other
ships for other purposes, that is mainly condensate, and not for
crude oil,"" he said.
 ""These two ships are going to discharge within a week.""
 NITC, which is owned by three Iranian pension funds and was
previously known as the National Iranian Tanker Company, has 42
crude oil tankers in its fleet including 28 VLCCs. It also has
four smaller vessels for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and
bunkering operations.
 Souri said NITC would take delivery of new tankers in the
coming years.
 ""We are expanding at the moment -- we have 23 tankers under
construction in South Korea and China and also 5 tankers under
construction in Iranian shipyards,"" Souri said.
 ""We are not involved in politics and we would like to carry
on our normal business and normal life.""

 * Takes over on week dinar hit new low against euro
 * Experts do not expect major changes

(Adds bank assessment, details)
 By Aleksandar Vasovic
 BELGRADE, July 28 (Reuters) - Serbia's parliament confirmed
academic Dejan Soskic as the new central bank chief on Wednesday
on a six-year term and one his first tasks will be to tackle a
sliding dinar currency after it hit a new record low on Tuesday.
 A university professor who also served as head of the
central bank's supervisory board, Soskic, 43, takes over at a
time of continued weakness for the dinar, prompting a series of
central bank interventions.
 On Tuesday it had sold 90 million euros to banks, one of its
largest interventions of the year, as the dinar hit a record low
against the single currency. It sold another 11 million euros on
Wednesday.
 ""The dinar's fall should not be associated with the
appointment of the governor,"" said Branko Ruzic, whose Socialist
Party is a minority partner in the government. ""I am sure the
central bank leadership will tackle that issue.""
 All 129 deputies voting affirmed Soskic's appointment, but
the opposition refused to vote.
 The parliamentary confirmation comes five months after
predecessor Radovan Jelasic resigned two years ahead of the end
of his term amid political pressure to use currency reserves to
boost spending. 
 ""We do not expect any major shift in the course of the
monetary policy despite the change at the helm,"" Raiffeisen
Research said in a brief review of the issue.
 Analysts and traders say one of Soskic's first tasks will be
the dinar, which traded as low as 106.3 per euro on Wednesday,
close to Tuesday's record low of 106.55 and down from around 76
when the global financial crisis struck in September 2008.
 Jelasic, at a farewell news conference, said exchange rates
were close to levels that could threaten inflation targets.
The central bank set a 2010 inflation target of 4-8 percent.
Inflation now stands at 4.3 percent.
 
 RATE CUTS
In an attempt to help revive the Serbian economy, the
central bank has cut its benchmark interest rate by a total of
almost 10 percentage points since January last year, with the
last cut in May bringing it down to 8 percent.
 Falling rates have contributed to the dinar's fall, which in
turn contributed to deterring investors from buying treasury
bills to finance the budget deficit. It has also made
investments more uncertain.
 In May, the International Monetary Fund and Serbian
government downgraded their forecast for gross domestic product
growth for 2010 to 1.5 percent from 2 percent, after a 3 percent
contraction in 2009.
 Colleagues and former students regard Soskic as a serious,
well-informed professional.
 His appointment follows a new central bank law which
stipulates that an executive board, consisting of the governor
and vice governors, will decide on monetary policy and rates,
handle foreign currency reserves and decide on exchange rate
policy.
 Opposition deputies said that the new law will make Soskic
and the central bank more prone to pressure from Prime Minister
Mirko Cvetkovic's cabinet than his predecessor.
 Parliamentary approval of Soskic's nomination came as a
formality as the ruling pro-European coalition had already
proposed him as the only candidate in April.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell versus the

regional economic conditions, known as the Beige Book, later in
the session. But analysts said the Fed is likely to report
softer economic conditions, which may add to investors' risk
aversion.
 The euro  rose 0.1 percent to $1.3007.
 Markets seemed comfortable with euro/dollar around 1.30,
but investors were still wary of opening up new long euro
positions that would take it much higher, said BNY Mellon's
Michael Woolfolk.
 ""We came a long way this year, from $1.40 to below $1.20 in
the euro, and a lot of that was based on the fear factor. So
the retracement has been merely people taking out a lot of
those short positions,"" he added.
 Woolfolk said it will take a change in risk sentiment to
start a new trend in the pair.
 In late morning trading in New York, the dollar was 0.4
percent lower at 87.48 yen . It touched a session low at
87.44 yen as a report showed new orders for long-lasting U.S.
manufactured goods unexpectedly fell for a second straight
month in June, posting their biggest decline since August.

 A string of lackluster economic reports recently has
weighed on the greenback. And on Friday, the government's first
reading on U.S. second quarter GDP is likely to show growth in
slowed in the period amid a cooling in consumer spending and a
wider trade deficit.
 ""The U.S. data now is the main focus in the forex markets,
and it continues to come on the disappointing side,"" said
Amelia Bourdeau, a currency strategist at UBS AG in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 Investors are lacking ""conviction"" and trading in major
currency pairs will be limited to narrow ranges, she added.
 ""We are past the good news from Europe on the stress tests
and earnings, which helped the euro, and I'm not sure if even
the U.S. GDP report on Friday will be able to break that
pattern,"" Bourdeau said.
 Still, this will mark four straight quarters of growth as
the economy digs out of its longest and deepest recession since
the 1930s.
 The economy continues to run ""below its long-run growth
potential,"" said Axel Merk, president and chief investment
officer at Merk Investments in Palo Alto, California. ""It may
be hazardous to investors' wealth to think this path won't be
hazardous to the U.S. dollar.""
 NARROW RANGE
 The euro touched an 11-week high against the dollar at
$1.3045 on Tuesday, helped by strong bank earnings and gains in
European equities, following last week's favorable results of
regulatory stress tests. [ID:nLDE66R1B8]
 Traders said an option barrier at $1.3050 would need to be
taken out for a move toward Fibonacci resistance at $1.3125,
which is a 38.2 percent retracement of the December-June move.
 Large option expiries were reported by traders at $1.3000
and $1.2850, potentially slowing the euro's gains on the day.
 Elsewhere, the Australian dollar  slid 1 percent to
$0.8918, having dropped from a 11-week high of $0.9069 the
previous day.
 Australian consumer prices rose much less than expected
last quarter, and core inflation slowed to its lowest in more
than three years. [ID:nSGE66P04R]

 LONDON/NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - World stocks dipped,
threatening a fifth straight day of gains on Wednesday as weak
orders for U.S. durable goods damped the economic outlook and
pushed the dollar lower.
 New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell
unexpectedly for a second straight month in June, marking their

cooling in the second quarter. But some analysts said the
report was respectable after stripping out some categories. For

 Oil fell below $77 a barrel after an industry report showed
an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stocks and the durable goods

 The Commerce Department said U.S. durable goods orders fell
1.0 percent in June after a revised 0.8 percent drop in May.
Analysts forecast an increase of 1.0 percent.
 ""Combined with the confidence numbers yesterday, they don't
bode well for continued progress in the economy,"" said Alan

 However, Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at

difficult to digest. The number was negative because of
commercial aircraft orders, he said.
 ""If you strip out aircraft and defense, you're left with a
respectable rise of 0.6 percent"" in the important capital goods

 Those orders were up 15.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.

 * Market eyes oil, stocks, lacks momentum
 * Slight weakening is possible
(Adds comments, quotes, updates prices)
 MOSCOW, July 28 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble held its
ground on Wednesday, hovering near a 10-week peak versus the
dollar, but dealers said it might trim recent gains as support
from a local tax period waned.
 The rouble gave up 6 kopecks against the dollar, or 0.2
percent, to 30.26  -- just below a 10-week high of
30.19 hit in early trade.
 Against the euro, the rouble was virtually unchanged at
39.30 .
 Oil prices -- the rouble's main benchmark -- bolstered
Russian asset values despite falling below $76 a barrel [O/R].
Such price levels are still considered enough to ensure inflows
into Russia's economy.
 The rouble has been supported for several days by Russian
exporters swapping dollar and euro revenues to meet month and
quarter-end domestic tax payments.
 The last payment of income taxes, due by Wednesday, may have
totalled 240-270 billion roubles ($7.9-8.9 billion), according
to Trust bank estimates.
 ""Lower oil prices and some risk aversion may prompt
investors to keep away from the rouble. We saw exporters selling
(foreign currencies) but not much more than usual,"" said Andrey
Mishko, a dealer at Nomos bank.
 Tax payments affected the Russian money market where
overnight interbank interest rates  were peaking above
3.0 percent compared to around 2.5 percent seen last week.
 
 NO CLEAR MOOD 
 Against the euro-dollar basket, the rouble was down 5
kopecks at 34.33 , remaining in the zone of the central
bank's interventions, which buys some $150 million a day in the
range of 33.40-34.40 to ease upward pressure on the rouble,
dealers say.
 Dealers said the market was eyeing developments in U.S.
stocks that might take their toll on oil prices and commodity
currencies like the rouble.
 ""There is no speculative mood, no clear understanding of the
further direction. There are no reasons to break through the
level of 34.30 (roubles per basket) but if oil climbs to $80,
the downside pressure (on the basket) will mount,"" said
Stanislav Yarushevichus, chief dealer at ING bank in Moscow.
Analysts at Renaissance Capital said in a note to clients
the rouble was likely to stay within its recent trading range of
34.20-34.40 in terms of the basket in coming days.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2010 11:16AM ET</span>",EU considers big tariff cuts to help manufacturers," * EU Commission considers suspending tariffs on 92 products
 * Multi-year suspension designed to help manufacturers
 * Preliminary list includes pig iron, chemicals, woods
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, July 28 (Reuters) - European Union countries are
in a deepening dispute over an Italian proposal to temporarily
drop import tariffs on dozens of raw industrial goods, a move
supposed to help EU manufacturers weather the economic crisis.
 The Italian proposal was put to the European Commission, the
EU's executive, several months ago, prompting the Commission to
ask other EU member states for their input. 
 As a result, the Commission has now compiled a list of 92
products from which tariffs could be cut, sparking a row between
member states who support the move and those who say doing so
would damage their own manufacturing industries.
 The Commission's list, seen by Reuters, covers products in
the steel, cosmetics, shoemaking, textile, furniture and
car-manufacturing industries, among others.
 Italy, which has a large manufacturing base that imports raw
materials from the likes of China, Brazil and Russia, using them
to produce higher-value goods, estimates savings for EU firms of
2 billion euros ($2.6 bln) a year if the tariffs are cut.
 But diplomats say France, Germany and Spain -- three of the
EU's largest economies -- oppose the proposal, which could have
a severe impact on their own manufacturers, who produce many of
the same goods that Italy and others are importing.
 Italy is supported by the Czech Republic and also has
backing from free-trade advocates such as Britain, the
Netherlands and Sweden. The proposal would eliminate or at least
sharply reduce tariffs for two to three years.
 ""This will allow European companies to buy materials at the
same prices as their competitors,"" said Giancarlo Salemi, a
spokesman for Italy's deputy minister for economic development,
Adolfo Urso.
 ""In this financial crisis, it will be a help to companies
who need to buy things, and to consumers as well.""
 
 TRADE BATTLE
 The proposal echoes moves by the U.S. Congress, which this
month voted on a bill proposing tariff cuts on industrial
inputs. Brazil and Canada are considering similar moves.
 Specifically, the Commission list covers chemicals and
mineral ingredients used in food processing, pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics, microchips and packaging; elements used in steel and
car production; sheep, cow, pig, horse and other hides to be
made into leather; dozens of exotic woods, pig iron, aluminium
and 26 types of yarns and fabrics.
 Reducing or eliminating tariffs on such products -- which
remains only a possibility at this point -- could raise alarm
bells in developing countries about so-called tariff escalation,
where raw materials enter a country or region at low rates but
higher-value processed goods are subjected to higher tariffs.
 It could also lead to retaliatory measures by developing
world exporters as they seek to maintain competitive advantage.
 The Commission, which can either reject Italy's proposal or
put forward a proposal of its own, has told EU governments that
a comprehensive deal may not be possible unless member states
can agree compromises themselves, diplomats say.
 If a majority of the 27 member states support a
tariff-reduction plan, the Commission could make a proposal this
autumn, which national governments would then vote on.
 Italy and other advocates of the cuts are expected to use
the summer to apply what pressure they can on France and Germany
to support the proposals, but it remains far from clear that a
compromise will be reached, meaning a stand-off is likely.

 * Top-down approach still keeping Hungarian assets afloat
 * IMF debt payback will force more supply and raise yields
 * Potential downgrade, rate hikes also pose risks
 By Michael Winfrey and Marton Dunai
 PRAGUE/BUDAPEST, July 28 (Reuters) - Hungarian assets have
mostly held their ground during the new government's standoff
with the IMF -- and that leaves plenty of scope for a bigger
selloff if official resistance to an IMF deal persists.
 Since talks broke down between the government and the
International Monetary Fund on July 17, the forint has surprised
market watchers by recovering from a 3 percent drop. Debt yields
have risen but avoided a Greece-like spiral higher.
 But data shows there has been a big outflow of foreign
portfolio investment since Prime Minister Viktor Orban's huge
April 25 election win, and investors say that will continue if
the Fidesz government sticks to its current path.
 If Hungarian media and political pundits are correct, the
government's resistance to agreeing a new standby deal with the
IMF is not just a negotiating tactic, designed to put off tough
decisions until after Oct. 3 municipal elections.
 Instead, Fidesz may prove to be wedded to a pro-growth,
anti-austerity policy in which it sees no need for the IMF.
 And if the government still won't compromise after Oct. 3,
bond investors would demand higher premiums because Hungary, now
without a safety net, would have to issue more debt to start
paying back its original 20 billion euro ($26 billion)
IMF/European Union bailout.
 There is also the threat of rating downgrades as the
government signals it will overshoot its 2011 EU budget
commitments, while the central bank has said it might hike rates
if risk premiums remain high. Either scenario would drive yields
higher, raising Hungary's borrowing costs and potentially
hitting the forint.
 ""The fact that the IMF is gone means Hungary will have to
start paying back its emergency loan, which will result in extra
debt supply and inevitable higher yields,"" said Daniel Bebesy, a
fund manager at Budapest Fund Management.
 ""That will be the single strongest force driving yields up.""
The forint, which fell sharply against the euro following
the collapse of IMF talks, has since clawed back to near its
previous levels and was trading at 282.75 per euro on Wednesday.
 It has given up 6.8 percent against the euro since the April
election, versus a loss of 2.7 percent on the Polish zloty and a
1.4 percent rise on the Czech crown.
 
 OUTLFOW
 According to fund tracker EPFR Global, investment funds
ploughed $3.745 billion into emerging market equities and bonds
in the week ending July 14, which analysts said helped stabilise
the forint and staunch losses in other Hungarian assets.
 Strategists also said some investors see Hungarian equities
as cheap, and although funds see the country's economic risks,
they are still hard pressed to put money to work in the region.
 Many assume Budapest will return to talks with the IMF.
 ""That is why we are still seeing inflows into Hungary,"" said
Koon Chow, a strategist at Barclay's Capital. ""But the risks are
high that you won't get the IMF programme.""
 If that scenario unfolds, it could prompt potential ratings
downgrades and an investor stampede.
 The cost of funding Hungary's 12-month government debt
jumped 32 basis points after the July 17 collapse of the IMF
talks. Levels have since stabilised, with a 3-month treasury
bill tender showing a slightly lower yield on Tuesday.
 But the overall trend shows a significant outflow of funds
since Fidesz took the biggest parliamentary majority in the
country's post-communist history in the April election.
 Reuters data shows foreign holdings of Hungarian local state
bonds have fallen 175.46 billion forints ($788.9 million) to
2,198.63 billion since April 30, an 8 percent drop.
 Foreign investment fund holdings in equities also show net
outflow of $29.65 million since April 29, according to EPFR, a
reversal from the pre-election inflow of $93.91 million.
 ""The decline in foreign-held debt stock is pretty shocking,""
said fund manager Gabor Orban, of Hungary's Aegon. ""Even as
there is a healthy inflow into dedicated local currency emerging
market bond funds, those funds are not reaching Hungary.""
 
 RATE HIKES, DOWNGRADES
 Hungary will have to pay back 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion)
of EU aid money next year, plus another 2 billion euros worth of
FX-denominated bonds coming due and 1.316 trillion forints ($5.9
billion) in local currency debt.
 No fund manager would estimate where yields could go, but
they all saw big risks.
 Moody's and Standard & Poor's have put Budapest on watch for
possible downgrade. A cut by the latter would put Hungary in
speculative grade, which could drive away funds that can hold
only investment grade assets.
 ""There is no hot money inflow and there are no new buy and
hold investors coming either,"" said Gergely Forian Szabo, a fund
manager at Pioneer Fund Management. 
 ""Not until there are foreign investors will there be
liquidity, but not until there is liquidity will foreign
investors dip their toes in this water. It's a vicious circle.""

 By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, July 28 (Reuters) - Hungary's prime minister said
on Wednesday that one or two downgrades of the country's credit
rating were likely after it broke ties with the IMF, but he said
its finances were stable and the government should focus on
growth.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who confounded financial
investors less than two weeks ago by halting talks with Hungary's
international lenders, made it clear that his centre-right
government would prioritise growth over budget austerity.
 Orban reiterated that Hungary was strong enough to finance
itself from the markets without a renewed deal with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which together with the EU
rescued Hungary from financial meltdown in October 2008.
[ID:nLDE66P0GE]
 The current IMF deal expires in October, and the government
had wanted to seek a new safety net-type deal for 2011-2012,
according to an earlier plan revealed by the economy minister
before the talks with lenders fell through. [ID:nLDE6610H3]
 Two ratings agencies signalled last Friday that they could
cut Hungary's rating after the government called a halt to talks
on a review of its $25 billion aid deal with the IMF and
signalled it did not want to renew its agreement.
 Investors sold Hungarian assets in response, although some
analysts say the government's argument against IMF budget cut
demands is reasonable. Analysts have also said that Orban's
Fidesz party might still come back to the table after October
local elections which Fidesz wants to win by a big margin.
 ""The country's financial situation is stable and predictable
and it gives good hope for us to continue with structural
changes and also restart the economy's growth,"" Orban told a
business conference on Wednesday.
 Orban has said the government will meet this year's 3.8
percent of GDP deficit goal, specified in the current IMF deal,
but will allow the deal to expire in October.
 ""Let us also look at the suspension of IMF talks and the
subsequent qualifications and downgrades, of which we can still
expect one or two ... There will still be one or two downgrades
but these will not cause special disturbances,"" Orban said.
 ""Clearly these are not pleasant things, but they cause only
temporary (market) turmoil, after which both the forint's
exchange rate and the country's bond issuances and sales ...
return to levels where the country's operation can be considered
normal. So going ahead with this policy makes sense.""
 The forint  fell more than 3 percent last Monday
after talks with lenders were halted, but it has recovered since
then, and it did not react to Orban's comments.
 ""I think overall, given a lack of market reaction to what
happened, he (Orban) has been emboldened and he is going to push
markets, EU and IMF as far as he can go,"" said Peter Attard
Montalto at Nomura in London.
 ""Everyone is now on holiday, but I think we will see the
rating agencies, IMF and EU all pushing back into late August.""

 BOOSTING THE ECONOMY
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said at the same business
forum that Hungary needed to boost economic growth to achieve a
sustainable fiscal balance -- and not the other way round. 
 The new government, which took power in May, says it wants
to break with a failed policy of recent years that made
achieving a fiscal balance a priority on the view that a
balanced budget would generate economic growth later on.
 ""We say we need to sit on the horse the other way around ...
we need to invest cleverly. Then jobs are created, from which
stems growth and the result will be (fiscal) balance,"" Matolcsy
said.
 He said the government would launch a 20-year development
plan that would create a million jobs in the first decade.
 He said the plan aims to devote mainly EU funds to key areas
such as the health industry, real estate development, green
projects and small and medium-sized businesses.
 Orban's government has refused to accept demands from its
international lenders to back down on a new tax on financial
institutions in 2011 that the government says will enable it to
plug budget holes this year and next.
 Orban, who is looking for more fiscal room to manoeuvre next
year, also said on Wednesday that Hungary needed to produce the
most transparent budget in Europe.
 He wants a ""uniform European agreement"" that would give all
countries under the Excessive Deficit Procedure, including
Hungary, the same timeframe to cut their deficits to the
required 3 percent level. Hungary has to cut its deficit below 3
percent next year under current rules.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - The dollar fell versus the
Japanese yen on Wednesday as a weaker-than-expected reading on
new orders for U.S. durable goods added to fears about the U.S.
economic outlook.
 Demand for the dollar also rose against the euro as a rally
in the single currency stalled and investors awaited the
release of the Federal Reserve's reading on regional economic
conditions, known as the Beige Book, later in the session.
 Analysts said the Fed is likely to report softer economic
conditions, which may add to investors' overall risk aversion.
 ""The U.S. data now is the main focus in the forex markets,
and it continues to come on the disappointing side,"" said
Amelia Bourdeau, a currency strategist at UBS AG in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 Investors are lacking ""conviction"" and trading in major
currency pairs will be limited to narrow ranges, she added.
 ""We are past the good news from Europe on the stress tests
and earnings, which helped the euro, and I'm not sure if even
the U.S. GDP report on Friday will be able to break that
pattern,"" Bourdeau said.
 In morning trading in New York, the dollar was 0.3 percent
lower at 87.61 yen. It touched a session low at 87.48 yen after
a report showed new orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured
goods unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in June,
posting their biggest decline since August.
 The euro also fell after the report to trade 0.1 percent
lower at $1.2979. The single currency touched an 11-week high
against the dollar at $1.3045 on Tuesday, helped by strong bank
earnings and gains in European equities, following last week's
favorable results of regulatory stress tests.
 Markets seemed comfortable with euro/dollar around 1.30,
but investors were still wary of opening up new long euro
positions that would take it much higher, said BNY Mellon's
Michael Woolfolk.
 ""We came a long way this year, from $1.40 to below $1.20 in
the euro, and a lot of that was based on the fear factor. So
the retracement has been merely people taking out a lot of
those short positions,"" he added.
 Woolfolk said it will take a change in risk sentiment to
start a new trend in the pair.
 Traders said an option barrier at $1.3050 would need to be
taken out for a move toward Fibonacci resistance at $1.3125,
which is a 38.2 percent retracement of the December-June move.
 Large option expiries were reported by traders at $1.3000
and $1.2850, potentially slowing the euro's gains on the day.
 Elsewhere, the Australian dollar slid 0.9 percent to
$0.8934, having dropped from a 11-week high of $0.9069 the
previous day.
 Australian consumer prices rose much less than expected
last quarter, and core inflation slowed to its lowest in more
than three years.

 JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Reuters) - As many as 900,000 South
African public sector workers are likely to strike in a week to
push for higher wages, a group of unions said on Wednesday.
 ""Every government department will be affected,"" said Fikile
Majola, head of the NEHAWU public sector union, reading a

organisations.
 State workers including nurses, teachers, police, customs
officials and immigration officers rejected a 6.5 percent

 By Aseel Kami
 BAGHDAD, July 28 (Reuters) - Worried about bombs and suicide
attacks? Iraq has the solution for businessmen who want to
invest but fear venturing into Baghdad's dangerous streets --
work and live in a mini-city right next to the airport.
 The major oil exporter has been struggling to attract
much-needed investment to develop its infrastructure after years
of militant bloodshed, under-investment and sanctions as many
firms wait for security to improve.
 Overall violence has dropped significantly in Iraq since the
height of sectarian warfare in 2006-07. But bombings and
shootings are still occur regularly in Baghdad and elsewhere.
 While Iraq has signed eleven deals with global oil companies
to develop its richest fields, projects outside the energy
sector have rarely gone beyond aspirations. Lingering violence
and political uncertainty, four months after an inconclusive
election, are keeping most western investors on the sidelines.
To persuade more investors to come, an Iraqi firm is
planning to build a ""village of businesses"" next to Baghdad
airport, a 30-minute drive from the city centre, according to
Shaker al-Zamili, head of the Baghdad Investment Commission.
 The mini-city will offer all amenities for businessmen to
strike deals, showcase their products and chill out at night --
offices, hotels and apartments, banks, 119 shops, a petrol
station, a car rental agency and even duty-free shops. And there
will be restaurants, internet cafes and parks.
 The area, scheduled for completion in 3-5 years for $250
million, will also house offices of state investment commissions
and branches of most government ministries to help investors.
 ""When a company comes to Iraq, instead of wandering, it
could stay and deal with officials and get any information, any
details it wants while staying there,"" Zamili said on Wednesday.
 Companies also could rent places for displaying products and
services, he added.
 Of those brave enough to invest in Iraq despite violence so
far, Iranian, Turkish and Gulf companies lead the pack,
especially in Shi'ite tourism, housing and banking.
 The United Arab Emirates is the biggest investor in large
projects, with total pledges of $37.7 billion, while Lebanon
tops the list of investment deals below $1 billion, according to
a report last year by Dunia Frontier Consultants.

visit

 (Adds reaction from Pakistani spokesman, other details)
 By Estelle Shirbon and Bappa Majumdar
 NEW DELHI, July 28 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron trumpeted a $1.1 billion defence deal with India on
Wednesday, an early result of a big diplomatic push to court
Indian business and tap new sources of economic growth.
 In comments likely to please New Delhi and upset Islamabad,
Cameron said India's arch rival Pakistan should not ""promote
the export of terror"". That comes days after a huge leak of
U.S. documents raised questions about Pakistan's role in
Afghanistan and its support for the Taliban.
 On his first visit to India since taking office in May,
Cameron took six ministers and more than 30 senior executives
from top UK firms with him, to show Britain is serious about
boosting economic exchanges with Asia's third-largest economy.
 BAE Systems, Europe's biggest defence contractor, and
engine maker Rolls-Royce were early winners. They signed a deal
worth about $1.1 billion with a state-run Indian firm to supply
57 Hawk trainer jets to India, one of the world's biggest
defence markets.
 While Cameron toured Bangalore, his finance minister George
Osborne was in Mumbai to persuade to free up its financial
services market and hasten the signing of a free trade deal
between India and the European Union.
 Sources in Cameron's entourage also said London had decided
to start granting licences to its civil nuclear firms to export
to India, opening up prospects of deals potentially worth
billions. The move follows in Washington's lead and is intended
to build trust with India to help business ties.
 ""I want this to be a relationship which drives economic
growth upwards and drives our unemployment figures downwards,""
Cameron said in a speech to young Indian business leaders at
the high-tech Infosys campus in Bangalore.
 ""This is a trade mission, yes, but I prefer to see it as my
job's mission,"" he said.
 India, a former British colony, belongs to the ""BRIC"" group
of rapidly growing emerging economies along with China, Brazil
and Russia, the likes of which Britain is hoping to tap as it
seeks to offset drastic public spending cuts at home.
 Cameron has often lamented that Britain trades more with
Ireland than it does with all the BRICs combined and he has
vowed to remedy that with vigorous pro-trade diplomacy.
 PAKISTAN WARNING
 Cameron said on Wednesday that Pakistan must not become a
base for militants and ""promote the export of terror"" across
the globe, saying their bilateral ties depended on that.
 The remarks are likely to cheer officials in New Delhi,
which has long accused its neighbour of backing strikes on
Indian targets including the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
 ""We cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country
is allowed to look both ways and is able, in any way, to
promote the export of terror, whether to India or whether to
Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world,"" he said.
 Pakistani officials dismissed the comments, with foreign
ministry spokesman Abdul Basit telling the BBC that there was
""no question of Pakistan looking the other way"" and accusing
Cameron of heeding leaked documents that were ""unverifiable"".
 In an interview on India's NDTV later, Cameron toned down
his comments, saying that ""it's unacceptable for anything to
happen within Pakistan that is about the promotion of terror"".
 Cameron leads the biggest trade delegation in modern times
to India as a statement of intent amid talk of Britain wanting
to forge a ""special relationship"" with India -- a phrase more
closely associated with Britain's ties with Washington.
 Cameron's Conservative-led government, and some Indian
commentators, think its Labour predecessor did too little to
maintain ties with India, the world's second most populous
nation with 1.2 billion potential customers.
 The Indian response to the British overture was guarded.
 ""We have seen reports and are aware of the intention of the
government of UK to have a new special relationship with
India,"" T.P. Sitaraman, the joint secretary at India's foreign
ministry, told reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday.
 ""The discussions will naturally throw light on what those
terms mean.""

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2010 07:44AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-EU approves six GM maize varieties for import," * Approvals cover imports for use in food, animal feed
 * Decision a sign of EU exec's resolve to speed GM approvals
 
 (Adds details, background)
 BRUSSELS, July 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission on
Wednesday approved six genetically modified (GM) maize varieties
for import to the bloc in a sign of its desire to speed up
European Union decisions on the controversial technology.
 The EU's executive granted the approvals unilaterally after
EU farm ministers failed to reach a decision on the applications
in June. The approvals, which are valid for 10 years, cover
imports for food and animal feed, not for cultivation.
 ""The six adoptions of today are the result of a usual and
standard procedure concerning the authorisation of GMOs to be
used in food and feed and have no link with the recently adopted
package on cultivation,"" the Commission said in a statement.
 Last month the Commission proposed an overhaul of the bloc's
rules on GM cultivation, which if approved would allow member
states to decide whether to grow or ban GM crops in their
territories.
 The proposals followed a political commitment from
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso last year to give
member states greater power on cultivation decisions, a bid to
break a deadlock between EU governments on GM approvals.
 Many will see the Commission's approval, just one month
after governments failed to reach accord, as evidence of the
executive's determination to speed up GM decision-making.
 
 TRADE CONCERNS EASED
 The decisions open the way for fresh imports of the approved
GM maize varieties from countries such as the United States,
Brazil and Argentina.
 In June the Commission told EU governments that failure to
approve the varieties could lead to a repeat of last year's
disruption to animal feed imports.
 That was caused by the EU's zero-tolerance policy on
unapproved GM material in imports. Shipments of animal feed from
the US were refused entry to the bloc after minute traces of
unapproved GM material were discovered in the cargo.
 The Commission has said it will propose a small tolerance
margin for unapproved GM in imports later this year to resolve
the issue, but until then the only solution is for the EU to
approve varieties individually for import.
 One of the decisions renewed a previous EU approval for the
insect-resistant Bt11 maize -- developed by Swiss-based biotech
company Syngenta -- which expired in 2007.
 The other five covered new approvals for soc-called
""stacked"" maize varieties, developed by combining existing
insect- and herbicide-resistant GM maize varieties together with
using conventional plant breeding techniques.
 One of the five was also developed by Syngenta; two were
developed jointly by subsidiaries of U.S. chemical companies
DuPont and Dow Chemical; and a further two were developed by
Monsanto.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - The euro struck a two-month high
against the yen and stayed within reach of an 11-week high
against the dollar on Wednesday, underpinned by robust European
bank earnings and solid economic data.
 But analysts said the durability of any recovery in Europe
was questionable.
 Risk sentiment had been boosted on Tuesday as European
shares hit a five-week closing high. Two of Europe's top banks,
UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG, posted results that reassured
investors following last week's regulatory stress tests.
 A rise in German consumer sentiment on Tuesday, following on
from a strong Ifo and PMI surveys the previous week, had also
boosted European recovery hopes.
 ""Clearly there's a risk-on situation as the market is
starting to believe there's a European recovery in place, but
there is thin liquidity behind it,"" said Neil Mellor, currency
strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
 ""We have doubts over the recovery, particularly as the U.S.
economy continues to struggle,"" he said.
 Asian equity markets closed with strong gains, as Japan's
Nikkei 225 Index and China's Shanghai Stock Exchange both jumped
more than 2 percent on Wednesday, but European markets struggled
to gain momentum.
 ""The market is more relaxed but it is starting to question
the improvement we have seen in risk appetite over recent days.
There are still potential headwinds in Europe from austerity
measures, possible haircuts or even sovereign defaults,"" said
Jane Foley, research director at Forex.com.
 At 1010 GMT, the euro was trading close to flat versus the
yen at 114.24, easing from a two-month high hit in early
European dealing at 114.74 on trading platform EBS.
 Technical analysts said the picture was bullish, as euro/yen
continued to make gains within its Ichimoku cloud. The top of
the cloud was seen as key resistance at 117.86.
 The euro stayed within touching distance of an 11-week high
against the dollar of $1.3045 hit the previous day, hovering
around $1.3000.
 Traders said an option barrier at $1.3050 would need to be
taken out for a move towards Fibonacci resistance at $1.3125,
which is a 38.2 percent retracement of the December-June move.
 Large option expiries were reported by traders at $1.3000
and $1.2850, potentially slowing the euro's gains on the day.
 
 AUSSIE HURT BY CPI DATA
 Key euro interbank lending rates continued to rise on
Wednesday amid expectations banks would continue scaling back
use of ECB loans.
 The ECB allotted 23 billion euros in a three-month tender
operation, down from the previous month's allocation of 131.9
billion.
 ""Euribor continues to tick higher and the ECB's Trichet
appears to be content for that to happen judging by recent
comments,"" said Foley at Forex.com, referring to ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet.
 The Australian dollar slid 0.7 percent to $0.8949, having
dropped from a 11-week high of $0.9069 reached the previous day.
 Australian consumer prices rose much less than expected last
quarter and core inflation slowed to its lowest in more than
three years, ruling out the need for a rate rise next week and
possibly the rest of the year.

 * Passenger demand up 11.9 percent
(Adds details, quotes, background)
 GENEVA, July 28 (Reuters) - Air cargo demand jumped by more
than a quarter in June compared with a year ago and passenger
numbers rose more than one tenth as airlines saw a growing
recovery from the economic crisis, industry figures showed.
 While the recovery is faster than expected, there are sharp
regional differences, with all regions except Europe reporting
double-digit increases in passenger traffic, airlines industry
body IATA said on Wednesday.
 International freight traffic in June was 26.5 percent
higher than a year earlier and passenger demand rose 11.9
percent, according to a monthly report from IATA, the
International Air Transport Association.
 IATA Director-General Giovanni Bisignani said these
double-digit growth rates were unlikely to be maintained.
 ""Business confidence remains high and there is no indication
that the recovery will stall any time soon. But with government
stimulus packages tailing off and restocking largely completed,
we do expect some slowing over the months ahead,"" he said.
 Passenger volumes are now 1-2 percent above their
pre-recession peak in the first quarter of 2008, IATA said.
 The data are a leading indicator of trade and the overall
global economy. IATA estimates that some 30 percent of world
trade by value -- more expensive goods rather than bulk cargos
-- are moved by air.
The data also confirm a recent forecast that the industry is
returning to profitability.
 IATA, whose 230 members include Lufthansa and Singapore
Airlines, said on July 20 that almost 70 percent of members
surveyed had made money in the last quarter and a similar
proportion expect further improvement over the year ahead.
 IATA revised its own forecast for 2010 industry financial
performance to a profit of $2.5 billion from a loss of $2.8
billion.
 Airline capacity increased slightly above demand in June,
keeping load factors -- an industry measure of capacity usage --
close to historical highs at 79.8 percent for passenger traffic
and 53.8 percent for freight.
 Bisignani said that orders for more than 400 new aircraft at
the Farnborough Air Show were a sign of growing confidence, but
would make it harder to match capacity with demand.

 By Estelle Shirbon
 BANGALORE, July 28 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron tried to persuade India on Wednesday to do more business
with Britain as he seeks new sources of economic growth to
offset deep cuts in public spending at home.
 On his first visit to India since taking office in May,
Cameron leads a delegation including six ministers and more than
30 senior executives from top UK firms, to show that Britain is
serious about boosting economic exchanges with the Asian giant.
 ""I want this to be a relationship which drives economic
growth upwards and drives our unemployment figures downwards,""
he said in a speech to young Indian business leaders at the
high-tech Infosys campus in Bangalore.
 ""This is a trade mission, yes, but I prefer to see it as my
jobs mission,"" he said.
 India, a former British colony, belongs to the ""BRIC"" group
of rapidly growing emerging economies along with China, Brazil
and Russia. Cameron has often lamented that Britain trades more
with Ireland than it does with all the BRICs combined and he has
vowed to remedy that with vigorous pro-trade diplomacy.
 Among the executives on Cameron's plane is Richard Olver,
chairman of defence group BAE Systems, who will return home with
a contract potentially worth $775 million to supply 57 Hawk
training jets to India's air force and navy.
 A senior air force official told Reuters in New Delhi that
the contract between BAE and state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd
would be signed in Bangalore on Wednesday.
 Other business leaders visiting India as part of the British
delegation include the CEOs of banking giant Barclays,
infrastructure group Balfour Beatty, insurance firm Aviva and
private equity firm 3i.
 One industry that stands to benefit from Britain's increased
economic focus on India is the civil nuclear sector. 
 British government sources told reporters in Bangalore that
London would start granting licences to its civil nuclear firms
to export to India, opening up business prospects potentially
worth billions of pounds.
 
 ""VESTED INTERESTS""
 Cameron's coalition government says the British economy is
too dependent on the public sector. It plans to cut public
spending to reduce the budget deficit, which has swollen to a
peacetime record, but critics say this will worsen unemployment.
 The coalition says private businesses should be the engine
of growth, and one of its strategies is to focus diplomatic
efforts on fast-growing emerging markets to promote trade. On
his way to India, Cameron visited Turkey on a similar mission.
 ""In Britain, we're waking up to a new reality,"" he wrote in
a column in Wednesday's edition of the Hindu newspaper.
""Economic power is shifting -- particularly to Asia -- so
Britain has to work harder than ever before to earn its living
in the world. I'm not ashamed to say that's one of the reasons
why I'm here in India.""
 In his speech in Bangalore, he challenged India to ""take on
vested interests"" and further open up its markets.
 ""We want you to reduce the barriers to foreign investment in
banking, insurance, defence manufacturing and legal services --
so that we can both reap the benefits,"" he said.
 With the World Trade Organisation's Doha round of
multilateral talks making little progress, Britain sees a free
trade deal between the European Union and India as the next big
step forward. Cameron said he was determined that such a deal
should be reached before the end of the year.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for the fifth
session in a row on Wednesday, supported by solid corporate
earnings but held back from greater gains by concerns over U.S.
economic weakness.
 Wall Street looked set for a flat to weak open. The dollar
recovered earlier losses to trade flat against a basket of major
currencies.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.3
percent against the previous close and the Thomson Reuters

 The positive earnings sentiment was vying with concerns

on Tuesday. Home prices rose in May, but labour-market worries
took July consumer confidence to its lowest since February.
 U.S. financial services firm State Street suggested on
Tuesday, however, that confidence among institutional investors
was rising across the board and that good valuations were
attracting them back into equities.
 
 EURO REBOUND
 The euro hit a two-month high against the yen before
slipping back a bit and was generally firm against the dollar as
recent signs of resilience in the euro zone economy and solid
bank earnings brought out buyers.
 Against the dollar, the euro was up 0.1 percent at

since mid-April.
 Near-term resistance for the euro is seen at the May 10 high
of $1.3095, followed by $1.3125, which is a 38.2 percent
retracement of the December-June move.
 ""The euro has been rising on short-covering until recently.
But it will probably need new factors to keep its uptrend going,
which I don't see now,"" said Etsuko Yamashita, chief strategist
at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
 But a number of commentators see more upside, based on the
resilience of the euro zone economy. On the other hand, doubts
remain over the ability of the U.S. economy to avoid a slowdown.
 Chartists say a sustained break above the $1.30 level could
place the euro in a new $1.30-$1.35 trading range in the coming
weeks.
 ""The euro continues to flutter about $1.30, while levels such
as $1.3094 loom large as thresholds that would spark further
unwinding of euro short positions,"" David Watt, RBC Capital
Markets senior strategist, wrote in a note.
 Against the yen, the euro dipped 0.2 percent to 114.00 yen,
staying within sight of a two-month high of 114.42 yen struck on
Tuesday.
 Traders said the euro looked increasingly bullish on charts
against the yen, especially after it rose above 113.50 yen where
it met lots of offers from Japanese exporters.
 The euro is seen facing resistance in the 114.10-114.40 yen
region, the neckline of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern the
pair is about to form after hitting an 8-½ year low of 107.30
yen in late June, traders said.
 The euro could extend its rally to the key psychological 120
yen level if it clearly breaks above that resistance, they said.
 AUSSIE SLIDES AS CPI REMOVES RATE RISK
 The Australian dollar slid 0.8 percent to $0.8934, having
dropped from a 11-week high of $0.9069 reached the previous day.
 Australian consumer prices rose much less than expected last
quarter while core inflation slowed to it lowest in over three
years, greatly lessening the possibility of the Reserve Bank of
Australia raising interest rates -- now at 4.5 percent -- at its
monthly meeting on Aug. 3.
 ""The Aussie has given back some of its recent gains as CPI
data prompted investors to push back expectations for higher
rates,"" said Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Trust &
Banking.
 ""But the Aussie is likely to keep drawing support from
Australian interest rates, which are still the highest among
industrialised countries.""
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 87.71 yen, with patchy U.S.
data continuing to weigh on the greenback.
 U.S. consumer confidence for July fell to its lowest level
since February, and eyes are on consumer durable goods numbers
for June due later in the session to further gauge the health of
the world's largest economy.
 The dollar index was little changed at 82.14, with near-term
support at 81.44, a 50 percent retracement of the index's move
from a low of 74.17 in December 2009 to a high of 88.71 on June
7.

 * BOJ Kamezaki: central bank proactive on beating deflation
 * Cautious on impact of euro fall on Japanese firms
 * Economists say forex levels could become factor in policy
 * But remarks don't suggest immediate action - analyst
(Recasts, adds details)
 By Rie Ishiguro
 SAPPORO, Japan, July 28 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will
not decide policy with specific foreign exchange levels in mind,
a board member said, but some analysts said it could eventually
take token steps to slow the yen's rise if it surged.
 BOJ policy board member Hidetoshi Kamezaki said on Wednesday
that Japan's economic recovery lacked strength and could stall
temporarily in the fourth quarter, as export growth was likely to
moderate and government stimulus steps were set to expire.
 Kamezaki also said euro weakness against the yen could affect
firms' export competitiveness, which could hurt the economy.
 Economists said his remarks did not herald immediate action
from the central bank, although some said the BOJ could increase
its comments on currencies or even try to steer short-term
interest rates lower if the dollar fell below 85 yen and there
were signs of a double-dip in the global economy.
 The dollar stood at 88.00 yen on Wednesday.
 ""Japan's exports are weaker than what we have seen in other
major Asian exporters because they are experiencing some drag
from the yen,"" said David Cohen, director of Asian economic
forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore.
 ""It would be awkward for the Japanese to intervene while
there is pressure on China's yuan, but there might be verbal
intervention,"" Cohen said.
 The Ministry of Finance is responsible for deciding yen
policy and intervention, while the BOJ executes the trades.
 Government officials tried to talk the yen down last week as
it neared a 14-year high around 85 per dollar set last November,
but Japan has not intervened in the forex market since 2004, even
when the yen soared during the global financial crisis.
 ""Although there are impacts from the yen's rise, we will not
change our scenario that Japan's economy will continue to
recover,"" Kamezaki told reporters after giving a speech to
business leaders in Sapporo, northern Japan.
 ""We need to always watch the impacts of a strong yen on the
economy and financial conditions ... We won't conduct monetary
policy with specific forex levels in mind. We will continue to
watch forex carefully.""
 The euro has lost 14 percent against the yen since the start
of the year and hit a 8-1/2-year low below 107.30 yen last month,
although it has since recovered to 114 yen.
 EXPORTS LIKELY TO MODERATE
 Kamezaki struck a more cautious tone than BOJ Deputy Governor
Hirohide Yamaguchi, who said last week the world's No.2 economy
was showing further signs of a moderate recovery thanks to
increases in exports and production.
 Kamezaki, in his speech, said the pace of growth in Japan's
exports was likely to moderate gradually as companies' inventory
restocking and government stimulus globally ran their course.
 ""The economy's levels are still lower than the levels before
the Lehman shock. This means it is not yet in a strong recovery
led by sustainable moves in domestic demand,"" he said.
 Greece's credit problems could affect Japan indirectly via
its major export destinations such as China and United States,
while the strength of emerging economies could pose a risk if
they overheated and led to strong monetary policy tightening, he
said.
 The central bank would make the utmost effort to help the
economy escape deflation, he said, but gave no clues as to what
policy steps were in store.
 ""Kamezaki expressed concerns about the yen's appreciation.
But his comments are not implying the central bank is ready to do
something to stem the yen's rise,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief
economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
 TATTERED FINANCES
 Japan's economy grew an annualised 5 percent in the first
quarter of this year, but economists say the government, its
hands tied by Japan's huge fiscal debt, could turn to the central
bank to ease its already super-loose monetary policy further
should it see any risk to the economic recovery.
 The government vowed to cap spending and new bond issuance
for next fiscal year at this year's levels in budget guidelines
set on Tuesday, in an effort to fix tattered public finances, but
some analysts doubted the targets will be met.
 Deputy Governor Yamaguchi said last week the central bank was
watching currency moves carefully but also shrugged off any
suggestion that rises in the yen to a specific level would
trigger more monetary easing.
 While yen moves alone are unlikely to produce an immediate
policy response from the BOJ, sharp yen gains accompanied by
stock market falls deep enough to threaten the economy's recovery
could lead to further monetary easing.
 The BOJ, which has kept interest rates at 0.1 percent since
late 2008, eased policy further by putting in place a cheap loan
programme in December 2009 under government pressure to respond
when the yen was surging. It expanded the scheme in March.
 In June, the BOJ detailed a new scheme to encourage
commercial banks to lend more to industries with growth
potential, although analysts say the scheme will do little to
boost the economy.
 Kamezaki, a former executive at a Japanese trading house, has
recently voted with the majority of the board and toed the BOJ's
official line on monetary policy. He left the door open to more
monetary easing in March, soon after the BOJ's latest easing,
warning that deflation is starting to affect public perceptions
about future prices and may complicate the country's exit from
persistent price falls.

 * IMF staff sees yuan undervalued by 5-27 percent
 * Fund sees robust Chinese growth and benign inflation
 * Recommends higher interest rates and 2011 stimulus exit
(Adds details, background, quotes throughout)
 By Alan Wheatley and Lesley Wroughton
 BEIJING/WASHINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - The International
Monetary Fund has chosen not to call the yuan ""substantially""
undervalued, a move that recognises China's efforts to free up
its exchange rate and avoids friction with an increasingly
influential shareholder.
 The summary of an annual review of China's policies omitted
the contentious word, used by IMF Managing Director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn as recently as June, which has long riled Beijing.
 Several members of the IMF's 24-member executive board
believed the Chinese currency was too cheap, the fund said.
 But others said a structural reduction in the balance of
payments surplus was already unfolding thanks to past steps to
boost consumption, while others took issue with an assessment
by IMF staffers that the yuan was substantially undervalued.
 ""This does reflect a softening in the board's position
about the degree of adjustment that is needed in the Chinese
exchange rate regime,"" said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at
the Washington-based Brookings Institution and a former IMF
official.
 He said this was reflected in statements to the IMF board,
which met on Monday, that China had already made a big move
towards greater currency flexibility and progress in
rebalancing demand.
 Beijing dropped the yuan's 23-month-old peg to the dollar
and reverted to a managed float on June 19. China's trade
surplus has also shrunk considerably as government efforts to
pump up the economy have sucked in imports of commodities and
capital goods.
 ""On both counts this conciliatory tone is a little
premature, because despite the announcement there hasn't been
that much movement of the Chinese currency. Any notion that
they have in fact successfully started rebalancing their
economy is also quite premature,"" Prasad said.
 STAFF SAYS STILL UNDERVALUED
 The yuan has risen 0.7 percent against the dollar since it
was unshackled from the U.S. currency.
 Prasad said IMF economists reckoned the yuan was still
between 5 percent and 27 percent undervalued depending on the
methodologies used. A diplomat in Beijing confirmed the range.
 ""Several Directors agreed that the exchange rate is
undervalued. However, a number of others disagreed with the
staff's assessment of the level of the exchange rate, noting
that it is based on uncertain forecasts of the current account
surplus,"" the IMF said.
 Prasad said IMF economists are projecting a big rebound in
the current account surplus, which has fallen to around 4
percent of gross domestic product, whereas China is contending
that it will stay at the new, lower level.
 People familiar with the board's deliberations said
representatives of the Group of Seven rich nations supported
the IMF staff's conclusions but did not specifically call the
yuan ""substantially"" undervalued.
 Reflecting the discussion, the board's concluding statement
omitted the disputed phrase.
 China was so angry with the Fund's exchange rate views that
it withheld cooperation on the annual review from 2007 to 2009.
 Beijing, though, has gradually been gaining clout in the
IMF. Last year it bought $50 billion worth of notes to beef up
the fund's capital and a deputy governor of China's central
bank, Zhu Min, has started work as a special assistant to
Strauss-Kahn.
 RESOURCE SHIFT
 The IMF's choice of words is the second qualified
recognition this month of the progress China is making in
liberalising its exchange rate.
 On July 8, the administration of U.S. President Barack
Obama said the yuan remained undervalued but declined to
designate China a currency manipulator.
 That finding angered U.S. lawmakers, many of whom argue
that China is unfairly holding down its currency to favour its
exporters and are threatening punitive action.
 But a Chinese academic rejected U.S. criticism and said the
yuan, also known as the renminbi, was not too cheap.
 ""The U.S. trade deficit with China has nothing to do with
the yuan's exchange rate,"" He Weiwen, a professor at the
University of International Business and Economics, wrote in
the People's Daily on Wednesday.
 The IMF said the scrapping of the dollar peg would increase
the central bank's flexibility to tighten monetary conditions.
 A stronger yuan rate would also be good for the rebalancing
of the domestic and global economies by shifting China's growth
from exports and investment to private consumption, it said.
 On other issues, the board supported a gradual phase-out of
China's massive fiscal stimulus in 2011, provided the current
trajectory for the economy -- the IMF expects continued robust
growth with benign inflation -- is maintained.
 Directors commended the slower pace of money growth that
China is targeting this year but urged it to raise interest
rates. Unlike many other Asian countries, including India on
Tuesday, China has not increased borrowing costs in 2010.

 * Sales from European units will now make up third of total
 * Funding for the acquisition comes from euro and baht loans

 By Arada Kultawanich
 BANGKOK, July 28 (Reuters) - Thai Union Frozen Products PCL
(TUF), the owner of the ""Chicken of the Sea"" canned tuna brand,
said on Wednesday it would buy MW Brands Holdings SAS for $884
million to become the world's biggest seafood firm.
 TUF is already the world's largest canned tuna maker, while
France-based MW has brands such as canned fish producer John
West and canned tuna producer Petit Navire.
 ""MWB's strong European footprint will provide us with
further business opportunities in the future through a strong
customer base, distribution and brand leadership,"" TUF President
Thiraphong Chansiri said.
 MW was formerly part of HJ Heinz Co and is being sold by
Trilantic Capital Partners, the former private-equity arm of
Lehman Brothers, which bought MW in 2006.
 TUF beat other potential buyers including private equity
firm Blackstone and privately held strategic rival Bolton
Alimentari, people familiar with the matter said.
 TUF's investment, Thailand's second-largest overseas deal,
will boost its tuna processing capacity to 500,000 tonnes per
year.
 Shares in TUF dropped nearly 5 percent at one stage to 45.50
baht due to worries about its debt-to-equity ratio rising to
fund the deal.
 ""With the deal being done through borrowing, this should
bump up its (debt to equity) to 2.2-2.3 times in the short
term,"" said Finansia Syrus Securities analyst Jitra Amornthum.
 However, Jitra added: ""We see positive factors coming in
from marketing. The move should help strengthen TUF's horizontal
expansion by diversifying its customer base into Europe.""
 At the midsession break, TUF shares were down 3.1 percent at
46.25 baht, while the main Thai index was flat.
 
 LOANS
 The 680 million euro deal follows the $2 billion purchase
this month of Australia's Centennial Coal by Banpu, Thailand's
biggest ever overseas acquisition.
 It also marks the latest spot of dealmaking in the food
industry, following frozen-food deals in Italy and France worth
more than $1 billion each, and news that Blackstone is
considering a $3 billion-plus sale of Britain's United Biscuits.
 The deal will add four processing plants in France,
Portugal, the Seychelles and Ghana to TUF's five processing
facilities in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the United
States. Its fishing fleet will more than double to nine vessels
from four.
 The deal would increase Europe's contribution to TUF's sales
to more than a third from 11 percent, the company said.
 MW brands, which has operations in several European
countries including Britain and Italy, had sales of 448 million
euros ($582 million) and total assets of 559 million euros in
its business year that ended in March.
 TUF posted sales of 68.9 billion baht ($2.14 billion) with a
net profit of 3.3 billion baht in 2009. Tuna products accounted
for 44 percent of its sales.
 The Chicken of the Sea name has been around since the 1900s.
Albacore tuna used to be known as chicken of the sea because its
pale colour and mild flavour reminded fishermen of chicken.
 Morgan Stanley and Bualuang Securities advised TUF, while
UBS advised Trilantic.
 Financing for the acquisition has been fully secured, TUF
said, with 340 million in euros in loans from international
banks and a further 15 billion baht from Thai banks.
 TUF also said it would issue convertible bonds worth up to
60 million euros for a private placement plus 116.83 million new
shares for conversion.
 The convertible bonds would have a maturity of four years
with a coupon of 5 percent and an overall yield of 8 percent if
not converted into common shares, it said, adding the conversion
price was 46 baht a share.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 28 (Reuters) - The euro slipped below a key level
against the dollar on Wednesday, dented by profit-taking after it
hit an 11-week high, while the Australian dollar fell as
inflation data pared the chances of an interest rate rise next
week.
 The euro edged down 0.1 percent to $1.2985, falling below the
psychological, and technically crucial, level of $1.30 after it
rose to a high of $1.3045 on Tuesday. The $1.30 level coincides
with a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro's selloff
since mid-April.
 Near-term resistance for the euro is seen at the May 10 high
of $1.3095, followed by $1.3125, which is a 38.2 percent
retracement of the December-June move.
 Despite the euro's easing from highs, sentiment towards the
single currency remains bullish in the short term with a number
of commentators surprised by the resilience of the euro zone
economy. On the other hand, doubts remain over the ability of the
U.S. economy to avoid a slowdown.
 Chartists say a sustained break above the $1.30 level could
place the euro in a new $1.30-$1.35 trading range in the coming
weeks.
 ""The euro continues to flutter about $1.30, while levels such
as $1.3094 loom large as thresholds that would spark further
unwinding of euro short positions,"" David Watt, RBC Capital
Markets senior strategist, wrote in a note.
 Against the yen, the euro dipped 0.3 percent to 113.97 yen,
staying within sight of a two-month high of 114.42 yen struck on
Tuesday.
 Traders said the euro looked increasingly bullish on charts
against the yen, especially after it rose above 113.50 yen where
it had met lots of offers from Japanese exporters.
 The euro is seen facing resistance in the 114.10-114.40 yen
region, the neckline of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern the
pair is about to form after hitting an 8-½ year low of 107.30
yen in late June, traders said. The euro could extend its rally
to the key psychological 120 yen level if it clearly breaks above
that resistance, they said.
 AUSSIE SLIDES AS CPI REMOVES RATE RISK
 The Australian dollar slid 0.8 percent to $0.8941, having
dropped from a 11-week high of $0.9069 reached the previous day.
 Australian consumer prices rose much less than expected last
quarter while core inflation slowed to it lowest in over three
years, greatly lessening the possibility of the Reserve Bank of
Australia raising interest rates -- now at 4.5 percent -- at its
monthly meeting on Aug. 3.
 ""The Aussie has given back some of its recent gains as CPI
data prompted investors to push back expectations for higher
rates,"" said Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Trust &
Banking.
 ""But the Aussie is likely to keep drawing support from
Australian interest rates, which are still the highest among
industrialised countries.""
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 87.77 yen, with patchy U.S.
data continuing to weigh on the greenback.
 U.S. consumer confidence for July fell to its lowest level
since February, and eyes are on consumer durable goods numbers
for June due later in the session to further gauge the health of
the world's largest economy.
 The dollar index was little changed at 82.21, with near-term
support at 81.44, a 50 percent retracement of the index's move
from a low of 74.17 in December 2009 to a high of 88.71 on June
7.

International Monetary Fund's Executive Board believe the yuan is
undervalued, but an annual report on China made no mention of the
exchange rate being ""substantially"" below value.
 Beijing has repeatedly bridled at the fund's long-running
description of the yuan as being substantially undervalued.
 That was the phrase used in the annual report released in
July 2009, and IMF staffers who prepared this year's health check
came to the same view, according to people who saw a draft of
their conclusions.
 However, the ""Article 4"" review approved by the board on
Monday reveals a difference of opinion, with some directors
judging that a structural shift in China's balance of payments is
already under way thanks to past steps to boost consumption.
 ""Several Directors agreed that the exchange rate is
undervalued. However, a number of others disagreed with the
staff's assessment of the level of the exchange rate, noting that
it is based on uncertain forecasts of the current account
surplus,"" the report said.
 The board commended China for dropping the yuan's

 * Euro/yen off 2-mth highs, bullish on charts
 * Focus on Aussie as inflation numbers key for rate case
 SYDNEY, July 28 (Reuters) - The euro hovered below a key
level on Wednesday, running into profit taking after it hit a
11-week high against the U.S. dollar, with attention turning
towards the Australian dollar ahead of crucial inflation data.
 In Asian trade, the euro  slipped below the
psychological, and technically crucial, level of $1.30, having
hit a high of $1.3045 on Tuesday. The $1.30 level coincides with
the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the euro's selloff
since mid-April.
 Near-term resistance for the euro is seen at the May 10 high
of $1.3095, followed by $1.3125 which is the 38.2 percent
retracement of the December-June move.
 Despite the euro easing from highs, sentiment towards the
single currency remains bullish in the short term with a number
of commentators surprised by the resilience of the euro zone
economy. On the other hand, doubts remain over the ability of the
U.S. economy to avoid a slowdown.
 Chartists say a sustained break above the $1.30 level could
place the euro in a new $1.30-$1.35 trading range in the coming
weeks.
 ""The euro continues to flutter about $1.30, while levels such
as $1.3094 loom large as thresholds that would spark further
unwinding of euro short positions,"" David Watt, RBC Capital
Markets senior strategist wrote in a note.
 The euro held impressive gains against the yen ,
trading above 114 yen after having jumped over 1 percent on
Tuesday to a two-month high.
 Traders said the euro looked increasingly bullish on charts
against the yen, especially after it rose above 113.50 yen where
it had met lots of offers from Japanese exporters.
 The dollar slipped against the yen  to 87.75 yen, from
around 87.93 yen late in New York, with patchy U.S. data
continuing to weigh on the greenback.
 U.S. consumer confidence for July fell to its lowest level
since February with all eyes on consumer durable goods numbers
for June later in the session for more evidence about the world's
largest economy.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down 0.02 percent at 82.17, with
near-term support at 81.44, the 50 percent retracement of the
index's move from a low of 74.17 in December 2009 to a high of
88.71 on June 7.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar  held above 90 U.S.
cents, ahead of second-quarter consumer price index (CPI)
numbers. The data is due at 0130 GMT with underlying inflation
likely to make or break the case for a rate hike next week
[AU/ECI].
 Analysts expect underlying inflation to rise 0.8 percent
quarter-on-quarter, and a higher reading could well see the
Reserve Bank of Australia raise the cash rate by 25 basis points
on August 3, supporting the Aussie dollar.
 On the other hand, a lower reading would lead the market to
revise down the chance of a hike and pull the Aussie lower.
Currently, markets are pricing in nearly a 30 percent chances of
a rate rise next week.

 * Sees trip as a ""jobs mission"" to foster future growth
 * Flies in with top executives, BAE could clinch big deal
 
 By Estelle Shirbon
 BANGALORE, July 28 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron will try to persuade India on Wednesday to do more
business with Britain as he seeks new sources of economic growth
to offset deep cuts in public spending at home.
 On his first visit to India since taking office in May,
Cameron leads a delegation including six ministers and more than
30 senior executives from top UK firms, to show that Britain is
serious about boosting economic exchanges with the Asian giant.
 ""I want this to be a relationship which drives economic
growth upwards and drives our unemployment figures downwards,""
he will say in a speech to Indian businessmen, according to
excerpts released in advance by officials.
 He will say his visit to India is ""as much a jobs mission as
a trade mission"".
 India, a former British colony, belongs to the ""BRIC"" group
of rapidly growing emerging economies along with China, Brazil
and Russia.
 Cameron's visit was not intended to yield any immediate
deals between the two governments, but rather was the start of a
long-term British strategy to focus relations with India on
economic exchanges from which both sides stood to gain.
 However, some of the executives on Cameron's plane will be
hoping to return home with contracts in the bag. In particular,
defence group BAE Systems has said it is close to clinching a
deal worth about 500 million pounds ($775 million) to provide 57
Hawk training jets to the Indian air force.
 Other business leaders travelling with Cameron include the
CEOs of banking giant Barclays, infrastructure group Balfour
Beatty, insurance firm Aviva and private equity firm 3i.
 Cameron's coalition government says the British economy is
too dependent on the public sector. It plans to slash public
spending to reduce the budget deficit, which has swollen to a
peacetime record, but critics say this will worsen unemployment.
 The coalition says private businesses should be the engine
of growth, and one of its strategies is to focus diplomatic
efforts on fast-growing emerging markets to promote trade. On
his way to India, Cameron visited Turkey where he made similar
overtures.
 
 ""VESTED INTERESTS""
 ""In Britain, we're waking up to a new reality,"" he wrote in
a column due to appear in Wednesday's edition of the Hindu
newspaper. ""Economic power is shifting -- particularly to Asia
-- so Britain has to work harder than ever before to earn its
living in the world. I'm not ashamed to say that's one of the
reasons why I'm here in India.""
 In his speech in Bangalore, he will cite India's plans to
ramp up investment in infrastructure, as well as its
fast-growing retail and mobile telephone sectors, as
opportunities for British businesses.
 But he will also challenge India to ""take on vested
interests"" and further open up its markets.
 ""We in Britain have welcomed your expertise in car
manufacturing and steel production. But we want you to reduce
the barriers to foreign investment in banking, insurance,
defence manufacturing and legal services -- and reap the
benefits,"" he will say.
 With the World Trade Organisation's Doha round of
multilateral talks making little progress, Britain sees a free
trade deal between the European Union and India as the next big
step forward. Cameron will say he is determined that such a deal
should be reached before the end of the year.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - World stocks reached 2-1/2
month highs on Tuesday on strong corporate earnings, but weak
U.S. consumer confidence limited stocks gains as well as a
rally by the euro against the dollar.
 Equity markets were also supported by global banking
supervisors' plans to scale back proposals to beef up bank
capital and liquidity rules. It was a relief to investors, who
feared tough rules would hit the profitability of the financial
sector. [ID:nLDE66Q0ON].
 Investors began selling shares after a report showed U.S.
consumer confidence fell in July to its lowest level since
February as worries over the job market persisted.
 ""It is certainly disappointing, we had some positive data
late last year and early this year and it seems like momentum
has faded a bit,"" said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast Ltd.,
in New York. ""Clearly the big problem for consumers is jobs.""
 Corporate performance in the second quarter had eased
concerns that the global economy might slow into year end as
fiscal stimulus runs out and austerity programs hit consumer
spending. The Dow Jones industrial average struggled to make
its fourth consecutive winning session, rising 12.26 points at
the close to 10,537.69.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index<.SPX> slipped 1.17 points
to 1,113.84 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 8.18
points to 2,288.25.
 The data clouded the economic outlook, which was supported
on Tuesday by earnings from firms like Dow component DuPont and
Co , which reported second-quarter profit nearly tripled
on strong sales in all five of its businesses.
 Two of Europe's top banks, UBS AG  and
Deutsche Bank AG , also posted results that
reassured investors following last week's regulatory stress
tests. For details see [ID:nN26201739]
 DuPont rose 3.6 percent to $40.38, while U.S.-traded shares
of UBS jumped 8.9 percent to $16.50 and Deutsche Bank gained
2.8 percent to $68.06.
 There were signs corporate profitability could outshine
lingering economic weakness. In the United States, 78 percent
of the 175 companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index <.SPX> have
reported earnings above analysts' expectations, according to
Thomson Reuters data.
 ""It has taken investors a bit to catch on to the sentiment
that earnings are in fact pretty good,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief
technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Boston, who
contended that the rally's pause was not a bearish sign.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.19
percent to hit its highest level since May 14. The Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> was little changed.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.5 percent, and
emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> added 0.64 percent, finding positive
territory for the year.
 In currency trading, the euro  struggled to hold its
gains against the dollar but was trading up 0.07 percent at
$1.3003, after earlier reaching 1.3045.
 The dollar gained against a basket of major trading-partner
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> rising 0.05
percent at 82.13. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar 
rose 1.22 percent to 87.94 yen.
 In bonds, U.S. Treasuries suffered amid equity strength but
narrowed losses after the gloomy consumer confidence report.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury note  yields rose 0.05
percentage point to 3.05 percent.
 A report showed U.S. home prices rose more than expected in
May, but some strength was due to a government tax-credit that
has since expired, economists said.
 Risk premiums on some European debt were reduced as only
seven of 91 of the region's banks failed health-check tests on
their financial standing announced late last week -- five small
Spanish banks, Germany's state-rescued Hypo Real Estate and
Greece's ATEbank. No listed bank failed the tests.
 ""As expected, the transparency has helped, with peripheral
yield spreads versus Germany moving lower,"" Barclays Capital
said in a note to clients.
 ""It is interesting to note that this narrowing has been the
most pronounced for Spain, the country with the largest number
of 'failed' banks. We feel it is precisely this transparency
that has helped the narrowing of the yield spreads.""
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell
$1.54, or 1.95 percent, to $77.44 per barrel, and spot gold
 declined $21.10, or 1.79 percent, to $1160.90 an ounce.

 * US started, then suspended sanctions proceedings in 2008
(Adds background on case, more quotes)
By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. farm group
has urged the Obama administration to begin steps towards
imposing sanctions on the European Union in a longrunning
dispute over the EU's treatment of genetically modified crops.
 The American Farm Bureau Federation, in comments given to
the administration on Monday, complained the EU still has not
complied with a 2006 World Trade Organization ruling against
its ""de facto"" moratorium on approving new varieties of biotech
crops for sale in the 27-nation bloc.
 ""The inability of the EU to operate a timely and
predictable regulatory process ended U.S. corn exports (to the
EU) in 1998 and has reduced corn byproducts substantially,"" the
Farm Bureau said in its recommendations for President Barack
Obama's National Export Initiative.
 ""If the EU does not immediately begin to make timely,
science-based regulatory decisions on pending and future
applications, soybean exports also are at serious risk,"" the
farm group said.
 ""USTR should initiate a retaliation proceeding against the
EU to force compliance with the WTO ruling on GMOs
(genetically-modified organisms),"" the group said.
 The request comes just a few days before U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk is due to give a speech in Pittsburgh
on the Obama administration's efforts to ensure other countries
live up to trade agreements.
 U.S. farmers have widely embraced genetically modified
crops, which offer higher yields with reduced pesticides. But
the technology is viewed with suspicion by many European
consumers because of perceived safety concerns.
 The United States first challenged the EU's de facto
moratorium and other policies that impeded sales of U.S.
genetically modified crops at the WTO in 2003 and was joined by
Canada and Argentina.
 The WTO's 2006 ruling largely backed the complaint brought
by the three countries, who argued the EU was failing to apply
its own scientific approval procedures to GM products.
 Since then, the United States has agreed at least twice to
give the EU more time to comply with the ruling.
 Washington also began steps in January 2008 to retaliate
against the European Union, but later suspended that action.
 The Farm Bureau initially supported the U.S. government
decision not to retaliate in the case in the hope the two sides
would find a way to ""normalize"" trade in biotech crops.
 Now the group said it has changed its mind.
 ""U.S. agriculture has suffered substantial damage from the
EU's failure to abide by its WTO commitments and this damage
will continue to grow as long as the EU does not comply with
the WTO ruling,"" the Farm Bureau said.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro pared gains and
traded little changed against the dollar on Tuesday, backing
off an 11-week high as a drop in U.S. consumer confidence made
investors more risk-averse.
 The euro traded at its highest level since May against the
dollar early in the session. But the single currency erased its
advance after job worries drove July U.S. consumer confidence
to its lowest level since February. Weaker U.S. data tends to
turn investors off riskier assets such as stocks and the euro.
 ""We have a little bit of a rally in the dollar after this
number because even though consumer confidence fell to a
five-month low, the euro is still struggling to sustain a drive
above 1.30, having tested that level on four separate occasions
this month,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at
GFT Forex in New York.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro was little
changed at $1.2996 after touching $1.3045 earlier, according to
Reuters data.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose more than 1 percent to
touch a session high at 87.96 yen. It last traded at 87.93 yen.
 Still, analysts said sentiment on the European currency has
improved and Tuesday's data may not be weak enough to prevent
further gains in the euro and other higher-yielding currencies.
 ""The euro has given back some of its gains early in the
U.S. trading session but with optimism prevailing overall, our
bias remains for global currencies to edge higher this week,""
said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo
Bank in New York.
 Declines in the euro were seen limited while it remained
above support at $1.2870 -- close to its 100-day moving average
-- and last week's low around $1.2730.
 The recent run of better euro zone data continued on
Tuesday, with above-forecast euro zone money supply and German
consumer confidence figures. The fundamental outlook
""seems to be deteriorating in the U.S., while the state of
affairs in the euro zone seems to be looking up relative to
very depressed expectations that had persisted for much of
2010,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto.
 NEXT TARGET
 The next target for the euro, which has risen close to 10
percent since it fell below $1.20 last month, will be $1.3125,
the 38.2 percent retracement of its November-June fall,
technical analysts said.
 ""We are seeing more and more banks alter their forecasts
higher in euro/dollar either from research or from technical
teams,"" said Brad Bechtel, a managing director for trading at
Faros Trading LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. ""The 38.2
percent Fibonacci line comes in around 1.3125 on the charts and
is going to be the first line of resistance,"" he said.
 Still, other analysts, like Shaun Osborne at TD Securities,
said it may be too soon to assume the worst is over for the
single currency.
 ""Everyone seems to love the euro now. They've gone from
thinking the euro zone was going to fall apart to assuming
things are safe and sound,"" he said. ""At best, (the gains)
appear to be short-covering rather than people going outright
long the euro.""
 The aussie rose to an 11-week high against the dollar
before surrendering those gains to trade down 0.1 percent
though it remained above the 90 U.S. cent level for a second
day at US$0.9020. It closed above the 200-day simple moving
average on Monday.

 * 2010 drop follows 24 percent decline in 2009
 HAVANA, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. food sales to Cuba fell by
35 percent from January through May compared with the same
period in 2009, as the cash-strapped nation cut imports and
bought from countries offering credit, a U.S.-based trade group
said on Tuesday.
 The steep decline followed a 24-percent drop in sales to
the island in 2009 after record sales of $710 million in 2008.
 Cuba imports about 60 percent of its food, and the United
States has been the Communist-led island's main provider for
years despite political tensions and the almost
five-decades-old U.S. trade embargo.
 The Caribbean nation is required to purchase agricultural
goods with cash under a 2000 exemption to the embargo, but
Havana is cash-strapped due to the impact of three hurricanes
in 2008, the global financial crisis, lower tourism revenues
and declining earnings for nickel and other exports.
 U.S. food exports to Cuba through May were $182.3 million
compared with $278.2 million during the same period last year,
according to figures released by the U.S.-Cuba Trade and
Economic Council, a New York-based group monitoring trade
between the two countries.
 The report said Cuba was turning more to countries such as
Brazil, France, Canada, Russia and China where it could
purchase food on credit, and to state-run companies from
private ones in many countries.
 Legislation under consideration in the U.S. Congress would
lift restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba and some
regulations on the food sales.
 A broad coalition of farm, business and human rights groups
have backed the bipartisan bill as an important step toward
ending the U.S. embargo and promoting trade and change on the
island.
 Cuban officials have encouraged visiting U.S. trade
delegations to work to abolish the travel ban and lift food
sale regulations, arguing that boosting American tourism to the
island would give Havana more money to buy U.S. goods.
 But John Kavulich, who heads up the U.S.-Cuba Trade and
Economic Council, said he doubted improved regulations would
increase sales due to Cuba's chronic economic problems.
 ""Changes to the existing laws and regulations governing
United States agricultural products and food products will not
result in meaningful increases in exports,"" he said, while not
commenting on the travel ban.
 U.S. exports to Cuba include corn, wheat, chicken, soybeans
and powdered milk.

 * Ban lifted, but still no imports
 * China has since imposed duties on U.S. chicken 

(Adds background, details, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, July 27 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization panel
has ruled in favour of China in its dispute with the United
States over an effective U.S. ban on imports of cooked Chinese
chicken, a Chinese source said on Tuesday.
 The dispute, one of several political and economic
differences dogging U.S.-Chinese relations, originated, like
many trade rows, in health concerns -- in this case U.S.
nervousness about Chinese poultry following outbreaks of bird
flu in Asia.
 Asked whether China had won the case, the source, who is
familiar with the ruling, told Reuters: ""You could say that ...
It went well.""
 The dispute arose because of a spending bill passed by the
U.S. Congress that prevented the authorities from taking any
measures to process imports of Chinese chicken.
 China said the measure was discriminatory and protectionist
because its poultry met international health standards and it
was exporting chicken to Europe and Japan.
 Since the WTO agreed to set up the panel in July last year,
the Senate and House of Representatives -- under pressure from
U.S. meat producers fearing the loss of exports to China --
ended the ban on funding.
 But the ban on imports remains effectively in place as the
U.S. Department of Agriculture is still reviewing Chinese food
safety rules before deciding whether it can start inspections at
Chinese processing plants.
 China is now the third biggest market for U.S. farm goods,
but China has imposed duties that China imposed on U.S. chicken
products that it said were being dumped in the Chinese market or
unfairly subsidised.
 The WTO issued a ruling in the dispute to the two parties on
Monday, but it remains confidential until it is published in a
couple of months time. There was no official comment from
Chinese or U.S. authorities.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Tuesday, backing off an 11-week high as a drop in
U.S. consumer confidence to its lowest level since February
made investors more cautious and risk-averse.
 The euro traded at its highest level since May against the
dollar early in the session but the single currency erased its
gains after the private confidence report for July as weaker
U.S. data tends to trigger risk aversion. For details, see
[ID:nN27219358]
 ""We have a little bit of a rally in the dollar after this
number because even though consumer confidence fell to a
five-month low, the euro is still struggling to sustain a drive
above 1.30, having tested that level on four separate occasions
this month,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at
GFT Forex in New York.
 In mid afternoon trading in New York, the euro was 0.2
percent lower at $1.2966  after touching $1.3045 earlier,
according to Reuters data.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose more than 1 percent to
touch a session high at 87.94 yen . It last traded at
87.83 yen.
 Still, analysts said sentiment on the European currency has
improved and Tuesday's data may not be weak enough to prevent
further gains in the euro and other higher-yielding currencies.
 ""The euro has given back some of its gains early in the
U.S. trading session but with optimism prevailing overall, our
bias remains for global currencies to edge higher this week,""
said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo
Bank in New York.
 Declines in the euro were seen limited while it remained
above support at $1.2870 -- close to its 100-day moving average
-- and last week's low around $1.2730.
 The recent run of better euro zone data continued on
Tuesday, with above-forecast euro zone money supply and German
consumer confidence figures. [ID:nLDE66Q0O4] [ID:nLDE66P1NX]
 The fundamental outlook ""seems to be deteriorating in the
U.S., while the state of affairs in the euro zone seems to be
looking up relative to very depressed expectations that had
persisted for much of 2010,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 NEXT TARGET
 The next target for the euro, which has risen close to 10
percent since it fell below $1.20 last month, will be $1.3125,
the 38.2 percent retracement of its November-June fall,
technical analysts said.
 ""We are seeing more and more banks alter their forecasts

(Adds details, background)
 By Tim Hepher and Matthias Blamont
 PARIS, July 27 (Reuters) - Air France-KLMunveiled a
narrower-then-expected loss in its first quarter as the fallout
from April's ash crisis dropped into second place behind renewed
evidence of an upswing in the economy.
 Europe's largest airline said it had lost 132 million euros
($170.4 million) in the three months to end-June, less than half
the average loss forecast by markets, as premium seats and cargo
space filled up.
 Without the forced shutdown of European airspace due to
concerns over volcanic ash, the airline group said it would have
made a marginal profit. It highlighted a faster-than-expected
recovery in cargo which is seen as a barometer for global trade.
 ""Activity in the first quarter saw a strong recovery in both
passenger and cargo, in spite of the five-day closure of
European air space following the Icelandic volcano eruption,""
the Franco-Dutch airline group said on Tuesday.
 ""The first quarter saw an acceleration in the recovery in
activity levels, particularly in business travel and cargo.
Forward bookings for the second quarter are solid, but
uncertainty surrounding the economic environment and the fuel
price leads us to remain prudent for the second half of the
year.""
 Passenger unit revenues rose 14.8 percent to levels close to
those of 2007-08 and this area would have broken even without
the ash crisis, while cargo would have made 11 million euros.
 
 BREAKEVEN TARGETED
 The European airline's figures came after Singapore Airlines
posted a stronger-than-expected first quarter and forecast a
sustained recovery in its business.
 Leasing firms placed a wave of new plane orders at the
Farnborough Airshow last week in anticipation of recovery from
the airline industry's worst recession.
According to a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus survey,
analysts were on average expecting a first-quarter operating
loss of 277 million euros at Air France-KLM, revenue of 5.43
billion euros and a net profit of 233 million euros.
 The actual operating loss marked a sharp improvement from a
496 million euro deficit in the same period a year earlier.
 Revenue rose 10.7 percent to 5.72 billion euros and net
income, which most analysts following the company consider a
less important benchmark than its operating earnings, swung to a
profit of 736 million euros from a loss of 426 million euros.
For 2010/11 as a whole, Air France-KLM reiterated a target
of breaking even at the core operating level but did not mention
whether this excluded the impact of pre-2009 fuel hedges -- a
proviso included in its last earnings report in May.
 However it said the forecast did exclude the impact of
April's volcano crisis which it pegged at 158 million euros,
broadly the same figure as an earlier provisional estimate.
 Executives were expected to flesh out the forecasts at an
analyst conference call scheduled for 0800 GMT on Wednesday.
 Air France-KLM shares closed before the results
announcement, slipping 0.1 percent to 10.955 euros.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - World stocks reached 2-1/2
month highs on Tuesday on strong corporate earnings, but weak
U.S. consumer confidence limited gains and interrupted a brief
rally by the euro against the dollar.
 Equity markets were also supported by global banking
supervisors' plans to scale back proposals to beef up bank
capital and liquidity rules. It was a relief to investors who
feared tough rules would hit the profitability of the financial
sector. [ID:nLDE66Q0ON].
 But investors began selling shares after a report showed
U.S. consumer confidence fell in July to its lowest level since
February as worries over the job market persisted.
 ""It is certainly disappointing, we had some positive data
late last year and early this year and it seems like momentum
has faded a bit,"" said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast Ltd.,
in New York. ""Clearly the big problem for consumers is jobs.""
 The data clouded the economic outlook, which was supported
on Tuesday by earnings from firms like Dow component DuPont and
Co  which reported second-quarter profit nearly tripled
on strong sales in all five businesses.
 Two of Europe's top banks, UBS AG  and
Deutsche Bank AG , also posted results that
reassured investors following last week's regulatory stress
tests. For details see [ID:nN26201739]
 DuPont rose 4.5 percent to $40.85, while U.S.-traded shares
of UBS jumped 7.4 percent to $16.27 and Deutsche Bank gained
3.3 percent to $68.38.
 Corporate performance in the second quarter had eased
concerns that the global economy might slow into year end as
fiscal stimulus runs out and austerity programs hit consumer
spending. The Dow Jones industrial average struggled to make
its fourth consecutive winning session, rising 9 points at
midday in New York to 10,535.

Thomson Reuters data.
 ""It has taken investors a bit to catch on to the sentiment
that earnings are in fact pretty good,"" said Bruce Zaro, chief
technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Boston, who
added that the rally's pause was not a bearish sign.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.26

point to 3.06 percent.
 Only seven of 91 European banks failed health-check tests
on their financial standing announced late last week -- five

 By Thomas Grove
 ISTANBUL, July 27 (Reuters) - Turkish equities closed at a
record high on Tuesday, while bonds firmed after the central
bank cut its inflation expectations and said interest rates
would not rise until next year.
 Turkish stocks have been among the top gainers of any
emerging market in 2010, rising 14 percent since the beginning
of the year.
 Analysts said Turkish banks were expected to report strong
second-quarter results in early August, and could give fresh
impetus to the Istanbul exchange, which has been hovering around
the psychologically important 60,000 point mark.
 On Tuesday, Turkey's top 100 index closed 1.38 percent
higher at a record 60,328.94. The index also briefly touched
60,662, a new intraday record.
 A banking sector index jumped 1.7 percent.
 ""Second quarter (bank) earnings are estimated to contract by
12 percent quarter on quarter following the strong bottom lines
of the first quarter, but to yield 10 percent year on year
growth nevertheless"" said Istanbul-based Ata Invest in a note.
 Ata said it expected Halkbank, Isbank and Akbank to face the
lowest decline in net earnings, while Bank Asya is estimated to
report the highest quarter on quarter growth.
 ""To see if this is sustainable I would like to see this
drive broaden beyond one or two names. This drive needs to be
confirmed by other stocks,"" said Tunc Yildirim, an analyst at
Dundas Unlu in Istanbul.
 The central bank said on Tuesday it was cutting its end-2010
inflation target to 7.5 percent, from 8.4 percent, and that it
would wait until next year before making ""moderate"" rises in
interest rates.
 The yield on the benchmark April 25, 2012 bond dropped to
8.17 percent from Monday's close of 8.24 percent.
 The Turkish lira firmed to 1.5100 against the dollar on the
interbank market from the previous day's close of 1.5185, buoyed
by European emerging market currency moves.
 The Turkish Treasury on Tuesday sold a net 848.7 million
lira in a tap of a 10-year bond, maturing on Jan 15, 2020, at an
average yield of 8.98 percent, central bank data showed, above
an 8.94 percent forecast.
 It also sold 749.4 million lira of a July 20, 2011 discount
bond at an average compound yield of 7.8 percent, compared with
a forecast of 7.87 percent in a Reuters survey of seven banks.
 A July 19, 2017 floating rate note (FRN) netted 507.3
million lira with an average price of 100.031 lira, compared
with a forecast of 99.67 lira.
 Turkey's Treasury faces redemptions of 12.7 billion lira in

 By Sybille de La Hamaide and Aleksandras Budrys
 PARIS/MOSCOW, July 27 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday denied
market talk it was restricting grain exports, pulling European
wheat prices back from contract highs but not ending concerns
about the impact of Russia's worst drought in years.
 Traders said Russia's drought could lead Moscow to restrict
exports if it judged its internal food security was at risk or
on worries rising grain prices could threaten inflation rates.
 But in a statement issued within minutes of the grain price
spike a Russian agriculture ministry spokeswoman said: ""The
ministry has not sent any grain export restrictions proposals to
the government.""
 By 1258 GMT benchmark November milling wheat futures were up
2.1 percent at 181.25 euros per tonne after a new contract high
of 184.25 euros a tonne a few minutes earlier.
 Traders said the price had spiked on speculation stemming
from an analyst note that there was a ""high chance"" Russia would
ban exports to keep domestic prices from rising further and
boosting food inflation amid heat and drought.
 ""If Russia took such a decision, it would open an avenue for
U.S. and European wheat exports,"" Sebastien Poncelet, analyst
with France's Agritel said.
 The Russian agriculture ministry said last week drought had
killed crops on 10 million hectares, without specifying losses
of grain, which had been sown on 43.6 million hectares. 
 Earlier on Tuesday Russia's Deputy Economy Minister Andrei
Klepach said the country may harvest less than 80 million tonnes
of grain this year, against a previous official grain crop
forecast of 80-85 million tonnes.
 And just before that SovEcon agricultural analysts said the
drought might cut the Russian grain production even further --
to less than 70 million tonnes.
 In a sign that weather problems might be becoming even more
entrenched in the region leading analyst UkrAgroConsult said on
Tuesday Ukraine's government may limit food grain exports in the
second half of the 2010/11 season to avoid domestic shortages in
the wake of crop damage.
 Frosts and drought have destroyed about 1.0 million hectares
of Ukrainian grain crops and the government has said the harvest
could fall to 42 million tonnes in 2010 from 46 million in 2009
and 53.3 million in 2008.

 ROCKETING WHEAT
 News of threats to output in Russia as well as other Black
Sea countries has sent wheat prices rocketing over the past
weeks. 
 European futures gained more than 25 percent since the start
of the month, also powered by the heat wave that lowered
expectations for the European Union's own wheat production.
Crops in France and particularly Germany have been threatened by
heat and drought.
 A possible reason for imposing export restrictions could be
the Russian government's desire to prevent the grain it sells at
home from being exported. Such restrictions normally follow
government grain intervention sales.
 Russia's Agriculture Ministry has announced that it will
sell grain via tenders from its stocks to domestic animal feed
makers and flour millers.
The government plans to sell more than 3 million tonnes of
feed and milling grain to cushion drought damage. The start of
the tenders was initially scheduled for Aug.4, but the ministry
said the start may be delayed.
 In 2008, when world wheat prices surged on low supplies, the
Russian government imposed restrictive export tariffs on wheat
and barley, which practically stopped exports between January
and July.
 But setting an export tariff is a lengthy and multi-stage
procedure requiring endorsements from various Russian government
ministries and approval from Russia's partners in a recently
created customs union -- Belarus and Kazakhstan.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro is unlikely to add much
to its gains against the dollar after its muted reaction to
European bank stress test results as investors focus on euro
zone economic weakness.
 Friday's test results failed to add significant impetus to
the euro's rally. While it edged up to an 11-week high versus
the U.S. currency of $1.3036 on Tuesday, the single currency
will soon head lower as volatility subsides, analysts say.
 Despite Tuesday's gains, the euro hovers near levels in
London on Friday, when test details began to trickle out and
showed all but seven of 91 European banks could cope with
another recession. Analysts say technical resistance is also
capping euro gains.
 The euro has rallied more than 6 percent versus the dollar
this month, putting it on track for its best monthly showing
since May 2009, but much of its strength has been the result of
a weaker dollar as the U.S. economic outlook deteriorates.
 Many analysts had expected that as long as the stress tests
unearthed no nasty surprises, the euro could take a further step
upwards once the event risk was over.
 Some analysts expect the euro to nudge a little higher
against the dollar if U.S. economic data shows further weakness,
but they add that, as negative dollar sentiment subsides, the
euro should retreat later in the year.
 ""The euro should peak as the market gets more accustomed to
the pattern of relatively weak U.S. data and relatively stronger
euro zone data,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 He added that the euro may rise to $1.31 by the end of
September before reversing gains to end 2010 around $1.28.
 
 TECHNICAL RESISTANCE
 Analysts say dollar selling on concern the U.S. economic
recovery has stalled has been overdone as market liquidity dries
up during the holiday season.
 A slowdown in dollar selling will limit the euro's capacity
to strengthen, while any signs the euro zone economy is
struggling will call into question the health of the region's
banks after the stress tests, putting the euro on the back foot.
 ""Evidence of decelerating economic activity will likely
bring back doubts over whether these tests were stressful enough
and provide enough credibility to instill permanent confidence,""
Derek Halpenny, European head of global currency research at BTM
UFJ, said in a note.
 He added that this would prompt more risk aversion, which
would push the euro lower, particularly versus the yen.
 The euro's technical picture shows significant resistance.
Despite poking above the psychologically key $1.30 four times
this month, it has been unable to close above that level, and
other failed attempts to hit it on an intraday basis have helped
fortify that obstacle.
 Above that, $1.3125 is a key level to break if the euro is
to climb higher, as it is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the its peak-to-trough move between November 2009 and June.
 With the stress test results out of the way, volatility in
currency markets should help to prod the euro lower as the risk
premium of holding the single currency decreases compared with
before the tests.
 One-month implied euro/dollar vol fell to around 11.5
percent on Tuesday after climbing near 14.0 percent last week
before the results, according to Reuters data.
 As trading winds down for the holiday season, Simon
Smollett, options strategist at Credit Agricole, said one-month
vol would pull back to around 9.5 percent if euro/dollar risk
reversals come down.
 One-month risk reversals, a measure of currency sentiment,
had jumped in the lead-up to the results to suggest a bias for
euro selling, but Smollett expects a pullback now they are over.
On Tuesday they were around 1.30 percent in favour of euro puts
, inching down from 1.35 percent last week.
 ""Euro/dollar risk reversal is still a little anxious, but it
should come in more,"" he said, adding that this would result in
lower one-month vol, which at the moment was too high given
lower equities volatility as measured by the VIX index.
 Smollett said the slide in euro/dollar vol would help to
push the euro lower, and Credit Agricole analysts said a fall to
$1.2520 in the coming months was possible.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro hit an 11-week high
against the dollar and a seven-week high against the yen on
Tuesday as solid bank earnings lifted equities and encouraged
investors to take on more risk.
 Strong earnings from Swiss bank UBS helped lift European
shares, with banking stocks leading the gains and supporting
the market's relief over the results of last week's European
bank stress tests.
 This was another reason to sell the dollar for the euro and
higher-yielding currencies as recent weak U.S. economic data,
contrasting with better data from Europe and Asia, pushed the
U.S. currency to a 12-week low versus a basket of currencies.
 ""European equities today are up ... helping keep a bid tone
in the euro and urging U.S. equity futures to a positive open
on the day,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The fundamental outlook ""seems to be deteriorating in the
U.S., while the state of affairs in the euro zone seems to be
looking up relative to very depressed expectations that had
persisted for much of 2010,"" he added.
 In morning trading in New York, the euro had climbed around
0.2 percent on the day to $1.3036, according to Reuters data,
its highest since early May.
 The next target for the euro, which has risen close to 10
percent since it fell below $1.20 last month, will be $1.3125,
the 38.2 percent retracement of its November-June fall,
technical analysts said.
 ""We are seeing more and more banks alter their forecasts
higher in euro/dollar either from research or from technical
teams,"" said Brad Bechtel, a managing director for trading at
Faros Trading LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, adding:
 ""The 38.2 percent Fibonacci line comes in around 1.3125 on
the charts and is going to be the first line of resistance.""
 Investor focus will now shift to U.S. consumer confidence
figures to be released at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).
 ING currency strategist Tom Levinson said that if the
consumer confidence data were weak it could provide a catalyst
for a move higher in the euro.
 Declines in the euro were also seen limited while it
remained above support at $1.2870 -- close to its 100-day
moving average -- and last week's low around $1.2730.
 The recent run of better euro zone data continued on
Tuesday, with above-forecast euro zone money supply and German
consumer confidence figures.
 Against a basket of currencies, the dollar hit a 12-week
low of 81.904.
 Stronger appetite for risk also weighed on the low-yielding
Japanese yen, with the euro rising to a seven-week high around
113.96 yen.
 RISK CURRENCIES RISE
 Underscoring a brighter global outlook, India hiked
interest rates on Tuesday, citing inflationary pressures and a
firm economic recovery, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
is expected to raise rates this week.
 Among perceived higher-risk currencies, the New Zealand
dollar hit a six-month high against the U.S. dollar, the
Australian dollar rose to an 11-week high while sterling hit
its strongest level in five months.
 ""The market has drifted away from fears of a double dip,
and the rate tightening environment -- with a rate hike in
India and one expected in New Zealand -- is attracting flows
into higher yielding and emerging market assets and out of the
dollar,"" said Peter Frank, currency strategist at Societe
Generale.

indexes hit their tightest levels in around two months on
Tuesday, supported by reassuring results from Deutsche Bank and
UBS.
By 1129 GMT, the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index
was at 101.5 basis points, according to data from Markit. That

""junk""-rated credits, was at 468 basis points, 13 basis points
tighter.
 Stock markets were also stronger, with the FTSEurotop index
hitting a five-week high. 
 The spread tightening stoked more activity in the corporate
primary market.
 Eastern European lender International Personal Finance
plans to sell a 200 million euro five-year senior unsecured
high-yield bond after initially marketing the deal in March.
 UniCredit said the bonds may be priced to yield 11 to 11.5
percent, a significant premium over recent high-yield deals from
companies including UK furniture retailer DFS Furniture
Holdings.
 The senior financials index was 10.5 bps tighter at 109 bps,
supported by solid bank results and relief over plans by
regulators to scale back tough rules.
 The Basel Committee will scale back many of its proposals to
beef up bank capital and liquidity rules, signaling concessions
in the face of lobbying by banks and governments.
 Less regulatory uncertainty and easing tension following
European bank stress tests may now pave the way for new bank
issues.
 ""The more significant test for banks will be the price
levels at which they can re-enter primary markets,"" Barclays
Capital credit strategists said.
 UBS five-year credit default swaps tightened by 9 bps to
94.5 bps, and its shares jumped 9 percent, after the Swiss bank
said it had slowed the rate at which rich private customers
withdrew funds and also benefited from its strength in equities.
 Deutsche Bank 5-year CDS were 12 bps tighter at 93 bps,
Markit data showed, while its shares rose 3.6 percent.
 Deutsche turned in a net profit of 1.2 billion euros, only
slightly above a poll consensus of 1.04 billion euros, as its
fixed-income division suffered more than UBS in the quarter.

 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro hovered close to a

gains, though Asian central bank demand was seen below $1.30.

 * Says global economy will avoid double-dip recession
 * Invesco holds $32 billion in assets in Japan
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Michiko Iwasaki
 TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - Japanese equities could recover as
much as 17 percent from current levels by the end of the year as
the global economy continues to pick up, the chief investment
officer of Invesco Asset Management Japan said on Tuesday.
 The Japanese unit of Atlanta-based fund manager Invesco is
optimistic about the global economic outlook as markets have
survived bank stress tests in Europe and a series of U.S.
financial regulatory measures, Kunihiko Sugio, who is also a
managing director, told Reuters in an interview.
 ""I wouldn't be surprised if Japanese share prices rose back
to the highs seen earlier this year provided the global economy
picks up at a pace we expect,"" he said.
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock average closed at 9,496.85 on
Tuesday, down about 17 percent from an 18-month intraday high of
11,408.17 reached on April 5.
 The world economy should avoid a double-dip recession as
global financial regulators coordinate much more closely, Sugio
said.
 In addition, China is not expected to take stronger
tightening measures to further cool its economy, he continued.
 Invesco thinks shares of Japanese firms that can draw demand
from China are attractive in the short term, he said.
 The asset company is also interested in companies that are
developing products or technologies to improve energy efficiency
in the long run.
 Investors are looking at firms involved in producing
equipment for nuclear power plants, hybrid cars and inverter air
conditioners, he added.
 ""There are many companies that have been focusing on
developing environmentally friendly products and technologies for
a long time. Such firms are starting to draw strong attention.""
 Invesco is enthusiastic about Japanese stocks as it expands
its equity offerings at a time when many other asset managers are
less keen on shares from the world's second largest economy.
 ""Invesco has combined our teams here, which shows our strong
commitment to the country and Japanese markets,"" Sugio said.
 Invesco completed the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail
asset management business last month, lifting its assets under
management to 2.8 trillion yen ($32.20 billion).
 Invesco as a whole holds $580.8 billion in assets, making it
one of the leading independent global investment management
companies.
 Assets under management in Invesco Japan's active equity
funds totalled around $7 billion as of July 5.
 The tie-up with Morgan Stanley made it possible to introduce
two more active equity funds -- Japanese Equity Advantage
Composite and Japanese Equity Value Composite -- into Invesco's
line-up.

 * Bets on outright products offer small profits
 
 By Henning Gloystein and Jackie Cowhig
 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - A significant drop in volatility
in European power and coal futures since the recession is making
it difficult for financial traders to make money and there seems
little chance of the situation changing anytime soon.
 Indexed close-on-close coal price volatility for delivery
into Europe in 2011 has dropped by 82 percent since December
2008, and the equivalent volatility in the benchmark German 2011
baseload delivery power price has fallen by over 73 percent
since that time.
 The drop in volatility also coincides with falls in
proprietary trading in these markets.
 ""Banks have had to reduce their exposure to markets and have
more stringent liquidity rules to meet now, so there is less
money that can be sent out to work in the markets,"" Alessandro
Vitelli, Director of Markets and Strategy at energy consultancy
IDEAcarbon said. ""So with speculative opportunities dwindling,
and with the liquidity rules biting, there is less money
available to deploy in this way.""

 HEALTHY POWER SUPPLY MARGINS
 Power markets closely reflect industrial sentiment as
wholesale demand is directly affected by industrial activity.
During the first months of the recession in late 2008 and early
2009, volatility in power markets was high, as energy prices
collapsed and traders wondered how long the crisis would last.
 But the picture turned during the summer of 2009 as the
economic outlook began to improve, and power supply margins were
healthy due to low industrial demand and numerous new generation
facilities were added to grids across Europe.
 ""There is not much out there on the macro-economic stage
that causes volatility in energy markets, and the economic
outlook suggests a trading pattern for the coming months or more
much like we saw in 2006 and 2007 when prices moved broadly
sideways,"" one financial trader said.
 ""That might be good for consumers, but it reduces profits
for outright bets, and makes spread trading much more difficult
because the market reacts less to macro-economic events and more
to factors such as weather or unforeseen supply glitches.""

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 For a long-term German year-ahead power graph, click here:
http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/ce/EEX-YA-base.PNG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Another factor that has reduced volatility in the power
sector has been a rise in transparency.
 Across Europe, grid operators and power exchanges have
increased the amount of data they publish, ranging from wind and
solar production forecasts in Germany to improved nuclear
generation data available in France.
 ""Transparency has grown massively in power and carbon
markets, with more market data available in general, and more
price information offered through a the steady migration to
exchanges,"" Vitelli said. ""This makes price discovery easier but
offers less opportunity for profits from proprietary trading.
 
 JP MORGAN SCALES BACK COAL TRADING
 Overall coal volatility has also dropped sharply since late
2008 and markedly so during the past two months, a fall of 70
percent during the past 46 days.
 Coal tends to experience a seasonal lull during the summer
months because utilities around the world pause in their coal
buying until the autumn.
 But this year the summer lull has been deeper than usual
because JPMorgan Chase & Co, which had been arguably the most
active player in the market in 2010, scaled back its coal
trading activity from the beginning of June.
 API2 coal prices were moving $10 or more a day in Q2 but
since June they have barely moved 75 cents, traders said.
 ""Nobody's making much money this year, it's been tough for
everybody,"" said one of Europe's biggest utility traders.
 The increased transparency of the coal market has also made
it harder for traders to make arbitrage profits in 2010. Until
recently, it was still possible to make traditional back-to-back
sales by buying, for example, South African coal FOB Richards
Bay at $90 a tonne and selling to Asian end-users unaware of
current prices at $93, traders said.
 This is no longer possible because Indian and Chinese
buyers, who account for the majority of South African spot
purchases are keenly aware of every price move.
 ""You have to be able to take a view, to take a big position
rather than trade back-to-back. Activity will revive again when
players emerge who are willing to do that,"" another trader said.
 
 GAS MARKET VOLATILITY IS ON THE UP
 In Europe's gas markets, volatility has been generally lower
than in power or coal since late 2008, but technical or
meteorological events have recently caused spikes in prices,
resulting in an overall increase of volatility.
 Data shows the gas market is less prone to macro-economic
developments than power and coal, but reacts nervously to short
term supply concerns such as the Russia/Ukraine gas dispute in
winter 2008/2009, the cold winter of 2009/2010 and the Qatari
and North Sea gas supply difficulties this summer.
 ""The gas market has changed fundamentally in the past years,
with the rise in European LNG terminal capacity effectively
connecting Europe's regional markets with the global LNG
market,"" a gas trader with a British utility said.
 More importantly, however, gas markets have undergone more
fundamental changes in the past few years than other energy
markets, with new elements such as shale gas and increased
liquefied natural gas (LNG) altering the nature of gas trading.
 ""Gas markets are a lot more nervous than others because of
the deep changes to its structure in recent years, and this
collided with the uncertainties of the post-recession economy,
so volatility here is on the up,"" one gas trader said.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro hovered close to a
two-month peak against the dollar on Tuesday, retaining support
after last week's European bank stress tests revealed no horrors
while increased demand for riskier assets weighed on the dollar.
 Although concerns lingered that the stress tests were not
tough enough, analysts said these could be calmed when Deutsche
Bank discloses its exposure to euro zone sovereign debt.
 The dollar fell to a 12-week low against a basket of
currencies as recent weak U.S. data accompanied an otherwise
brighter outlook for the broader global economy, encouraging
investors to move into higher-yielding and riskier assets.
 Underscoring this, India hiked interest rates on Tuesday,
citing inflationary pressures and a firm economic recovery,
while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to raise rates
later this week.
 ""We are seeing a more risk friendly environment,"" said Peter
Frank, currency strategist at Societe Generale. 
 ""The market has drifted away from fears of a double dip, and
the rate tightening environment -- with a rate hike in India and
one expected in New Zealand -- is attracting flows into higher
yielding and emerging market assets and out of the dollar"".
 At 0807 GMT, the euro was steady at $1.2992, having earlier
risen as high as $1.3023. Traders cited Asian central bank bids
around $1.2970-80, but said reported offers above $1.3020 on
behalf of a European sovereign were capping gains.
 The euro headed towards last week's more than two-month peak
of $1.3029. If it scales this, its next target will be $1.3125,
the 38.2 percent retracement of its December-June fall,
technical analysts said. 
 Falls were also seen limited while it remained above support
at $1.2870 -- close to its 100-day moving average -- and last
week's low around $1.2730. 
 Traders were cautious as they awaited clarity on Deutsche
Bank's debt exposure after the German bank posted second-quarter
earnings.
 However, they said if the bank discloses no shocks, this
could help build confidence in euro zone banks and dispel
concerns about a lack of transparency in the stress tests,
triggering buying in the euro.
 ""Despite all the negative talk about the stress test
results, German interest rates are rising and the euro firmed,
which seems to suggest lingering euro short-covering needs,""
said Osamu Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citibank in Tokyo.
 
 DOLLAR INDEX
 The dollar index was steady at 82.102, having earlier fallen
to 81.913, its weakest since early May.
 Sterling hit a five-month high of $1.5530 as the UK currency
made further gains in the wake of surprisingly strong gross
domestic product data on Friday.
 Among higher-yielding currencies, the Australian dollar was
steady at $0.9023, holding above the key $0.90 level and close
to 11-week high of $0.9031 hit on Monday, while the New Zealand
dollar touched a six-month high of $0.7355.
 Investors' greater appetite for risk also weighed on the
low-yielding yen, with the U.S. dollar gaining 0.4 percent to
87.19 yen. The euro rose to a seven-week high against the yen
of 113.64 yen, with traders saying gains accelerated after
stops were triggered above 113.50 yen.

 * UBS leads European gains after strong results
 * Euro near two-month peak vs dollar
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a 2-1/2 month
high on Tuesday while the euro held near a two-month peak versus
the dollar as upbeat results from Swiss bank UBS added to a
recent run of strong corporate earnings.
 Global banking supervisors' plans to scale back proposals to
beef up bank capital and liquidity rules also came as a relief
to investors who had feared tough rules would hit the
profitability of the financial sector.
 UBS rose more than 9 percent after saying strong equities
and currency revenues drove its second-quarter net profit well
above forecasts.
 In the United States, 78 percent of the 175 companies in the
benchmark S&P 500 index have reported earnings above analyst
expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 The strong corporate performance in the second quarter has
eased concerns that the global economy might slow down towards
the end of the year as fiscal stimulus runs out and austerity
programmes hit consumer spending.
 ""Expectations are rising for earnings. Companies are guiding
full-year forecasts up in spite of concerns about a loss of
recovery momentum ... and that is helping to keep these markets
reasonably firm,"" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin
Dolphin.
MSCI world equity index rose 0.5 percent to hit its highest
level since mid-May. The Thomson Reuters global stock index
gained 0.3 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 percent. Banks were top
gainers, rising 4 percent.
 U.S. stock futures rose half a percent, pointing to a firmer
start on Wall Street later.
 Emerging stocks added 0.7 percent to come into positive
territory for the year for the first time in 2-1/2 months.
 The Basel Committee said it would scale back many of its
proposals to beef up bank capital and liquidity rules,
signalling concessions in the face of lobbying by banks and
governments.
 The committee published a draft Basel III reform in December
that would force banks to hold more and better quality capital
to withstand future shocks without taxpayer help again.
 U.S. crude oil erased early losses to rise 0.1 percent on
the day to $79.07.
 German bund futures were steady on the day.
 The premium that investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish
and Irish government bonds rather than euro zone benchmark
German Bunds fell to multi-week lows as investors switched into
higher yielding issues.
 Only seven of 91 European banks failed health-check tests on
their financial standing announced late last week -- five small
Spanish banks, Germany's state-rescued Hypo Real Estate and
Greece's ATEbank. No listed bank failed the tests. 
 ""As expected, the transparency has helped, with peripheral
yield spreads versus Germany moving lower,"" Barclays Capital
said in a note to clients.
 ""It is interesting to note that this narrowing has been the
most pronounced for Spain, the country with the largest number
of 'failed' banks. We feel it is precisely this transparency
that has helped the narrowing of the yield spreads.""
 The dollar was steady against a basket of major currencies,
while the euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3000, within half a cent
of a two-month peak around $1.3029.

 TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro ticked up towards a
two-month peak above $1.3000 on Tuesday, although traders were
cautious about bidding it up too much as they await clarity on
Deutsche Bank's exposure to euro zone sovereign debt.
 Deutsche posted second-quarter pretax profit in line with
expectations but it has not revealed its exposure to European
sovereign debt following tests to see how well banks in the
region would stand up to financial shocks.
 Some traders said that if the bank gives details and there
are no shocks, that could help build more confidence in euro zone
banks and trigger buying in the euro.
 In that case, the single currency's next target would be last
week's two-month high of $1.3029 and then $1.3125, a 38.2 percent
retracement of its December-June fall, technical analysts said.
 ""Despite all the negative talk about the stress test results,
German interest rates are rising and the euro firmed, which seems
to suggest lingering euro short-covering needs,"" said Osamu
Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citibank in Tokyo.
 The euro rallied on Monday on relief the tests were over,
although concerns they were not rigorous enough mean investors
are still hesitant to make big bets on it, while some traders say
euro zone debt redemptions this week could also constrain it.
 Citi estimates there are some 45 billion euros worth of
maturing bonds and coupon payments this week.
 The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.3009. It climbed as high as
$1.3019 earlier. Any fall was seen likely to be limited while it
remained above support at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average
-- and last week's low around $1.2730.
 The euro gained 0.2 percent to 113.11 yen. It has met stiff
resistance at 113.30-50 in the past two weeks, partly on selling
by Japanese exporters.
 But Takashima said it was likely to rise above 113 yen.
 ""It's true Japanese exporters were lowering their target
price to around 113 yen from 118 yen. But looking at trade data,
exports to Europe are stagnating, which points to limited selling
by exporters,"" he said.
 The Aussie was steady on the day at $0.9021, after rising 0.9
percent on Monday as investor risk appetite revived after the
stress test results.
 Chartwise it could be set to rise against the yen. On the
daily Ichimoku chart for Aussie/yen, the tenkan sen has risen
above the kijun sen line, in a bullish signal.
 The top of the Ichimoku cloud now lies roughly around 80 yen,
and a rise above that level would be another bullish sign.
 ""I think investors will tiptoe back into high-yielders as
worries about Europe will gradually subside,"" said a trader at a
Japanese brokerage house.
 The U.S. dollar gained 0.1 percent against the yen to 86.97
yen, though it was capped by offers around 87 yen from Japanese
exporters.

 Citi estimates there are some 45 billion euros worth of

 The euro was flat on the day at $1.2995 after ticking above

 Any fall was seen as limited while it remained above support
at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average -- and last week's low

 The euro also strengthened 0.2 percent against the Aussie,
which softened after hitting a 2 1/2-month high against the U.S.
dollar in the previous session.
 The Aussie tends to gain with when investors are more risk
tolerant but a fall in Shanghai share prices on worries about
possible losses in local banks lending to local governments and
property sapped its strength.
 The euro fetched A$1.4411, about a cent above a double-bottom
around A$1.4320 formed this month.
 But it needs to clear A$1.5143 to end a downtrend in place
since late 2008, technical analysts at RBC Capital Markets said
in report.
 The Aussie was steady on the day at $0.9016, after rising the
most among major currencies on Monday as investor risk appetite
revived after the stress test results.
 But chartwise it could be set to rise against the yen. Its
Ichimoku charts showing the pair's tenkan sen line rises above
kijun sen line, a bullish signal.
 A rise above 79.97 yen within the next three weeks will put
the currency above the Ichimoku cloud, another strong buy signal.

 HONG KONG, July 27 (Reuters) - Asian stocks pulled back
slightly from two-and-a-half month highs hit earlier on Tuesday
after upbeat U.S. housing data, while the euro neared 2-month
peaks on relief over stress tests on European banks.
 Financial markets are awaiting a slew of data from the

 The euro was just above a key resistance of 1.30 
with sentiment buoyed after the stress tests. Analysts are now
eyeing a 2-month high of $1.3029 hit last week as the next
test.
 High-yielding currencies like the Australian and New

 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks

<.MIAPJCD00PUS> sectors.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2010 12:04AM ET</span>",Latin America should embrace India trade -IADB," * No direct shipping services connect Latin America, India
 * High import tariffs dampen trade despite big potential
 By Laura MacInnis
 BUENOS AIRES, July 27 (Reuters) - Latin America sends only
0.9 percent of its exports to India, a commodity-hungry country
that should be a major growth engine for the region, the
Inter-American Development Bank said in a report on Tuesday.
 The IADB bemoaned the lack of direct shipping services
between Latin America and the South Asian nation of 1.1 billion
people and said punitive import taxes were stifling the
potential for closer ties at a pivotal time for the global
economy.
 Economic output from China and India together is expected
to be up to 10 times larger than Europe's total gross domestic
product by 2040, according to the Washington-based regional
lender, whose 48 members include China but not India.
 While China receives 3.8 percent of Latin American exports,
India is ""not yet on the radar"" of the region's businesses and
politicians, said IADB President Luis Alberto Moreno, calling
in the report's preface for more attention to India.
 ""We are starting to see what the century of Asia will look
like and Latin America cannot afford to be absent,"" he said.
""The region cannot afford to continue to ignore the
implications of (India's) emergence.""
 Unlike in the case of China, there are no direct shipping
routes between India and Latin America, the IADB report said.
Goods are sent via Singapore or Europe, increasing both freight
rates and shipping times -- by as much as nine days in the case
of Brazil, it said.
 ""A 10 percent reduction in freight rates would likely boost
imports of Indian goods by as much as 46 percent and 47 percent
in Chile and Argentina, respectively,"" the IADB said.
 India and Latin America also impose huge import duties on
goods shipped between them despite a series of accords over the
past decade that Moreno said have ""yet to effectively address
the most obvious and serious obstacles to bilateral trade.""
 Latin American agricultural goods face average tariffs of
65 percent upon entry to India, more than five times China's
12.5 percent average tariff, according to the IADB figures
dating to 2006 and 2007.
 Indian manufactured goods, in turn, are charged tariffs of
up to 9.8 percent in Latin America. Cutting those tariffs on
Indian products by 10 percent would spur a 36 percent jump in
Indian goods entering Chile and Argentina, the report found.
 TARIFFS AND TRADE BARRIERS
 ""In order to boost trade, both India and Latin America must
lower tariffs and trade barriers,"" it said.
 India replaced China as the biggest market for Argentine
soybean oil after Beijing imposed a boycott in late March in
response to Argentina's anti-dumping duties on certain Chinese
products like shoes, textiles and steel products.
 Argentine Agriculture Minister Julian Dominguez will go to
India, the world's biggest importer of edible oils, next week
to discuss potential for continued soy oil and sunflower oil
sales, the ministry said on Monday.
 Rengaraj Viswanathan, India's ambassador to Argentina, said
there is enormous demand for edible oils in his country and
suggested Indian tariffs on agricultural goods are not proving
a problem for exporters from Latin America.
 ""No one has come to us saying, 'We can't export because of
your high tariffs,'"" he told Reuters in Buenos Aires.
""Argentina has surplus agricultural produce and is an efficient
producer, so there is a lot of opportunity.""
 In its report, the IADB argued that demand for Latin
America's natural resources ""should be strong enough to send
bilateral trade soaring"" as India seeks agricultural goods and
minerals like copper to tackle poverty and build needed
infrastructure.

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2010 10:32PM ET</span>","PREVIEW-Japan, Korea automakers Q1 seen strong; outlook shaky"," * April-June earnings powered by strong U.S., China sales
 * Japan makers seen giving cautious outlook despite brisk
Q1
 * Forex, higher input costs, demand uncertainty to weigh
 By Chang-Ran Kim and Cheon Jong-woo
 TOKYO/SEOUL, July 27 (Reuters) - Top Japanese and Korean
automakers are set to report a sharp improvement in April-June
earnings as car demand in major markets soared, but the coming
quarters look tough due to rising commodity prices and a
slowdown in sales.
 Japan's Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor
Co must also contend with a weaker dollar, now trading around
87 yen, against their assumption of 90 yen and an average 92
yen in the latest quarter.
 The euro, too, has drifted to a far less favourable 113
yen, but analysts said the smaller exposure to Europe would
limit any damage. Toyota has assumed a euro rate of 125 yen for
the year, while Honda and Nissan set the rate at 120 yen.
 ""If forex assumptions are tweaked just for the weaker euro,
there would actually be potential for an upward revision, since
the first (April-June) quarter was stronger than expected,"" UBS
auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said.
 ""But the main question is: what's in store for the rest of
the year? There are uncertainties in exchange rates, materials
prices and sales volumes,"" he added.
 Six analysts surveyed by Reuters put Toyota's first-quarter
operating profit at an average 146 billion yen ($1.67 billion)
-- more than the company's forecast for a 100 billion yen for
the six months to Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, Toyota
made an operating loss of 195 billion yen.
 Honda and Nissan are expected to report a surge from the
slim operating profits they made in the first quarter last
year.
 Still, with a U.S. sales recovery looking weaker than
anticipated and European consumption shaky from the region's
debt crisis, many analysts, including Sanger, said they expect
automakers to paint a cautious picture for the rest of the
year. Japanese scrappage incentives are also set to expire at
the end of September -- a negative especially for top
beneficiary Toyota.
 ""We do not expect firms to raise full-year guidance as the
North American market recovery is slower than expected, Europe
is weaker than expected, and the yen is appreciating,"" Morgan
Stanley analyst Noriaki Hirakata said in a report.
 That was true also for South Korea's top brand, Hyundai
Motor Co, according to analysts.
 ""The industry's momentum will definitely get weaker in the
third and fourth quarter due to an economic slowdown and
tougher competition,"" said Ahn Sang-joon, an analyst at Tong
Yang Securities in Seoul.
 MOMENTUM SLOWS IN U.S., CHINA
 New vehicle sales in the United States -- traditionally a
cash cow for Japan's top three brands -- grew by double-digits
in April and May but slipped in June, raising doubts about the
strength of the recovery predicted at the start of the year.
 Sales in China, the world's biggest auto market, also
disappointed in June, with growth slipping below 20 percent for
the first time in 14 months as the impact of government
stimulus faded and labour disputes at auto factories dented
production.
 Intermittent production stoppages in China over the past
few months, mainly at Honda-related plants, are expected to be
reflected in July-September because profits made in China are
booked one quarter behind.
 In the United States, Japanese automakers have faced stiff
competition from Hyundai as it grabbed more market share in the
world's second-biggest auto market despite spending less on
profit-eroding sales incentives.
 Hyundai, the world's fifth-biggest automaker along with its
affiliate Kia Motors Corp, is expected to report a 32 percent
rise in its second-quarter net profit, according to a poll of
26 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, driven by stronger
demand for its cars in China and the United States.
 Estimates have Kia's net profit rising 27 percent.
 Hyundai and Kia's earnings have been boosted since last
year by new and competitively priced models such as Hyundai's
Sonata sedan, the high-end Genesis and Kia's Forte compact car.
 With more products in the pipeline including the remodelled
Elantra -- its best-selling car -- next month, and the Azera
mid-sized sedan later this year, analysts said Hyundai would
likely cope relatively well with a slowdown in demand.
 ""New models will be able to ease demand concerns,"" said Yim
Eun-young, an analyst at Dongbu Securities in Seoul.

 * Caution over stress test results cap euro's advance
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - The euro held near a two-month
peak against the dollar on Tuesday on relief over stress tests on
European banks, but it was capped at $1.30.
 Initial relief in markets that most European banks passed the
regulator's tests was being replaced by concern the tests were
not rigorous enough, making traders hesitant to bid up the euro.
 ""I suspect the euro could face stiff resistance around $1.30.
There is still a lot of criticism about the stress tests, which
markets will eventually price in,"" said Daisuke Karakama, a
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 Caution also set in ahead of earning reports by some European
banks later on the day, including Deutsche Bank, which has not
revealed its exposure to Southern European countries in the wake
of the publication of stress test results.
 The euro was little changed in early Asian trade at $1.2985,
after having risen around 0.7 percent on Monday but stopped short
of testing last week's two-month high of $1.3029.
 Technical analysts said the euro may still push toward
$1.3125, a 38.2 percent retracement of its December-June move,
should it clearly break above $1.30.
 Any fall in the euro was also seen limited while it remained
above support at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average -- and
last week's low around $1.2730.
 Against the yen, the euro was flat at 112.80 yen. It has met
stiff resistance around the 113.30-50 area in the past two weeks,
partly on selling by Japanese exporters.
 But Osamu Takashima, chief FX strategist at Citibank in
Tokyo, said the euro is likely to rise above 113 yen.
 ""It's true Japanese exporters were lowering their target
price to around 113 yen from 118 yen. But looking at trade data,
exports to Europe are stagnating, which points to limited selling
by exporters,"" Takashima said.
 ""Despite all the negative talk about the stress test results,
German interest rates are rising and the euro firmed, which seems
to suggest lingering euro short-covering needs,"" he said.
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 86.87 yen.
 High-yielding currencies slipped after having risen the most
among major currencies on Monday after the stress test results
whetted investors' risk appetite.
 The Australian dollar eased 0.1 percent to around $0.9010,
not far from 2 1/2-month high of $0.9037 hit on Monday.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2010 05:44PM ET</span>",Business groups recommend ways US govt can double trade," * Groups says trade deals best way to boost US exports
 * Export control reform, export promotion also touted
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
needs to quickly win approval of free trade agreements with
South Korea, Colombia and Panama and start talks on new trade
deals with Brazil, India and others if he if serious about
doubling exports, U.S. business groups said on Monday.
 ""We must be extremely aggressive,"" Rosemarie Watkins,
director for international policy at the American Farm Bureau
Federation, told reporters.
 Passing the three trade deals and negotiating new
agreements could boost U.S. manufactured goods exports $100
billion by 2014, said Frank Vargo, vice president for
international economic affairs at the National Association of
Manufacturers.
 The comments came on the final day for groups to make
recommendations for Obama's National Export Initiative, which
aims to double U.S. exports to around $3.0 trillion in five
years.
 Based on those ideas and its own deliberations, the Obama
administration will issue a report in September on how it
intends to achieve its goal.
 Many of Obama's fellow Democrats are wary of trade
agreements and are resisting his push to bring the pact with
South Korea to a vote by early next year.
 They blame manufacturing job losses on trade deals that
opened the U.S. market to more imports and encouraged
U.S. companies to move plants overseas.
 Supporters say the pacts are good for the United States
because they expand exports and reduce the cost of imported
goods, giving consumers more choices.
 The issue could play into U.S. elections in November, with
Republicans criticizing Democrats for years of delay on trade
deals while other countries have pushed ahead.
 Vargo said the United States has to consider free trade
deals with Brazil, India, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and members of the Gulf Cooperation Council if it wants
to keep pace with export competitors.
 Without that push and other major policy changes,
long-trend economic trends suggest U.S. manufactured goods
exports in 2014 will reach just $1.5 trillion, Vargo said.
 That is about $300 billion less than is needed to double
exports from $900 billion in 2009, he said.
 Similarly, Bob Vastine, president of the Coalition of
Service Industries, said he expected U.S. service exports to
hit just $620 billion by 2014 under current policy, or about
$340 billion less than needed to double exports.
 The groups made other several recommendations for doubling
exports, and said they hoped the Obama administration would
spell out in its September report how much of a boost it
expected from different initiatives.
 Vargo estimated revamping Cold War-era export controls and
boosting funding for government export promotion and export
financing could together boost U.S. exports by more than $170
billion over the next five years.
 Tackling nontariff barriers that block U.S. exports, making
it easier for foreign business people to get visas to come to
the United States and leaning harder on foreign governments to
protect U.S. intellectual property rights could collectively
add another $60 billion, he said.
 A successful conclusion of the long-running Doha round of
world trade talks also would give exports a shot in the arm.
But many of those gains would not show up for years under
current proposals in the talks, the groups said.

 LOS ANGELES, July 26 (Reuters) - Eye care products maker
Alcon Inc , which is being acquired by Swiss drugmaker
Novartis AG , reported a 15 percent jump in quarterly
profit and raised its full-year outlook as sales grew in key
product areas including implanted lenses and glaucoma.
 Alcon on Monday posted a net profit of $670 million, or
$2.21 a share -- up from $582 million, or $1.94 a share, a year
earlier.
 Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.22 per
share, which beat the average analyst estimate of $2.03 per
share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
 Sales rose 12.5 percent to $1.89 billion.
 The company raised its outlook for full-year 2010 earnings
to between $7.45 and $7.62 a share, from a previous range of
$7.30 to $7.55 a share, citing higher organic sales growth in
the high single digits.
 The planned Novartis acquisition remains contentious as the
drugmaker continues to offer minority shareholders
substantially less to tender their Alcon shares than it has
agreed to pay Swiss conglomerate Nestle  for its
majority stake in Alcon.

 * Euro up versus dollar on upbeat European data
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Monday
after U.S. data showed a pick-up in new home sales, reviving
hopes for improvement in a tepid economic recovery, while the
euro firmed against the dollar on increased risk tolerance.
 The euro climbed to $1.30, the highest since July 20,
getting a boost from investors' positive reaction to results of
tests of European banks' health released late on Friday.
 Sales of single-family U.S. homes in June jumped 23.6
percent, the largest increase since May 1980, from the prior
month's record low, pushing U.S. Treasury prices lower and
supporting oil prices. For details, see [ID:nN23137243]
 ""There was a big revision down in the prior month, but then
obviously a rebound this month. We're still at these trough
levels, which we've been bouncing along. It's a good sign that
we did see an increase after the tax credit expired,"" said
Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at BTIG LLC, in New
York.
 O'Rourke referred to an Obama administration tax break for
home buyers to stimulate the economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 100.81
points, or 0.97 percent, at 10,525.43. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 12.35 points, or 1.12 percent, to
1,115.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 26.96
points, or 1.19 percent, to 2,296.43.
 U.S. stocks also got a lift from FedEx Corp  after
the bellwether raised its earnings outlook, sending its stock
up more than 4 percent. Stronger outlooks for transportation
firms like FedEx are seen as a sign of growing economic
demand.
 European shares closed at a five-week high, helped by the
U.S. housing data, with the banking sector among the top
performers following the bank stress test results.
 The tests were aimed partly at opening the door to funding
markets for a batch of southern European banks and lowering
costs for other lenders. [ID:nLDE66N02E]
 Seven of 91 banks failed the test, including five from
Spain, and another 17 barely passed the EU tests, which have
been widely criticized as not demanding enough.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed 0.4 percent higher at 1,048 points.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1.15
percent and the Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 1 percent.
 After Friday's release of the European bank stress test
results and Monday's strong U.S. housing data for June, the
euro  touched $1.30 against the dollar, the highest since
July 20. On electronic trading platform EBS, it later hovered
around $1.2992, still up 0.68 percent.
 Investors were upbeat about a series of reports in the past
week showing the broader European economy was stronger than
thought.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.69
percent at 86.84 from a previous session close of 87.440.
 Purchasing managers' indexes indicated third-quarter euro
zone growth of around 0.6 to 0.7 percent. German business
sentiment also posted a record jump in July to its highest
level in three years. Britain, not in the euro zone, added to
the mix with an economy growing twice as quickly as expected in
the second quarter.
 ""Despite the market's single-minded focus on the stress
tests, the more important story was the surprisingly strong
economic data from the region (last week),"" said Boris
Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT in New
York.
 U.S. Treasuries were mixed as benchmark 10-year Treasury
note's 3 percent yield drew some buyers.
 ""The overarching factor (that pushed) yields higher was
relief that the stress tests had come and gone without major
incident,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist for
Prudential Fixed Income, whose team helps oversee approximately
$240 billion in fixed income assets.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
1/32, with the yield at 2.9942 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at
0.5964 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
unchanged with the yield at 4.0202 percent.
 U.S. crude oil prices turned positive after the economic
data, having been pressured earlier on Tropical Storm Bonnie's
fade from the Gulf of Mexico.
Oil  was trading at around $79 a barrel, flat after
rising on the U.S. housing data. The price of gold  fell
$7.35, or 0.62 percent, to $1181.20, as the metal lost some of
its safe-haven appeal due to the European stress test results,
robust U.S. company earnings and vigorous euro zone data.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 OTTAWA, July 26 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rose to
its highest level in more than a week against the U.S. currency
on Monday, spurred by more positive news that the global
economy is mending.
 Risk appetite barometers such as stock markets gained on
U.S. government data that showed sales of new single-family
homes rebounded strongly in June from May's record low, while a
rosier outlook from economic bellwether FedEx Corp. 
also boosted confidence. [ID:nN23137243] <.SPX> [.N]
 ""The world feels a little rosier,"" said Eric Lascelles,
chief Canada macro strategist at TD Securities.
 The Canadian currency  finished at C$1.0324 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.86 U.S. cents, not far off its best level
since July 15 at C$1.0303 to the U.S. dollar or 97.06 U.S.
cents.
 It was also up moderately from Friday's finish at C$1.0361
to the U.S. dollar, or 96.52 U.S. cents, up for a third
straight session.
 A steady price of oil, a key Canadian export, close to $79
a barrel was also mildly supportive.
 CANADIAN BONDS EDGE DOWN
 Bond prices were slightly lower as investor favor flowed to
riskier assets as economic sentiment picks up.
 Along with the U.S. housing data, better-than-expected
purchasing data in the euro zone and growth data in Britain
boosted confidence in the world economy.
 The two-year bond  was 3 Canadian cents lower to
yield 1.599 percent, while the 10-year bond  was
down 3 Canadian cents to yield 3.231 percent.
 Domestic data is otherwise fairly light until Friday's GDP
for May. Analysts expect the economy to have grown 0.1 percent
in the month, in line with a slower pace than in the first
three months of the year.
 ""It'll grow but not by a whole lot. My gut instinct is to
say that there are going to be some worriers wondering whether
Canada is double-dipping already. I think that's an overblown
concern,"" said Lascelles.
 ""It's certainly true that the rate of growth has slowed,
but we are still seeing quite impressive job gains. Leading
indicators are still looking fairly good, credit is still
flowing.""

 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to $1.30
on Monday as relief over European bank stress tests and
stronger economic data on both sides of the Atlantic gave
investors less reason to be risk averse.
 Worries the tests were not strict enough had some investors
hesitant to make big bets on the single currency. But as the

most were more concerned about missing an uptrend of several
days.

 ""Despite the market's single-minded focus on the stress
tests, the more important story was the surprisingly strong
economic data from the region (last week),"" said Boris
Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT in New
York.
 In late-afternoon New York trade, the euro rose as high as
$1.3006 on electronic trading platform EBS  and
$1.3005 on Reuters data . The currency last traded up 0.7
percent at $1.2992.
 Price action looked as if an options barrier was being
defended at $1.3000, though analysts said they doubted a
barrier existed, given trades had breached that level on both
July 16th and July 20th. The level may be a psychological
barrier, however, as the euro has not closed above $1.3000
since early May.
 Fear of a euro-zone debt crisis and its impact on European
banks drove the euro below $1.19 last month, its lowest level
since 2006, but it began a swift recovery in July.
 That was partly driven by data showing the euro zone
economy has been holding up better than anticipated, even as
governments tighten their belts to rein in large deficits.
 The stress tests results, which showed only seven of 91
banks failed, helped drive the euro further. For more on the
tests see [ID:nLDE66M1T3]
 PUSH TOWARD $1.31
 Technical analysts said the euro may still push toward
$1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement of the December-to-June
move. It reached $1.3028 last week, according to Reuters data.
 Any fall in the euro was also seen limited while it
remained above support at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average
-- and last week's low around $1.2730, leaving it hemmed in
within a range.
 Some said the euro's gains could also be constrained by
this week's redemption of maturing euro zone bonds and coupon
payments worth some 45 billion euros, according to Citi
estimates. [ID:nLDE66M1PR]
 ""The stress tests failed to inspire much of a euro/dollar
rally, but at the same time there is no reason for bears to
start selling the euro aggressively either,"" said Roberto
Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 The euro rose to its highest since early June against the
yen on electronic trading platform EBS  as dealers
unwound long yen positions. But then ran into offers from
Japanese exporters around 113.30/50 yen. It was last down 0.1
percent at 112.80 yen.
 The dollar was 0.7 percent lower at 86.83 yen , the
session low.
 Analysts said Monday's U.S. new home sales report was a
""good surprise"" after a string of lackluster data, but more
evidence was needed to reassure investors the economic recovery
in the United States was still on track.
 ""The data was pretty surprising, especially considering how
poor the numbers were last month. But the jury really is still
out,"" said John Doyle, senior currency strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 ""Unless you see a continued pattern of positive numbers, I
think traders are going to be skeptical,"" he added. ""That's why
the dollar reaction has been pretty muted.""
 The Australian dollar rose to its highest since May 11
against the U.S. dollar , as the spread between two-year
Australian and U.S. yields rose to around a two-year high. The

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2010 01:36PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Proposed law seen as new threat to Brazil's Amazon," * Environmentalists fear measure could fuel deforestation
 * Farmers say current law unfair, imperils competitiveness
 * Could pose policy headache for Lula or his successor
 By Stuart Grudgings
 RIO DE JANEIRO, July 26 (Reuters) - A proposed overhaul of
Brazilian forest policy being considered in Congress is raising
concern that the world's largest forest could be left more
vulnerable than in decades to razing by farmers despite recent
progress in protecting it.
 Destruction of the forest, which is a vital global climate
regulator due to the vast amount of carbon it stores as well as
a caldron of biodiversity, is driven mainly by farmers who
clear Amazon land for crops and livestock.
 Supported by the powerful farming lobby, the proposed
changes to Brazil's 1965 Forest Code would take away important
powers to set forest protection policy from the federal
government and give them to states. Environmentalists say this
would spark a race to laxer standards.
 The measure also would give amnesty to people fined for
violating the current forest code up to 2008 and sharply cut
the amount of land that owners would have to save as forest.
 The legislation could cause problems for President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva or his successor to be chosen in October's
presidential election in which Lula cannot run.
 A special committee in Congress passed the measure this
month. It is expected to be voted on by the full Congress this
year, likely after the elections.
 ""It will be a huge embarrassment for whoever gets into
office,"" said Fabio Scarano, the executive director of the
Conservation International Brazil environmental group.
 ""Environmentally it's a disaster from what science tells
us, and from the agricultural point of view it's also a
disaster. The water they use for irrigation is the water that
is protected by these very reserves. All sides lose,"" Scarano
added.
 Supporters of the bill say it would make Brazil's
agriculture sector more competitive by giving farmers more
access to productive land. They point to language in the bill
that would require a five-year moratorium on new deforestation
as evidence that the measure, if made law, would not herald a
new wave of Amazon destruction.
 Farmers say that stricter protection rules over the years
have left many of them outside the law, even though they
themselves may not have been responsible for clearing the
forest land now used for farming.
 ""The law allows states to legalize their lands. In areas
that are producing and were deforested, states can allow them
to continue producing,"" said Assuero Doca Veronez, head of the
environment commission at Brazil's Confederation of Agriculture
and Cattle. ""The law in no way weakens environmental protection
in the sense of allowing new deforestation.""
 'VERY DANGEROUS'
 Under the bill, farmers in Amazon states would need to keep
only 20 percent of their land as forest, down from 80 percent
now.
 ""The proposed forest code is very dangerous because it
creates the expectation you're always going to have these
amnesties so people can get away with breaking the law,"" said
Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at the National Institute for
Research in the Amazon, a private research institute.
 The fierce debate between environmentalists and farming
interests in Latin America's largest country comes as
destruction of the Amazon has been on a sustained decline.
 The reduction in forest destruction has allowed the
government to argue it is on track to meet a target, which Lula
touted at the global climate summit in Copenhagen last year, of
reducing by 2020 its annual rate of Amazon deforestation by 80
percent from high 1996-2005 levels.
 Preliminary satellite data released last week showed that
deforestation of the Amazon fell 47 percent between August 2009
and May this year compared to the same period a year earlier.
That follows a confirmed 42 percent fall in the 2008-09 period
to 2,900 square miles (7,464 square km).
 Supporters of the legislation say the forest does not need
any more protection than is already provided. But a spike in
commodity prices as the world economy rebounds could stoke more
deforestation as farmers clear more land, Fearnside said.

 By Luke Baker and Robin Pomeroy
 BRUSSELS/TEHRAN, July 26 (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it
was ready to return to talks on a nuclear fuel swap, a surprise
that came shortly after the European Union agreed tougher
sanctions, including a block on oil and gas investment.
 EU foreign ministers approved a range of extra restrictions
on Iran that went well beyond U.N. sanctions agreed last month
and included a ban on dealing with Iranian banks and insurance
companies and steps to prevent investment in Tehran's lucrative
oil and gas sector, including refining.
 Shortly afterwards, Iran said it was prepared to return to
negotiations on a nuclear fuel swap ""without conditions"",
according to the official IRNA news agency.
 Talking of a letter that Iran handed to the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran's envoy to the U.N. agency,
Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said: ""The clear message of this letter
was Iran's complete readiness to hold negotiations over the fuel
for the Tehran reactor without any conditions.""
 The announcement appeared to be an Iranian signal of
willingness to negotiate as a net of U.N., EU and U.S. sanctions
tightens around it, but it was not clear that the quick offer of
fuel swap talks would be enough to placate world powers.
 EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton welcomed Iran's
offer of a return to negotiations but said she wanted to see the
details before commenting further.
 Turkey and Brazil agreed a nuclear fuel swap deal with
Tehran days before the U.N. agreed more sanctions in mid-June,
but this did not stop the major powers -- the United States,
Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- from pushing ahead
with a stringent, fourth round of restrictions on Iran.
 The European Union said on Monday that the aim of its latest
sanctions was to get Iran to return to negotiations over its
uranium enrichment programme, possibly by the end of the year.
 Ashton and Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili,
have exchanged several letters in the past month and EU
diplomats say they could hold talks as soon as September.
 Iran last negotiated with the West over its nuclear
programme in October 2009 but there was no breakthrough.
 The question is whether Iran will agree that new talks can
look at the possibility of stopping its enrichment programme --
which Western powers believe is aimed at developing nuclear
weapons -- or whether it will try to focus them on a fuel swap,
without any commitment to halting uranium enrichment.
 Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes
only, with medical and energy applications, not for weapons.
 
 EU TAKES EXTRA STEPS
 The EU restrictions, expected legally to come into force on
Tuesday, focus on preventing oil and gas investment, stopping
dealings with Iranian banks and insurance companies, and
stemming financial transfers.
 ""The longer (Iran) refuses to talk ... about its nuclear
programme, the greater the pressure and isolation Iran will
bring on itself,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said.
 ""But Iran does have a choice: Britain and the international
community stand ready to engage, and still believe that the way
forward on this issue is multilateral negotiation.""
 Perhaps the hardest-hitting element of the sanctions is the
move to prohibit new investment in and technical assistance to
Iran's refining, liquefaction and liquefied natural gas sectors
which are a mainstay of its energy-based economy.
 There is a broad clampdown on the ""supply, sale or transfer
of items, materials, equipment, goods and technology"" that could
have ""dual-use"" purposes, including software, and restrictions
on financial transfers and bond sales or purchases.
 
 PRESSURE AND DIPLOMACY
 The broadened sanctions are intended to put financial
pressure on Iran, which is the world's fifth largest crude oil
exporter but has little refining capacity and has to import
about 40 percent of its gasoline needs for domestic consumption.
 Traders said this month Iran was depending more on friendly
countries for fuel supplies to sidestep sanctions intended to
hinder its fuel imports, and was buying about half of its July
gasoline imports from Turkey and the rest from Chinese sellers.
 Only three cargoes of gasoline have so far reached Iran this
month, according to shipping documents seen by Reuters, a sign
that sanctions are biting. Because Iran subsidises fuel for
consumers, pump prices will not be affected.
 While China, Turkey, Malaysia and others may now step in to
furnish Iran with goods it will no longer be able to get from
the European Union, analysts said the EU sanctions were
well-enough designed to ensure they would be effective.
 ""Most of the sectors that have been targeted in the EU
sanctions are ones over which Europeans have a substantial
leverage,"" Mark Fitzpatrick, an Iran specialist at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters.
 ""Not so many other countries can provide the kind of
financial services that will be cut off. Few other countries
supply technology for liquefied natural gas, nobody else does
re-insurance ... The European Union has very wisely found areas
over which it has real leverage and cannot be supplanted.""

 * Euro up versus dollar on upbeat European data
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Monday after
U.S. data showed a pick-up in new home sales, reviving hopes
for improvement in a tepid economic recovery, while the euro
firmed against the dollar on increased risk tolerance.
 The euro climbed to $1.30, the highest since July 20, and
also received a boost as investors reacted to results of tests
of European banks' health released late on Friday.
 Sales of single-family homes in June jumped 23.6 percent,
the largest increase since May 1980, from the prior month's
record low, pushing U.S. Treasury prices lower and supporting
oil prices. For details, see [ID:nN23137243]
 ""There was a big revision down in the prior month, but then
obviously a rebound this month. We're still at these trough
levels, which we've been bouncing along. It's a good sign that
we did see an increase after the tax credit expired,"" Michael
O'Rourke, chief market strategist at BTIG LLC, New York.
 O'Rourke referred to an Obama administration tax break to
home buyers to stimulate the economy, which has now expired.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 67.06
points, or 0.65 percent, at 10,491.90. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 9.37 points, or 0.85 percent, at
1,112.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 18.67
points, or 0.82 percent, at 2,288.14.
 U.S. stocks also got a lift from FedEx Corp  after
the bellwether raised its earnings outlook, sending its stock
up more than 4 percent. Stronger outlooks for transportation
firms like FedEx are seen as a sign of growing economic
demand.
 European shares closed at a five-week high, helped by the
U.S. housing data, with the banking sector among the top
performers following the bank stress test results.
 The tests were aimed partly at opening the door to funding
markets for a batch of southern European banks and lowering
costs for other lenders. [ID:nLDE66N02E]
 Seven out of 91 banks failed the test, including five from
Spain and another 17 barely passed the EU tests which have been
widely criticised as not demanding enough.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed 0.4 percent higher at 1,048 points.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were up 1
percent and the Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> gained 0.93 percent.
 After Friday's release of the European bank stress test
results and Monday's strong U.S. housing data for June, the
euro  rose to $1.30 against the dollar, the highest since
July 20, on electronic trading platform EBS.
 Investors were upbeat about a series of reports in the past
week showing the broader European economy was stronger than
thought.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.45
percent at 87.05, paring some of its losses after the U.S.
housing data.
 Purchasing managers' indexes indicated third-quarter euro
zone growth of around 0.6-0.7 percent. German business
sentiment also posted a record jump in July to its highest
level in three years. And Britain, not in the euro zone, added
to the mix with an economy growing twice as fast as expected in
the second quarter.
 ""Despite the market's single-minded focus on the stress
tests, the more important story was the surprisingly strong
economic data from the region (last week),"" said Boris
Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT in New
York.
 U.S. Treasuries fell after the improvement in new home
sales data. Benchmark 10-year note  was down 6/32,
with the yield at 3.0196 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note
 was down 2/32, with the yield at 0.6127 percent. The
30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down 16/32, with the
yield at 4.0481 percent.
 U.S. crude oil prices turned positive after the economic
data having been pressured earlier on Tropical Storm Bonnie's
fade from the Gulf of Mexico.
Oil  was trading at around $79 a barrel, flat after
rising on the U.S. housing data. The price of gold  fell
$6.45, or 0.54 percent, to $1182.10, as the metal lost some of
its safe-haven appeal, while European stress test results,
robust U.S. company earnings and vigorous euro zone data cut
into gold's appeal.

 * EU foreign ministers target Iranian oil, gas investment
 * Iran says ready to return to negotiations on fuel swap
 * Gasoline imports to Iran fall as sanctions tighten
 
 By Luke Baker and Robin Pomeroy
 BRUSSELS/TEHRAN, July 26 (Reuters) - Iran said unexpectedly
on Monday that it was prepared to return to talks on a nuclear
fuel swap, shortly after the European Union agreed tougher
sanctions including action to block oil and gas investment. 
 EU foreign ministers approved a range of extra restrictions
on Iran that went well beyond U.N. sanctions agreed last month,
including measures to block dealing with Iranian banks and
insurance companies and steps to prevent investment in Tehran's
lucrative oil and gas sector, including refining.
 Shortly afterwards, Iran said it was ready to return to
negotiations on a nuclear fuel swap ""without conditions"",
according to the official IRNA news agency.
 Talking of a letter that Iran handed to the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran's envoy to the U.N. agency,
Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said: ""The clear message of this letter
was Iran's complete readiness to hold negotiations over the fuel
for the Tehran reactor without any conditions.""
 The announcement appeared to be a move by Iran to show
willingness to negotiate as a net of U.N., EU and U.S. sanctions
tightens around it, but it was not clear that the quick offer of
fuel swap talks would be enough to placate world powers.
 ""This is the time (for Iran's adversaries) to prove that
they also are determined to come from confrontation and
negotiation and to talks,"" Soltanieh told Iran's Press TV, but
went on to note Iran's displeasure at the new EU sanctions.
 ""Having said that, it is disappointing that there is news
about the negative destructive gestures which jeopardises the
conducive environment,"" he added. 
 Turkey and Brazil agreed a nuclear fuel swap deal with
Tehran days before the new U.N. sanctions were imposed, but this

(Adds pollster quotes, detail, background)
By Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, July 26 (Reuters) - Support for Hungary's ruling
centre-right Fidesz party has slipped since it took power in May
and ended aid talks with the IMF but it still maintained its
position as the country's strongest party by far.
 The strong support indicates that while Fidesz has picked
fights with international lenders and its political rivals,
voters approve of its tough stance, the director of Szazadveg
Institute, which conducted the poll, said.
 ""People are much more supportive of a decisive government
than of the alternatives offered by either the Socialists or the
far right,"" Andras Giro-Szasz told Reuters.
 ""The government managed to capitalise on every measure it
took, in national as well as financial policy. The opposition
parties are fighting for second place, with no real message.""
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban's cabinet has stoked market
worries as it refused to accept demands from its international
lenders to lower a big tax on financial institutions this year
or to abandon plans to cut salaries at the central bank.
 The lenders, which bailed Hungary out with a $25.1 billion
emergency loan in 2008, left without concluding a regular review
earlier this month, sending Hungary's assets tumbling.
[ID:nLDE66I054]
 The country's forint  has weakened 8.5 percent
against the euro since Fidesz won the elections in April.
 Moody's and S&P both warned on Friday they might downgrade
Hungary's debt citing the IMF snub. [ID:nLDE66M0U9]
 Szazadveg said on Monday that voters continued to back
Fidesz, which had the support of 64 percent of decided voters,
down slightly from 70 percent in the last poll, which was
conducted in June by the Tarki institute.
 Support for the main opposition Socialists was 16 percent in
Szazadveg's poll, up from 13 percent of decided voters measured
by Tarki in June. 
 Among all voters, Fidesz held onto its 46 percent support,
while the Socialists had the backing of 12 percent of voters, up
from 10 percent in June.
 The far-right Jobbik party, which analysts say makes Fidesz
more confrontational on policy, scored 10 percent among decided
voters and 8 percent among all voters, in line with Tarki's
earlier poll. [ID:nLDE66K18Y]

informal talks with Malaysia on a free trade pact that could
open markets in spirits, cars and services to Europe and bring
more investment to the Southeast Asian country, diplomats said.
 The move highlights the EU's resolve to tap Asian consumer
and financial markets. EU trade experts expressed their interest
in securing a deal with Malaysia at a meeting in Brussels on
Friday, diplomats said.
 One envoy said informal talks had also been held between EU
and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur several weeks ago.
 ""Initial talks are moving along rather quickly, and the
question is whether Malaysia is ready to get involved in a very
comprehensive agreement,"" said one source.
 Malaysian officials in Brussels confirmed that formal trade
talks could start but gave no details. If they do start,
Malaysia would be the third Southeast Asian nation after
Singapore and Vietnam to hold talks with the EU this year.
 The EU had hoped to secure an agreement with the Association
of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which comprises 10
countries including Malaysia, but talks with the group were
frozen last year. This opened the way to talks with individual
ASEAN states.
 The EU's trade with the countries that make up ASEAN reached
175 billion euros in 2008. Only China and the United States are
bigger trading partners for the EU.
 EU diplomats say exporters want Malaysian trade barriers cut
on wines, spirits, cars and financial services. They also want
rules allowing EU business executives to work in Malaysia.
 Malaysia has high duties protecting its wines and spirits
sector. Its government vowed last year to retain excise duties
to protect local car maker Proton but is also looking for
foreign investors as the firm faces mounting competition.

 ATHENS, July 26 (Reuters) - Shares in state-controlled Greek
lenders Hellenic Postbank (TT) and ATEbank rose sharply on
Monday as Greek bank stocks outperformed European benchmarks on
growing talk of consolidation and overall positive stress test
results.
 Earlier this month, Piraeus Bank offered to buy 77.3 percent
in ATEbank and 33 percent in Hellenic Postbank from the
government for 701 million euros in cash, sparking a rally in
the country's banking sector.
 ""There is speculative volume following the stress tests,
with the market looking forward to what may take place on the
consolidation front after Piraeus Bank's offer,"" said a broker
who did not want to be named. ""There is talk other banks may
make a move for TT.""
 Traders said there was speculation in the market that a
merger of the three will be followed by other moves to form
larger entities or counteroffers by competing banks.
 Greek bank stocks ended the session with gains of 4.59
percent, outperforming European peers which rose 1.57 percent.
 Shares in Hellenic Postbank (TT), which emerged with the
highest Greek score in pan-European stress tests, closed 16.7
percent higher at 3.9 euros, while Piraeus was up 3.1 percent at
4.6 euros.
 Shares in ATEbank, which was the only Greek bank to fail the
stress test, as expected, gained 6.0 percent to 1.06 euros,
benefitting from the merger talk.
 ""Given the challenging environment in Greece and
significantly stricter assumptions for probabilities of default
and loan losses compared with European peers, the fact that
seven out of eight Greek/Cypriot banks passed (the stress tests)
is undeniably positive,"" said UBS analyst Alexander Kyrtsis in a
note.
 Since Piraeus announced its bid for stakes in the two banks
on July 15, Greek banks have gained 15 percent, including
Monday's climb. They are still down 35 percent year-to-date, hit
by the country's debt crisis.

 (Adds comments, details. Updates prices)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Monday as relief over European bank stress tests and
stronger economic data on both sides of the Atlantic took some
risk aversion off the table.
 However, worries the tests weren't strict enough capped
gains in the single currency.
 The dollar pared some of its earlier losses against the
Japanese yen after a government report showed better than
expected new home sales in in June. For details, see But demand
for the yen remained high.
 Analysts said Monday's new home sales report was a ""good
surprise"" after a string of lackluster data but more evidence
was needed to reassure investors the economic recovery in the
U.S. was still on track.
 ""The data was pretty surprising, especially considering how
poor the numbers were last month. But the jury really is still
out,"" said John Doyle, senior currency strategist, at Tempus
Consulting, in Washington.
 ""Unless you see a continued pattern of positive numbers, I
think traders are going to be skeptical,"" he added. ""That's why
the dollar reaction has been pretty muted.""
 In late morning trading in New York, the dollar was 0.2
percent lower at 87.25 yen, but up from session low of 86.83
yen hit before the release of the housing data.
 Meanwhile, positive economic data in Europe has helped
lift the single currency recently.
 ""Despite the market's single-minded focus on the stress
tests the more important story was the surprisingly strong
economic data from the region (last week),"" said Boris
Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT in New
York.
 Fear of a euro zone debt crisis and its impact on European
banks drove the euro below $1.19 last month, its lowest level
since 2006, but it began a swift recovery in July and hit a
10-week high above $1.30 last week.
 That was partly driven by data showing the euro zone
economy has been holding up better than anticipated, even as
governments tighten their belts to reign in large deficits.
 Relief over the results of the tests, which only seven of
91 banks failed, helped push the euro 0.2 percent higher
against the dollar at $1.2935. But the currency came off a
session high of $1.2958. For more on the tests see.
 PUSH TOWARDS $1.31
 Technical analysts said the euro may still push towards
$1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement of the December to June
move. To do that, however, it would need to sustain a move
above $1.30, a level it has not retested since hitting a
10-week high around $1.3028 early last week.
 The euro's downside was also seen limited while it remained
above support at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average -- and
last week's low around $1.2730, leaving it hemmed in within a
range for the time being.
 Some said the euro's gains could also be constrained by
this week's redemption of maturing euro zone bonds and coupon
payments worth some 45 billion euros, according to Citi

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the
dollar on Monday but was below early highs as investors
speculated European bank stress tests weren't strict enough to
support a rally in the euro zone single currency.
 Demand for the yen rose as appetite for risk faded, with
European shares sliding and U.S. stock futures lower. Still,
analysts said euro gains may not wane completely as recent data
in the region had been supportive for the currency.
 ""Despite the market's single-minded focus on the stress
tests the more important story was the surprisingly strong
economic data from the region (last week),"" said Boris
Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT in New
York.
 Fear of a euro zone debt crisis and its impact on European
banks drove the euro below $1.19 last month, its lowest level
since 2006, but it began a swift recovery in July and hit a
10-week high above $1.30 last week.
 That was partly driven by data showing the euro zone
economy has been holding up better than anticipated, even as
governments tighten their belts to reign in large deficits.
 Relief over the results of the tests, which only seven of
91 banks failed, helped push the euro 0.2 percent higher
against the dollar at $1.2923. But the currency came off a
session high of $1.2958.
 Technical analysts said the euro may still push towards
$1.3125, the 38.2 percent retracement of the December to June
move. To do that, however, it would need to sustain a move
above $1.30, a level it has not retested since hitting a
10-week high around $1.3028 early last week.
 The euro's downside was also seen limited while it remained
above support at $1.2870 -- its 100-day moving average -- and
last week's low around $1.2730, leaving it hemmed in within a
range for the time being.
 Some said the euro's gains could also be constrained by
this week's redemption of maturing euro zone bonds and coupon
payments worth some 45 billion euros, according to Citi
estimates.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
currency speculators cut net short positions in the euro. Net
shorts fell to 24,251 contracts in the week to July 20 compared
with 27,050 in the prior week.
 ""The stress tests failed to inspire much of a euro/dollar

 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, July 26 (Reuters) - The European Union imposed
tighter sanctions on Iran over its disputed nuclear programme on
Monday, approving measures to block oil and gas investment and
curtail Tehran's refining and natural gas capability.
 The restrictions go well beyond sanctions imposed by the
United Nations last month and mirror steps taken by the United
States this month to apply extra pressure on Tehran to return to
negotiations over its uranium enrichment programme.
 The measures include widespread limits on dealings with
Iranian banks and insurance companies and were accompanied by a
call from EU foreign ministers for Iran to resume talks over its
enrichment work, which Western powers see as a covert quest for
nuclear weapons. Iran says it is for peaceful purposes only.
 Diplomats conceded that the sanctions' impact will depend on
steps to enforce them fully, a problem in the past.
 A spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry dismissed the
EU's new restrictions, saying they would not affect Iran.
 ""Sanctions will only further complicate the conditions and
they will have no impact,"" Ramin Mehmanparast was quoted as
saying by the official news agency IRNA.
 ""One should think about the necessity of cooperation by all
countries in resolving the global crisis.""
 Britain, which with France and Germany has been the heart of
the push for extra Iran sanctions, welcomed the EU's move.
 ""The message to the Iranian Government could not be clearer:
the longer it refuses to talk ... about its nuclear programme,
the greater the pressure and isolation Iran will bring upon
itself,"" Foreign Secretary William Hague said.
 ""But Iran does have a choice: Britain and the international
community stand ready to engage, and still believe that the way
forward on this issue is multilateral negotiation.""
 The extra sanctions, which also limit dealings with Iran's
state shipping company and with air cargo flights, will not
legally come into force until they are published in the European
Union's official journal on Tuesday, diplomats said.
 Perhaps the hardest-hitting element of the sanctions is the
move to prohibit new investment in and technical assistance to
Iran's refining, liquefaction and liquefied natural gas sectors
which are a mainstay of Iran's energy-based economy.
 There is a broad clampdown on the ""supply, sale or transfer
of items, materials, equipment, goods and technology"" that could
have ""dual-use"" -- civilian or military -- purposes, including
software, and curbs on financial transfers and bond sales or
purchases.

 PRESSURE AND DIPLOMACY ALIKE
 The broadened sanctions are intended to apply financial heat
on Iran, which is the world's fifth largest crude oil exporter
but has little refining capability and has to import around 40
percent of its gasoline needs for domestic consumption.
 Traders said this month Iran was depending more on friendly
countries for fuel supplies to sidestep sanctions intended to
hinder its fuel imports, and was buying about half of its July
gasoline imports from Turkey and the rest from Chinese sellers.
 Only three cargoes of gasoline have so far reached Iran this
month, however, according to shipping documents seen by Reuters,
a sign that sanctions are biting. Because Iran subsidises fuel
for consumers, pump prices will not be affected.
 While China, Turkey, Malaysia and others may now step in to
furnish Iran with goods it will no longer be able to get from
the European Union, analysts said the EU sanctions were
well-enough designed to ensure they would be effective.
 ""Most of the sectors that have been targeted in the EU
sanctions are ones over which Europeans have a substantial
leverage,"" Mark Fitzpatrick, an Iran specialist at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters.
 ""Not so many other countries can provide the kind of
financial services that will be cut off. Few other countries
supply technology for liquefied natural gas, nobody else does
re-insurance ... The European Union has very wisely found areas
over which it has real leverage and cannot be supplanted.""
 As part of its ""dual-track"" approach that twins sanctions
and diplomacy, the EU is also hoping that Iran will agree to
resume negotiations last carried out in October 2009.
 The EU foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, and Iran's
chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, have exchanged letters
in the last few weeks and it looks possible that they will meet
for talks as early as September, diplomats say.
 Iran experts caution that any resumption of talks -- the
first negotiations with the West since October 2009 -- are
unlikely to produce quick results, instead beginning a lengthy
process of Iran manoeuvring to get sanctions lifted and the West
seeking a moratorium on its uranium enrichment.
 Iran says it has an inalienable, sovereign right to nuclear
energy for civilian purposes and this will not be negotiable.

 * Opponents warn of social, environmental degradation
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, July 26 (Reuters) - Access to Canada's lucrative
public works market is propelling the European Union towards a
free trade pact with Ottawa despite fears a deal could swamp
Europe with cheap goods or erode environmental rules in Canada.
 Meetings in Brussels between the EU and Canada this month
ran longer than expected as negotiators considered allowing
European bids for public works contracts in Canada worth an
estimated 100 billion Canadian dollars ($96.53 billion) a year.
 Both sides say a deal is possible by the end of next year.
Negotiators are due to meet for their next round of negotiations
in Canada in October.
 ""The stakes here are very high and very significant,"" said
Canadian International Trade Minister Peter Van Loan, who toured
eastern European states this month to promote trade talks.
 ""Even a small gain in trade will be big for Canadians,"" he
told Reuters by telephone.)
 At first glance, a Comprehensive and Economic Trade
Agreement between Europe and Canada seems small compared to
Europe's trade negotiations with India, or its trade relations
with the United States and Mexico. 
 But the two sides estimate that a deal would within seven
years generate additional annual income of about 11 billion
euros ($14.2 billion) for the EU and 8 billion euros for Canada.
 European industry wants access to Canada's regional and
local public works contracts, from provincial energy
infrastructure to municipal water works and hospital equipment.
 To Canada, it represents an opportunity to reduce its
dependence on shrinking demand in the United States and capture
sales -- from auto parts and insurance and beef, grain and pork
-- now dominated by the likes of the United States and Asia.
 Canada also stands to clinch pan-European guarantees for its
foreign investment -- a significant part of which pours into
mining operations in eastern Europe.
 
 MADE IN CANADA
 Clouding formal talks among Europeans are fears that a free
trade area with Canada, a member of the North American Free
Trade Agreement with the United States and Mexico, will create a
corridor for cheap non-Canadian foods and goods to flood into
Europe and put local producers out of business. 
 To guard against this, European negotiators are demanding
Canadian exporters respect European rather than Canadian rules
that determine whether an export qualifies for tax-free status.
 Beef exporters, for instance, would have to prove their
cattle was born, raised and sourced in Canada. 
 Auto makers such as Ford Motor and Ontario-based Magna
International Inc, whose products cross the Canada-U.S. border
several times, would have to show Canadian labour added a
certain percentage of value to the final product.
 A final agreement is likely to result in hundreds of
individual rules for export products, a prospect Canadian
negotiators say is worthwhile given the prospects for exports. 
 ""We hope this will create an opportunity to win some of the
U.S. and other countries' market share in Europe,"" said Maurice
Bitran, lead negotiator for Ontario province, which is home to
large parts of Canada's car industry.
 ""If we get something in the order of one to three percent of
EU consumption, that's certainly something that's value enough
for our industry,"" said Daryl Hanak, chief negotiator for the
cattle-rich province of Alberta.
 
 MOUNTING OPPOSITION
 Opposition is mounting among Canadian activists travelling
to Brussels to garner support from European lawmakers who have
the power to block a deal.
 The activists say opening up public procurement contracts
such as for municipal water works to private providers, or
extending EU drug patents, would erode key social services.
 They say environmental protection could be at risk if Canada
signs new guarantees for European investment in exploiting the
Canadian oil sands -- naturally occurring mixtures of sand or
clay, water and a dense form of petroleum called bitumen.
 ""Members of the European Parliament typically think this is
an uncontentious issue,"" said Larry Brown, National Secretary
for Canada's National Union of Public and General Employees.
""The more we go into detail, the more worried they become.""
 The European Commission, which negotiates trade accords on
behalf of European member states, has dismissed such concerns as
premature. But European businesses have urged its trade
commissioner to secure guarantees for Europe's energy and
pharmaceuticals sectors.
 An EU-Canada accord ""should facilitate opportunities for
cooperation in the energy sector by removing any restrictions to
EU company participation in energy and related projects,""
BusinessEurope, which represents 20 million EU firms, told EU
trade chief Karel De Gucht in a letter this month.
 Beyond international ambitions, a deal could advance
long-standing federal Canadian aims of breaking the hold of
Canada's powerful provinces over local contracts and trade,
according to Canadian observers.
 ""It's an important agreement for European and Canadian
business, and one hopes it will break down some of our
inter-provincial trade barriers,"" said Jason Langrish, director
of the Canada Europe Round Table for Business.
 ""Sometimes it's easier for Canadian politicians to say:
'Brussels made me do it'.""

 LJUBLJANA, July 26 (Reuters) - The Eurogroup chairman
Jean-Claude Juncker said on Monday EU bank stress tests were
done ""in a very professional way"", rejecting criticism that they
had not been harsh enough.
 Juncker also told reporters that economic recovery in the
euro zone remained fragile, with possible downside risks, and
that the time has come for monetary consolidation and structural

including six in Spain and Greece, for an overall capital

 But the unprecedented health check of European banks was
quickly criticised as being too soft.
 Juncker urged all 91 banks included in the test to publish
details of their results as ""this would add to credibility of
their operation"". 
 He said recovery in the euro zone was under way but added:
""This recovery remains fragile, there are remaining downward

 He said euro zone fundamentals were better than those in the
United States or Japan, and euro zone exit strategy had to be
combined with structural reforms, which he said were a necessity
rather than an option.
 ""In all our (euro group) countries... time for (monetary)
consolidation has come.""
 He declined to comment on the recent euro rebound.
 ""Don't pay too high attention to the volatity of the
exchange rate because the volatility is in fact a phenomenon we
should try to avoid, what is important are the economic
fundamentals,"" Juncker said.

 * EU imports of affected goods totalled $11 billion in 2007
 GENEVA, July 26 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organisation panel
has ruled that the European Union was wrong to impose duties on
three types of electronics products from the United States and
other countries, trade sources said on Monday.
 The WTO panel backed the United States as well as Japan and
Taiwan in their complaint that EU duties on flat-panel displays,
multifunction printers and television set-top boxes violated the
WTO's Information Technology Agreement (ITA).
 That 1996 agreement eliminated duties among a group of 72
participating countries on goods like computer screens and
printers to promote trade in high-tech products.
 But the European Union argued that added functionality meant
some of these products were now also consumer goods not covered
by the agreement rather than information technology products and
therefore should not benefit from the lower duties.
 As a result, it imposed duties ranging from 6 to 14 percent
on the three products. EU imports of the three products from all
suppliers totalled about $11 billion in 2007.
 ""Most of our arguments were accepted by the panel,"" said an
official from one of the complaining countries. 
 The WTO panel issued the panel report on a confidential
basis to the parties in the dispute on Friday. On Saturday,
officials in Taiwan said the ruling would save exporters of
flat-screen tariffs up to $611 million a year.
 Major flat screen makers in Asia include South Korea's
Samsung Electronics and LG Display and Taiwan's AU Optronics
.
 The report will be published around the end of August when
it has been translated into other WTO official languages, after
which the EU has 60 days in which to appeal.
 There was no official comment from the four parties to the
dispute.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro erased early gains
against the dollar on Monday as caution set in after initial
investor calm in the wake of the release of European banks'
stress test results late on Friday.
 Early risk-taking sentiment faded, with European shares down
0.4 percent by mid-morning.
 Just seven of 91 banks failed the tests, including six in
Spain and Greece, for an overall capital shortfall of 3.5
billion euros.
 ""Any downside lurch has been prevented by the generally
reassuring conclusions of the tests ... no surprises as to the
vulnerabilities, and no real headache in terms of the required
capitalisation to bolster their position,"" said Daragh Maher,
deputy head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole CIB.
 ""At the same time, any relief rally for the euro has been
curtailed by inevitable criticism about some of the deficiencies
of the stress test assumptions.""
 By 0844 GMT, the euro was flat compared with late U.S. trade
on Friday at $1.2900, falling from a session high of $1.2958.
 He added the euro may make a push towards $1.3125, the 38.2
percent retracement of the December to June move, but a rise to
that level would attract reversal plays in the pair.
 Near-term support was seen around $1.2870, its 100-day
moving average.
 Some said the euro's gains could be restricted by this
week's redemption of maturing euro zone bonds and coupon
payments worth some 45 billion euros, according to Citi
estimates.
 The euro hit a 10-week high above $1.30 last week,
recovering after fears of a euro zone debt crisis and its impact
on European banks drove it below $1.19 in early June.
 Brighter economic data in the euro zone also bolstered the
single currency.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
currency speculators cutting net short positions in the euro.
Net shorts fell to 24,251 contracts in the week to July 20
compared with 27,050 in the prior week.
 
 YEN GAINS
 The yen gained broadly as investors stepped back from
risk-taking.
 The euro hit a seven-week high of 113.49 yen as dealers
unwound long yen positions, but then ran into offers from
Japanese exporters around 113.30/50 yen which took it lower. It
was last down 0.3 percent at 112.50 yen.
 That helped pull the dollar down 0.3 percent against the yen
to 87.16 yen.
 The dollar was expected to remain under pressure after
recent U.S. housing and manufacturing data suggested recovery
may be fizzling out. Economists have steadily marked down
forecasts for Friday's U.S. second quarter gross domestic
product.
 ""The dollar will remain weak on the back of weaker U.S.
economic data and on the lack of a credit event,"" said Hans
Redeker, global head of FX strategy at BNP Paribas, he said.
 The dollar index was flat at 82.50.
 The Australian dollar came off fresh 10-week high of $0.8990

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Robust U.S. company earnings and
surprisingly vigorous euro zone economic data generally trumped
investor scepticism about European bank stress tests on Monday
to support global stocks including banks.
 Emerging market stocks hit a 2-1/2 month high although Wall
Street looked set to open mildly lower after solid gains on
Friday.
 There was weakness on European bourses, but banking stocks
<.SX7P>, the key test, were up a third of a percent on the first
trading day after the release of stress tests, which showed most
financial institutions to be in relatively good shape.
[ID:nLDE66M1T3]
 There was still concern that the tests were not tough -- by
not considering sovereign debt default, for example -- but
investors appeared content with the results.
 The cost of insuring bank debt against default was cheaper,
with the Markit iTraxx Senior Financials composite narrowing 2.5
basis points. Euribor interbank lending rates were barely
changed.
 ""We interpret the bank stress test as positive. Disclosure
is help not hindrance, therefore, we are overweight on banks. We
do not expect a double-dip,"" said Gary Baker, head of European
strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 Underlying investor sentiment has been lifted by a series of
reports in the past week showing the broader European economy to
be stronger than thought.
 Purchasing managers' indexes indicated third-quarter euro
zone growth of around 0.6-0.7 percent, double the 0.3 percent
forecast in the most recent Reuters poll. German business
sentiment also posted a record jump in July to its highest level

 Non-euro zone member Britain added to the mix with an
economy growing twice as fast as expected in the second quarter.
 Wall Street also weighed in with some bullish news on
Friday, when U.S. conglomerate General Electric  increased
its quarterly dividend by 20 percent.
 The wide-ranging impact GE has on the U.S. economy, coupled
with another round of strong earnings, bolstered investor
confidence.

 EURO FIRMS
 The euro erased most of its early gains against the dollar
as caution set in and early risk-taking sentiment faded a bit.
 ""Any downside lurch has been prevented by the generally
reassuring conclusions of the tests ... no surprises as to the
vulnerabilities, and no real headache in terms of the required
capitalisation to bolster their position,"" said Daragh Maher,
deputy head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole CIB.
 ""At the same time, any relief rally for the euro has been
curtailed by inevitable criticism about some of the deficiencies
of the stress test assumptions."" [ID:nLDE66M1FF]
 The euro was flat compared with late U.S. trade on Friday at
$1.2900 , falling from a session high of $1.2958.
 Euro zone government debt was mixed, with short-term bonds
selling off. 
 ""We doubt ... that the stress test results will have a
lasting impact on fixed income valuations, especially given the
heightened focus on macro economic fundamentals,"" said Jamie
Searle, analyst at Citi.
 ""The market will be watching for any further signs that
double-dip concerns are overblown following Friday's strong
German IFO and UK GDP numbers.""

 LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro firmed against the
dollar on Monday as investors bought into riskier assets, calmed
after the release of European banks' stress test results late on
Friday.
 Just seven of 91 banks failed the tests, including in Spain
and Greece, for an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion
euros.
 While some criticism of the credibility of the tests
persisted, no new bad news emerged and traders seemed ready to
put the event behind them.
 German government bonds fell in early trade, with some
relief that the stress tests were out of the way, and European
shares tracked gains on Wall Street and Asia.
 ""The market assumes that we'll see a positive reaction to
the stress tests, and CDS (credit default swap) spreads and such
will come down,"" said Hans Redeker, global head of FX strategy
at BNP Paribas.
 ""The dollar will remain weak on the back of a weaker U.S.
economic data and on the lack of a credit event."" He said the
market was being driven more by yield differentials between the
United States and Europe, which had narrowed.
 By 0710 GMT, the euro rose 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade
on Friday to $1.2940. It rose as high as $1.2958 after breaching
offers near $1.2950, traders said.
 Near term support is seen around $1.2870, its 100-day moving
average.
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
currency speculators cutting down net short positions in the
euro. Net shorts fell to 24,251 contracts in the week to July 20
compared with 27,050 in the prior week..
 
 EURO GAINS LIMITED?
 The euro hit a 10-week high above $1.30 last week,
recovering after fears of a euro zone debt crisis and its impact
on European banks drove it below $1.19 in early June.
 Brighter economic data in the euro zone also bolstered the
single currency.
 But some said further gains in the euro may be limited.
 ""Friday's stress test results are unlikely to provide any
significant support given lingering concerns over a European
banking system that is manifestly still reliant on European
Central Bank liquidity,"" UBS analysts said in a note.
 Against the yen, the euro hit a seven-week high of 113.49
yen as dealers unwound long yen positions. It was last flat at
113.04 yen.
 Better risk tolerance lifted higher-yielding currencies,
with the Australian dollar striking a fresh 10-week high of
$0.8990. The Aussie now has resistance at $0.9000, with support
seen at $0.8895 ahead of $0.8860.
 Sterling also hit a three-month high of $1.5502.
 The dollar remained under pressure after recent U.S. housing
and manufacturing data has suggested recovery may be fizzling.
Economists have steadily marked down forecasts for Friday's U.S.
second quarter gross domestic product.
 The dollar index fell 0.2 percent at 82.31. The dollar
inched up 0.1 percent versus the yen to 87.32 yen.
 Tokyo's Nikkei stock average gained 0.8 percent after the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose above 1,100 on Friday as
General Electric raised its dividend and Honeywell posted
better-than expected results.

volume in Tokyo rose 15.7 percent this year from a year earlier,
thanks to the rising popularity of FX margin trading among
Japanese individual investors, a survey by a banking industry
group showed on Monday.
 Foreign currency transactions at 20 major banks in Tokyo,
including both Japanese and foreign institutions, amounted to
$294.1 billion per day on average in April 2010, compared to
$254.2 billion in April a year earlier, said the Tokyo Foreign
Exchange Market Committee, a group of forex market players.The
figures include trading in spot, swaps, forwards and options.
 Volume slumped in 2009 from 2008 as banks cut back on trading
after the global credit crisis and has yet to recover to its 2008
level, when there was average daily turnover of $302.5 billion.
 Still, increasing flows from Japanese margin traders boosted
bank trading with customers to a record high of $69.3 billion per
day on average, up 42.9 percent from $48.5 billion in 2009,
helping to lift overall trade.
 ""We think the growth reflected an increase in margin
trading,"" Akira Hoshino, chair of the Committee, told reporters.
 In terms of currency pairs, the dollar/yen remained the most
heavily traded, with daily average turnover of $184.0 billion, or
more than 60 percent of the entire market. The volume was up 16.4
percent from a year earlier.
 That was followed by euro/dollar at $27.1 billion, which
climbed 13.3 percent annually.
 The euro/yen came third with $25.7 billion, increasing 52.8

* Japan needs easier monetary policy - Your Party leader
 * Warns Japan could become ""third-rate"" country
 * Party could become key government ally
 * Also wants weaker yen
(Adds more Watanabe comments, background)
 TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - Japan's government needs to
weaken the yen and adopt more expansionary monetary policies to
beat deflation, according to the leader of a small opposition
party which is being seen as a possible government ally.
 ""What's needed to beat deflation is easier monetary policy,
aggressive fiscal policy and policy that promotes a weaker
yen,"" Yoshimi Watanabe, head of Your Party, told a news
conference on Monday.
 ""As long as we leave the fight against deflation to
bureaucrats, we cannot get away from debilitating deflation and
Japan will eventually become a third-rate country.""
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan is expected to seek cooperation
with Your Party and fellow opposition party New Komeito on
various policies as he tries to avoid political deadlock after
defeat in recent upper house elections.
 Kan's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and its small ally,
the People's New Party, lost their combined majority in the
upper chamber of parliament after Kan floated a possible
doubling of the 5 percent sales tax to mend the country's
tattered finances.
 The DPJ still controls the more powerful lower house but it
needs help from other parties to push bills through the upper
chamber as it tries to rein in massive public debt and engineer
growth in a rapidly ageing society.
 Watanabe said further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) is also needed to overcome deflation, which has
highlighted persistent weakness in the world's second-largest
economy.
 Analysts, however, doubt that the central bank can do much
more to spur demand. It has kept interest rates near zero since
late 2008 and eased policy last December and again in March,
offering cheap funds to banks.
 Watanabe also said the government needed to weaken the yen
but did not elaborate.
 Your Party Secretary-General Kenji Eda told Reuters last
week the government should not intervene in the currency market
to curb the yen's rise even if that could help ease deflation.
 The euro hit a seven-week high against the yen on Monday,
but the single currency is still down 16 percent from a year
earlier, while the dollar traded at 87.32 yen down 8 percent in
the last 12 months.
 A firmer yen hurts the price competitiveness of Japanese
exports and eats into exporters' overseas revenues when
converted into the Japanese currency. Strong growth in exports
this year has helped to offset stubbornly weak domestic demand,
shoring up the fragile economy.
 Watanabe, a former banking minister under the then-ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, wants laws concerning the BOJ to be
revised to have the central bank share a price stability target
with the government.
 He also said Your Party plans to propose to parliament's
special session in the autumn a bill that promotes
privatisation of Japan Post, which is the world's largest
financial conglomerate with assets of more than $3.4 trillion.
 The Democratic Party and its partner People's New Party aim
to pass a bill to scale back postal privatisation in the same
parliamentary session.
 ""By selling Japan Post shares, we can excavate at least 5
trillion yen and as much as 10 trillion yen in hidden assets,""
Watanabe said. ""What the Democrats are doing is burying back
that asset.""

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro hit a seven-week high
against the yen on Monday as a rise in shares prompted dealers to
unwind long yen positions, but scepticism about the credibility
of the euro zone's bank stress tests limited its gains versus the
dollar.
 Traders said interbank players who had bet the euro would
fall below the key 110 yen level, or an 8 1/2-year low of 107.30
yen reached in late June, were forced to dump their short
positions as upbeat U.S. corporate earnings improved investor
risk appetite, boosting riskier assets.
 Better risk tolerance also lifted higher-yielding currencies,
with the Australian dollar striking a fresh 10-week high of
$0.8982. The Aussie now has resistance at $0.9000, with support
seen at $0.8895 ahead of $0.8860.

after hitting a recent low at 110.02 yen last week,"" said Mitsuru
Sahara, chief manager of FX derivatives trading at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""It looks as if the euro will try 115 yen before falling
towards 110 yen again.""
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to 113.10 yen after climbing as far
as 113.49 yen on trading platform EBS, its highest since early
June. It jumped nearly 0.8 percent on Friday.
 It kept in a tight range against the dollar in Asian trade as
players awaited Europe's reaction to the stress test results.
 Just seven of 91 banks failed the tests, including some in
Greece and Spain, for an overall capital shortfall of 3.5 billion
euros.
 Some considered the conditions too lenient, leading to low
capital requirements and fuelling doubts about the exercise..
 ""On the surface, if anything, you have to take these tests
with a pinch of salt,"" said Jonathan Cavenagh, currency
strategist at Westpac, Sydney.
 ""Sovereign debt problems remain, funding constraints for
their banks are still there and these have the potential to weigh
on the euro.""
 The euro inched up 0.1 percent on the day to $1.2916. Near
term support is seen around $1.2870, its 100-day moving average.
 Speculators have been cutting net short positions in the
euro, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showing

 Fears of a euro zone debt crisis and its impact on European
banks had driven the euro below $1.19 last month, its lowest
since 2006. But it began a swift recovery in July and hit a
10-week high above $1.30 earlier last week.
 That was partly driven by data showing the euro zone economy
has been holding up better than anticipated, even as governments
tighten their belts to rein in large deficits.
 On the other hand, recent U.S. housing and manufacturing data
has suggested a recovery there may be fizzling.

U.S. gross domestic product report.. More signs of a slowdown in

gain, was broadly under pressure.

 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - Japanese exports rose more than
expected in June from a year earlier but the pace of increase
slowed for the fourth straight month, a sign the economic
recovery may lose steam on moderating overseas demand.
 While analysts expected export growth to slow from a sharp
rebound in the first quarter, the yen's recent gains and signs
of a slowdown in big markets such as the United States and China
have heightened uncertainty on the outlook for Japan's
export-reliant economy.
 ""Exports to China may have peaked for now. Shipments to
Europe and the United States can't be relied on either. That
means the key will be whether exports to other Asian nations
sustain momentum,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at
Norinchukin Research Institute.
 ""The impact of recent yen rises will appear with a time lag,
so we'll see it affecting exports in the coming months. I think
the impact will be pretty significant.""
 Exports rose 27.7 percent in June from a year earlier, more
than a median market forecast for a 23.5 percent increase, trade
data from the Ministry of Finance showed on Monday.
 But export growth slowed for the fourth straight month after
peaking in February, when it rose 45.3 percent, boding ill for
an economy heavily reliant on overseas demand. From May, exports
were down 1.8 percent, the second consecutive drop on a
month-on-month basis.
 Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of
Japan's total exports, rose 31.7 percent in June from a year
earlier but that still represented a slowing for the fifth
straight month.
 Exports to China rose 22.0 percent from a year earlier, also
marking the fifth straight month of slowdown.
 The slowdown was particularly noticeable in shipments to the
European Union, with growth shrinking to 9.0 percent from 17.4
percent in May, as the yen's rise against the euro and the
region's debt crisis hurt automobile demand, a MOF official
said.
 But exports to the United States picked up on brisk auto
shipments, as the yen's rise against the dollar had been
relatively gradual.
 ""A strong yen has already started to push down export
prices, but exporters have managed to offset it with surges in
volume,"" said Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities
in Japan.
 The real exports index compiled by the Bank of Japan, used
to assess changes in export volume, edged down 0.4 percent to
mark its first drop in 16 months, but the degree of fall was
modest compared to strong rises in preceding months, indicating
export volumes have held relatively steady.
 ""But the impact of the strong yen will likely become more
visible from July-September as exports to Asia will likely show
no further growth and will not help expand export volumes, while
the U.S. economy's dim outlook keeps the yen on an uptrend,""
Nishioka said.
 Japan's economy expanded 5 percent in the first quarter of
this year after emerging from recession last year, driven by
solid exports to fast-growing emerging Asian nations.
 Some analysts warn that the yen's appreciation may hurt
exports by reducing the competitiveness of Japanese goods sold
overseas, prompting the Bank of Japan to loosen monetary policy
further.
 While yen moves alone are unlikely to trigger an immediate
policy response by the BOJ, sharp yen gains accompanied by stock
market falls deep enough to threaten the economy's recovery
could lead to further monetary easing.
 ""One of the worries for Japan's economy at the moment is the
yen's appreciation. If the yen firms rapidly it could raise
concerns about Japanese companies' profits, thus stocks would be
expected to fall,"" said Tatsushi Shikano, a senior economist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
 ""If the yen firms and stocks fall sharply, the Bank of Japan
may have to take some measures.""

 * Investors sceptical over the tests' credibility
 * Strong U.S. earnings, surprising Europe data buoy markets
 By Kazunori Takada
 SINGAPORE, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro edged up and Asian
shares rose on Monday as solid U.S. corporate earnings and
surprisingly strong euro zone data offset growing scepticism
that stress tests on European banks were not strict enough.
 The upbeat sentiment was expected to carry over to European
markets, with Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's
CAC-40 seen opening up to 1 percent higher in their first
reaction to the bank test results, which were released after
European markets closed on Friday.
 Only seven of 91 banks -- five small Spanish banks,
Germany's state-rescued Hypo Real Estate and Greece's ATEbank
-- failed the tests, for an overall capital shortfall of 3.5
billion euros ($4.5 billion).
 The shortfall was much smaller than the 30-100 billion
euros predicted by markets, although many European banks have
already raised capital during the financial crisis.
 The euro inched up 0.2 percent against the U.S. dollar in
Asian trade to around $1.2944, before paring some of its gains.
 It had risen by a similar margin on Friday as the bank
tests revealed no nasty surprises. The single currency was also
buoyed by strong European data, including a record jump in
German business sentiment in July and a stronger-than-expected
surge in the British economy.
 ""With the results of the stress tests, which had been the
market's big focus, out in the open, downward factors seem to
have run their course for now, even though there's criticism
that those tests might have been too easy,"" said Hiroichi
Nishi, general manager of equity marketing at Nikko Cordial
Securities.
 ""The market will likely rise initially and then move
narrowly awaiting reaction in Europe with market players
keeping an eye on currency moves.""
 Asian stocks outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, after
advancing 1.5 percent on Friday on optimism over U.S. company
earnings.
 Japan's Nikkei outperformed, unofficially closing 0.8
percent higher and extending a 2.3 percent rally in the
previous session. Investors were shifting to focus to a slew of
corporate results from major Japanese exporters such as Sony
and Honda later in the week this week.
 South Korea's benchmark KOSPI firmed 0.6 percent following
stronger-than-expected second-quarter growth data while Hong
Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2 percent.
 U.S. stocks rose about 1 percent on Friday as GE shares
jumped after the conglomerate increased its quarterly dividend
by 20 percent, the latest in a string of bullish news from big
U.S. multinationals which have helped ease concerns that the
global economic recovery may be stalling.

 By Kazunori Takada
 SINGAPORE, July 26 (Reuters) - The euro edged up and Asian
shares rose on Monday as solid U.S. corporate earnings and
surprisingly strong euro zone data offset growing scepticism
that stress tests on European banks were not strict enough.
 The upbeat sentiment was expected to carry over to European
markets, with Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>, Germany's DAX
<.GDAXI> and France's CAC-40 <.FCHI> seen opening up to 1
percent higher in their first reaction to the bank test
results, which were released after European markets closed on
Friday. [ID:nLDE66P01M]
 Only seven of 91 banks -- five small Spanish banks,
Germany's state-rescued Hypo Real Estate [HRXGe.UL] and
Greece's ATEbank  -- failed the tests, for an overall
capital shortfall of 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion).
 The shortfall was much smaller than the 30-100 billion
euros predicted by markets, although many European banks have
already raised capital during the financial crisis.
[ID:nLDE66M1T3] [ID:nLDE66M1A2]
 The euro  inched up 0.2 percent against the U.S.
dollar in Asian trade to around $1.2944, before paring some of
its gains.
 It had risen by a similar margin on Friday as the bank
tests revealed no nasty surprises. The single currency was also
buoyed by strong European data, including a record jump in
German business sentiment in July and a stronger-than-expected
surge in the British economy. [ID:nLDE66M0NL]
 ""With the results of the stress tests, which had been the
market's big focus, out in the open, downward factors seem to
have run their course for now, even though there's criticism
that those tests might have been too easy,"" said Hiroichi
Nishi, general manager of equity marketing at Nikko Cordial
Securities.
 ""The market will likely rise initially and then move
narrowly awaiting reaction in Europe with market players
keeping an eye on currency moves.""
 Asian stocks outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.5
percent, after advancing 1.5 percent on Friday on optimism over
U.S. company earnings.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> outperformed, unofficially closing
0.8 percent higher and extending a 2.3 percent rally in the
previous session. Investors were shifting to focus to a slew of
corporate results from major Japanese exporters such as Sony
<6758.T> and Honda <7267.T> later in the week this week.
 South Korea's benchmark KOSPI <.KS11> firmed 0.6 percent
following stronger-than-expected second-quarter growth data
while Hong Kong's Hang Seng <.HSI> rose 0.2 percent.
[ID:nTOE66P006]
 U.S. stocks rose about 1 percent on Friday as GE 
shares jumped after the conglomerate increased its quarterly
dividend by 20 percent, the latest in a string of bullish news
from big U.S. multinationals which have helped ease concerns

1580,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2010 08:04PM ET</span>",Japan June exports rise 27.7 pct year/year - MOF," TOKYO, July 26 (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose a more than
expected 27.7 percent in June from a year earlier as solid demand
from Asia continued to support the economy, Ministry of Finance
data showed on Monday.
 It was the seventh straight month of increase and was bigger
than a median market forecast for a 23.5 percent gain.
 Imports were up 26.1 percent from a year earlier against a
22.2 percent gain expected.
 Compared with May, exports fell 1.8 percent on a seasonally
adjusted basis.
 Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's
total exports, rose 31.7 percent from a year earlier, while
shipments to the European Union increased 9.0 percent.
 Economists say Europe's debt problems will have little impact
on the Japanese economy as exports to the region account for only
about 10 percent of Japan's total exports.
 The trade balance came to a surplus of 687.0 billion yen
($7.86 billion), up 41.1 percent from a year earlier. That
compared with the median estimate for a 700 billion yen surplus
and a 43.7 percent rise.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2010 04:04PM ET</span>",EU's Juncker says Slovakia may reconsider help to Greece-paper," * EFSF has calmed markets
 * Euro zone should not allow exclusion of members
 * Fiscal consolidation is a necessity
 LJUBLJANA, July 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone member Slovakia
will have strong reasons to reconsider its help to indebted
euro group member Greece, the Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude
Juncker was quoted as saying.
 He also said that June establishment of the euro zone's
emergency loan mechanism, the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF), calmed markets and added that he was against
changing euro zone rules in a way to allow exclusion of euro
members.
 ""I think that Slovakia will have strong reasons to
reconsider its cooperation in the package for Greece,"" Juncker
told Slovenian daily Delo in an interview that will be
published in its Monday edition. He did not elaborate.
 ""If Slovakia would finally decide not to cooperate in
bailing out Greece, the mechanism foresees that other members
can provide its share,"" he added.
 Slovakia, the poorest euro zone member, in July became the
last euro member to sign the EFSF, but its government at the
same time recommended parliament not support providing a
bilateral loan to Greece, part of a separate European bailout
plan for the country.
 Juncker welcomed the EFSF mechanism, saying that ""since
establishment of the mechanism conditions truly calmed down and
the markets again behave rationally.""
 He said he was ""strongly against"" possible changing of euro
zone rules so as to allow countries to leave the zone or be
expelled from it for not abiding by euro group rules.
 ""If we would change the (Lisbon) treaty so as to have a
system that would enable exclusion and exit (from the euro
group), we would introduce an element of constant instability.
Almost every month there would be speculation on who will be
excluded and who will leave the euro group,"" he said.
 He also urged European Union states to reduce public
deficit and debt in a way that would not hurt economic
recovery.
 ""Consolidation of the European public finances is not an
option, it is a necessity. If deficits and public debts remain
high there will be no growth in Europe.
 ""Therefore we have to remove fiscal incentives from
economic flows from 2011 onwards. I hope that states that are
introducing saving programmes would do so without obstructing
economic recovery,"" Juncker said.
 He also said he did not see reasons for credit rating
agencies to have reduced ratings of Portugal and Greece as both
countries introduced ""serious and credible programmes"" of
public finance consolidation.

 * Firms that do not comply could be taken over by state
 QUITO, July 24 (Reuters) - Ecuador will enact a law on
Monday aimed at increasing state control over the country's oil
sector, and that could set the stage for nationalization of
noncomplying companies, President Rafael Correa said.
 The law will govern new contracts the government is
preparing, aimed at increasing state oil revenues.
 Congress had scheduled a debate on the bill for Sunday
evening, but Correa said on Saturday lawmakers have waited too
long to act on his government's proposal. The bill was marked
""urgent,"" meaning Congress had only 30 days to act on the
legislation before it would be automatically enacted.
 ""With this law, petroleum companies that do not abide by
the policies of the state will have their fields nationalized
and they will leave the country,"" the president said during his
regular Saturday television address.
 Oil is Ecuador's top export. Correa's government wants
foreign companies to give up their profit-sharing deals and
become service providers in exchange for a flat fee.
 ""If they (lawmakers) want to meet on Sunday evening, let
them do as they please,"" Correa said. ""But on Monday, in strict
defense of the Constitution, the bill will become the law of
the republic.""
 On Thursday, Ecuador ended French oil company Perenco's
contract for two petroleum blocks and one field, and said
state-run Petroamazonas would take over operating the areas.
 Perenco had been in a lengthy tax dispute with the
government.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2010 02:24PM ET</span>",AU says must replace Western partners with China," * Western loans slowed by conditions and checks
 * AU says friction likely with traditional donors
 
 By Jeremy Clarke
 KAMPALA, July 24 (Reuters) - The African Union said on
Saturday Africa must turn ever more to China for its development
because conditions and checks often stalled the flow of funds
from Western nations and the World Bank.
 Maxwell Mkwezalamba, the AU's economic chief, said Africa
must end its reliance on Western money.
 ""For Africa's development and integration we have depended
on the Western world -- we cannot continue to proceed like
this,"" Mkwezalamba told reporters.
 ""We need to diversify our partners that we work with and
hence for us, working with China is something that we have
welcomed,"" he said at the AU summit in Uganda.
 China pledged last year to give Africa $10 billion in
concessional loans over the next three years and it is pouring
money into developing infrastructure in many nations on the
world's poorest continent.
 Some Western nations say China is interested only in
extracting Africa's natural resources to feed its fast-growing
economy, cares little for African development and supports
governments with dubious human rights records.
 Rights groups say China, which last year imported $6.3
billion of Sudanese crude oil, has failed to do enough to stop
bloodshed in Sudan's strife-torn Darfur and has violated a U.N.
arms embargo on the region. 
 China denies the charges and has appointed its own envoy to
try to bring peace to Darfur. China's Foreign Ministry says
critics who suggest China is only interested in Africa because
of its energy resources are ""erroneous and one-sided"".
 Mkwezalamba said restrictive conditions placed on loans by
some of its traditional Western partners and groups such as the
World Bank was driving African nations into the arms of China.
He did not specify the restrictive conditions.
 ""By getting support from China and other countries we
strengthen our position in dealing with institutions such as the
World Bank, which tend to impose huge conditions,"" he said. ""The
resources tend to come very slowly.""
 ""They tell you that you are going to get $100 million today
but then you don't get the $100 million until after maybe two
years because the whole question of processing the loan takes a
long time,"" he said.
 Mkwezalamba said Africa's increasing outreach to China in
place of traditional development partners would create friction.
 ""We know that there could be some difficulties that some
financial institutions and development institutions may have
with some of these partners (like China), but for Africa I think
this is the way to go,"" he said.
 Some Chinese commentators say the West still treats Africa
like a colony, whereas Beijing's interest is based on mutual
economic development.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2010 06:04AM ET</span>",Obama criticizes Republicans on U.S. economy," * ""Times are tough""
 * Singles out Boehner
 By Steve Holland
 WASHINGTON, July 24 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
criticized Republicans on Saturday for supporting economic
policies that ""created this mess in the first place"" as he
tried to raise election-year doubts about his opponents.
 Obama used his weekly radio and Web address to promote his
own prescriptions for the ailing U.S. economy a day after his
administration projected the U.S. jobless rate could average
9.7 percent this year and 9 percent in 2011.
 He said an overhaul of financial regulations he signed on
Wednesday would help prevent the type of reckless Wall Street
behavior that triggered the 2008 financial meltdown. He said
tax cuts for small businesses and efforts to promote job growth
in the clean energy sector would pay dividends.
 ""Now, I can't tell you that this plan will bring back all
the jobs we lost and restore our economy to full strength
overnight,"" Obama said. But he said the country was heading in
the right direction.
 Americans weary of recession go to the polls on Nov. 2 to
elect 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 37
members of the U.S. Senate. Both parties anticipate Republicans
will pick up seats against Democratic majorities in both
chambers and could win the House.
 Obama singled out House Republican leader John Boehner for
criticism. Boehner wants to repeal and replace Obama's
healthcare overhaul and keep in place tax cuts for wealthy
Americans that expire at the end of the year.
 Some Democrats have also questioned whether those tax cuts
should be allowed to expire at a time of economic stress. The
White House wants to extend tax cuts for the middle class but
end the reductions for the wealthy.
 ""I am confident that we are finally headed in the right
direction,"" Obama said. ""We are moving forward. And what we
can't afford right now is to go back to the same ideas that
created this mess in the first place.""
 A CNN-Opinion Research poll released on Friday said 42
percent of Americans approved of Obama's handling of the
economy, compared with 57 percent who disapproved.
 ""I know times are tough, I know that the progress we've
made isn't good enough for the millions of Americans who are
still out of work or struggling to pay the bills,"" he said.
 He said Americans needed to rekindle a spirit of optimism
to get through a time of great challenge and difficulty and not
be afraid of the future.

 * Only seven European banks fail stress tests
 * Analysts question credibility of tests
 * Global stocks gain, Nasdaq erases 2010 losses
 * Euro recovers late in the session, still fragile
(Updates to U.S. markets' close)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday
on solid corporate earnings while the euro gained against the
dollar after fewer-than-expected European banks failed stress
tests.
 Safe-haven assets such as gold and U.S. Treasuries dropped
after European regulators reported that only seven of 91 banks
failed the tests, which were designed to show the impact of
Europe's sovereign debt crisis on its financial institutions.
 The market recovery seemed fragile, however. Some analysts
questioned the credibility of the tests after regulators
revealed they were applied only to the bank's trading books --
not their banking books.
 Under the worst stress scenario, the seven weaker banks --
five of them from Spain -- would face a capital shortfall of
3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion). For details, see
[ID:nSGE66M07W].
 ""The market expectation was that you were going to have
about 10 bank failures -- two from Germany, one from Greece
and about six from Spain -- and capital shortfalls totaling at
least 100 billion euros,"" said Cary Leahey, an economist at
Decision Economics in New York.
 A larger number of failures, Leahey added, would have
added credibility to the tests.
 Other analysts bet the positive results will calm down
investors and let them focus on some recent positive economic
and corporate data.
 ""Despite questions about transparency and how the Euro
stress tests don't measure up to the U.S. tests last year, I
think these tests will start to put these Euro-zone concerns
behind us,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist with
the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.
 Investors' optimism increased following solid
second-quarter results from major U.S. companies, including
Microsoft and Ford. Data showing Germany's business sentiment
jumped in July to its highest level in three years also
supported markets. [ID:nN21206486] [ID:nN23252485]
[ID:nLDE66M0JV]
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> advanced 0.69 percent in late trading on
Friday.
 Before the stress test results were announced, the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares rose
0.48 percent to close at 1,044.31.
 On Wall Street, each of the three major U.S. stock indexes
finished Friday's session about 1 percent higher with the
Nasdaq edging back into the black for the year. At the close,
the Nasdaq had erased its 2010 losses.
 In early afternoon, the Dow industrials briefly turned
positive for the year and then gave up some of those gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> climbed 102.32
points, or 0.99 percent, to end at 10,424.62 -- just about 4
points shy of its close at the end of 2009. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 8.99 points, or 0.82 percent, to
finish at 1,102.66 -- or about 13 points below its year-end
2009 close.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 23.58 points, or
1.05 percent, to close at 2,269.47.
 Shares of General Electric Co  climbed 3.29 percent
to $15.71 after the company raised its dividend by 20 percent

 Shares of Microsoft  dipped 0.12 percent to close
at $25.81 even after the company's stronger-than-expected
results. Ford's stock  jumped 5.2 percent to $12.72.
 EURO REBOUNDS
 The euro gained 0.19 percent to $1.2913 late in the
afternoon, after a very volatile session. Initially, the euro
had fallen as the results of the stress tests came out.
 Investors remained cautious however, taking the results of
the stress tests with a grain of salt.
 ""There's definitely suspicion out there about these tests,
but the euro is coming off a very good week, thanks to solid
economic data, and that's lending support,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Against the Japanese yen , the greenback gained 0.54
percent to 87.38.
 The dollar, which had lured investors earlier in the
session with its safe-haven appeal, gave up some of those
gains against a basket of major currencies late in the
afternoon. By the end of the day, the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
was down 0.10 percent at 82.516 -- off its session high at
83.028.
 U.S. crude oil futures  fell 32 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $78.98 a barrel. Earlier, U.S. oil
futures reached an 11-week high at $79.60. Oil's decline from
that high tracked the release of the stress test results, but
the market found support in the temporary loss of some Gulf of
Mexico oil production as Tropical Storm Bonnie made its way
across south Florida.
 As stocks gained, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 fell 17/32 in price, with the yield rising to 3
percent.
 U.S. August gold futures  fell $7.80 to settle at
$1,187.80 an ounce as global risk aversion declined.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 OTTAWA, July 23 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar edged
higher against the U.S. currency on Friday for a second
straight session, as investors looked past domestic inflation
data and were heartened by more evidence of confidence in the
economic recovery.
 Some U.S. manufacturers, such as Honeywell International
, raised their 2010 profit forecasts, while General
Electric  boosted its dividend. Both moves were seen as
encouraging signs for a U.S. economy that has recently been
subject to fears of falling back into recession.
[ID:nN2393794]
 Anxiously awaited results from European bank stress tests
also appeared to be taken in stride, though concerns were
raised that the tests were too soft. Seven of 91 European banks
failed the tests to gauge their strength, fewer than expected.
[ID:nLDE66M1T3] [ID:nSGE66M07W]
 These outside influences on the Canadian dollar overtook
domestic inflation data that showed inflation eased in June to
an annual rate of 1.0 percent.
 Moderating energy prices helped to lower Canada's consumer
price index by 0.1 percent in the month from May, suggesting
the Bank of Canada has breathing room to take a gradual
approach to future interest rate hikes. [ID:nN23500487]
 ""(Inflation data) was definitely pushed to the side. Most
of the focus today was on general market confidence,"" said
Darren Richardson, a corporate dealer at CanadianForex, a
commercial foreign exchange firm.
 ""I think overall the (European stress test) results were
okay and the market was taking it on board. We're still very
much range-bound.""
 The Canadian currency  finished at C$1.0361 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.52 U.S. cents, not far from the high of the
week touched on Friday at C$1.0346 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.66
U.S. cents. It finished Thursday's session at C$1.0393 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.22 U.S. cents.
 It had dropped briefly to a session low of C$1.0440 versus
greenback, or 95.79 U.S. cents, after the inflation data but
quickly rebounded as market players figured the overall path
for Canadian interest rates was still up.
 A key technical level to watch is the 100-day moving
average which is C$1.03 to the U.S. dollar, said Steve Butler,
director of foreign exchange trading at Scotia Capital.
 ""We tested it four times last week, couldn't ever get a
close below it, so I think if we can go down to that C$1.0280
to C$1.03 area that will be really important for the downside,""
he said.
 ""Anywhere back up toward that C$1.0560 to C$1.0580 area is
going to be certainly the topside and before we get there I
think we should probably find a little bit of resistance up
toward C$1.05.""
 BOND PRICES SLIDE
 Canadian bond prices fell as riskier assets found favor
from the solid U.S. corporate earning results that helped North
American stock markets make gains.
 The two-year bond  lost 7 Canadian cents to yield

 ""The economy is still struggling; too many Americans are
still out of work; and the nation's long-term fiscal trajectory
is unsustainable,"" the White House said in the annual
midsession review of President Barack Obama's budget.
 Polls show Americans are anxious about the economy and
could punish Obama's Democrats in Nov. 2 midterm congressional
elections for perceptions of big government spending and high
unemployment after a severe recession.
 Investors are also focused on U.S. debt at a time when
European governments are stressing fiscal consolidation. The
White House said the country was on track to meet its June
commitment in Toronto to the Group of 20 to halve the deficit
by 2013.
 The administration trimmed an expected funding gap in the
current fiscal year by $84 billion, to $1.47 trillion, versus
the estimate released in February. The gap was seen narrowing
to $1.42 trillion in 2011.
 Republicans jumped on the numbers as proof ""Obamanomics""
was not working.
 ""This report confirms that our national debt will double in
five years and triple in 10 years. It confirms that our
deficits are not sustainable,"" U.S. House of Representatives
Republican Leader John Boehner said in a statement.
 The review also tweaked White House assumptions about the
economy, which have been criticized as overly optimistic in the
past. The White House forecast growth at 3.2 percent this year,
3.6 percent in 2011 and 4.2 percent in 2012.
 Unemployment will only decline slowly, to 8.1 percent in
2012, the year of next presidential election, and stay above 6
percent until 2015.
 The forecasts were based on data available through May and
finalized in early June.
 ""The most pressing danger we now face is unacceptably weak
growth and persistent unemployment, rather than outright
economic collapse, and that is a very substantial difference,""
White House Budget Director Peter Orszag told reporters.
 Job creation is a vital goal for Obama and will loom large
in the November poll, but unemployment has lagged growth and
remains at a lofty 9.5 percent.
 EUROPEAN RISKS
 ""The U.S. economy still faces strong headwinds,"" the White
House said, citing a weak housing market and doubts about the
recovery in Europe, which could sap demand for exports.
 ""The European recovery is at risk because of increased
uncertainty while government stimulus is withdrawn, and a
further slowdown in Europe would pose problems for the rest of
the world whose exports to Europe may be reduced,"" it said.
 Britain and Germany have announced austerity plans to
reassure investors, contrasting with the U.S. preference of
phasing in budget controls going forward.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, in an
article in the Financial Times on Friday, urged countries using
the common euro currency to ""implement a credible medium-term
fiscal consolidation strategy.""
 In contrast, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke argued
this week the economy still needed fiscal support and it did
not make sense to try to rein in this year's deficit.
 But he stressed the country needs to curb the deficit over
the next 2 to 3 years.
 Obama signed an $862 billion emergency stimulus last year,
which the White House says helped restore U.S. growth. But his
subsequent efforts to increase aid to cash-strapped states and
small businesses have been thwarted in Congress, mainly by
Republicans in the Senate objecting to more deficit spending.
 U.S. government debt held by the public is projected to
rise above 70 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 and
reach 77 percent by 2020.
 Critics warn adding to the deficit could sap investor faith
in the administration's commitment to phase in budget controls,
risking a sovereign debt crisis here that unnerved European
markets earlier this year.
 Long-term U.S. interest rates have stayed low despite the
grim U.S. budget outlook, supporting the recovery by holding
down borrowing costs on mortgages and auto loans. But that
could quickly change if bond investors take fright.
 Obama vows to halve the deficit by 2013, a promise the
larger Group of 20 rich and emerging nations also adopted at a
meeting in Toronto last month, and the president has appointed
a bipartisan commission to suggest how to tackle the fiscal
challenge.
 Obama's 18-strong panel is expected to recommend a mixture
of spending cuts and tax increases when it reports findings by
the end of December, well after the congressional vote.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the
dollar on Friday after most euro zone banks passed stress
tests, though analysts worried the checks weren't strict enough
to reveal the true health of the sector.
 The four top French banks and all but one German bank were
judged to have sufficient capital cushions to survive potential
losses on their sovereign debt holdings.
 Seven of 91 banks failed the tests, including ones in
Greece and Spain, for an overall capital shortfall of $3.5
billion euros. For details, see
 The euro initially fell as results trickled in and
investors worried the tests weren't rigorous enough. Most took
issue with a decision to apply losses only to debt held on
banks' trading books, not on those bonds held to maturity.
 But it recovered late in New York, rising 0.3 percent to
$1.2918, thanks to strong euro zone economic data and a U.S.
stock market rally that stoked appetite for risk.
 ""There's definitely suspicion out there about these tests,
but the euro is coming off a very good week thanks to solid
economic data, and that's lending support,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Fear of a euro zone debt crisis and its impact on European
banks drove the euro below $1.19 last month, its lowest level
since 2006. But it began a swift recovery in July and hit a
10-week high above $1.30 earlier this week.
 That was partly driven by data showing the euro zone
economy has been holding up better than anticipated, even as
governments tighten their belts to reign in large deficits.
 Data Friday showed German business sentiment staged a
record jump in July to its highest level in three years.
 Recent U.S. housing and manufacturing data, meanwhile, has
suggested a recovery may be fizzling, dashing investor hopes
for higher U.S. interest rates this year and dulling the appeal
of dollar-denominated assets.
 The euro also rose 0.8 percent to 112.93 yen while the
dollar added 0.6 percent to 87.40 yen.
 Sterling rose 1.1 percent to $1.5417 boosted by data
showing Britain's economy grew almost twice as fast as expected
in the second quarter..
 STRESS TEST SKEPTICISM LINGERS
 Analysts said the euro looked vulnerable in the long run.
 ""The simple fact that the stress tests only evaluated the
sovereign debt that the banks traded, rather than the sovereign
debt that the banks held on their balance sheets really, in my
opinion and in a lot of people's opinions, makes the tests not
a valid measure of solvency,"" said Greg Salvaggio, vice
president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York, said the stress tests ""weren't
particularly stressful"". 
 For instance, he said that since most analysts fear Greece
will eventually have to restructure its debt, it makes no sense
to assume lenders will be paid off at par if Greek bonds are
held to maturity.
 Salvaggio predicted a euro retreat to $1.2750 over the
coming days, and Dolan said the real test would come on Monday,
when investors get a look at European interbank lending rates.
If these rise, he said the euro may struggle.
 ""You could start to see a two-tiered banking system in
which some have sufficient capital and can borrow, while
another group has to pay a big premium to borrow and may not be
able to borrow at all,"" he said.

 WASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - The Obama administration
warned on Friday the U.S. economy had encountered ""strong
headwinds"" and the country's fiscal challenge remained grave,
but it lowered an estimate for the budget deficit this year.
 In broad terms, no major changes were made in the updated
outlook for the country's fiscal path over the next decade for
the country's deficits and debts, which the White House readily
admit remain too high.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday
as fewer-than-expected European banks failed stress tests, but
the euro fell as analysts questioned the tests' credibility.
 Gold tracked the euro lower, falling below $1,190 an
ounce.
 Seven out of 91 European banks failed tests imposed by
regulators, showing an overall capital shortfall of 3.5
billion euros under the worst scenario.
 ""The market expectation was that you were going to have
about 10 bank failures -- two from Germany, one from Greece
and about six from Spain -- and capital shortfalls totaling at
least 100 billion euros,"" said Cary Leahey, an economist at
Decision Economics in New York.
 A larger number of failures, Leahey added, would have
added credibility to the tests.
 The tests, released after European markets closed, were
designed to provide a clear picture of the impact of Europe's
sovereign debt crisis on its financial institutions.
 But regulators said on Friday the stress tests were
applied only to the banks' trading books -- not their banking
books.
 On Wall Street, U.S. stocks scored solid gains in early
Friday afternoon trading, following Dow component General
Electric's announcement of a dividend increase and the
European banks' stress tests. Initially, the three U.S. stock
indexes were mixed -- Dow up a touch while the S&P 500 and the
Nasdaq were down slightly -- right after the stress test
results were released. The stress test results came on the
heels of solid earnings from major U.S. companies, including
Microsoft and Ford.
 In Europe, the market closed higher before the results of
the tests were released. Mining shares ranked among the
gainers as copper hit a two-month high. The STOXX Europe 600
Banking Index inched higher.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
advanced 0.29 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top European shares advanced 0.48 percent to end at
1,044.31.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes had fluctuated between
positive and negative territory most of the morning.
 At 1733 GMT, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> shot
up 84.61 points, or 0.82 percent, to 10,406.91 -- just about
22 points below its 2009 close.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 7.11 points,
or 0.65 percent, to 1,100.78 -- within about 15 points of
being at the break-even point for the year. The Nasdaq
Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 16.17 points, or 0.72 percent, to
2,262.96 -- just about 7 points below where it ended 2009.
 On Friday, General Electric Co  moved to raise its
dividend by 20 percent in a sign that the largest U.S.
conglomerate has put the worst of the financial crisis behind
it. Shares of GE, a Dow component, jumped 3 percent to
$15.66.
 The euro was down 0.52 percent against the dollar, at
$1.2821, after rising briefly after data showed German
business sentiment jumped in July to its highest level in
three years.
 The anxiety over the stress tests boosted the dollar's
safe-haven appeal, driving it up 0.40 percent against the
Japanese yen to 87.26.
 The dollar also gained against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index up 0.19
percent at 82.755.
 U.S. crude oil futures fell 64 cents, or 0.80 percent, to
$78.66 per barrel following the stress test results. Earlier,
U.S. oil futures reached an 11-week high at $79.60.
 The 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined 3/32 in price,
with the yield at 2.953 percent. Traders said the uncertainty
over the stress tests was curbing a broader sell-off in the
Treasury market.
 U.S. August gold futures  fell $6.50 to $1,189.20 an
ounce following the stress test results.

 By Walter Brandimarte and Dominic Lau
 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Anxiety about the
looming results of European bank stress tests pushed the euro
down against the dollar and weighed on global stocks on
Friday.
 Oil prices fell and Treasuries trimmed some losses as
investors favored safe-haven assets, on fears that the stress
tests results, even if positive, may not show the true health
of financial institutions.
 The tests -- whose results were due to released at 12 p.m.

the impact of the Europe's sovereign debt crisis on its
financial institutions. But on Friday regulators said they were

 Both U.S. and European stocks managed to edge higher ahead

 In Europe, mining shares were among gainers as copper hit a

 Also bringing some optimism to the market was data showing
German business sentiment jumped in July to its highest level
in three years. The report from the Munich-based Ifo think-tank
helped ease concerns that the global economy could slip back
into recession.

 NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Friday as doubts grew that the stress tests of
European banks won't reveal the true health of financial
institutions.
 The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) said
losses on sovereign debt holdings were applied only to banks'
trading books, not their banking books.
 The euro briefly traded below $1.28 as the news fed
skepticism the stress tests will not shed light on banks'
capacity to withstand serious financial market turbulence.
""It appears that the worst may be true with regards to how
bonds would be subjected to testing,"" said Win Thin, senior
currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 In late morning trading, the euro was down 0.5 percent at
$1.2825, after hitting a session low at $1.2794 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 Official results of the tests on 91 top European banks are
due around 12:00 pm (1600 GMT). They are being coordinated by
the CEBS, a London-based body consisting of representatives of
central banks and supervisors from the 27 EU nations.
 Thin said the positions in the trading book is usually held
for a limited amount of time and profits are determined by mark
to market, while the banking book contains assets held for
longer and profits are usually calculated on an accrual basis
if held to maturity.
 ""We do not know of any analyst that thinks Greece can avoid
a debt restructuring. Does it make sense to assume that they
will be paid off at par if held to maturity? By leaving out
stress tests on the banking book, then a true picture of bank
balance sheets will clearly not be obtained,"" he said.
 Earlier, the euro had gained after data showing an
unexpected jump in German business sentiment in July to reach
its highest level in three years.
 The euro also erased gains versus the yen and was last at
111.97, down 0.1 percent on the day.
 A report in Spanish newspaper El Pais that several of the
country's 18 savings banks had failed the stress tests added to
pressure on the single euro zone currency.
 ""A great deal of caution should be exercised by traders
today as the results of the stress tests are made public,"" said
Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets, in Chicago.
 ""There is definitely the potential for a huge swing in
either direction, followed by an equally enormous reversal as
all of the information is digested.""
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent versus the yen at 87.31 yen,
staying above 86.27 yen struck on trading platform EBS late
last week, its weakest since December 2009.
 The greenback was up 0.3 percent versus a currency basket
at 82.879.
 Sterling rose over 1 percent on the day to $1.5404, boosted
by data showing Britain's economy grew almost twice as fast as
expected in the second quarter of this year.

 ZURICH, July 23 (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank could
use its hoard of euro reserves to buy Canadian and Australian
dollars and reduce exposure to the euro after taking a large
exchange rate hit last quarter, traders and analysts said on
Friday.
 The Swiss National Bank, which built up foreign exchange
reserves worth over 226 billion Swiss francs ($216 billion),
mainly in euros as it sought to keep a lid on the value of the
franc, is now looking to diversify its holdings, said analysts.
 ""It makes absolute sense for the SNB to broaden its exposure
given that reserves have increased so much. Reserves have to be
managed when they reach these levels,"" said Deutsche economist
Henrik Gullberg.
 A SNB spokesman declined to comment.
 The bank came in for criticism earlier this week after
saying it could report a first half loss of around 4 billion

interventions in recent quarters. [ID:nLDE66K04G]

recent rally in the euro to achieve diversification,"" said one
foreign exchange strategist who asked not to be named.
 The euro fetched a maximum of over 1.68 francs towards the
end of 2007, but has nosedived since and is currently trading at
around 1.35 francs per euro.
 The SNB's foreign exhhange intervention policy was aimed at
preventing too sharp a rise in the franc while fears of
deflation persisted through the financial crisis.
 The central bank's monthly report on July 21 showed the euro
now accounts for 70.5 percent of reserves, which some analysts
said was unduly risky.
 Analysts said the SNB was likely to reduce this exposure by
using euros to buy other currencies. This was not part of the
SNB's monetary policy, and would have little or no effect on the
franc, said Credit Suisse economist Marcus Hettinger.
 Some analysts said it made sense for the SNB to diversify
into Canadian and Australian dollars, currently seen as two of
the stronger second-tier currencies.
 ""There's a sovereign debt crisis in Eurozone, and the UK and
U.S. debt situations also raise concerns, while Canada and
Australia have rather solid public finances,"" said Hettinger.
 ""There's also a commodities story in there,"" Hettinger said.
The economies of both countries have been sustained by robust
demand for raw materials, base metals and energy.
 Other analysts said the Canadian and Australian currencies
were supported by rising interest rate differentials. Australia
began raising interest rates last year, while Canada rates went
up this week, albeit from a very low level, they said.
 Data from the International Monetary Fund show other central
banks are also buying into currencies that are less commonly
held as reserves.
 ""There are a lot of issues with the dollar and the euro at
the moment, and that's the main reason central banks are looking
at alternatives,"" Gullberg said.
 ""But there's a limit to how much central banks can
diversify. Few markets -- the dollar, sterling, the yen, the
euro -- are deep enough for large scale investors to achieve
meaningful diversification,"" he said.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2010 09:44AM ET</span>",Completion of EU-S.Korea trade deal faces delays," * EU divisions could delay South Korea trade deal - envoys
 * EU lawmakers fear South Korean car influx
 * Final phase of talks to start Aug 27
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck 
 BRUSSELS, July 23 (Reuters) - Completion of a trade accord
between the European Union and South Korea could be delayed
because of differences between the European Parliament and
national governments, EU diplomats and lawmakers say.
 The executive European Commission, which negotiates trade
deals on behalf of the 27-country bloc, initialled the free
trade pact with South Korea last October but it requires the
approval of the assembly to go into force.
 In preparation for talks with parliament and Commission, EU
ambassadors on Thursday instructed the negotiator for the
European Council - which represents the governments - on their
common position on questions about the EU's car sector and
single market arising from the accord.
 But they face what are likely to be difficult talks with the
parliament at meetings scheduled for late August because of
legislators' concerns that the agreement could flood the EU
market with cars made in South Korea, EU diplomats say.
 ""We have unanimous agreement in Parliament. It is up to the
European Council and Commission to clarify their positions to
reach a compromise,"" parliament's lead negotiator, Pablo Zalba
Bidegain, told Reuters.
 Supporters of the free trade pact say it could be worth 100
billion euros ($128.8 billion) annually to both economies, but
critics say it will be detrimental to the EU's auto sector.
 The deal, which the Commission hopes will enter into force
this year, is the most important to be negotiated between the EU
and a third country since a deadlock in the Doha round of world
trade talks spurred bilateral trade negotiations.
 It will generate about 19 billion euros' worth of new
exports for EU producers and 12 billion euros in goods for South
Korean firms, the Commission says.
 But it has to be ratified by the European Council, which
groups national governments, and the parliament, which can amend
or block trade policy under a treaty in force since December.
 
 CONCERN OVER EU CAR MAKERS
 Demands by parliament for changes to the trade pact have
reignited debate over EU car makers.
 Some lawmakers want to empower individual EU states or
groups of countries to raise emergency tariffs against car
imports in the event of a surge in imports, even if there is no
agreement across the whole EU to do so.
 National governments say such national or regional emergency
safeguard duties could violate the EU's single market rules,
which are intended to protect the free movement of goods,
capital, labour and services.
 ""A regional safeguard on car imports is going to create the
biggest struggle"" between the parliament, the governments and
the Commission, Bidegain said. 
 There are not yet any concrete proposals on cross-border car
sales between EU countries with different tariffs, he said.
 ""Whether a Korean car that has been imported into Greece
with no extra duties can then be sold to a European country
where emergency tariffs are in place, that is a matter we have
not yet discussed,"" he said.
 Diplomats said EU national governments had also instructed
their lead negotiator to reject any proposals that might be seen
as a precedent for reducing the decision-making clout of small
states and increasing the power of the assembly in trade policy.
 A representative of EU governments will meet negotiators
from the Commission and Bidegain on Aug. 27. 
 If the Commission, governments and assembly reach a
compromise by September, the agreement with South Korea could be
signed and completed soon afterwards, diplomats say. If not,
talks between the three institutions could continue for months.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2010 08:20AM ET</span>","GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Sweet Europe, sour America?"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Investors are finding themselves
with a new kind of balancing act -- one in which they have to
juggle with three major regions posing three significantly
different circumstances.
 Europe's bank stress testing, the focus of much of the past
week's market focus, is but one ball in the air.
 First there is the United States, which is believed to be
facing another slowdown, if not a double-dip recession.
 Then there is Europe, suffering a debt crisis and
austerity-bound, yet suddenly surprising everyone with an
unexpected burst of economic vigour.
 Thirdly, comes Asia, growing away so merrily that investors
are beginning to be concerned that too much zeal will be
exercised in trying to slow things down.
 On top of that there is the decoupling of economics and
earnings -- keeping bond yields down and lifting stocks. The
latest investment flow data from EPFR Global showed ""yield
hungry but skittish"" investors flooding into bonds, but world
stocks up more than 7 percent for the month.
 ""We are really in a much more difficult stage of the
recovery right now,"" Michala Marcussen, head of global economics
at Societe Generale, said at a briefing with Reuters
journalists.
 She described markets as struggling with a ""rotating
crisis"" in which one problem in one region becomes the focus of
concern, only to be quickly replaced by another in another
region.
 ""That ping pong is likely to go on for some time,"" she said.
 
 EUROPEAN TIGER?
 Entering the new week, investors will first have to deal
with any fallout from the stress tests of 91 European banks, due
out of Friday after much fanfare.
 Markets have been fairly calm about the tests, which, with
Greece and other peripheral euro zone economies in mind, were
designed to see how banks would fare in serious future crises.
 The consensus has been that some smaller banks may fail but
that the amounts needed to recapitalise them against future
crises would be manageable or indeed in many cases have already
been put on one side by governments.
 Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers in
Paris, sees no broad impact for equities from the results, even
if a number of small banks need to have capital hikes.
 ""Recapitalisation will affect the usual suspects: small
regional banks. But all this will be done in a smooth and
harmonised way with local authorities, and it shouldn't be a
market-disruption event,"" he said.
 Of much more impact, however, may be highly surprising signs
of economic revival in Europe.
 European purchasing managers' indexes in the past week
showed private sector business activity accelerating in July,
surprising economists who had expected a slowdown.
 They indicated third-quarter euro zone growth of around
0.6-0.7 percent, double the 0.3 percent forecast in the most
recent Reuters poll.
 This was followed up by German business sentiment posting a
record jump in July to its highest level in three years.
 Non-euro zone member Britain also surprised with its economy
growing twice as fast as expected in the second quarter of this
year propelled by a sharp pick-up in services and the biggest
rise in construction in almost 50 years.
 Investors being investors, of course, these robust numbers
triggered some new concerns about monetary tightening -- hence
the spike in the euro and pound against the dollar.

 WEAKLING AMERICA?
 The biggest piece of data likely to focus investors'
attention in the coming week is U.S. second-quarter GDP, out on
Friday.
 The U.S. economy is clearly coming off the boil, if, indeed,
it was boiling. After three quarters of solid growth it is
showing signs of slowing with firms still reluctant to hire and
the housing sector seemingly unable to exit a prolonged rut.
 It was enough, during the past week to prompt promises from
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke for more action if there
are further signs of faltering.
 This would particularly be the case if jobs don't pick up.
 ""We are ready and will act if the economy does not continue
to improve, if we don't see the kind of improvements in the
labour market that we are hoping for and expecting,"" he told the
House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.
 This admission that all is not well has broad implications
for investors even if other global drivers -- major emerging
market economies, such as China, and now Europe -- are still on
the upswing.
 The question could turn out to be whether markets and other
economies can thrive without the U.S. engine. History suggests
not.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Another strong data release
boosted the euro on Friday when the German Ifo index came in
above forecasts, but analysts said there were downside risks for
the currency, even if bank stress test results were benign.
 Ifo said the German Business Climate Index for July was
106.2, beating a consensus for 101.6 and pushing the euro to a
session high versus the dollar of $1.2967.
 The data followed strong euro zone purchasing manager
surveys which helped push the euro up more than 1 percent on
Thursday.
 ""We've seen a big jump in the euro as the Ifo data bodes
positive for Germany's growth outlook ... but the move may be
undone if we get a negative surprise from the stress test,"" said
Sverre Holbek, currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen.
 Official results of the test are due around 1600 GMT.
 At 1114 GMT, the euro was up around 0.4 percent at $1.2930,
recovering from the day's low of $1.2861 after Spanish newspaper
El Pais reported that several of the country's 18 savings banks
had failed the stress tests.
 ""The market's assumption is that several of the Spanish
cajas will fail, along with some peripheral European banks. But
if it goes beyond that the euro reaction will be negative,"" said
Adam Cole, head of global FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 Orders seen around $1.2820 had limited the euro's fall in
early trade, but Citigroup analysts said they saw a downside
risk for EUR/USD after the results are published.
 ""This reflects an almost no-win situation: either the test
results condemn a sufficiently large number of banks or they
will be deemed inadequate by the market,"" they said in a note.
 Euro/dollar 1-month risk reversals, a measure of currency
sentiment, showed a bias for euro downside. Traders said that
partly reflected speculation the euro may start falling some
time after the test results.
 The euro was up 0.6 percent versus the yen at 112.75 yen,
having risen about 0.9 percent on Thursday. It fell to the day's
low of 111.73 yen after the newspaper report.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent versus the yen at 87.19 yen,
staying above 86.27 yen struck on trading platform EBS late last
week, its weakest since December 2009.
 The greenback was down 0.3 percent versus a currency basket
at 82.389.
 Sterling rose over 1 percent on the day to $1.5450, boosted
by data showing Britain's economy grew almost twice as fast as
expected in the second quarter of this year.

trade
 * Legal expert says natural resources subject to WTO rules
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, July 23 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization
called on Friday for countries to work together more closely in
trade in natural resources -- an area often seen as exempt from
many international commerce rules.
 Governments must cooperate more intensively to deal with the
challenges for both importing and exporting countries in trade
in natural resources, such as export restrictions and import
tariffs, it said in its annual World Trade Report.
 ""In a world where scarce natural resource endowments must be
nurtured and managed with care, uncooperative trade policies
could have a particularly damaging effect on global welfare,""
the report said.
 The report defines natural resources as fuels, forestry,
mining and fisheries -- goods that are found naturally and can
be used with minimal processing. It excludes agriculture, where
products are cultivated not extracted, and industrial goods
employing minerals that require a high level of processing.
 Trade in such goods in 2008 was $3.7 trillion in 2008, or
nearly 24 percent of total world trade in merchandise goods, a
share that has been rising by 20 percent a year for the last
decade, reflecting rising commodity prices.
 ""I believe not only that there is room for mutually
beneficial negotiating trade-offs that encompass natural
resources trade, but also that a failure to address these issues
could be a recipe for a growing tension in international trade
relations,"" WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said in a foreword
to the report.
 
 EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCES
 WTO rules allow countries to restrict exports of natural
resources to preserve an exhaustible resource.
 Zhao Hong, a diplomat at China's mission to the WTO, said at
the launch of the report in Geneva that WTO members had
inalienable rights to the resources on their territory, while
WTO rules allowed them to pursue goals such as environmental
protection or sustainable development.
 The United States, European Union and Mexico have complained
to the WTO about China's restrictions on raw materials, and the
WTO itself has questioned whether these are effective.
 Such restrictions, as well as measures by importing
countries, are open to legal challenge, said Joost Pauwelyn,
professor of international law at Geneva's Graduate Institute
for International Studies.
 It was an ""urban myth"" that natural resources are not
covered by the WTO, he said at the launch.
 For instance a country could not claim to use export
restrictions to preserve resources if it did not restrict
domestic consumption.
 Similarly production restrictions by a country that exports
almost its entire output of a natural resource could be
challenged as an export restraint, while consumption taxes on a
country that relies on imports for a product could be seen as
tariff open to challenge.
 Still, trade in natural resources is not the same as other
products, as it raises environmental issues and competition is
limited as production cannot be switched to other locations.
 ""Natural resources and energy are unevenly distributed
between countries as well as fixed. BP will confirm this: you
cannot move an oil well,"" Pauwelyn said.
 Pauwelyn said he could envisage negotiations where exporters
agreed to curb their export restraints in exchange for importers
limiting carbon tariffs.
 The report shows that non-WTO member Russia was the biggest
exporter of natural resources in 2008, with a value of $341
billion, while the United States is the biggest importer, taking
in $583 billion.

(Adds detail, comment)
 By Fiona Shaikh and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery
raced ahead from April to June as the biggest jump in
construction in half a century and a surge in services propelled
growth at its fastest pace in four years.
 Gross domestic product jumped 1.1 percent in the second
quarter, data from the Office for National Statistics showed.
That was almost twice the rate analysts expected and nearly four
times the pace of growth in the first quarter.
 Friday's figures suggested Britain's recovery was on a
firmer footing than many feared, easing concerns that deep
public spending cuts could drive the economy back into
recession, though some said growth may lose momentum in the
third quarter.
 The pound jumped more than half a cent against the dollar
and interest rate futures plunged as investors questioned how
long the Bank of England would keep interest rates at their
record low, particularly with inflation so far above target.
 BoE policymakers discussed injecting more stimulus into the
economy this month for the first time since February, reflecting
concerns over headwinds from the euro zone debt crisis, bank
lending constraints and fiscal tightening. [ID:nLDE66K0R8]
 But concern about price pressures has led Monetary Policy
Committee member Andrew Sentance to vote for a quarter-point
rise in rates for the last two months, and analysts said
Friday's data may persuade others on the MPC to join him.
 ""The strong growth registered in Q2 suggests that further
policy loosening may be unnecessary, and may help to swing the
debate in favour of those arguing that the economy is
sufficiently robust to withstand some modest policy tightening,""
said Simon Hayes, economist at Barclays Capital.

 AS GOOD AS IT GETS?
 Finance minister George Osborne said the figures were
evidence that the private sector would be able to fill the gap
left by public spending cutbacks.
 ""Today's figures show the private sector contributing all
but 0.1 percent of the growth in the second quarter, and put
beyond doubt that it was right to begin acting on the deficit
now,"" he said.
 But analysts cautioned that growth could lose momentum in
the second half of this year.
 Separate figures on Friday showed banks were still not
lending freely, suggesting households and businesses may find it
hard to make up for the expected drop in government spending.
 Even with the second quarter bounce, Britain has recouped
around only a quarter of the output lost during the deepest
recession since World War Two, which wiped 22 billion pounds off
the economy.
 ""My hunch is that Q3 is certainly not going to be as good as
this,"" said Amit Kara, economist at UBS, who said the
government's forecast for 1.3 percent growth this year still
looked optimistic. ""This is about as good as it gets.""
 A breakdown of the figures showed the services sector
enjoyed its fastest growth in three years, expanding by 0.9
percent on the quarter -- three times as fast as in Q1 and
contributing 0.7 percentage points to growth.
 Manufacturing grew 1.6 percent, its biggest rise in more
than 10 years.
 Construction leapt 6.6 percent on the quarter -- its fastest
rate since 1963, rebounding after weather-related weakness at
the start of the year.
 However, analysts urged caution in interpreting the figures,
which were based for the first time based on a new monthly
survey.
 ""There was a surprising pick up in new work in the private
sector -- we would question how plausible this is,"" said Hetal
Mehta, senior economic advisor to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club.

 BRUSSELS, July 23 (Reuters) - The European Union has
launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of a
flame-retardant chemical from China, the executive European
Commission said on Friday.
 The investigation follows a complaint lodged by Europe's
leading chemicals lobby in June and will look at imports of tris
(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) phosphate. 
 ""The complainant has provided evidence that imports of the
product under investigation from the country concerned have
increased overall in absolute terms and in terms of market
share,"" the Commission said in its official journal, adding
there was evidence that the product's pricing hurt EU industry.
 The announcement follows recent EU decisions to investigate
Chinese trade practices in the paper, ceramics, chemicals and
bicycle industries and is likely to aggravate EU-Chinese
relations.
 Officials from the 27-country EU have until October 2011 to
impose protective duties on the chemical, and these could remain
for up to five years. 
 Duties could benefit European producers of the compound. A
person familiar with the case said these included Germany's BASF

 The probe will test the production costs and export pricing
practices of selected Chinese producers. Dozens of firms produce

 LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday after a
survey showed German business sentiment posted a record jump in
July to its highest level in three years, and corporate results
lifted stocks ahead of eagerly awaited European bank stress test
results.
 The single currency was lower before the Ifo survey, as
Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that several of the country's
18 savings banks had failed the tests, which are due to be
published on Friday afternoon.
 The report from the Munich-based Ifo think tank helped ease
concerns that the global economy could slip back into recession.
 ""We expected an increase but we didn't expect this. The
German economy is running really strong at the moment,"" said
Ralph Solveen at Commerzbank.
 ""Companies are not letting themselves be distracted by all
the negative discussions going on, such as the bank stress
tests, the debt crisis or the threat of a double-dip recession
in the United States.""

 The dollar, meanwhile, slipped 0.3 percent against a basket
of major currencies.
 The results of the tests on 91 European banks, which use
scenarios including declines in the value of the sovereign debt
they hold, are due at 1600 GMT.
 The European Union cleared Spain and Portugal to extend
state support for their banks until the end of 2010, the latest
move to help institutions weather the crisis.
 ""The market's assumption is that several of the Spanish
Cajas (savings banks) will fail, along with some peripheral
European banks. But if it goes beyond that the euro reaction

 Meanwhile, Manfred Weber, the head of the Association of
German Banks, told local radio that he was confident that German
banks ""all in all"" would perform well in the tests.
 Some analysts also consider Germany's quasi-public regional
landesbanks to be at risk.
 According to a survey of investors conducted by Goldman
Sachs, 10 out of the 91 banks subjected to the tests were
expected to fail.
 The Goldman poll of 376 respondents, including hedge funds
and long-only investors, showed European banks were on average
expected to raise 37.6 billion euros ($48.4 billion) in extra
capital following the tests, it said in a note dated July 22.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2010 04:36AM ET</span>",UK economy grew twice as fast as expected in Q2," LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew almost
twice as fast as expected in the second quarter of this year,
buoyed by a sharp pick-up in services output and the fastest
rise in construction output in almost 50 years, official data
showed on Friday.
 The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic
product jumped 1.1 percent on the quarter, the fastest rise in
four years, and rose by 1.6 percent on the year -- the highest
in two years.
 The figures, which were well above even the highest
forecasts in a Reuters poll, may raise doubts over how long the
Bank of England will keep interest rates at their record low,
particularly with inflation running so far above target.
 Britain's services sector enjoyed its fastest growth in
three years, expanding by 0.9 percent on the quarter -- three
times as fast as in Q1 and contributing 0.7 percentage points to
growth.
 Manufacturing grew 1.6 percent, its biggest rise in more
than 10 years.
 Construction, meanwhile, leapt by 6.6 percent on the quarter
-- its fastest rate since 1963. The construction data was based
for the first time on a new monthly survey, rather than
estimates which used to be used at this stage.
 The ONS said the rebound in construction output in Q2 came
after a fall of 1.6 percent in Q1 which was due to the poor
weather. Construction output contributed 0.4 percentage points
to growth between April and June.

 * Benign result could also weigh on currency

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - Another strong data release
boosted the euro on Friday as the German Ifo index came in above
forecasts, but analysts said there were downside risks for the
currency, even if bank stress test results were benign.
 Ifo said the German Business Climate Index for July was
106.2, beating a consensus for 101.6 and pushing the euro to a
session high versus the dollar of $1.2948.
 Strong euro zone purchasing manager surveys on Thursday
helped push the euro up more than 1 percent the previous day.
 The euro had hit the day's low of $1.2861 on Friday on
trading platform EBS after Spanish newspaper El Pais reported
that several of the country's 18 savings banks had failed the
stress tests.
 But losses on the report were contained as many investors
awaited the official results at about 1600 GMT.
 ""The market's assumption is that several of the Spanish
cajas will fail, along with some peripheral European banks. But
if it goes beyond that the euro reaction will be negative,"" said
Adam Cole, head of global FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 Traders said movements ahead of the test results were likely
to be well contained, with orderboards showing good interest to
buy any dip towards $1.2820. Sovereign offers were reported
around $1.2950/60.
 At 0829 GMT, the euro was up around 0.4 percent at $1.2939.
Market players said there were downside risks for the single
currency, even if the test results were perceived to be benign.
 ""We see an asymmetric downside risk for EUR/USD as the
results are published,"" analysts at Citigroup said in a note to
clients.
 ""This reflects an almost no-win situation: either the test
results condemn a sufficiently large number of banks or they
will be deemed inadequate by the market.""
 Euro/dollar 1-month risk reversals, a measure of currency
sentiment, showed a bias for euro puts. Traders said that partly
reflected speculation the euro may start falling some time after
the test results.
 Data from broker ICAP showed euro/dollar 1-month risk
reversals at 1.35/1.85 percent, equalling its highest in more
than three weeks.
 The euro was up 0.4 percent versus the yen at 112.55 yen,
having risen about 0.9 percent on Thursday. It fell to the day's
low of 111.73 after the Spanish newspaper report.
 The dollar was flat versus the yen at 86.90 yen, staying
above a seven-month trough of 86.27 yen struck on trading
platform EBS late last week.
 The greenback was down 0.3 percent versus a currency basket
at 82.378.

(adds details, analysts, background)
 By Daniel Flynn
 PARIS, July 23 (Reuters) - French consumer spending on
manufactured goods unexpectedly plunged in June due a drop in
sales of clothes and household goods, reviving concerns over the
strength of the recovery in the euro zone's No. 2 economy.
 French statistics office INSEE said on Friday that consumer
spending on manufactured goods fell 1.4 percent in June, after a
0.6 percent rise in May, when it was boosted by World
Cup-related spending.
 That was well below the average forecast of a Reuters survey
of 23 analysts for a rise of 0.2 percent in June.
 On a quarter-on-quarter basis, consumption fell 0.9 percent
in the second quarter, roughly halving its 1.9 percent decline
in the first quarter.
 Consumer spending is the motor of France's roughly 1.6
trillion euro economy, but the INSEE indicator measures just
spending on manufactured goods, which accounts for roughly
one-quarter of total consumer spending.
 BNP Paribas analyst Dominique Barbet said the figures had
""strongly disappointed the market"" and could spell a drop in
overall French consumer spending in the second quarter for the
first time in two years.
 Sales of textiles and leather -- mainly clothing -- fell 5.0
percent in June, with INSEE noting this was partly due to a
delay in summer sales, which did not start until June 30 this
year. [ID:nPISMIE60I]
 Household goods sales fell 3.6 percent, handing back some of
May's steep 6.4 percent increase when they were boosted by sales
of electronic equipment before the World Cup.
 ABN Amro's Joost Beaumont said the figures partly
compensated for May' strong reading, but showed the fragility of
the French recovery.
 ""Sluggish labour market conditions, fading government
stimulus and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook
are likely to have made consumers hesitant to open their purse
strings. Looking forward, we expect these factors to stay
around,"" said Beaumont, who forecasts French gross domestic
product to grow 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 1.2
percent this year.
 INSEE has said growth in French gross domestic product
growth needs to accelerate to at least 0.4 percent in the third
and fourth quarters to meet the government's growth target of
1.4 percent in 2010. Growth was just 0.1 percent in the first
quarter.
 The French government's forecasts of an acceleration in GDP
growth to around 2.5 percent next year -- a level seen as
optimistic by many economists -- is a key part of its strategy
to pare its deficit to 3.0 percent of GDP by 2013, part of
European efforts to restore confidence in the euro zone.
 The French government's deficit is forecast to reach 8
percent of GDP this year.
 Data on Thursday showed French consumer confidence in July
remaining stable near historically low levels, due in part to
concerns over unemployment, while business confidence recovered
to its highest level since July 2008. [ID:nLDE66L0M2]
On Friday, an INSEE survey showed second-quarter industrial
demand improving, both from foreign and domestic clients,
although they remained well below historic levels
[ID:nPISMIE60J].
""For the third-quarter, the outlook for both overall and
foreign demand are set to fall,"" it said in a statement.

 * Test results expected around 1600 GMT
 * Euro/dollar risk reversals show bias for euro puts
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 23 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar and the yen on Friday after a newspaper said several
Spanish savings banks failed tests to see how they would cope
with worsened economic conditions.
 The euro hit the day's low of $1.2861 on trading platform EBS
after Spanish newspaper El Pais reported on Friday that several
of the country's 18 savings banks have failed the so-called
stress tests.
 But losses were limited in the single currency, which jumped
more than 1 percent against the greenback on Thursday, as many
investors awaited the official test results at about 1600 GMT.
 The euro has support at about $1.2720, an interim high from
July 9 set during its recent rally from a four-year low, and is
consolidating at $1.2720-1.3030. A break above that band could
see it testing $1.3090-1.3125, chartists say.
 But traders said the euro was unlikely to re-test this week's
10-week high of $1.3029 just yet nor fall sharply ahead of the
stress test results, which could move other currencies as well.
 Traders have been betting most of the 91 European banks being
examined will pass. Analysts say if there are no ugly surprises,
that will be euro supportive, although some are sceptical about
the severity of the checks.
 ""Unless test results show a surprisingly big number of banks
needing surprisingly large amounts of money to mend their health,
the results are expected to be euro supportive,"" said Jun Kato,
senior manager of the investment department at Shinkin Asset
Management, adding that there was no sense of panic following the
Spanish newspaper report.
 Euro bulls bet the euro could extend its rally partly on
dollar weakness due to concerns the U.S. recovery is faltering.
Below-forecast economic data has fanned fears about a slowing
economy, prompting investors to dump long dollar positions.
 For chartists, the $1.3090 target area is a spike higher on
May 10, while $1.3125 is the 32.8 percent retracement of the
euro's fall from its November high to the four-year low marked in
June.
 But bears bet the euro rally could lose steam, pressured by
selling against currencies with higher interest rate prospects,
such as the Australian and Canadian dollars.
 Chartists say a breach of $1.2720 support could be the first
warning of a deeper retracement from its 10-week high.
 Euro/dollar 1-month risk reversals, a measure of currency
sentiment, showed a bias for euro puts. Traders said that partly
reflected speculation the euro may start falling sometime after
the test results.
 Data from broker ICAP shows euro/dollar 1-month risk
reversals at 1.35/1.85 percent, around the highest in more than
three weeks.
 The yen has been under pressure after data on Thursday showed
surprisingly robust growth in European manufacturing and
services, and after strong earnings from U.S. blue chips such as
3M and Caterpillar rekindled hopes for the global economy and
improved investor appetite for risk.
 The euro was flat at 112.07 yen, having risen about 0.9
percent on Thursday. It fell to the day's low of 111.73 after the
Spanish newspaper report.
 The dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 87.09 yen, staying above a
seven-month trough of 86.27 yen struck on trading platform EBS
late last week. The greenback dipped 0.1 percent against the
Japanese currency on Thursday.

 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, July 23 (Reuters) - The yen's current levels seem too
high, a senior Cabinet Office official said on Friday, expressing
worries over the impact a strong yen could have on Japan's
fragile economy.
 ""The economy is moving toward a standstill, although views
are divided on whether it has stalled,"" Keisuke Tsumura, a
parliamentary secretary at the Cabinet Office, told reporters.
 ""I get the impression current (yen) levels are a bit too
high. We will closely watch how this will affect businesses and
the economic recovery, which lacks support from domestic demand.""
 Tsumura works under Economics Minister Satoshi Arai. The
Cabinet Office does not have control over currency policy, which
falls under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry.
 The dollar hit a seven-month low of 86.27 yen last week,
putting the focus on whether Japanese policymakers will increase
their warnings against yen gains.
 The fall took the dollar close to a 14-year low of 84.82 yen
set last November, but it has since recovered to around 87.00
yen.

 By Vikram S.Subhedar
 HONG KONG, July 23 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Friday
after a Spanish newspaper reported some of the country's 18
savings banks had failed stress tests to see how strong they
would be if economic conditions worsened, highlighting
nervousness ahead of the release of Europe-wide test results
later in the day.
 Though some of Spain's smaller banks or ""cajas"" had been
widely expected to fail the tests, European stock futures eased
and Asian stock markets gave up some of their strong early
gains after the report in the El Pais paper.
 It did not identify the savings banks. Analysts had
expected no problems at Spain's big banks.
 Separately, Manfred Weber, the head of the Association of
German Banks, told local radio that he was confident that
German banks ""all in all"" would perform well in the tests.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar to around
$1.2868 after the El Pais report, but remained close to its
late U.S. levels as traders awaited more comprehensive results
from the rest of Europe.
 Worries about the health of Europe's banks have weighed on
the single currency and global stock markets, and driven up the
region's funding costs, since Greece's debt crisis triggered
fears that the euro zone could unravel.
 The euro had jumped more than 1 percent against the dollar
on Thursday and European bank stocks rose across the board in a
sign that investors are starting to hope the worst is behind
the region's financial industry.
 But a lack of details about the terms of the tests and
earlier divisions among European Union members over how much
information will be made public has made investors wonder if
the assessments would be tough or transparent enough.
 Ironically, word of a few small failures in fiscally weaker
countries such as Portugal or Spain could actually boost
confidence in the vigorousness of the testing process. The
official results are expected around 1600 GMT, though some
sources said they could be released earlier.
 ""There is obviously the risk that if too many banks pass
and do so with a comfortable margin, the test may be judged as
too easy to have actually been informative about the strength
of the banking system,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Nick Kojucharov
wrote in a note.
 Analysts say the most concern is over how the banks'
holdings of European sovereign debt will be treated and whether
the assumed ""haircuts"" or expected losses on the debt are
stringent enough.
 ""It is very important that banks demonstrate that they have
nothing to hide,"" said Nomura analyst Peter Westaway in a note.
 A positive response to the test results would like spur
global investors to return to riskier assets, even though the
euro zone's deep-rooted debt problems will take years to
resolve.
 However, even if most banks pass the test, analysts
estimate lenders in the region will need to raise as much as 90
billion euros in fresh capital as they recover from the credit
crisis and comply with new regulations, which could blunt any
initial gains.
 STOCK MARKETS SUPPORTED BY STRONG EARNINGS
 Despite uncertainty ahead of the banks test results, Asian
stocks rose on Friday as strong earnings from U.S. economic
bellwethers such as Caterpillar tempered fears that the global
economic recovery may be stalling.
 Asian stocks outside Japan pared some gains after the
Spanish report but were still up 1.2 percent by 0625 GMT. They
looked set to gain more than 2 percent gain on the week, with
Asia ex-Japan equity funds seeing strong inflows.
 Japan's Nikkei also came off its early highs but ended up
2.3 percent, snapping a five-day losing streak.
 Major U.S. share indexes rose as much as 2.7 percent
overnight as robust quarterly results from construction and
mining equipment maker Caterpillar, 3M and other U.S.
multinationals suggested the global economy may be on stronger
footing than previously thought.
 A string of weak U.S. economic data in recent weeks and
worries that Europe's debt crisis could derail its already
fragile recovery have put heavy pressure on markets, but there
are signs that investors are slowly returning to riskier
assets.
 Emerging markets equity funds retained some of their
momentum from the previous week, with Asia ex-Japan Equity
Funds taking in over $800 million for the second week running,
according to data from fund-tracking firm EPFR Global.
 Crude oil futures slipped below $79 a barrel after jumping
to 11-week highs overnight as a potential storm threatened
production in the Gulf of Mexico.
 Shanghai copper also rose, chasing London which climbed to
near two-month peaks, spurred by a weaker dollar and an
unexpected surge in the euro zone's private sector growth.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2010 08:36PM ET</span>",FOREX-Euro steadies vs dollar before stress test results," TOKYO, July 23 (Reuters) - The euro steadied against the
dollar on Friday, retaining gains made the previous day on
strong euro zone data and U.S. corporate earnings, as investors
awaited European bank stress test results due later in the day.
 The euro, which jumped more than 1 percent on Thursday
against the greenback, moved in a narrow range around $1.2900,
little changed from late U.S. trade on Thursday.
 Traders said the euro was unlikely to try a 10-week high of
$1.3029 hit earlier this week, nor fall sharply from the current
level, ahead of the stress test results, which could move many
currencies, not just the euro.
 ""Few are seriously worried about results of the bank stress
tests now, and that is supporting the euro,"" said a senior FX
trader at a big Japanese bank.
 ""But it's hard to see whether the euro will extend gains
against the dollar after the test results as investors are well
aware the root problem of the euro zone debt woes is sovereign
credit trouble.""
 The yen slipped broadly after Thursday's data showing
surprisingly robust growth in European manufacturing and
services, and strong earnings from U.S. blue chips such as 3M
and Caterpillar rekindled hopes for the global economy, boosting
risk appetite.
 The euro rose 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade to 112.35
yen.
 The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 87.08 yen, staying above
a seven-month trough of 86.27 yen struck on trading platform EBS
late last week.

 * Ask for extensive changes in many parts of the pact
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - More than 100 U.S.
Democratic lawmakers asked on Thursday to meet with President
Barack Obama to discuss their concerns about his plan to seek
congressional approval of a trade deal with South Korea.
 ""At a time when our economy is struggling to recover from
the worst downturn since the Great Depression, it is
unthinkable to consider moving forward with another job-killing
FTA,"" the 110 members of the U.S. House of Representatives said
in a letter to Obama.
 The letter underscores the battle Obama faces within his
own party unless he persuades South Korea to make substantial
changes to the agreement it negotiated three years ago with the
administration of former President George W. Bush.
 Obama has said he wants to resolve outstanding concerns
with the pact by November so he can submit it to Congress by
early next year, a move welcomed by House Democratic Leader
Steny Hoyer.
 U.S. trade official have identified two main issues
blocking the pact: South Korea's restrictions on imports of
U.S. beefs, and auto trade provisions of the pact that critics
say favor South Korean automakers too much.
 But in their letter, the 110 House Democrats made clear
they had a longer list of concerns.
 ""We oppose specific provisions of the agreement in the
financial services, investment and labor chapters because they
benefit multi-national corporations at the expense of small
businesses and workers,"" they said.
 ""And we strongly object to the non-tariff barriers to the
Korean market that numerous U.S. industries -- including the
auto, beef and textile sectors -- will continue to face even as
their Korean counterparts receive virtually total access to the
American market,"" they said.
 The letter was signed by many top Democrats including
Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, Rules
Committee Chairman Louise Slaughter, Agriculture Committee
Chairman Collin Peterson and Education and Labor Committee
Chairman George Miller.
 They said they want to meet with Obama to discuss their
ideas for improving the Korean trade deal, and the U.S.
negotiating model for future free trade agreements.
 There are 255 Democrats and 178 Republicans in the House.
It takes a simple majority, or 217 votes currently, to pass a
trade deal. Most Republicans are expected to support the Korea
agreement if it comes to a vote.

 OTTAWA, July 22 (Reuters) -The Canadian dollar finished at
its highest level versus the U.S. currency in a week on
Thursday as oil prices jumped and equity markets rallied,
underpinned by a pack of global signals bullish enough to
alleviate economic growth fears.
 U.S. crude oil futures rose to an 11 week high above $79 a
barrel on a potential tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico and
as better-than-expected economic data gave a lift to equities
markets. [O/R]
 Major economically sensitive companies, including UPS and
3M, reported strong revenues, while U.S. housing data and
better-than-expected euro zone manufacturing and services
activity revived appetite for risk. A cautious tone from the
Bank of Canada did not dampen market enthusiasm.
[ID:nN22230580][ID:nSLALIE68S] [ID:nBRQ009921] [ID:nN22256221]
 Major North American stock indexes gained sharply,
overcoming some of the negative sentiment on the pace of
economic recovery that was sparked by U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke's downbeat testimony on the U.S. economy
on Wednesday.
 Risk-sensitive assets looked past a spike in the latest
week's U.S. jobless claims, as well as a report that showed
Canadian retail sales fell unexpectedly in May for the second
straight month. [ID:nN22228055]
 ""We got a few upside surprises on the data front,"" said
Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets.
 ""The market basically ignored continuing (U.S. job) claims
and preferred to focus on (U.S.) existing home sales. It just
made for a very strong risk appetite rally during the last 12
hours or so.""
 The Canadian currency  finished at C$1.0393 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.22 U.S. cents, up from Wednesday's close of
C$1.0477 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.45 U.S. cents.
 The Canadian dollar pared gains briefly after the Canadian
May retail sales report, but underlying details showed the
decline was largely from price distortion and that volume of
sales had climbed in the month. [ID:nN2215189]
 BONDS FALL AS RISK EMBRACED
 With risk appetite seeping back into the market, Canadian
bond prices were lower across the curve, tracking U.S.
Treasuries. [US/]
 The two-year bond  lost 8 Canadian cents to yield
1.557 percent, while the 10-year bond  shed 44
Canadian cents to yield 3.212 percent.
 In its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, the Bank of Canada
cut its growth forecasts for each quarter of 2010, warning for
a second time this week that global economic uncertainty and
cooling domestic consumption will dampen the recovery. The MPR
did little to change market expectations for future interest
rate hikes. [ID:nN22208118]
 ""In terms of market pricing, we haven't seen a whole lot of
significant change in rate expectations,"" said Shaun Osborne,
chief currency strategist at TD Securities.
 Markets are now pricing in about a 47 percent chance of a
25 basis-point increase in the Bank of Canada's benchmark rate
in September, according to Thursday's yields on overnight index
swaps that reflect expectations for the policy rate.

 Due on Friday, Canada's consumer price index is the next
key domestic economic report, with analysts expecting inflation
to ease to 1.0 pct in June. [ID:nN1684971]

(Updates prices)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro gained 1 percent
against the dollar on Thursday as strong euro zone economic
data and U.S. corporate earnings rekindled hopes for the world
economy and whetted investor appetite for risk.
 The euro rose above $1.29 after data showed surprisingly
robust growth in European manufacturing and services. But
uncertainty ahead of Friday's European bank stress test results
prevented a retest of a recent 10-week high above $1.30.
 For more on the data, see [ID:nSLALIE68S][ID:nBRQ009921]
 The yen pared gains against the dollar but dropped sharply
against other currencies as U.S. stocks rallied, improving
market sentiment a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke painted a gloomy outlook for the U.S. economy.
 Analysts said weak U.S. data lately has forced investors
to reconsider their assessment of U.S. economic might,
especially as euro zone data has held up better than expected
considering Europe's debt crisis and the raft of fiscal
austerity measures being implemented by governments with weak
public finances.
 ""We're seeing a struggle between perception and reality, as
data from Europe has been better than anticipated while what
we've seen from the U.S. has been quite soft,"" said Dean
Popplewell, chief strategist at FX brokerage OANDA in Toronto.
 ""The euro's had a hell of a bounce-back, and it's testing
the conviction of euro bears, who were touting its downfall
when it fell below $1.19 last month,"" he said.
 The euro rose 1 percent to $1.2887 , and added 0.8
percent to 112.05 yen . The dollar was off 0.2 percent
at 86.91 yen , above a session low of 86.35 yen.
 High-yielding, commodity-linked currencies such as the
Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar also
rose sharply against the greenback as risk appetite recovered.
 The dollar has struggled as weak U.S. economic data has
dashed market expectations of a Fed interest rate rise in 2011.
That has prompted investors to reassess expected returns on
dollar-denominated assets.
 The yield on two-year U.S. Treasuries fell to a record low
0.57 percent earlier this week, below the yield on comparable
German debt. [US/]
 Investors were cheered, however, by data on Thursday
showing U.S. existing home sales fell 5.1 percent in June, ,
less than the 8.1 percent decline expected in a Reuters poll.
[ID:nN22230580]
 STRESS TESTS LOOM
 James Chen, chief technical strategist at FX Solutions,
said the euro's tentative break above $1.29 resistance suggests
further gains ahead. ""If another attempt at a $1.30 breach
takes place, key upside resistance on such a bullish move
resides in the significant $1.31 price region,"" he said.
 Investors, Popplewell said, were reluctant to bid the euro
much higher ahead of the stress test results, which are due on
Friday. [ID:nWEA0704]
 The euro has had a good run against the dollar in
anticipation of the test results as traders bet most of the 91
European banks being examined would pass. [ID:nLDE66K0YO]
 Some say the test results could be positive for the euro if
they reveal no unpleasant surprises, but doubts linger about
whether the checks are tough or transparent enough.
 ""The market has certainly bought the rumor going into this
week that the stress tests will be positive and people have
been going long euro/dollar,"" said Lauren Rosborough, currency
strategist at Westpac.
 In the longer run, Popplewell said underlying problems in
the euro zone will stall the currency's upward momentum, as
will doubts about the severity of the stress tests.
 ""But if the market buys into these tests for now, we will
certainly see the euro trade higher,"" he said.

 * Illegal trade seizures down during economic gloom
 
 BRUSSELS, July 22 (Reuters) - Internet sales of counterfeit
and pirated goods to European consumers are frustrating attempts
to stem illegal trade, a European Commission report said on
Thursday.
 Three quarters of illegal shipments stopped by EU customs
officials in 2009 were shipped by post or air, suggesting that
Internet sales of illegal items have increased, according to an
annual report on illegal trade flows by the European executive
Commission's department for Taxation and Customs Union.
The figures highlight that counterfeiters are concentrating
increasingly on sales to individuals rather than dispatching
bulk shipments to intermediaries that are expensive to send and
could more easily be tracked.
 ""This development is very convenient for the counterfeiter
who no longer has to factor in delivery cost to his business
model,"" John Taylor, head enforcement officer on intellectual
property rights (IPR) in the EU's tax office, told journalists.
 Among the counterfeit and pirated goods are more general
household items rather than traditional luxury items such as
watches and bags. Customs officials noticed an increase in
illegal wigs, makeup, shoes and hair-straightening products
shipped by post, particularly to Ireland and the United Kingdom.
 Newcomers to the illegal trade include Egypt, from where EU
customs officials caught the majority of intercepted toys, and
the United Arab Emirates, the source of nearly 75 percent of
illegal medical products. Most food and alcohol that entered the
EU illegally came from Turkey.
 
 CHINA TOPS LIST
 China continued to top the list of countries that conduct
most illegal trade with Europe, accounting for nearly 65 percent
of items stopped. The EU signed an agreement with China last
year to fight illegal trade, but it is too soon to measure its
success, Taylor said.
 ""The Commission and the member states are convinced that the
most effective results can be obtained through cooperation with
the Chinese authorities,"" he said.
 EU Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta plans to discuss IPR
cooperation with his Chinese counterparts during a visit to
Shanghai in September.
 Reflecting the downturn in global trade, the volume of
illegal goods EU officials intercepted entering the bloc from
abroad in 2009 fell 12 percent compared to the previous year.
 Counterfeit and smuggled tobacco products made up 35 percent
of goods detained. The European Commission teamed up with
cigarette producer British American Tobacco on July 15 to fight
the trade in illegal cigarettes.
 The European Council endorsed a customs action plan in
March, but talks on a new anti-counterfeiting accord have
stalled over disagreement on the protection of European fashion
brands and food names. The European Commission plans to propose
legislation on IPR by the end of the year.

 * Urged to harness investments by multinationals
 * Low-carbon investment flows totalled $90 billion in 2009
 
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE AT 1700 GMT ON JULY 22)
 GENEVA, July 22 (Reuters) - Developing economies can
jumpstart low-carbon economic growth through ""clean"" investment
promotion policies, despite slow progress in international
climate negotiations, a United Nations agency said.
 The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) urged
developing country governments to harness investments by
multinational companies to ensure that economic growth does not
drive up carbon emissions.
 Multinationals can help cut emissions by improving
production processes in their operations and along their value
chains and by making and marketing cleaner goods and services,
UNCTAD said in its annual World Investment Report on Thursday.
 Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) into key low-carbon
business areas such as renewables, recycling and low-carbon
technology amounted to roughly $90 billion in 2009, it said.
 But taking into account low-carbon investments in other
industries, the actual total is much higher, it said.
 UNCTAD Secretary-General Supachai Panitchpakdi told a
briefing that green technology was likely to see an investment
boom similar to railways, cars and information technology in
previous centuries.
 UNCTAD officials believe developing countries should seize
the opportunity or risk being shut out of developed markets. For
instance, geographical location gives developing states huge
potential to develop solar power.
 The sectors with the most potential for this kind of
investment are power and industry, but transport, construction,
waste management, forestry and agriculture can also benefit, the
UNCTAD report said.
 At the same time there is a risk that companies will move
high-emission operations to locations with laxer regulation,
which can generate short-term economic growth for the country
concerned while impeding global efforts to cut emissions.
 UNCTAD said this problem of ""carbon leakage"" should be
tackled at its source through corporate governance measures such
as improved environmental reporting, rather than through border
measures such as tariffs on carbon content.
 The report forecasts overall FDI inflows will pick up to
$1.2 trillion this year and rise to $1.3-1.5 trillion in 2011.

 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, July 22 (Reuters) - Global foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows will steady this year and rise further in 2011-12 as
cross-border mergers by multinational companies pick up on
growing business confidence, a United Nations agency said.
 FDI, on which many developing countries rely to finance
their economies, will rise to $1.3-1.5 trillion in 2011 and
towards $1.6-2.0 trillion in 2012 from $1.2 trillion this year,
the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said.
 FDI inflows fell 37 percent to $1.11 trillion in 2009 after
falling 16 percent in 2008 and peaking at $2.1 trillion in 2007,
said its annual World Investment Report, released on Thursday.
 In the first quarter of this year FDI outflows were about 20
percent higher than a year earlier, it said.
 ""After this freefall, a timid and uneven recovery appears on
its way, thanks to better corporate profits and improved
economic and financial conditions.""
 Prospects for FDI growth are fraught with risks and
uncertainties, including the fragility of the recovery, it said.
 FDI refers to long-term investments, such as stakes in
foreign companies or the construction of a plant for a
subsidiary, in contrast to volatile financial investments.
 
 MULTINATIONAL CONFIDENCE
 The recovery in FDI will mainly occur through a revival of
cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) where restructuring
and the privatisation of companies rescued in the crisis will
offer opportunities, it said.
 Multinational companies' willingness to expand abroad looks
more robust for 2011 and 2012 than in 2010, with business
confidence benefiting from improved economic conditions,
corporate profits and stock market valuations seen this year.
 The report documents the growing weight of the emerging
economies as both sources and destinations for FDI.
 China and Russia were the sixth and seventh biggest sources
of FDI in 2009, with $48 billion and $46 billion in investments,
up from ninth and eighth positions respectively, in 2008.
 China and other Asian emerging states are growing sources of
FDI in African and other less developed countries, where FDI
remains a major source of overall investment in the economy.
 While the United States remains the biggest destination of
FDI, China edged up to second place in 2009 from third in 2008.
 The recent retreat in investment in manufacturing against
that of services -- driven by the need for labour-intensive
projects -- and the primary sector including mining and energy
-- benefiting from rising commodity prices -- is unlikely to be
reversed, UNCTAD said.
 In cross-border M&A, manufacturing fell 77 percent in value
in 2009, while the primary and services sectors contracted by 47
percent and 57 percent respectively, although the latter
included a drop of 87 percent in M&A in financial services.
 The number of cross-border M&A deals fell by 34 percent in
2009, or 65 percent in value, while greenfield investments in
new plant by multinational companies declined only 15 percent.
 M&A seems to be rebounding more quickly this year than
greenfield investment.
 The internationalisation of production continues to grow,
with the value added by foreign affiliates of multinational
firms shrinking less sharply in the past two years than the
overall economy. That took multinationals' share of the world
economy to a record 11 percent, employing 80 million people.
 Foreign direct investment by private equity funds fell by 65
percent in 2009, but flows from sovereign wealth funds increased
by 15 percent, UNCTAD said.
 Efforts to encourage investment inflows while regulating
them more thoroughly in the wake of the crisis are posing
challenges to governments. The proportion of more restrictive
investment policy measures rose to 30 percent in 2009, its
highest level since UNCTAD started monitoring the trend in 1992.

 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on
Thursday and the euro strengthened, backed by upbeat corporate
results, better-than-expected U.S. housing data, and an
improvement in European manufacturing and services activity.
 Expectations before the release of European banks' stress
test results appeared to show an easing of concerns as the
region's bank stocks ranked among the best performers.
 The increase in investors' risk appetite prompted some
selling of government bonds, while crude oil gained from a
combination of improving data and a weaker U.S. dollar. Gold
prices rose modestly, briefly edging back above $1,200.
 U.S. existing home sales fell less sharply than expected
in June. However the supply of unsold homes rose to the
highest amount in almost a year, the National Association of
Realtors said.

Caterpillar shares rose 1.48 percent to $67.86 .
 While Caterpillar raised its full-year outlook, citing
sales growth in emerging market mining and energy companies,

another economic slump and losses on government debt in the
wake of the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis.
 Shares of Barclays , HSBC , Societe

 ""There is hope that the stress test will take away a lot
of uncertainty surrounding European banks, but you have to
take into account that the ECB would not publish these results
if it would be a failure overall,"" said Koen de Leus, an
economist at KBC Securities.
 DOLLAR WILTS ON MORE EASING HINTS
 The dollar and U.S. Treasury bond yields came under
pressure on the prospect of further U.S. monetary easing.
 Bernanke's said in his testimony the Fed stood ready to
ease monetary policy further if the budding U.S. economic
recovery withers.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> fell 1 percent against a

 The euro rose 1.26 percent to $1.2902  after a
survey showed the euro zone's private sector surged in July.
 European purchasing managers' indexes showed private-

economists who had expected a slowdown, and indicating
third-quarter euro-zone growth of around 0.6 percent to 0.7
percent, analysts said.

 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmakers Eli Lilly and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co posted better-than-expected quarterly
earnings, withstanding tougher drug-price controls in Europe,
currency fluctuations and the costs of U.S. healthcare reform.
 ""The draconian view that health-care reforms in Europe
would badly hurt near-term earnings (of U.S. companies) was too
negative,"" said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler. ""In fact,
they seem to be managing not only U.S. reforms but European

 Lilly posted the bigger second-quarter earnings beat,
fueled by cost controls and higher U.S. prices for many of its
top medicines. Bristol-Myers also relied heavily on cost
management, and enjoyed considerably lower taxes.
 Swiss drugmaker Roche, meanwhile, reported
weaker-than-expected first-half earnings but maintained its
2010 outlook despite tough market conditions. It predicted
sales would rise in the mid-single-digit range.
 Indianapolis-based Lilly earned $1.35 billion, or $1.22 per

year-earlier period.
 Excluding items, it earned $1.24 per share, well above the
$1.10 per share forecast by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
 Revenue jumped 9 percent to $5.75 billion, above forecasts
of $5.58 billion. Sales would have risen 8 percent if not for
the weaker dollar, which raises the value of overseas sales.
 ""Lilly beat forecasts in the quarter primarily because
sales were about 3 percent better than expected, with Zyprexa
and Cymbalta the biggest reasons,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst
Barbara Ryan.
 Although results were impressive, Ryan said Lilly faces
long-term challenges of keeping earnings on track once
schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa begins facing generic
competition next year, followed by patent expirations in
following years on anti-depressant Cymbalta and some of its
other top-selling drugs.
 For now, at least, Ryan said Lilly's results were ""a
welcome relief,"" as were those of Abbott Laboratories, whose
performance trumped forecasts on Wednesday.
 FOCUS ON DRUG PROGRESS
 Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said results from
Lilly, Bristol-Myers, Abbott and Johnson & Johnson had calmed
investor fears about the main pressures on the pharmaceutical
industry.
 ""The worst expectations about international pricing,
foreign exchange, and healthcare reform are not being
realized,"" Fernandez said.
 He said the investors can breathe a little easier about
those macroeconomic factors, and focus more closely on the
fundamentals of individual companies -- including progress of
their experimental drugs through clinical trials.
 Bristol-Myers earned $1.27 billion, or 53 cents per share
from continuing operations, compared with $1.17 billion, or 44
cents per share, in the year-earlier period.
 Excluding special items, Bristol earned 54 cents per share,
a penny above the Thomson Reuters forecast.
 Company sales rose 2 percent to $4.77 billion, coming in a
bit below expected sales of $4.86 billion.
 Sales of Lilly's biggest drug, Zyprexa, rose 5 percent to
$1.26 billion, as higher prices offset lower U.S. demand.
Cymbalta revenue jumped 17 percent to $868 million, driven by
both higher prices and higher demand.
 Citing strong results to date, Lilly raised its 2010 profit
forecast to between $4.50 and $4.65 per share, excluding
special items, from its prior view of $4.40 to $4.55.
 Bristol-Myers, meanwhile, reaffirmed its full-year 2010
profit view of $2.10 to $2.20 per share, reflecting expected
growth of 13.5 percent to 19 percent over last year.
 Sales of its cancer drug Sprycel jumped 23 percent to $132
million in the second quarter, while revenue from Bristol's
Plavix blood clot preventer rose 6 percent to $1.6 billion.
 Bristol-Myers shares were up 1.7 percent at $25.16, while
Lilly rose 0.9 percent to $35.27, also on the New York Stock
Exchange, amid larger gains for the broad stock market. Roche
rose 1 percent in Switzerland.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro rose more than 1
percent against the dollar on Thursday after data on the U.S.
housing market and the euro zone manufacturing and services
sectors revived investors' appetite for risk.
 The yen erased most early gains versus the dollar and
dropped sharply against other currencies as U.S. stocks
rallied, helping improve sentiment a day after Federal Reserve
chairman Ben Bernanke painted a gloomy outlook for the U.S.
economy.
 ""Traders have reverted to risk-seeking mode this morning,""
said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in
New York, citing the rise against the yen on the U.S. housing
data. ""The dollar received a boost because the data was not
nearly as bad as everyone had feared and because the median
price of a home sold rose 1.0 percent.""
 U.S. existing home sales fell 5.1 percent in June, an
industry group reported, less than the 8.1 percent decline
expected according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nN22230580]
 The euro  was last up 1.1 percent at $1.2906, after
hitting a session peak at $1.2933 on electronic trading
platform EBS. It also gained 1.1 percent to 112.31 yen
.
 James Chen, chief technical strategist at FX Solutions said
the euro/dollar ""tentatively"" broke above resistance at $1.2900
and further gains are likely.
 ""If another attempt at a $1.3000 breach takes place, key
upside resistance on such a bullish move resides in the
significant $1.3100 price region,"" he said.
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 87.01 yen ,
rebounding from a session low of 86.35, according to Reuters
data.
 A survey showed the euro zone's private sector surged ahead
this month, with the pace of growth accelerating in both the

that European economic recovery appears to be well on track.""
 The dollar was trading down 1 percent versus a currency

 Attention focused on the release of European bank stress
test results, due at 1600 GMT on Friday, although some sources

anticipation of the test results, rising to a 10-week high
above $1.30 on Tuesday as traders bet most of the 91 European

 Some in the foreign exchange markets say the test results
could be positive for the euro if they reveal no unpleasant
surprises, but doubts linger whether the checks are tough or

 * Boeing says Farnborough highlights ""continuing recovery""
(Adds closing shares, final order tally)
 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, July 22 (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus pronounced the
recession over on Thursday after wrapping up a
busier-than-expected Farnborough Airshow with a $3 billion-plus
order for dozens of jets from Virgin boss Richard Branson.
 The British entrepreneur announced the preliminary Virgin
America order for 40 Airbus A320 jets, plus options for 20
more, by live video link beamed from his island in the
Caribbean.
 ""I am happy to celebrate my 60th birthday this week and I
can't think of a better present than getting 60 new planes,""
Branson told a news conference.
 Virgin Atlantic founder's order capped a rush of air show
orders for short- and medium-haul jets, which began with the
return of another aviation industry icon on Monday.
 Steve Udvar-Hazy, who created aircraft leasing in the
1970s, ordered 100 Airbus and Boeing jets for his new concern
Air Lease Corp, prompting a stampede of orders from other
financing firms.
 ""Ladies and gentlemen, the recession is definitely over,""
Airbus sales chief John Leahy told a news conference.
 ""Liquidity is back in the market, traffic is back in the
market and GDP growth is back,"" Leahy added.
 Chief Executive Tom Enders said Airbus would sell ""north of
400"" planes in 2010 compared with a previous target up to 300.
 Airbus unveiled net new orders for 130 planes worth over
$13 billion and Boeing 103 new orders worth over $10 billion.
They had a combined 176 provisional orders worth over $19
billion.
 Boeing hailed what it called a ""continuing recovery.""
 Aerospace shares in Europe rose sharply, led by Airbus
parent EADS which gained almost 6 percent. In mid-afternoon
U.S. trading Boeing Co shares rose about 6 percent.
 The optimism fed into a broad 2 percent share-market rally
as confidence was also boosted by encouraging earnings.
 ""It looks as though we have turned the corner and that is
why we are seeing strong growth,"" Airbus's Leahy said.
 He said airline figures showed that premium traffic was
rebounding after a slump during the financial crisis.
 ""It went down when investment bankers and lawyers got
fired, but they got hired back and planes are flying full
again.""
 SWAGGER RETURNS
 Leahy won a bet with EADS Chief Executive Louis Gallois by
doubling year-to-date orders at the show and had said on
Tuesday Airbus would top its order forecasts for 2010.
 Together with Branson and Udvar-Hazy, Leahy completes a
trio of charismatic dealmakers whose showmanship suggests the
industry has recovered a little swagger after months of
misery.
 But it was the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, making its debut
outside the United States, that stole the show out on the
tarmac in front of rows of temporary business chalets.
 Industry analysts welcomed the flow of orders, which also
boosted sales of regional jets but proved elusive for Canada's
Bombardier as it failed to find a new C-Series buyer.
 ""Orders have exceeded expectations,"" said U.S.-based
aerospace consultant Scott Hamilton of Leeham Company LLC. ""The
economy is coming back sooner than we thought.""
 The International Air Transport Association said this week
airlines were growing more confident as economic recovery took
hold, with financial performance at pre-crisis levels.
 Airbus said it was considering further increases in its
staple single-aisle A320-family production to cope with the
demand and may also increase production of larger planes.
 Other companies at the air show reported positive signs
from the market, though several executives were less forthright
when talking about the recovery, saying the lights remained on
amber.
 While emerging markets are driving most new business,
airlines in Europe and North America have yet to place big
bets.
 ""I'm worried about the overall strength of the economy
worldwide, especially places like Europe, which still have
deficit and credit problems that they are working their way
through,"" Rockwell Collin CEO Clay Jones told Reuters.
 Western defence firms were hit by fresh announcements of
spending cuts in their home markets this week, but reported a
steady flow of demand in Asia and the Middle East.

 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on
Thursday and the euro strengthened, backed by upbeat corporate
results, better-than-expected U.S. housing data, and an
improvement in European manufacturing and services activity.
 Expectations before the release of European banks' stress
test results appeared to show an easing of concerns as the
region's bank stocks ranked among the best performers.
 The increase in investors' risk appetite prompted some
selling of government bonds, while crude oil gained from a
combination of improving data and a weaker U.S. dollar. Gold
prices rose modestly, briefly edging back above $1,200.
 U.S. existing home sales fell less sharply than expected
in June. However the supply of unsold homes rose to the
highest amount in almost a year, the National Association of
Realtors said.
 ""Existing home sales, while still down, were not down as
much as expected. It's still a horrible number. It's just not
as horrible as what people were looking for. Do you really
view that as good news? Apparently the stock market does,""

 While Caterpillar raised its full-year outlook, citing
sales growth in emerging market mining and energy companies,
the bellwether company and Dow component cited ""significant
economic concerns,"" including the risk of a double-dip
recession in Europe and the United States.
 RALLY IN EUROPEAN BANK SHARES
 In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>

 European banks' shares advanced, with the sector focused
on the outcome of stress tests on how 91 banks would cope with
another economic slump and losses on government debt in the
wake of the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis.
 Shares of Barclays , HSBC , Societe

 Major listed lenders are expected to pass, while the tests
may show the biggest problems lie with smaller, mainly
unlisted players like Germany's Landesbanks and Spain's cajas.
[ID:nLDE66J0GP]
 ""There is hope that the stress test will take away a lot
of uncertainty surrounding European banks, but you have to
take into account that the ECB would not publish these results

 The dollar and U.S. Treasury bond yields came under
pressure on the prospect of further U.S. monetary easing.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke had said on
Wednesday the Fed stood ready to ease monetary policy further
if the budding U.S. economic recovery withers, describing the
outlook as ""unusually uncertain.""
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> fell 1.10 percent against a

 The euro rose 1.26 percent to $1.2917  after a

 * Orban wants to renegotiate EU budget goals
 * Calls for ""equal treatment"" for all EU states
 * Parliament passes bank tax as expected 
 
 By Gergely Szakacs and Krisztina Than
 (Adds parliament decision on bank tax, Bank Association)
 BUDAPEST, July 22 (Reuters) - Hungary's prime minister
signalled on Thursday that he would not renew a deal on an IMF
safety net and would row back on a commitment to cut the budget
deficit to European Union-prescribed levels next year.
 The comments from Viktor Orban, who took power in May with
the largest majority in Hungary's post-communist history, were
the latest in a string of statements that have stunned markets
and confounded a Europe-wide push towards spending cuts.
 Orban, who has shunned outside economic advice in favour of
a domestic agenda, has pledged to end the belt-tightening
pursued by the previous Socialist government. His eye appears to
be clearly on Oct. 3 municipal elections, where he can
consolidate his party's grip on Hungarian politics.
 Analysts said his centre-right Fidesz cabinet's rejection of
more austerity measures in favour of a ""pro-growth"" policy
including a tax on banks and possibly other businesses might be
softened after the municipal vote.
 But Orban has spurned warnings that Hungary could face
market pressure and currency weakness without support from its
lenders, and said the 20 billion euro ($25 billion) EU and
International Monetary Fund aid deal would expire in October.
 He said Hungary would meet its budget target under the
agreement but the issue of a new safety net was ""insignificant""
in light of more important negotiations with the EU about how
Hungary would bring its budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP.
 And in a move that could indicate a delay in budget
consolidation, he called for all EU states to follow the same
timeframe to reach the bloc's prescribed deficit limit of 3
percent.
 Some members may not achieve it until at least 2014.
 ""We will have a single demand, namely that of equal
treatment, that is, the same timeframe must be set for all to
meet the EU's expectation,"" Orban said.
 The EU and IMF suspended talks over the bailout package on
Saturday after Fidesz refused to abandon the bank tax, which the
Fund says will squeeze lending and hamper growth. It had called
for deeper structural reforms.
 Under Hungary's convergence plan submitted to the EU, it
agreed to cut its budget deficit to 3 percent by 2011 from a
target of 3.8 percent this year.
 The IMF said on Thursday it was ready to resume negotiations
with Hungary.
 Calling for ""terms the Hungarian people deserve"" and for the
country of 10 million to ""restore (its) lost economic
sovereignty"", Orban presented a bill to parliament that aims to
glean 200 billion forints ($892.4 million) from a tax on banks
both this year and in 2011.
 As expected, the law was passed, including the new financial
sector tax and a cut in the central bank governor's salary, with
301 votes in the 386-seat parliament. 
 Hungary's Banking Association chief Tamas Erdei told Reuters
the special bank tax could drive eight to 10 banks into the red
this year and should be phased out by 2012.
 
 CONFLICTING MESSAGES
 Emboldened by his election victory and austerity fatigue
among voters, Orban has shown little of the contrition expressed
by leaders in economically troubled Romania, Latvia, and other
formerly communist EU states worst hit by the global crisis.
 His approach has spooked investors already rattled by
problems in the euro zone periphery and the threat of a
double-dip recovery, although Thursday's reaction was mixed.
 The forint, which plunged more than 3 percent on Monday to
around 292 versus the euro -- levels last seen in May 2009 --
had climbed back to 283.80 by 1414 GMT on Thursday.
 The Finance Ministry sold all the bills it had put on offer
at a 12-month treasury bill auction, but yields rose, indicating
that markets remained skittish.
 Hungary is in no danger of default and has managed to put
its finances back in order since first having to grab the EU/IMF
lifeline in 2008.
 And Orban said that, with one of the EU's lowest budget
deficits, Hungary could hit the 3 percent of GDP budget deficit
level more easily than other EU states, which would strengthen
Budapest's credibility in markets.
 Analysts, however, have said Orban's conflicting messages to
domestic and international audiences have bruised his image in
the eyes of investors.
 ""At the moment, the market is buying into the idea that he
is posturing, given domestic political pressure,"" said Imran
Ahmed, emerging FX strategist at RBS.
 ""The hope is that ultimately ... he's fully aware of how
dependent Hungary is on external market support ... if the IMF
and Hungary can't reach an agreement and we still continue to
get this uncertainty, markets could get quite brutal.""
 Hungarian media said Fidesz could also enact a special tax
on telecoms and power firms. Economists say that might put the
2010 budget goal in reach but could hinder growth, undermine job
creation and postpone vital structural reforms.
 They say the bold attitude could backfire, as the EU would
not enter new aid talks without the IMF and it could also slap
Fidesz with sanctions for policies such as undermining the
independence of its central bank.
 ""The risks to Hungary are great if global risk sentiment
turns,"" said Nomura strategist Peter Attard Montalto.

 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmakers Eli Lilly and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co posted better-than-expected quarterly
earnings, withstanding tougher drug-price controls in Europe,
currency fluctuations and the costs of U.S. healthcare reform.
 Lilly posted the bigger second-quarter earnings beat,
fueled by cost controls and higher U.S. prices for many of its
top medicines. Bristol-Myers also relied heavily on cost
management, and enjoyed considerably lower taxes.
 Indianapolis-based Lilly earned $1.35 billion, or $1.22 per
share, compared with $1.16 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the
year-earlier period.
 Excluding items, it earned $1.24 per share, well above the
$1.10 per share forecast by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
 Company revenue jumped 9 percent to $5.75 billion, ahead of
Wall Street expectations of $5.58 billion. Sales would have

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly
on Thursday after stronger-than-expected European economic data
revived appetite for risk with a drop in U.S. lending rates
putting additional pressure on the currency.
 Adding to the dollar's losses was data showing new U.S.
claims for jobless benefits climbed more steeply than
anticipated last week. See [ID:nN21163086]
 The report followed other data earlier in the week showing
weakness in the housing sector and comments from Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who said on Wednesday that the
economic outlook as ""unusually uncertain.""
 ""The dollar has been undermined to a certain extent by the
string of weak U.S. data,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency
strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. ""At the same time, risk
appetite has been holding up fairly well. That's probably a
recipe for a weaker dollar at least in the near term.""
 In early New York trading, the dollar was trading down 0.7
percent versus a currency basket <.DXY> at 82.774 after
slipping to a low 82.624.
 The euro  rose over 1 percent from New York closing
levels to reach a session high of $1.2892 on electronic trading
platform EBS.
 The euro zone's private sector surged ahead this month,
according to a survey released on Thursday, confounding
expectations for a slowdown in growth. Separate data showed
euro zone industrial new orders rose in May at their fastest
annual rate in 10 years. See [ID:nSLALIE68S][ID:nBRQ009921]
 Attention focused on the release of European bank stress
test results, due at 1600 GMT on Friday although some sources
said they may be released earlier. [ID:nWEA0704]
 The euro has had a good run against the dollar in
anticipation of the test results, rising to a 10-week high
above $1.30 on Tuesday as traders bet most of the 91 European
banks being examined would pass. [ID:nLDE66K0YO]
 Some in the foreign exchange market say the test results
could be positive for the euro if they reveal no unpleasant
surprises, but doubts linger over whether the checks are tough
or transparent enough.
 ""The market has certainly bought the rumour going into this
week that the stress tests will be positive and people have
been going long euro/dollar, with weak U.S. economic data
making it look like a no-lose situation,"" said Lauren
Rosborough, currency strategist at Westpac.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 86.78 yen  after
slipping to 86.35, according to Reuters data.
 The rise in the yen, which gained steeply on the crosses on
Wednesday, has been hampered by caution that Japanese
policymakers may try to talk it down as it nears a 14-year high
around 85 yen per dollar hit last November.
 Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda said on Thursday
Japan wants to avoid excessive rises in the yen, but market
reaction was muted. [ID:nTOE66L012]
 Analysts said a fall in dollar lending rates was adding
pressure to the currency, as three-month dollar Libor fell
below 0.5 percent for the first time since May.

budget deficit below the EU's 3 percent ceiling in the future
but seeks equal treatment with other member states on a time
frame to achieve that target, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
 When asked if Hungary's government still intended to seek a
new precautionary deal with the IMF for 2011 and 2012 Orban said
this matter was insignificant now, as the main issue was to
reach a deal with the EU on bringing the budget gap below 3
percent.
 Followings are his key comments at a press conference after
meeting Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor. For a related

 TALKS WITH EU
 ""Our talks with the EU are not over. Hungary is a member of
the EU and all member states in the EU have undertaken to reduce
their deficits below a certain level, namely 3 percent.
 ""Hungary's deficit today based on this year's target is 3.8
percent, and we will achieve this. Hungary by the end of the
year will bring its deficit to 3.8 percent (of GDP) as it has
undertaken.
 ""But with this, the talks have not ended as the EU wants to
negotiate with us, as well as 20 other member states in the EU,
on how we will manage this 3 percent deficit. Hungary will be
part of these negotiations. This is called an Excessive Deficit
Procedure.""
 ""Shamefully, Hungary has been under this procedure for
almost six years now, and our shame is only slightly diminished
by several others falling next to us. Today, more than 20 states
are under the excessive deficit procedure.
 ""We want to agree with the EU. This is not going to be a
deal between Hungary and the EU, but a deal signed by all member
states, specifying when countries above the desirable deficit
level bring their deficits below 3 percent.
 ""We will negotiate this agreement along with the other
member states and as part of a budget policy based on equal
treatment, bring our deficit below 3 percent.
 ""Hungary has a good chance for this as in terms of the
deficit we are the fifth or sixth best performer. It will be
easier for us to reach the 3 percent than those sates with 7, 8,
9, 10 or 11 percent (deficits).
 ""The Hungarian economy can boldly undertake this position in
talks with the EU. We will have a single demand, namely that of
equal treatment, that is, the same timeframe must be set for all
to meet the EU's expectation.
 ""In the next few weeks and months Hungary will hold talks
with the EU ... and the IMF, as it has ended its mission and the
agreement has expired, will deal with countries in need of the
IMF's direct support.
 ""We are running a deficit of 3.8 percent and state debt,
although high, it is in the middle of the field on a European
comparison.
 ""We hope economic growth next year will be above 2 percent
... and we plan further tax cuts that will boost the economy, so
we have a good chance that, based on the agreements with the EU,
Hungary will again become a successful country.
 
 WHEN ASKED IF HUNGARY INTENDS TO SEEK NEW IMF DEAL:
 ""The important question is an agreement with the EU,
everything else is secondary or insignificant.
 ""We want to talk with everybody, we want to consult with
everybody, in our mind the IMF is by far not the devil
incarnate, we are happy to talk to them as well. But we must
agree with the EU. Let me stress, it is not should, but must
(agree with the EU).
 ""And we must agree on terms that the Hungarian people
deserve.
 ""If we agree with the EU and it becomes clear that it will
be easier for us than other states to achieve the 3 percent
deficit, that will strengthen Hungary's credibility in markets
to an extent that will make debt financing easier.
 ""In 2011 and 2012 we must pay back the money we got from the
IMF. The Hungarian economy must be strong enough to do that and
it will be strong enough.
 ""What Hungary needs is a uniform European agreement based on
equal treatment, applicable to all member states exceeding the
(EU's) deficit level. Until this agreement is reached, it would
be unwise to speak about levels and timeframes, moreover, it
would be irresponsible.""

 By Farah Master
 SHANGHAI, July 22 (Reuters) - Global trade, in volume terms,
is expected to grow more than 10 percent this year, Pascal Lamy,
director-general of the World Trade Organisation, said on
Thursday.
 The forecast is up from an estimate of 9.5 percent in March.
 ""It will probably pick up 10 to 10-plus percent this year
depending on what happens in the second half of the year,"" Lamy
said speaking at the UN pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo.
 ""Trade is picking up as vigorously as it decreased in 2009,""
he said, cautioning that the outlook for the second half of the
year remained shaky.
 When asked about countries resorting to protectionist
measures during the crisis, Lamy said China had complied with
its WTO obligations.
 ""If we had a wave of protectionism during this crisis, China
would have been victim number one and because we had nothing of
this kind, China is winner number one.""
 Lamy said negotiations on the Doha round of trade talks were
ongoing and it was not clear when a resolution could be
expected.
 ""There still remains a question whether WTO members can
conclude the negotiation and we only have the answer to this
question at the very last minute.""
 The Doha talks, launched in late 2001, are deadlocked
largely over differences between the United States and the big
emerging economies of China, Brazil and India.

 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly on
Thursday as better-than-forecast European economic data boosted
equities and spurred appetite for risk, with a drop in U.S.
lending rates putting additional pressure on the currency.
 The dollar had earlier fallen close to a seven-month low
against the yen, hit last week, on downbeat comments from

the U.S. economic outlook was ""unusually uncertain"".

 Analysts said a fall in dollar lending rates was adding
pressure to the currency, as three-month dollar Libor fell below
0.5 percent for the first time in two-months. [ID:nEAP000040]
 The dollar fell to a 2-month low versus the high-yielding

Further barriers were reported at $0.8900.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro zone's private sector
surged in July, data showed on Thursday, confounding forecasts
and contrasting with renewed concern about the U.S. economy
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic
outlook was ""unusually uncertain"".
 European purchasing managers' indexes showed private sector
business activity accelerated in July, surprising economists who
had expected a slowdown and indicating third-quarter euro zone
growth of around 0.6-0.7 percent, analysts said. That would be
double forecasts in a Reuters poll last week for 0.3 percent
growth.
 The data came a day after Bernanke warned the U.S. economic
outlook was ""unusually uncertain"" and indicated further monetary
easing might be necessary to support the world's biggest
economy. It also came on the heels of news last week of a slight
moderation in China's runaway economic growth in the second
quarter.
 Ken Wattret at BNP Paribas, however, warned that while the
euro zone data was bullish, mainly due to Germany and France,
final purchasing managers' surveys at the end of the month,
which will include euro zone peripheral economies, would not be
as upbeat.
 ""My big issue is whether there will be a slowdown in the
second half of the year and on the basis of what we are hearing
from the U.S. economy and signs of a cooling off in China, I
think it is very likely we will see a slowdown,"" Wattret said.
 A Reuters poll of more than 600 economists published last
week suggested the world economy will cool a bit in the next few
months as China and the United States gear down.
 While many major central banks have started looking at exit
strategies from their loose monetary policies -- Canada,
Australia and India have already raised interest rates --
Bernanke said on Wednesday the Fed stood ready to ease monetary
policy further if the recovery falters.
 The U.S. economy resumed growth about a year ago, but
stubbornly high unemployment, a fresh drop in housing activity
and a slowdown in manufacturing have raised fears of a
""double-dip"" recession there. A Reuters poll last week said the
chance of a dip back into recession was 15 percent.
 U.S. existing home sales and jobless claims data, all due on
Thursday, will give further clues about the health of the U.S.
economy.
 
 CHINA SLOWDOWN
China's growth moderated to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter from 11.9 percent in the first quarter and a Reuters
poll of economists this month forecast 10 percent growth overall
this year.
 The slowdown in China has fuelled market expectations that
Beijing might also hold off tightening policy or even announce
new stimulus measures.
 And the Bank of England, which has slashed rates to record
lows and injected billions of pounds into the money supply,
discussed further easing as well as tightening at its last
policy-setting meeting, according to minutes released on
Wednesday.
 ""The traditional balancing act has become much more acute,""
the Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, was quoted
as saying in the Independent newspaper on Thursday.
 ""It has the flavour of the challenges we faced in 2008 --
substantial downside risks to growth but also upside risks to
inflation staying above target and feeding through into wages
and price setting.""
 EUROPEAN BOUNCE
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services PMI, made up of surveys of
2,000 businesses ranging from hotels to banks, jumped to 56.0 in
July from 55.5 in June, easily outpacing expectations for 55.0
and beating out even the most optimistic forecast polled by
Reuters for 55.5.
 The euro zone's manufacturing sector, which drove a large
part of the economy's return to growth in the third quarter of
last year, also accelerated.
 ""Overall, some encouragement that the recovery in Germany
and the core euro zone has momentum. But concerns about the
(euro zone) periphery are set to linger, if not deepen,"" said
Ben May at Capital Economics.
 While the euro zone economy has emerged from its worst
post-war recession it grew only 0.2 percent between January and
March, after a paltry 0.1 percent expansion in the final three
months of 2009.
 It is expected to have grown 0.6 percent in the second
quarter but growth is seen slowing to 0.3 percent later in the
year.

 * Says yuan can rise or fall against any one currency
 * To aid shift in thinking, PBOC mulls publishing yuan NEER
 By Simon Rabinovitch and Zhou Xin
 BEIJING, July 22 (Reuters) - China on Thursday sent its
clearest signal yet that it is determined to steer the value of
the yuan in relation to a basket of currencies, not the dollar.
 Hu Xiaolian, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China,
said the central bank might start to publish the yuan's nominal
exchange rate measured against the currencies of China's trading
partners in order to lessen an excessive focus on the yuan's
worth in dollars.
 What's more, Hu flagged that managing the yuan according to a
basket might entail permitting the currency to fall against the
dollar depending on market conditions -- something that would be
sure to ring alarm bells in Washington.
 ""The yuan will move up or down against a single currency,
showing two-way movement, but the exchange rate will maintain
overall stability at a reasonable and balanced level,"" she said
in an essay posted on the central bank's website, www.pbc.gov.cn.
 Hu said it was the yuan's value against a basket rather than
any one currency -- in other words, the dollar -- that was
critical for adjusting China's exports and imports and its
external payments.
 Xing Ziqiang, an economist at China International Capital
Corp in Beijing, said the purpose of the statement was to quash
the assumption that the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB),
was a one-way bet to head ever higher against the dollar.
 ""The move is aimed at changing the narrow mentality of
investors that de-pegging from the dollar can only mean that the
Chinese currency will rise,"" Xing said. ""It will help to ease
strong expectations of yuan appreciation and prevent rampant
speculation on international markets.""
 To kill the habit of focusing solely on the dollar, the PBOC
would ""try"" to publish the yuan's nominal effective exchange rate
on a regular basis and thus gradually establish it as the
benchmark and reference for managing the currency, Hu said.
 Doing so should not be difficult. The Bank of International
Settlements already produces a nominal and real, or
inflation-adjusted, effective exchange rate series for the yuan.
 LOTS OF MESSAGES
 Stephen Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered
in Shanghai, said Beijing has always focused on the dollar/yuan
rate because China's exports were mostly invoiced in dollars.
 Diverting attention to the trade-weighted exchange rate was
commendable because it ought to lead to a more rational debate
about the real value of the currency, Green said.
 ""If they want to really pursue, from an economics point of
view, a policy of basic stability, then that implies quite a lot
of renminbi/dollar volatility.
 ""Their problem at the moment is that basic stability means
renminbi/dollar stability, which in actual fact isn't very stable
at all. So the central bank has got to change the terms of the
debate,"" he added.
 Xu Biao, an economist with China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen,
said one clear message from Hu's essay was that a rapid rise in
the yuan was not going to happen.
 The yuan has risen just 0.7 percent against the dollar since
Beijing ended a 23-month-old peg to the U.S. currency on June 19.
 ""It is not realistic to expect Chiana to let the yuan
strengthen significantly,"" Xu said.
 Coincidence or not, Hu's comments were posted a day after
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke handed fresh ammunition to
China's critics in Congress by saying Beijing effectively
subsidised Chinese exports by holding down the yuan.
[ID:nN21183994]
 Xu said Hu's essay was aimed at taking some of the consequent
pressure off the yuan to rise.
 ""It's telling the outside world: please don't always look at
the yuan/dollar rate; look at the nominal effective rate,"" Xu
said.
 When Beijing freed the yuan on June 19, many economists
played down the PBOC's reaffirmation of its July 2005 declaration
that it intended to manage the exchange rate with reference to a
basket of currencies.
 These economists were convinced that China in fact tracked
the dollar between 2005 and 2008 and would continue to do so.
 Other analysts, however, insisted just as forcefully that
this time it was different and the PBOC would be switching to
targeting a trade-weighted basket.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The dollar fell close to a
seven-month low against the yen on Thursday on downbeat comments
from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, while better-than-
forecast euro zone data buoyed the euro.
 Bernanke said the U.S. economic outlook was ""unusually
uncertain"" and that the Fed was ready to ease monetary policy
further if necessary, sending the two-year U.S. Treasury yield
to a record low and diminishing the allure of the dollar versus
the yen.
 The dollar also fell versus the euro, with traders citing
earlier buying of the single currency by east European accounts
and a western European corporate, while data showing a jump in
euro zone manufacturing and services activity and in industrial
output lifted sentiment.
 Attention focused on the release of European bank stress
test results, due at 1600 GMT on Friday although some sources
said they may be released earlier.
 The euro has had a good run against the dollar in
anticipation of the test results, rising to a 10-week high above
$1.30 on Tuesday as, traders bet most of the 91 European banks
being examined would pass.
 Some in the foreign exchange market say the test results
could be positive for the euro if they reveal no unpleasant
surprises, but doubts linger over whether the checks are tough
or transparent enough. 
 ""The market has certainly bought the rumour going into this
week that the stress tests will be positive and people have been
going long euro/dollar, with weak U.S. economic data making it
look like a no-lose situation,"" said Lauren Rosborough, currency
strategist at Westpac.
 She said the euro was likely to see a short-lived rally
after the results, which could turn to selling next week as
market participants concluded after the tests that the problems
facing euro zone peripheral countries have not gone away.
 At 0943 GMT, the euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.2824, well
above an earlier session low of $1.2739, though traders said it
ran into offers around the $1.2850 area, keeping it below the
previous day's highs above $1.29.
 Against the yen, the euro recovered from earlier falls,
trading up 0.1 percent at 111.16 yen, having earlier hit a
two-week low around 110.03.
 
 DOLLAR FALLS VS YEN
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 86.72 yen, extending
losses after a 0.5 percent fall on Wednesday, on a mixture of
Japanese exporter offers and hedging selling related to some
currency-linked structured notes.
 Traders said the dollar could fall fast if it broke below a
seven-month trough of 86.27 yen hit last week, with stop-loss
dollar offers believed to be waiting below that level.
 However, Yuki Sakasai, a forex strategist at Barclays
Capital in Tokyo, said it was unlikely to fall much below the
seven-month low for now.
 ""What Bernanke has said is essentially the same as the
minutes (of the Fed's June 22-23 meeting). So his comments alone
are unlikely to push the dollar/yen below recent trading
ranges,"" Sakasai said.
 The rise in the yen, which gained steeply on the crosses on
Wednesday, has been hampered by caution that Japanese
policymakers may try to talk it down as it nears a 14-year high
around 85 yen per dollar hit last November.
 Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda said on Thursday
Japan wants to avoid excessive rises in the yen, but market

expect to gain market share.""
 Limet, whose company was launched in November in an effort
by GSK and Pfizer to fight the dominance of Californian biotech
Gilead in the HIV drug market, said ViiV like others was being
pressed by Europe's move to cut medicine prices.
 ""Various governments have taken various measures in Europe
which have an impact on our activities,"" he said. ""But
they...are not...focused on any particular therapy area. HIV
treatments are part of the pharmaceutical deals by the those
governments, so that is something we have to face.""
 ViiV has around 19 percent of the global AIDS drug market,
while Gilead has around 30 percent. 
 ""The goal is not to look at market share now, it is to look
at what we can do tomorrow,"" Limet said. ""We are focusing our
best efforts to be able to sustain our research and development,
to be able to sustain our access strategies and to prepare for
gaining market share from 2012 onwards.""
 Around 33.4 million people are infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, many of them in
sub-Saharan Africa. The virus is incurable, but many patients in
wealthy nations are able to live with it by taking cocktails of
AIDS drugs to manage their condition.
 GSK and its partner Shionogi said on Wednesday they were
progressing a ViiV drug known as '572 against HIV into
final-stage clinical testing, ramping up competition in a class
of AIDS drugs known as integrase inhibitors.
 Industry analysts believe '572 could reach the market in
2013, assuming it performs well in the next phase of testing.
 Limet said he was confident '572 would compete well against
rivals from Merck & Co -- which has an established integrase
inhibitor drug called Insentress which sold $752 million last
year -- and Gilead, whose rival product called elvitegravir is
in late-stage trials.
 ""I really believe that with this new integrase inhibitor we
have a very, very promising new drug,"" Limet said. 
 ""It is very potent, we have less resistance problems, it's a
once-a-day formulation, and this is a product that doesn't
require a booster, which means that the potential side-effects
are also reduced.""
 New data on '572 are due to be released at the Vienna
conference later on Thursday.
 GSK is the dominant partner in ViiV, reflecting its stronger
market position, and has an initial 85 percent stake in the new
group, while Pfizer holds 15 percent.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2010 04:48AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Capitalisation estimates for European banks," (Adds Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale estimates)
 
 LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - With the results of stress tests
on 91 European banks looming, financial institutions have been
coming up with their own scenarios of what to expect.
 How financial markets react to Friday's results may well
depend on the expectations of analysts.
 The following comments and capitalisation estimates come
from recent bank notes and/or interviews. For a factbox on which
individual banks are expected to have passed or failed, click on
[ID:nLDE66J0GP].
 
 GOLDMAN SACHS - Overall capitalisation need of 38 billion
euros ($49 billion) for European banks.
 Goldman conducted a survey of 376 investors and others to
gauge what the consensus for the results might be. Participants
expected an 89 percent pass rate among the 91 banks and an
overall need of 38 billion euros in capitalisation.
 Nine percent of respondents expected a need to raise less
than 10 billion euros, 33 percent between 10 billion and 25
billion euros, 35 percent between 25 billion and 50 billion
euros, 18 percent between 50 billion and 100 billion euros, and
5 percent above 100 billion euros.
 A majority of 63 percent said that the amount of capital
raised will leave banks adequately (or overly) capitalised,
while 37 percent saw a capital deficit even after the stress
test.
 
 SOCIETE GENERALE - Overall capitalisation need of 30 billion
euros.
 Michala Marcussen, head of economics at the investment bank,
told Reuters journalists at a briefing that her bank calculated
the stress tests would show banks having to take potential
writedowns in a crisis of between 175 billion and 250 billion
euros.
 That would lead to a recapitalisation need of 30 billion
euros, something the bank believes to me ""manageable"".

 DEUTSCHE BANK - Overall capitalisation need of 24 billion
euros to 83 billion euros by 60 European banks.
 The bank conducted a partial stress test on the loan books
of 60 European banks (excluding quasi-public banks such as
Spanish cajas and German landesbanks).
 It concluded that the banks would need 24 billion euros
under a moderate scenario and 83 billion under a severe scenario
similar to the post-Lehman collapse. That equates to 3 percent
to 10 percent of aggregate tangible equity.
 Looking at market reaction, Deutsche said:
 ""If the official releases confirm DB's results, and are seen
as sufficiently credible, we see further room for financial
credit spreads to outperform and would expect some additional
relief rally in equities and risky assets in general.
 ""This would be an important development in supporting
consumer sentiment and global growth prospects.""
 
 NOMURA - Overall need of 75 billion euros.
 The Japanese bank conducted its own tests on European banks,
reckoning it had been tougher than the official tests will be.
 It estimated the banks would have a capital shortfall of 75
billion euros but suggested that it was the ranking of banks
that would matter to the markets more than the overall number.
 Nomura said Swiss, UK and Nordic banks would be in the best
position mainly due to lower expected losses and a higher
capital buffer. Greek banks, due to high domestic debt holdings,
and Italian banks would be among the worst.
 ""In Germany, Deutsche Bank positions well compared with
Postbank and Commerzbank while French banks, like the Italian
banks, are arguably penalised by the lengthy period to write off
(non-performing loans),"" it concluded.
 
 CREDIT SUISSE - Overall need of 90 billion euros.
 The bank noted that financial markets seemed to be
relatively optimistic about the results.
 Its equity research department estimated that 90 billion
euros would be needed in recapitalisation, but that this
compared with 130 billion euros of readily available capacity.
 
 BARCLAYS CAPITAL - Spain's cajas to need 36 billion euros,
German landesbanks 34 billion euros, Greek banks 8.6 billion
euros.
 The bank said the cajas, landesbanks and Greek banks were
the institutions most likely to fail and therefore to need to
raise new capital.
 But it noted its estimates were based on a number of
assumptions and were designed more to compare the potential
capital needs with the programmes in place to address them than
to predict the exact results of the tests.
 
 UBS - Spain at risk
 The Swiss bank took a specific look at Spain, one of the
peripheral euro zone economies seen as most vulnerable to debt
problems.
 It suggested Spanish bonds were facing a double risk from
the stress tests.
 The results could be seen as not credible if they were too
low -- a recapitalisation need of less than 15-20 billion
euros, for example.
 Alternatively, UBS said, if a large number of more than
50-60 billion euros were needed, markets could be concerned
about Spain's ability to finance a good portion of it.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - World stocks bounced on Thursday
while the euro gained broadly as investors grew more optimistic
the looming results of stress tests on European banks were
unlikely to send shockwaves through markets.
 Better-than-expected euro zone data on manufacturing and
services activity also helped improve sentiment a day after
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke painted a gloomy outlook
for the U.S. economy, which had weighed on risky assets.
 Banks were one of the best performing sectors in Europe
ahead of the publication of stress tests expected by Friday.
Major listed lenders are expected to pass, while the tests may
show the biggest problems lie with smaller, mainly unlisted
players like Germany's Landesbanks and Spain's cajas.

 Strong second-quarter earnings results from Morgan Stanley
on Wednesday also underscored the positive sentiment.
 ""There's just generally a bit more optimism, particularly
considering Morgan Stanley's results yesterday were absolutely
amazing,"" said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index.
 ""Also there's been some betting from clients that the stress
test results aren't going to be as bad as the market had feared
some weeks ago.""
The MSCI world equity index rose 0.4 percent while the
Thomson Reuters global stock index gained two thirds of a
percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.4 percent.
 Emerging stocks erased early losses to stand steady on the
day. U.S. stock futures rose around 1.2 percent, pointing to a
firmer open on Wall Street.
 U.S. crude oil rose half a percent to $76.92 a barrel,
supported by forecasts for a fourth consecutive weekly drop in
U.S. crude inventories.
 
 BERNANKE HITS DOLLAR
 The dollar and U.S. yields came under pressure on the
prospect of further U.S. monetary tightening. Bernanke said the
Fed stood ready to ease monetary policy further if the budding
U.S. economy recovery withers, describing the outlook as
""unusually uncertain"".
 Two-year U.S. Treasury yields briefly matched a record low
of 0.556 percent hit the previous day, while the benchmark
10-year yield held near a 15-month low of 2.855 percent.
 The dollar was down 0.7 percent against a basket of major
currencies while it fell 0.2 percent to 86.77 yen, edging closer
to last week's seven-month low of 86.25.
 The euro rose 0.8 percent to $1.2855 after a survey showed
the euro zone's private sector surged in July.
 European purchasing managers' indexes showed private sector
business activity accelerated in July, surprising economists who
had expected a slowdown and indicating third quarter euro zone
growth of around 0.6-0.7 percent, analysts said.
 Bund futures were steady.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The euro zone's private sector
surged ahead this month, according to a survey released on
Thursday, confounding expectations for a slowdown in growth and
further quelling concerns about a double-dip recession.
 Both the services and manufacturing sectors saw the pace of
growth accelerate and firms took on more workers but survey
compiler Markit warned in a teleconference that it might be a
temporary boost from the recent soccer World Cup.
 ""We were very surprised, it's a good start to the second
half of the year ... but we still really suspect that an easing
in GDP growth is on the cards for the second half of the year,""
said Chris Williamson at Markit.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from
hotels to banks, jumped to 56.0 in July from 55.5 in June,
easily outpacing expectations for 55.0 and beating out even the
most optimistic forecast polled by Reuters for 55.5.
 The euro zone's manufacturing sector, which drove a large
part of the economy's return to growth in the third quarter of
last year, also saw the pace of growth accelerate.
 The flash manufacturing index climbed to 56.5 in July from
55.6 in June, confounding forecasts for a fall to 55.2, while
the output index leapt to 58.3 this month, from 57.2 in June.
 The composite index, made up from the services and
manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,
rose to 56.7 this month from 56.0 in June, also confounding
expectations for a decline to 55.5.
""We were consistent with 0.6-0.7 percent GDP growth in the
second quarter and the output reading here is a just a touch
above the average for the second quarter,"" Williamson said,
adding: ""For the euro zone as a whole it suggests a double dip
will be avoided.""
 A Reuters poll earlier this month also said the chance of a
dip back into recession had receded. [ECILT/EU]
 The euro zone economy escaped from its worst post-war
recession in the third quarter of last year and data released
earlier this month confirmed the economy grew 0.2 percent
between January and March after a paltry 0.1 percent expansion
in the final three months of 2009.
 It is expected to have grown a healthier 0.6 percent in the
second quarter but slow to growth of just 0.3 percent per
quarter through to the middle of next year. 
 The economy is seen growing 1.3 percent next year, compared
to 2011 forecasts for 2.0 percent in major trading partner
Britain and 2.8 percent for the United States, the world's
biggest economy. [ECILT/GB] [ECILT/US]
 
 NEW ORDERS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES
 The manufacturing sector's new orders index soared to 57.2
this month from 55.9 in June as market conditions improved and
on higher sales to the U.S. and buoyant Asian economies.
 Exports will have been boosted by a weak euro , which
has been battered by fears over the debts of Greece and other
euro area members. The single currency hit a four-year trough
last month.
 Data released last week showed the euro zone swung to a
trade deficit in May as a rebound in global demand for euro zone
goods meant exports surged year-on-year but by much less than
imports. The jump in imports is likely to signal higher domestic
demand, boding well for economic recovery.
 Germany, the 16 nation-bloc's biggest economy, saw its
services sector grow at its fastest pace in almost three years
while its manufacturing sector saw growth pick up to a pace not
far off April's 14-year survey high.
 Neighbouring France, the second biggest economy, saw a
further upturn in its services sector but the pace of growth in
its manufacturing sector slowed. 
 The euro zone service sector employment index rose to 51.7
this month, from 50.8 in June, its highest since April 2008 and
its third month above the break-even point.
 The composite output price index rose to 49.8 this month, up
from June's 49.4, suggesting there was less need for businesses
to cut prices to drum up business.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, July 22 (Reuters) - The dollar slid close to a
seven-month low against the yen on Thursday after Federal
Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. economic outlook was
""unusually uncertain"", sparking a sell-off in riskier assets.
 Bernanke said the Fed stood ready to ease monetary policy
further if the economy worsened, sending two-year U.S. Treasury
yields to a record low, which reduced the allure of the dollar
versus the yen.
 The euro, which fell sharply after the comments sparked
outflows from stocks and other risk assets, hit a two-week low
against the yen. It edged up versus the dollar but stayed
towards the bottom of its recent range before Europe's bank
stress test results on Friday.
 ""The yen is gaining after Bernanke on risk aversion and as
an interest rate play in reaction to U.S. yields falling further
and rate differentials moving in favour of the yen,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 At 0730 GMT, the dollar was down 0.6 percent at 86.56 yen,
extending losses after a 0.5 percent fall on Wednesday, on a
mixture of Japanese exporter offers and hedging selling related
to some currency-linked structured notes.
 Traders said the dollar could fall fast if it breaks below a
seven-month trough of 86.27 yen hit last week, with stop-loss
dollar offers believed to be waiting below that level. 
 However, Yuki Sakasai, a forex strategist at Barclays
Capital in Tokyo, said the dollar/yen rate was unlikely to fall
much below the seven-month low for now.
 ""What Bernanke has said is essentially the same as the
minutes (of the Fed's June 22-23 meeting). So his comments alone
are unlikely to push the dollar/yen below recent trading
ranges,"" Sakasai said.
 The rise in the yen, which gained steeply on the crosses on
Wednesday, has been hampered by caution that Japanese policy
makers may try to talk it down as it nears a 14-year high around
85 yen per dollar hit last November.
 Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda said on Thursday
Japan wants to avoid excessive rises in the yen, but market
reaction was muted.
 Yen gains came as the yield spread of two-year U.S bonds
over Japanese government debt fell to a 15-month low.

 STRESS TESTS
 The euro fell 0.3 percent against the yen to 110.75 yen,
having hit a two-week low around 110.03 yen, though traders said
there were bids around the 110 yen level.
 Against the dollar the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.2773,
though it stayed well below the previous day's highs above
$1.29. Traders said it had some support at its 14-day moving
average around $1.2742 and around $1.2720, a July 9 high.
 Sentiment towards the euro was helped by better-than-
expected German purchasing managers' surveys on manufacturing
and services. Figures for the euro zone as a whole were due at
0758 GMT.
 The euro has had a good run against the dollar in recent
weeks, rising to a 10-week high above $1.30 on Tuesday as
traders began to bet most of the 91 European banks being
examined would pass the stress tests.
 Major listed banks, which face constant investor scrutiny,
are expected to pass, but the tests may show the worst problems
lie with smaller players such as Spanish cajas and German
landesbanks, which are mainly unlisted.
 Euro/dollar 1-month risk reversals, a measure of currency
sentiment, showed a slight bias for euro puts.
 Traders said that partly reflected fears among traders that
the euro may start falling after the bank stress test results.

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 22 (Reuters) - The dollar slid towards a recent
seven-month low versus the yen on Thursday after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke expressed concern about the U.S. economy
but steered clear of hinting about further easing as some had
hoped.
 The euro, which lost sharply after his comments sparked
outflows from stocks and other risk assets, held steady at lower
levels ahead of Europe's bank stress test results on Friday.
 Bernanke, in testimony prepared for delivery to the Senate
Banking Committee, said the U.S. economy faces ""unusually
uncertain"" prospects.
 ""That 'unusually uncertain' phrase from Bernanke was very
strong, prompting investors to sell stocks and buy government
bonds,"" said a trader at a big Japanese bank.
 ""But in the forex market, investors are unable to react much
before the stress test results, the market's main focus.""
 Although Bernanke said the Fed was ready to take further
steps to bolster growth if needed, analysts said lack of clarity
on what measures it could take prompted investors to reduce risk
positions, benefiting the low-yielding yen across the board.
 The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 86.47 yen, extending losses
after a 0.5 percentage point fall on Wednesday, on a mixture of
offers from Japanese exporters and hedging selling related to
some currency-linked structured notes.
 Traders said the dollar could fall fast if it breaks below a
seven-month trough of 86.27 yen hit last week, with stop-loss
dollar offers believed to be waiting below that level.
 A relentless drop in U.S. bond yields is also reducing the
allure of the dollar in comparison with the yen.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield fell to a record low
around 0.56 percent following Bernanke's comments, shrinking the
yield spread of two-year U.S bonds over Japanese government debt
to a fresh 15-month low.
 Others were less convinced about the likelihood of further
falls in the dollar.
 The pair's 14-day relative strength index is at 33, near the
30 mark considered to indicate an oversold market.
 Yuki Sakasai, a forex strategist at Barclays Capital, said
the dollar/yen rate was unlikely to fall much below the
seven-month low for now.
 ""What Bernanke has said is essentially the same as the
minutes (of the Fed's June 22-23 meeting). So his comments alone
are unlikely to push the dollar/yen below recent trading ranges,""
Sakasai said.
 The rise in the yen, which gained steeply on the crosses on

makers may try to talk it down as it nears a 14-year high around
85 yen per dollar hit last November.
 Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda said on Thursday Japan
wants to avoid excessive rises in the yen, but market reaction
was muted.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.2781, winning some reprieve
after having lost nearly 1 percent on Wednesday on Bernanke's
comments and tepid demand at a Portuguese debt sale.
 It has some support at its 14-day moving average around
$1.2742 and around $1.2720, a July 9 high.
 The currency is likely to consolidate around the current
levels, as few traders will be eager to push it higher before the
European Union unveils the stress tests on euro zone banks.
 The euro has had a good run against the dollar in recent
weeks, rising to a 10-week high above $1.30 on Tuesday as traders
began to bet most of the 91 European banks being examined would
pass the tests.
 European policy makers have expressed confidence their banks
will pass, although some analysts say investors remain sceptical
about the severity of the checks.
 Major listed banks, which face constant investor scrutiny,
are expected to pass, but the tests may show the worst problems
lie with smaller players such as Spanish cajas and German
landesbanks, which are mainly unlisted.
 Euro/dollar 1-month risk reversal, a measure of currency
sentiment, showed a slight bias for euro puts.

standing at 1.25/1.75%, its highest since early July.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2010 01:04AM ET</span>",Obama budget review may trim 2010 deficit forecast," * Gains to come from TARP but long-term outlook tough
 * Review may revise U.S. growth, employment forecasts
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - The Obama administration
may report somewhat better fiscal news when it delivers its
mid-session budget review later this week, but the United
States still faces a massive deficit and rising debt.
 Higher corporate taxes and Wall Street's quick repayment of
a taxpayer bailout could see the projected 2010 U.S. budget
deficit fall a bit when the review is released on Friday.
 However, the fiscal funding gap would still be the widest
on record, highlighting the tough task faced by President
Barack Obama's Democrats as they try to placate voter anger
over government spending in an election year.
 Obama's economic team will update forecasts for the deficit
and debt over the next decade, while revising estimates for the
pace of growth and level of unemployment.
 If the economic outlook is dimmed, as some analysts expect,
that would further darken a long-term U.S. fiscal picture that
already projects debt climbing above 70 percent of GDP.
 Investors tend to focus on the long-term outlook, although
U.S. government bond yields remain low despite the country's
fiscal challenges, signaling markets so far believe Obama's
pledge to tackle the deficit and debt going forward.
 On the other hand, the White House will have the benefit of
some more positive short-term news to deliver on Friday.
 Analysts expect the deficit for the fiscal year to Sept. 30
to decline from the record $1.56 trillion funding gap projected
in Obama's February budget.
 ""My guess is ... that the deficit number will in fact be a
little lower than it had previously been projected, maybe by
$100 billion or so,"" said Stan Collender, a partner at Qorvis
Communications and longtime budget watcher who served on a
commission during the 1990s to study budget issues.
 If the 2010 deficit came in at $1.45 trillion, it would
still be the widest on record, followed by the $1.41 trillion
deficit in 2009.
 Some observers see the scale of the short-term deficit as
academic, considering the severe recession from which the
country is still recovering. But they want more convincing
White House efforts to phase in budget controls in the future.

of this mess. And we still don't,"" said Maya MacGuineas,
president for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
 Obama has established a fiscal commission to weigh how to
tackle the deficit and debt. The 18-strong bipartisan panel is
expected to recommend a mixture of tax increases and spending
cuts when its report is delivered by the end of December.
 Critics are skeptical it will be able to forge a genuine
consensus on how to proceed that will survive the Nov. 2
midterm congressional elections. They also doubt U.S. lawmakers
will be prepared to enact the politically painful measures the
commission recommends when they are presented to Congress.
 Obama spoke to these doubts on Tuesday when he praised the
open-minded spirit maintained so far by his commissioners.
 ""I think it is going to be a good report. But it is still
going to require some tough choices, and we're committed to
pursuing those tough choices after we get that report,"" he told
a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David
Cameron. Cameron has split ways with Obama and announced severe
austerity measures to curb Britain's own towering debts.
 In the meantime, the White House may be able to argue the
U.S. budget is already moving in the right direction.
 Monthly updates from the Treasury show the budget deficit
over the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 has accumulated to
$1.004 trillion, or only two thirds of the initial projection
with three quarters of the time elapsed.
 Part of the boost to 2010 revenues could be higher
corporate tax revenues, due to stronger profits.
 But the big difference is seen coming from the
lower-than-expected costs of the Troubled Asset Relief Program,
created by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, to save big
U.S. banks during the financial crisis.
 TARP's initial $700 billion price tag has been slashed and
now stands at $105.4 billion -- $11.4 billion less than at the
time of Obama's February budget -- while $198.4 had been paid
back to the U.S. Treasury by the end of June.
 Analysts say this is positive for the short-term budget
picture but is by definition providing only temporary relief.
 ""People are paying it back and it is a positive. ... That
just needs to be understood in the right context. The banks can
only repay the TARP funds once,"" said Alex Brill, a research
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.

 * Forecast up from 8.5 pct growth predicted late last year
 * No need for extra stimulus steps -economist
(Adds more economists' views on growth)
 BEIJING/SHANGHAI, July 22 (Reuters) - China is expected to
maintain strong growth in the rest of this year and there is no
need for a second stimulus, government economists said in
remarks published on Thursday.
 The State Information Center, a think tank under the
National Development and Reform Commission, forecast economic
growth of 9.5 percent this year, which would be close to the
average for the past 30 years and reflect China's reasonable
growth potential, the official China Securities Journal
reported.
 Last November, the centre said it expected the Chinese
economy to grow 8.5 percent in 2010 and it repeated that
forecast in December.
 Separately, Wang Yiming, deputy head of the Academy of
Macroeconomic Research, also under the powerful economic
planner, told the official People's Daily overseas edition that
he expected growth of 9.5-10 percent this year and warned
against upside risks of consumer inflation in the second half.
 A Reuters poll of economists earlier this month produced a
median forecast of 10 percent, but the survey was conducted
before the release of second quarter GDP and June output data
that came at the lower end of forecasts.
 China's growth moderated to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter from 11.9 percent in the first quarter as Beijing
steered monetary and fiscal policy back to normal after a
record credit surge to counter the global crisis.
 Consumer inflation also eased to 2.9 percent in the year to
June, from 3.1 percent in the 12 months to May.
 The slowdown has fuelled market expectations that Beijing
might ease off its tightening of policy or even announce new
stimulus measures.
 However, Yi Xianrong, a prominent researcher with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank
in Beijing, disagreed.
 ""The direction of China's macro economic growth will not
reverse and the government should not introduce new policy to
stimulate the economy,"" he wrote in an article published in the
Financial News, which is run by the central bank.
 ""It's enough to maintain the stability and continuity of
policy introduced in the first half,"" he said.
 China's Commerce Minister, Chen Deming, said the government
would maintain its consumption stimulus in the second half and
take an even longer view in its efforts to promote more
domestic consumption.
 Yi said the tightening campaign in the first half,
including restrictions on multiple home purchases and loans for
new projects, had successfully reined in excessive housing
price rises and the rapid pace of loan growth after a record
lending of 9.6 trillion yuan last year.
 If China is firm in its determination to curb speculation
in the real estate market, the country's economic structure
will improve, laying a more solid foundation for long-term
growth, Yi said.

 * Fall in U.S. bond yields seen hurting greenback
 * Euro/dollar stalls ahead of Europe's stress tests
 * Wariness about Japan verbal intervention hampers yen
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 22 (Reuters) - The dollar slid towards a recent
seven-month low versus the yen on Thursday after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke expressed concern about the U.S. economy
but steered clear of hinting about further easing as some had
hoped.
 The euro, which lost sharply after his comments sparked
outflows from stocks and other risk assets, held steady at lower
levels ahead of Europe's bank stress test results on Friday.
 Bernanke, in testimony prepared for delivery to the Senate
Banking Committee, said the U.S. economy faces ""unusually
uncertain"" prospects.
 Although he said the Fed was ready to take further steps to
bolster growth if needed, analysts said lack of clarity on what
measures it could take prompted investors to reduce risk
positions, benefiting the low-yielding yen across the board.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent in Asian trade to 86.65 yen,
extending losses after a 0.5 percentage point fall on Wednesday,
on a mixture of offers from Japanese exporters and hedging
selling related to some currency-linked structured notes.
 Some market players say the dollar could fall below a
seven-month trough of 86.27 yen hit last week.
 ""Some say there will be a lot of stop-losses below the
current levels. I think the dollar could fall fast if it breaks
below 86 yen,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 Option traders have said the market has short gamma positions
below 85 yen, which means there will likely be more hedge-selling
if the currency falls below that level.
 A relentless drop in U.S. bond yields is also reducing the
allure of the dollar in comparison with the yen.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield fell to a record low
around 0.56 percent, following Bernanke's comments, shrinking the
yield spread of two-year U.S bonds over Japanese government debt
to a fresh 15-month low.
 Others were less convinced about the likelihood of further
falls in the dollar.
 The pair's 14-day relative strength index is at 33, near the
30 mark considered to indicate an oversold market.
 Yuki Sakasai, FX strategist at Barclays Capital, said the
dollar/yen was unlikely to fall below the low for now.
 ""What Bernanke has said is essentially the same as the
minutes (of the Fed's June 22-23 meeting). So his comments alone
are unlikely to push the dollar/yen below recent trading ranges,""
Sakasai said.
 The rise in the yen, which gained steeply on the crosses on
Wednesday, has been hampered by caution that Japanese policy
makers may try to talk it down as it nears a 14-year high around
85 yen per dollar hit last November.
 Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda on Thursday said Japan
wants to avoid excessive rises in the yen but market reaction was
muted.
 The euro ticked up to $1.2768, winning some reprieve after
having lost nearly a full percent in the previous session on
Bernanke's comments as well as tepid demand at a Portuguese debt
sale.
 It has some support at its 14-day moving average around
$1.2742 and around $1.2720, a July 9 high that will now be
support.
 The currency is likely to consolidate around the current
levels, as few traders will be eager to push it higher before the
European Union unveils the stress tests on euro zone banks.
 The euro has had a good run against the dollar in recent
weeks, rising to a 10-week high above $1.30 on Tuesday as traders
began to bet most of the 91 European banks being examined would
pass the tests.
 European policy makers have expressed confidence their banks
would pass, although some analysts say investors remain sceptical
about the severity of the health checks.
 Major listed banks, which face constant investor scrutiny,
are expected to pass, but the tests may show the worst problems
lie with smaller players such as Spanish cajas and German
landesbanks, which are mainly unlisted.

 HONG KONG, July 22 (Reuters) - The yen neared a 7-1/2-month

further,"" said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager of equity

 Japan's Nikkei share average <.N225> finished down 0.6

fallen 1.7 percent so far in July, underperforming the S&P 500

 Short-term indicators pointed to oversold conditions,
though persistent yen strength has dominated equity trading
lately. As long as currency dealers keep knocking the dollar
back toward 85 yen per dollar, roughly the low from November
2009, Japanese equities could be under pressure.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan

Caterpillar  will be among the more closely watched

 YEN GAINS
 The yen rose across the board, benefiting from the
increased risk aversion in financial markets. The U.S. dollar
fell 0.5 percent to 86.48 yen , closing in on the
7-1/2-month low hit last week of 86.27 yen.

 However, traders appeared intent on testing what many
believe to be the line in the sand at 85 yen per dollar, beyond
which they expect Japan would take action to defend.
 The yen has already risen more than 7 percent against the
dollar so far this year.
 MORE BERNANKE
 Long maturity U.S. Treasuries crept higher, pushing down
the 10-year yield to 2.88 percent, not far from the 15-month
low of 2.86 percent hit overnight. The 2-year yield 
was at a record low of 0.56 percent.
 U.S. economic data due later on Thursday are expected to
show persistent weakness in labour and housing markets -- sore
points for investors that exacerbate a shift out of risky
assets. Investors were also awaiting Bernanke's second day of
testimony to Congress (starting at 1330 GMT).
 ""Bernanke is testifying again, and focus will be on whether
he gives any extra hint of potential Fed action if the economy

data releases would further strain investors' nerves,"" Dariusz
Kowalczyk, senior economist with Credit Agricole CIB in Hong

(Adds comments, details in paragraphs 5-8)
 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, July 22 (Reuters) - Japan warned on Thursday against
excessive rises in the yen, as the currency hovers near a
seven-month high against the dollar on worries about the U.S.
economic outlook.
 The dollar hit a seven-month low of 86.27 yen last week,
putting the focus on whether Japanese authorities will increase
their warnings on sharp yen gains.
 The fall took the dollar close to a 14-year low of 84.82 yen
set in November. On Thursday it was around 86.65 yen.
 ""A dollar/yen level of 85 yen is key, but I think few in the
market feel there will be intervention even if the dollar falls
below it,"" said Mitsuru Sahara, chief manager for currency
derivatives trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""Unless the yen rises very rapidly and starts to affect
other financial markets, it's hard for authorities to
intervene.""
 Deputy Finance Minister Motohisa Ikeda, asked about the
yen's recent strengthening, told reporters: ""We have been saying
we want to avoid excessive rises in the yen.""
 The greenback slid towards the recent seven-month low versus
the yen on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
expressed concern about the U.S. economy but steered clear of
hinting about further easing as some had hoped. The dollar was
trading at around 86.60 yen.
 Asked about the impact of a stronger yen on the Japanese
economy, Ikeda said he would not comment on levels but he felt
like French officials do about the weak euro, although he
declined to comment further.
 The deputy finance minister also said he was closely
watching the results of the European bank stress tests, adding
that global economic developments including Japan and the United
States are entering a phase which warrants close watch.
 The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) has
said it will publish results of the tests on the financial
health of 91 European banks at 1600 GMT on Friday.
 Japanese policymakers including Trade Minister Masayuki
Naoshima have expressed alarm over the damage a strong yen could
inflict on the export-reliant economy.
 But market players do not expect Tokyo to intervene to
weaken the yen unless its rises become much more volatile and
are accompanied by sharp falls in share prices.
 Tokyo intervened massively in 2003 and early 2004 to prevent
a rapid rise in the yen from aggravating deflation and derailing
a fragile recovery. But it has not stepped in since then.
 While yen moves alone are unlikely to trigger an immediate
policy response by the BOJ, sharp yen gains accompanied by stock
market falls deep enough to threaten the economy's recovery
could instead lead to further monetary easing.
 BOJ Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi said on Wednesday the
central bank is watching currency moves carefully but shrugged
off any suggestion that rises in the yen to a specific level
would trigger more monetary easing.
 The Ministry of Finance has control over Japan's currency
policy. The BOJ acts as an agent of the MOF when the ministry
decides to intervene in the market.

 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The House of
Representatives approved a bill on Wednesday to help U.S.
manufacturers by suspending import duties on hundreds of raw
materials they use to make finished goods.
 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill, which
passed overwhelmingly even though Republican leaders opposed
it, was a preview of a bigger package Democrats plan to offer
in coming weeks to boost manufacturing jobs.
 ""Democrats know that a strong manufacturing base is key to
our economic revival, and the passage of this bill today is a
good step forward as we continue to create the jobs America
needs,"" Hoyer said.
 The House voted 378 to 43 to approve the U.S. Manufacturing
Enhancement Act, a measure previously known as the
Miscellaneous Tariff Bill and passed every few years.
 Republicans voted 129 to 42 in favor of the bill, even
though their leaders said it violated the party's self-imposed
moratorium on congressional ""earmarks"" that many blame for what
they call wasteful spending and the record U.S. debt.
 The Senate also must approve the bill before it can go to
President Barack Obama for his signature.

enacted, would increase U.S. production by $4.6 billion and
support almost 90,000 jobs.
 ""Manufacturers of all sizes use these vital tariff
suspensions to obtain raw materials, proprietary inputs and
other products that are not available in our nation,"" the
group's president John Engler said.
 ""Without them, the costs of these companies' products will
inevitably increase, forcing them to pass on these costs to
consumers. This hinders competitiveness and translates into
lost jobs,"" he said.
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated lost revenue
from the tariff suspensions at $297.8 million through 2012.
That is paid for through custom user fees.
 House Ways and Means Committee Chair Sander Levin, a
Democrat from Michigan, which has lost many manufacturing jobs,
called the vote ""a defeat for the House Republican leadership
which attempted to put partisan politics and short-term
political gain above the needs of American businesses and
workers.""
 Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who opposed
the bill, said the vote proved Democrats ""can produce strong,
unified support for trade legislation.""
 ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to move
forward with pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama,
and South Korea,"" Brady said, referring to trade deals blocked
for years by congressional Democrats.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Global stocks slid on
Wednesday as investors poured money into safe havens such as
bonds after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the
U.S. economy faces ""unusually uncertain"" prospects, adding to
worries about the recovery.
 Bernanke's downbeat economic assessment slammed U.S.
stocks even after Morgan Stanley  and Apple Inc 
easily beat Wall Street's expectations. The Wall Street bank
and the tech bellwether, known for its iPhone and iPad, were
the latest U.S. corporations to turn in solid results in the
second-quarter reporting season.
 Stocks sold off after Bernanke acknowledged the U.S. labor
market's continued weakness during the first day of his
semiannual testimony to members of Congress. Economic
conditions will warrant exceptionally low interest rates for
an ""extended period,"" Bernanke said. For details:
[ID:nN21165172].
 The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched a near
15-month low and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond posted
its biggest one-day drop in 6-1/2 weeks as investors scooped
up government debt, driving a furious rally. Bond yields move
inversely to price.
 The scramble for long-dated bonds resulted in a brief
narrowing in the gap  between two-year and 10-year
yields to 230 basis points, the tightest since late September
2009.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
pared gains to trade almost 0.3 percent lower after European
shares closed more than 1 percent higher.
 Wall Street ended more than 1 percent lower.
 ""We are now giving up on the notion of a standard recovery
in the U.S. economy,"" said Joe Battipaglia, market strategist
at Stifel Nicolaus in Yardley, Pennsylvania.
 ""The market sold off because unfortunately there is no
remedy provided in Bernanke's commentary to the rising threat
of deflation, the excess capacity in the economy and the
malfunctioning of the credit system,"" Battipaglia said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 109.43
points, or 1.07 percent, at 10,120.53. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> fell 13.89 points, or 1.28 percent, at
1,069.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slid 35.16
points, or 1.58 percent, to 2,187.33.
 Asian stocks had advanced on Apple's strong earnings and
on hopes that China may roll back policy tightening measures
later this year. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan
stocks <.MIAPJ0000PUS> gained 0.7 percent, Japan's Nikkei
average <.N225> inched down 0.2 percent.
 DESPAIR IN THE AFTERNOON
 Investors have been reluctant to make big commitments in
equities due to growing worry about the economy, sparked by a
recent slew of disappointing economic data.
 To be sure, the benchmark S&P 500 found support on
Wednesday at its 14-day moving average and held above 1,060, a
level seen as critical by some technical analysts.
 The euro fell sharply against the dollar while the yen
rallied after Bernanke testified. [ID:nN21172670]
 ""The market was looking for some form of concrete action
from Bernanke, a commitment to do something. All we got was
that they're aware of the risks and are prepared to take as
yet unspecified actions,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""Reaction is basically turning into a spasm of despair,""
Dolan added.
 The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.68 percent at 83.306.
 The euro  was down 0.90 percent at $1.2768. Against
the yen, the dollar  was down 0.55 percent at 87.02.
 Bernanke's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee
jolted the bond market from its earlier slumber.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 21/32 in price to yield 2.88 percent.
 OIL SLIDES, COPPER CLIMBS
 Oil prices fell from a 3 1/2-week high after data showed
U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose last week, but a
tropical weather system approaching the Gulf limited losses.
 Commercial U.S. crude inventories rose 360,000 barrels in
the week to July 16 to 353.46 million barrels, against a
forecast stocks would be down 1.4 million barrels, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration reported.
 U.S. crude oil for September delivery fell $1.02, or 1.31
percent, to settle at $76.56 a barrel.
 Despite Bernanke's gloomy outlook, copper rallied to its
highest level in more than three weeks as strong physical and
Chinese buying, and another hefty drawdown in inventories,
pointed to a tighter supply/demand balance. [ID:nLDE66K0W4]
 Copper prices have risen about 5 percent in July -- the
first rebound in four months -- helped by better demand from
top industrial metals buyer China, falling stockpiles, a
firmer euro versus the dollar and stronger equity markets.

 OTTAWA, July 21 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar ended lower
against the U.S. currency on Wednesday as equity markets and
oil prices extended their declines after the U.S. Federal
Reserve said the U.S. economy faces ""unusually uncertain""
prospects.
 Canadian bond prices added to their earlier gains, helped
by the sharp declines in equity markets, as the U.S. central
bank's economic outlook suggested interest interest rates would
stay low for some time.
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in prepared testimony to the
U.S. Senate Banking Committee, also said that the bank was
ready to take further steps to bolster growth if needed.
[ID:nWALLIE6DU]
 His remarks were largely in line with the minutes of a
recent bank policy meeting, but today's comments served to
underscore market worries about the global economic outlook and
further soured investor sentiment towards riskier assets.
 The Canadian dollar traced declines on North American
equity markets, which skidded 1 percent, as well as the
softening price of oil.
 The currency  closed at C$1.0477 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.45 U.S. cents, not far off its session low, and
down from Tuesday's finish at C$1.0448 to the U.S. dollar, or
95.71 U.S. cents.
 ""All he really did was repeat just what the data was
telling us and, really, what the last Federal Reserve minutes
were,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia
Capital. ""(But) the most recent equity weakness did cause the
(currency's) biggest weakening spurt of the day.""
 The currency slumped as low as C$1.0503 to the U.S. dollar,
or 95.21 U.S. cents, following Bernanke's remarks, a long and
steep reversal from its best level overnight when it had jumped
almost a penny to close to a one-week high at C$1.0351 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.61 U.S. cents.
 ""The Canadian dollar continues to trade with some
volatility but really in a very well-defined sideways range
between C$1.03 and C$1.07. We're more or less in the middle of
it,"" said Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange at
National Bank Financial.
 A weak tone to Canadian wholesale activity also weighed, as
data released Wednesday morning showed wholesale trade
unexpectedly slipped 0.1 percent in May from April.
[ID:nN2136413]
 Looking ahead, markets will be looking at Canadian retail
sales data for May on Thursday, as well as several reports on
U.S. housing. 
 Also on Thursday, the Bank of Canada should provide more
details on its view of the economy in its Monetary Policy
Report, which will be followed by a press conference by
Governor Mark Carney.
 ""We've already seen some telegraphing of what the bank
thinks,"" said Spitz. ""Ultimately, it will be more or less
dovetailing with Carney's comments that the domestic landscape
is likely not to go unscathed with respect to the the global
backdrop ... which is one of uncertainty.""
 BONDS GAIN
 The two-year bond  rose 17 Canadian cents to
yield 1.515 percent, while the 10-year bond  gained
33 Canadian cents to yield 3.157 percent.
 Canadian bonds were mixed against U.S. Treasury issues,
with short-dated issues outperforming and long-dated debt
underperforming. The Canadian 10-year bond was 28.1 basis
points above the comparable U.S. bond, compared with 23.9 basis
points in the previous session.
