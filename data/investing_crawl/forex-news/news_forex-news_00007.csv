The yen/dollar pairing was down 0.17% to 114.50. 
The pound/dollar pair increased 0.21% to 1.2181. The price of gold was also down on the day's strong retail sales data, settling at 1197.80, a decline of 0.17%. 
Analysts noted the dollar gained against the yen, but was little changed against the euro on Friday. The greenback is rebounding from five-week lows. Retail sales data fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve Bank would indeed raise interest rates three times this year, as previously announced.
The U.S. Commerce Department today reported that retail sales increased 0.6% in December, while November's retail sales were revised upward to reveal a 0.2% rise instead of the previously reported 0.1% gain.
President-elect Trump takes office a week from today. Only CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis are expected to be confirmed by the Senate before the president takes the oath of office on Friday afternoon.

Rubio lost the GOP nomination for president to Trump last year, failing even in his home state of Florida. "

(Reuters) - The United States Mint has unveiled a $100 gold coin featuring an African-American woman as the face of Lady Liberty for the first time in the history of U.S. currency.
The 24-karat gold coin, which marks the Mint's 225th anniversary, was debuted on Thursday in the Department of the Treasury's Cash Room in Washington, D.C.
It is the first in a series of gold coins featuring Lady Liberty, which has been used on American coinage since the late 1790s, as an ethnic woman, Mint Principal Deputy Director Rhett Jeppson said in a statement. 
Other editions will use designs representing Asian, Hispanic Americans and others ""to reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the United States,"" Jeppson said.
""We boldly look to the future by casting Liberty in a new light... looking forward to ever brighter chapters in our nation's history book,"" Jeppson said.
The coin's heads-side design by artist Justin Kunz depicts the profile of Liberty wearing a crown of stars with the inscriptions ""Liberty,"" ""1792,"" ""2017"" and ""In God we trust.""
Depicted on the reverse side, which was designed by Chris Costello, is an image of an eagle in flight. The inscription on the tails side include the nation's motto, ""E pluribus unum,"" which translates to English from Latin as ""Out of many, one."" 
Phebe Hemphill and Michael Gaudioso, both based at the Mint's Philadelphia facility, sculpted the coin.

The Mint, which is the nation's only manufacturer of official coinage, is set to release the initial coin design on April 6. It will be issued biennially.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2017 08:00AM ET</span>","Dollar limps to worst week in two months, sterling stays shaky","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar limped toward it worst week in two months on Friday as softer-than-expected trade data from China added to signs that investors may be falling out of love with the post-U.S. election Trump trade.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures it against six of the other top world currencies, was down fractionally for a third straight day in early London trading and almost one percent lower on the week.
Individually it stood at 114.7 yen  having given up modest ground made in Asia, while the euro  clawed up to $1.0630 to bolster a fourth straight week of gains.
Nomura's Jordan Rochester said the greenback was still hobbled by disappointment that President-elect Trump hadn't touched on fiscal stimulus at a news conference on Wednesday and instead talked about divisive plans such as building a wall on the border with Mexico.
""It opens up the possibility for the market that he could go down the more toxic route which is becoming more protective on trade,"" Rochester said.
""Therefore it's quite prudent for investors that the dollar is a bit softer, especially against the yen which is the proxy here.""
Some analysts however think the dollar could regain an upper hand as soon as more details of Trump's stimulus become clear.
More Federal Reserve members talked on Thursday about rate hikes and trimming the size of the central bank's balance sheet and U.S. retail sales data are due to be released later that could give the dollar a jolt.
A Reuters poll shows that economists expect a 0.7 percent pickup in retail sales in December, following 0.1 percent growth in November. 
""Medium term we should still see a stronger dollar,"" said James Binny, head of currency with State Street Global Advisors in London. ""The positions were just so one-way and we needed a bit of a clearout to make some further progress."" 
The week's other main G10 loser, sterling, remained shaky on Friday as it was confirmed that Prime Minister Theresa May would give a speech on Tuesday on Britain's plan to leave the European Union.
One-week implied sterling volatility - options contracts which allow traders to bet or hedge against near-term swings in the currency, spiked to their highest since October at 14.775 .
It was also set to be the pound's worst week against the euro since the start of October. It barely budged at 87.25 pence per euro (EURGBP=D4) on Friday but was down almost 2 percent from where it started the week. 
Against the dollar it was a touch higher on the day at $1.2180  but on course for its fifth weekly drop in the last six, having hit a three-month low of $1.2038 on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit its lowest level in five weeks against a basket of currencies on Thursday and was on course for its worst week since November, hit by a loss of confidence in the U.S. reflation trade a day after a news conference by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
Speculators had driven the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, to a one-week high Wednesday in anticipation that Trump's first news conference since his Nov. 8 victory would give more detail on new fiscal spending and tax measures to repatriate U.S. corporate capital held overseas.
Instead, the event was dominated by debate over Russian hacking and unsubstantiated claims that he had been caught in a compromising position in Moscow. The dollar index tumbled as much as 0.9 percent to 100.720, its weakest since Dec. 8, after touching 102.950 before the news conference Wednesday.
The index pared losses in afternoon trading and was last down just 0.4 percent at 101.370.
""Yesterday’s press conference failed to disclose any information on tax reform, on fiscal stimulus, whether that’s going to come or not,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho in New York. ""We’re seeing a little bit of that disappointment.""
The dollar index had gained 4 percent between Trump's election victory and Wednesday on expectations that his promised policies would boost inflation and encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The index is on track to fall 0.9 percent this week to mark its worst week since that ended Nov. 4.
The dollar weakened as much as 1.4 percent against the yen to 113.76 yen <JPY=>, its weakest level in five weeks, while the euro hit its highest in five weeks against the dollar of $1.0684 <EUR=>.

The dollar was last down 0.3 percent against the peso at 21.7870 pesos. The peso broke the 22 peso-per-dollar mark for the first time on Wednesday  after Trump said U.S. auto companies would face a high tax for products made south of the border.
Analysts said it was unclear how long the dollar weakness would last. 

""For the moment, I would stop short of drawing broader conclusions. I think (Trump) will still implement his policy platform,"" said Lee Hardman, a currency economist with Japan's MUFG in London.

USD/TRY was trading at 3.7845, down 2.07% from Wednesday’s close. The pair hit highs of 3.9423 on Wednesday and ended the day with gains of around 2.0%.
It was the largest one-day decline in the lira since a failed coup in July that attempted to overthrow the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Emerging markets have been hard hit since Donald Trump’s surprise U.S. presidential election victory in November, as the prospects of rising U.S. interest rates prompted investors to pull cash out of developing economies.
Turkey has become particularly fragile because of high levels of political and economic risk and relatively low central bank reserves to defend its currency.
A string of terror attacks in Turkey, uncertainty over the outlook for economic growth and worries about political instability have all pressured the lira lower.
The lira has already fallen around 7% against the dollar so far this year in spite of efforts by the country’s central bank to shore up the currency on Tuesday.
Turkey's central bank loosened foreign-currency reserve requirements by a half percentage point, in a move aimed at allowing banks to release foreign currency into the market to prop up the lira.
Data on Wednesday showed that Turkey's current-account deficit widened in November, adding to pressure on an economy already suffering from a drop in its currency.
A current account deficit means Turkey is reliant on foreign sources of financing to fund the shortfall.
Ratings agencies Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s both downgraded the country’s credit rating to junk status in 2016.
Moody's said Monday that bank profits will be hit by an increase in bad loans this year and warned of a ""general worsening"" in the investment climate in Turkey.
On Thursday, President Erdogan blamed a conspiracy for the recent plunge of the lira, saying those who used the exchange rate as a weapon were no different from terrorists.
Erdogan did not say who was to blame for the purported conspiracy.
Meanwhile, the U.S dollar fell to one month lows against a currency basket on Thursday after Donald Trump failed to address economic and fiscal policies in his first formal news conference as U.S. president-elect.
Trump disappointed investors who had been hoping he would outline his proposed plans to boost the U.S. economy with infrastructure spending and tax reforms.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, hit lows of 101.00, the weakest level since December 14 and was last at 101.91, off 0.77% for the day."

The firm's head of Asian portfolios, Luke Spajic, said in a note Beijing was finding it impossible achieve three goals simultaneously: a stable or fixed foreign exchange rate, free capital movement and an independent monetary policy. 
Combining tighter financial conditions with this policy trilemma therefore means the yuan would probably remain an ""escape valve"".
""Over the year, our base case is for the yuan to decline against the U.S. dollar by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage,"" Spajic said.

""However, we also think the possibility that the PBOC will allow the yuan to float freely, or at least widen its trading band, has increased.""

Speaking at a news conference in New York, Trump also reiterated that the United States would start building a southern border wall after he took office next week. He said Mexico would reimburse the cost either through a tax or a payment.

SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - China's central bank launched spot checks on leading bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai, ratcheting up pressure on potential capital outflows and knocking the price of the cryptocurrency down more than 12 percent against the dollar.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said its probe of bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin was to look into a range of possible rule violations, including market manipulation, money laundering and unauthorized financing. It did not say if any violations had been found.
Chinese authorities have stepped up efforts to stem capital outflows and relieve pressure on the yuan.
While the yuan lost more than 6.5 percent against the dollar last year, its worst performance since 1994, the bitcoin price has soared to near-record highs. 
That, and the relative anonymity the digital currency affords, has prompted some to believe bitcoin has become an attractive option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and skirt around rules limiting how much foreign exchange individuals can buy each year.
The PBOC in Beijing, where officers visited the offices of OKCoin and Huobi on Wednesday, said in a statement that ""spot checks were focused on how the exchanges implement policies including forex management and anti-money laundering"".
Separately in Shanghai, the PBOC said it visited BTCC, noting its checks ""focused on whether the firm was operating out of its business scope, whether it was launching unauthorized financing, payment, forex business or other related businesses, whether it was involved in market manipulation, anti-money laundering or (carried) fund security risks.""
On the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, the price of bitcoin  fell as much as 12.5 percent to a 3-week low of $800. 
On China's Huobi exchange, the price slid more than 16 percent to 5,313 yuan , equivalent to around $766, putting the yuan/bitcoin rate at a discount to the rate on dollar-based exchanges. 
Normally, bitcoin trades at a premium in China, with a lack of trading fees encouraging volumes and boosting demand.
""Selling is being driven by China. The fear is that ... this investigation could lead to, worse-case scenario, funds being withheld from them (Chinese investors) or one of the exchanges being found to have acted improperly,"" said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare.
""This is a ratcheting up of the rhetoric from the Chinese authorities - instead of 'we're watching' you, it's now 'we're investigating' you,"" he said.
According to his analysis, Hayter says trading between the yuan and bitcoin accounted for around 98 percent of the total market in the past six months.
""The long term implications of this are positive as more rigor in the Chinese market only matures and brings respectability to the industry - but in the short term this could effect volumes which have been one of the key drivers of the recent rally,"" Hayter added.
""FRUITFUL MEETING""
Bobby Lee, CEO of Shanghai-based BTCC, confirmed the PBOC visit, but said he believed the company was not out of line.
""We're definitely vigilant. We think we are in compliance with all the current rules and regulations of running a bitcoin exchange in China,"" he told Reuters by phone.
""I wouldn't call it an investigation. I think they are working closely with us to learn more about our business model and the bitcoin exchange industry. We had a very fruitful meeting today,"" Lee said.
A Huobi executive, who declined to be named, confirmed the PBOC visited its office on Wednesday, but declined to provide details. A spokeswoman for OKCoin told Reuters its platform was operating normally, and the exchange was working with the authorities.

Last week, PBOC officials met with the three exchanges, and the central bank publicly urged investors to take a rational and cautious approach to investing in bitcoin.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish lira fell to new lows on Wednesday despite efforts by the central bank to support it by boosting dollar supply, making it the worst performing major currency this year with losses of more than 9 percent against the dollar.
The lira slumped as much as 2.5 percent against the dollar in early trade on Wednesday as concern about Turkey's political and economic stability was compounded by doubts about whether the central bank would take strong enough action.
The bank's reluctance to hike interest rates to stem the lira's falls has exacerbated worries triggered by militant bombings, an economic slowdown and political uncertainty over plans to bolster President Tayyip Erdogan's powers.
The lira , which has lost around a quarter of its value against the dollar since an attempted coup in July, hit a record low of 3.8950 before firming to 3.8540 by 0613 GMT.
On Tuesday, the central bank reduced forex reserve requirement ratios by 50 basis points in a move it said would add some $1.5 billion liquidity to the system.
It said developments in markets were being monitored closely and additional steps may be taken in order to maintain price and financial stability if deemed necessary.
Its move brought only a temporary pause in the lira's slide.

At its last rate-setting meeting in December, the central bank defied expectations of a hike and left rates on hold. It will meet again to set rates on Jan. 24.
The lira also hit a record low of 4.1089 against the euro (EURTRY=), weakening from a close on Tuesday of 3.9971, before firming slightly to 4.0454.

The Office for National Statistics said industrial output rose 2.1% in November, recovering from October’s 1.1% drop.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar inched higher against the yen on Wednesday but was steady against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength as investors awaited U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's first formal news conference. 
The dollar has gained broadly since Trump's victory in November as investors bet he would boost public spending and spur repatriation of overseas funds by U.S. companies, policies expected to bring higher inflation and interest rates. 
But more doubts have emerged in recent weeks about that narrative, and investors will have a close eye on what the new president says about trade and relations with China.
""The dollar is still holding up quite well and there is a presumption that we are going to get support from tighter monetary policy and looser fiscal policy,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC in London.
""Overall we're still constructive but it does look more a case of playing the end of the rally before we see a correction later this year.""
The dollar index was roughly steady at 102.04, in the middle of a range it has held for the past week and off a 14-year peak of 103.82 hit on Jan. 3 . (DXY) Against the yen, it rose 0.1 percent to 115.92 yen, nearly 3 percent off almost one-year highs hit in December. 
The euro was steady at $1.0556  after brushing a 10-day high of $1.0628 overnight.
Trump's news conference is due to start at around 11:00 EST (1600 GMT).
""The less market positioning friendly policies (are) a strong focus on trade tariffs or perhaps more importantly if he talks about a weaker dollar policy,"" Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester wrote in a note for clients. 
""We wouldn’t be surprised to see 113.50 to 114 yen over coming weeks if he moves in this policy direction so soon. If he directly comments on a weaker dollar policy, the adjustment could be more (like) 110 to 112 in coming weeks.""
Expectations that the Trump administration would enact economic stimulus measures backed by massive fiscal spending have taken Wall Street to record highs and U.S. debt yields to levels unseen since 2014.
Against that backdrop, financial markets are keen to see how Trump will follow through on campaign pledges.

""The dollar is set to resume the Trump rally if he provides specifics of stimulus measures, notably those related to tax cuts, which appear achievable,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.

43,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2017 03:00PM ET</span>","Euro may not exist in 10 years, France's Macron says","By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - The euro may not exist in 10 years' time if Paris and Berlin fail to bolster the single currency union, French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday, adding the current system benefited Germany at the expense of weaker member states.
Macron was economy minister under Socialist President Francois Hollande until he resigned this year to create his own political movement and stand as an independent candidate in this year's presidential election.
""The truth is that we must collectively recognize that the euro is incomplete and cannot last without major reforms,"" Macron said in a speech at the Humboldt University in Berlin.
Speaking in English, he added: ""It has not provided Europe with full international sovereignty against the dollar on its rules. It has not provided Europe with a natural convergence between the different member states.""
France must implement labor market reforms and revamp its education system to revive growth, while Germany must accept that more investment instead of austerity can boost growth across the euro zone area, the centrist politician said.
""The dysfunctioning of the euro is of good use to Germany, I have to say,"" said Macron, adding that a lack of trust between France and Germany was blocking major reforms that would increase solidarity among the 19 members of the euro zone.
""The euro is a weak Deutsche Mark,"" said Macron. ""The status quo is synonymous, in 10 years' time, with the dismantling of the euro.""
He proposed the creation of a euro zone budget to finance growth-oriented investments and to extend financial assistance to struggling member states.
GERMAN RESISTANCE
However, this would be anathema to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, whose conservatives face an election this year and have faced domestic resistance to bailouts for Greece by hawks who say such payments turn the euro zone into a ""transfer union"".
Macron spoke after the co-leader of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party earlier told Reuters the euro zone should be split into two with a strong cluster around Germany and a weak cluster including France.
Macron, a rare advocate in France of deeper European integration, has taken the unusual step of encouraging supporters to cheer the European Union at political rallies in contrast with other politicians who often rail against ""Brussels"".
Macron, 39, has enjoyed a boost in recent polls, which show him cementing his position as the presidential election’s ""third man"" and within a whisker of reaching the crucial second round runoff to be held in May.

An opinion poll last week showed conservative candidate Francois Fillon's lead in France's presidential election race had narrowed, with both Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen gaining on the former prime minister.

The peso was the worst-performing major currency last year, weakening 20 percent against the dollar as Donald Trump closed in on the U.S. presidency.
The depreciation has picked up pace in the first days of 2017 after President-elect Trump told major automakers to expect high taxes on vehicles made in Mexico. The peso has fallen more than 4 percent against the dollar since Jan. 1.

Gurria said Mexico's central bank, which sold $2 billion in dollar reserves last week to support the peso, had helped prevent a deeper crash, but warned it could not burn through too many greenbacks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department was set to bring charges on Tuesday against three ex-traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) arising from a probe into the manipulation of foreign-exchange prices at major banks, a person familiar with the matter said.
Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Chris Ashton, formerly of Barclays, are expected to face criminal charges in a case filed in federal court in New York, the person said.
The expected charges were first reported by Bloomberg News. Lawyers for Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton could not be immediately identified.
The case comes after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency prices, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines.
Prosecutors have said that from 2007 to 2013, euro-dollar traders at the banks belonging to an electronic chat group called ""The Cartel"" manipulated benchmark exchange rates in an effort to increase their profits.
Last week, a former trader at Barclays and  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP), Jason Katz, pleaded guilty to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy, becoming the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the probe.
He was the third person to date to face U.S. criminal charges in connection with the foreign-exchange probe.
In July, an  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) executive, Mark Johnson, was arrested and charged along with a former executive for participating in a fraudulent scheme involving a $3.5 billion currency transaction. Johnson has pleaded not guilty.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recovered from earlier losses on Tuesday, on the view the market had over-reacted to worries about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's first news conference. 
The dollar had fallen as much as 1 percent against a basket of currencies (DXY) since the start of the week. Investors had fretted that Trump - who takes office on Jan. 20 - could shake markets at Wednesday's press conference by taking an aggressive line on issues such as trade policy and relations with China. 
But the dollar had steadied by 1230 GMT, with the index trading flat at 101.89. The euro, which had earlier hit an 11-day high above $1.06, was also flat at $1.0580. 
Nordea currency strategist Niels Christensen, in Copenhagen, noted that Trump had taken a relatively conciliatory tone in his victory speech, and would be more likely to make the kinds of radical, off-the-cuff comments that investors fear via other channels, such as social media. 
""Trump can make remarks more or less all the time, but I think when it is an official press conference, he will have been briefed and he might not be as inclined to go off and make some radical statement,"" Christensen said. 
""So the market had got a bit ahead of itself about the press conference tomorrow."" 
The dollar index has climbed 4 percent since Trump's election on Nov. 8, as investors bet his promised program of fiscal expansion will boost inflation and growth, leading to a faster pace of interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve. 
Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren on Monday called on the U.S. central bank to step up the pace of its rate increases from the once-a-year pattern it has pursued since 2015, warning of inflation risks if it does not. 
At a separate event, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said it was too early to judge how the incoming Trump administration may change the path of the economy. 
""The Fed has stressed this enormous uncertainty (around Trump), so ... the main driver right now (for the dollar) is not monetary policy, because monetary policy will react to what we’re going to hear from Donald Trump in the next couple of weeks,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt, in Frankfurt. 

Disquiet over whether Britain will undergo a ""hard"" exit from the European Union - in which immigration controls get priority over access to the single market - kept pressure on sterling, which hit a 10-week trough.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2017 11:30AM ET</span>",Big China bitcoin exchange says no government pressure on outflows,"By John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The head of a major bitcoin exchange in China says few people there use the cryptocurrency to get around rules on how much money they can take out of the country, and despite a publicized meeting with the central bank last week the exchange, BTCC, hasn't been told explicitly to check capital outflows.
Bitcoin's price took a steep dive on Friday after China's central bank cautioned investors to take a rational and careful approach to investing in the digital currency. The price had surged to record highs.
The central bank's comments come as Beijing escalates a campaign to check capital outflows and slow the depreciation of the yuan currency , which lost nearly 7 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar last year.
With bitcoin's soaring price and the relative anonymity it affords, some believe the digital currency was becoming an attractive option for tech-savvy Chinese to hedge against the yuan and circumvent rules that limit individuals to $50,000 of foreign exchange each year.
The Shanghai office of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on Friday it had met with BTCC to understand the platform's operations, highlight the risks, remind the exchange to abide by the law, and ""urge the platform to carry out self-examination and corresponding clean-up and rectification"" according to law.
Asked if BTCC had received direct pressure on outflows, CEO Bobby Lee, who founded BTCC in 2011, said: ""No. Not as of yet... Nothing verbal or written to us.""
In Beijing, the PBOC told two of China's other big bitcoin exchanges, Huobi and OKCoin, not to mention the depreciating yuan when advertising their platforms, the influential news outlet Caixin said, citing people familiar with the meeting.
Star Xu, CEO and founder of OKCoin, confirmed there had been a meeting of the PBOC and leading bitcoin exchanges on Friday to discuss the operation of trading platforms.
""The industry can benefit from balanced, risk-based regulation and/or oversight, and we look forward to further constructive discussions with the regulators and industry participants,"" Xu told Reuters in an emailed comment.
Huobi's chief operating officer Zhu Jiawei said in an emailed response to Reuters queries that Huobi plans to work with other bitcoin firms to establish an alliance and rules to self-govern the industry.
While it's possible to buy bitcoin with yuan and then sell it abroad for a foreign currency, BTCC's Lee said ""to be honest, not many"" people were doing it because of the cost.
The renminbi price of bitcoin carries a premium to the price in other currencies, he noted. In addition, buy or sell orders in the 100,000 yuan ($14,423) to 1 million yuan ($144,233) range, and up, would influence the bitcoin spot price and affect the transaction.
""For that range, you're not going to be able to do it at a good rate. You're going to lose 10 percent of your money,"" Lee said. ""Maybe the individual household might buy 20,000 more dollars worth of bitcoin than their $50,000 (forex) quota, but that's a drop in the bucket.""
Still, Lee said various indicators, like active trading accounts, new users, actual deposits and withdrawals, were ""very active"" in China, and some key BTCC metrics were at ""all-time highs"", though he declined to be more specific.
NOT LEGAL TENDER
Bitcoin is not regulated in China, but the PBOC has declared it is not legal tender, and is instead a ""virtual good"", Lee said. That puts it in the same category as other goods.
""If I pack a suitcase and take a plane to the United States, do the clothes, does the computer in my suitcase, does the watch I wear count towards capital flight?"" he said. ""Where do you draw the line?""
He said no new or planned rules regarding bitcoin were discussed in the latest meeting with the PBOC, and he estimates it will be two to three years before China regulates bitcoin.
In a statement on its website, BTCC, which calls itself the world's longest running bitcoin exchange, said it regularly meets with the PBOC and ""work(s) closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China.""
Exchanges in China say they account for more than 90 percent of global bitcoin trading, which would help explain why a shift in Chinese demand would sharply affect the price.

But many bitcoin experts say Chinese exchanges overstate their volumes in the digital currency, and attribute sharp moves to speculation by, for example, U.S.-based hedge funds.

LONDON (Reuters) - Talk of Britain drastically reworking trade ties with the European Union after Brexit sent the pound tumbling to two-month lows on Monday, as signals that U.S. interest rates could rise three times this year lifted the dollar.
The pound slid over 1 percent against both the dollar GBP=D4 and the euro EURGBP=R after weekend comments from British Prime Minister Theresa May that she was not interested in keeping ""bits of membership"" of the European Union. 
May said she instead wanted a bespoke deal and also denied criticism that she was ""muddled"" in the pursuit of what she called the right relationship with the EU, the country's largest trading partner.
Sterling slid as low as $1.2125, its weakest against the dollar since the end of October. It fell 1.1 percent against the euro too, hitting 86.65 pence per euro, the lowest since mid-November.
""We think it was the prime minister prioritizing immigration over a trade deal that pulled the run from under sterling,"" said National Australia Bank's head of markets strategy, Nick Parsons.
""The optimism in late November, early December had been based on an apparent desire to secure a trade deal and yesterday was a marked shift (from) that,"" he added, saying the next threshold to watch for the pound was $1.2083.
The dollar crept ahead after signs of wage pressure in the December U.S. jobs report on Friday proved enough to lift 10-year Treasury yields from 2.33 percent to 2.42 percent after a sizable fall earlier in the week.
Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans, who is a voting Fed member this year, also lent support, saying U.S interest rates could go up three times this year, faster than he expected a few months ago.

TRUMP FACTOR
The euro initially held up after Germany reported the steepest monthly rise in exports in four-and-half years, but the resistance faded and it sagged a few cents to $1.0518 having ricocheted between $1.0339 and $1.0621 last week.
""If we have seen the low in U.S. Treasury yields then potentially the dollar could come back quite strongly,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy.
""It all depends on Trump and how aggressive he is in his first days in office.""
The president-elect is due to be sworn in on Jan. 20 but this week there will be Senate confirmation hearings for a number of his top administration nominees, including secretary of state and attorney general, that should provide a test of his ability to work with fellow Republicans in Congress.
Two non-voting Fed presidents will speak later on Monday, and five speeches are lined up for Thursday. The main economic release of the week is not until Friday, when retail sales figures for December are out. 
Dealers in Asia will be keeping an eye on the yuan CNY= after Beijing engineered a sharp tightening in liquidity last week that squeezed speculators out of short yuan/long dollar positions.
China's central bank kept up the pressure on Monday, setting a firmer fix for the yuan than many had expected at 6.9262 per dollar, even though that was down from the previous fix.
Yet the defence is proving costly.

Figures out over the weekend showed China's foreign exchange reserves fell to nearly six-year lows in December as Beijing fought to stem an outflow of capital that could ultimately force another devaluation of the currency.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 11:19AM ET</span>",Battered bitcoin slides another 12 percent after China warning,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin plunged by as much as 12 percent on Friday after China's central bank urged investors to take a rational and cautious approach to investing in the digital currency, which is on track for its heaviest two-day drop in two years. 
Bitcoin had been on a tear until Wednesday, gaining more than 40 percent in two weeks to hit around $1,139 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, just shy of its all-time record of $1,163.
But the web-based digital currency, which has shown an intriguing inverse correlation to the Chinese yuan in recent months, plunged as the yuan soared on Thursday, falling as much as 20 percent at one point.
It continued that fall on Friday, with its losses accelerating after the central bank's warning.
It fell as low as $871, down almost a quarter from its peak on Wednesday, before recovering to about $900 by 1455 GMT (9:55 a.m. ET). That still left it down 10 percent on the day and on track for its worst two-day performance since January 2015.
The Shanghai head office of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) noted in a statement that bitcoin prices had shown abnormal fluctuations in recent days, and said those investing in it should do so carefully, with awareness of the currency's volatility.
The PBOC's words carried echoes of its 2013 warning that financial institutions should steer clear of the digital currency, which sparked a $300 slide in bitcoin. 
The PBOC also repeated on Friday its 2013 view that bitcoin is not a currency and could therefore not be circulated as a real currency in the market. 
For full statement click: http://beijing.pbc.gov.cn/beijing/132005/3230072/index.ht 
""This is the Chinese authorities saying: we're watching,"" said Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency data analysis website Cryptocompare. ""The relative size of the bitcoin market is minor, but trading has reached up to $10 billion a day on the bitcoin-yuan pairs.""
""The full meaning of the government's comments aren't 100 percent clear, but restrictions and regulation of trading is one avenue that could affect volumes and therefore price."" 
Hayter said trading between the yuan and bitcoin had made up about 98 percent of the market for the past six months, according to his analysis. Because there are no trading fees on Chinese exchanges, it is much easier to get in and out of trades and therefore creates a higher trading volume, he said.
Bitcoin can be used for moving money across the globe quickly and anonymously, and operates outside the control of any central authority. 
That makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as in China, and also to investors who are worried about a devaluation in their currency - one of the reasons often cited for bitcoin's surge in 2016. While the yuan fell 7 percent, its worst year since 1994, bitcoin outperformed all other currencies, with a 125 percent climb. 
But many bitcoin experts say Chinese trading volumes are overstated and attribute sharp moves to speculation by, for example, U.S.-based hedge funds.
""VOLATILE MARKETS"" 
The volatile trading prompted officials from the PBOC's Shanghai branch on Friday to meet representatives of a major bitcoin trading platform in China, BTCC.
""On January 6 the People's Bank of China Business Management Department and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Financial Affairs jointly met with the relevant regulatory authorities of the 'currency network',"" the PBOC said in the statement.
BTCC said in a post on Twitter: ""BTCC regularly meets with (the) PBOC and we work closely with them to ensure we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China."" 
""All of our users should be aware of the current policies on virtual goods as well as the risks involved in trading in volatile markets,"" another Tweet read. 
Eric Gu, a blockchain expert and founder of ViewFin, a Chinese blockchain start-up, said the PBOC meets the country's major bitcoin exchanges regularly but had previously never made such meetings public.
But recent volatility has increased risks and has triggered fears that the market could be used as a channel for money laundering, he said. 
""Previously, bitcoin trading volume was small, and money laundering was not possible in such a market,"" said Gu. ""Now, the volume is up ... everyday, there are tens of billions of yuan worth of bitcoin changing hands. Volume is still (comparatively)small, but big enough to make the central bank worry.""

69,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 10:55AM ET</span>",Dollar up as solid U.S. jobs report sets stage for Fed hikes,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday, boosted by a solid U.S. jobs report, but was headed for a second straight weekly loss after tumbling the day before on mixed U.S. economic data and apparent action by Chinese authorities to shore up the yuan.
The dollar gained broadly against major currencies after the U.S. non-farm payrolls report showed a slowing in hiring in December but an increase in wages, setting the economy up for further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year.
The dollar hit a session high against the yen  of 116.74 yen, while the euro , after hitting a one-week high immediately after the report's release, fell to a session low of $1.0536. 
October and November figures were revised to show 19,000 more jobs added than previously reported. The U.S. economy created 2.16 million jobs in 2016 with the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings rising to 2.9 percent.
""Obviously the focus (of the market) was more on the revision from last month because if you just look at the headline number it was weaker than expected,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho. ""But if you look at it overall it essentially is a flat reading, so it’s pretty much in line with data we’re seeing in the U.S. Growth continues to be moderate.""
Sterling  slipped after two days of gains and ahead of a decision in the next week or two on parliament's role in Brexit negotiations, while Mexico's peso <MXN=> was boosted by a second straight day of currency intervention from its central bank.
A Reuters poll on Friday showed that the dollar is expected to keep strengthening against the euro in the months ahead with investors putting even chances on reaching parity this year. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was at up 0.4 percent at 101.92 (DXY) after having set a 14-year high of 103.820 three days ago.
The dollar had slipped on Thursday following unimpressive U.S. employment data and a surge in the Chinese yuan as Beijing made moves to shake out large bets against its currency.
There was more action in Beijing overnight as borrowing rates for the offshore yuan  jumped to their highest in a year, with the yuan headed for its largest one-week gain since it was introduced in 2010.

The Australian  and New Zealand  dollars briefly hit three-week highs overnight after Australia posted its first trade surplus in almost three years in November.

71,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 08:10AM ET</span>",LatAm currencies enter uncharted waters in 2017 under Trump: Reuters poll,"By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Latin American currencies are set for another choppy year in 2017, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, with strategists still scrambling to gauge the impact of Donald Trump's presidency in the United States.
The survey suggested all major Latin American currencies would probably weaken this year, with the Mexican peso constantly flirting with new lows and the Brazilian real giving back part of 2016's massive gains.  
The extent of the drops seemed highly uncertain, however, as investors still await details on Trump's policies. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has pledged to erect a border wall with Mexico and impose higher trade tariffs. 
His proposals to spur growth through fiscal policies are also expected to lead to higher U.S. interest rates, which would in turn reduce the allure of Latin American currencies.
""Clearly, any forecast for the peso has to be given a wide berth for potential swings in either direction, given that U.S. trade policy is now up in the air,"" CIBC economists wrote. 
The median estimate for the Mexican peso at the end of 2017 stood at 21.5 per dollar, the poll showed. The 26 forecasts were collected from Tuesday through Thursday, considering a reference rate of 20.73 for the peso, its closing level on Monday.
The range of forecasts was the widest since the poll's current format was introduced five years ago. Most estimates ranged between 18.55 and 23.50, but one strategist, from Nomura, projected the peso at 28 in December. 
Mexico's central bank has fueled some uncertainty, having tried to fight speculators on Thursday by selling at least $1 billion in a surprise intervention.
Some have wondered whether investors are overstating the U.S. president-elect's potential impact. 
""Trump's margin of maneuver is not so high, so the possibility of a super dollar is low,"" said Catalina Tobón, head of strategy and research at Old Mutual in Colombia.
Elsewhere in Latin America, strategists expect the Argentine peso to weaken 11 percent to 18 per dollar by year-end and the Colombian peso to lose 5 percent to trade at 3150 per dollar.
The poll showed Brazil's real weakening 6 percent to 3.49 per dollar as the central bank is expected to step up the pace of interest rate cuts to fight the nation's recession. But the forecasts also remained spread across a wide range, varying between 3.0 and 3.9 per dollar for the end of the year.

Even though the real has strengthened to nearly two-month highs this week, forecasts remained broadly unchanged from a December poll in a sign that the rally of the past few days will probably be short-lived.

72,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 07:45AM ET</span>",Bitcoin tumbles 10% as Chinese central bank advises rational investment,"Investing.com - Prices of web-based digital currency Bitcoin sank for a second consecutive day on Thursday, as China warned investors to be rational about their trading in virtual currencies.
Bitcoin fell more than 10% on Friday, passing back below $900 on the New York-based itBit exchange, following losses of nearly 12% in the prior session.
The virtual currency had managed to recover from a 23% drop at intraday lows on Thursday to end the session at $1,002.86.
But selling pressure returned on Friday as the People’s Bank of China warned investors to take a rational approach to invesment in a currency that had shown “abnormal fluctuations”.
Bitcoin is digital cash and is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.
Other big exchanges such as Bitfinex, Kraken and BitStamp also showed the cryptocurrency falling back below $900 early Friday.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency sank 11.7%, to $888.27.
Prices on U.S.-based exchanges rallied to as high as $1,150 on Wednesday, less than $100 below its November 2013 all-time high of $1,216.
The digital currency rose nearly 125% in 2016 amid heavy buying from China and India, as investors look to shield themselves from currency depreciations, capital controls and cash crunches.
U.S. and European buyers also accounted for the bulk of trading volume, as traders look for safe havens following dramatic political shifts in the world economy.
Analysts had said that prices of the digital currency looked set to test all-time highs of $1,216 in the near-term. Some even expect it to reach price parity with gold later this year amid increasing demand for alternative assets."
73,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 07:40AM ET</span>","U.S. dollar to extend rally in 2017, may hit one-to-one with euro: Reuters poll","By Sumanta Dey
(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will keep strengthening against the euro with even chances of reaching parity this year, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump's planned tax cuts will force interest rates higher.
It was also expected to strengthen against Britain's pound and to stay buoyant against a basket of major currencies.
The findings suggest a good amount of optimism still prevails among currency strategists about the impact Trump's policies will have on growth, inflation and interest rates, especially considering the dollar has rallied almost 4 percent to a near 14-year peak last year.
In the months before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, most foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said the dollar would decline 2 to 3 percent immediately after a Trump victory, a view they have abandoned altogether.
A little under two-thirds of analysts who answered an extra question in the poll said their forecasts for the dollar were more likely to be low than high. 
Several of those responses came after minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting revealed policymakers had begun factoring in the likelihood of greater fiscal stimulus into their forecasts, suggesting rates could rise faster than the three moves currently predicted by them.
""The Fed's thinking seems to have shifted already with its dots moving higher in December, compared to last year when they mostly moved lower, and that signals a period of dollar strength,"" said Eric Viloria, FX strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), the top forecaster for major currencies in Reuters polls in 2016.
""Dots"" refers to a scatter chart of where Fed members see rates a year ahead.
But Viloria cautioned the dollar is well into its typical long-term cycle: ""So I think there could be some further rise this year but a turning point after that cannot be ruled out either.""
The latest poll of 60 strategists taken this week forecasts the dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major currencies (DXY), <=USD>, at 101.5 by end-2017. That is roughly where it is now, but only after surging over 40 percent since mid-2011.
Since the election, traders have been piling on long positions with the exception of the week before Christmas, according to CFTC data.
Expectations of further gains have dented the outlook for almost every other currency around the world from Asia to Europe to Latin America, Reuters poll data shows.
Trump takes office later this month. There remain considerable uncertainties about his policies with regard to trade and China and the extent to which he would go to fulfill his protectionist election promises.
""His middle-of-the-night tweets are going to be an additional source of concern as financial markets attempt to slice and interpret his message,"" said Khoon Goh of ANZ, the number one Asian currencies forecaster in Reuters Polls in 2016.
EURO NEAR PARITY?
After calling for the euro to rise right until the U.S. election result, strategists have once again taken to forecasting a weaker euro owing to diverging monetary policy between the Fed and European Central Bank, as well as important elections in several euro zone countries.
""The main risk of the euro falling down further against the dollar should come from elections in Netherlands, France, Germany, and maybe in Italy. In case of a very large vote in favor of eurosceptic candidates or parties, the euro should suffer,"" said Jean Louis Mourier, economist at Aurel BGC in Paris.
While the 12-month consensus is for the euro to weaken to $1.04 from $1.06 now, respondents gave a median 50 percent chance of it reaching or falling below parity to the dollar in 2017, not seen since late 2002 when it was on its way up.
That probability is the highest in at least the past two years, and half the 60 respondents had a euro forecast at or below $1 at some point in the poll horizon, compared with little less than a third of participants in a poll last month.
The euro zone economy has started the year on solid ground, private sector growth in activity the fastest in five years in December and inflation climbing to 1.1 percent, but still well below the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.
There has been some talk about whether the ECB ought to consider shutting down its monthly asset purchases program or even to raise rates. But the ECB's decision in mid-2011 to hike rates pre-emptively went awry, fanning the currency bloc's festering debt crisis, and won't be easily forgotten.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling will slip a touch more against the euro and dollar after Britain begins its official divorce process from the European Union, a Reuters poll found, while identifying risks that the falls could be steeper.
The pound  has fallen about 17 percent against the dollar since the June 23 vote to leave the EU, trading near $1.24 on Friday, and according to the poll of around 60 foreign exchange strategists surveyed this week it will dip a little further.
In a month's time it will be worth $1.22 but at the end of March, by when Prime Minister Theresa May aims to trigger Article 50 which starts the two-year countdown to Brexit, the poll said cable would be at $1.21.
""In the wake of the very strong UK data the fact that sterling has lagged other currencies slightly against the dollar suggests politics is dominating,"" said Colin Asher at Mizuho Securities.
""I would expect that to continue probably for most of the year. Sterling will be difficult to predict given the very substantial negative positioning,"" added Asher, who was the most accurate forecaster of sterling in Reuters polls last year.
There have been no clear indications as to what direction negotiations will take, but many think May will take a hard line on immigration at the potential expense of Britain's access to the single market, hindering trade and further hurting sterling.
So in six months and in a year's time, medians in the poll said cable would be at $1.20. 
The dollar rallied in 2016 and that will continue this year on expectations that tax cuts promised by President-elect Donald Trump will force the Federal Reserve to raise rates more quickly. [EUR/POLL]
Pound forecasts were lowered a little from a December poll and with no clarity about how the talks will proceed, 17 of 27 people who answered an extra question said risks to their forecasts were negative.
""Risks are to the downside because the Brexit process is uncharted territory. However, if the UK is granted access to the single market, sterling should be able to recover,"" said Asmara Jamaleh at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP).
While no-one forecast the pound would fall as low as parity with the greenback, a few thought it could go below $1.10. The most optimistic analyst pegged sterling at $1.35 at the end of the year.
Sterling has struggled against the euro (EURGBP=) but only two analysts in the poll thought the two currencies would reach parity.

Medians in the poll said one euro, currently worth 85.5 pence, would get you 85.0p in a month, 86.0p in three months and 87.0p at the end of the year.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Emerging Asian currencies this year are set to extend their fall from 2016, as expectations of faster rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher, a Reuters poll showed.
Leading the losses will likely be the Chinese yuan, which slumped around 6.6 percent in 2016 and was one of the main reasons for financial market volatility, despite Beijing supporting it by burning through reserves to offset the impact of outflows.
These broad conclusions from the views of many dozens of foreign exchange strategists took into consideration a dramatic 1 percent appreciation in Beijing's partly-managed currency in the first trading days of the year.
On Friday, the People's Bank of China sharply raised the midpoint for the yuan by 0.9 percent to 6.8668 per dollar, the biggest daily hike since removing a dollar peg more than a decade ago, in yet another attempt to thwart a steady fall in the currency.
""What happens in the U.S. this year, whether it is the Fed's rate hikes or Trump's fiscal policies, will drive Asian currencies through the dollar and we are forecasting another year of depreciation across the board,"" said Khoon Goh at ANZ, who was the most accurate forecaster of Asian foreign exchange rates in Reuters polls in 2016.
""But some high-yielding economies with stronger fundamentals such as India and Indonesia are in a better position to weather those setbacks, compared to South Korea and Taiwan where the follow through from China will be felt much more.""
The poll of almost 60 currency strategists taken this week showed the yuan  will weaken over 4 percent this year to 7.20 by end-December 2017 from Friday's 6.91. It is forecast to fall to 7.00 by end-March and 7.10 by end-June.
That 12-month consensus view is the weakest in several years of Reuters polls and, if reached, would mark the lowest level for the closely managed yuan in nearly a decade. The weakest forecast was even lower, at 7.60 per dollar.
While upcoming economic data from China are expected to show it entered 2017 on a solid footing, the fact that it has come on the back of renewed aggressive government spending has raised concerns of an eventual slowdown and continued capital flight.
China's FX reserves likely fell to $3 trillion in December from $3.052 trillion in November, the lowest since April 2011, according to a separate Reuters poll -- extending a trend in place during most of last year that highlights the difficulty Beijing faces in preventing the yuan from falling rapidly.
Adding to those risks are Trump's promises to brand China a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on Chinese goods, both of which could further escalate tensions between the two top economies.
""2017 is going to be a year when investors try to second-guess what Trump does and we are probably in for quite a bit of volatility,"" Goh at ANZ added.
Fed policymakers have already begun factoring in assumptions of greater fiscal stimulus, and consequently higher growth, into their forecasts, minutes from its December meeting showed this week, suggesting rates could rise faster than the three moves predicted by them now.
That is likely to propel U.S. bond yields and the dollar higher, in turn denting currencies around the world.
With growth slowing down in several Asian economies from China to India to Indonesia over the past few years, the path of their currencies going forward will probably be a major factor affecting the course of regional economies.
The latest poll predicted losses were likely for all major Asian currencies, with the Taiwan dollar  falling 3.5 percent by end-December, the second most after the yuan.
The South Korean won  is forecast to lose 2 percent, while the Philippine peso , which is usually buffeted by relations between the country and China, is expected to depreciate 3 percent this year, adding to last year's 5.3 percent slide.
India's rupee  is expected to weaken 2.5 percent owing to a weakened economy following the government's currency crackdown and rising global yields. [INR/POLL]

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan traded in the offshore market is set for its biggest weekly gain on Friday, hovering around two-month highs after the authorities were suspected of pushing up overnight borrowing costs to discourage bearish bets on the currency.
Both onshore  and offshore yuan  have been rallying this week, driven predominantly by a blow-up in yuan borrowing costs offshore and tighter liquidity. The spread between the two spot rates widened to its highest since 2010.
Chinese authorities are keen to deter speculation in the currency and analysts and traders suspect policymakers have sought to prevent it from weakening to the 7-per-dollar level ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.
Traders said the market had long held a strong ""one-way"" expectation of depreciation in the yuan and the rally in the currency over the week was the authorities' attempt to alter such views.
But while policymakers may have some success in the short-run in arresting the yuan's descent, pressure will remain on the yuan to depreciate over time, they said.
""I don't think the volatility in the yuan so far this week will reverse the trend of depreciation. But the yuan is at least unlikely to have another rapid fall ahead of the Lunar New Year,"" said a Shanghai-based trader at a foreign bank, referring to the week-long holiday starting at the end of January.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the official midpoint  for the yuan, which is allowed to move in a tight band around that guidance rate, at 6.8668 per dollar prior to the market opening, 639 pips or 0.9 percent, firmer than the previous fixing.
That made it the largest upward move since the yuan was revalued and taken off a fixed dollar peg in July 2005.
By 0706 GMT, onshore spot yuan was trading at 6.9334 per dollar, down 0.7 percent from late Thursday. The Chinese currency, however, is around 0.2 percent higher than Friday's close and is on track to log its best week in more than a month.
Onshore yuan's retreat on Friday was a result of increasing dollar demand by companies after the U.S. currency eased off 14-year highs, said a trader at a Chinese bank.
BATTLING YUAN BEARS
Interbank rates for the offshore yuan  have been surging this week, suggesting China is keen to squeeze speculators by making it prohibitively expensive to short-sell the yuan. Yuan liquidity conditions in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan hub, have been tightening.
Overnight yuan interbank rates in Hong Kong were fixed at 61.333 percent on Friday, up sharply from 38.335 percent on Thursday, while yuan deposit rates implied by the offshore forward market  ballooned to 112 percent before easing.
Some of the pressure on yuan funding has also been on account of a drying up of yuan deposits in Hong Kong as investors steadily lost faith in a currency which fell 6.6 percent in 2016, its biggest annual fall since 1994.
China's currency reserves data due this week is also expected to show reserves are close to falling below the critical $3 trillion figure, which would partly explain the authorities' desire to stem capital outflows and bets that the currency will keep depreciating.
The offshore yuan, or CNH, has risen about 2.5 percent since Tuesday, with its gains over Wednesday and Thursday being the biggest two-day gains since its introduction in 2010.
Its rally rippled across major currency markets, causing the U.S. dollar to give up some of its recent gains against the euro and yen.
Still, few seem to be altering their expectations for a weaker yuan in the coming months.
""We believe the surge in the CNH is not sustainable,"" Gao Qi, FX strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore, wrote in a note.
Gao expects the yuan to depreciate about 5 percent against the dollar this year amid market worries over potential political and trade conflicts between the United States and China after Trump takes office.
China's central bank will not tolerate sustained depreciation of the yuan, the China Securities Journal said on Friday.
The Chinese currency was not obviously over-valued, and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar has its upper limit, it said in a commentary.

""Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax,"" Trump said on Twitter. USD/JPY changed hands 115.79, up 0.37%, while AUD/USD was mostly flat at 0.7336. Nonfarm payrolls data from the U.S. later Friday is expected to set the tone for the dollar.
In Australia, the trade balance showed a surplus of A$1.243 billion, wider thant he deficit of A$500 million expected.
The People's Bank of China set the yuan central parity rate against the U.S. dollar stronger at 6.8668 Friday compared with 6.9307 set on Thursday, marking the second rise in a row after the eight year low it set Wednesday. The offshore yuan has jumped as high as 6.7850 against the dollar as the central bank via state-owned bank proxies has stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan this week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last quoted up 0.30 to 101.69.
Overnight, the U.S. dollar was lower against a basket of the other major currencies on Thursday after Federal Reserve minutes that pointed to uncertainty over the potential impact of the incoming Trump administration’s policies on the economy.
The index hit 14-year peaks on Tuesday as strong U.S. factory data fed into expectations for a faster pace of monetary tightening in 2017.
But the greenback came under pressure after Wednesday’s minutes from the Fed’s December 13-14 meeting showed that officials noted “considerable uncertainty"" over the policy direction of President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration.
Trump will take office on January 20 and has yet to outline his economic policies in detail.
The minutes also showed the recent appreciation in the dollar could lead to a slower pace of rate hikes.
The Fed noted that “a further strengthening in the dollar could lead to tighter financial conditions that restrain economic activity and inflation—a key downside risk.”
U.S. data on Thursday showed that initial jobless claims fell by 27,500 to 235,000, an almost 43 year low.
Another report showed that the U.S. private sector added 153,000 jobs in December, below expectations for a gain of 170,000.Analysts were looking ahead to Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for December for indications on solid growth in the labor market which could enable the Fed to keep pushing up interest rates.
Higher rates typically boost the dollar by making dollar assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 02:08PM ET</span>",Mexico central bank sells $1 billion to prop peso after Trump slump: traders,"By Miguel Gutierrez and Adriana Barrera
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's central bank sold dollars in Mexico and New York on Thursday to fight off the peso's nose dive to record lows amid fears U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's protectionist policies could further hammer Latin America's second-biggest economy.
The central bank sold at least $1 billion in U.S. currency in morning trade, four traders told Reuters, asking not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The bank kept the amount confidential.
Mexico's currency commission said in a separate statement that the move was aimed at providing liquidity and combating recent volatility in the peso, adding that it could not rule out further discretionary intervention to support the currency. 
The dollar sales mark the bank's first currency intervention since February 2016, when it sold $2 billion to prop up the sinking peso. The peso depreciated 20 percent last year alone and was among the world's worst performing currencies.
Banco Base said in a report following the intervention that the decision was aimed at combating ""speculative positions"" that had built up against the peso.
Mexico's peso  strengthened after the intervention was reported, but trade was choppy and it pared gains to trade flat around 21.48 per dollar after Trump threatened Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) with a ""big border tax"" if it followed through on plans to build a new factory in Mexico to build cars for the U.S. market.
The peso posted a record low at 21.624 per dollar on Wednesday after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Dec. 13-14 meeting hinted that faster rate hikes could be needed under Trump.
Historically the impact of Mexico's currency interventions have tended to be short-lived, and the peso has continued to trend lower.
Juan Garcia, director of national operations for the central bank, confirmed the surprise sales and said they would continue through the day, but he declined to specify volumes.
Prior to the February intervention, the Banco de Mexico had sold dollars in rules-based auctions since a deep slump in the peso in 2014. The February dollar sales were a major policy shift and marked the first time the bank opted for direct dollar sales since the 2009 financial crisis.
On Tuesday, the peso was rocked by Ford Motor Co's (N:F) decision to cancel a planned $1.6 billion investment in central Mexico. 
Also, a major fuel price hike that took effect on Jan. 1 has stirred inflation fears and provoked numerous protests and some looting. President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday defended the hike.
The currency fall continued on Wednesday and was compounded by the Fed's minutes showing policymakers were concerned that quicker economic growth under Trump could require faster interest-rate increases in the United States.
Trump's election win drove the Mexican currency steadily lower, with the sell-off fueled by his threats to scrap a trade deal between Mexico and the United States, and to levy punitive tariffs on Mexican-made goods.

On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to halt money transfers from Mexican nationals in the United States unless the country agreed to pay for the massive wall he has vowed to build on the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants.

The Chicago-based group's (O:CME) head of FX, Paul Houston, said the expansion of its current quarterly contracts was in response to demand from clients and may help fill a shortfall of funding that has helped cut overall global FX volumes in recent years. 
With financial investors running up against limits on the capital they need to hold against over-the-counter currency derivatives trades, industry figures say exchange-based products like those offered by CME are one natural way of filling the gap.
Volumes at CME, while still smaller than those on the spot currency trading platforms run by Thomson Reuters (TO:TRI) and NEX Group (L:NXGN), have risen steadily and now run at around $84 billion a day.
The new contracts include U.S. dollar rates against the euro, yen, British pound and Australian and Canadian dollars as well as the euro against sterling and will allow investors to hedge for four consecutive monthly periods. 
""The launch of FX monthly futures is in response to feedback from global customers who want to trade FX futures for the capital efficiencies they bring but require increased granularity to meet their hedging needs,"" Houston said.

""We are a central counterparty so we can help solve any credit issues, and part of the launch of the monthlies is to offer clients more choice.""

82,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 12:09PM ET</span>",Bitcoin plunges as much as 20 percent as Chinese yuan soars,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - A dramatic rally in digital currency bitcoin came to a spectacular end on Thursday with a plunge of up to 20 percent as China's yuan rose sharply - further evidence of an intriguing inverse relationship between the pair.
Bitcoin had gained more than 40 percent in two weeks to hit a three-year high of $1,139.89 on Wednesday, just shy of its all-time record of $1,163 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange . But it dived as low as $885.41 on Thursday as the yuan jumped by over 1 percent in offshore trading and headed for its strongest two-day performance on record.  [CNY/]
Chinese exchanges have reported high volumes of trading of the web-based ""cryptocurrency"" over the past year, during which time the yuan has shed almost 7 percent, its worst annual performance since 1994, while bitcoin has surged 125 percent, outperforming all other currencies for a second year in a row.
Bitcoin can used for moving money across the globe quickly and anonymously, and operates outside the control of any central authority. That makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as in China, and also to investors who are worried about a devaluation in their currency. 
""Given that the yuan's weakness over recent months seemed to correlate with bitcoin's strength more than any other currency, it's no surprise that bitcoin traders have reacted the way they have to the yuan's sudden strength today,"" said Paul Gordon, co-founder of London-based Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for investors to access digital currency exchanges. 
Exchanges in China say they account for more than 90 percent of global bitcoin trading, which would help explain why a shift in Chinese demand would sharply affect the price.
But many bitcoin experts say Chinese exchanges overstate their volumes in the digital currency, and attribute sharp moves to speculation by, for example, U.S.-based hedge funds.
Some said bitcoin's fall was a natural reaction to the speed of its previous rise. It is still up more than 50 percent on three months ago, when it was trading at around $600, 
""If something goes up very rapidly...people make a lot of money, and at some point they’re going to want to sell, in order to realize their gains,"" said Marco Streng, CEO of bitcoin mining and trading firm Genesis Mining. 
By 1645 GMT (11:45 a.m. ET), bitcoin had recovered some of its earlier losses to trade down almost 15 percent on the day at around $950, still leaving it on course for its worst performance in a year. 
On some digital currency exchanges - of which there are dozens - bitcoin did reach record highs late on Wednesday.
""Once we broke through the nominal all-time high, liquidity dried up - no shorts, no sellers, which means a volatile little bubble formed quickly,"" said Peter Smith, CEO of London-based Blockchain, the biggest bitcoin wallet-provider globally. 
""We are seeing the effects of that now as it breaks. It's still fairly thin trading volume though, so who really knows where it goes next.""

The loonie, as Canada's currency is also known, remained on the back foot even as oil prices climbed on optimism that an agreement between major producers to cut production will be effective in rebalancing the market.
Higher prices for oil, one of Canada's major exports, typically boost the Canadian dollar.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 07:47AM ET</span>",Yuan's surge knocks dollar as China moves on speculators,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan sent currency markets spinning on Thursday, driving the dollar broadly lower and threatening to quash one of the central bets of global investors for 2017.
A rise in overnight borrowing costs in Hong Kong to 96 percent helped the yuan rack up the biggest two-day rise for the offshore version of its currency since its launch in 2010.  
That in turn triggered a broader round of profit-taking on the dollar, sending it more than 1 percent lower against the yen and as low as $1.0575 per euro before a late-morning recovery in Europe.   
A year after a tussle between Beijing and hedge funds betting against the currency, many major asset managers and banks have called for the yuan to fall in 2017. Dealers said the moves had the potential to squeeze many players out of those positions just five days into January. 
By midday in Europe, the yuan was just under half a percent higher on the day against the dollar at 6.8364 , having gained almost 3 percent from lows hit on Tuesday. 
""They have kick-started a move that has washed out short-term speculative money,"" currency fund Millennium Global's co-head of portfolio management, Richard Benson, said.
""This isn't economics. China desperately doesn't want a repeat of what happened this time last year (and it seems) attack is the best part of defense.""
Many banks and investors have also lined up bets on a broadly stronger dollar in the year ahead, trusting that a Donald Trump White House will raise public spending, spur inflation and encourage repatriation of corporate funds held abroad.
But the dollar's failure to move closer to parity with the euro, or to 120 yen, since mid-December has fueled doubts about its ability to gain further, at least before Trump's inauguration.
""The Trump bears kept quiet in December because there was no point in fighting the battle then. They seem to be emerging now,"" Benson said. ""It is not just against the yuan. It looks to me highly suspicious that dollar can't get below $1.0375 (per euro)."" 
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) <=USD> slipped to as low as 101.86, a three-week low, just two days after it had hit a 14-year high of 103.82 on Tuesday, when a strong reading from a U.S. manufacturing survey boosted the greenback. It was a third of a percent lower on the day at 102.33 by 1220 GMT (7:20 a.m. ET).
The euro  rose as much as 0.7 percent in Asia to $1.0563 before trimming those gains to 0.2 percent. The dollar still 0.6 percent weaker at 116.61 yen. 
""Tighter (Chinese) capital controls are a stop-gap measure that may plug one hole but won't prevent another one emerging elsewhere. Further ... weakness seems inevitable to us,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analyst Kit Juckes.
""However, challenging the market narrative that has seen investors and traders pile into the dollar since early November is enough to trigger a sharp cutback of longs, not just in USD/CNH but across G10 currencies.""

GBP/USD touched an intra-day high of 1.2322 immediately following the data, before pulling back to 1.2295, trading at levels seen ahead of the report's release.
The Markit services purchasing managers' index rose to 56.2 in December from November's 55.2, compared to analysts’ expectations for a reading of 54.7.
Similar surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors earlier in the week also beat expectations.
Collectively, the PMI surveys point to the economy growing by 0.5% in the final quarter of 2016, the report said.
“A buoyant service sector adds to signs that the UK economy continues to defy widely-held expectations of a Brexit-driven slowdown,” Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson said.
The report also indicated that inflationary pressures are picking up with prices charged by service providers rising at the fastest pace since April 2011, due to the steep drop in sterling since the June 23 Brexit vote.
The euro pared back gains against the pound following the report, with EUR/GBP at 0.8535, up 0.29% for the day, from around 0.8543 ahead of the data.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 04:30AM ET</span>",China's yuan soars against dollar as liquidity tightens offshore,"HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan soared against the U.S. dollar on Thursday following a sharp rise in the offshore spot rate as China worked to stem capital flows and stabilize the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president and the Lunar New Year.
The offshore yuan  gained 0.8 percent against the dollar and traded at 6.8151 as of 0830 GMT (3.30 a.m. ET), driven up by a rising cost of funds in Hong Kong and trading firmer than the onshore spot rate for a second straight day.
It was not clear if Chinese authorities had engineered the spike in yuan borrowing rates in Hong Kong. But they had used such a tactic several times last year to support offshore yuan exchange levels and by extension relieving some of the pressure on the yuan onshore, which is at more than eight-year lows.
The cost of borrowing yuan surged in Hong Kong, with the rate of overnight contracts  jumping to its highest level in nearly a year.
The CNH Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate benchmark (CNH Hibor), set by the city's Treasury Markets Association (TMA), rose to 38.33500 percent for overnight contracts, the highest since Jan. 12, 2016. It was 16.94767 percent on Wednesday.
With signs of short-term liquidity stress, the implied overnight deposit rate for the offshore yuan  stood at 90.393 percent as of 0830 GMT, after soaring as high as 101.694 percent earlier on Thursday. 
The rate closed at 10.587 percent a day earlier.
BIG ONSHORE GAIN
Onshore, the yuan was on track for its biggest one-day gain since the first quarter of 2016.
""London traders have come into the market in the afternoon and that's why you saw another round of yuan short sellers squaring their positions,"" said a trader with an American bank in Hong Kong.
The yuan is limited onshore to trading within a 2 percent band on either side of a reference rate set each day by the central bank. But offshore, it can move more freely, which accounts for the different exchange rates.
Traders in the onshore market said they were primarily trying to stop the bleeding on Thursday.
""The onshore market is reacting to the offshore as traders were liquidating their positions to prevent further losses,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank in Shanghai.
Another trader at a foreign bank said the sell-offs kicked off at the market open, right after the central bank fixed a stronger-than-expected midpoint at 6.9307 per dollar, the strongest in nearly three weeks. The previous fix was 6.9526.
Other Asian currencies rose on Thursday in response to the surging yuan.
The spot market  opened at 6.9280 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.8817 at 4:30 p.m, 489 pips stronger than the previous late session close and 0.71 percent firmer than the midpoint.
The yuan had settled at 6.9485 at 4:30 pm on Wednesday, and finished that day's late session at 6.9306.
Some analysts said the liquidity conditions in Hong Kong were unlikely to improve in the short term as the peak season for cash demand - the Lunar New Year holiday - was nearing. This year, the holiday starts just before the end of January.
Beijing has recently rolled out a slew of measures to stabilize the Chinese currency including tightening scrutiny on individuals' foreign exchange purchases. 
Some analysts said the Chinese government was keen to keep the yuan stable around Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump had threatened during the election campaign to slap high import tariffs on Chinese goods and label Beijing a currency manipulator.
The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index (RXYH), which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 97.3, firmer than the previous day's 96.47. 
The global dollar index (DXY) fell to 102.17 from the previous close of 102.7. 
Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs), considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan's value, traded at 7.136, 2.88 percent weaker than the midpoint.

One-year NDFs are settled against the midpoint, not the spot rate.

93,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2017 03:18PM ET</span>","Fears of protectionist Trump, Fed minutes drive Mexico peso to new low","By Miguel Gutierrez
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso dropped to a new low on Wednesday, falling more than 2 percent amid worries over the prospect of protectionist policies by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and after Fed policymakers fretted he could stoke U.S. inflation.
The peso   dipped as low as 21.624 per dollar, after pushing past the previous bottom of 21.395 set on Nov. 11, soon after Trump's surprise Nov. 8 presidential election victory.
The peso's nosedive deepened after minutes from the Fed's Dec. 13-14 meeting showed policymakers were concerned that quicker economic growth under Trump could require faster interest-rate increases in the United States.
On Tuesday, the peso was rocked by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.'s decision to cancel a planned $1.6 billion investment in central Mexico, while fears over inflation have been stirred by a major fuel price hike that took effect on Jan. 1 - which President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday defended.
""With this Ford announcement, markets are clearly seeing the risk of protectionist measures toward Mexico,"" said Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist at Banorte-IXE.
""A scenario in which Trump is very aggressive in terms of policies toward Mexico is not yet priced into the market, and the Ford announcement reflects that,"" he added. 
Trump's election win drove the Mexican currency lower amid a sell-off fueled by his threats to scrap a trade deal between Mexico and the United States, and to levy punitive tariffs on Mexican-made goods.
He railed against Mexico on the campaign trail, threatening to halt transfers from Mexican nationals in the United States unless Mexico agreed to pay for the massive wall he has vowed to build on the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants.
The Mexican fuel price increase stemmed from the finance ministry's decision to put an end to government-set prices, but the size of the rises also spurred some protests in Mexico, prompting speculation that the government could seek to stagger the increase.

So far, officials have ruled out any such move and Pena Nieto said on Wednesday that the government had been obliged to act given international oil prices.

On its first trading day of the new year, bitcoin crossed above the $1,000 mark for the first time since 2013.
Bitcoin is up 90% since the beginning of September, and enjoyed a blistering 2016 as it gained 123%, making it the  top performing currency for the second year in a row.
Bitcoin's gains have been buoyed by renewed interest from China, where money is rushing out of the country as its currency, the yuan, continues to weaken. China's foreign-exchange reserves shrunk by about 8% in 2016 to $3.05 trillion as of November. The outflows have pushed the yuan to its weakest levels against the dollar since 2008.
According to a recent Business Insider Intelligence briefing, citing data from  Cryptocompare, ""In the first 24 hours of the new year, over 5 million bitcoins were bought in Chinese yuan, equating to $3.8 billion. In contrast, just 53,000 bitcoins were bought in US dollars.""
And things aren't likely to get better any time soon unless China to takes action to stop the bleeding as the Fed ratcheted up its 2017 rate hike expectations to three from two. If those rate hikes were to happen, an even weaker yuan is likely in the cards, creating an even more beneficial scenario for bitcoin.

100,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2017 08:31AM ET</span>",Dollar edges down from 14-year high as euro gets data boost,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged down from a 14-year high against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, with investors cautious about increasing bets on the greenback before getting fresh clues on the U.S. economy and the timing of interest rate rises. 
The dollar surged to its highest levels since late 2002 on Tuesday - the first day of trading in 2017 for most financial centers - after U.S. manufacturing data beat expectations, once again threatening to reach parity with the euro, which fell to a 14-year low of $1.0340.  
But the single currency climbed 0.3 percent on Wednesday to $1.0435, boosted by data showing euro zone prices rose faster than expected in December and surveys suggesting business growth reached its highest in more than five years.
That left it almost a cent above the trough hit on Tuesday, but some way off a three-week peak of $1.07 touched during a bout of low liquidity last week and over 6 percent lower compared with two months ago. 
""The data coming from Europe is supportive for the euro, but only at the margins,"" said MUFG currency economist Lee Hardman, in London. 
""Ultimately, the feed-through into the euro is dampened by the fact that the ECB (European Central Bank) has already announced an extension of its QE (quantitative easing) program into the end of this year. So it's unlikely that the data is going to be strong enough in the near term to prompt a reassessment."" 
The dollar has climbed almost 6 percent since Donald Trump was elected as U.S. president eight weeks ago, on expectations that his new administration will introduce reflationary measures backed by large fiscal spending, prompting the Federal Reserve to follow through with a series of interest rate hikes.
But with investors already pricing in two to three rate increases this year, analysts reckon they will want to see more evidence that growth and inflation are rising and that the pace of rate hikes will accelerate before putting on more bets on the dollar. 
HSBC, nevertheless, changed its forecasts late on Tuesday to show the euro falling to $1.01 in the first quarter, down from $1.08 previously, though they expect the dollar will then slip back for the rest of the year, never reaching parity. 
The dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals - fell 0.3 percent to 102.94 (DXY), having hit a peak of 103.82 on Tuesday. 
""Yes, we've had some good U.S. data, but we've also had stronger (European) data,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, in London. 
""Are investors really prepared to push above those 14-year highs to make that extra move down to parity? I suspect the market may need a bit more incentive to do that.""
The dollar was seen facing potential turbulence before Friday's highly anticipated U.S. non-farm payrolls report.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>",China steps in to support yuan again as Trump inauguration nears,"By Michelle Chen and John Ruwitch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan for a second day on Wednesday, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
The central bank set a stronger-than-expected daily trading midpoint for the yuan, state banks sold dollars and borrowing rates for the offshore component of the yuan rose, all hinting at state intervention to stem losses in the currency.
The moves helped the yuan  inch up 0.1 despite strength in the global dollar index, while the offshore yuan  hit a two-week high.
Global investors' jitters over the yuan are intensifying ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. He had threatened during the election campaign to slap high import tariffs on Chinese goods and label Beijing a currency manipulator. 
The supportive yuan midpoints and surge in borrowing rates suggested the People's Bank of China might have stepped up its action to defend the yuan to keep it from breaching the 7 per dollar level, Ken Cheung, Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong, said in a note to clients.
""Trump's actual policy delivery and his stance against China are critical to the dollar and yuan direction in 2017,"" Cheung said. 
""While China-U.S. tensions have been heating up in December, any provocation from Trump’s administration after he takes office will easily escalate the risk of a trade war and spark a heavy CNH sell-off.""
The PBOC set the midpoint rate  at 6.9526 per dollar prior to the market open, weaker than the previous fix of 6.9498.
In the spot market <CNY=CFXS>, the yuan opened at 6.9565 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.9540 at 0800 GMT, stronger than the previous close.
It fell 6.6 percent against the dollar last year, its biggest one-year loss since 1994, and many market watchers expect it to soften further this year, forcing Beijing to burn through more of its foreign exchange reserves if it wants to stabilize it.
""The central bank is in the market to stop the yuan from falling too quickly,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank in Shanghai.
""The yuan fixing was stronger than expected today, and also state banks continue to offer dollars in the market,"" the trader said.
The offshore yuan was trading 5 percent stronger than the onshore spot at 6.9231 per dollar. 
Offshore money markets have been tight all week, with the overnight yuan borrowing rate climbing on Tuesday to its highest level in more than three months.
The CNH Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate benchmark (CNH Hibor) for overnight tenor HICNHONDF=, set by the city's Treasury Markets Association (TMA), was fixed at 16.95 percent on Wednesday.
The rate was fixed at 17.76 percent a day earlier, the highest since Sept. 19.
Analysts said the surge in borrowing costs was a result of a shrinking yuan pool in Hong Kong, a result of fewer people seeking yuan-denominated assets owing to expectations the currency will weaken further.
""The depreciation expectation of the yuan remains and it takes time for investors to rebuild their confidence in the Chinese currency,"" said Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International.
""Meanwhile, China has been making efforts to control capital outflows."" 
Forward markets showed investors still expect the yuan to weaken. Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs)  traded at 7.285, or 4.56 percent weaker than the midpoint.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2017 11:35AM ET</span>","Dollar back on trend, hits two-week high vs. yen","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar racked up its biggest rise in more than two weeks in 2017's first full day of European trading on Tuesday, as dealers and investors in London returned to push the greenback close to December's long-term highs. 
One of January's big question-marks, China's yuan, was proving more stable in its more freely traded offshore markets, a bullish survey of manufacturing purchasing managers helping it 0.1 percent higher and also supporting the Australian dollar. 
A bout of year-end profit-taking had halted progress in the index used to measure the U.S. currency's strength against a basket of its peers and weakened it to as much as $1.07 per euro last week. 
It rose 1.3 percent on the day on Tuesday to trade at 103.51 against the index, compared to a 14-year high of 103.65 hit on Dec. 20. It was up 0.7 percent at $1.0377 per euro and 118.29 yen, the latter rate its strongest since Dec. 16. 
Analysts with some of Europe's biggest banks argued for a resumption of the drive that has led the greenback sharply higher since elections in early November on expectations Donald Trump will provide a boost to public spending and growth.
""In the near term the market should probably pick up where it left off, we're certainly seeing that ... this morning,"" said Barclays' G10 currency strategist Hamish Pepper. 
""The past fortnight wasn't a period that materially changed the trend that was dominant into the end of the year and it is hard to see the data or the Fed minutes this week changing that.""
A holiday in Japan thinned trade in Asia, but the yuan gained 0.1 percent in offshore markets after the Caixin/Markit survey showed Chinese factory activity picked up more than expected in December, with output reaching a near six-year high.
A rise in overnight rates in Hong Kong  also made it prohibitively expensive for speculators to fund bets against the Chinese currency, adding to regulatory moves taken to halt investment-led outflows of capital at the start of the year. 
The greenback has been on the rise since September, but its jet higher since Trump's election has prompted speculation of an attack on parity with the euro. 
Treasury yields have jumped in anticipation of more U.S. government borrowing and higher Federal Reserve interest rates at a time when central banks in the euro zone and Japan are working to keep their short-term yields in negative territory.
U.S. two-year debt (US2YT=RR) pays 200 basis points (bps) more than German debt and almost 140 bps more than Japanese bonds.
Yet there have been signs of more doubt in recent weeks, with analysts beginning to wonder how much further appreciation a Trump White House will really tolerate once in office.
Analysts from Rabobank said the dollar would need substantial support from further rate rises this year to continue to rise. 
""The fact that the EUR/USD spiked to highs close to 1.0653 last week will have worried USD bulls,"" they said in a morning note. 

""Although the move higher in EUR/USD was clearly exacerbated by thin volumes, it has helped to illustrate that a move to parity could be further away than it appeared a few weeks ago.""

110,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2017 07:20AM ET</span>",Few people seen selling yuan for dollars on first day of China's forex quota re-set,"By Lusha Zhang and Engen Tham
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's authorities have sounded the alarm in recent weeks over the risk of capital outflows from the economy, but there was little evidence at Beijing and Shanghai banks on Tuesday that Chinese individuals were rushing to lock in 2017 quotas to buy foreign exchange.
Only a trickle of people at banks were seen selling yuan for dollars on the first business day of the new year, when buyers in theory could have made use of their quotas.
Under China's capital controls, individuals are permitted to buy up to $50,000 in foreign exchange a year, and data shows January is typically a standout month for onshore foreign currency deposits.
The yuan shed nearly 7 percent against the dollar last year, its poorest showing since 1994, as policymakers struggled to contain capital outflows and preserve foreign exchange reserves in the face of a slowing economy and resurgent dollar.
Authorities have tightened monitoring of foreign exchange transactions out of concern over capital outflows.
China's currency regulator this week began requiring Chinese individuals who want to buy foreign currencies to specify the purpose of the purchase and provide additional information, and said it would monitor transactions more closely and frequently as well as punish rule-breakers.
At major bank branches in two of China's biggest cities, there were no queues on Tuesday, and the few individuals who changed money reported doing so with relative ease.
SMOOTH AND QUICK
""The whole process of changing money was pretty smooth and quick,"" said an office worker surnamed Xu, who withdrew $500 from an ICBC branch in Beijing on Tuesday for a coming vacation in the United States.
Several other customers at banks in the two cities reported similar ease when changing amounts of money well below the quota.
However, it is unclear how much foreign currency exchange was being conducted online on Tuesday. Central bank data shows onshore foreign exchange deposits rose by almost 32 percent in the first 11 months of 2016, propelled in part by the yuan's fall to eight-year lows.
Aside from the rising forex deposits, there has been little indication of growing unease among ordinary Chinese - although the authorities were taking no chances, repeating a mantra that the economy is improving and there is no basis for depreciation of the yuan in the long term.
Yang Zhao, chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said there wasn't any widespread panic about the falling yuan, so he had not expected a surge in demand.
In recent months, analysts have noted that the yuan was not alone in falling against the dollar, with most other emerging market currencies also suffering, which has helped keep sentiment around the yuan from souring too much.
Zhao said restrictions on use of foreign exchange limited anyone's options and so acted as a disincentive anyhow.

""You can't buy real estate. You can't purchase anything. Basically you can only park that FX in your deposit account onshore with interest rates that are very low,"" he said.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2017 12:16AM ET</span>",China's yuan may see more volatility vs dollar after basket change,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's yuan is likely to see more volatility against the U.S. dollar this year after its foreign exchange market operator changed the way it calculates a key yuan index by nearly doubling the number of foreign currencies in its basket.
The China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) said last week it was changing the composition of the CFETS basket that is used to set the yuan's daily value. Starting on Jan. 1, the number of currencies in the basket was increased to 24 from 13. 
China has been promoting use of the index, which references a basket of currencies of its trading partners, partly to divert attention from the yuan's slide against the dollar, which comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to label Beijing a currency manipulator.
The yuan  fell almost 7 percent against the surging dollar in 2016 to near 8-1/2 year lows, and roughly 6 percent against the basket. 
The direct impact of the new basket is that the yuan index may hold up amid broad dollar strength as the impact of a big rise in the dollar will be offset by the impact of emerging market currencies' weakness on the yuan index, said OCBC analysts in a note.
""However, the new weight also implied a possible more volatile USD/CNY should China continue its basket anchor policy,"" the analysts said.
This view was echoed by ANZ analysts and some traders.
""Given a higher weighting of inherently volatile emerging market currencies, we expect higher volatility in the dollar/yuan fixing and spot rate, with uncertainty in U.S. policy (particularly U.S.-China relations) already likely to boost volatility in 2017,"" ANZ analysts said.
China's central bank set a slightly stronger than expected daily fixing for the yuan on Tuesday after the changes to its currency basket that are expected to make the yuan index less influenced by moves in the dollar. 
On the first trading day of 2017, the People's bank of China (PBOC) fixed the yuan midpoint at 6.9498 per dollar, the first fixing after China changed the composition of the currency basket used to determine the yuan's value.
Some traders said their estimate of the yuan midpoint based on the new basket was around the 6.96 area, and the stronger-than-expected fixing showed that yuan stability would remain a priority for the central bank this year.
State banks were also seen offering dollars in the market to support the yuan as demand to buy dollars was still strong.
The basket currency change is aimed at improving the mechanism generating the CFETS RMB Index <.CFSCNYI> and making the CFETS basket more representative, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) said on Thursday.
The nominal dollar weighting in the new basket has been reduced by 4 percent, according to OCBC calculations.
If taking the newly included Saudi riyal and Emirate dirham as well as the existing Hong Kong Dollar, which are all pegged to the U.S. dollar, into account, the effective dollar weighting has been cut to 30.54 percent from 32.95 percent, they said.
The yuan changed hands at 6.9548 per dollar at midday, 0.1 percent weaker than the previous close.
The U.S. dollar held firm on Tuesday as the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates this year kept sentiment bullish. [FRX/]

The yuan is expected to plumb its lowest level against the dollar in nearly a decade this year on sustained capital outflows and dollar strength, according to a Reuters poll in December.

LONDON (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin kicked off the new year by jumping above $1,000 for the first time in three years late on Sunday, having outperformed all central-bank-issued currencies with a 125 percent climb in 2016.
Bitcoin - a web-based ""cryptocurrency"" that has no central authority, relying instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new bitcoins to the system - jumped 2.5 percent to $1,022 on the Europe-based Bitstamp exchange, its highest since December 2013. 
Though the digital currency has historically been highly volatile - a tenfold increase in its value in two months in late 2013 took it to above $1,100, before a hack on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange saw it plunge to under $400 in the following weeks - it has in the past two years been more stable. 
Its biggest daily moves in 2016 were around 10 percent, still very volatile compared with fiat currencies, but markedly lower than the trading of 2013, which saw daily price swings of as much as 40 percent. 
Bitcoin may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7 percent annual fall in the value of the yuan in 2016, the Chinese currency's weakest showing in over 20 years. Data shows most bitcoin trading is done in China.
Bitcoin is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and does not fall under the purview of any authority, making it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as China's. 
It is also may appeal to those worried about a lack of supply of cash, such as in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed high-denomination bank notes from circulation in November.
""The growing war on cash, and capital controls, is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high risk, alternative,"" said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges.

Though bitcoin is still some way off the all-time high of $1,163 that it reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, there are now more bitcoins in circulation - 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a record-high above $16 billion, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar recovered from a two-week low against a basket of six major currencies on Monday, though trade was thin with many markets closed for the New Year holiday. 
The greenback had soared to 14-year highs in December, boosted by market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike rates as many as three times this year, and that President-elect Donald Trump will stoke growth and inflation with a program of fiscal expansion. 
The dollar finished the year with an almost 4 percent annual rise, the fourth consecutive year of gains
But the index that measures the currency against six major rivals lost more than 1 percent during the last three days of last week, its weakness exacerbated on Friday during a flash surge for the euro in low volumes of trading in Asia. 
The single currency jumped two full cents to as high as $1.07, before quickly retreating, prompting analysts to draw parallels with a ""flash crash"" in October that briefly knocked almost 10 percent off the value of Britain's pound.
On Monday the euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.0513 despite strong manufacturing data for the currency bloc, while the dollar index climbed half a percent to 102.68, close to the 14-year peak of 103.65 it touched on Dec. 30.
""In the last days of 2016 we saw the dollar retreat somewhat, and there might be some sense of a correction from Europe this morning. I don't see any fundamental drivers for the moves,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt. 
Data released on Friday showed speculators once again taking a bullish stance on the dollar, increasing their bets in the week up to last Tuesday after cutting their long positions for the first time since October in the previous week. 
The Swedish crown rose half a percent to a 3-1/2-month high of 9.5285 crowns per euro after the purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector rose to 60.1 points in December, up from 57.3 the previous month.
The main data focus for the week will be Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report.
""This week's NFP figure is likely to confirm (the) assumption ... that if the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) hopes to get at least two hikes in during the year, one of them should be out of the way by the middle of the year,"" wrote FXPrimus's head of investment research, Marshall Gittler.
A gun attack in Istanbul that killed 39 people was seen having little impact on the currency market, with the Japanese yen - traditionally used as a safe haven - falling against the dollar and the Turkish lira slipping only 0.4 percent. 
""The market is unfortunately getting increasingly used to such events - it barely reacts to them anymore,"" said Commerzbank's Reichelt. ""When we had that attack in Berlin recently, there was barely any move - the euro moved a few pips.

The euro pushed higher in holiday thinned trade, with EUR/USD ending at 1.0517, up 0.29% for the day. The euro briefly jumped as high as 1.0653 during Asian trade, the strongest level in two weeks, before retracing gains.
The single currency ended the year down 3% against the dollar, its third consecutive yearly decline.
The pound was also higher, with GBP/USD advancing 0.71% to 1.2350 in late trade.
Sterling fell around 16% against the dollar for the year amid concerns over the economic fallout from the June 23 vote to exit the European Union.
The dollar was higher against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.34% at 116.95. On the year, the dollar posted its first yearly loss against the yen in five years, falling around 2.9%.

(Reuters) - Speculators raised net long bets on the U.S. dollar to $24.17 billion this week, increasing their positions from $22.45 billion last week, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and calculations by Reuters.
Net long bets on the dollar fell last week for the first time since October, but rebounded as currency speculators again took bullish positions on the future of the greenback in the last trading week of the year.
Analysts told Reuters they expect the dollar's strength to continue in 2017 with the greenback set to end this year up more than 3.5 percent against a basket of major currencies.
However, a good deal of uncertainty remained about what the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will bring and how much dollar appreciation it will tolerate.
""Much depends on how the Trump presidency and the Chinese economy work out,"" said Marshall Gittler, chief market analyst for retail broker FX Primus. ""In general, I expect the dollar to continue to gain.""
Speculators also raised net short contracts on the Japanese yen <JPY=> for the ninth straight week to 87,009 contracts, the most since August 2015.
Net short contracts on the euro <EUR=> were reduced substantially, with speculators holding the lowest number of net shorts on the continental currency since July.
The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

The euro traded at 1.0549 from $1.0556, though it earlier in the day traded at its highest level in nearly two weeks, due to computer trading. 
“Surpassing the $1.05 level triggered substantial algorithm orders,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital, in an investor note, obtained by Investing.com. “Thin holiday volumes aggravated the quake.”
The euro is down 2.9% in 2016 against the dollar.
Experts expect the currency to fall even more in the new year.
The ICE Dollar Index dropped 0.5% to 102.13 on Friday, leaving it on track for a 3.5% gain in 2016, its fourth straight year of advances.
The WSJ Dollar index which measures the greenback against a broader basket of rivals, dropped 0.3% to 92.73.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2016 10:58AM ET</span>",Dollar set for yearly gain despite brief euro surge,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was on track to notch a fourth straight year of gains against a basket of major currencies on Friday, despite briefly tumbling against the euro during the Asian trading session on thin liquidity. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was on track to gain 3.5 percent for the year, even as the euro briefly climbed nearly two full cents in overnight trading to $1.0651, its highest since Dec. 14.
The index has gained 4.3 percent since the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election on expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to boost fiscal stimulus would benefit the currency. The Federal Reserve's projections on Dec. 14 of three rate hikes for 2017 instead of the two foreseen in September have also contributed. 
Several analysts have said the dollar's uptrend remains intact next year, but they have not ruled out the risk of declines in the greenback, given their doubts surrounding how much dollar appreciation a Trump White House will tolerate.
""Much depends on how the Trump presidency and the Chinese economy work out,"" said Marshall Gittler, chief market analyst for retail broker FX Primus. ""In general, I expect the dollar to continue to gain.""
The dollar index was last off 0.62 percent at 102.040, down from a 14-year high of 103.65 hit on Dec. 20. The dollar was up 0.21 percent against the yen at 116.77 yen , but was set to post its first yearly loss in five years against the Japanese currency, of about 3 percent. 
Sterling, which has lost more than 16 percent of its value against the dollar to mark its worst year since 2008 on worries over Britain's June 24 ""Brexit"" vote to leave the European Union, was last up 0.82 percent  at $1.2368.
The euro was up 0.67 percent against the dollar at $1.0561, though down nearly a full cent from its session high. 
""The move is completely generated out of a New Year's Eve lack of liquidity,” said Jason Leinwand, founder and chief executive of FirstLine FX in Randolph, New Jersey. 

Other big losers this year against the dollar have been the Mexican peso <MXN=> and the Chinese yuan , which have lost 20.2 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2016 04:40AM ET</span>",China's yuan suffers biggest one-year loss since 1994,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's yuan strengthened against the dollar on Friday, but was on track for its biggest annual loss since 1994, which would make it the worst performing major Asian currency this year.
The yuan , which has reached an 8-1/2 year low, was on course to shed nearly 7 percent against the dollar in 2016.
Many market watchers expect the yuan to recoil further next year if President-elect Donald Trump's policies stoke stronger U.S. economic growth and higher interest rates.
UK-based Fathom Consulting said if globalization is thrown into reverse next year and China's dependence on exports is laid bare, ""its policymakers have little option but to quicken the pace at which they allow the renminbi (yuan) to appreciate.""
In 2016, the yuan has been pressured by worries about slowing Chinese economic growth and more recently by a resurgent U.S. dollar, which has spurred capital outflows from many emerging markets.
Prior to the market opening on Friday, the People's Bank of China set the yuan's midpoint rate for the day's trading  at 6.9370 per dollar, much firmer than Thursday's fix of 6.9497. 
GUIDANCE RATE
The stronger guidance rate came after a fall in the dollar on global markets. 
A gauge of dollar strength against six other currencies (DXY) fell to its weakest level in more than two weeks. The figure stood at 102.47 after touching a low of 101.99. 
On Friday, the spot yuan market opened at 6.9310 per dollar and settled at 6.9495 at 4:30 p.m.(0830 GMT), 57 pips firmer than the previous late session close and 0.18 percent softer than the midpoint. 
As of 0830 GMT, the yuan had lost 6.6 percent against the dollar on the year.
China takes the official market closing price at 4:30 p.m Shanghai time. (0830 GMT) into consideration when it fixes the official guidance rate, in an effort to let market forces play a bigger role in determining the yuan's value. The market also has an evening session lasting until 11:30 p.m.
MORE VOLATILITY?
A trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai said trade was calm on the year's last business day, but he saw more uncertainty ahead.
The yuan ""may be more volatile next year"" after changes to how a key index will be calculated, he said. 
While moves would still mostly depend on changes in the U.S. dollar, ""newly-added currencies like the South Korean won will create some noise,"" the trader predicted.
Late on Thursday, China announced a near-doubling of the number of foreign currencies in the basket used to set the yuan's value.
The U.S. dollar's weight will be reduced to 22.4 percent from 26.4 percent and the euro's to 16.34 percent from 21.39 percent, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) said. 
Traders noted that authorities adopted a different approach toward the yuan at the end of this year.
""The central bank was more inclined to release depreciation pressure on the yuan this time last year, when they loosened their grip on the spot rate and let the currency weaken to elevate the dollar purchase cost for those who want to swap yuan for dollars at the beginning of the next year,"" said one trader at a Chinese bank. 
""But this time, authorities want to stabilize the currency as they are afraid of triggering stronger expectations of depreciation,"" he said.
China's authorities have rolled out policies over the past two months to tighten its grip on capital outflows after a slide in the yuan, which was down to hit 8-1/2 year lows. 
The offshore yuan was trading 0.37 percent weaker than the onshore spot at 6.9755 per dollar. 
Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs), considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan's value, traded at 7.3185, 5.21 percent weaker than the midpoint.
One-year NDFs are settled against the midpoint, not the spot rate.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2016 11:11AM ET</span>","Dollar falls against yen on U.S. yield drop, profit-taking","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a 15-day low against the yen on Thursday as traders used the quiet holiday period to take profits on the dollar's recent gains, while a drop in U.S. Treasury yields on waning risk appetite reduced the greenback's appeal.
The dollar was last down 0.57 percent against the yen  at 116.57 yen after falling as much as 0.9 percent in early trading to 116.23 yen, its lowest level since Dec. 14. The greenback had gained 11.5 percent against the Japanese currency between the Nov. 8 U.S. election and Wednesday.
Those gains came partly as U.S. Treasury yields surged to multi-month and multi-year peaks on a faster projected pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases next year and expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies would boost inflation. 
Yields on most U.S. Treasuries hit at least two-week lows on Thursday, however, halting the dollar's gains by reducing the appeal of higher-yielding U.S. assets compared to those of other countries. 
""It’s profit-taking,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. ""The strong dollar that we’ve seen since the start of November seems to be in a toppish environment."" He also noted that trading remained thin during the holiday period. 
The euro was last up 0.6 percent <EUR=> against the dollar at $1.0472 after touching a one-week high of $1.0480 in early trading, but was still on track to fall 3.6 percent against the dollar this year. 
Data on Wednesday showing contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell in November to their lowest level in nearly a year contributed to the dollar's weakness, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group.
""The dollar fall was mostly due to renewed doubts about the U.S. recovery after pending home sales dropped in November. This is where the risk-off reversal started,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.49 percent at 102.790 after touching 103.630 on Wednesday and flirting with a 14-year high of 103.650 touched on Dec. 20.
The index has gained 4.2 percent this year, with all those gains having come after the November U.S. election.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2016 08:57AM ET</span>","China expands CFETS index basket, yuan seen weakening vs. dollar","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will change the way it calculates a key yuan index in the new year, nearly doubling the number of foreign currencies in a basket that is used to set the yuan's value, its foreign exchange market operator said on Thursday.
The central bank, which oversees the market operator, has been trying to reform the way it manages the yuan by making it more market-driven and transparent.
Starting on Jan. 1, the number of currencies in the CFETS basket will be increased to 24 from 13, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) said in a statement on its website.
The change is aimed at improving the mechanism generating the CFETS RMB Index <.CFSCNYI> and making the CFETS basket more representative, it said.
China has been promoting use of the index, partly to divert attention from the yuan's value against the dollar  which has fallen almost 7 percent this year and is near its lowest in 8-1/2 years.
The trade-weighted CFETS RMB index, which was unveiled in December 2015, fell 5.8 percent between the end of 2015 and Dec. 23 this year. 
The yuan index has been steady since early October, while the currency has been losing ground versus a broadly strengthening dollar.
Analysts said the change was in line with the central bank's bid to discourage investors from exclusively tracking the yuan's fluctuations, but it would have limited impact on the Chinese currency, which is expected to weaken further against the dollar in 2017.
""This means that the central bank will pay more attention to the RMB's stability against a basket of currencies,"" analysts at CEBM Group said in a note.
""If the dollar strengthens sharply, weakening in the yuan will be inevitable.""
The yuan is also known as renminbi, or RMB.
The 11 currencies to be added, including the Korean won, the South African rand and the Mexican peso, will have a 21.09 percent weighting in the basket, which the CFETS said would basically cover the currencies of China's major trading partners.
The dollar's weight will be reduced to 22.4 percent from 26.4 percent and the euro's to 16.34 percent from 21.39 percent, the CFETS said in its statement.

It said it would adjust the composition and weighting of its currency basket annually.

Elsewhere, the British pound rebounded 0.25% to 1.2258 against the dollar, after falling to a two-month low of 1.2201 a day earlier.
The greenback slumped after data from the National Association of Realtors’ showed U.S. pending home sales dropped to the lowest level in almost a year in November, a sign the property market could be losing steam.
Since the U.S. election in early November, the dollar has rallied by almost 6% thanks to bets of higher U.S. growth and a faster pace of interest rate increases under incoming president Donald Trump.
The Fed hiked interest rates for the first time in a year earlier this month and projected three more increases in 2017. In contrast, central banks in Europe and Japan remain committed to very loose monetary policies

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Wednesday on expectations for stronger U.S. economic growth, while stocks fell broadly as home resales dropped sharply.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined, but worries in Europe about rescue plans for shaky Italian banks drove the spread between the benchmark and 10-year German Bund yields to the widest ever.
On Wall Street, shares fell across the board with the S&P 500 posting its largest daily drop since Oct. 11.
Data showed contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell in November to their lowest level in nearly a year, a sign that rising interest rates could be weighing on the housing market.
""There was enough bad news during the day"" to pull the market lower, said Keith Bliss, senior vice-president at Cuttone & Co in New York referring to the housing data.
He said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's comments that Israel's building of settlements on occupied land was endangering Middle East peace made some traders nervous and exacerbated the decline.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 111.36 points, or 0.56 percent, to 19,833.68, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 18.96 points, or 0.84 percent, to 2,249.92 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 48.89 points, or 0.89 percent, to 5,438.56.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) edged up 0.33 percent, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) fell 0.44 percent.
Emerging market stocks rose 0.77 percent.
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.5 percent while Japan's Nikkei (N225) closed little changed.
The dollar (DXY) rose on continued bets that the Federal Reserve will have to raise rates next year to keep up with inflation and growth brought by a planned fiscal stimulus from the incoming Trump administration.
""This is just a continuation of the trend"" of dollar strength, said Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer of Palo Alto, California-based Merk Investments.
""People are trying to be aligned with the winning positions.""
The dollar index (DXY) gained 0.23 percent. The euro fell 0.43 percent to $1.041 and the British pound dropped 0.39 percent to $1.2222.
Euro zone bond yields fell across the board as concerns about the strength of a rescue plan for Italian banks and normal year-end caution pushed investors to the safety of government debt. 
Germany's 10-year yields  hit their lowest in seven weeks at 0.181 percent. That in turn widened the yield gap to U.S. Treasuries, which act as the world's benchmark borrowing rate. The spread was last at 235.25 basis points.
Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels in two weeks, however, after a well-bid 5-year note auction enticed buyers into U.S. government debt.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a session low at 2.503 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 15/32 in price to yield 2.5099 percent.
Oil prices edged up at settlement for a fourth consecutive session, edging close to their highest levels in 1-1/2 years, but they turned negative in post-settlement trade after API data showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. 
A looming supply cut from many major producers is expected to give crude prices support.
U.S. crude (CLc1) last fell 0.4 percent to $53.67 a barrel and Brent (LCOc1) traded at $55.95, down 0.3 percent on the day.
Oil has surged about 50 percent in 2016 even after plunging in January to its lowest in more than a decade.

""But some irresponsible media reported that the onshore rate of the yuan broke the psychological threshold of 7.0000,"" the central bank said. 
Persistent downward pressure on the yuan has contributed to large capital outflows this year and the central bank has spent some of its foreign exchange reserves to support the currency's value.

The spot yuan is on track to finish the year with a loss of nearly 7 percent against the dollar, and traders expect depreciation pressure to extend into 2017.

Trading volumes are expected to remain light this week due to the holiday period as many investors already closed books before the end of the year, reducing liquidity in the market, which could result in exaggerated market moves.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday on stronger-than-expected U.S. housing data and expectations for a hawkish Federal Reserve, but remained below a recent 10-month high in thin holiday trading. 
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.6 percent in October from a revised 0.5 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis. This outpaced expectations of economists polled by Reuters for a 0.5 percent increase.
The data helped underscore expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates at a faster pace next year, a view that gained traction after the Fed on Dec. 14 projected three rate hikes next year, up from the two foreseen in September. The data also sent U.S. Treasury yields higher. 
Trading was thin as markets in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Hong Kong were closed for holidays. 
""The prospect of Fed tightening next year is keeping bonds under pressure, yields up and the dollar bid, and obviously the Case-Shiller data is helping that,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.
The dollar extended its gains to a fresh session high against the yen of 117.60 yen , putting it up about 0.4 percent against the Japanese currency on the day, in the wake of data showing U.S. consumer confidence hit its highest in more than 15 years in December.
The dollar remained below a 10-month high of 118.66 yen touched Dec. 15 and a 14-year high against a basket of major currencies touched Dec. 20. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up just 0.06 percent at 103.070, below the 14-year peak of 103.650.
Analysts said the dollar's uptrend looked intact, even as 120 yen and parity with the euro remained out of reach for the greenback on Tuesday. 
""The dollar has been and is likely to continue to be supported by expectations that a new administration in Washington is going to be inflationary and thus, force the Fed to raise U.S. borrowing costs at a faster pace in 2017,"" Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, in a research note. 

Sterling was last down 0.34 percent  against the dollar at $1.2255, with analysts attributing the drop to concerns over next year's Brexit negotiations. The euro  was last mostly flat against the greenback at $1.0457.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2016 12:10PM ET</span>",Iran's currency hits record low as Trump worries deter fund inflows,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran's rial hit a record low against the U.S. dollar on Monday in a sign of concern about the country's ability to attract foreign money after U.S. president-elect Donald Trump takes office.
The rial was quoted in the free market at 41,500 to the dollar, weakening from around 41,250 on Sunday and 35,570 in mid-September. Before this month, the record low was about 40,000, hit in late 2012, traders said.
Economists said there were several reasons for the slide, including the dollar's strength against many currencies in the last few weeks, and uncertainty before next year's presidential elections in Iran.
But they said Trump's election in November was a major factor. He has said he will scrap the deal between Iran and world powers that imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear projects and lifted sanctions on the Iranian economy in January this year.
This would hinder Tehran's efforts to attract tens of billions of dollars of foreign funds to help modernize its economy. Inflows since January have been smaller than the government expected, partly because big international banks fear running into U.S. legal trouble if they deal with Iran.
Many analysts think Washington will stop short of abolishing the deal, but it may apply remaining sanctions on Tehran more stringently. At the very least, uncertainty over Washington's intentions could make companies around the world more cautious about trading with or investing in Iran. 
""The inflow of foreign currency to the country is not as much as the government expected after the nuclear deal,"" Bijan Bidabad, an Iranian economist, told Reuters in a telephone interview from Tehran. 
At the same time, pro-growth policies in Iran have boosted money supply. ""This has changed the proportion between the local currency and foreign currency, increasing the exchange rate.""
Iranian officials have denied any link between the U.S. election result and the rial's slide. Samad Karimi, head of the exports department at the central bank, blamed the slide on a temporary surge in demand for dollars for travel and trade at the end of the year, state news agency IRNA reported.
Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Monday that the rial's drop was due to “psychological issues"" and that the government hoped it would rebound within days.
Nevertheless, traders at some exchange houses in Tehran told Reuters they had not seen a sudden rise of dollar demand in recent weeks - suggesting the reasons for the rial's tumble might be deep-seated.
If it continues, the rial's weakness could become a political issue ahead of next year's Iranian elections by threatening some of the economic achievements of President Hassan Rouhani, who took power in 2013.
Rouhani's administration stabilized the currency after years of volatility, which helped bring inflation down to single-digit rates from above 40 percent.

Besides the free market exchange rate, Iran uses an official rate, now at 32,317, for some state transactions. The widening gap between the official and free rates has sucked hard currency out of the formal banking system; in an effort to counteract this, the government authorized some banks on Saturday to trade at free rates.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2016 02:46PM ET</span>","Dollar little changed in light, pre-Christmas trade","By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar held steady on Friday in a tight trading range, as traders moved to the sidelines ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend, leaving the greenback about half a percent below a 14-year peak set earlier this week.
The dollar will likely resume its recent rally when the new year begins. It has gained 5 percent against a basket of currencies since Donald Trump's U.S. presidential victory on Nov. 8.
""No one wants to take additional risk between now and the end of the year. They don't want to jeopardize those gains,"" said Stan Shipley, strategist at Evercore ISI in New York.
Traders brushed off upbeat data on U.S. new home sales and consumer sentiment, which reinforced views that the world's biggest economy is expanding at a steady clip.
Bets that Trump's economic policies would promote faster U.S. growth and inflation have fed appetite for the dollar, stocks and corporate bonds, while stoking selling in traditional safe havens the yen, gold and U.S. Treasuries.
The Federal Reserve's hint that it might raise U.S. interest rates at a faster pace in 2017, along with the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan's maintaining their ultra-loose policy stance, has also bolstered the dollar in recent days.
The dollar index (DXY) was marginally softer at 103.04 after trading in a 0.34 point range, and not far from the 14-year peak of 103.65 reached on Tuesday.
The euro was steady after the Italian government approved a rescue package for Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) after the world's oldest bank failed to raise needed capital from investors.
Worries about the European bank sector also diminished after  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)  agreed to settle with the U.S. Department of Justice over claims they misled investors when selling mortgage-backed securities. [nL5N1EI1PL] 
The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.0446 , holding above a nearly 14-year low of $1.0350 set earlier in the week. 
With Japan markets closed for a holiday, the yen edged up 0.1 percent against the euro (EURJPY=) at 122.45 yen and up 0.2 percent versus the dollar  at 117.26 yen.
""For the yen, there's a bit of consolidation after its recent weakening,"" said Paul Christopher, head global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. 
The yen recovered somewhat after hitting a 10-1/2-month low against the dollar this week, helped by lower U.S. yields and safe-haven bids stemming from the attacks in Ankara and Berlin, analysts said.

The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) was down 1 basis point from Thursday, at 2.543 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar declined against a basket of currencies on Thursday, pulling further away from the 14-year high it set earlier this week as traders booked profits and brushed off mostly upbeat U.S. economic data.

The dollar posted a series of multiyear highs after the U.S. Federal Reserve's hint last week that it might raise interest rates up to three times in 2017, which was one more than what some traders had expected.
The dollar rally that started six weeks ago has been underpinned by bets that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would slash taxes and boost federal spending, resulting in higher growth and inflation.
As they awaited details on economic policies from the Trump administration, traders and analysts cautioned that the dollar, which has risen 5 percent on an index basis since Nov. 8, was vulnerable to a further pullback. 
Still most of them have not changed their longer-term positive view of the U.S. currency.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2016 06:39AM ET</span>","Dollar retreats from 14-year high, Swedish crown has best day in six months","By Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar took a breather on Wednesday after reaching a 14-year high the previous day, while the Swedish crown chalked up its biggest rise in six months after the Riksbank voted to ease policy further only by the narrowest of margins. 
Sweden's central bank kept interest rates on hold at -0.50 percent and extended its bond-buying program after a split board forced Governor Stefan Ingves to use his casting vote for the first time since 2008.
The crown rose to its highest in more than two months against the euro.
The dollar drifted lower, meanwhile, giving back some of the ground gained since the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The greenback has chalked up all its 4.5 percent gains for the year since the election, as traders have bet that Donald Trump's administration will go on a growth-boosting tax cut and fiscal spending spree.
With no major economic data or policymaker speeches scheduled and the Christmas holiday approaching, the euro dragged itself from Tuesday's 14-year low back above $1.04.
The biggest mover was the Swedish crown. With central bank stimulus, housing debt and private sector borrowing all looking stretched, according to many economists, foreign exchange traders bet on this being the beginning of the end of QE.
""This one is probably the last QE extension, in our view,"" said Daniele Antonucci, economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). ""Stimulus, monetary and fiscal, is unlikely to be extended much further.""
At 1115 GMT the euro was down 0.7 percent against the crown, below 9.64 crowns (EURSEK=) for the first time since October 11 and marking its biggest one-day fall since June 20. 
The euro was up 0.2 percent on the day against the dollar, however, at $1.0405 , rebounding from as low as $1.0352 on Tuesday, a level last seen in January 2003.
Traders are casting a wary eye on Italy's troubled bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS), which needs to raise 5 billion euros by the end of the year to avoid being wound up by the European Central Bank.
And dollar bulls say the greenback could resume its climb later in the day if the Dow Jones Industrials Average hits the psychological 20,000 level (DJI).
""The euro is in a fight between short-covering pressure and political angst. Economics doesn't come into it at all. If Dow 20,000 is just a number but a magnet all the same, euro parity with the dollar will be every bit as magnetic,"" said Kit Juckes at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). 
""We'll get there and get over-excited before too long.""
The dollar was down 0.3 percent against the Japanese yen at 117.50 yen , down more than one yen from its 10 1/2-month high of 118.66 touched on Dec 15.
The dollar's trade-weighted index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY), <=USD> fell 0.2 percent to 103.11. On Tuesday it hit a 14-year high of 103.65.
U.S. Treasury yields slipped on Wednesday. The 10-year yield was down a basis point on the day at 2.55 percent (US10YT=RR), and almost 10 basis points off last week's two-year peak.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a fresh 14-year high on Tuesday, boosted by upbeat comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that kept alive market expectations for swifter U.S. interest rate hikes next year than had been expected.
The greenback climbed broadly but its gains were strongest against the yen, which slid as much as 1 percent after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged . 
On Monday the yen had surged along with fellow safe-haven the Swiss franc after deadly incidents in Turkey and Germany.
Both currencies have since given up those gains.
Yellen said late on Monday that the U.S. labor market had improved to its strongest in almost a decade, suggesting wage growth is picking up.
The Fed chair did not mention monetary policy, but some analysts said the fact that she did not pour cold water on investors' moves to price in a possible three rate hikes in 2017 after the Fed's policy statement and rate rise last week was a catalyst for dollar strength.
""She didn't use the opportunity to take the market back from being overly hawkish,"" said UBS currency strategist Constantin Bolz, in Zurich. ""Maybe there were some people who...thought they would hold off from further dollar longs until she spoke, in case she were to row back.""
The dollar rose almost half a percent against a basket of major currencies to 103.65 (DXY), its strongest since January 2003.
The euro fell half a percent to $1.0352 , once again opening up the door to a move to parity with the dollar. 
The greenback was also within sight of a 10-1/2-month high of 118.66 yen touched last week, at 118.24 yen.
Expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration will go ahead with tax cuts and fiscal spending, leading to higher U.S. growth and inflation, have lifted U.S. bond yields and the dollar in the past six weeks, in what has become known as the Trumpflation trade. 
""The market is still playing this prospect of (policy) normalization and, as long as this is the case, the dollar will remain strong or even appreciate a little further,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen, in Frankfurt. 
Analysts said the yen was the most obvious play against the dollar in the Trumpflation trade because the Bank of Japan is the central bank that looks furthest away from normalizing its policy settings.
The BOJ on Tuesday affirmed its twin targets of minus 0.10 percent interest on some excess reserves and a zero percent 10-year government bond yield.

The euro was down 0.42% at 1.0358 against the dollar by 7:50AM ET (12:50GMT). It fell to 1.0352 earlier, the weakest level since January 2003, as investors digested news of two separate deadly incidents in Turkey and Germany.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.5% at 103.59 in early trade, a level not seen since December 2002.
Optimistic remarks on the U.S. labor market by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen strengthened the possibility of further rate hikes next year.
Speaking at the University of Baltimore’s midyear commencement ceremony Monday, Yellen said recent improvements in the economy have created one of the strongest job markets in years for graduates.
The speech came a few days after the U.S. central bank hiked interest rates for the first time in a year and projected three more increases in 2017, up from the two projected in September.
Elsewhere, the dollar climbed 0.85% to 118.12 against the yen, within sight of a 10-1/2-month high of 118.66, as fresh buying emerged after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged at its final meeting of the year on Tuesday.
The BOJ affirmed its twin targets of minus 0.10% interest on some excess reserves and the 0.0% 10-year government bond yield. The central bank also raised its assessment of the economy for the first time since May 2015, noting that “exports have picked up.”

But the killing of Russia's ambassador to Turkey jumbled the market for the rest of the day.
The greenback was down against the USD/JPY, at 0.64%, 117.22, and was down against the GBP/USD by 0.66% to 1.2404 and against the EUR/USD, by 0.24%, at 1.0422, on intraday trading.
But the dollar/euro pairing settled up, 0.2%, and closed the day at 1.0403. The dollar/yen pairing also was up a bit at the end of the day, 0.14%, closing at 11722.
The dollar/pound pairing stayed down for the day, settling 0.2% lower, at 1.2393.
The shooting of the ambassador, believed to be by a jihadi, jolted the markets with the spectre of international terrorism once again.
But the Fed remarks from earlier remained in the mix in the mind's of market makers.
Fed studies shows that those who enter the workforce during a strong economy are more likely to find a good job, stay employed, and earn a consistently higher salary, the Fed chairwoman said.
“After years of a slow economic recovery, you are entering the strongest job market in nearly a decade,” Yellen said in a brief commencement address that did not attempt to tackle policy questions facing the U.S. central bank.
Yellen said new graduates have now “done the one thing” that is most important to a successful working life: earning the degrees they are receiving.
“Economists are not certain about many things. But we are quite certain that a college degree are more likely to find a job, keep a job, have higher job satisfaction and earn a higher salary,” Yellen said.
College graduates’ annual earnings were, on average, 70% higher than those with only a high-school diploma.
This gap was only 20% in 1980.
Technology and globalization are two important factors driving the differentiation.
In her speech, Yellen said signs of a healthy job market ""abound,"" including steady job creation, low layoff rate and more openings for new jobs."
188,By Business Insider,"<span>Dec 19, 2016 10:09AM ET</span>",The Japanese yen is climbing,"The Japanese yen is climbing.
The currency is up by 0.6% at 117.2330 per dollar as of 7:53 a.m. ET.
Still, the yen has weakened by about 10% against the dollar since the election of Donald Trump in November.
Earlier, data from Japan's Ministry of Finance showed the country's trade surplus narrowed to 152.5 billion yen in November, down from 496.2 billion yen reported in October, as both imports and exports showed improvement.
""The sharp weakening of the yen has contributed to a rebound in the annual growth rate of trade values,"" Marcel Theiliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, wrote. ""However, since imports are invoiced in foreign currency more often than exports, the trade surplus should start to narrow in coming months.""
He continued:
""For as start, 75% of all imports are invoiced in foreign currency but only 64% of all exports. Any weakening of the exchange rate therefore lifts the yen-value of imports by more than the yen-value of exports. What’s more, we expect import volumes to rebound next year. Finally, we forecast a rise in the price of Brent crude oil from $55 today to $60 by the end of next year, which will lift the import bill further.""

189,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2016 06:53AM ET</span>",'Trumpflation' trade keeps dollar near 14-year highs,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied close to its highest levels in 14 years on Monday, underpinned by expectations that a fiscal expansion planned by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will boost inflation and lead to a faster pace of interest rates hikes. 
The greenback surged to its highest since January 2003 against a basket of currencies (DXY) last week and threatened parity with the euro , after the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted that rates could rise as many as three times next year.
But the dollar drifted a little on Friday and, at 102.88 on Monday, was around 0.7 percent below Thursday's peak of 103.56, with investors booking profits and lightening hefty bets on the currency as a two-week holiday period began, meaning thin liquidity.
""The strength we've had post Trump's election could fade a little into the end of the year. People just close down some of their long positions on the dollar,"" said HSBC currency strategist Dominic Bunning, in London. 
""Does the market still believe in the Trumpflation story? Does it still believe Trump is going to deliver fiscal loosening, with infrastructure spending, tax cuts etc? At the moment there's been nothing to change that view.""
Citi's head of G10 currency strategy in London, Richard Cochinos, said a speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen due at 1830 GMT would be watched for any hint that last week's Fed meeting was interpreted by markets as more hawkish than had been intended. 
Against the yen, the dollar fell as much as 0.9 percent, before recovering a touch to trade down half a percent on the day by 1140 GMT at 117.27 yen . The yen was boosted by data showing Japan's export performance improved strongly in November.
Data released on Friday showed dollar net long positions were little changed in the week to Dec. 13, affirming a trend in place since the Trump's election victory on Nov. 8. Net shorts on the yen rose to their largest since early December last year. [IMM/FX]
The Bank of Japan kicked off a two-day policy meeting on Monday, at which it is expected to maintain its 10-year government bond yield target as the weaker yen helps Japan's economic prospects, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
""The speed of the yen's weakening was likely much faster than the BOJ anticipated,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo.
""While no major changes are expected from the meeting, some tweaks to policy are possible, to adjust to the new market situation,"" she said.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2016 06:40PM ET</span>","As yuan weakens, Chinese rush to open foreign currency accounts","By Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Zhang Yuting lives and works in Shanghai, has only visited the United States once, and rarely needs to use foreign currency. But that hasn’t stopped the 29-year-old accountant from putting a slice of her bank savings into the greenback.
She is not alone. In the first 11 months of 2016, official figures show that foreign currency bank deposits owned by Chinese households rose by almost 32 percent, propelled by the yuan's recent fall to eight-year lows against the dollar.
The rapid rise - almost four times the growth rate for total deposits in the yuan and other currencies as recorded in central bank data – comes at a time when the yuan is under intense pressure from capital outflows. The outflows are partially a result of concerns that the yuan is going to weaken further as U.S. interest rates rise, and because of lingering concerns about the health of the Chinese economy. 
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to declare China a currency manipulator and to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports into the U.S., as well as tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea, have only added to the fears.
“Expectations of capital flight are clear,"" said Zhang, who used her yuan savings to buy $10,000 this year. ""I might exchange more yuan early next year, as long as I've got money.""
Household foreign currency deposits in China are not huge compared to the money that companies, banks and wealthy individuals have been directing into foreign currency accounts and other assets offshore. All up, households had $118.72 billion of foreign money in their bank accounts at the end of November, while total foreign currency deposits were $702.56 billion.
But the high growth rate in the household forex holdings are symbolic of a growing headache for the government as it struggles to counter the yuan's weakness.
Since October, the government has acted to slow outflows by tightening existing measures, such as approvals for foreign currency transfers, and has leant on banks to be stricter, making it harder for companies and individuals to change money and transfer money abroad. 
More measures may be in the cards.
On Wednesday, a group of central bank advisers signaled their readiness to defend the yuan and said depreciation pressures would ease as the economy stabilized.
This has all started to have an impact at local bank branch level. Individuals are permitted by current law to convert the equivalent of $50,000 a year into foreign currency but according to some bankers they are taking steps to try to slow the flow in the current environment.
Two banking executives said some banks were threatening to put people who changed the daily maximum of $10,000 on consecutive days on blacklists. A person who is blacklisted may be from changing money for a period of time, one said.
Banks under pressure to minimize outflows are also offering deals and giveaways for people who voluntarily convert their forex savings back into yuan. Bank of Communications is entering any customer who changes more than $1,000 into yuan the chance to be part of a lucky draw, with various prizes, such as portable printers. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) on its website offers preferential exchange rates for dollar-to-yuan transactions.
""We're not seeing capital flight or lack of confidence in the local currency,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ. But, he added, ""the more you see people converting, reflected in foreign currency deposits in the banking segment, it means obviously there's pressure on the local currency.""
DIVERSIFYING AWAY
In November, households added a net $5.65 billion to onshore foreign currency deposits, which was more than a quarter of the total increase, which includes deposits by companies, central bank data showed.
The deputy head of a district branch of one of China's biggest banks said she'd noticed an uptick in ordinary people shifting money from yuan into dollar accounts. ""Everyone's following the trend,"" she said.
The biggest monthly rise in the foreign currency account deposits so far this year came in January, when the annual $50,000 conversion quota was reset and individuals rushed to change yuan into dollars.
While foreign currency deposits are a type of capital outflow, Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said they were preferable to money actually leaving the country.
""Regulators have a lot of control over what happens to those deposits, and they can control the rate of inflows into onshore FX deposits,"" he said.

Zhang, the accountant, has withdrawn her dollars in cash, concerned that a further fall in the yuan could lead to tougher measures from the state, such as forcing her to sell dollars in a bank account. There is no indication the government is considering anything of that nature.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2016 04:12AM ET</span>",Battered euro and yen recover after dollar surge,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro, yen and pound all recovered some ground against the dollar on Friday after slides of up to 3 percent in reaction to the Federal Reserve outlook for U.S. interest rates next year.
Markets had headed into the Fed meeting on Wednesday expecting little chances of another surge in the dollar before the end of the year. 
But instead, the upping of predictions for the number of interest rate rises next year brought parity with the euro back into play and took losses for the yen from its peak on U.S. election night in November to just over 17 percent.
Both were trading 0.2-0.3 percent higher on the day on Friday at $1.0438  and 118.37 yen per dollar , respectively
""It's Friday and we have had a busy week. I would be surprised to see the euro pushed below $1.04 today,"" said Niels Christensen, a strategist with Nordea in Copenhagen. ""I still think the risk is to the downside. But from here we move into year end. The market will be less liquid.""
Many banks' forecasts for the major developed currencies have been blown out of the water by the moves of the past 36 hours. Only 10 of more than 50 polled by Reuters earlier this month forecast the dollar reaching parity with the euro within the next 12 months. On Thursday that threshold was just over 3 percent away. 
But given the scale of the moves in the past month, driven on by volatility around last week's European Central Bank meeting and the Italian constitutional referendum, many players may now be content to walk away until January. 
One risk to that scenario is a squeeze on dollar liquidity around the year-end. The one-year cost of dollar funding for European banks - called cross currency basis swaps - is back within sight of 4-year highs hit at the end of November. 
""I'm going to be watching the year-end very closely,"" said the head of trading at one large international bank in London. ""If it gets much worse it may create more of the sort of pressure we saw on the dollar earlier this year.""
Nordea's Christensen also pointed to the risk, highlighted by October's 10-percent ""flash crash"" in sterling, that a large order could move prices sharply as trading volumes fall over the Christmas holiday.
The dollar was up another 0.2 percent against both its New Zealand and Australian   equivalents and the Chinese yuan.   

With a weaker renminbi one of the big calls of many international banks for the next year, all eyes are on how much more weakness Beijing will tolerate, a year after a speculative run on the offshore version of the currency.

The Communist Party's official paper, the People's Daily, said in an editorial on Friday that there was ""no need to worry too much"" over whether the rate hikes would put further depreciation pressure on the yuan and increase capital outflows. 
""The days of 'when the United States sneezes, the whole world is cold' have drifted away, liquidity in today's global markets is no longer all in US dollars,"" the newspaper said.
""The supply of dollars will be tightened on the market but everyone has many choices such as the relatively loose euro to deal with the dollar tightening in order to ease the rate hike's impact on the stability of the financial system,"" it said. 
China's yuan  fell to its weakest level in more than eight years against a broadly stronger U.S. dollar on Thursday in the wake of the policy decision by the Fed, which also signaled a faster pace of rate hikes.
Analysts have predicted that the yuan could be set for further falls as authorities have struggled to defend the currency against a relentlessly rising dollar amid heavy capital outflows. 
The newspaper said that the international community had grown more optimistic about China's growth prospects after recent strong economic data. 

""In the short term devaluation pressure on the yuan does exist, but in the long run, economic fundamentals decide the direction of the yuan exchange rate,"" it said.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 11:20AM ET</span>",The euro's return to parity with the dollar,"By Patrick Graham and Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar's worldwide surge on higher U.S. interest rates has dragged the euro below $1.04 , removing the last big chart-based hurdle to a return to parity for the first time since the single currency was launched in physical form in 2002. 
As the attached graphic shows, the euro has lost more than 7 percent against the dollar in the last three months, 25 percent since May 2014, and 35 percent from all-time peaks hit before the financial crisis in 2008. 
(For the graphic on the history of euro click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/1/1549/1549/EURPARITY.png )
That is largely the result of a yawning gap in interest rates on either side of the Atlantic which reflects the contrasting economic fortunes of the world's two biggest developed regions since 2008.
Worried by poor growth, the European Central Bank has been playing for a weaker currency with further rounds of money-printing at a time when its U.S. equivalent has begun to raise interest rates and suck dollars out of the system. 
Having benefited from swift moves to recapitalise banks in 2008, the gains against the single currency are also the latest arm of a surge in the dollar which could crimp any recovery in U.S. exports on global markets.
The fall in the currency's value helps European producers but reduces the purchasing power of euro zone consumers while increasing the cost of dollar-priced goods and vital commodities like oil, iron and steel. 
Regulators also worry further dollar strength may destabilize the global financial system and some of the large emerging economies where companies have borrowed heavily in dollars. 

A number of large banks and asset managers have forecast a move past parity, but only 10 of more than 50 economists in Reuters latest polling predicted a fall below 1 euro per dollar - a reflection both of the speed of moves since Donald Trump's election and doubts over whether parity will be achieved.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar surged to its highest levels in 14 years on Thursday, after the Federal Reserve hinted that U.S. interest rates could rise faster in 2017 than investors had been anticipating, and hiked rates for the first time in a year. 
The 25-basis point increase in the central bank's benchmark interest rate had been widely expected by financial markets; it was its signal that rates were likely to rise three times in 2017 - up from twice at the Fed's September meeting - that investors latched onto and drove the greenback higher. http://tmsnrt.rs/2gsUVwB
The Fed's policy meeting was the first since the U.S. election victory of Donald Trump, who investors expect to drive up inflation and boost growth with a program of huge fiscal expansion. 
The dollar jumped after the Fed statement late on Wednesday and built on those gains on Thursday, climbing as much as 0.8 percent against a basket of major peers to hit 102.62 (DXY), its highest since early 2003, as U.S. Treasury yields surged.
At least five of 17 Fed policymakers appeared to have boosted their interest rate outlook since September, according to the new ""dot plot"" of rate projections. But not all traders and analysts viewed the Fed's statement as hawkish. 
""The macroeconomic forecast is unchanged...and the dots have shifted only very slightly – the median dots went up by 25 basis points but the average only went up 6 basis points,"" said UBS Wealth Management's head of currency strategy, Thomas Flury, in Zurich.
""Yellen pointed out that uncertainties are exceptionally high, and we know that when uncertainties are high the Fed is more moderate than hawkish. So from the Fed's perspective the communication was fairly neutral."" 
Against the yen, the dollar jumped as much as 0.7 percent on the day to hit 117.87 <JPY=>, its strongest since February. 
Analysts said Japan might now step up verbal warnings against excessive yen declines versus the dollar. 
The dollar is on track for easily its strongest quarter against the Japanese currency in over 20 years, after a more than 16 percent climb since the start of October. 
""I doubt that Fed can actually raise interest rates three times next year. Last year they planned to have four rate hikes, but ended up raising only once,"" said Daisuke Karakama, chief market economist at Mizuho Bank in Tokyo.
The allure of higher U.S. yields took a toll on emerging Asian currencies, with the Chinese yuan  hitting its lowest levels in more than eight years.
The euro hit a 21-month low of $1.0468, close to its 2015 low of $1.0457 - the weakest since 2003. 
The Norwegian crown surged 0.6 percent to 8.9715 crowns per euro (EURNOK=D4) after the country's central bank marginally raised its prediction for borrowing costs in 2019.

""But I want to emphasize that the shifts that you see here are really very tiny,"" Yellen said.
She added that While the labor market remains solid, the Fed was ""not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.""

226,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2016 08:10PM ET</span>","Dollar takes breather, investors anxious about Fed rates outlook","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar took a breather on Wednesday as investors looked to whether the Federal Reserve will signal any acceleration in the pace of future rate increases to deal with an expected ramp-up in fiscal spending under President-elect Donald Trump. 
In its policy meeting ending later in the day, the Fed is all but certain to raise its interest rate target by 0.25 percentage point to 0.50-0.75 percent, which would be just the second rate hike since the financial crisis in 2007-08, following the tightening last December. 
""The markets think a rate hike is a certainty so the focus is on the outlook for next year. I think they will maintain their previous projections to raise rates twice next year but if they turn more hawkish, the dollar will test its upside again,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, chief FX strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) <=USD> stabilized around 101.05 in early Asian trade, having slipped from 101.78 touched early on Monday.
The euro  traded little changed at $1.0628, off Monday's one-week low of $1.0525.
Against the yen, the dollar  traded at 115.20 yen, backing off a tad from Monday's 10-month peak of 116.12 yen.
Some players were eager to take profits from the dollar's massive rally of about 10 percent against the yen since the Nov 8 U.S. election. 
Expectations that Trump will cut taxes, boost fiscal spending and raise U.S. growth over the near-term lifted U.S. bond yields and stock prices, making the dollar more attractive.
Inflation is also likely to heat up if Trump moves to implement his more controversial campaign promises, such as deporting illegal immigrants and slapping tariffs, further boosting U.S. bond yields.
Although many investors had long thought the Fed will raise rates very slowly and cautiously, especially under dovish Chair Janet Yellen, Trump's surprise election victory last month has drastically shaken up that assumption.
The two-year U.S. debt yield rose to a 6 1/2-year high on Tuesday and U.S. money market futures <0#FF:> are pricing in almost two rate hikes next year.

But a bit of a retreat on aggressive tax cut plans,articulated by Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) dampened enthusiasm for the dollar. McConnell said that President-elect Trump's income tax cuts had to be ""revenue neutral,"" e.g. not impact the deficit. That has economists worried that the huge benefits expected by slashed taxes will not arrive, as promised, by Trump during the election and the transition.
""Mitch McConnell is focusing on infrastructure spending. He doesn't want it to be like Obama's stimulus,"" said Art Laffer, an economist who advised President Reagan, from the White House Economic Council, on Tuesday. ""Our first tax cut with Reagan was not 'revenue neutral.' The 1986 tax cut was spectacular. We went from 14 brackets to two brackets. This kind of thing can be done really well. The rhetoric behind it is a worry (from McConnell). Trump's going to get the corporate rate down and get rid of the death tax. That's good symbolically.""
According to Laffer, during an interview on Fox News, Trump's planned huge tax cuts, bringing rates down to 15% for corporations from 35%, will get the U.S. economy booming again. ""This is like the Kemp-Roth rate cuts. We need to do that right away. When the economy is booming, you can cut spending. Don't start with your weakest hand.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar steadied against the yen and euro on Tuesday after its weakest day in a week, with markets still uneasy that a Federal Reserve meeting ending on Wednesday may provoke more investors to cash in the greenback's recent gains. 
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) was the latest major bank to cast some doubt on a dollar rally extending into a first quarter set to be dominated by the first policy initiatives from the Trump administration. 
While investors have bet on the new president taking steps to bolster growth that will push inflation higher, there are also concerns that he may spark protectionism globally, driving cash into traditional safe havens like the yen. 
A rise in Fed interest rates on Wednesday, a big reason for the dollar index's 7 percent rise since September, looks fully priced in and there are also doubts over whether the U.S. central bank will want to send a strong signal that more tightening is to follow.
""We think the meeting may be a catalyst for people to take some profit on long dollar positions,"" Barclays analyst Hamish Pepper said.
""The dollar tends not to perform particularly well in December. If you put that together with a well priced Fed meeting plus already long positioning, it is the right set-up for a pullback.""
The yen strengthened to less than 115 yen per dollar in Asian trade before settling at 115.34, down 0.2 percent on the day but almost a full yen stronger than 24 hours previously. 
It has borne the brunt of the dollar's rally in the past month, down 13 percent since early October. But some traders and analysts have begun to wonder if the Japanese currency might benefit next year if global political risks grow.

""For now though the weak Q3 GDP result is enough to warrant some downward revision to growth forecasts - even with some anticipated 'bounce-back' in coming quarters.""
""Meanwhile, the rally in commodity prices is expected to be short-lived and is unlikely to translate into higher investment or wages at this point in the commodity cycle.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against the euro and a basket of currencies on Monday, an oil-driven rise in inflation expectations not enough to push on its broader rally as traders worried about the outcome of Wednesday's Federal Reserve policy meeting.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates this week and market concerns have turned to what signal it will send on further policy tightening and the dollar's 7 percent gain against a basket of major currencies since early October. (DXY) 
The euro gained almost half a percent in morning trade to push back above $1.06 , pushing the dollar index a third of a percent lower - an indication the market is not convinced the Fed will promise much in rate rises for next year.
""They (the Fed) really don't want to scare the market,"" said Alexandre Dolci, a strategist at Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) in London. 
""I think they will remain quite cautious in their forecasts for next year. They may not be as hawkish as the market currently prices.""
Another factor in the fall in the dollar index was a robust gain for the Canadian dollar on the back of the weekend deal by OPEC and non-OPEC producers to curtail output. 
That drove crude prices up by around 5 percent to their highest levels in a year and a half. The other major developed world oil-dominated currency, the Norwegian crown, gained 0.7 percent against the greenback.  
Expectations that would drive global inflation higher have generally supported the dollar above other major currencies in the past month and it was broadly stronger against the yen, topping 116 yen for the first time since early February.
But traders said signs Italy was ready to bail out its troubled third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi, was also feeding into a recovery for the euro after hefty losses following last week's European Central Bank meeting. 
While the ECB did announce a reduction in the amount of new money-printing it will do from April next year, by extending the program for longer than expected and tweaking other rules, it knocked more than 2 cents off the currency on Thursday.
That brings the dollar close to highs from last year at which Washington began to express concern.
""It's going to be hard to have the energy to make new lows (on the euro) before the Fed,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment at currency fund Millennium Global in London. 

""An explicit mention of the currency in either the statement or the news conference and it might become more difficult for the dollar.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro dropped on Friday for the second consecutive day after the European Central Bank on Thursday extended its bond-buying program longer than many had anticipated, even as it cut the size of the monthly purchases.
The ECB said it would reduce its monthly asset buys to 60 billion euros starting in April from 80 billion euros currently and extend purchases to December from March. It reserved the right to increase the size of purchases again.
Underlying its promise for extensive stimulus, the ECB predicted inflation at 1.7 percent in 2019, arguing that more-costly energy could boost consumer prices even without lifting the underlying trend.
“The extension of the program was longer than most had expected, and a lot of the language ... was pretty dovish,” said Erik Nelson, a currency analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. ""Inflation forecasts were pretty subdued all the way out to 2019, and growth forecasts were pretty low, and the risks are tilted to the downside.” 
The euro dropped to $1.0548, its lowest since Monday, and was last down 0.47 percent at $1.0566. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year when it meets next week but may take a cautious tone on the economy.
Traders will focus on the Fed’s economic projections, known colloquially as the dot plot, for indications of any change in expectations following Donald Trump's surprise election as U.S. president on Nov. 8.
Trump’s victory increased market expectations of greater fiscal stimulus that could boost economic growth and inflation.
“In the last three or four meetings, we’ve seen a continual marking down in the dot plot,"" Nelson said, ""so even if you see the officials maintain the current forecast, it could be viewed as mildly hawkish.” 

The dollar gained 0.37 percent to 101.47 against a basket of six major currencies (DXY). Against the Japanese yen <JPY=>, the greenback increased as high as 115.27 yen, its highest since Feb. 9, and was last up 0.76 percent at 114.86 yen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro dropped over 1 percent on Thursday after the European Central Bank extended asset purchases until the end of next year and President Mario Draghi said cuts to the size of the program should not be viewed as tapering.
The ECB said it will reduce its asset buys to 60 billion euros from next April from the current 80 billion euros, and extend purchase by an extra nine months from March. It also reserved the right to increase the size of purchases once again.
“The ECB is going to stay in the markets,” Draghi said in a press conference after the central bank’s statement.
“They are still going to buy a lot,” said Steven Englander, global head of foreign exchange strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. “The nine months is important because it pushes out the period over which you expect rates to be negative.”
The euro had strengthened ahead of Thursday's decision. It peaked at $1.0875 in the first minute after the statement before turning lower.
It last traded at $1.0617, down 1.26 percent on the day.
""Make no mistake, the ECB has eased monetary policy with this move,"" said Mizuho strategist Peter Chatwell. 
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year when it meets next week, though it is also seen as likely to take a cautious tone on the economy.
Traders will be watching for any indications of how many rate increases Fed officials expect in 2017, after Donald Trump’s surprise election as U.S. President on Nov. 8 increased expectations of greater fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth.
“Last meeting we had seven participants looking for three or more hikes next year and I think it’ll be a big deal if that seven goes to 10 or 11,” said Citi's Englander. 
That said, “they are also aware that rates are backing up and it might do damage to the housing market and the car auto market before any of this comes about, so I think they will be careful not to encourage it,” Englander said.

EUR/USD was at 1.0632 at 10:03 ET, down 1.11% for the day after touching an intra-high of 1.0873.
The ECB said it will reduce the size of its asset purchases from next year but will extend its asset purchase program for an additional nine months beyond March 2017.
The ECB said it will maintain the size of its monthly quantitative easing program at €80 billion until March and will reduce it to €60 billion per month as of April.
The asset purchases will continue at a pace of €60 billion per month until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, the ECB said.
The bank also changed the parameters of its bond purchasing program, removing the deposit limit floor, to address concerns that it may run out of bonds to buy.
Under the new rules governing asset purchases the ECB will be able to purchase government bonds which are yielding less than its deposit rate, which is currently at -0.4%.
That would enable the ECB to begin buying ultra-safe government bonds, such as German short-term debt.
The ECB also updated its economic forecasts and said it now expects slightly faster growth and higher inflation in 2017.
The ECB left its interest rates unchanged earlier Thursday.
ECB Governor Mario Draghi said that cutting QE to €60 billion a month is not ‘tapering’ and added that tapering was not discussed at today’s meeting.
Draghi said the decisions were taken to ensure the ECB has a “sustained presence in the market”.
Draghi also urged European leaders governments to “intensify” their efforts to create more growth-friendly fiscal policies and called for the “swift and effective implementations of structural reforms” to underpin the recovery.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2016 04:13AM ET</span>",Dollar edges up vs yen as traders eye ECB meeting for cues,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar edged back up toward a 10-month high against the yen on Wednesday, while most major currencies appeared to be looking ahead to Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting.
The ECB is widely expected to announce an extension to its quantitative easing program, but there is uncertainty over whether the size of the monthly asset purchases will be kept steady or scaled back, and over whether a formal signal on the eventual end of the asset-purchase program will be sent. 
If the ECB does say it will start to scale back its asset purchases - so-called tapering - the euro would be likely to rebound following a 4 percent fall against the dollar  over the past month, analysts said. 
On Wednesday it edged up 0.1 percent to $1.0724. The European currency had slumped on Monday to $1.0505, its lowest since March 2015, in a knee-jerk reaction after Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lost a referendum on constitutional reform and said he would resign. 
But it quickly jumped back to a 3-week high of $1.0797 on the same day as a worst-case political scenario for Rome appeared to have been averted for the time being, and as investors turned their attention to the ECB.
""People had gone into the referendum with a very pessimistic view and I think the last five years have taught us that, as far as the euro is concerned, political issues often don't have a lasting impact,"" said DZ Bank currency analyst Sonja Marten in Frankfurt.
The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 114.20 yen , not far from the peak of 114.83 hit last week, its highest against the Japanese currency since early February. The greenback has surged over 10 percent against the yen in the past month. 
Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Kikuo Iwata said on Wednesday that the central bank had not shifted its focus away from the pace of money printing and stressed it remained committed to using both rate cuts and asset purchases as key tools to revive the economy.
""The Fed is hiking rates, the ECB might extend the duration of its program... but the next big thing is going to be tapering,"" said Marten. ""There's a general move away from adding onto expansionary measures. So the central banks that continue to signal that they are willing to do that stand out.""
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat at 100.50 (DXY), having poked above 102.00 to a 13-1/2-year in late November as U.S. Treasury yields soared on prospects of president-elect Donald Trump adopting large fiscal spending and reflationary policies.
""There are not many factors for the market to trade on ahead of Thursday's ECB meeting, which remains the week's focal point,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. ""It could spell the beginning of the end of the Trump rally.""
The biggest mover among major currencies was the Australian dollar, which fell as much as 0.6 percent after weaker-than-expected GDP data .
The Canadian dollar was flat ahead of a Bank of Canada policy meeting that is expected to see interest rates left unchanged .

But concerns over Italy’s ailing banking sector remained in focus. Reuters reported late Tuesday that the government was preparing to take a €2 billion controlling stake in Monte dei Paschi, one of the country’s many troubled lenders.
Investors also remained cautious ahead of the ECB’s policy meeting on Thursday.
The ECB is seen as likely to announce an extension of its quantitative easing program, but any indication that it could begin tapering asset purchases could offset the effect of extending its stimulus program.

The GDP fall, the biggest since 2008, is likely one of the biggest forecasting misses by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which may have projected GDP growth of around 0.5%, according to calculations done byeconomists.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2016 08:35AM ET</span>",Euro inches lower as eyes shift to ECB meeting,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro retreated from a 3-week high on Tuesday while bets on market volatility stayed close to their highest since June’s Brexit vote ahead of this week's European Central Bank meeting on its quantitative easing program.
The Australian dollar was the morning's biggest loser, dipping as much as 0.4 percent after the Reserve Bank kept interest rates on hold but sounded a note of caution on the pace of growth. 
Other major currency pairs traded in a tight range after a rollercoaster ride following Sunday’s Italian constitutional referendum 'No' vote, which saw the euro dip to a 21-month low before rebounding more than 1.5 percent. 
The biggest rise in German industrial orders for more than two years in October prodded the single currency higher <EUR=> before a report on the possibility of Italian elections as soon as February unnerved investors. 
It was down just 0.2 percent at $1.0743 by 1235 GMT.
""Really eyes are moving to the ECB and we think the governing council will struggle to exceed the relatively dovish expectations being priced into the market,"" said Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy with  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London.
The dollar's inability to push on past $1.05 per euro after the Italian vote encouraged those in the market calling for a broader halt to the greenback rally the followed Donald Trump's U.S. election win. 
""I have a really hard time staying bullish on the dollar even though we have Italian government uncertainty on top of it all,"" Indosuez's Geneva-based head of FX and precious metals trading, Davis Hall, said.
""The range is probably still $1.0850 to $1.0250."" 
One-week implied volatility  has retreated from highs of almost 18 percent reached before Italy's vote, but at 13 percent is still almost double recent months' normal levels. 
ECB chief Mario Draghi is expected to lay out his plans for quantitative easing after next March at a news conference on Thursday.
At least a six-month extension of the program is now expected but many bank and fund analysts speculate that the bank might announce some sort of reduction or tapering of the monthly bond-buying amounts as part of that move.
Any such change in the direction of the ECB's policymaking would broadly be seen as a euro positive after almost two years of money-printing.
London's City Index Direct chief analyst, Kathleen Brooks, said the euro remained in a strong position within the G10 FX space, even after the Italian vote.

""As Italy’s banking sector can scrape together some foreign investment, mixed with a sweetened nationalized deal for Monte dei Paschi, then we can’t see how Italy’s political woes can have anything other than a temporary impact,"" Brooks said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro recovered from earlier weakness against the U.S dollar on Monday after Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's loss in a referendum over constitutional reform was seen by traders as largely expected and recent euro weakness was seen as having run too far.
Renzi is set to resign on Monday after the decision. The size of the ""No"" vote, at 59.1 percent, was more emphatic than had been forecast.
Renzi's resignation could open the door to an early election next year and the possibility of the anti-euro 5-Star Movement gaining power, though many investors and analysts see it as more likely that a caretaker government will be put in place until an election in 2018.
""There's not a large political implication for the euro and the euro is also very overextended,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), North American head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.
The single currency  tumbled as much as 1.4 percent in Asian trade to hit $1.0719, its weakest since March 2015, before recovering to $1.0709, up 0.43 percent on the day.
The greenback also weakened to 2-1/2 week lows against a basket of currencies on Monday as investors viewed recent dollar strength as overdone.
A solid but unexceptional U.S. jobs report for November on Friday failed to add additional fuel to the dollar rally sparked by Donald Trump's surprise presidential election victory on Nov. 8.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 178,000 jobs last month after increasing by 142,000 in October, the Labor Department said on Friday. However, wages slipped for the first time in nearly a year.
""The details in the nonfarm payrolls number were not that great,"" McCormick said. ""The dollar has overshot the rates story, and market positioning has moved kind of quickly, and so there is some scope for it to pull back over the next couple of weeks.""
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket if six major currencies, slipped 0.31 percent to 100.47, the lowest since Nov. 17. The index reached an almost 15-year high of 102.05 on Nov. 24.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>",Dollar dips before U.S. jobs data; eyes on Italy's vote,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was on course for its first weekly fall in four weeks against a basket of currencies on Friday after investors trimmed some bets against the euro on the run up to U.S. jobs data and Italy's constitutional referendum.
Positions on the euro have largely been taken on options markets this week, driving implied volatility of the currency - which could pay off for speculators in either direction - to its highest since Britain's June vote to leave the European Union. 
But spot rates for the single currency have held up as the U.S. currency drifted lower, a move that most analysts cast as a short-term correction to the dollar's surge since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. 
Most banks have forecast a broadly stronger dollar next year.
""We're in a period of consolidation. We saw this in October, we spent the whole month rising and then we had a week of sideways trading,"" said Neil Mellor, a strategist at BNY Mellon in London.
""I don't think we need to overcomplicate things today. You have the Friday factor, there is always a degree of reserve before payrolls. It does also feel as if liquidity is already falling ahead of the end of the year. Some people may be sitting back and waiting for January.""
In morning trade in Europe, the dollar index dipped 0.1 percent to 100.86 (DXY), down 0.6 percent for the week. It was marginally higher against the euro while pulling back from Thursday's 9-1/2-month highs of 114.83 yen. 
The logic behind the dollar's gains has been broadly about another rise in U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates later this month raising the premium for holding dollars. 
That now looks fully priced in, however, and some have argued the dollar may struggle for momentum until there is more clarity on Trump's economic policy proposals and their ability to raise inflation rates and in turn drive rates higher. 
There is also growing speculation that the ECB could include some sort of tapering of bond purchases in the reordering of its quantitative easing program set to be announced next month. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect that U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs in November, although a poorer batch of weekly jobs figures on Thursday hinted at a weaker number. 
The focus for the euro now is on an Italian referendum on Sunday that could reject constitutional reforms on which Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has staked his political future.
Renzi's departure could destabilize Italy's fragile banking system and be taken as another sign of rising anti-establishment sentiment around the world, potentially eroding investor confidence in the currency union. 
""High-frequency accounts and leveraged specs (speculative traders) have been reported on the bid, though there are plenty of offers ready to cap overdone rallies,"" analysts from currencies exchange LMAX said in a morning note. 

""There is sure to be plenty of volatility in Asia on Monday as the result of the Italian referendum comes in.""

309,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 04:10PM ET</span>",Dollar slips after November's gains; sterling strengthens,"By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Thursday against a basket of currencies as traders booked gains following a solid November on bets of a stronger U.S. economy under a Trump administration and on caution ahead of Friday's government payrolls report.
The greenback weakened against sterling on a perceived crack in Britain's ""hard Brexit"" line on leaving the European Union after Brexit minister David Davis said Britain would consider paying into the EU budget for market access. 
The pound rose as much as about 1.6 percent to a three-week high against the dollar of $1.2696. It was last up 0.5 percent at $1.2575.  
""The U.S. dollar is trading heavily against most of the major currencies, but the general tone appears consolidative in nature,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, in a research note.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.4 percent to 101.06. It reached a 13-1/2-year peak of 102.05 last week, and for the month of November it gained 3.1 percent (DXY).
The greenback pulled back from an earlier nine-month peak against the yen, at 114.82, before falling 0.4 percent to 114.03 yen in late trading .
The dollar's wobbly start in December reflected higher U.S. Treasury yields following upbeat data on manufacturing and construction spending. (US10YT=RR) 
Investors are waiting to see whether the government's jobs report for November, due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) on Friday, will support the view of faster U.S. growth, which could stoke further gains for the dollar.
The euro strengthened after Reuters reported the European Central Bank will extend its bond purchases beyond next March and consider sending a formal signal next week that the asset purchase program will eventually end.
Prolonging the ECB's quantitative easing was not unexpected as European growth remains sluggish, but even a token gesture that QE would end is positive for the euro.
""When you think the potential that the QE gravy train is not indefinite, that would cause upward pressure on the euro,"" said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.
The euro was boosted further after French President Francois Hollande said he will not seek a second term, a move seen paving an easier path for conservative Francois Fillon to defeat Marine Le Pen, head of the National Front party, in 2017.

The euro was up 0.6 percent at $1.0649  and up 0.2 percent against the yen, at 121.38 yen (EURJPY=).

EUR/USD was last at 1.0575, down 0.36% for the day. The single currency was also weaker against the pound, with EUR/GBP down 0.85% at 0.8478.
Fears over the financial health of the Italy’s banking sector mounted as Italian voters prepared to head to the polls on Sunday to vote on constitutional reforms.
Many analysts believe voters could reject Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s attempts to curb the power of the Senate.
A ‘No’ vote could trigger Renzi’s resignation and potentially clear the way for the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement to take power.
Up to eight Italian banks could fail if Renzi resigns as his bank bailout program would likely be scrapped.
Italy’s banks are weighed down by bad loans and could possibly require a full-blown bailout from the European Central Bank.
Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena is in the midst of a complex operation to shed €28 billion in bad loans and raise €5 billion as part of a rescue plan.
On Tuesday, the ECB said it is ready to temporarily step up purchases of Italian government bonds should Sunday’s referendum results drive up borrowing costs.
Separately, a report on Tuesday showed that global investors are becoming more concerned that the euro zone could break up.
The Frankfurt-based Sentix research group said that nearly 20% of investors expect Italy to leave the euro zone in the next 12 months, the highest level since they started polling four years ago.

340,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2016 10:50AM ET</span>",Venezuela currency tanks 60 percent in month on black market,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's bolivar currency has depreciated an unprecedented 60 percent in a month against the U.S. dollar on the black market to trade at nearly 3,500 on Monday, according to the widely-tracked web site DolarToday. 
That makes the largest-denomination note of 100 bolivars now worth less than 3 U.S. cents in the crisis-hit OPEC nation. 
Such is the currency chaos that Venezuelans often carry rucksacks full of cash for basic transactions, cashpoints are constantly running out, and some people are disparagingly using bolivar notes like scrap paper.
Local media say thieves, dissatisfied with the meager value of bank-notes, are starting to carry credit card machines to access victims' accounts during holdups in buses and restaurants. 
The bolivar's crash in recent days is the fastest depreciation on the black market since the ruling Socialists introduced currency controls in 2003.
Under the exchange scheme, President Nicolas Maduro's government offers a limited supply of dollars at 10 bolivars for priority imports such as food and medicine, and at 660 bolivars for other items.
But with demand outpacing supply, many use the black market, where the U.S.-based DolarToday site remains the main marker though the government calls it an illegal operation intended to sabotage the economy. DolarToday priced the greenback at 3,480 on Monday - up from 2,972 at the weekend, 2,193 last week, and 1,417 a month ago. 
Venezuela's official inflation rate hit 181 percent in 2015 and economists predict it will be far worse this year and next, though authorities have long stopped publishing monthly data. 
Monetary liquidity, a measure of total money supply, has also increased 111 percent so far this year, according to central bank data. 
Chronic shortages over the last two years have eased slightly in recent months. But that is mainly due to goods imported at the black market rate, which puts them out of reach for most in a nation where the minimum wage is 27,000 bolivars or around $8 on DolarToday.
Huge lines remain at shops for state-subsidized goods.
Baptized the ""bolivar fuerte"" or ""strong bolivar"" by former leader Hugo Chavez in a 2008 devaluation that removed three zeroes from the currency, many Venezuelans joke grimly that it is now the ""bolivar muerto"" or ""dead bolivar"". 

Critics say 17 years of failed socialist policies have wrecked the Venezuelan economy, while Maduro accuses opposition politicians, businessmen and the United States of waging an ""economic war"" against him.

The pound's long-term correlation with the dollar has kicked back in as the U.S. currency rallied in the past month and some major investors began to argue the market had come far enough to account for the initial risks related to Britain's planned departure from the European Union. 
That has made sterling among the best performing major currencies and given food to thought to the bears calling for a fall to $1.15 or lower in the first half of next year.
Lee Hardman, a currency analyst with Japan's MUFG in London, argued that the breakdown of third-quarter gross domestic product numbers also offered more hope. Business investment again topped expectations to grow by 0.9 percent on the quarter, although it was still down 1.6 percent year on year.
""The BoE has been warning that business investment would be the most vulnerable to heightened uncertainty related to the Brexit vote, but so far the negative impact is not yet evident,"" Hardman said. 

""If the UK economy continues to defy expectations for a material slowdown in growth in the year ahead, it will create scope for pound weakness to reverse further.""

346,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2016 04:15AM ET</span>","Dollar retreats from peaks, euro boosted by Fillon win","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar extended its losses on Monday, retreating from its highest levels since 2003 as U.S. Treasury yields eased from recent peaks.
The greenback had surged more than 4 percent against a basket of currencies (DXY) in the wake of Donald Trump's shock victory in the U.S. elections, with investors reckoning a Trump administration would see an expansion of fiscal policy, boosting inflation and pushing up interest rates. 
But after hitting an almost 14-year-high of 102.05 on Thursday, the dollar dipped on Friday and added to those losses on Monday, with the index down 0.7 percent at 100.82 by 0820 GMT, tracking 10-year U.S. Treasury yields lower (US10YT=RR). 
The greenback fell 1.2 percent to 111.865 yen , having soared more than 8 percent in the wake of Trump's victory to its highest levels in eight months against the safe-haven Japanese currency. 
Most analysts, though, said the dip in the dollar should not be interpreted as any kind of reassessment of the U.S. outlook, but simply as a corrective pullback. The greenback is still on track for its strongest two-monthly gains since early 2015. 
""This is probably a mixture of some cooling down after the strong moves last week, and also we have seen interest rates have come down globally, and that has weakened the dollar, just as the dollar strengthened with the rising rates the days before,"" said UBS currency strategist Daniel Trum, in Zurich. 
The euro climbed as much as 1.1 percent against the greenback  to an 11-day high of $1.0686, benefiting from the dollar's broad weakness and also boosted by the election of Francois Fillon as the center-right candidate in next year's French presidential elections.
The reformist former prime minister is now favorite to become president, with a flash opinion poll showing he would easily beat National Front leader Marine Le Pen in a run-off second round. Markets worry that the far-right Le Pen, who has promised a referendum on membership of the European Union if she wins, would threaten the future of the currency bloc. 
""He has been able to achieve quite a clear majority in the primaries so he's now quite a strong candidate going into the elections next year,"" said Trum.
The dollar could face some resistance this week ahead of potentially risk-laden events such as the midweek Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting, and Italy's Dec. 4 referendum on constitutional reform.
Crude oil has slumped amid uncertainty over whether OPEC would reach an output deal. And Italy's referendum could rattle financial markets by prompting the country's government to resign. 
Currencies will also have Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls to contend with.
""Those who have been following the dollar's uptrend since early November now sit on large profits, so it is not surprising if some lock the gains in,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

352,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2016 01:37PM ET</span>",Dollar weakens as U.S. bond yields slip from recent highs,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slid against major rivals on Friday as investors took advantage of a minor pullback in U.S. bond yields from recent highs and a holiday-shortened week to consolidate gains that had propelled the currency to a nearly 14-year peak.
Expectations of higher U.S. inflation and interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have driven the greenback to a more than 6 percent gain in the last two months, its strongest showing over a similar period since early 2015. 
Most currency players expect the gains to continue. But the combination of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, the processing of corporate flows before the month-end and perceived risks looming for markets in the first half of December led some to cash in gains now.
""The latest consolidation has many investors wondering if it's time to sell dollars,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.
""While there is no question that the dollar is getting ahead of reality and as tempting as it may be to pick a top, the latest pullback is small which means the better trade should be buying the dollar's dips until Fed Chair Janet Yellen tells us otherwise."" 
In afternoon trading on Friday, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were up slightly from the previous session at 2.359 percent, but off from Thursday's 16-month high of 2.417 percent (US10YT=RR). U.S. two-year yields (US2YT=RR) slipped from a more than six-year high hit earlier in the session and were last at 1.130 percent. The step-back in yields drove a modest selloff in the dollar.
In early afternoon trading, the dollar index fell 0.3 percent to 101.42 (DXY) after hitting an almost 14-month peak the previous session. The index posted its largest one-day fall since early November. 
After hitting an 8-month high of 113.90 yen  earlier, the dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 113.11 yen, although it still ended the week with a 2 percent gain.
The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.0601  after dropping to $1.0518 on Thursday, its lowest since March 2015.

Emerging market equities and currencies, meanwhile, have been hit hard by the specter of a possible Fed rate hike and potential U.S. trade protectionism under President-elect Donald Trump. The Turkish lira  slumped to a record low even after the country's central bank raised interest rates for the first time in nearly three years on Thursday. The lira was hurt as European Union lawmakers called for a temporary halt to EU membership talks with Ankara.

Investors are now pricing in a nearly 100 percent probability of a December Fed rate increase, according to CME FedWatch, and some investors expect more hikes in 2017 if economic momentum is sustained.
U.S. data on Wednesday showed new orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods rebounded last month on rising demand for machinery and equipment, while consumer sentiment rose this month following Donald Trump's election which many viewed as positive for their personal finances and the economy.
""The economic figures were better than expected, which also pushed up chances of an interest rate hike next month, to nearly 100 percent, with more hikes possible after that,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo. 
The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 112.56 yen  after rising as high as 112.98 yen on Wednesday, its loftiest peak since March.

Minutes of the Fed's Nov. 1-2 meeting, the last one ahead of the election, were released on Wednesday and showed the central bank was gearing up to raise rates.
Voting members of the Fed's rate-setting committee saw equal risks the economy would overshoot or undershoot their forecasts for continued growth and a tightening labor market.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar surged to a more than 13-year peak on Wednesday, bolstered by upbeat U.S. economic data that showed the economy on track for steady growth and reinforced expectations of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve next month and in 2017.
The greenback also posted sharp gains against the yen, rising to a more than seven-month high, and climbed versus the euro to its highest since early December. 
A 0.4 percent rebound in U.S. durable goods orders last month after a decline in September as well as solid U.S. jobless claims that have been below 300,000 for 90 straight weeks boosted the multiple rate hike view. 
""Speculation of a December rate hike reached mind-boggling levels,"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at Forex Time Ltd (FXTM) in Croydon, England. ""This could ensure dollar strength remains a key theme moving forward.""
Markets are now pricing in a nearly 100 percent probability of a December Fed rate increase, according to CME FedWatch.
In mid-morning New York trading, the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.7 percent to 101.73, after earlier soaring to a 13-1/2 year peak of 101.78. It has climbed more than 3 percent since President-elect Donald Trump's victory two weeks ago. 
Investors are betting the dollar will be strengthened by Trump's plans for fiscal stimulus, which may drive the Fed to raise rates faster than had been anticipated because of increased inflation.
China's offshore yuan, meanwhile, fell 0.5 percent on the day to a record low of 6.9470 per dollar  as traders grappled with the strengthening U.S. currency and signs of accelerating capital outflows following Trump's shock election win. [CNY/] 
Markets are now looking to the minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting due later on Wednesday.
FXTM's Otunuga said the minutes are widely expected to generate a hawkish tone and with a U.S. rate increase almost a certainty next month, most would be focusing on clues about interest rate timings for 2017.
The dollar rose more than 1 percent against the yen to 112.36  ahead of Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. It earlier hit a more than 7-month high of 112.47 yen.
The euro, meanwhile, continued its descent, down 0.7 percent at $1.0546, after touching its lowest level for the year.

The euro is facing a host of political risks in the coming months, including an Italian constitutional referendum in less than two weeks and French and German elections next year, that are seen as likely to drive the currency lower.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2016 01:09AM ET</span>",Cooling growth pulls China's yuan down to third place in global trade finance: SWIFT,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's yuan slipped one place to the third most-active currency for global trade finance, overtaken by the euro, partly due to slowing growth in the world's second-biggest economy, global transaction service provider SWIFT said on Wednesday.
The rapid cool-down in China over recent years was also a factor in the yuan moving one notch down to sixth most-used world payment currency, with the Canadian dollar nudging ahead to fifth place. 
The yuan's usage by value in traditional trade finance – letters of credit and collections – has been decreasing since 2014. Its market share fell to 4.61 percent from 8.66 percent three years ago when it was the second most-active currency in trade finance after the dollar, according to SWIFT.
Since October 2013, trade finance values in the yuan have decreased by 66 percent, whilst trade finance across all currencies decreased in value by 35 percent.
""The general slowdown of the Chinese and world economies over the past few years has impacted global trade growth across all currencies, not just the yuan,"" says Michael Moon, Asia Pacific head of Payments Markets at SWIFT. 
""On a positive note, the inclusion of the yuan in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) basket should generate further trust and confidence in the RMB currency and support further yuan internationalization.""
In terms of international payments, compared to September 2016, the yuan has dropped one position to the sixth for international payments in October, with a share of 1.67 percent. The Canadian dollar, with a share of 1.82 percent, pulled up to fifth place.
The decrease in the yuan's international payments usage was likely due to seasonal effects following the Golden Week holiday in China in October, SWIFT said.
Yuan payments value decreased by 22.44 percent in October from a month earlier, whilst in general all payments currencies decreased by only 5.96 percent. 
The yuan has depreciated more than 5 percent against the dollar so far this year, with its decline gathering speed since Republican Donald Trump's upset U.S. election win boosted the greenback against most other global currencies.
Many analysts, including those from HSBC and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), have recently revised down their forecasts for yuan/dollar in the coming months, as capital outflows accelerate from emerging markets to the U.S. on expectations Trump-led policies will boost fiscal spending and lift U.S. interest rates.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar retreated from a six-month peak against the yen on Tuesday, while a push higher for copper and iron ore prices drove commodities-linked currencies higher, led by the Australian dollar. 
Two bullish weeks for the dollar since the election of Donald Trump looked to be subsiding before the Thanksgiving holiday, and traders said the widening of an oil rally to other commodities was encouraging a squeeze on pro-dollar positions.
""If we're going to have a wobble in the trades that have worked post-Trump, then the next 10 days is probably it,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London.
""We could see another 1 percent squeeze from here. $1.0850 is the line in the sand for the euro, 100.30 was the breakout level for the DXY (dollar index).""
An earthquake of magnitude 7.4 and a subsequent tsunami warning in northern Japan prompted knee-jerk selling of the dollar for the safe-haven yen in Asian trade. Choppy morning trading in London saw the pair flat at 110.76 yen. 
The Aussie, which tends to move in tandem with prices of the iron ore it exports to China and other major commodity consumers, was up 0.4 percent at $0.7398. 
Iron ore, rebar and coking coal all hit limit-up levels in China as speculators bought following recent dips, while global oil prices rose to their highest point since October as the market priced in a possible output cut led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 
London copper jumped 2 percent to its highest in more than a week. 
The dollar was flat on the day at $1.0633 euro, having retreated more than half a cent from an almost 1-year high of $1.0569 hit on Friday. 
""There is a feeling that the step adjustment in the dollar has already happened,"" RBC head of G10 FX strategy Adam Cole said, outlining a 2017 outlook that called for the dollar to fall back to around 100 yen.
""A December rate hike is now totally discounted. Two more hikes next year are 80 percent discounted. At these levels I would like to start fading the rally in dollar-yen.""
On Monday, the greenback had set a near six-month high of 111.36 yen, which amounted to a gain of 10 percent from its Nov. 9 trough near 101 yen.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2016 07:38AM ET</span>",Euro climbs as political uncertainty seen easing a touch,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro rose from an 11-month low against a broadly weaker dollar on Monday with political developments seen easing uncertainty surrounding next year's German and French elections, lending some support to the currency.
Although German Chancellor Angela Merkel's announcement on Sunday that she would seek a fourth term in office did not come as a surprise, it was regarded by strategists as positive for the euro.
Merkel is seen as a defender of liberal democracy in the West at a time when investors are worried that a wave of populism and anti-globalization sentiment is spreading across Europe and threatening the break-up of the euro zone.
The euro climbed half a percent to $1.0645 , having touched its weakest levels since December 2015 on Friday.
""If Merkel is going for chancellor again, even if she has to be in a grand coalition, the likelihood is that she will be re-elected ... That creates some stability from a European perspective,"" said UBS's head of currency strategy in Zurich, Constantin Bolz. 
In France, former president Nicolas Sarkozy was ousted in a party primary from the election race over the weekend, leaving ex-prime ministers Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe to battle it out to become the center-right Republicains' candidate for the presidential election in May.
The winner is expected to face far-right, anti-EU National Front leader Marine Le Pen. Some analysts said the defeat of the deeply unpopular Sarkozy had lessened the prospects of her winning, easing investor fears about a break-up of the euro zone. 
Others, however, maintained that the socially conservative and pro-business Fillon - who won the first round primary ballot with 44 percent of the vote - increased the perceived risk that Le Pen could take power, as he lacked the broad appeal of the more centrist Juppe.
""There had been some concern that if Sarkozy was up against Le Pen, that would not be a particularly good circumstance,"" Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said in London. 
""The market has always been fairly confident that Le Pen would fail to win the second (presidential election) round, but after the Trump victory, markets began to get a little doubtful about what opinion polls were suggesting."" 
Strategists said that the euro had also been boosted by a slight weakening of the dollar, which was down 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies after hitting its highest levels in almost 14 years on Friday (DXY). 
The greenback has climbed more than 3 percent since the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Investors bet that a Trump administration will adopt expansionary fiscal policies leading to interest rate rises. 
Most market participants expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. 
Against the yen, the dollar hit a six-month high of 111.190 yen , before easing back to 110.50, down a third of a percent on the day. 
Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed that speculators trimmed their dollar bets in the week through Nov. 15, as profit-taking reduced net long positions after they had risen seven straight weeks.
Japanese yen net longs, meanwhile, posted their lowest level since early June, the data showed, with the yen a casualty of the dollar's strong rally.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar climbed on Friday to its highest level since 2003 on continued bets on faster inflation and higher interest rates, while Treasuries resumed a selloff that left yields at their highest levels of the year.
A growing perception that the economic policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will lift consumer prices pushed the dollar higher.
On Wall Street, the tech- and biotech-heavy Nasdaq Composite hit a record intraday high before slipping lower. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 were also near record highs despite the day's decline.

BOND SELLOFF RESUMES
Last week's unexpected U.S. election victory from political neophyte Trump has led to a repricing of assets, most notably in currency and bond markets.
Federal Reserve policymaker James Bullard said on Friday he is leaning towards supporting a rate rise in December, adding that a plethora of potential changes under Trump could affect future policy.
The euro <EUR=> fell 0.3 percent to $1.0593, while the yen  weakened to 110.83, having earlier fallen to 110.92 per dollar. 
The dollar index (DXY) hit a high of 101.48, its highest level since April 2003. It has risen over 4 percent in the last two weeks, its biggest fortnightly rise since March 2015.
The election's outcome briefly spooked financial markets worldwide but they quickly reversed course as traders seized on tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending which Trump campaigned on as positives for the greenback.
""It has caused a wave of dollar buying across the board,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.
To be sure, it is unclear how many if any of these proposals would materialize. Trump's stance on immigration and trade, if they become law, could hurt the dollar, analysts said.
The yield on U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) rose to 2.355 percent, which was the highest since December. Yields on Treasuries of all maturities have registered the largest two-week gains in more than five years as investors have dumped U.S. government debt since Election Day.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to its highest level since April 2003 against a basket of currencies on Friday, marking its biggest two-week increase since March 2015 as traders piled bets on a massive dose of fiscal stimulus under a Trump U.S. presidency.
Also stoking the dollar rally were growing expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next month on signs of rising inflation and improved economic growth. 
The greenback has climbed 7.3 percent against the yen in two weeks, its steepest such gain since January 1988 and its second-strongest performance in the era of floating exchange rates. 
The dollar has been on a tear following Republican Donald Trump's Nov. 8 victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, tracking surging U.S. Treasury yields amid concerns government borrowing to fund possible stimulus programs could stoke inflation. 
Traders have seized on the tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending that Trump campaigned on as negatives for bonds and positives for the dollar. 
""It has caused a wave of dollar buying across the board,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.
To be sure, it remained unclear how many, if any, of the policy proposals would materialize. Trump's stance on immigration and trade, if they become law, could hurt the dollar, analysts said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to its highest level in almost 14 years against a basket of currencies on Friday, while U.S. bond yields were set for their biggest fortnightly rise in 13 years on bets U.S. inflation and interest rates are headed higher. 
A growing perception that the economic policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will push up consumer prices helped put the dollar on track for its biggest two-week rise against Japan's yen in almost 30 years.
European shares nudged down <.GDAX> (FTSE) (CAC) and U.S. stock futures (ESc1) pointed to a flat open for Wall Street.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) slipped 0.4 percent to hover just above four-month lows touched earlier in the week. It logged its fourth straight week of losses.
The dollar's rise against the yen  raised hopes of an earnings boost to Japanese exporters, helping lift the Nikkei average (N225) to a 10-month high. The blue-chip Japanese stock index closed 0.6 percent higher. 
Data on Thursday suggesting the U.S. jobs market is tightening and inflation is gaining traction have bolstered a view that U.S. growth and inflation could accelerate if the Trump administration cuts taxes and increases fiscal spending.
Last week's unexpected U.S. election result has prompted investors to ditch their once rock-solid conviction that growth in developed economies will remain tepid because of tough competition from emerging market economies with lower wages.
That has led to a repricing of assets, most notably in currency and bond markets.
""What we're looking at is a broad shift of investment back to the U.S.,"" said Richard Cochinos, Citi's head of G10 currency strategy in London.
""There are expectations for tax cuts next year - which were part of the Trump campaign's promises - and then there's also the idea of what type of fiscal boost are you going to have. That's what's driving asset prices – it's people's expectations for the fiscal impulse next year,"" he said.
Federal Reserve policymaker James Bullard said on Friday he is leaning toward supporting a rate rise in December, adding that a plethora of potential changes under Trump could affect future policy.
BONDS RUMBLED
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) rose to 2.34 percent, its highest since December. It is up about 51 basis points over the last two weeks - the biggest fortnightly rise in 13 years.
Global bond indices are set for their biggest two-week loss in decades in a sign that a three-decade bull run for fixed income could be at a turning point. 
Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index is poised to record a 4 percent loss over the last fortnight <.BCGA>, its steepest fall since at least 1990, according to Reuters data.
In Europe, Italian bonds <IT10YT=TWEB> have borne the brunt of selling as investors fret about the political repercussions of a referendum next month that could further destabilize a country battling a banking crisis and a weak economy.
Italian banking stocks came under renewed pressure on Friday from referendum jitters. Italy's bank sector index (FTIT8300) fell as much as 4.2 percent to its lowest level since October 5.
Following Trump's election win, there was also some focus on France, where the vote for the conservative candidate for the French presidency takes place this Sunday.
Rising bond yields across the globe also reflect a reassessment of the Federal Reserve's policy path down the road, beyond a likely rate hike in December. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Thursday that Trump's election has done nothing to change the Fed's plans for a rate rise ""relatively soon."" 
Money markets are starting to price in one or more rate hikes next year, a sea change from before the election when they priced in a less than 50 percent chance of a 2017 rate hike.
The dollar rose to 110.92 yen <JPY=>, its highest level since last May. The euro <EUR=> slumped to $1.0583, a low last seen almost a year ago.
The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies (DXY), <=USD> rose to 101.37, its highest level since April 2003. It has risen over 4 percent in the last two weeks, its biggest fortnightly rise since March 2015. 
WEAK EMS
A rising dollar is a problem for some emerging economies that could see potentially destabilizing capital outflows.
The Turkish lira  fell nearly 1 percent to a record low.
The Mexican peso <MXN=>, a lightning rod for market anxiety over Trump, more than matched the lira's fall. Investors were disappointed the central bank raised rates by only 50 basis points to 5.25 percent on Thursday to stem the sell-off, which saw the currency plunge to record lows after the election.
Gold <XAU=> fell to a 5-1/2-month low of $1,203.52 per ounce on the back of a stronger dollar.
Brent crude oil prices <LCOc1 > were set for their first weekly gain in five on renewed hopes that OPEC might agree production cuts, but a stronger U.S. dollar capped gains.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar powered to its highest levels since 2003 against a basket of currencies on Friday, with Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election helping to give the greenback its best fortnight against the yen in almost 30 years. 
Further underpinning the dollar was a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who on Thursday provided a signal that U.S. interest rates would rise next month, in line with most market participants' expectations.
The greenback hit a six-month high against the yen of 110.925 <JPY=>. It has gained around 7 percent in the last two weeks against the Japanese currency, its strongest showing since January 1988 and its second-strongest performance in the era of floating exchange rates. 
The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major rivals, hit 101.37 (DXY), its highest since early April 2003.
""What we're looking at is a broad shift of investment back to the U.S.,"" said Richard Cochinos, Citi's head of G10 currency strategy in London. 
""There are expectations for tax cuts next year - which were part of the Trump campaign's promises - and then there's also the idea of what type of fiscal boost are you going to have. That's what’s driving asset prices - it's people's expectations for the fiscal impulse next year,"" he said. 
Cochinos added that political and economic worries in Europe, Britain and Japan were keeping investors away from those currencies, providing the dollar with another boost.
While Yellen did not explicitly say the Fed would take action at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting, she told a Congressional committee that a rate hike was likely ""relatively soon"". 
Thursday's U.S. data gave even more credence to December rate-hike bets, with housing starts marking a nine-year peak, weekly jobless claims falling to a 43-year low and consumer prices posting their biggest increase in six months. 
Markets are now pricing in a more than 90 percent chance of a rate hike by the end of the year, according to CME FedWatch. 
""The new U.S. policy mix suggests that more Fed hikes have to be priced,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) currency strategist Olivier Korber in Paris. 
""With lasting policy uncertainty and potential protectionism, there are probably enough ingredients to consider the risk of massive new dollar appreciation. If the negative political surprises don't stop there and have a far more dramatic impact on Europe, the euro could fall much more."" 
The euro - which is facing a slew of political risks, including an Italian constitutional referendum next month and French and German elections next year - hit an 11-month low of $1.0582 <EUR=> before recovering to trade flat on the day at $1.0620.

395,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 05:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China ready to slow yuan descent, worried about capital outflows - sources","By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese policymakers have been unfazed by the yuan's recent slide, but are ready to slow its descent for fear of fanning capital flight if the currency falls too quickly through the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level, policy advisers said.
The yuan fell on Friday to an eight-year low of 6.8950 per dollar, extending a sharp decline in the past week and taking its fall so far this year to 5.8 percent. If maintained, it would mark the yuan's biggest annual decline since the landmark revaluation in 2005.
Chinese policymakers believe the decline in the yuan since October reflects market trends, especially of late when most currencies have fallen in the face of a resurgent U.S. dollar.
But the yuan's outlook is clouded by the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president because he promised during campaigning to label China a currency manipulator on Jan 20, his first day in office, and to impose tariffs on Chinese imports.
""The central bank is following the trend as the dollar is rising. It's not necessary for it to resist market forces,"" said a policy adviser, who declined to be identified when recalling policy discussions.
""Appropriate yuan depreciation will be good for stabilizing market expectations and the economy, as long as there is no sharp, run-away depreciation.""
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, declined to comment.
Beijing's biggest concern is that a sharp fall in the yuan will trigger the sort of capital flight that followed August's surprise devaluation of the currency, which sparked fears the health of the economy was worse than Beijing had let on. China's currency reserves slumped by more than $400 billion by the end of January as Chinese moved cash overseas.
Outflows from the $3 trillion-plus reserves, by far the world's largest, have since continued at a much more subdued pace but the yuan's decline in recent weeks has raised some concerns that capital flight could pick up again if the yuan slides too fast.
""I don't think the breaking of 7 is imminent. We may have to wait until next year,"" said a second adviser. ""If the pace of depreciation is too fast, if it hit 7 before the end of this year, the central bank will control it.""
BOTTOM LINE?
The policy insiders said the central bank was likely to intervene in currency markets and enforce capital controls to slow the rate of decline in the yuan. But 7 per dollar is not a line in the sand, the advisers said.
""I don't think it will deliberately choose the 7 level to fight a duel,"" said the first adviser, in part to avoid wasting currency reserves.
Indeed, traders said large Chinese state banks had offered dollars in the domestic currency market on Thursday in an apparent effort to slow down the depreciation of the yuan. They said there had been no sign of state dollar selling in previous sessions.
This year, the central bank has been guiding the yuan lower by pegging it to the dollar when the U.S. currency weakens and pegging it to a basket of currencies when the dollar rises, analysts said. So in recent weeks, the yuan has held largely steady against the basket.
On a daily basis, the central bank sets the yuan's mid-point versus the dollar based on the previous day's closing price, taking into account changes in major currencies.
UNCERTAINTIES FROM TRUMP
Still, a bigger duel may be beckoning.
Concerns about a sharp slowdown in China's economy have eased to be replaced by worries that Beijing could be heading into a trade war with the United States if Trump follows through on his campaign rhetoric.
Trump lambasted China throughout the election, drumming up headlines with pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator.
China was regularly criticized by the United States and some other western governments who argued it used a cheap currency to boost exports. But that criticism has died down in recent years as economic growth slowed and as the government sought to shift away from a reliance on exports and more towards consumption.
""Imposing tariffs on China would do more harm than good for the United States, including its employment, and it has to consider that China could counter with its own measures,"" said a commerce ministry researcher.
""I don't think the exchange rate will become an imminent problem. The yuan is depreciating but won't depreciate too much and many people believe the dollar could fall if Trump takes some radical measures.""
Chinese President Xi Jinping told Trump that cooperation was the only choice for relations between the world's two largest economies, with Trump saying the two had established a ""clear sense of mutual respect"".

Assuming no major ructions from a Trump presidency, some government economists expect the yuan to fall to 7.2 per dollar by the end of 2017, which would imply a drop of 4.2 percent from the current level.

Draghi said on Friday that the ECB would base the decision on the withdrawal of stimulus on its analysis of whether the recovery in inflation can sustain itself.
""Going forward, our assessment will depend on whether we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards that objective,"" Draghi told the European Banking Conference in Frankfurt.
""And that means that inflation convergence towards 2% is durable, even with a reduction in monetary accommodation. Inflation dynamics, in other words, need to be self-sustained,"" he explained.

This was its 10th consecutive session of losses, its longest stretch since its creation in 1999.
Even before Draghi’s speech, the currency pair was under pressure due to the strength of the dollar after Yellen paved the way for the Fed to hike interest rates in December.
In her testimony to the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee on Thursday, Yellen warned of the danger of waiting too long to tighten monetary policy.
Yellen referenced the November 2 Fed meeting and stated that policymakers judged back then that an increase in rates could “become appropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee's objectives.”
“Were the FOMC to delay increases in the federal funds rate for too long, it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly overshooting both of the Committee's longer-run policy goals,” she warned.
The greenback hit fresh 14-year highs against a basket of other currencies Friday, marking an intraday high of 101.44. That was its highest level since April 2003.

Mexico's central bank raised rates to 5.25 percent on Thursday, the highest level since May 2009, but the market had been looking for a hike of at least 75 basis points.
The peso has been in the firing line over worries that U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will carry out his campaign threats to impose trade tariffs and block remittances. 
The peso is still flat against the dollar this week but shed almost 9 percent last week after tumbling to a record low in the wake of Trump's win, posting its biggest two-day loss since a 1995 devaluation.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>",Indian rupee seen weathering dollar surge better than most in emerging FX,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) - Protected against excessive volatility by India's central bank and backed by one of the world's fastest growing economies, the rupee could withstand the U.S. dollar's post-election surge better than many emerging market currencies, economists say.
Expectations that President-elect Donald Trump's expansionary spending plans will lead to higher U.S. interest rates drove the dollar (DXY) on Wednesday to its highest level in 13-1/2 years against a basket of major currencies. 
But while emerging markets currencies have on average lost 4.6 percent against the dollar since Trump's election victory on Nov.8, the rupee  has lost only 2 percent.
Against its peers, the rupee is proving attractive.
Its three-month volatility  hit an eight-year low earlier this month, while its volatility-adjusted returns, as measured by the Sharpe ratio, are positive at 0.4 percent, while most other Asian market currencies show negative returns, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Analysts expect the rupee to continue to fare better than emerging market peers because of the country's faster economic growth, and near-record foreign exchange reserves of $368 billion, which the Reserve Bank of India's regularly dips into to smooth out excessive volatility in the currency market.
""India's external position strengthened significantly over the past couple of years. It doesn't rely on foreign financing as much as it used to. It has also been evident in the rupee being stable,"" said Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics in Singapore. 
The rupee's sturdiness has come despite net outflows of about $1.6 billion from Indian bonds and equities and an estimated $7 billion in outflows in October to meet redemptions from dollar deposits the country raised to help pull the rupee out of a crisis in 2013. 
The RBI intervenes frequently on both sides of the market to keep the rupee free of excessive volatility as a matter of policy.
During September, the most recent available data shows the RBI purchased $9.04 billion in the spot foreign exchange market and sold $4.4 billion - its heaviest intervention since April 2015. 
The rupee's three-month volatility  was trading at 6.1 percent after hitting a near 8-year low of 4.475 percent earlier this month. That compares, according to Reuters' calculations, to Asian currencies' average volatility of 8.7 percent.
Economic indicators should also underpin the rupee. India's economy grew 7.1 percent in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace among major economies.
Analysts expect this to accelerate as the central bank is expected to cut interest rates again after already easing by 175 bps since early last year. 
Investors have reacted positively to rate cuts given expectations it will boost economic growth and attract more foreign inflows into equity markets, despite the potential reduction in rupee yields.
India's current account deficit also stood at a negligible $277 million, or 0.1 percent of gross domestic product, in the April-June quarter, while consumer inflation cooled to a 13-month low in September, helped by moderating food prices.

""We have been constructive on rupee for some time. The currency is very stable. There has been an attractive carry trade in the past month and we continue to hold that view. In our view rupee has been relatively protected from more external factors."" said Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy at Asia-pacific for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Singapore.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2016 04:09AM ET</span>",Dollar pulls back ahead of Yellen testimony,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell back against other major currencies on Thursday, hit by speculation U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen will express concern over the pace of its surge to a 13 1/2-year high in the past week and an accompanying rise in bond yields. 
The dollar has ground its way higher this week after jumping in the days following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election last Tuesday, fuelled by expectations a Trump White House would drive up inflation. 
But with two months until his inauguration and a rise in Fed interest rates now fully priced in for next month, several banks say the currency could drift. 
Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in London, said that Fed speakers this week had sounded divided on their view on the effective tightening of monetary conditions since Trump's election.
""All eyes are on Yellen today,"" he said. 
""She may not share markets' enthusiasm about the future impact of Trump's policies. And she could express concern about the dollar's rapid gains and the tightening of conditions through higher bond yields. That could spur some profit-taking on the bullish dollar positions."" 
In early trade in Europe, the greenback fell around 0.2 percent against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength, a half point off almost 14-year highs hit on Wednesday. (DXY) 
It was flat on the day at 109.03 yen and 0.2 percent lower against the euro at $1.0709.
""I have been long the dollar against the euro for three days,"" said Louis Gargour, chief investment officer with hedge fund LNG in London. 
""$1.05 is not out of the question. Will I be in the trade that long (until Trump's inauguration), maybe not. Let's look at the cabinet, let's look at who he puts in place and whether his policy will be as good (for the dollar) as people expect.""
The yen took a knock overnight when the Bank of Japan conducted its first special operation to curb rising yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs). The offer was priced to attract no bids, but knocked government bond yields further back into negative territory, pushing the dollar briefly as high as 109.30 yen .
""Rises in U.S. yields have been a significant factor behind the dollar's strength, but since that has started to calm down for now, moves in the dollar against yen have also settled down,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, a Tokyo-based FX strategist for  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is now at 2.199 percent (US10YT=RR), after reaching a 10-month high of 2.302 percent earlier in the week.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 100.26.
On Wednesday, the index hit highs of 100.60, its highest level since April 2003.
The dollar has powered higher on expectations that the Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates next month.
Philadelphia Fed head Patrick Harker said Wednesday that he was in favor of raising interest rates, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said the Fed must not overreact to market moves following the shock result of the presidential election.
Investors have assigned an 85.8% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting; according to federal funds futures tracked Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Expectations for higher rates typically boost the dollar by making it more attractive to yield seeking investors.
The dollar has also been boosted by rising U.S. government bond yields and expectations for ramped up fiscal stimulus once Donald Trump becomes president.
Many investors believe that Trump's campaign pledges to boost spending, cut taxes and loosen financial regulation will lead to a pickup in economic growth and inflation.
Faster growth would spark inflation, which in turn would prompt the Fed to tighten monetary policy a faster rate than had previously been expected.
The dollar was steady against the yen, with USD/JPY at 109.05, holding just below the five-and-a-half month high of 109.74 set on Wednesday.
The euro pushed higher, with EUR/USD rising 0.22% to 1.0715, after falling to lows of 1.0665 on Wednesday, its lowest level since December 2015.
The pound also edged higher, with GBP/USD easing up 0.14% to 1.2461.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2016 02:30AM ET</span>",Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Praveen Menon
HONG KONG/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Foreign banks in Malaysia on Thursday were trying to work out how to comply with the central bank's clamp-down on offshore ringgit trading, a move the broader market views as a form of capital controls. 
Form letters, sent this week from onshore banks to their offshore counterparts, asked compliance officers to sign commitments to cease trading the ringgit in the NDF markets and then send the letters back to Bank Negara, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
""There's a massive back and forth going on between banks and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) now,"" said a banker at a foreign bank in Malaysia that deals in foreign currency transactions. ""This is a type of indirect capital control ... I see a flood of people exiting Malaysia."" 
The ringgit  had fallen nearly 1 percent on Thursday to a fresh 11-month low of 4.3850 against the dollar. The offshore spreads in NDF markets widened, while bond yields shot higher with the 10-year benchmark yield (MY10YT=RR) trading 17 basis points up at 4.22 percent. It has risen nearly 60 basis points in the last week.
Investors typically use the liquid NDF markets in Singapore and Hong Kong to exchange ringgit for dollars because of the many restrictions in the domestic market.
Singapore and Hong Kong are ranked third and fourth at $517 billion and $437 billion respectively on global daily average turnover of foreign exchange derivatives, according to the latest survey from the Bank of International Settlements. The United States and Britain are the top two.
'STATE OF LIMBO'
While Malaysia allows foreigners relatively open access to its domestic bond and stock markets, it prohibits any offshore trading of its currency or related derivatives. 
Some foreign banks said they were told their investments cannot be moved out of Malaysia if they don't sign the letter. The head of trading at a Western Bank in Hong Kong described the situation as ""being in a state of limbo"" due to the regulatory uncertainty.
""We have been told that we cannot repatriate our money and our investments stay in Malaysia if we don't sign,"" he said. 
The bankers asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.
Foreign holdings account for 40 percent of the total outstanding bond market in Malaysia, one of the largest foreign ownerships in Asia.
Foreigners have been fleeing the Malaysian market in a global bond rout following Donald Trump's election as U.S. President last week, which sent the dollar soaring and has hit emerging market currencies particularly hard.
PUNITIVE ACTION
Bank Negara Malaysia has asked financial institutions to provide a detailed plan if they need to make ringgit transactions onshore and to seek help from Malaysian financial institutions for any foreign exchange transaction needs.
The central bank on Wednesday warned it could act against lenders who do not comply with the measures.
""We can take (punitive action) as they will be breaching the Foreign Exchange Administration (FEA),"" Assistant Governor Adnan Zaylani told reporters in a Wednesday briefing.
""We can even take criminal or administrative action (against them),"" he was quoted saying by state news agency Bernama.
Bankers, however, say Bank Negara has no oversight over trades outside its jurisdiction. 
Malaysia was one of the only countries to impose capital controls during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis by fixing the exchange rate and requiring the currency be held at least a year after the sale of Malaysian securities or assets in the country. It was widely viewed as a major contributing factor to its subsequent economic recovery. 
Foreign investors pulled 8.4 billion ringgit out of government bonds in September, the largest outflow since August last year when Malaysia's markets tumbled on a political crisis swirling around Prime Minister Najib Razak and corruption allegations involving indebted state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

In October, however, there were inflows of 2.39 billion ringgit into government bonds, and foreign reserves rose to $97.8 billion by the end of the month, up from $97.7 billion at the end of September. The reserves were enough to finance 8.4 months of retained imports.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar climbed to a near 14-year high against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, even as analysts cautioned the greenback is vulnerable to a letdown from its surge tied to bets on pro-growth policies under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 
The euro deteriorated to its weakest level in almost a year against the greenback. Trump's stunning victory on Nov. 8 has raised concerns about a rising tide of potentially destabilizing wins for populist candidates and issues on ballots across Europe in the coming year.
""The market has gone a bit too far ahead of itself. It looks vulnerable for a short-term pullback,"" said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2016 01:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Malaysia demands foreign banks commit to stop offshore ringgit trading - sources,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Jongwoo Cheon
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia's central bank is asking foreign banks to make a written commitment to refrain from trading the ringgit in the offshore non-deliverable forwards market in its latest move to protect a weakening currency, banking sources said.
The central bank has sent a form letter to foreign banks, which asks for an ""unconditional representation and commitment"" to stop trading in any offshore Malaysian ringgit  non-deliverable forwards or offshore derivatives.
Two separate sources at banks confirmed receipt of the letter.
The letter also asks financial institutions to provide a detailed plan to the central bank of its needs to make ringgit transactions onshore and to seek help from Malaysian financial institutions for any foreign exchange transaction needs. 
The letter is a marked change from Saturday's central bank notification, in which foreign funds and asset managers were asked to contact Malaysian licensed banks to execute any foreign exchange transactions. It suggests authorities are tightening controls on the ringgit.
""It's not surprising, given how much MYR (ringgit) has lost. It sounds like a desperate intervention,"" said Nordea Markets' chief analyst Amy Yuan Zhuang in Singapore.
Malaysia's ringgit  touched a 10-month low to $4.3470 to the dollar at around 0630 GMT.
Bank Negara's comparatively small foreign reserves compared to other Asian countries, has left the central bank with fewer options, she said. ""It needs such measures more than other Asian central banks.""

At 40 percent of the total outstanding bond market, Malaysia's foreign holdings are one of the largest in Asia. Investors typically use the liquid NDF markets in Singapore and Hong Kong to hedge their exposure because of the many restrictions in the domestic market.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2016 07:10AM ET</span>",Dollar rise a threat to global financial stability: BIS,"By Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar is now the best barometer of global investor risk appetite and financial market leverage, making its current surge potentially destabilizing for the global financial system, a senior BIS official said on Tuesday.
Hyun Song Shin, head of research at the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements, said in a speech that ""when the dollar is strong, risk appetite is weak"". 
""The dollar as a barometer of leverage and risk-taking capacity has implications for both financial stability and the real economy,"" he said at the London School of Economics
""Given the dollar's role as barometer of global appetite for leverage, there may be no winners from a stronger dollar."" 
Shin said the dollar had supplanted the VIX index as the variable most associated with the appetite for leverage.
The VIX volatility index measures implied volatility in U.S. stock markets. The dollar has supplanted it as the gauge to watch in large part thanks to the breakdown since the financial crisis in what is known as ""covered interest parity"".
Covered interest parity theory holds that interest rates implied by FX trading should be consistent with market interest rates, so that there are no interest rate arbitrage opportunities between the two.
But an anomaly between the two has emerged since 2008, and has deepened as the dollar has risen steadily over the past two years, particularly in the dollar/yen market. 
With the dollar, U.S. bond yields and expected path of U.S. interest rates all moving sharply higher since last week's U.S. presidential election, the threat to global financial stability is rising too.
The BIS acts as a forum for major central banks.
The dollar on Monday hit its highest level of the year against the euro  and a basket of major currencies (DXY), and on Tuesday an eight-year high against the Chinese yuan . 
Since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, a stronger dollar has become more closely associated with increasing deviations in covered interest parity, Shin's research shows, and less so with the VIX. 
Traditionally, when the VIX is low, leverage is high as banks feel emboldened to borrow and lend more. When the VIX rises, leverage tumbles.
Banks' leverage is at a 25-year low around 18 times, having peaked in 2007 at around 50, and volatility has slumped from crisis peaks thanks to trillions of dollars of central bank stimulus. This would suggest banks are in more robust shape. 
But the sector has struggled with years of low - and even negative - interest rates, flattening yield curves and tighter regulation limiting their ability to expand their balance sheets. 
The VIX/leverage relationship has broken down, while banks and market participants in Europe and Japan - where interest rates and yields are negative - have hoovered up the higher-yielding U.S. counterpart for investment or hedging purposes.
Non-U.S. dollar borrowing around the world and exposure to dollar-denominated assets has risen, meaning a growing base of investors, banks and financial market participants is exposed to an appreciation in the currency. 

Counterintuitively, European banks are potentially the most exposed, because they lend more dollars to borrowers in Asia than U.S. banks do, Shin said.

Investors are currently pricing an 81.1% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting; according to federal funds futures tracked Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Expectations for higher rates typically boost the dollar by making it more attractive to yield seeking investors.
Many investors also believe that Trump's campaign pledges to increase fiscal spending, cut taxes and loosen financial regulation will lead to a pickup in economic growth and inflation.
Faster growth and inflation would also prompt the Fed to tighten monetary policy a faster rate than had previously been expected.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2016 10:40PM ET</span>",Mexico says has tools to fight financial volatility,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has an array of tools to face down financial volatility in the wake of the U.S. presidential election, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said on Monday, after Donald Trump's victory sent the peso currency  into a tailspin.
The government can use a windfall stemming from the Mexican central bank's foreign exchange gains on the peso, as well as some 110 billion pesos ($5.3 billion) in its oil stabilization fund, to ensure public finances are stable, Meade said.
""And we're facing this situation with well-capitalized banks,"" Meade said at an event in the central city of Puebla.
Trump's win sparked fears because of threats he made in the campaign to dump the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if he could not recast it in the United States' favor, sending the peso to a record low of more than 21 per dollar.
NAFTA is a pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico, which sends 80 percent of its goods exports to the U.S. market.
Meade also noted the Mexican government had refinanced its 2017 debt maturities, meaning it can cover its financing requirements for next year in the domestic market.
""Mexico's public debt ... is something we are revising and discussing with the market,"" the minister said.
Speaking earlier at the same event, Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said he was sure Trump would not ditch NAFTA and noted that new chapters should be added to the trade deal to reflect economic changes over the past 20 years.
An updated NAFTA could cover e-commerce, protection of data and intellectual property in biotech medicine, promoting value chains at small- and medium-sized firms and taking a regional stand against unfair practices such as steel dumping, he added.
Mexico has in recent months slapped tariffs on Chinese steel imports, and one of Trump's top trade advisers, Dan DiMicco, former chief executive of U.S. steelmaker  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE), has pointedly criticized China for dumping cheap steel on the world market.
If Mexico and the United States were to align policies on such issues it would chime with trade experts arguing for the NAFTA partners to pursue a more regional approach to safeguarding the competitiveness of North America.
Guajardo himself spoke of the need to defend the NAFTA region in an interview with Reuters last week.

USD/JPY changed hands at 107.38, up 0.66%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7549, up 0.07%, reversing an earlier slight decline.
China said fixed asset investment for October rose 8.3%, beating the 8.2% rise seen year-on-year and industrial production gained 6.1%, below the expected 6.2% rise seen and retail sales increased 10.0%, below the 10.7% increase seen. The numbers suggest, as China's National Bureau of Statistics said, that the foundation of economic recovery is not yet solid and there are still too many uncertainties. With Beijing shifting focus to risk prevention and less policy easing expected in the period ahead, growth looks likely to slow again in the first half next year.
Japan also said industrial production for September month-on-month rose 0.6%, better than the unchanged forecast by analysts.
Earlier, Japan reported third quarter GDP jumped 0.5% quarter-on-quarter and at a 2.2% pace year-on-year, handily beating expected gains of 0.2% and 0.9% respectively. Economists expect Japan's economy to post continued modest growth in the final quarter of 2016, backed by a pickup in consumer sentiment and increased public works projects in the government's stimulus package.
Separately, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday urged companies to hike wages in line with the central bank's 2% sustained inflation target and said fiscal and monetary measures will remain keys to boosting the economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a nine-month high against a basket of major currencies on Monday, riding climbing U.S. yields and seen to be at the cusp of a renewed bull phase following Donald Trump's U.S. election win.
The dollar index was up 0.4 percent at 99.471 after touching 99.680, its highest since Jan. 29.
The greenback has soared on expectations that Trump's administration would boost spending and lift inflation, which spurred an elevation of Treasury yields.
The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to a 10-month high of 2.2 percent in Asia.
""What was expected to be a gradual dollar rise is going much faster than expected after Trump's win,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo. ""With the possibility of reflationary policies being enacted, the market is bracing for a new bull phase under a different set of rules."" 
""While the dollar rise before the U.S. election was driven to a large degree by speculators unwinding their positions, this phase is more conducive for participants to go long on the dollar anew,"" he said. 
Trump's victory has lifted the cloud of risk aversion in equity markets such as the United States and Japan, giving the dollar a big leg-up against the safe-haven yen. The Dow closed at a record high on Friday, while the Nikkei was up 1.5 percent on Monday.
The dollar was up 0.8 percent at 107.500 yen, having risen to 107.595, its highest since June 7. It had slumped to 101.190 on Wednesday in an initial reaction to Trump's win.
""It is probably a good idea to keep riding the dollar higher while the Trump camp has not yet revealed any specific policy steps,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The euro could be more easily exposed to negative pressure amid concerns that the win by Trump, with his anti-globalism agenda, could affect referendums and elections in Italy, Holland and France next year.""
The euro was down 0.6 percent at $1.0793 after touching $1.0773, its lowest since early January.
Against the Swiss franc the dollar gained 0.4 percent to 0.9914 franc.
The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.7548 after seeing a one-month low of $0.7524. The New Zealand dollar was down 0.5 percent at $0.7092 as the market waited to see the economic impact of earthquakes that struck the country.
The Aussie had dropped about 1.6 percent and the kiwi shed more than 3 percent last week against a broadly stronger dollar.
Currencies associated with the Trans Pacific Partnership, (TPP) such as the Aussie and kiwi, came under additional pressure after news on Friday that Trump's election had effectively rendered the trade deal a non-starter for the U.S. Congress.
Trump had made opposition to the TPP a centerpiece of his election campaign.
The pound, which stood its ground against the dollar last week, took a step back. Sterling was down 0.3 percent at $1.2566. 
It hit a five-week high of $1.2673 last week as market focus turned away from Brexit towards potential political risks in Europe, amid expectations that Trump's win could strengthen Britain's ties with the United States.
Emerging currencies including the South Korean won, Indonesian rupiah and Singapore dollar remained on the defensive, weighed down by the specter of investor money being siphoned away by higher U.S. rates.
The Mexican peso, however, pulled back from a record low of 21.39 pesos per dollar touched Friday to 20.76 as Trump appeared to soften one of his controversial campaign pledges.

The U.S. president-elect watered down his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, saying some areas could instead be ""fencing"".

The peso , the world's worst-performing currency this year, has fallen to record lows after Trump's election upset last week on fears he may look to decrease trade and build a wall between the two countries, while also deporting about 11 million people living illegally in the United States. 
On Sunday, Trump backed away from his promise to erect a border wall, saying some areas could instead be ""fencing,"" and added he would move to deport up to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally who have criminal records.
Trump's win has hit Mexican assets hard, with the peso plunging to a record-low of more than 21 pesos per dollar, leading analysts to lower their economic growth forecasts for the country. 
So far, Mexican authorities have declined to intervene to stem the peso's losses, a move most analysts had expected. The central bank holds its next meeting on Thursday.
On Friday, Finance Minster Jose Antonio Meade said the government might be ready to design new currency intervention mechanisms, which it would create alongside the central bank and announce when the time was right.

The central bank maintains that the peso depreciation's pass-through to inflation has so far been mild.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's beleaguered peso  weakened further on Friday, hitting a fresh record low over 21 pesos per dollar in a volatile session, with Donald Trump's shock U.S. election win continuing to weigh and some forecasting further declines. 
The peso  has become a lightning rod for market anxiety due to fears about the future of Mexican-U.S. trade relations. Trump has vowed to build a border wall between Mexico and the United States, and threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The peso was down 3.15 percent to trade at 21.24 pesos per dollar around 10 a.m.(11 a.m. EST) on Friday. The dollar has gained nearly 13 percent against the peso this month. 
Trump's presidential win has smashed Mexican assets, which are still reeling after the surprise victory on Tuesday, and has led analysts to lower forecasts on Mexico's economic performance.
""Even assuming no trade tariffs, we think that a mix of heightened uncertainty, a weaker peso – leading to higher inflation – and significantly tighter monetary policy will weigh on the Mexican economy,"" Oxford Economics said in a note, adding that it lowered its 2017 and 2018 growth forecasts to 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, from 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent growth previously.
However, some felt it could be an opportune moment to snap up Mexican assets.
""We are taking advantage of the volatility. For example, in the case of Mexico, it looks like a great opportunity to buy stocks and the currency is down dramatically ... generally speaking this provides a great opportunity,"" Templeton's Mark Mobius said on CNBC. 
So far, Mexican authorities have declined to intervene to stem the peso's losses, a move most analysts had expected, choosing instead to wait until next week's central bank meeting.
""At current juncture we have conviction that the situation might get worse before stabilizing (blame it also on the erratic communication and dogmatic approach from Banxico),""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said in a note. 
Oxford Economics said it expected the Banco de Mexico to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at the Nov. 17 meeting, and by an additional 75 basis points next year. 

The peso, the world's worst performing currency this year, took its biggest two-day tumble in more than 20 years following Trump's victory, while Mexican stocks (MXX) diverged from rallying U.S. equities for a second day on Thursday, losing nearly 5 percent.

462,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2016 08:08AM ET</span>","Dollar heads for best week in a year, Mexican peso sinks","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was set for its best week in a year on Friday, extending gains against the yuan and Mexican peso on concerns emerging markets could suffer most if President-elect Donald Trump turns his protectionist rhetoric into actions.
Traditional safe havens for investors' money, the yen and the Swiss franc, recovered some of this week's losses against the greenback, however, as markets worried about the global consequences of such a policy shift and of higher U.S. inflation.
Expectations of rising U.S. price pressures if Trump delivers on promises to boost public spending and put barriers on cheap imports have driven Treasury yields higher and boosted the dollar since his victory on Tuesday. 
The gains have come almost across the board, with the exception of a recovering British pound and, in morning trade in Europe, the dollar was another 0.1 percent higher against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength.
There are doubts whether the momentum will continue into next week, and gains were focused on the two currencies that would be expected to suffer most from U.S. trade tariffs, protectionism and immigration controls.
China fixed the yuan another 0.2 percent lower at 6.8120 per dollar and less-tightly controlled offshore rates reached as high as 6.85, pointing to expectations of more losses. The peso  sank 3 percent to a record low of 21.395 per dollar. 
""Emerging markets to the sword is the chatter,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency managers Millennium Global in London. 
""The question is whether the bond rout that we've seen lasts next week. It is pretty hard for U.S. stocks to keep rising when emerging is getting whacked, or for the dollar to perform against the yen if risk assets come under proper pressure.""
BULLISH GOLDMAN
The dollar dipped 0.4 percent from highs of close to 107 yen hit on Thursday. It was marginally stronger on the day at 1.0879 per euro, a third of a cent off the previous session's 3-1/2 month high.
The greenback, however, was still set to end the week with a more than 3 percent rise against its Japanese peer. It has gained almost double that from lows hit on U.S. election night before it became clear Trump was heading for victory. 
Analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), forced to trim one of the market's best-known bullish dollar calls earlier this year, said in a note overnight they expected the greenback to add to its gains. 
""Many (are) asking if dollar strength in recent days can extend,"" they said. ""We think so and see the election as something of a 'reset'.""
Goldman are among those who have called for a rise to parity with the euro. The note gave no details of current forecasts. 
The fast pace of the dollar's appreciation against the yen prompted a response from Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso, usually known to make statements when the currency pair moves in the opposite direction. 
""It is exceptional for the yen to move 5 yen (against the dollar) in two days,"" he told reporters, stressing the importance of market stability.
The New Zealand dollar remained on the back foot after the country's central bank cut interest rates on Wednesday. The kiwi slipped 0.2 percent to $0.7198 , poised to lose nearly 2 percent this week.

The Australian dollar, sensitive to swings in risk appetite, was down 0.2 percent at $0.7598  and on track for a 1 percent weekly drop.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2016 03:19AM ET</span>",Asia struggles on forex and flows after Trump win,"By Saikat Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - There is much uncertainty in Asia over what U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will do when he takes office next year, but markets seem sure of two things – his policies will be inflationary, and there are unlikely to be any big winners in the trade-driven region.
U.S. Treasury bond yields have surged to their highest levels since January on expectations Trump's spending promises will push U.S. inflation higher, and emerging Asian currencies have fallen, partly because uncertainty always prompts a flight to safer assets, but also because Trump's campaign rhetoric has stoked fears of a more protectionist trade environment.
""As the global opportunity cost of capital rises alongside Treasury yields, and as the dollar surges simultaneously, investors once again will fear another exodus of capital from emerging markets,” Citi analysts said in a report, noting that the U.S. 10-year treasury yield has risen by 45 basis points in less than two days on expectations of expansionary fiscal policy.
The effect is already being felt in Asia. The Malaysian ringgit fell more than 5 percent against the dollar in the offshore market on Friday, prompting a blowout in spreads and forcing the central bank to limit offshore-based transactions to check the slide.
The Indonesian rupiah <IDR=> has also come under selling pressure, prompting authorities to sell dollars to stabilize it.
Hong Kong and Singapore, Asia's two city-state trading hubs, are among the most exposed, however, not only because of their big trade links with the United States, but also their use of the dollar in policymaking. Hong Kong has a direct currency peg with the greenback, while Singapore uses a currency basket in which the dollar forms a substantial component.
""Trump's fiscal and pro-business policies will lead to higher inflation and interest rates, putting Singapore and Hong Kong at the front and center for any adjustment,"" said a portfolio manager at a U.S. firm in Hong Kong.
Not only is a rising U.S. dollar equivalent to tightening monetary conditions in those cities, but if the Federal Reserve raises rates faster than had been expected, it will drain the cheap funding that has kept emerging markets flush with cash.
PROTECTIONIST PROSPECTS?
Corporate leverage within Asia now accounts for half of the region's debt to GDP, and companies in China and India have taken on the most debt, according to bond giant, PIMCO.
Moreover, rising interest rates on U.S. debt will erode the relative appeal of higher-yielding debt in Asian countries, causing an outflow of capital.
For example, the yield gap between 10-year U.S. debt and a simple average of the three highest yielding countries in Asia - India, China and Indonesia - has narrowed by 41 basis points to 350 basis points in just two days.
Taiwan and Indonesia have seen the biggest capital inflows so far this year, at more than $10 billion each, according to economists at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which makes them most vulnerable to a rapid reversal.
""We have started to see some reversal to the large inflows into Asian equities and debt in the last few days, but it would be difficult to say at this point whether it is sustainable,"" said Jonathan Garner, chief Asia and emerging market equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), who expects a further 5 percent downside to the emerging markets equity index from current levels.
Beyond the immediate market impact, there is another risk overshadowing much of Asia; how will Trump keep his campaign promises to rework trade deals and punish countries such as China?
While exports to the United States from Asia excluding China have fallen steadily in the last 15 years, China still accounts for half of the U.S. trade deficit with the world, and any signs that Trump might follow through with protectionist policies could trigger a currency war.
On Friday, Beijing fixed the yuan's daily midpoint at a six-year low, but on a trade-weighted basis it still remains near an all-time high hit last year.
Some economists say pursuing more protectionist policies may play into China’s hands to promote the use of its currency in international trade.

“The RMB internationalization drive may receive a boost if the U.S. becomes more isolationist and China’s political standing increases,” said Mark McFarland, Asia chief economist at Union Bancaire Privee.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2016 01:50PM ET</span>",Mexican peso's massive slump deepens after Trump win,"By Michael O'Boyle
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso sank again on Thursday, taking its biggest two-day tumble in more than 20 years as investors worried about how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies could hit exports from Latin America's No. 2 economy. 
The peso  lost more than 3 percent to trade around 20.51 per dollar. That follows a major slump on Wednesday during a sell-off after Trump's unexpected victory. [nL1N1DA0TZ]
The dollar has gained around 12 percent against the peso in the last two days, one of its biggest ever slumps since a 1994-1995 devaluation.
During his campaign, Trump vowed to rewrite or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement on grounds that it favored Mexico at the expense of U.S. workers. He has also said he would tax the money sent home from the United States by Mexican migrants, to pay for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) strategist Dirk Willer said he expected the peso, long a bellwether for investor sentiment about the U.S. election, to keep weakening and range between 21 and 22 per dollar until it is clear what trade policies Trump will enact.
""It will be very hard for the peso to rally until you get some clarity on whether Trump really means business,"" Willer said. 
In the run-up to the election, a Reuters poll had forecast a Trump victory would knock the peso to around 21 per dollar.
Mexico chose not to intervene to stem peso losses the morning after Trump's victory, a move many analysts had expected, although the central bank may raise interest rates next week for the fourth time this year.
Nonetheless, on Thursday, Mexico's finance ministry said it would cut the amount of long-term peso bonds it would offer during the rest of the fourth quarter due to the increase in market volatility. [nE1N1D800N]
The finance ministry said it would cut issuance of fixed-rate and inflation-linked 10-year and 30-year peso bonds during the rest of the year, while it would increase the amount of short-term peso debt it offers in its weekly auctions.
The dollar has strengthened about 19 percent against the peso this year, even more than a nearly 17 percent gain for all of 2015.
During the last decade, the peso, as the most liquid emerging market currency, has been a proxy bet for all emerging markets and risky investments like stocks. 
But the peso diverged for the second day in a row as stocks rose in the United States (SPX), Mexico's top trading partner.

If Trump increases tariffs on Mexican imports into the United States as he promised during the campaign, it could impede growth for the Latin American country's economy.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sentiment toward most emerging Asian currencies remained bearish in the last two weeks and is unlikely to recover soon as Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election adds to concerns about the region's exports and ties with Washington, a Reuters poll showed.
While the dollar initially weakened on signs that Trump was sweeping to power, it later rebounded on the back of higher U.S. Treasury yields, souring appetite for the regional currencies, according to the survey of 17 fund managers, analysts and currency traders conducted between Tuesday and Thursday.
Most of the participants provided their estimates after Trump started moving ahead of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in key battleground states, including Florida and Ohio.
The Chinese yuan likely saw smaller bearish bets, but pessimistic positions were not much different from a near 10-month high posted two weeks ago.
The yuan hit fresh six-year lows on Thursday as the central bank set its daily guidance rate weaker for a fifth straight session.
China's exports and imports in October fell more than expected, casting doubts over sustainability of a pick-up in the world's second-largest economy.
OUTFLOWS, POLITICS HIT WON
The South Korean won suffered the largest bearish bets in 5-1/2 months on capital outflows and a deepening political crisis surrounding President Park Geun-hye.
Last month, the country reported 3.6 trillion won ($3.1 billion) worth of bond outflows, the largest since February, as a large chunk of the securities came to maturity, a financial regulator data showed.
Foreign investors also sold a combined net 906.6 billion won worth of equities over the previous six consecutive sessions in Seoul's main bourse KS11, according to the Korea Exchange.
Park's presidency has been rocked by allegations that a friend of hers used her ties to meddle in state affairs and wield improper influence.
The Malaysian ringgit <MYR=MY> posted the largest short positions since late May. The ringgit fell to its weakest in more than nine months as the government bond prices <0#MYBMK=> lost ground.
Bearish bets on the Philippine peso <PHP=PDSP> grew again to the largest since mid-October as foreign investors sold Manila stocks (PSI). The peso on Wednesday hit a seven-year low.
Sentiment on the Indonesian rupiah <IDR=ID> turned bearish first time since late May, as foreign investors trimmed some of bond holdings.
By contrast, bullish bets on the Indian rupee <INR=D2> slightly rose as the country's move to withdraw larger banknotes from circulation was seen as a positive for the economy, improving transparency and leading to easing inflation.
The poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar <SGD=D3>, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar <TWD=TP>, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht <THB=TH>.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

477,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2016 12:50AM ET</span>",Japan should not hesitate to act if yen spikes rapidly: Ex-MOF Watanabe,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Yoshifumi Takemoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan should not hesitate to intervene in currency markets if the yen spikes rapidly, even if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump opposes such a move, the country's former top currency diplomat Hiroshi Watanabe said on Thursday.
Watanabe made the remark a day after the Republican nominee's surprise win in the presidential election roiled global markets.
The yen surged more than 3 percent on Wednesday as Trump swept to victory over heavily favored rival Hillary Clinton, prompting verbal warnings from Japanese policymakers who are concerned that a strong currency would derail the fragile export-reliant economy.
Markets were calmer on Thursday, with the dollar reversing earlier selling against the safe-haven yen to touch a high of 105.87 yen, its highest since July 27.
""If the yen spikes by 3 yen or more, Japan should not hesitate to intervene"" regardless of U.S. concerns about such action, Watanabe told Reuters in an interview, adding that he told this recently to Finance Minister Taro Aso and current top financial diplomat Masatsugu Asakawa.
""If Japan hesitated to intervene out of deference (to Trump), it would not be able to act for the coming four years,"" said Watanabe, who is now president of the Institute for International Monetary Affairs, a private think tank.
Japan has not intervened in currency markets since Nov. 2011. 
Watanabe served as vice finance minister for international affairs for three years to 2007, and has a close network with policymakers in and outside of Japan.
He said Japan-U.S. economic ties won't change much under Trump, shrugging off some concerns about trade friction.
Japan does not export as much to the United States as it used to, and Japanese carmakers are boosting direct investment and creating jobs there, he noted.
For now, Watanabe said the yen is likely to weaken slowly as the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to go ahead with an interest rate hike in December or January, supporting the dollar.
Turning to the Bank of Japan, Watanabe said as long as the economy grows steadily, he saw no need for the central bank to ease already massive monetary stimulus further barring big shocks to financial markets.

""I don't think further easing would help much to spur flagging consumer prices,"" Watanabe said, adding that the BOJ should not be fixated on hitting its elusive 2 percent inflation target.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 11:34PM ET</span>",Dollar tries to stabilize after wild swings on Trump upset,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Thursday as traders sought some stability after 24 hours of high drama in global markets that saw a massive selloff in risk assets and an equally dramatic turnaround on Republican Donald Trump's shock U.S. presidential win. 
With market uncertainty running deep over what a Trump presidency might mean for economic policy, traders quickly latched on to talk that the new administration will usher in higher economic growth and inflation, sending U.S. bond yields surging overnight. 
The dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 105.40  in choppy trade that took it to a session low of 104.99 from a high of 105.95, its loftiest level since July 27. 
It had sunken as low as 101.19 yen on Wednesday, as Trump's victory became more apparent and risk assets plunged, stoking demand for the perceived safe-haven Japanese currency. 
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury debt (US10YT=RR) fell back in Asian trading to 1.995 percent, compared to its U.S. close of 2.064 percent on Wednesday. 
Prices fell on 10-year Treasury notes and 30-year bonds on Wednesday, pushing yields to their highest levels in 10 months in a dramatic about-face from the massive risk asset selloff on Trump's stunning upset. [U/S]
Speculation in markets that Trump would enact protectionist trade policies and put upward pressure on U.S. wages and boostinflation helped lift U.S. bond yields.
""The U.S. yield curve showed expectations for something similar to Reaganomics in the 1980's, when there was huge fiscal stimulus and a little bit of monetary tightening,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""But today's Tokyo session's action is very natural to me. Market participants recognize that some Trump risk remains, and the market should be ready for risk-off sentiment to return, which is why U.S. Treasury yields dropped back below 2 percent,"" he said.
Other market participants cited selling by Japanese exporters, who were absent from the previous day's Asian trading session when the yen surged.
Trump stated during the campaign that he would spend more on developing U.S. infrastructure, which could increase the U.S. budget deficit and Treasury supply. Trump also will take office with Republican majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress that could help him implement his legislative agenda. 
""U.S. yields were part of the reason for the dollar's rise, but there was also a lot of 'buy the rumor, sell the fact' and unwinding of the 'Trump trade,' after it played out, and a return to fundamentals,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
Investors still expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its December policy meeting, after being on hold since hiking rates in December 2015.
About 85 percent of 62 respondents in a survey taken on Wednesday after the shock vote said the Fed would go ahead with a rate rise, its first in a year. Forecasts came from several of the Wall Street primary dealers as well as European analysts.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari on Wednesday said he sees continued sluggish growth ahead for the U.S. economy, unless lawmakers and the president ""get going"" on policies to boost productivity and population.
The euro spiked as high as $1.1299  on Wednesday, its highest since Sept. 8, before tumbling to $1.0902. It last stood at $1.0926, up 0.2 percent.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly higher on the day at 98.523 (DXY) after rising to an overnight high of 98.704, its highest since Oct. 28.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 10:40PM ET</span>",Yuan slips as dollar recovers but wary over Trump's China intentions,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's yuan fell to fresh six-year lows against the U.S. dollar on Thursday after the central bank set a weaker midpoint for the fifth consecutive day to reflect a sharp rebound in the dollar overnight.
Traders and analysts said uncertainties over the yuan's direction have increased after Republican Donald Trump's surprise presidential election on Wednesday. 
Trump had lambasted China throughout the election campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator in his first day in office.
The People's Bank of China set the yuan's midpoint rate  at 6.7885 per dollar prior to the market open, weaker than the previous fix of 6.7832. 
In the spot market, the yuan  opened at 6.7980 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.7906 at midday, 129 pips away from the previous late session close and 0.03 percent away from the midpoint. 
""Trump's win has added to uncertainties over the yuan and whether the Fed will increase interest rates in December. Whether the yuan will continue to depreciate has a lot to do with Fed's rate decision,"" said Raymond Yeung, ANZ's chief economist of greater China.
""In the long run, the yuan still faces depreciation pressure, but China's central bank has tools to stabilize it.""
There is a chance that a ""lose-lose"" situation for the U.S. and China can be avoided, but if Trump imposed the threatened tariffs and Beijing retaliated, there could be substantial volatility in global markets and additional depreciation pressures on the yuan, HSBC analysts said in a report.
The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index (RXYH), which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, stood at 94.62, firmer than the previous day's 94.36. 
The offshore yuan was trading -0.29 percent weaker than the onshore spot at 6.8103 per dollar. 
Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts (NDFs), considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan's value, traded at 6.976, -2.69 percent away from the midpoint.

One-year NDFs are settled against the midpoint, not the spot rate.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 12:40PM ET</span>","Fed worries aside, Trump presidency may bode well for dollar","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - It took just over eight hours on Wednesday for currency markets to abandon the prevailing logic of the past month - that a Donald Trump presidency would be bad for the dollar against its major peers.
As forecast by dozens of bank and fund strategists, the greenback sank against the yen on the first signs, deep in the U.S. night, of a victory that they worry carries huge risks for global growth, security and trade.
Trading volumes against the euro reached 10 times the average for what is normally a high point of trading in Japan and Hong Kong, and Tokyo felt the need to caution speculators with the promise of an emergency meeting of officials to consider intervention.
But by the time daylight returned in New York, investors had pushed the dollar back to a loss of just half a percent on the day against the Japanese currency, and it was up against the euro and the franc.
A number of major banks including HSBC issued notes in London highlighting the immediate risks to the currency, yet none went as far as altering their longer-term forecasts.
French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) recommended buying the U.S. currency at 103 yen with a target of 110. Some bigger financial houses including Citi said they should have more to say over the next 24 hours.
The reticence spoke to far greater doubt over whether Trump's promised anti-establishment policy mix will do anything other than support the greenback, broadly by drawing capital back into the United States and administering economic pain elsewhere.
""Medium to long-term implications are extremely difficult to assess because there is plenty of uncertainty about the extent to which Donald's Trump program and pre-election announcements can be implemented,"" analysts from Unicredit (MI:CRDI) said in a note.
""(But) we are currently looking closely at developments and will likely put a number of our forecasts under revision.""
FED PREMIUM EVAPORATES
Predictions the dollar would fall were based largely on the premise that the shock to global markets of a Trump victory would worry Federal Reserve policymakers next month enough to stay their hand on a long promised rise in interest rates.
As stock markets recovered, those thoughts were quickly evaporating, the priced likelihood of a move next month back above 70 percent - a level at which the Fed has been comfortable delivering in the past.
""The Fed rate hike is back on, even with Trump in the White House,"" said Kathleen Brooks, head of research with brokers City Index in London.
""Perhaps Trump's conciliatory tone in his victory speech has eased concerns, or perhaps markets have no idea how to price in his victory as we have no precedent. Either way, a mere 24 hours ago no one would have predicted such a calm market reaction.""
George Saravelos,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s main strategist in London, saw no reason to back off forecasts that have consistently been among the most bullish on the dollar of the big global banks who have dominated currency trading in the past decade.
Like a number of others, he points to the potential for repatriation of corporate funds under a new tax holiday and Trump's promises of a boost to U.S. public spending.
""On the one hand you've got the positive fiscal story and then the corporate tax reform that might involve substantial repatriation,"" he said. ""(That is) a pretty consistent message that is dollar positive.""
UNTAXED OFFSHORE WEALTH
Both the Republican Trump and his Democratic foe Hillary Clinton had pledged before the election to take steps that would spur major U.S. companies to bring home more of the estimated $2.1 trillion in as-yet-untaxed income they hold offshore.
The Republican party's retention of majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives elections only makes more likely a repeat of George W. Bush's Homeland Investment Act, which brought in roughly $300 billion in funds a decade ago and drove the dollar higher.
There is still an argument over how much impact it would have on the currency now, particularly given that the accounts of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others suggest much of that cash is already held in dollars. But it has continuously popped up in currency market chatter since the summer.
""The fact that U.S. corporations hold larger cash piles offshore than ever is a reason why a new repatriation tax holiday could be a bigger boost for the dollar than in 2005,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a report in July.
""Though we stress the headline number for offshore earnings overstates the unhedged foreign currency amount, which is relevant for FX markets.""
Against the yen, however, Deutsche's Saravelos offered a note of caution. If Trump is to impose trade barriers on China and others, he said, then capital currently lodged in those markets may seek the traditional security of Japan.
""We just have the yen doing better than everything else on the back of the disruption this is going to cause to Asia. We have the yen at 94 per dollar by the end of the year.""

490,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 03:07AM ET</span>",Mexico peso sinks to life lows as Trump wins U.S. presidency in upset,"By Michael O'Boyle and Noe Torres
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican peso collapsed after Republican Donald Trump defied predictions and beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to take the U.S. presidency early on Wednesday in a maverick victory that wreaked havoc in global markets.
Trump's threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and tax money sent home by migrants to pay for building a wall on the southern U.S. border once elected president have made the peso particularly reactive to events in the race for the White House.
The peso <MXN=D2> weakened by more than 13 percent in after-market trading for Mexico and in Wednesday trading in Asia, breaking past 20 pesos per dollar - its biggest fall since the 1994 Tequila Crisis.
The peso pared losses to trade around 10.17 percent weaker at 20.18 per dollar early on Wednesday, after Clinton conceded to Trump in a phone call. Mexico's central bank has called a joint press conference with the Finance Ministry for 0700 local time (0800 EST/1300GMT).
""There's a lot of panic in the market, it is definitely an outcome it was not expecting,"" said Juan Carlos Alderete, a strategist at Banorte-IXE. ""The movements are very strong, the market is showing higher risk aversion in search of safe-haven assets.""
Three economists told Reuters they expected the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate by an impromptu 75 to 150 basis points on Wednesday if Trump wins, while one of them said the bank could instead opt for a swap with the U.S. Federal Reserve pending how the peso evolves.
""I don’t think a Trump scenario was taken seriously in the last days by the market. Hopefully there are some contingency plans by authorities and they can take measures to protect the Mexican economy,"" said Ernesto Revilla, an economist at Banamex and the government's former chief economist.
Mexican central bank head Agustin Carstens last week said the country was ready in case of an ""adverse"" result in the U.S. election, which he has said could hit Mexico like a ""hurricane.""
Mexico has foreign reserves of $175.3 billion, and Carstens said last month he would consider using a $90 billion International Monetary Fund flexible credit line ""in the event of an external shock.""
The central bank has already hiked its rate three times this year, lifting it to 4.75 percent to anchor inflation expectations following a sharp depreciation of the peso.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Mexican currency had rallied nearly 1.4 percent before official election results began to be released, as final polls showed a Clinton advantage.
Volatility in the Mexican peso surged to its highest level since the global financial crisis in 2008. One-month implied volatility, which measures the currency's anticipated trading range over the period, jumped to 40 percent from 27 percent late Tuesday <MXN1MO=>.
""This is truly a historic moment. I don't recall such an extreme outlook on the U.S. economy that could be so negative to the Mexican economy,"" said Benito Berber, an analyst at Nomura in New York.

Berber said a Trump win could drive the peso to between 23 and 26 per dollar.

EUR/USD rallied 1.58% to 1.1200, the highest since September 8.
Markets were pricing in a Trump victory after the Republican candidate took the lead in the bellweather states of North Carolina, Ohio and Florida.
His opponent and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was the projected winner in Nevada and Virginia.
In the states of Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Michigan, Maine and Arizona, the votes were still too close to call.
The Mexican peso plummeted to record lows following the news, with MXN/USD down 8.61% at 0.0048.
Mexico’s central bank was expected by analysts to raise its benchmark interest rate by between 75 and 150 basis points in an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday if Trump wins.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY plummeted 2.66% to 102.35.
Japan reiterated its readiness to intervene in currency markets on Wednesday morning. The country’s Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday that Tokyo will need to respond to moves in the currency markets if the U.S. election results cause a sudden spike in the yen.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 12:30AM ET</span>",Dollar tanks as Trump takes lead in fiercely fought U.S. election,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled more than three percent against the yen while the Mexican peso sank to a record low on Wednesday, as Republican Donald Trump took a shocking lead in the fiercely-contested U.S. election.
The probability of a Trump win, which appeared inconceivable to many just a few months ago, put the markets into full risk-aversion mode, sending investors scurrying out of the dollar and into perceived safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The euro and sterling also rallied versus the greenback. 
Trump scored a series of surprising wins in battleground states including Florida and Ohio, opening a path to the White House for the political outsider and rattling world markets counting on a win by Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The dollar slumped 3.8 percent to 101.210 yen  in a volatile day that saw it rise to 105.480 earlier, when last-minute opinion polls put Clinton in favor.
The dollar fell 2.3 percent against the Swiss franc, another safe-haven, to 0.9552 franc . The euro rallied 2.5 percent to a two-month high of $1.1300 .
""The catalyst behind the dollar's slide was reports that put Trump ahead of Clinton in the battleground state of Florida,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""Risk aversion is in the air with equities tumbling.""
The Mexican peso, which has served as a barometer of the markets' expectations for a Trump presidency, handed back earlier gains and tumbled down versus the dollar. The peso weakened more than 13 percent to an all-time low of 20.75 pesos per dollar. 
The scene was reminiscent of the turmoil that engulfed global financial markets after the June Brexit vote, when British voters opted to leave the European Union in a decision that wrongfooted investors and bookmakers. [MKTS/GLOB]
""No one in the market expected the results that we're seeing so far,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo. 
""Even if in the case there is a Clinton comeback and she wins, the market already has reacted to the point where the dollar would have trouble climbing back. It's mostly algo dealing in the market now, with dealers staying out. It's system trading, and it's hard for anyone to catch up.""
The markets paid little heed as Japan's top currency diplomat signaled Tokyo's readiness to intervene in currencies as the yen soared.
""(Currency) moves are quite rough,"" Masatsugu Asakawa, vice finance minister for international affairs, told reporters, adding that he was watching markets with a ""sense of urgency.""
Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, a move that could damage the economies of the export-heavy U.S. neighbors.
The Canadian dollar  fell to an eight-month low of C$1.3525 per dollar.
Investor anxiety has deepened in recent weeks on the prospect of a Trump victory as the controversial businessman, an anti-establishment political novice, is seen as a risk to global growth as he has pledged to renegotiate trade deals, impose high import tariffs and stirred fears of a currency war with China.
The Republican candidate has also stoked uncertainty over his stance in foreign policy and immigration, while Clinton is seen by markets as a known entity and likely to ensure political and financial stability.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2016 07:23PM ET</span>",Dollar edges up as markets see higher odds of Clinton win,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar tiptoed higher early on Wednesday, adding to overnight gains, as markets put a higher chance on Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the U.S. presidential election.
The prospect of a victory by Republican Donald Trump took a knock with a projection that Clinton could take the key swing state of Florida. Overnight, data firm VoteCastr favored the Democrat candidate in a number of key battleground states.
The Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar rose against the U.S. dollar on improved bets for a Clinton victory.
The two currencies, particularly the peso, had suffered deep losses when the likelihood of a Trump victory appeared higher. Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, a move that could damage the economies of the export-heavy nations.
The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 105.200 yen , creeping back toward a three-month high of 105.540 struck late in October. It fell to 102.550 against the yen last week when polls suggested a tightening U.S. election.
The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.1005 , putting further distance from a four-week high of $1.1143 seen on Friday.
The greenback also gained against the Swiss franc, which has also served as a safe-haven along with the yen. The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 0.9815 franc  after slipping to 0.9680 on Friday, the lowest since the end of September.
""We are likely to see currencies swerve up and down today on the state-by-state Electoral College count. The market seems to have priced in a Clinton win quite significantly, but a further improvement in odds of a victory could take dollar/yen to 106,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""But if Trump appears likely to win, dollar/yen could fall toward 100, just as it did after the Brexit vote in June when prior optimism cooled rapidly.""
The markets will keep a particularly close eye on the outcome in battleground states including Florida, Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona.
The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 18.28 Mexican pesos , its weakest in two months. The dollar was steady at C$1.3294  per dollar after losing about 0.6 percent versus its Canadian peer.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in risk appetite, nudged down 0.2 percent to $0.7749 .

Sterling lost 0.15 percent to $1.2365  against a broadly stronger dollar.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2016 10:34AM ET</span>",Dollar rises vs. yen as investors price in expected Clinton win,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc on Tuesday, but was overall little moved as investors bet on victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election that had already been largely priced into the market.
A Trump victory would be expected to drive capital into the perceived security of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Both fell against the dollar in morning trading.
But overall, investors appeared to be consolidating positions after sizeable moves on Monday when the dollar rose about 0.75 percent against six major currencies, its largest one-day percentage gain in nearly a month.
""Everybody’s got their bets on the table,"" said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. ""There hasn’t been any earth-shattering economic data. Things are quiet.""
The dollar, steadily on the rise in recent months, had dipped over 2 percent against a basket of currencies that measures its broader strength in the week following FBI director James Comey's announcement the agency was looking into newly discovered emails related to Clinton's use of a private email server.
Comey said in a letter to Congress on Sunday that the agency's review did not find anything to warrant criminal charges against Clinton. 
Data from exchange-traded funds provider ETF Securities showed its largely retail client base had moved $51 million out of long positions in the dollar, or bets on it to rise, in the past month. Last week's outflow was the biggest since early July, it said.
The dollar index (DXY) was flat on Tuesday at 97.775. It rose 0.35 percent against the yen to 104.81 yen <JPY=> and about 0.15 percent against the Swiss franc  to 0.9755 franc. 
A Trump victory would come as a surprise, but investors were mindful of the precedent set by Britain's referendum on European Union membership in June, which confounded pollsters by delivering a shock vote for Brexit. 
""Versus the yen the market pricing is for a 3-4 percent fall on a surprise outcome,"" said Josh O'Byrne, currency strategist with U.S. bank Citi in London.
""All the volatility is priced on that side ... but it doesn't feel like it will have quite as much of an impact as the Brexit vote, at least for G10 currencies.""

Sterling tumbled more than 10 percent in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2016 09:10AM ET</span>",Egypt to face pain before gain after massive currency devaluation,"By Andrew Torchia
CAIRO (Reuters) - The pain of Egypt's currency devaluation may be felt well before the benefits, creating a period of at least several months in which there is little positive news to offset rising inflation and falling living standards, businessmen and economists say.
By bringing the Egyptian pound down to levels which the markets consider fair value, the devaluation promises to attract fresh capital into the country and end a hard currency shortage that has plagued the economy for years. 
Corporate executives say they will finally be able to make investment decisions based on a transparent, predictable currency market run by banks, rather than an opaque black market in dollars that swung wildly amid profiteering and speculation.
""Before, I used to say we were moving in the dark. We couldn't see because the situation was so blurred. Now at least we have the lights turned on,"" Hani Berzi, chairman of  Edita Food Industries  (CA:EFID), told Reuters.
Despite Egypt's history of street protests since 2011, there is no indication so far that the devaluation will cause significant unrest, and many ordinary Egyptians say they understand the move was inevitable.
But Egypt's other economic problems mean the hoped-for inflows of hard currency may be slow to arrive, at least in the huge volumes required to eliminate the dollar shortage and convince investors that the pound has stabilized.
Red tape, a sluggish bureaucracy and primitive regulation continue to deter foreign investment. The cabinet is expected this month to consider a draft investment law tackling these obstacles, but it could take months to start having an impact.
The government aims to obtain the first $2.5 billion disbursement of a planned $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan as soon as this month. That would be dwarfed by the country's hunger for hard currency, however.
Official data is not available but bankers say privately they believe Egyptian banks need several billion dollars to fill their existing commitments. In addition, unmet commercial demand for dollars is estimated at around $8 billion to $10 billion.
""Filling this demand and ending the dollar shortage will not be the work of days. It will take weeks or months,"" said one Egyptian banker familiar with the currency market.
Regional investment bank Arqaam Capital said the devaluation could bring $12 billion of foreign money into Egypt's bond market and $4.5 billion into equities - but it estimated this might take a year.
A local investment banker said Egypt would avoid one problem often faced by countries after devaluations: an inflated debt burden for companies borrowing abroad. This is because the central bank has prevented local banks from lending in foreign currency unless the borrower earns foreign exchange, he said.
On the other hand, Egypt probably cannot hope for the surge in export receipts that other economies would enjoy after a devaluation, because it is heavily dependent on imports of food as well as components and materials for its industry.
INFLATION
Since the pound's peg of 8.8 to the dollar was abandoned on Thursday, the currency has tumbled to near 17 - by far its largest drop in a series of depreciations over the last 15 years.
The resulting rise in inflation probably won't be as big as the currency's fall, partly because about 90 percent of imported consumer goods were already being paid for at black market currency rates in the months before the devaluation.
Reham El Desoki, senior economist at regional investment bank Arqaam Capital, estimated the devaluation and fuel price hikes introduced last Friday would raise annual inflation to 18-20 percent around the end of this year and a peak of about 22-24 percent next year, from 14.1 percent in September.
The economy has coped with inflation at close to those levels in the past 15 years, Desoki noted. “It is going to be a shock, but I think it is the kind of shock that can be absorbed.”
Nevertheless, the devaluation will eat into the incomes of ordinary Egyptians. Among the middle classes, travel abroad has become harder, students saving to study overseas have seen their plans shattered, and luxury goods have moved out of reach.
For people below the poverty line - more than a quarter of the population of about 91 million, according to the state statistics agency - higher inflation may be much more painful.
There is considerable public anger and dismay at the devaluation but no sign that it will create a serious threat to the government, which has used police to disperse political protests and can count on support from loyal state media. 
However, authorities are under pressure to do more to protect people from the economic reforms. On the day after the currency peg was scrapped, officials said they would boost spending on a consumer subsidy scheme and keep the price of bread flat, even though the devaluation makes it more expensive to import wheat.
That will slow Egypt's drive to cut a huge state budget deficit that totaled 12.2 percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year through last June. 
Partly because of the devaluation, the government could overshoot its 9.8 percent deficit target for the current year by several percentage points, Desoki said.

That may disappoint Egypt's international donors, but they are likely to accept the target being missed as they understand the economy is in a “critical transition phase”, she said.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2016 08:30AM ET</span>",Reuters poll: Sterling trading around ideal rate for UK economy - economists,"By Jonathan Cable and Sumanta Dey
LONDON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Sterling's near 20 percent plunge following Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union has brought the currency to the ideal rate for the UK economy, according to a Reuters poll of economists taken in the past few days.
That plunge, however, has already begun to stoke inflation, posing a challenge for Britons and the Bank of England alike via more expensive imports, with prices of some of Britain's best-known items set to rise in the shops.
The poll also found the BoE, which targets inflation at 2 percent, would stomach it rising from 1 percent currently to 3.5 percent next year before considering changing the neutral stance it only just shifted to from an easing bias last week. 
The range of responses from economists on the central bank's tolerance level for inflation was wide, from 3 to 6 percent. Two-thirds of respondents in the Nov 4-7 poll were based in the United Kingdom.
Several of the usual participants in Reuters polls declined to give a view on the ideal exchange rate, with some saying there wasn't one. Others said how volatile the currency had become was more of an issue than the actual exchange rate.
""There has been evidence that the drop in sterling has helped exporters and manufacturing industries but the uncertainties created by the volatility can negate some of the good effects,"" said Jane Foley at Rabobank.
The pound  traded at $1.24 on Monday, matching the median ideal exchange rate given in the poll. That is well above a three-decade low of $1.145 struck in a flash crash a month ago, but far below $1.50 around the June 23 referendum.
Views on the ideal exchange rate, which is weak enough to support exports on the one hand but not too low to stoke an uncontrollable rise in inflation, ranged from $1.15 to $1.35.
Against the euro (EURGBP=), which matters more for trade as nearly half of Britain's exports to go to the EU, the median ideal rate was 88 pence to the euro, slightly above where it was trading on Monday. Forecasts ranged from 83 to 95 pence.
Last week, sterling rallied almost 3 percent against the dollar but only a bit more than 1 percent against the euro after a British court ruled the government needs parliamentary approval to formally start the process of leaving the EU. 
The better performance against the dollar reflected a sinking U.S. currency on the view Republican candidate Donald Trump had a better chance of taking the presidency in the election on Tuesday. That fall in the dollar came alongside the longest losing streak for Wall Street stocks in 35 years. 
But the pound slid once again on Monday against the dollar as prospects for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton appeared to improve.
Early last week, the Reuters monthly survey of more than 60 dealers found the pound would likely fall to $1.15 after the formal step giving intention to leave the EU, triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, was triggered. [GBP/POLL]
BEATING EXPECTATIONS SO FAR
Britain's economy has so far performed much better than was almost unanimously predicted by economists soon after the referendum and the BoE raised its forecasts for 2017 growth and inflation sharply last week.
GDP expanded a stronger-than-expected 0.5 percent last quarter, tempering fears of an immediate Brexit vote shock, but that pace is predicted to weaken to 0.1 percent this quarter, a Reuters poll found last month. [ECILT/GB]
Yet despite a string of upbeat data and a sharp upward revision by the BoE last week to its near-term view, only 22 of the 41 respondents who answered a separate question said they were considering revising up their Q4 growth forecast.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said she intends to start the formal two-year countdown by end-March but there have been few clues as to what form those talks will take.
Many think May is leaning towards a ""hard Brexit"" - giving up on trying to maintain access to the EU single market in favor of imposing controls on immigration, a move which would hinder trade and further hurt sterling.
""Sterling will be volatile and buffeted around by political moves related to whether we're going to get a hard or a soft Brexit,"" Foley said.
Some foreign exchange analysts noted on Monday that despite the rally last week, traders remain heavily short the pound which could lead to further rallies where traders are forced to buy back pounds they have sold to cover their positions.

""However, as Brexit related uncertainty should continue it seems unlikely that buying interest will rise more considerably from these levels,"" wrote Valentin Marinov, Head of G10 FX Strategy at CA-CIB, in a note to clients early on Monday.

The Mexican currency has been sensitive to developments in the election amid fears that a victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump could damage the country’s economy.
Clinton’s campaign lost momentum last week after the FBI said it was reviewing more emails related to her private email use while she was secretary of state.
A victory for Clinton in Tuesday’s election is expected to be less disruptive for financial markets than a win for Trump and would strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2016 07:18PM ET</span>",Mexico peso jumps after FBI clears Clinton over emails ahead of election,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's peso jumped on Sunday after the FBI announced it stood by a previous decision to not charge Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over emails related to her private server, a decision that comes just two days before the election. 
The peso , which has been hit by the rise of Republican candidate Donald Trump and his policies that are seen hurting Mexico's economy, extended gains to rise 2.25 percent to 18.584 per dollar.
It was the currency's strongest intraday level since Oct. 26.
CME-listed peso futures  surged as electronic trading kicked off on Sunday evening, with the December contract up more than 2 percent at the highest since 0ct. 25. More than 2,800 contracts had traded, which was about triple the volume of trade last Sunday when weekly trading resumed. 
Hedge funds and other speculators had ratcheted up bets against the peso in currency futures and options for the first time in four weeks last week, according to weekly positioning data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission published on Friday.
Big speculators were net short the peso by more than 37,000 contracts, an increase of more than 11,000 contracts from the previous week. Still, that was well off the record short-position in the currency of more than 89,000 contracts from late September.
In a letter to Congress on Sunday announcing the end of a review of newly discovered emails related to Clinton's private server, FBI Director James Comey said the agency had not changed its conclusions from July that no criminal charges were warranted against the presidential contender.
Comey informed Congress of the newly discovered emails more than a week ago, throwing the race for the White House into turmoil and eroding Clinton's lead over Trump in the final stretch before Tuesday's vote.
With just two days to go until the Nov. 8 election, Comey's decision handed a major boost to Clinton, who has been accused of criminality by her rival Trump over her handling of government emails during her time as Secretary of State.

Trump has vowed to build a border wall between Mexico and the United States, threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, block remittances back to Mexico and deport those living illegally in the United States.

TOKYO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The dollar jumped early on Monday after the FBI said a review of newly discovered emails did not change the agency's conclusion that no charges were warranted in the case of Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. 
Markets have tended to see U.S. presidential contender Clinton as the status quo candidate, and news favoring her bid often boosts risk appetite.
The dollar was up 1.1 percent at 104.275 yen  after surging to 104.530 in early trade. It had declined to 102.550 last week as polls showed a tightening U.S. presidential race.
The euro was down 0.5 percent to $1.1089 , knocked off a four-week peak of $1.1143 reached on Friday.
The U.S. currency also won back ground against the Swiss franc , which has served as a safe-haven along with the yen. The dollar was up 0.6 percent at $0.9739 francs after going as high as $0.9789.
""The dollar is being bought back on lessened prospects of a Trump presidency. But so far it is not active buying, as Clinton is likely to maintain a policy that prevents a strong dollar if she is elected, and as economic prospects remain unclear,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""Uncertainty regarding the elections will remain until the last minute, as a significant part of Trump's latest comeback in the polls may not be related to Clinton's e-mail probe."" 
News of the emails had helped Republican Donald Trump narrow Clinton's lead in some polls and unsettle markets globally. There is great uncertainty about what a Trump victory in the Nov. 8 vote might mean for economic policy, free trade and geopolitics.
The Mexican peso has acted as something of a bellwether of sentiment as Trump's proposed policies are considered to be deeply negative for the country. 
The U.S. currency was down 2.2 percent at 18.59 pesos to the dollar , its weakest since Oct. 26.
Risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar also gained on the yen and euro in early trade, with the Aussie climbing 1.1 percent to 80.04 yen (AUDJPY=).

The final NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed Clinton holding a four-point lead over Trump. Clinton leads by a slender 1.8 points according to Real Clear Politics' polling average.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2016 05:21AM ET</span>",Newly floated Egyptian pound moves little as interbank trading begins,"By Ahmed Aboulenein and Asma Alsharif
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's pound was almost steady early on Sunday as banks began trading freely for the first time since authorities ditched the currency's peg in a policy shift designed to crush a black market and clinch an International Monetary Fund loan. 
Interbank trading began at 1030 a.m. (0830 GMT) but activity was extremely slow because banks were uncertain about the prospects for supply and demand of U.S. dollars. 
The pound weakened slightly from 15.50 against the dollar on opening to 15.75 in the first 75 minutes. Banks were bidding for dollars around 15.60 and offering around 16.00. The pound had closed at 15.35 on Saturday.
Despite the slow start, Egyptians are braced for a currency rollercoaster in coming days and weeks, with many expecting further depreciation of the pound as banks struggle to meet an anticipated deluge of pent-up dollar demand from companies that struggled for two years to secure hard currency. 
""People do not know how to trade FX in a free market yet. I'd say it will touch 18 before the end of the day if anyone is offering,"" said one banker. ""Activity will pick up tomorrow, irrespective of what happens today.""
Egypt floated its currency on Thursday, initially devaluing it by about a third from its peg of 8.8 to the dollar and then letting the currency drift weaker. 
Banks were open over the Friday-Saturday weekend but Sunday was the first formal day of trading without direct central bank guidance.
Business people and importers have welcomed the float, which ended strict rationing of dollar supplies at banks and dealt a blow to the dollar black market, which boomed under the peg. 
The pound hit a record low of 18 per dollar on the black market last Sunday, prompting a boycott by importers. This saw the rate bounce back to 13 per dollar within days, giving the central bank a window in which it could abandon the peg with relatively little risk of massive volatility.
Some bankers expressed disappointment that the central bank has not flooded the system with hard currency to help stabilize the pound in the early weeks of trade. They predicted the black market would return if banks are unable to meet the backlog of dollar demand at businesses.
However, bankers said the central bank could still intervene by the back door, providing state-owned Banque Misr and National Bank of Egypt with foreign currency to sell to other banks. On Sunday morning, there was no evidence that this had happened.
Black market traders met late on Saturday to discuss the currency situation. One black market source said the traders, believing the banks would be unable to meet dollar demand, had decided at the meeting to start selling dollars at 18.50 pounds.
""Importers will be desperate so they will have to go to us for FX,"" the source said. 
But businessmen have become deeply frustrated by black market profiteering and rather than go back to that market, some may prefer to pay more expensive rates for dollars from banks in order to help stabilize the new currency system.
""The interbank market started and there is not much activity. There are mispricings in the market but apparently no one is taking advantage of them,"" said one local banker, adding that there should be some volume traded later in the day.

""People have to test it, even if it is at small volumes.""

(Reuters) - Speculators increased positive bets on the U.S. dollar for a sixth straight week, with net longs touching their highest in more than nine months, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
The value of the dollar's net long position advanced to $20.78 billion in the week ended Nov. 1, from $18.81 billion the previous week. This week's net long dollar position was the largest since late January.
Over the last few months, the dollar's positive momentum has been driven by expectations the Federal Reserve will hike rates next month. An October U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday was generally viewed as positive overall despite coming out lower than expected with 161,000 jobs created.
""The October jobs report was generally better than expected despite the headline miss, and does not contain anything to deter the Fed from raising rates in December as we and many investors presently expect,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist at BNY Mellon in Boston.
The chances of a rate hike increased further and currently point to an 80 percent chance that the Fed raises the funds rate by 25 basis points in six weeks. 
For the month of October, the dollar index rose more than 3 percent, although it pulled back a little bit this month, sliding 1.5 percent (DXY).
The upcoming U.S. presidential election has yet to figure in a significant way among speculative investors. The general perception though is that a victory by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be positive for the dollar because it would mean a continuation of the Fed's current monetary policy, said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.
Sterling net short contracts, meanwhile, continued its decline to 82,961 contracts, the lowest since late September. Short contracts on the pound have fallen for five straight weeks. 
Worries have eased that Britain would undergo a ""hard"" exit from the European Union and lose its access to the single market. The pound has rebounded nearly 3 percent  this week to register its best weekly performance against the dollar since October 2009.
The euro net short position, on the other hand, touched its highest level since mid-January at 137,385 contracts, data showed.

The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2016 12:40PM ET</span>",Trumped-up sterling bounce could spark bigger shakeout,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - It took just a few short minutes on Thursday to create the beginnings of a move that may bring down the financial world's most clear-cut trade of 2016.
It has been largely plain sailing for those betting on a weaker British pound since the launch of a sustained period of selling a year ago on the idea that Britain's vote on whether to leave the European Union might be a very close thing.
Those bets reached record levels as polls tightened before the referendum in June, and since the vote to leave they have accelerated on signs that Prime Minister Theresa May favors a ""hard"" exit that would also take Britain out of the single market.
Sterling  (EURGBP=) was one of the worst-performing currencies in the world last month, dumped by investors along with the likes of the Egyptian pound  and the Nigerian naira.  
Custodial banks who serve ""real money"" investors - big global pension and investment funds that tend to set the broad direction in the markets, say they have all piled in to structures that bet on a weaker pound. http://tmsnrt.rs/2fKYToc
Likewise, the stepped nature of the fall since June has played well for many of the hedge funds, banks and other short-term investors who dip in and out of currencies with high-risk, heavily leveraged bets. 
All of that now feels threatened after the London High Court's ruling on Thursday that May must have parliament's approval to trigger the Brexit process in Brussels.
The ruling throws doubt on the government's timetable for launching Brexit talks, hands substantial ammunition to ""Bremainers"" and supporters of softer terms of departure, and even puts the idea of an election this year on the table.
Add expectations of a sharp fall in the dollar if Donald Trump wins the White House on Tuesday, and you have a recipe for heightened nerves in trading rooms in London and New York over the next few days. 
""The only FX consensus position that hasn't been challenged this month is short sterling,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment for Millennium Global in London, a specialist firm that manages currencies for major asset managers. 
""If you got a Trump victory next Tuesday it would be majorly challenged. If we were to wake up to sterling at $1.2650 or higher, watch out, we could go anywhere.""
STOCKS PUTS
Anecdotally, banks report some foreign investors have simply sold selected UK assets over the past three months or, once sterling had fallen substantially, bought in and hedged - for which, read ""sold"" - the currency to lock in the gain. 
But the clearest visible trend has been one of buying blue-chip FTSE100 shares and selling mid-caps on the assumption the bigger UK-based global firms will benefit from a weaker pound making exports more competitive. 
French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) on Friday recommended backing out of that trade. 
""The pound is already pricing in a 'worst-case' Brexit scenario, suggesting that UK equity investors now need to prepare for the winter via FTSE100 puts,"" equity and derivative strategist Ankit Gheedia wrote in a note to clients.
But it is the scale of the consensus on the currency that worries many.
As this pair of charts shows, sterling positioning is now at its most stretched ever in favor of more weakness. In seven previous periods over the last two decades when extreme short sterling positions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have been amassed, the currency has bounced back an average of 12 percent in the subsequent weeks and months. 
The big exception was its 32 percent plunge in 2008-09 during the global financial crisis. http://tmsnrt.rs/2ekQXEX 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said that the High Court ruling could make even its near-term target of $1.20 harder to reach.
""It reduces the odds that Article 50 will be triggered by March and, more fundamentally, may limit how aggressive the government can be in its negotiating position,"" they said. 
""The probability of 'hard Brexit' has shrunk, which could see sterling settle around $1.26 in the near term.""
A Reuters poll of more than 60 forex strategists earlier in the week suggested sterling may drop around 5 percent against the dollar soon after Britain starts formal divorce proceedings from the EU.

The median view one-month forecast in the poll was $1.22, but 12 forecasters said sterling could be trading at $1.24 or higher in a month's time.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2016 08:15AM ET</span>","Trump worries hand dollar worst week in 12, jobs data eyed","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar inched up from a four-week low on Friday ahead of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report later in the day but was on track for its worst week in 12, pressured by worries that Donald Trump could win next week's U.S. presidential election. 
The greenback has fallen 1.2 percent this week against a basket of major currencies (DXY) as Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead over Republican rival Trump in polls has dwindled following the re-emergence of a controversy over her private email server.
The U.S. currency hit a nine-month high last week as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates later this year, but a Trump victory is seen creating political turmoil, while a Clinton victory is seen as a continuation of the status quo. 
""Political uncertainty ... tends to be currency-negative because the markets find it more difficult to work out how things like trade policy and foreign policy are going to play out in the economy,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. 
""What we do know about Trump is that he favors protectionist policies. And what we know about protectionist policies is that they're likely to be inflationary. That brings on a layer of uncertainty to the Federal Reserve."" 
Economists polled by Reuters forecast 175,000 jobs to have been added in October, in data due at 0830 ET. An upbeat jobs report is expected to bolster bets on a December rate hike, which would typically push U.S. yields higher and support the greenback. 
But politics have moved ahead of economics as a factor in foreign exchange markets in recent weeks. Investors are focused on the Nov. 8 election and have paid scant attention to what would normally be key events such as the Fed's policy decision earlier this week. 
""The market is likely to greet a strong payrolls report with a straightforward enough response and bid the dollar higher,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. ""But the rise could fade quickly amid the 'Trump risk' woes."" 
Any rise in the dollar right now will provide an opportunity for participants who have been caught long on the currency and want to square their positions, Ishikawa added.
The dollar was flat at 103.080 yen , having struck a one-month low of 102.55 yen on Thursday. It has fallen 1.6 percent this week against the Japanese currency, with the yen and other perceived safe-havens such as the Swiss franc having benefited from the worries about Trump.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2016 06:52AM ET</span>",Sterling sees best week since March as 'hard Brexit' fears ease,"By Yumna Mohamed
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling traded close to a four-week high on Friday and was heading for its best week since March, having jumped after England's High Court put a spanner in the government's plans to forge ahead with Britain's exit from the European Union. 
The battered pound has clawed back 2.5 percent against the dollar this week , with Thursday's court ruling adding to a run of political and economic developments perceived as positive by investors worrying over the economic fallout of Brexit. 
The pound surged to a four-week high close to $1.25 on Thursday after the court's decision that the government needed parliamentary approval to trigger Article 50, which will formally start the process of exiting the EU. On Friday it remained close to that high at $1.2480. 
Investors are hoping that Britain might now be able to avoid an economically disruptive ""hard Brexit"", reckoning lawmakers - a majority of whom supported staying in the EU in June's referendum - will now be emboldened and will push for Britain to keep access to Europe's single market.
CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said political factors were dominating, with sterling also benefiting this week from a dollar weakened by fears that Donald Trump could win the U.S. presidential election. ""I often think markets are a bit like men - they can only focus on one thing at a time,"" he said. 
""We're seeing a bit of a relief rally now that the worst case scenario of a unilateral 'hard Brexit' has been deferred, and markets can start focusing on other factors (like) the U.S. presidential election.""
The pound started climbing earlier in the week when Mark Carney said he would stay as head of the Bank of England for an extra year to help with a smoother Brexit negotiation process.
It was further boosted on Thursday by the BoE's decision to scrap its plans to cut interest rates and raise its forecasts for 2017 growth and inflation, and also by robust data from Britain's services sector. 
But despite this week's rebound, sterling is still 16 percent lower against the dollar than where it was before June's EU referendum. Against the euro, it is 14 percent weaker (EURGBP=D4) and was trading at 88.90 pence on Friday. 

""We believe that the economy, as well as BoE monetary policy, do not justify the current sterling weakness, but that politics will remain the most volatile component in the equation, preventing sterling from a decent recovery just yet,"" UBS strategist Constantin Bolz said in a note.

USD/CAD hit 1.3361 during early U.S. trade, the session low; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.3389.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.3348, the low of October 27 and resistance at 1.3432, the high of October 28 and a seven-month high.
The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending October 29 increased by 7,000 to 265,000 from the previous week’s total of 258,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to hold steady at 258,000 last week.
The greenback has also been under pressure since the FBI said last Friday that it would review more emails related to Hillary Clinton's private email use while she was secretary of state.
The news sparked fresh uncertainty over Mrs. Clinton’s election prospects ahead of the November 8 vote, amid fears over the implications of a victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump.

This follows a couple rough days for the peso. The currency had tumbled after a prior poll showed Trump in the lead.
""What has unsettled the markets is not that there are two flawed candidates. Rather investors had grown comfortable with the idea that Clinton was going to win, and last week's announcement by the FBI has made them doubt this,"" Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman,  wrote. 
""Investors know that regardless of their personal feelings, Clinton is a known quantity. Trump simply is not. This is not a slight. Agents of change are by definition more hostile to longstanding practices that have become a tradition,"" he added.
Zooming out to look at the bigger picture, it's notable that politics has become a greater player in markets over the last year. While it's not wholly unexpected to see market moves with respect to  political turmoil in  emerging markets given long-run structural issues, it's notable that this year we've seen markets reacting to an increasing number of ""unknown"" political developments in developed markets — for example, with the US presidential election  and Brexit.
""The separation of politics and economics is taken for granted by many, and that makes this current period so frustrating,"" Chandler wrote. ""Investors, perhaps like many voters, just want to get the US election over with already. And yet this is a democratic moment, for all its warts and frailties and flaws. ""

GBP/USD hit highs of 1.2494, the strongest level since October 7 and was last at 1.2484.
The monetary policy committee of the BoE voted to leave interest rates on hold, at the current record low of 0.25%.
The MPC also left the quantitative easing program unchanged, at £425 billion.
Both decisions were unanimous, with the committee voting nine to zero.
The bank raised its growth forecasts for this year and next, but cut its 2018 growth forecast.
The BoE now expects economic growth of 2.2% in 2016, up from 2% previously and growth of 1.4% in 2017, almost double the 0.8% it initially expected.
But it expects growth to slow to 1.5% in 2018, down from 1.8%.
The bank also expects a sharp increase in inflation largely due to the slump in sterling, forecasting an annual rate of inflation of 2.7% in a year’s time, up from 2.0% in August.
It believes inflation will peak at 2.83% in the second quarter of 2018.
In its statement, the bank said the economy has performed more strongly than it expected in August, but added that there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.
“Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target,” the statement said.
BoE Governor Mark Carney was to hold a press conference later Thursday.
The pound strengthened earlier Thursday after the UK high court ruled that the government does not have the authority to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to start the UK’s exit from the EU without a parliamentary vote.
Sterling received an additional boost after data showing that activity in Britain’s service sector accelerated to the fastest since January last month, but the data also pointed to a marked build up in inflationary pressures.
Financial data company Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.5 in October from September’s 52.6.
Economists had expected the index to tick down to 52.4.
Similar surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors earlier this week also pointed to mounting inflation pressures, indicating that increases faced by companies will soon feed through into prices paid by consumers.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2016 06:00AM ET</span>","Dollar plagued by U.S. election jitters, with jobs data ahead","By Yumna Mohamed
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar lost more ground in early European trading on Thursday, sinking another half a percent against the yen and other currencies after more reports on FBI probes into presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
With investors increasingly worried by the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency that they fear would carry global risks to trade and growth, the yen has gained more than 3 percent against the dollar in just over a week. 
Investors were unsettled by media reports that some agents at the FBI had wanted to press ahead with an investigation of the Clinton Foundation, the latest twist in a long-running inquiry into candidate Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.
That overshadowed any impact from the U.S. Federal Reserve's November meeting and statement late on Wednesday and sent the dollar to a 1-month low against the yen, and to more than $1.11 per euro for the first time since Oct. 10. 
""It’s difficult for any policy maker to make a massive commitment given the big question mark between now and next week, but it was enough to keep the Fed hawkish on a December hike,"" said ING strategist Viraj Patel of the Fed's decision to hold rates. 
""It was probably the most rational outcome and you can see that markets understood this because prices weren’t too affected by the meeting yesterday."" 
President Barack Obama spoke out for the first time on Wednesday in defense of Clinton, warning the FBI that there was ""no room for innuendo"" in the investigative process. 
The dollar was last down 0.4 percent to 102.86 yen <JPY=> at 0426 ET  with markets in Japan closed for a public holiday.
An average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics website showed Clinton just 1.7 percent ahead of Trump nationally on Wednesday, with 47 percent support to his 45.3 percent. 
But a Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on the same day showed Clinton ahead by 6 percentage points among likely voters.
Traders were pricing in a 78 percent likelihood that the Fed will raise interest rates in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. But a Trump win is widely thought to have the potential to delay that move. 
""While a December rate rise still seems the most likely outcome and the probability of a move in December has gone up to 78% overnight, we can’t rule out the prospect of a delay if the U.S. economy undergoes a Trumpectomy in just under a weeks’ time,"" CMC Markets strategist Michael Hewson said in a note.
A robust U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday is also seen as a crucial ingredient to any Fed move. Employers are expected to have added 175,000 jobs in October, according to the median estimate of 106 economists polled by Reuters. [ECONUS]

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.10% at 97.30, off lows of 97.08.
The Fed kept interest rates steady at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday, but indicated that it is on track to raise rates in December.
The announcement was largely in line with market expectations. Few investors had expected a rate hike ahead of the November 8 election.
Polls this week have pointed to an increasingly uncertain outcome for the election.
Many investors have been betting on a victory for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but last week’s announcement that the FBI is to review more emails related to her private email use while she was secretary of state cast fresh uncertainty onto the race.
Investors are currently pricing in a 58.6% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting; according to federal funds futures tracked Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
But analysts have warned that the U.S. central bank could hold off on hiking rates if the election outcome sparks market volatility.
Investors were looking ahead to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for October, for fresh indications that the economy is on a strong enough footing to handle an interest rate hike this year.
The yen, which investors often buy during times of market uncertainty, was higher with USD/JPY down 0.44% at 102.85.
The safe haven Swiss franc was near one-month highs, with USD/CHF sliding to 0.9716.
The Mexican peso weakened against the dollar, with USD/MXN up 0.5% to 19.47.
The Mexican currency has been sensitive to developments in the election amid fears that a victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump could damage the country’s economy.
The euro was steady near three-week highs, with EUR/USD at 1.1105.
Sterling moved higher, with GBP/USD rising 0.29% to 1.2341 ahead of the Bank of England’s rate decision and quarterly inflation forecasts, due for release later Thursday.

560,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 02, 2016 06:09AM ET</span>",Forex - Sterling gains against broadly weaker dollar,"Investing.com - The pound pushed higher against the broadly weaker dollar on Wednesday as concerns over the prospect of a win for Donald Trump in next week’s U.S. presidential election hit the greenback.
GBP/USD climbed 0.22% to 1.2270, up from Tuesday’s close of 1.2243.
Polls on Tuesday indicated an increasingly uncertain outcome for the U.S. presidential election, spurring a flight to safety in global financial markets.
Trump’s odds for winning the U.S. elections increased after the FBI reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.24% to 97.52, the lowest level since October 13.
Sterling’s gains were held in check after ratings agency Moody’s warned that it could downgrade Britain’s credit rating if Brexit causes UK companies to lose access to the EU single market.
Moody’s currently rates the UK as Aa1 after a downgrade on June 24, in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum.
But sterling received a boost after data showing that British construction activity increased at the fastest rate since March last month.
Financial data company Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.6 in October from September’s 52.3.
Economists had expected the index to tick down to 51.8.
New order volumes picked up, but the rate of growth eased since September and remained weaker than seen prior to this summer.
Soaring prices for building materials also clouded the outlook, Markit said.
The report came a day after a similar survey of the manufacturing sector showed that the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote lead to one of the fastest rises in average costs for raw materials in the 25-year survey history, which is likely to feed through to shop prices.
Meanwhile, sterling was little changed against the euro, with EUR/GBP at 0.9034."

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar slumped and the Swiss franc and Japanese yen surged on Wednesday as investors worried by the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency sought out safe havens for their money. 
The yen, driven lower in the past month as investors abandoned long-term bets on it strengthening past 100 yen per dollar, gained more than half a percent to hit its highest since Oct. 21 against the dollar.
The franc hit its highest in a month against the greenback and a four-month peak against the euro. It has gained almost 3 percent in the past week as improving polls for Trump prompted investors to trim bets on a rise in U.S. interest rates in December. 
Polls on Tuesday put Trump ahead by 1-2 percentage points, although Clinton held a five-percentage-point in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday.
""The resurgence of Donald Trump in the polls so close to election day has seriously rattled investors,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst with Oanda in London. 
""It’s been clear for some time now that markets would much prefer the stability that a Clinton victory would bring for the U.S. economy and the reaction over the last 24 hours or so since the polls started to change so dramatically just confirms this.""
The euro, whose extremely low interest rates have increasingly seen it gain at times when investors are feeling less sure about global economic growth, gained a third of a percent to hit a three-week high of $1.1099.
While some argue that a Trump presidency might lead to substantial repatriation of funds to the United States - and hence into dollars - the running assumption of markets in the past month has been that the dollar would fall if he won.
That largely seems the product of the potential for investors to take risk off the table, as they were on Wednesday, as well as the prospect that any blip on markets globally might cause the U.S. Federal Reserve to put a rise in interest rates on hold. 
As Clinton moved ahead after Trump was linked to sex scandals last month, investors bought the dollar and priced in a strong chance of a Fed move in December. 
The Fed ends its two-day November meeting on Wednesday and will issue a statement that is widely expected to open the door, on economic grounds, to a rise next month. 
""Neither a positive signal sent out by the labor market report (on Friday) nor the willingness of the Fed to hike rates is likely to constitute a reason for the market to trade the dollar stronger today,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Esther Reichelt.

""The market knows full well that everything could look very different in a week’s time.""

562,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2016 04:50AM ET</span>","Worried about yuan drop, Chinese foreign buying binge gives authorities a headache","By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Wealth managers like Huang Qing are tormenting the authorities in Beijing.
The Chinese government has introduced a slew of measures to curb capital outflows in recent years as it seeks to prevent a sudden plunge in the yuan. They include cracking down on underground banks and sales of foreign insurance products that are more like investments, increasing scrutiny of overseas deals, and keeping tight restrictions on foreign currency purchases by individuals. 
Yet Huang says he still finds legitimate ways to move his clients money overseas, creating a headache for China’s central bank as it seeks to keep the currency, which is also known as the renminbi, relatively stable.
“Over the past year, we have helped many clients allocate their wealth into U.S. dollar assets, and the biggest obstacle we encountered was how to move renminbi overseas in a proper, legal manner,"" Huang, Shanghai manager at CreditEase, which specializes in managing money for wealthy Chinese investors, recently told a forum in Shanghai.
CreditEase, which has been raising money from Chinese investors to buy property assets in the United States and Europe, sets an investment minimum threshold of $150,000, but Beijing caps individual foreign currency purchases at $50,000 a year.
""So, we had to use the $50,000 quotas from all their family members, both old and young, to meet our investment threshold. This is what we have been beating our brains out to do for our clients over the past year,” said Huang. 
It is paying off.
Since last April, CreditEase has successfully raised more than $300 million from Chinese investors for two dollar-denominated real estate funds, and is now launching a third.
It is this kind of activity that has increased demand for the dollar and pressured the Chinese currency. The yuan <CNY=CFXS> has declined to its weakest levels against the dollar in six years, touching 6.7869 last Friday.
During the first nine months of this year, individuals and companies made net foreign exchange purchases of $243.4 billion, according to China’s forex regulator, though the pace is down from the $465.9 billion recorded in 2015 when a plunge in Chinese stock markets unnerved investors.
Meanwhile, China’s foreign currency reserves  have fallen to $3.17 trillion at the end of September, from a $3.99 trillion peak in June 2014, indicating that the Chinese government sold U.S. dollars to prop up the yuan’s value. 
BIG CORPORATE FLOWS
It’s not only individuals who have engaged in moving their assets overseas.
China's outward direct investment (ODI) surged 71 percent during the first six months of 2016 to $121.4 billion, as Chinese companies bought assets overseas, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
China’s outbound acquisition boom has been fueled by Beijing’s strategy to develop overseas markets by helping to finance infrastructure, easy access to liquidity in China, and the lower valuations of many overseas assets when compared with those in China, said Samson Lambert Lo, head of mergers and acquisitions for UBS in Asia.
Financial institutions have been using the yuan's recent depreciation to push more people to increase their foreign exposure.
""Attack is the best form of defense,"" Chinese wealth manager  Jupai Holdings Ltd  (N:JP), which had $3.90 billion under management at the end of June, said in a recent advertisement on the messaging app WeChat. ""Allocating U.S. dollar assets can effectively hedge against yuan depreciation risks,"" the ad said.
The Chinese government has been seeking to dispel concerns there will be further yuan depreciation.
Wang Chunying, a spokeswoman for SAFE, told a news conference on Oct 21 that recent strong dollar purchases were driven by seasonal factors such as the summer tourism season. 
The official media has also weighed in. 
""Yuan's recent depreciation against the dollar was mainly the result of dollar strength ... but it doesn't mean yuan is entering a one-way deprecation path,"" the overseas edition of the People's Daily wrote on Oct 19.
The Communist Party's mouthpiece added that the yuan will remain “basically stable” in the mid- to long-term.
These soothing words have been accompanies by a series of crackdowns on institutions that help Chinese move money into foreign assets. 
China's biggest bank card provider UnionPay said last Saturday it will tighten rules for how mainland customers can use its debit and credit cards to purchase Hong Kong insurance products. In a related move, the country’s insurance regulator recently visited foreign life insurance firms in Beijing as part of an investigation into the illegal sale of insurance products in Hong Kong to mainland Chinese, the official Shanghai Securities News reported on Monday.
But many in the market don't buy such actions and commentary and expect the market to test Beijing’s resolve. For example, Shanghai businessman Shi Luqun, says he has acquired a property in the United States because he fears the yuan could weaken by at least 15 percent against the dollar over the next two years. He cites structural problems in the Chinese economy – such as over-dependence on real estate and exports – as well as the likelihood of devaluations by rival trading nations. 
A sales executive at Yuwo Capital, which helps Chinese invest in or migrate to the United States, said it has seen a rise in client enquiries recently, with some bringing forward their U.S. investment plans due to depreciation fears. He asked not to be identified. 
Huang at CreditEase recalled that in 2006, when he was working at a foreign bank, a client spent an entire year converting $1 million into yuan assets because of capital restrictions at a time when the yuan was appreciating. “Today, it's the other way around,” he said. 

Still, some see a chance to capitalize on the yuan’s weakness by investing at home. For example, asset manager First Seafront Fund Management Co has set up a fund that will bet on Chinese exporters who will directly benefit from yuan depreciation.

570,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 01, 2016 11:09AM ET</span>",The Mexican peso dives after a new poll shows Trump leading Clinton by one point,"The currency is down by 1.2%, at 19.0992 per dollar, as of 10:45 a.m. ET after hovering in the green earlier in the day.
Forty-six percent of likely voters support Trump, while 45% support Clinton, according to the latest poll. For what it's worth, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson is at 3%, which the report notes is a new low, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein is at 2%.

The peso has become  something of a gauge of Trump's prospects over the last couple of months of the campaign. Earlier, for example, currency watchers argued that the  peso's strengthening after the first debate suggested that investors thought Clinton had won.
This sort of makes sense, given that Trump's anti-trade platform could have negative repercussions for the Mexican economy.
A Capital Economics team recently put together a chart showing the probability of a Trump presidency versus the Mexican peso/US dollar moves, which you can see below. (Note that the chart ends in October, so the most recent figures aren't factored in. Also, mind the double y-axis.)
However, it's also worth noting that the peso's moves are not entirely linked to Trump's performance in the polls.
Neil Shearing, Capital Economics' chief emerging-markets economist, said several weeks ago that ""since January 2015, the peso has weakened by more than any other major EM currency. So while Trump may have weighed on the peso at the margin, this isn't the whole story.""
Rather, he suggested, the floundering currency can be more explained by a structural deterioration in the country's economic position amid long-run issues at Pemex, the state-owned oil company, and chronically weak productivity growth."
571,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2016 11:00AM ET</span>",Mexico peso seen plunging 10 percent if Trump wins U.S. election - Reuters poll,"By Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Mexico's peso could plunge more than 10 percent to a record low against the dollar in a matter of weeks if Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, according to a Reuters poll of currency strategists published on Tuesday.
The likelihood of a Hillary Clinton victory is mostly priced in as opinion polls continue to show an edge to the Democratic candidate, the survey suggested. 
But a small, short-lived relief rally still looks likely under that scenario following months of heated debates over Trump's proposals to build a border wall and rewrite trade agreements with Mexico.
Forecasts for most other currencies in the region were revised slightly higher compared with early October, with an amnesty program for the repatriation of illegal funds abroad helping the Brazilian real sustain some of the stronger gains this year among emerging currencies.
The median forecast of 24 strategists for the Mexican peso in a year projected the currency at 18.53 per dollar, up 2 percent from Monday's close. 
However the currency will be prone to sharp swings as the U.S. election draws nearer.
Nine strategists who replied to an extra question on the peso outlook in the weeks following the election projected the currency to strengthen to 18.10 per dollar if Clinton wins or weaken to 21.50 per dollar if Trump wins, according to median forecasts.
The range of estimates was particularly broad for the ""Trump wins"" scenario, with one strategist forecasting the currency reaching 25 per dollar, more than 20 percent weaker than its current record low of 19.92 per dollar hit in September.
In the ""Clinton wins"" scenario, potential gains for the Mexican peso were seen as likely to fade quickly, as prospects of U.S. interest rate hikes and a threat of a debt rating downgrade should continue to weigh on the currency.
""We still expect the peso to come under some level of pressure into year end as attentions shift to the prospect of a Fed rate hike in December. A Clinton win would keep the door open for this,"" said Natalie Rivett, an economist with Informa Global Markets, in the poll. 
The peso has been the second-worst performing major currency in 2016 after the British pound. It was already underperforming other emerging market currencies before Trump became the Republican presidential nominee. 
""It's important to remember that the heavy depreciation of the Mexican peso started in the second half of 2014 due to fears of capital outflows as the U.S. highly accommodative monetary policy was nearing an end. This fear will persist,"" Banco Base economist Jesus Lopez said. 
Strategists were evenly split on whether the Mexican peso will outperform other emerging market currencies in 2017.
The survey findings are similar to a Reuters poll of fund managers last week, which showed debtholders expect the Mexican peso to firm to 18 per dollar if Clinton wins or weaken to 21 per dollar if Trump wins.

The Brazilian real is expected to weaken to 3.37 per dollar in a year, according to the median forecast in the poll. The Colombian peso is seen at 3008 per dollar, the Chilean peso at 682 per dollar, the Peruvian sol at 3.48 per dollar, and the Argentine peso at 17.50, the poll showed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling was quickly back under pressure on Tuesday after a brief boost from news Mark Carney would stay on until 2019 at the helm of the Bank of England, easing concerns for now about perceived attacks on its independence.
Criticism from some ruling Conservatives and right-leaning newspapers that Carney had taken too political a stance in the run-up to Britain's EU membership referendum had prompted speculation over the past week that the governor might leave before 2018, the scheduled end of his initial term. 
That uncertainty fueled jitters over Britain's economic prospects as it heads into negotiations on post-Brexit relations with the EU, and on Monday Prime Minister Theresa May moved to back Carney, having previously been critical of his policy of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. 
Carney's announcement late on Monday that he would stay until the end of June 2019 - three months after Britain is scheduled to leave the EU - pushed sterling up, and it reached as high as $1.2281 on Tuesday before easing back to $1.2234, flat on the day.
It fell back half a percent to 90.10 pence against a broadly stronger euro. 
""The fact that he’s staying for a bit longer than some people suggested has just provided a bit more certainty about the outlook, that the role hasn’t become as politicized as some feared,"" said HSBC currency strategist Dominic Bunning. 
""So I can see why sterling bounced on the back of that from the very low levels we were at. But is it going to be enough to drive a much stronger currency? Not really.""
SHORT EXTENSION
Under the terms of his appointment in 2013, Carney agreed to stay at the Bank for five years with the option to stay for a further three. 
But around a year ago, he hinted at the possibility of taking up the extension and most economists in a Reuters poll last week said they expected Carney to agree to stay on beyond 2018.
That raised the question of whether the brief one-year extension will still leave Britain looking more exposed than it otherwise would be to financial market nerves in the second half of a two-year period of talks on leaving the bloc. 
The senior London-based analysts and investors Reuters talked to on Tuesday said that might come back to haunt the pound - already down almost a fifth in value since June - but would be of secondary importance to the Brexit process.
""If by that time (June 2019) you hadn't got a ready replacement with some credibility and things are going awry on the negotiation front with the EU, then it becomes a problem for sterling,"" he said. 
""But if things are going awry in the EU negotiations, that will be becoming an issue for sterling anyway, whether Carney is there or not."" 
Some investors agreed with criticism from Conservative party politicians such as the pro-Brexit Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said Carney had compromised the Bank's independence - which it was granted in 1997 - by warning of the economic risks of Brexit.
But most analysts argued that the fact that Carney was staying for a sixth year proved the opposite.
""It would have left a bad taste in the market's mouth if there had been the feeling he had been forced out,"" said Morgan Stanley's head of G10 currency strategy, Hans Redecker. 

""We need continuity through the period of the negotiations.""

575,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2016 08:09AM ET</span>","Aussie bounces on upbeat RBA, China survey","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The Australian and New Zealand dollars gained strongly on a handful of upbeat Asian economic surveys on Tuesday as their U.S. counterpart struggled in the face of concern around next week's presidential election. 
A relatively upbeat statement from the Australian central bank quashed any expectations of a near-term cut in interest rates and reduced the prospects of one next year, fuelling an almost 1 percent rise for the Aussie. 
The kiwi gained almost half a percent , helped by sentiment surveys that showed Indian and Chinese factories growing at the fastest pace in two years. 
""There were a few economists expecting a cut (from the RBA) ... so the fact they didn’t provided a bit of relief for the currency,"" said Dominic Bunning, a currency strategist with HSBC in London. 
""But also there was a general question mark over whether they might be a bit more dovish in the statement, because inflation obviously has been low... The fact that they are flexible on the inflation target, just provided a bit of a relief rally.""
The gains for the kiwi pointed to a broader trend driven by a rise in global bond yields that stems both from hopes of some improvement in the world's economic prospects and worries over political risk. 
Neil Mellor, a strategist with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London, identified the rise in the Aussie as part of a broader trend to jump on the currency of any central bank that hints at a move away from the ultra-loose policy of the past decade. 
""The Reserve Bank (of Australia) is looking at fairly weak consumer prices but asset and house prices that are going through the roof,"" Mellor said. 
""The feeling is that now the economy is doing ok, they may be able to ease back. And anytime a central bank talks about taking their foot off the throttle they get a rise in the currency.""
Elsewhere, a Bank of Japan meeting that again pushed back the horizon on getting inflation back to target was not enough to halt the yen's recent falls. It dipped 0.3 percent to 105.12 yen per dollar <JPY=>, less than half a yen off three-month lows hit last week, before steadying around 104.85 yen. 
The dollar continued to edge lower going into the final days of a fractious U.S. presidential campaign. 
The potential of an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to turn the campaign in favor of businessman Donald Trump has been a negative so far this week for the U.S. currency, although it has also added to support for Treasury yields, in turn a dollar positive.
The euro gained around 0.4 percent to trade above $1.10 for the first time in around two weeks <EUR=>, driving a similar loss for the dollar index to 98.041 (DXY). 

Another perceived safe haven from any broader nerves around a Trump presidency, the Swiss franc, gained 0.6 percent to 0.9813 francs per dollar, a three-week high.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - China's yuan will weaken to its lowest level since the financial crisis in the next 12 months as rising chances of a December U.S. interest rate hike boost the dollar, a Reuters poll showed. 
The survey, which also expects India's rupee to fall slightly from here, offers a dim outlook for emerging Asia's top currencies, and by extension, other regional foreign exchange rates that are closely tied to the yuan's fortunes.
The yuan, also known as the renminbi, is already down over 4 percent against the dollar so far this year, continuing a trend that started last August when Beijing allowed the yuan to slide sharply, which it repeated in January.
It fell over 1.5 percent in October alone as the greenback rose broadly against major global currencies in anticipation of a near-term rate move from the Federal Reserve following solid U.S. economic and job growth.
Still, the survey of over 60 foreign exchange strategists conducted in the past few days showed the yuan falling to 6.80 per dollar by end-January 2017, and to 6.90 by end-October - a drop of almost 2 percent from Tuesday's 6.78.
That 12-month consensus is the weakest in six years of Reuters polls and, if realized, would mark the lowest level for China's closely managed currency since mid-2008, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers brought on a global recession.
""We expect pressure on the yuan to continue through 2017 amid persistent economic uncertainty...,"" said Jennifer Lee, economist at BMO Capital Markets.
While the latest run of data out of China suggests that economic growth has steadied for now, the yuan still faces risks from financial outflows and a rising U.S. dollar, Lee added.
BMO's forecast for the yuan's 12-month rate was 6.81 to the dollar, somewhat more optimistic than the median. Around a third of respondents had a call of 7.00 or lower.
A Reuters poll last week showed bearish bets on the yuan hit a near 10-month high in the previous two weeks. 
China's economy expanded 6.7 percent between July-September, the third consecutive quarter of the same growth rate, driven by stronger government spending, adding to its massive debt pile. Growth has been buoyed by a construction boom, fueled by infrastructure projects and a housing boom, though exports remain weak despite the yuan's slide.
Preliminary indications are that trend of unwavering growth could extend to the fourth quarter, with an official survey on Tuesday showing China's manufacturing sector expanded at a faster pace in October.
While the upbeat data may reinforce views that the PBoC won't act in a hurry, high levels of overcapacity in Chinese industries and worries that a housing rally has peaked will keep alive some hope of easing.
Much will depend on when the Fed next raises rates and the path of policy tightening it projects for 2017.
The vast majority of economists polled by Reuters forecast a hike in the benchmark lending rate at the Fed's Dec. 13-14 meeting, with about a 70 percent probability, now in line with financial market pricing. 
The Fed's solo path of tightening compared with its peers will probably make the dollar drift higher through the coming year on its own, the wider global poll of FX strategists also showed. 
The poll also showed the rupee will weaken to 67.00 a dollar by end-Jan 2017 and 67.50 by end October, a fall of 1 percent from Tuesday's 66.72.
Markets expect the Reserve Bank of India will follow through with another 25 basis point rate cut by end-March, after its surprise move last month.

(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar is likely to drift higher into next year as the Federal Reserve forges a lone but gradual path toward higher interest rates, according to foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters.
The run-up to and immediate aftermath of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8 could still pose some near-term risk to the currency, but a narrow range of forecasts among the bulk of the more than 60 participants surveyed on Oct. 26-31 suggests much of that has already been factored in.
The dollar unexpectedly rallied more than 3 percent in October, hitting a near nine-month high against a basket of currencies on the back of solid U.S. economic data.
That has bolted down expectations among traders and analysts for the Fed to finally deliver an interest rate rise in December, a year since the last one and following much hesitation and many delays throughout 2016.
As those expectations have firmed, strategists do not expect the currency to rally much further in the year ahead, although with no other major central bank about to raise rates, the path of least resistance should be upwards.
""While we can't foresee the next global risk flare-up ... we judge that prospective Fed tightening will become a more consistent driver of U.S. dollar strength,"" wrote Benjamin Reitzes, senior economist at BMO.
""But with tightening prospects having dimmed meaningfully from where they stood amid lift-off, we doubt the greenback will revisit January's peak anytime soon.""
The latest poll predicted the euro would trade at around $1.09 in one, three, six and 12 months, about where it was on Monday and also where the common currency started in 2016.
RISKS TO UPSIDE
While currencies are rarely that stable, it gives an idea of how comfortable many strategists are with the current rate. The range of forecasts on the 12-month horizon was 0.95 to 1.20.
Still, more than one-third of the strategists who answered an extra question said the risks to their dollar forecasts were more to the upside over the coming year.
Currency speculators also increased their bets in favor of the dollar for a fifth straight week and to the highest since late January, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
""USD gains are likely to continue ... With the market pricing not even a full hike over the course of 2017, risk-reward is skewed toward the central bank sounding more hawkish, which would push USD higher,"" wrote Hans Redeker, global head of FX Strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
While the Bank of Japan has expanded on its already massive stimulus this year, the yen has surged more than 12 percent against the dollar, defying a drumbeat of predictions for a weaker yen that has gone on for years now. 
""The Japanese yen continues to defy logic. It rallies not only when there is a flight from risk, but also when the BoJ eases,"" noted BMO's Reitzes.
The yen is forecast to weaken about 1.3 percent to 106.3 against the dollar in a year from around 105.0 on Monday. BMO also expects it to weaken.
The BoJ began its two-day policy review on Monday and was widely expected to stand pat.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2016 03:20AM ET</span>",Sterling to fall to $1.15 after EU divorce proceedings begin: Reuters poll,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling is likely to drop around 5 percent against the dollar soon after Britain starts its formal divorce proceedings from the European Union next year, but it is not expected to weaken to parity with the euro, a Reuters poll found.
Since Britons voted on June 23 to leave the EU, the pound has dropped almost 20 percent against the dollar, a decline that is not yet over, according to the poll of over 60 foreign exchange strategists taken in the past few days.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said she intends to trigger Article 50, which starts the two-year countdown to leaving the EU, before the end of March, and the median forecast suggested after she does the pound would fall to $1.15.
Many people think May is leaning towards a ""hard Brexit"" - imposing controls on immigration but giving up access to the EU single market - which would hinder trade and further hurt sterling.
But details about what form the talks will take have been scant, and data since the referendum have generally been better than expected, so the outlook is far from clear.
""Next year, we see the economy holding up somewhat better than some commentators still fear, whilst hopefully we should get a little more clarity on Brexit arrangements,"" said Chris Hare at Investec, who sees little downwards movement.
Still, forecasts were generally lowered in the latest monthly poll from an October survey after the pound had a torrid few weeks, falling to a 31-year low, which while a boon for exporters means inflation is likely to rise rapidly.
With inflation expected to rise above the Bank of England's target next year, the central bank is not expected to ease policy on Thursday.
Bank Rate is already at a record low of 0.25 percent. That poll published last week predicted another 15 basis points would be taken off early next year.
In contrast, the United States Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates next month, around a year after it last tightened policy.
That would lend additional support to the dollar. The pound is currently trading around $1.216, and medians from the wider poll put the pound at $1.21 in six months and at $1.23 a year from now. In last month's poll the six- and 12-month forecasts were for $1.27.
A few forecasters said the pound may reach or fall below parity with the dollar, the first time anyone has made that forecast in over 20 years of Reuters polls on the currency.
Meanwhile, a stable but lackluster economic outlook is expected to push the European Central Bank to tweak its asset purchase program and announce an extension by year-end.
The pound has also struggled against the euro but only around a sixth of the analysts who answered an extra question said the pound would reach parity with the common currency.
""We don't think EUR/GBP will fall below parity as the euro is under depreciation pressure as much as sterling,"" said Colin Asher at Mizuho Securities.
One euro is currently worth about 89.9 pence and in six months it will be 89.7p. In a year a euro will get you 88.7p.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Monday on reduced worries over the FBI's investigation of more emails linked to Hillary Clinton's use of a private server, while persistently low Japanese government bond yields also boosted the greenback. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.27 percent at 98.611 after hitting an eight-day low of 98.242 on Friday on news of the FBI's probe. The index was on course for a monthly gain of 3.4 percent, its best since January 2015.
“The market is maybe taking a calmer approach to the FBI probe at this point than it was on Friday afternoon,” said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of FX strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York. 
News of the probe hurt the dollar since Clinton is viewed as the candidate of the status quo, and a win for the Democratic candidate in next week's U.S. presidential election is generally seen by analysts as likely to be positive for the dollar.
A Clinton win is also viewed as clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December. There is greater uncertainty over what a victory for Republican candidate Donald Trump might mean for U.S. foreign policy, international trade deals and the domestic economy.
""This is just corrective price action, a little bit of a giveback,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago, in reference to gains in major dollar rivals such as the euro, yen and sterling on Friday. 
The dollar's rebound was modest, with the currency last up just 0.28 percent against the yen <JPY=> at 104.98 yen, still down from a three-month high of 105.530 yen touched Friday. 
The Mexican peso, which hit a three-week low against the dollar of 19.1002 pesos <MXN=> on Friday, was last up 0.23 percent at 18.9160 pesos per dollar. The currency fell on news of the FBI probe since Trump's stances on immigration and trade relations are seen as key risks for the Mexican currency. 
The euro <EUR=> was last down 0.35 percent against the dollar at 1.0945 after hitting an 11-day high of $1.0992 in early trading. Against the Swiss franc , the dollar was up just 0.14 percent at 0.9894 franc. 
Higher yields on government bonds in the United States and Europe also supported the greenback against the yen, Jalinoos said. 

Yields on benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds (JP10YT=RR) were last at negative 0.049 percent, compared with 1.8362 percent for 10-year U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR).

603,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2016 03:32AM ET</span>",Dollar rises to three-month high vs. yen before pivotal U.S. GDP data,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar advanced to a three-month high against the yen on Friday, on track for monthly gains against most major currencies as investors waited for U.S. third-quarter growth data later in the day.
A solid number would give the Federal Reserve an opportunity to upgrade the economic assessment in the November statement and boost prospects for a December rate hike. It could also help reassure stock markets, which would be supportive of the dollar against the safe-haven yen, traders said.
A disappointing result, however, could trigger a fall in the dollar, a scenario that played out in late July when U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product data came in weak.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll is for the U.S. advance third-quarter GDP data to show growth of 2.5 percent, up from 1.4 percent in the previous quarter. 
""We expect an annualized 2.9 percent quarter-on-quarter growth,"" said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), adding that positive trade data issued on Wednesday had raised the chances of a better-than-expected outcome.
""That would come as a surprise to the market and may cause the dollar to appreciate.""
The dollar rose 0.1 percent in early London trade to 105.42 yen , its highest level since July, its gains underpinned by higher U.S. Treasury yields and a rise in U.S. three-month LIBOR -- a key rate for inter-bank lending -- which hit its highest since 2009 . That rise was in part due to growing expectations of a rate hike in December.
U.S. interest rate futures are implying a more than 75 percent chance of the Fed raising interest rates by December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. 
A rise in U.S. bond yields has helped bolster the dollar in recent weeks, the greenback having risen 3.7 percent against the yen so far this month, its biggest monthly gain since May.
The euro  edged higher to $1.0916, but was down nearly 3 percent for the month. The focus in Europe will be on German and French inflation data, which will be scrutinized for clues to euro zone inflation data due on Monday.

""Any slippage (in inflation) may raise questions over an already feeble euro zone inflation outlook,"" said Viraj Patel, currency strategist at ING. ""Expect euro/dollar to come under pressure from a robust U.S. GDP print, with a weekly close below $1.0850 confirmation of the short-term bearish bias.""

604,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2016 01:20AM ET</span>",Fund managers see Clinton win strengthening Mexico peso to 18/dollar: Reuters poll,"By Michael O'Boyle and Dion Rabouin
(Reuters) - Mexico's peso could gain nearly 5 percent if Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidency, according to a Reuters survey of fund managers, even after a significant rally in the currency as polls showed her rival Donald Trump falling behind.
As Trump, a Republican, began gaining in polls in August, the peso tumbled, sinking to a record low near 20 per dollar in mid-September on fears Trump could win and enact economic policy designed to hurt the flow of Mexican trade and remittances.
The peso rallied about 7 percent from its record low as Clinton, a Democrat, advanced in opinion polls, before pulling back from 18.50 since the final presidential debate. Some analysts think it may not appreciate much more.
But 12 of 14 fund managers who hold Mexican debt said they thought a Clinton victory had not been totally priced in.
The median of the poll projected the peso could firm to 18 per dollar the week after the Nov. 8 election if Clinton wins. The peso closed Thursday at 18.84 per dollar.
Should Trump win, the median forecast was for the peso to tumble more than 10 percent to 21 per dollar.
Part of the peso's weakness has been driven by funds betting against it in the forwards market to offset losses on the 1.65 trillion in peso debt ($88 billion) held by foreign investors.
Taking off those bearish bets could boost the currency.
""Will the Trump unwind break that voodoo on the peso, or is there another shackle? It's not clear,"" said Andrew Stanners, a fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.
Any peso rally may be limited by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December, as well as concerns about sluggish growth in Mexico and rising government debt, fund managers said.
The peso has been the second-worst performing major currency in 2016 after the British pound. It was already underperforming other emerging market currencies before Trump's rise in polls.
The fund managers polled were divided about its prospects. Eight of them said they thought the peso would not outperform emerging market currencies in 2017. Six forecast the Mexican currency would break out of its funk and outperform.
If Clinton remains clearly ahead in opinion polls, the market may factor in her victory before the vote, said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos, who expected the peso to hit resistance at 18.50 per dollar.
Even if the peso does reach 18, it would still be down more than 4 percent from its 2015 close at 17.23 per dollar.
Nomura analyst Benito Berber thinks the peso could hit 17.50 by year end if Clinton wins and the Mexican government makes a success of its deep water oil field auctions in December.
Market players are also waiting on a business plan from ailing state oil company Pemex, due next Thursday. Unless promising joint ventures or asset sales emerge from it, concerns about Pemex's financial health risk weighing on the peso.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit its highest in more than seven and a half years against the Swedish crown after dovish comments from Sweden's central bank, and hit a three-month high against the yen on expectations of a December Federal Reserve rate hike.
Sweden's Riksbank said the chances of another interest rate cut had increased and it was ready to expand its quantitative easing program further. The Riksbank has already slashed rates to negative 0.5 percent, and is on track to buy 40 percent of the stock of outstanding government bonds by year end.
The dollar was last up 1.81 percent against the Swedish crown at 9.0689 crowns  after gaining 2 percent earlier and touching 9.0890 crowns, its highest level since early March 2009. 
""You sort of expect the central bank to say something like, 'policy is easy, just the way we like it,'"" said Steven Englander, managing director and global head of G10 FX strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""To take a step further and endorse further weakness ... conveys to the market that you're supremely dovish."" 
The dollar hit a three-month high against the yen of 105.34 yen , and was last up 0.75 percent against the Japanese currency at 105.24 yen. Analysts said a rise in U.S. Treasury yields on expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in December were behind the move. U.S. yields climbed to roughly five-month peaks during the session.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sweden's crown hit a 6-1/2-year low against the euro on Thursday, after the central bank said the chances of another interest rate cut had increased and it was ready to expand its quantitative easing program further. 
The Riksbank has already slashed rates to -0.5 percent, and is on track to buy 40 percent of the stock of outstanding government bonds by year end. But inflation remains subdued and the central bank said it would take longer to hit its target than previously expected.
The crown initially rose after the announcement, as traders reacted to interest rates being left unchanged and the central bank's saying it saw the repo rate averaging -0.5 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly above a prior forecast of -0.52 percent.
But it then fell sharply, losing 0.8 percent on the day to trade at 9.8000 crowns per euro (EURNOK=D4), its weakest since May 2010. Against the dollar, it fell 0.6 percent to hit a 7-1/2-year low .
""The tone of the statement was rather dovish,"" said ING currency strategist Petr Krpata, in London. ""Although no QE extension was announced today, the statement sent a strong hint ... at more."" 
The dollar traded close to a three-month high against the yen, underpinned by higher U.S. bond yields and growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by the end of the year. 
The market is now pricing in a 78 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates at its December meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, following a series of hawkish comments from Fed policymakers. 
Those expectations have driven the dollar to nine-month highs against a basket of currencies (DXY) this week. Higher 10-year U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR), which rose to 1.813 percent in Asian trade, their highest since this month's five-month peak of 1.814 percent, have also supported the dollar.
""We're seeing a renewed pick-up in Fed rate hike expectations, which will likely intensify going into the November Fed meeting next week,"" Credit Agricole's head of G10 currency research, Valentin Marinov, said. 
""We will be looking for an explicit indication in the statement that rates will be going higher in December.""
Marinov said that the dollar was also being supported by a pick-up in corporate demand for dollar funding into the end of the year. 
Against the yen, the greenback rose 0.2 percent to 104.65 , just off its high of 104.875 touched on Tuesday. 

Norway's crown rose around half a percent after the central bank left interest rates unchanged and signaled that they would remain at their current levels in the period ahead. Against its Swedish counterpart, it climbed 1.5 percent to a its strongest since June 2015 (NOKSEK=).

617,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2016 02:20AM ET</span>",Yuan bearish bets at near ten-month high; Fed December hike views sting Asia forex sentiments: Reuters poll,"By Jongwoo Cheon
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bearish bets on China's yuan hit a near ten-month high in the last two weeks as the central bank guided it weaker to reflect a firm dollar, and sentiment toward most emerging Asian currencies stayed pessimistic with U.S. interest rates expected to rise.
The yuan's  short-positions rose to the largest since early January, showed a Reuters poll of 21 fund managers, analysts and currency traders conducted between Tuesday and Thursday. 
The yuan hit six-year lows in both onshore and offshore markets  this week as the People's Bank of China set its daily guidance rates at the weakest levels  since September 2010, in response to the dollar's recent strength.
The yuan's weakness spurred concerns over capital outflows and raised speculation that Beijing may allow the currency to depreciate further to support the world's second-largest economy, although large state-run banks were suspected of intervening to slow the yuan's decline, traders said. 
Chinese companies rushed to buy dollars for overseas investments and debt repayments.
The greenback (DXY) hovered around a nine-month peak against a basket of six major currencies as a recent series of solid U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve top officials' hawkish comments reinforced expectations that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates in December.
Bearish positions in the Singapore dollar's  rose to their largest since October last year, according to the survey.
The city-state's currency slumped last week to its weakest level against the dollar since March 3 on bets that the central bank may ease monetary policy amid growing risk of a recession.
The poll showed bearish bets on South Korea's won  were their largest since late May as foreign investors continued to sell local bonds.
Sentiment toward most other emerging Asian currencies remained pessimistic though bearish bets eased a bit on the U.S. dollar's recent retreat.
The Thai baht's  short positions more than halved on hopes for calm after some uncertainty following the death earlier this month of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch.
Bearish bets on the Philippine peso were slightly reduced due to speculation that President Rodrigo Duterte's foreign visits would generate an inflow of business, despite diplomatic strains with the United States.
The poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah , Taiwan dollar , Indian rupee , Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit  and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars.
The figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

620,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2016 11:08AM ET</span>","Dollar eases from highs on uncertainty over Fed, U.S. election","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday after touching a nearly nine-month high on Tuesday as the greenback looked vulnerable to weakness on uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve monetary policy and the U.S. election. 
Analysts said expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates this December were fully reflected in the dollar's recent rally, putting the currency at risk of losses if any contrary signals from Fed officials crop up between now and the end of the year. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.23 percent at 98.494 after touching 99.119 on Tuesday, its highest since Feb. 1. The index has risen about 3.2 percent this month, putting it on track for its best month in nearly a year. 
""The dollar is vulnerable to downside,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. ""What’s priced into it is a Fed rate rise in December, a Clinton victory, and neither of these is 100 percent guaranteed."" 
He said a potential surprise victory for U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump would hurt the dollar. 
Traders saw a 74 percent chance that the Fed would hike rates in December on Wednesday, down from a more than 78 percent chance on Tuesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
The euro <EUR=> was last up 0.32 percent against the dollar at $1.0921 after touching a six-day high of $1.0945 earlier in U.S. trading. That marked a rebound from a 7-1/2-month low of $1.0848 touched on Tuesday. 
The dollar was up 0.14 percent against the yen at 104.36 yen <JPY=>, but down from a roughly three-month high of 104.87 yen touched on Tuesday. The dollar was down 0.18 percent against the Swiss franc  at 0.9921 franc after hitting a 7-1/2-month high of 0.9998 franc on Tuesday. 
In addition to Fed and U.S. election uncertainty, recent stronger German business morale and import prices data may have led traders to trim short bets against the euro, said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in New York.
""The weak euro zone economy is showing a little more life,"" Franulovich said. 

Sterling  was last up 0.33 percent against the dollar at $1.2230. The pound pared losses on Tuesday after comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cast doubt on expectations for more monetary stimulus in Europe.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2016 05:49AM ET</span>",Impact on yuan from expected U.S. rate hike will be limited: central bank economist,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A potential U.S. interest rate hike in December will have limited impact on the yuan, the People's Bank of China chief economist Ma Jun told reporters on Tuesday. 
Speaking to a small group of foreign reporters at a luncheon, Ma said the yuan was under depreciation pressure ahead of the expected rate hike, but may recover when the Federal Reserve actually raises rates. Ma said he does not expect the Fed to be very aggressive on raising rates.
The impact on the yuan from a December rate hike will be limited because it has been anticipated and priced in by the market, he said.
""Emerging market currencies, including the yuan, have come under some pressure to depreciate before the Fed rate rise. Maybe they will rise after the rate hike,"" he said. 
The yuan's fall of more than 1.5 percent against the dollar since the end of September has renewed speculation in some quarters of a continued slide in the Chinese currency.
The yuan  has remained stable versus a currency basket in October despite falling against the dollar, which has been strengthening against major currencies amid expectations that the Fed might raise rates in December, Ma said.
The yuan's drop against the dollar shows the central bank is ""very faithful"" to its new currency regime, Ma said. Under the regime, the PBOC sets the yuan's daily mid-point versus the dollar based on the previous day's closing price, taking into account changes in major currencies.
Ma declined to comment on a specific level in the yuan exchange rate that the PBOC might tolerate. 
Policy sources have said earlier that the central bank would tolerate the yuan's fall to as low as 6.8 per dollar this year.
Ma also commented on China's efforts to rein in a red-hot property market after home prices rose at the fastest on record in September. 
Recent city-based property control measures in China will cool prices and demand for mortgages, Ma said, adding that the PBOC will consider the possible impact of monetary policy on the property sector.
""Changes in property prices will affect financial stability and financial stability is one of the central bank's important goals,"" he said.
Bank lending in recent months has been dominated by household lending, primarily mortgages. China's outstanding mortgage loans to individuals rose 33.4 percent to 17.93 trillion yuan ($2.65 trillion) from a year ago by the end of September, central bank data showed on Friday.
The banking regulator said on Saturday it had asked lenders to step up risk management of property loans amid record gains in house prices that have raised concerns of price bubbles and ballooning debts.

Ma also said that China's economy should grow about 6.7 percent in 2016 and average producer prices will likely show positive growth in 2017.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar held near nine-month highs against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday as solid U.S. manufacturing activity and comments from a Federal Reserve official cemented expectations of a U.S. rate hike by year-end.

Adding to the positive backdrop for the dollar, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Monday the Fed could raise rates three times between now and the end of 2017, so long as inflation expectations and the labour market continue to improve.
Evans' comments built on remarks by San Francisco Fed President John Williams on Friday and New York Fed President William Dudley on Oct. 19, both of whom hinted at a looming rate increase. 
As the dollar held firm, the euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.0876 , languishing near its seven-month low of $1.0859 touched on Friday.
The euro has come under renewed pressure after the European Central Bank last week kept the door open to more stimulus in December and doused speculation that it would taper its asset buying programme. 
""On the euro, now that it has decisively fallen below $1.10, we expect it to trade lower towards our eventual target of $1.05,"" said Heng Koon How, senior FX investment strategist for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Singapore. 
The dollar also had an edge against the yen, rising 0.3 percent to 104.48 yen , just below a 2-1/2-month high of 104.635 yen set earlier this month.
The dollar/yen's implied volatility fell sharply in the last few sessions to seven-month lows as more market players expect the currency pair to get stuck in a narrow trading range.
The one-month volatility  fell to 9.0 percent from around 11 percent just a week ago while the three-month volatility  fell to 9.7 percent from above 11 percent.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar  traded at C$1.3339, recovering from seven-month low of C$1.3398 touched on Monday.

Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Monday that a further easing from the Bank of Canada would bring the central bank closer to unconventional monetary policy and the decision on whether to cut rates again is not one to take lightly.

The yuan has been less volatile than other currencies this year amidst international events such as expectations of a rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and Britain's decision to quit the eurozone, Yi wrote in an article published in People's Daily on Tuesday.
Yi noted that the PBOC has continued with market-oriented reform and improved the exchange rate formation mechanism, including using the previous day's closing level and a basket of currencies to determine the yuan's exchange rate. That has strengthened ""regularity and transparency"" while stabilizing market expectations, he said.

The comments by Yi Gang in the People's Daily, the official paper of China's ruling Communist Party, came after a two-week slide in the yuan that shaved off more than 1.5 percent of its value against the dollar.
They echoed repeated statements by other top policymakers over the past year as the yuan has weakened substantially against the dollar.
""The Chinese currency has stayed stable against a basket of currencies. The yuan was less volatile than major reserve currencies, and its volatility was far below other emerging market currencies,"" Yi said.
On Monday, the yuan hit a fresh six year low against the dollar, drawing large dollar sales by state banks, which some traders suspected was being carried out on behalf of the central bank to support the currency.
The yuan's fall has been exacerbated by global uncertainties such as Britain's exit from the European Union, which battered most emerging currencies, but recent weakness has revived memories of China's surprise devaluation last August and another rapid depreciation early this year. 
Those declines in the yuan spread turmoil in global financial markets as investors fretted about deepening economic woes as growth slipped to a quarter-century low. 
Even before Brexit, most market watchers polled by Reuters had already expected Beijing would allow the yuan to weaken modestly this year as the economy continues to slow.
China Foreign Exchange Trade System data showed on Monday that the index for the yuan's value based on the market's trade-weighted basket stood at 94.30 on Friday, down 0.4 percent from the previous week.
Market confidence in the likelihood of a U.S. interest rate rise in December has also pressured the yuan with a recent Reuters poll showing the largest bearish positions in the currency since late July.
Yi said two-way volatility of the exchange rate against the dollar had increased over time.
Separately, Yi also said that China would maintain its prudent monetary policy while keeping ample liquidity in the financial system.

The government would strengthen its credit policy to support small and medium-sized enterprises, he said in the editorial.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2016 04:18AM ET</span>",Dollar heads for third weekly gain as U.S. rate rise bets firm,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar was on course for its third consecutive week of gains against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength on Friday, driven by hardening expectations of a rise in interest rates in December. 
In a year where investors have never really got close to fully pricing in a move, short-term U.S. rates now put a 75 percent probability on the Federal Reserve raising official borrowing costs for only the second time in more than a decade. 
After a blip in the first half of this week, comments by New York Fed President William Dudley and Donald Trump's failure to register a big win in Wednesday's presidential debate has hardened that view, fueling another surge for the greenback. 
European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's quashing of speculation it was already considering how to wind down bond purchases when the time comes also cooled any signs of recovery for the euro. 
""The dollar rally appears to be back on after it struggled at the start of this week,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index in London. 
By 0700 GMT, the dollar index (DXY) was up 0.1 percent on the day. The euro weakened 0.2 percent, having briefly traded below $1.09 for the first time since March.
Some analysts said that investors were again shifting towards ""carry"" trades that use the expanding difference between interest rates on the dollar and those in other currencies to rack up profit. 
""The euro was left bruised and battered after the October ECB meeting,"" analysts from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in a note to clients. 
""We suspect that the euro has also been dragged lower by its appeal as a funding currency at a time when the G10 FX carry trade is staging a return. This is consistent with the single currency having broken to new lows against G10 high-yielding and commodity currencies recently.""
Another reason for seeking the security of U.S. assets is the steady depreciation of China's yuan , which dropped to its lowest level in six years against the broadly stronger greenback.
Beijing spent almost a trillion of its dollar reserves fighting a fall in the currency to similar levels earlier this year but has moved to targeting a broader basket of currencies, meaning dollar gains globally naturally shift the exchange rate.
But with most trade with China still done in dollars that may not ease fears of another deflationary impulse for Western economies as a result. 
Sterling, whose 20 percent fall has been the biggest story of the past three months among the majors, was also back on the defensive in the face of the dollar's strength. 
The language from European officials towards Britain at Prime Minister Theresa May's first summit since June's vote for a Brexit from the EU did not augur well for the pound. French President Francois Hollande said if May wanted a ""hard"" Brexit, then negotiations would be very tough.

The pound, generally more stable this week, inched down 0.1 percent to $1.2241.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2016 08:08AM ET</span>","Euro near three-month lows, awaits ECB Draghi's views on QE","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro was trading just above a three-month low against the dollar on Thursday, with the focus on whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will indicate that the bank is poised to taper its bond purchase program.
The euro was flat at $1.0976 , having fallen to a three-month low of $1.0952 early in the London session. A drop below that mark, struck on July 25, would take the euro to its lowest point since the Brexit referendum results on June 24. 
As expected, the ECB held interest rates steady and did not make any changes to its asset purchase program. But investors want more clarity from Draghi about recent speculation that the bank could start tapering down its bond purchases. Draghi starts his press conference at 1230 GMT (0830 EDT).
Any indications that the governing council discussed tapering could see front-end yields on euro zone government bonds edge up, lifting the euro with it. There is also a chance Draghi may sound dovish too, with the ECB having downgraded growth forecasts only last month.
""I will not be surprised to see some bounce later on,"" said Niels Christensen, a currency strategist at Nordea. He expects Draghi to reiterate his commitment to looser monetary policy and quash talk of any tapering of the asset purchase program.
Analysts at HSBC said even if the ECB entertains the idea of a taper no matter how far into the future, it would help the euro. All of which meant a potentially choppy session was in store for the single currency. 
DOLLAR BID
Meanwhile, there was renewed bid for the dollar after the third and final debate in the U.S. election campaign between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.
It was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 103.63 yen  and against a basket of currencies it was at 97.906, not far from a recent 7-month high. (DXY)
Since most recent polls have favored Clinton, the market's focus had been on whether Trump would be able to use the debate to regain momentum in the final weeks before the Nov. 8 vote.
""There didn't seem to be anything in the latest debate that put Clinton in a tight spot,"" said Kota Hirayama, senior economist for SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
A CNN snap poll of debate watchers found Clinton won with 52 percent, and Trump trailed with 39 percent, the network said.
The Mexican peso, which is closely watched because Mexico is seen as most vulnerable to Trump's economic policy proposals, rose to 18.4555  to the dollar at one point, its highest level since Sept. 8. It was last trading 0.2 percent lower.
The dollar was also helped by bullish comments from one of the most influential officials on the Federal Reserve. New York Fed President William Dudley said the Fed will likely raise interest rates later this year if the economy remains on track.

Dudley, a permanent voter on policy and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said a quarter-point hike this year ""is not really that big a deal"" given the economy is ""reasonably close"" to the Fed's goals of 2 percent inflation and maximum sustainable employment.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar index was subdued on Wednesday as Treasury yields ticked lower after U.S. consumer prices suggested underlying inflation was moderating, prompting investors to trim bets on an interest rate hike later this year.
The index (DXY) was down 0.1 percent at 97.809, below Monday's seven-month high of 98.169. Against the yen, it was down 0.3 percent at 103.55 yen  while the euro was slightly higher at $1.0985 
The dollar struggled to gain traction in the wake of U.S. inflation data on Wednesday. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, gained 0.1 percent last month after climbing 0.3 percent in August. The year-on-year increase in the core CPI slowed to 2.2 percent following a 2.3 percent rise in August. 
Fed fund futures <0#FF:> imply around a 65 percent probability of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by December, down from 70 percent before the CPI data.
""The U.S. data has not been great and U.S. rates have eased on the back of that. That has seen dollar/yen come under some pressure, but we expect some decent buying around the 103-103.50 yen level,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura.
Goto added there was a slight upside risk to the common currency before the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. The central bank is widely expected to keep its policy unchanged with any decisions on the future of its asset purchase scheme expected to be deferred until December.
But some traders expect ECB chief Mario Draghi to clarify his stance on recent talk that the ECB is considering tapering its asset purchases.
CHINA DATA
The Australian dollar held on to recent gains after a barrage of Chinese data. China's third-quarter gross domestic product matched market forecasts, while September industrial production came in below expectations.
Hirofumi Suzuki, an economist for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore said the data suggested Chinese authorities still have solid control over the economy and that the risks of a sharp deterioration are limited. That bodes well for the Aussie dollar in the near term, he said.
The Australian dollar last traded at $0.7670 , slightly higher on the day. Earlier on Wednesday, it rose to $0.7691 at one point, matching its high on Oct. 4.

The CFTC data showed speculators cut yen net longs to 45,000 contracts from roughly 70,000 the prior week.
""For now, support for dollar/yen is likely to come from passive selling of the yen involving winding down of positions, rather than active, speculative selling,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
""A December Fed rate hike is mostly priced in by the market. The key to further dollar strength is how far U.S. long-term rates can climb.""
Also lifting the dollar on Friday, the 10-year (US10YT=RR) and 30-year Treasury yields (US30YT=RR) reached four-month highs after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested the Fed may allow inflation to exceed its 2 percent target. [US/]
""The schedule this week isn't packed with strong U.S. data releases, and the market focus is likely to center around three events,"" said Shin Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
""These would be Wednesday's China GDP data, the ECB policy meeting after recent talk of tapering and the last U.S. presidential debate, which would give the market a chance to confirm if Clinton has the lead over Trump.""
The third and final U.S. presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump takes place late on Wednesday (U.S. time) and the ECB holds its policy meeting on Thursday.
Clinton maintained a substantial projected advantage in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency, according to the latest results from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.
Elsewhere, the pound slipped 0.3 percent to $1.2156 . Sterling, dogged by prospects of a complex and potentially chaotic exit by Britain from the European Union, had lost nearly 2 percent last week.

The Australian dollar was down 0.4 percent at $0.7586 , trimming some of its gains made on Friday on the back of a bounce in commodity prices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators lifted favorable bets on the U.S. dollar for a third straight week, with net longs hitting their highest in more than eight months, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
The value of the dollar's net long position rose to $14.72 billion in the week ended Oct. 11, from $10.52 billion the previous week.
The dollar has been underpinned by recent strong U.S. economic data that cemented expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its December monetary policy meeting.
So far this month, the dollar index (DXY) is up 2.7 percent, on pace for its best monthly percentage gain since May.
""We are bullish U.S. dollars but it will be important to watch Treasury yields - if they fall, the dollar could experience losses, but if 10-year yields hit fresh four-month highs, we can expect strong gains in the greenback,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar on Friday posted its best weekly performance in more than seven months after strong U.S. retail sales and producer prices data for September reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December.
The U.S. currency briefly trimmed gains versus the Japanese yen and euro after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the U.S. central bank might need to run a ""high-pressure"" economy to reverse damage from the last financial crisis.
Her view of the economy did not alter expectations for a December rate hike, analysts said.
""Yellen's comments were more about the Fed looking down the road, and her concerns about the last financial crisis shed light on why the Fed has been so hesitant to raise interest rates,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.4 percent to 97.935 (DXY). It was up 1.4 percent for the week and 2.5 percent for the month so far.
The safe-haven yen  and Swiss franc  fell versus the dollar after risk sentiment got a boost from Chinese data showing producer prices rose for the first time in nearly five years. That boded well for the global economy which has been battling the threat of deflation in recent months.
The U.S. retail sales data, which showed a 0.6 percent rise last month after declining 0.2 percent in August, supported the dollar's gains. Other data on Friday suggested a pickup in inflation, with producer prices rising broadly last month to record their biggest year-on-year increase since December 2014.
The minutes of the latest Fed meeting in September, released on Wednesday, prompted investors to raise their bets of a U.S. rate increase in December, to a 70 percent chance.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.3 percent to 104.03 . It was up 1.2 percent for the week.

The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.0992 , after earlier hitting $1.0983, its weakest level since late July. It was down 1.6 percent for the week, its worst weekly performance since late February.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2016 11:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russia may borrow in yuan this year for first time,"By Yelena Orekhova and Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia may borrow Chinese yuan for the first time ever by the end of 2016, a Russian finance ministry official said, a step towards Moscow's ambition of using Asian credit markets to compensate for its limited access to Western funding.
Russia needs new sources of cash as low crude oil prices lead to widening shortfalls in the budget. Its access to Western capital markets is restricted by Western sanctions imposed on it over the conflict in Ukraine.
One option the finance ministry may choose is selling treasury bonds, known as OFZs, denominated in the Chinese currency, later this year, Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of the state debt department at the finance ministry, told Reuters. 
Moscow may raise the equivalent of $1 billion in yuan through the OFZs, money that the finance ministry would convert into rubles, Vyshkovsky said.
Russia has drawn closer to China, painting it as its close partner, after Moscow's relations with the West were soured by its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its support of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
But Moscow's pivot towards Asia has not gone smoothly, in part because Asian credit markets are much shallower than the Western debt markets that Russia has turned to in the past when it needed to borrow.
Russia raised $3 billion through a dollar-denominated Eurobond this year, but the issue was complicated by the fact that many major financial institutions were wary of taking part because of sanctions risk.
Under a plan set by the finance ministry, Russia will not raise any more foreign debt this year, so the yuan-denominated OFZs, which are considered domestic borrowing, would be a timely supplement for the budget.
The money raised may help avoid a greater budget deficit, which this year will exceed the ceiling of three percent of gross domestic product that had been initially set by President Vladimir Putin. 
Russia's Reserve Fund is running out and low prices for crude oil, its key export, are putting pressure on the budget. The finance ministry had said it will respond by increasing borrowing and will also try to proceed with selling state stakes in major Russia companies.
The OFZ bonds would be issued as part of additional borrowing worth 200 billion rubles ($3.21 billion), Vyshkovsky said.
The extra borrowing program for the fourth quarter was approved in September after Russia had nearly reached its full-year borrowing limit of 300 billion rubles in the domestic market in the first three quarters.
Sovereign rouble bonds enjoyed strong demand this year thanks to high yields linked to the central bank interest rates . The central bank has been reluctant to cut rates quickly, given risks that inflation won't slow to its ambitious target an all-time low of 4 percent in 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday, ticking up with Treasury yields and on track for weekly gains, as investors await U.S. retail sales data and remarks from Federal Reserve officials that could cement expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike this year.
The safe haven yen  and the Swiss franc  were under pressure after risk sentiment got a boost from Chinese data that showed producer prices rising for the first time in nearly five years. That boded well for the global economy which has been battling the threat of deflation in recent months.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, added 0.4 percent to 97.874 (DXY). It was not far from a seven-month high of 98.129 touched on Thursday, and up 1 percent for the week, and more than 2 percent for the month so far. 
Retail sales data would offer some insight on the strength of U.S. consumption. Following the data, Fed Chair Janet Yellen will address an economics conference, at which Boston Fed governor Eric Rosengren will also speak. 
The minutes of the latest Fed meeting in September, released on Wednesday, prompted investors to raise their bets of a Fed rate increase at its December policy meeting. Markets are now pricing in around a 70 percent chance that the Fed will move.
""Markets are looking for a solid rebound in US consumer spending, with the headline retail sales print likely to pick up,"" said Viraj Patel, currency strategist at ING.
""With consumption now a key engine for growth, we've noted that dollar crosses have been more sensitive to surprises in recent U.S. retail sales reports. So any upside in today’s release could sustain the dollar's upward momentum.""

Traders said with dollar/yen pushing steadily higher, investors who have been building bets in favor of the yen in recent weeks are likely to cut those positions, giving another leg up to the greenback.
""Positioning is a concern for us,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note. ""With the markets extremely long the yen currently, it will only take a small rise in dollar/yen for positioning to start to adjust.""

714,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2016 03:30PM ET</span>",Dollar slides from seven-month peak on weak Chinese trade data,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled from a seven-month high on Thursday, as risk appetite took a turn for the worse after soft Chinese trade data spooked a market that is expecting an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve by the end of the year.
The dollar index posted its largest daily percentage loss in a month.
The U.S. currency also fell from a more than two-month high against the yen and Swiss franc, two safe-haven currencies that benefit in times of political or financial stress. 
""A significant slowdown in Chinese growth could once again foil the plans of U.S. authorities to stabilize monetary policy,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.
""Still it may be premature to consider such a possibility, but today's news certainly sets the stage for a deeper correction in the dollar,"" Schlossberg added.
Exports from China, the world's second largest economy, fell 5.6 percent in yuan terms in September from a year earlier and 10 percent in dollars. 
The dollar has gained more than two percent so far this month against a basket of currencies, boosted by U.S. rate hike expectations. Investors have priced in a roughly 70 percent chance the Fed would nudge rates higher at its December policy meeting, a prospect reinforced by Wednesday's release of the last Fed monetary policy meeting minutes.
Minutes of the Fed's September meeting showed that the Federal Open Market Committee was deeply divided over the timing of the next interest rate hike, as several members agreed the Fed should raise rates in the near term if U.S. data continued to strengthen.
That said, Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX.com in New York pointed out the Fed ""maybe sounding hawkish on the front end, but increasingly dovish on the long end.""
Vecchio believes U.S. productivity growth remains low and ""with material labor market slack remaining, the U.S. may be stuck in a period of lower growth."" That should cap the dollar's upside in the medium to long term.
In late trading, the dollar index fell 0.4 percent to 97.538 (DXY), after notching a seven-month peak earlier in the session.
The dollar was last down 0.5 percent against the yen at 103.61 yen , after hitting its strongest level since late July.
The U.S. currency also fell from 2-1/2 month peaks versus the Swiss franc and last changed hands at 0.9863 franc, down 0.4 percent.

The euro fell briefly below $1.10 for the first time since July, but quickly recovered to trade 0.4 percent higher on the day at $1.1052 .

727,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2016 07:09AM ET</span>","Sterling firms as May offers scrutiny on Brexit, dollar buoyant","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The struggling pound rose on Wednesday following a brutal sell-off, as British Prime Minister Theresa May's offer to give lawmakers some scrutiny of the process to leave the European Union calmed market fears of a ""hard Brexit"".
Those fears - that Britain will give up full access to the EU's single market - pushed sterling to 31-year lows last week, including on Friday when it lost 10 percent within minutes.
A court will rule on Thursday whether May can trigger Article 50, initiating the process of separating Britain from the European Union, without the consent of parliament. A spokeswoman for May said there will be no vote in Britain's parliament on triggering the formal Brexit talks.
Many lawmakers seem to favor a ""soft Brexit"" or no Brexit at all and investors fear the ""hard"" option could hurt trade and foreign investment needed to fund Britain's huge current account deficit, one of the biggest in the developed world. 
Sterling was up 1.2 percent at $1.2270 , after having tumbled to $1.2086 on Tuesday when it appeared it was heading back towards a 31-year low of $1.1450 hit on Friday. The euro too was down 1.5 percent at 80.97 pence (EURGBP=D4)
""After weeks of tough rhetoric pushing sterling into a trading environment closer to an emerging market currency, the government may aim to stabilize markets, with its rhetoric and suggestions now possibly shifting in tone,"" Morgan Stanley's head of currency strategy, Hans Redeker, said.
""However, there is a fine line to walk as May's Conservative Party wants a clean split from Europe. In addition, giving in too much, even before Article 50 negotiations have started, shifts the negotiation advantage towards the EU. Hence, the pound's rebound should be limited and followed by a decline.""
Elsewhere, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hit a 7-month high of 97.817 (DXY), its highest since early March. The euro was trading down at $1.1015 , an 11-week low, while against the yen, it was slightly higher at 103.55 
The dollar had been on an uptrend on rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates as early as this year, with markets pricing in about a 70-percent chance of a hike in December. 
Investors await the minutes of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's September meeting, scheduled to be released later on Wednesday, as well as U.S. retail sales data on Friday.
""Since the market is still not fully priced for a December rate hike, it seems reasonable to assume that the dollar may still have some upside potential between now and year end,"" Rabobank said in a note.

""However, we expect that this will be limited by the perception that the pace of Fed tightening is likely to remain slow.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar hit an 11-week high on Tuesday as investors increased bets that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December following a round of generally solid U.S. economic data over the last few weeks.
Sterling continued its downward trek following a ""flash crash"" event last Friday, with investors concerned about the impact of a ""hard exit"" by Britain from the European Union. Over the past week, the British pound has lost more than four percent of its value against the dollar.
In the United States, investors are also looking to Wednesday's release of the minutes of the latest Fed monetary policy meeting for confirmation of the market's December rate hike view. The rate futures market has attached a roughly 70 percent probability the Fed will lift rates at the December meeting
That pushed benchmark U.S. 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) to a more than four-month high elevating the dollar against the yen, the currency pair most sensitive to moves in the U.S. government bond market. The greenback has risen in 10 of the last 11 sessions versus the Japanese currency. 
""Recent data on jobs, manufacturing and services growth have shown compelling strength that could green light a U.S. rate hike by the end of the year,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
Speaking to reporters after a speech in Sydney, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said he ""could be fine"" with the Fed raising rates in December, but he wanted to see how the economy and inflation progressed before deciding.
Analysts also said the dollar has benefited as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton widened her lead in opinion polls over her rival, Republican candidate Donald Trump.
""To the extent that Mrs. Clinton is seen as the status quo candidate, her victory is likely to create fewer policy uncertainties than Mr. Trump's and is therefore likely to create fewer possible objections to higher interest rates at the Fed come December's FOMC meeting,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2016 06:07AM ET</span>","South African finance minister issued with summons, rand plunges","By Joe Brock
PRETORIA (Reuters) - South African prosecutors issued Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan with a formal summons on Tuesday to appear in court on Nov. 2 in relation to the granting of early retirement to a colleague, sending the rand reeling.
The currency fell as much as 3.4 percent when prosecutor Shaun Abrahams also told a news conference that Gordhan was being investigated for his role in setting up a surveillance unit at the tax department a decade ago.
Abrahams said Gordhan, in his previous role as head of the South African Revenue Service (SARS), would be charged with approving early-retirement for former tax agency deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay and then re-appointing him as a consultant.
This cost the tax agency around 1.1 million rand ($79,000), in violation of public finance laws, Abrahams said.
An elite police unit known as the Hawks also has also been investigating Gordhan over the so-called ""rogue spy unit"" at the tax agency, set up when he was at its helm. Abrahams said the probe on the unit was continuing.
Gordhan was first asked questions by the Hawks about the SARS unit in February, an investigation analysts say was the result of political pressure from a faction allied to President Jacob Zuma. The president has denied the claims.
The affair, which has rumbled on for months, has rattled markets in Africa's most industrialized country, which faces the risk of ratings downgrades later this year.
Gordhan, who is highly respected by financial markets, has painted the allegations about his role in establishing the special tax unit as ""political mischief"" but said prosecution officials delivered a summons to his house on Tuesday morning.
""It looks like we are in for a bit of excitement going forward,"" he said at a business seminar in Johannesburg. ""My lawyers will issue a proper statement in a short while.""
Abrahams denied any mischief in the handling of the case, and said the surveillance unit acted in a ""very strange manner"" and without clearance from the national intelligence services.
""I can assure you there has been no political interference in this matter. There has been no political interference in the decision made,"" Abrahams said.
In line with the weaker rand, South Africa's government and dollar bonds also fell sharply, while the cost of insuring exposure to South African debt leapt to three-month highs.

Investors and rating agencies back Gordhan's plans to rein in government spending in an economy that has been forecast by the central bank to grow at just above zero percent this year.

749,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2016 04:33AM ET</span>",Sterling index at lowest since Jan 2009 as Brexit woes persist,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling's trade-weighted index fell to its lowest since early 2009 on Monday, extending hefty losses seen last week, on deepening worry about an adverse impact on the British economy from its exit from the European Union.
The currency was slightly calmer than Friday when a ""flash-crash"" wiped out a tenth of its value in a matter of minutes in Asian trade, but sentiment towards the pound remained gloomy with speculators bets against it at record highs. [IMM/FX].
Sterling index fell to 74.2 <=GBP> its lowest since Jan 2009 and down 0.7 percent on the day. The index has lost over 9 percent since the referendum results on June 24 where Britons voted to leave the EU.
The drop in the index reflected sterling's broad struggles. It was down 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.2410  while the euro was flat at 90 pence (EURGBP=). Against the dollar, sterling hit a low of $1.1491 on Friday, its lowest since 1985, and posted its worst weekly loss since the Brexit vote.
Losses accelerated last week on worries about how Britain will exit the EU and about Prime Minister Theresa May's comments on loose monetary policy, which some saw as a thinly veiled attack on the Bank of England. 
Many investors think May's government is leaning towards a ""Hard Brexit"", where Britain gives up full access to the EU's single market in order to impose maximum control on its borders. Some fear that could hinder trade and constrict the foreign investment needed to fund Britain's huge current account deficit, one of the biggest in the developed world.
""'Hard' Brexit fears are unlikely to abate anytime soon and in the near term there is scope for another 2-3 percent risk premium to be built into sterling/dollar and euro/sterling,"" said Chris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING, adding last week saw an estimated 4-5 percent risk premium being priced in as per their financial models.
When investors are nervous or cautious about putting money into country's assets they demand higher premiums for their investments which often can lead to a cheaper or weaker currency.
A few large banks have lowered their forecasts for the pound. HSBC, a leading British bank, said on Friday it forecast the pound to drop to $1.10 and parity against the euro by the end of 2017, citing growing uncertainty from Brexit.
Traders said sentiment was unlikely to turn around soon with the options market indicating some more weakness. Six-month sterling/dollar risk reversals, capturing the date by which Britain is expected to formally begin the process of leaving the EU, showing a bias for more weakness. 

Risk reversals are a gauge of the balance in the market between options betting on a currency rising or falling. The six-month risk reversal stood at -1.8 vols on Monday, down from -2.2 on Friday, according to ICAP (LON:IAP) data, but still showing its greatest bias towards sterling weakness since July. A negative number indicates a bias for a weaker pound.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound inched lower on Monday as the dollar took back some of Friday's losses against a range of currencies, while the Mexican peso surged after the damaging publication a video of Donald Trump making vulgar comments about women. 
The Bank of England's trade-weighted index, which did not price during sterling's 10-percent off-session crash in Asian time on Friday, hit its lowest since early 2009 as worries about the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union weighed.
""I guess that we have to prepare for further weakness,"" said Hans Redeker, head of G10 currency strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in London.
""The course is now certainly going to lower levels and $1.20 (per pound) should certainly be taken into consideration.""
After recovering following soft U.S. jobs numbers that weakened the dollar in U.S. time on Friday, sterling traded 0.3 percent lower than the previous close at $1.2390.  It was also down 0.1 percent at 90.16 pence per euro. (EURGBP=)
That compared with the flash crash lows of respectively $1.1491 and 94.03 pence per euro. 
The Mexican peso, a sufferer since May due to Trump's promises to clamp down on immigration and rethink trade relations, surged as markets trimmed the chances of a victory for the Republican nominee in next month's elections.
The Mexican currency  rose about 2 percent to 18.91 to the U.S. dollar at one point in early Asian trade - its highest level in nearly a month - and held on to the bulk of its gains after the second presidential debate between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton ended. 
It last stood at 19.018, still up around 1.5 percent.
The peso is unlikely to break above the trading ranges seen since June, even if more position-squaring takes place, said Wu Mingze, FX trader of global payments for financial services provider INTL FCStone in Singapore.
""A full-unwinding of the 'Trump Trades' should only bring us to the levels between the 18.00-19.00 consolidation zone,"" he said.
In a video released on Friday, Trump is heard talking on an open microphone in 2005 about groping females and trying to seduce a married woman. 
The controversy pitched Trump into the biggest crisis of his 16-month-old campaign and deepened fissures between him and establishment Republicans.
The Canadian dollar rose around 0.2 percent to C$1.3268 to the U.S. dollar, edging away from Friday's low of C$1.3315, its lowest level since mid-March. 
""Our base case remains...a Fed rate hike in December followed by another two more hikes next year,"" said Heng Koon How, senior FX investment strategist for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).

If a slight tightening of U.S. monetary policy is accompanied by potential fiscal stimulus, it could set the stage for the dollar to strengthen next year, he added.

Last week, the U.S. dollar declined against a basket of major currencies on Friday, retreating from a more than two-month peak after U.S. employment data for September disappointed analysts’ expectations, while the British pound plunged after what traders called a ""flash crash"" knocked the currency to a 31-year low.
The U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs last month, down from a gain of 167,000 in August, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.0%, the Labor Department said Friday. Market analysts had expected 176,000 new jobs and the jobless rate to hold at 4.9%.
Despite the lackluster report, the slowdown was not expected to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates later this year. Markets are currently pricing in around a 65.1% chance of a rate hike at December's meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

The currency moved after markets in Asia began Monday trading. At 3 p.m. CDT (2000 GMT), the peso had strengthened 1.89 percent to 18.955 per dollar.
Republican nominee Donald Trump has vowed he would build a wall on the border with Mexico and renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement if he is elected. 

The United States is Mexico's main trading partner and Wall Street analysts say concern over any potential trade restrictions have hurt the peso.

""Based on our own experience, it takes some time to find out why such movements occur,"" Lew told a news conference at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Meetings in Washington.
The pound's fall by more than 10 percent against the dollar to below $1.15 was not in line with a largely stable exchange rate picture in recent weeks, Lew said. 
""In general, we've seen exchange rates behaving in a stable way globally responding to macro-economic movements,"" he said.
Lew said that despite some rhetoric coming from British politicians in favor of a ""hard Brexit"" with less economic integration and more immigration restrictions, the Obama administration continues to recommend for ""the parties to remain in an amicable discussion, in pursuit of a highly integrated outcome.""
The more that UK-EU separation discussions provide a sense that such an outcome will occur, the more confidence it will instill in markets, Lew said.
The U.S. Treasury chief also said that many more countries are now willing to take additional steps to boost chronically weak growth.
He praised Japan, China and Germany for recent fiscal steps they have taken to boost consumption, but said South Korea could do more. Most countries, even those with constrained budgets can take some steps to increase growth, he said. 

""There are more tools that could be used to help stimulate global growth,"" Lew said.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2016 04:40PM ET</span>",'Flash crash' thrashes sterling; dollar slides on U.S. jobs data,"By Richard Leong and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sterling plunged on Friday after what traders called a ""flash crash"" knocked the currency to a 31-year low, while the dollar slipped on news of unexpectedly weak U.S. jobs growth in September. 
Even before a sudden plunge that briefly shaved off a tenth of the pound's value during Asian trading, sterling was headed for its worst week since January 2009 as some national leaders called for Britain to make a ""hard"" exit from the European Union.
""I think it’s a warning shot from the markets to the UK about what type of potential volatility in sterling we may see down the line,"" said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of FX strategy at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in New York.
With the focus on sterling, the U.S. non-farm payrolls report took something of a back seat. At 156,000 new U.S. jobs for the month of September, the headline number was softer than the market forecast, but strong enough to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise rates in December.
On Friday, the pound plunged about 10 percent from levels around $1.2600 to $1.1378  in a matter of minutes in thin early Asian trading.
Thomson Reuters later revised that low to $1.1491, which was still the weakest level for sterling since 1985. The company, which owns the Reuters foreign exchange brokerage platform RTSL, said an outlying trade had been canceled. 
In late trading, sterling recouped some of its losses to trade at $1.2442, still down 1.5 percent on the day.
The pound pared earlier losses as other currencies strengthened against the dollar in reaction to data showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls rising 156,000 in September, below the 175,000 increase forecast among analysts polled by Reuters.
""Although the initial reading of the September employment market was lower than estimates..., it is likely in the sweet spot for FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) hawks that would like to get a second rate hike in before year-end,"" said Marvin Loh, senior global markets strategist, at BNY Mellon in Boston.
""Other internals of the current report are also supportive for the case of a December hike.""
In late trading, the dollar index (DXY) was down 0.3 percent at 96.501. It rose to a more than two-month high shortly before the release of the payrolls report.
The greenback fell sharply against the yen, down 1 percent at 102.91 yen. <JPY=>
The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.1198 but fell 0.6 percent against the Japanese currency to 115.26 yen. <EUR=> (EURJPY=) 

Encouraging aspects of the September payrolls report, which showed a higher participation rate and steady 0.2 percent rise in wages, limited the dollar's loss and supported market expectations for a Fed hike at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2016 08:40PM ET</span>","Australia, New Zealand dollar forecasts turn less bearish as yield appeal grows","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts are moderating their usually bearish outlook on the Australian and New Zealand dollars as investors desperately search for yield in a low interest rate world.
A Reuters poll of 52 analysts saw the Aussie  at 76 U.S. cents in one month, one cent higher than in the September poll.
Still, the general expectations were that it would ease over time, reaching $0.7450 in three months and $0.7335 in six months and $0.7200 in one year.
The Aussie has been in demand as many central banks across the globe keep monetary policy ultra-easy to ward off deflation and support growth. 
Also underpinning the Aussie were revised expectations of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve. Some had wagered the Fed would have raised rates as early as September but that did not occur and traders are now pricing in around a 60 percent chance of a move in December.
With so much monetary easing in the world and the threat of deflation at home, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut rates twice this year to a record low of 1.5 percent. It held rates steady earlier this week, but expectations are for another easing although not for some time.
But with Australia's AAA-rated government bonds yielding well above rich world peers, the Aussie was hovering around 76 cents and among 2016's best-performing major currencies - rising around 4 percent.
Ten-year Australian bonds (AU10YT=RR) yield 2.1 percent against 1.7 percent in the United States (US10YT=RR), 0.8 percent in the UK and around zero in Japan and Germany.
A similar yield appeal is seen supporting the New Zealand dollar . The poll of 45 analysts produced a one-month forecast of 72 U.S. cents to the New Zealand dollar, before gradually slipping to 69 within a year. The previous poll saw it reaching 67 cents in that time. 
Again, the market is more optimistic, having taken the kiwi to $0.7160 currently, from a low of $0.6676 in May. It recently touched its highest in 15 months at $0.7485, a level that has met stiff resistance.
Much of the currency's strength came from upbeat economic data at home even though the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) said it would cut interest rates again from 2.00 percent currently. The RBNZ Governor reiterated last week that further easing would be needed to deflect deflation risk.
New Zealand's 10-year bonds offer an even fatter yield of 2.50 percent (NZ10YT=RR), the highest in the developed world.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2016 09:00AM ET</span>","Bias still toward stronger U.S. dollar, but gains petering out: Reuters Poll","By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The dollar is likely to rise a bit further, but a tame U.S. rate hike outlook at a time of waning firepower from those global central banks still easing policy will limit its gains, according to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists. 
The Fed is still poised to pull the trigger in December, but its lingering hesitation in delivering even one rate hike this year after suggesting initially that four were in the pipeline has pushed the dollar down over 2 percent so far in 2016.
""Even though the Fed is likely to normalize rates further by hiking in December...markets should remain skeptical about the speed and the aggressiveness of its tightening cycle over the longer-term,"" said David Forrester, FX strategist at CA-CIB.
""In addition, the ECB and the BoJ are running out of options to ease aggressively further. Taken as a whole, the G10 central bank backdrop could reduce the positive impact on U.S. dollar from any future Fed tightening.""
Forecasts for the dollar to rise further against major currencies have been whittled away in the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections next month, but a majority of analysts still expect it to edge higher. 
The latest positioning data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed currency speculators have increased outright bullish bets for the U.S. dollar to the highest in six weeks at the expense of the euro.
But the latest Reuters poll of 65 currency strategists is the third consecutive survey that forecasters have bumped up their euro  calls slightly.
The consensus is for the single currency, which is up around 3 percent this year, to weaken against the dollar to $1.09 over the coming 12 months from $1.12 on Thursday.
By the end 2016, the euro is also expected to be higher than where it started the year, marking the first calendar year of gains for the currency since 2013. That comes despite the European Central Bank's extraordinary stimulus measures.
There is a clear sense now among analysts, traders and investors that the potency of further monetary easing from major central banks is on the wane.
Indeed, while the Bank of Japan rebooted its policy framework last month by introducing a target for 10-year JGB yields of around zero percent, forecasts in the latest poll are for a stronger yen than predicted in January.
Then, analysts were calling for the yen to fall against the dollar to 125 in 12 months. Now they are expecting it to weaken to 105.0 from 103.6 on Thursday. The yen is up almost 14 percent this year.
Meanwhile, the battered pound is expected to tumble to new multi-decade lows in the coming months on concerns that Britain's exit from the European Union could get messy. [GBP/POLL]
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which would formally begin the two-year countdown to Brexit - would be triggered by the end of March, pushing the British pound  to below $1.27 on Wednesday for the first time in over three decades.
The latest poll showed sterling would fall as low as $1.24 in the run-up to that.
""I'm slightly surprised the pound hasn't bounced from its fall ... but not surprised enough to prevent me being bearish long-term. To be fair, absolutely no-one is going to change their view of the UK economy, sterling or the wider implications of 'Brexit' until there are mountains of evidence about the economic impact,"" wrote Kit Juckes, global head of FX strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar ground higher on Thursday, extending this week's four-week highs against the yen before a jobs report many expect to help seal the case for a rise in U.S. interest rates in December. 
Rises in U.S. Treasury yields over the past 10 days have been the main driver of a halt in the yen's steady progress this year, pushing the Japanese currency back from 100 yen per dollar to 103.77  on Thursday.
The yen was also within sight of Wednesday's five-week lows against the euro, but in general moves across the major currencies were subdued. 
""Obviously, the big focus is the U.S. jobs data tomorrow, so the market is likely to be in wait-and-see mode today,"" said Alexandre Dolci, a strategist with Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) in London.
""If we do have this double-whammy of positive headlines from the U.S. data tomorrow - a strong NFP (non-farm payrolls) number and a further pick- up in average earnings - then we may see the dollar strengthen into the end of the week.""
The dollar index, which measures its broader strength against a basket of currencies, rose 0.25 percent to 96.352. Against the euro it gained just over 0.1 percent to $1.1189.
Analysts from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) argued that the fall in the yen was being driven by a drop in hedging activity as U.S. yields rose. 
""Over the course of the past few weeks, US front-end rates have moved higher as the market prices in a 65 percent probability of the Fed hiking rates by December,"" they said in a morning note. 
""This repricing has primarily driven low-yielding currencies. The yen has come under significant selling pressure, supported further by foreigners net selling 1.89 trillion yen of Japanese money market instruments.""
Prime Minister Theresa May gave the pound - the big loser among the major currencies in the past fortnight - a small bump on Wednesday by warning of the negative side-effects of ultra-low interest rates. 
But signs that the government is ready to prioritise controls on immigration over membership of the European Union's single market continue to dominate minds, and it sank to another 31-year low of $1.2663 soon after the start of U.S. trade. 
""My base case is that it is going to be extremely hard for the UK to escape recession. The first two quarters of next year are going to be extremely negative,"" said Davis Hall, Head of FX and Precious Metals at wealth manager Indosuez in Geneva.

""Our ultra high net worth clients that have sterling, at these levels we are not advising them to sell; the additional downside below $1.25 is limited. But we're not expecting a massive recovery either, we have (forecast) $1.32 in six months.""

783,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2016 04:30AM ET</span>",Sterling falls below $1.27 for first time since 1985,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pound dipped below $1.27 for the first time since June 1985 on Wednesday, with fears of a 'hard' Brexit also pushing the currency to a five-year trough against a broadly stronger euro.
Sterling has been buffeted for a fortnight by worries that Britain will prioritize curbing immigration over promoting trade in its divorce from the bloc, thereby gumming up labor markets, curbing foreign investment and leading to cutbacks by banks and other global companies.
That has been the broad takeaway for markets from this week's conference of the ruling Conservative Party, and the pound has fallen past long-term lows set in early July in response, although there were signs of stability in morning trade in London.
Sterling hit a 31-year low of $1.2686  after opening before recovering to $1.2720, roughly flat on the day. It fell as much as 0.4 percent to 88.31 pence per euro (EURGBP=D4) before also clawing back some ground against the common currency.
""Sterling has finally and belatedly responded to the heightened and prolonged Brexit uncertainty, notwithstanding a resilient UK economy and prospects of significant UK fiscal stimulus,"" said Greg Gibbs, director of independent research house Amplifying Global FX Capital. 
""The outlook remains negative, but it is risky to jump on the selling bandwagon.""
Better than expected readings of sentiment among construction and manufacturing purchasing managers this week have done little to turn the mood brighter. Services numbers are due at 0830 GMT.
Britain's financial industry could lose up to 38 billion pounds ($48.3 billion) in revenue in a 'hard' Brexit that would leave it with restricted access to the European Union's single market, according to a report on Tuesday commissioned by consultancy firm Oliver Wyman. 
""UK PMI data is unlikely to be a game changer,"" analysts from French bank  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in a morning note.
""Any better than expected reading may trigger some position squaring related upside in the pound. However, with rate expectations linked to long-term uncertainty and as fears of a hard Brexit remain intact, it seems unlikely that sentiment is changing for the better.""

784,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2016 04:23AM ET</span>","Euro makes broad gains, rises to five-year high against sterling","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro soared to a five-year peak against the struggling pound on Wednesday and scaled a three-week high against the yen, bolstered by rising euro zone government bond yields.
Euro zone bond yields rose to two-week highs in early trade, with investors on edge a day after a Bloomberg article cited sources as saying the central bank would probably wind down its bond buying gradually before ending quantitative easing. 
However, an ECB media officer said in tweet later on Tuesday that the ECB had not discussed reducing the pace of its monthly bond buying. 
Nevertheless, rising German bund yields saw rate differentials move in favor of the euro, giving it a leg up so that it was 0.4 percent higher against the pound at 88.31 pence, a level last seen five years ago, and at 115.545 yen, its highest in three weeks.
The euro was also 0.2 percent higher against the dollar at $1.1226.
""The headlines that the ECB is considering tapering has led to some buying in the euro, especially against the yen,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. ""We do not think the ECB is anywhere close to tapering its asset purchase program, but in the near term momentum is toward euro upside.""
The single currency had been kept relatively subdued against the dollar in the past few months as the ECB has been easing extensively while the Federal Reserve is poised to raise rates in coming months.
""It remains to be seen if the report can be substantiated. But the mood in the market appears to have shifted with the mention of ECB tapering as it would spell an end to monetary policy divergence,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
DOLLAR SLIPS
The euro's rise saw the dollar retreat from near a two-month high against a basket of currencies. The greenback had been on a strong footing after rallying at the start of the week on an upbeat survey of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
It got an additional lift after Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker said on Tuesday there was a strong case for raising interest rates and as Treasury yields rose to two-week highs in response to a surge by their euro zone counterparts.
The dollar index was down 0.15 percent at 96.038, having risen to 96.442 on Tuesday, its highest since Aug. 9. It was slightly lower at 102.77 yen after rising to a three-week high of 102.965 on Tuesday, when it posted its sixth straight day of gains versus its Japanese peer.

Meanwhile, the sterling fell below $1.27 for the first time in over three decades amid worries that Britain's separation from the European Union could be rocky and have adverse economic consequences.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen and euro on Tuesday, boosted by an upbeat U.S. manufacturing sector survey, while the pound wallowed near a three-decade low on concerns over a potential ""hard Brexit"" for Britain.
The dollar added to overnight gains and was up 0.5 percent at 102.170 yen  after touching a 13-day high of 102.395. The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.1201  after slipping 0.3 percent the previous day.
The greenback was on the front foot after an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey showed the U.S. manufacturing sector returned to expansion in September. 
The dollar also firmed against the yen because of a reduction in risk aversion, as concerns over  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) have eased for now.
""There might be follow-through buying for the dollar, but it could be difficult for the currency to break out of recent range as the ISM data alone won't boost the case for the Fed to continuously hike rates,"" said Shin Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
Fed funds futures imply that investors still see a very low chance of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its next policy meeting in November. The odds slightly favor an increase in December. But before then the currency market will have to navigate the U.S. presidential election.
The dollar index (DXY) rose 0.2 percent to 95.893.
The U.S. currency was particularly strong against the pound, which has declined steadily since British Prime Minister Theresa May set a March deadline to begin the UK's formal departure process from the European Union.
The March deadline offers some clarity to the process and underpinned stocks, but many in the market worry that the government's stance points to a ""hard Brexit"" where Britain quits the single market in favor of retaining control over migration. [GBP/]
Sterling was down 0.1 percent at $1.2829  after falling on Monday to $1.2818, nearing the 31-year low of $1.2798 plumbed on July 6 in the market turmoil following the late-June Brexit referendum.
While the post-referendum turmoil spurred demand for safe-havens like the yen, analysts pointed out that the latest slide in the pound is yet to trigger similar reaction. 
""Right now the reaction to Prime Minister May setting a departure deadline is mostly limited to the pound. A greater negative impact on the British economy will have be witnessed first for Brexit woes to cause broader risk aversion,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
The Australian dollar showed little reaction to the Reserve Bank of Australia's widely-expected policy decision to stand pat on monetary policy.
The RBA kept its cash rate at a record low of 1.5 percent as Australia's biggest-ever boom in apartment-building has helped support economic activity.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2016 03:01PM ET</span>","Sterling drops near 31-year low, dollar firms on U.S. data","By Richard Leong
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sterling fell on Monday near a 31-year low against the dollar and to a three-year low versus the euro after a March deadline was set for the start of the formal process that will split Britain from the European Union. 
The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies on a private report that showed the U.S. manufacturing sector returned to expansion territory in September.
Among emerging markets, the Colombia peso tumbled as much as 3 percent against the greenback after voters on Sunday rejected a peace deal with Marxist FARC rebels, raising worries about the nation's credit ratings and ability to embark on tax reforms.
In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May told her Conservative party's annual conference that she was determined to move on with Brexit and win the ""right deal"" in an effort to ease fears inside her party that she may delay the split with the EU.
""That caught the market by surprise with some people still hoping Brexit won't happen,"" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York.
May's Brexit comments came after the pound posted its worst run of quarterly losses since 1984.
The pound had dropped more than 1 percent against the dollar to as low as $1.2818  before trimming losses in late U.S. trading. It was briefly less than half a cent away from the 31-year low it reached in early July, shortly after the June 23 vote to leave the EU. It was last down 0.9 percent at $1.2863.
Sterling also shed 0.7 percent against the euro at 87.18 pence after it hit 87.48 pence (EURGBP=D4), its weakest since August 2013.
DOLLAR BOUNCES
The greenback enjoyed a modest rise in light trading as some European and Asian markets were closed for holidays.
The dollar index was up 0.25 percent at 95.701 after the Institute for Supply Management said its barometer on U.S. factory activity rose to 51.5 in September, above the 49.4 in August and beating forecasts among economists polled by Reuters.
A reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing sector is growing.
While the overall ISM reading on factory activity was encouraging, it was not enough to raise expectations the U.S. economy is picking up steam.
""It's not runaway support for the dollar,"" TD's Issa said.
Meanwhile, the Colombian peso tumbled to its weakest level against the dollar in two weeks after Sunday's referendum rejected a peace deal between the government and FARC guerrillas.
Any renegotiated agreement now seems to depend on whether the FARC could accept some tougher sanctions against them.
The Colombian peso was last down 1.7 percent at 2,931 to the dollar  as Sunday's surprise vote stoked worries about a lowering of the country's credit rating.
“I think the market will have to price in that higher probability of a downgrade, so I think there is some downside risk in the very short term to Colombian assets,” said Jim Barrineau, Co-head Emerging Market Debt at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) in New York.

809,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 02, 2016 04:38AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly outlook: October 3 - 7,"Investing.com - The dollar retreated from one-and-a-half week highs against the euro on Friday and gained ground against the safe haven yen and the Swiss franc as concerns over the health of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) eased.
EUR/USD was up 0.19% at 1.1240 in late trade, after falling as low as 1.1153 earlier, the weakest level since September 21.
The single currency was boosted as Deutsche Bank shares rebounded following reports that it is nearing a deal to settle a mortgage-securities investigation by paying a $5.4 billion fine, well below the Justice Department’s original proposal of $14 billion.
Reduced concerns over the health of the German banking giant helped push the dollar to one-and-a-half week highs against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF hitting session highs of 0.9752.
The dollar also gained ground against the yen with USD/JPY last up 0.31% at 101.33, after hitting a session high of 101.78.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last little changed at 95.38.
In the week ahead, traders will be focusing their attention on Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report, seen by many as the clearest sign on the health of the labor market, amid ongoing speculation over whether U.S. interest rates will rise this year.
The Fed raised rates for the first time in almost a decade in December and forecast rates would rise four times this year, but officials have recently acknowledged that the mixed economic recovery means rates are likely to remain lower for longer.
The Fed’s next meeting is in November, but a rate hike ahead of the presidential election is seen as unlikely.
Expectations for lower rates typically weigh on the dollar by making it less attractive to yield seeking investors.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of this and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2016 11:10PM ET</span>",China's yuan joins elite club of IMF reserve currencies,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's yuan joins the International Monetary Fund's basket of reserve currencies on Saturday in a milestone for the government's campaign for recognition as a global economic power. 
The yuan joins the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen and British pound in the IMF's special drawing rights (SDR) basket, which determines currencies that countries can receive as part of IMF loans. It marks the first time a new currency has been added since the euro was launched in 1999.The IMF is adding the yuan, also known as the renminbi, or ""people's money"", on the same day that the Communist Party celebrates the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
""The inclusion into the SDR is a milestone in the internationalization of the renminbi, and is an affirmation of the success of China's economic development and results of the reform and opening up of the financial sector,"" the People's Bank of China said in a statement.
China will use this opportunity to further deepen economic reforms and open up the sector to promote global growth, the central bank added.
The IMF announced last year that it would add the yuan to the basket, so actual inclusion is not expected to impact financial markets. But it puts Beijing's often opaque economic and foreign exchange policy in the international spotlight as some central banks add yuan assets to their official reserves. 
Critics argue that the move is largely symbolic and the yuan does not fully meet IMF reserve currency criteria of being freely usable, or widely used to settle trade or widely traded in financial markets. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said he will formally label China a currency manipulator if he wins November's election. 
China stunned investors by devaluing the currency last year and the yuan has since weakened to near six-year lows, adding to worries about already feeble global growth. 
Some China watchers also fear that Beijing's commitment to further market opening and financial sector reforms will fade after its diplomatic success, despite repeated reassurances from Beijing it will continue with the process. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Thursday the yuan was ""quite a ways"" from true global reserve currency status. The new IMF status recognizes the ""enormous"" change in China in the last 10 years that had made the yuan more open, but Beijing still had work to do to make its currency and its economy more market-driven, he said. ""Being part of the SDR basket at the IMF is quite a ways away from being a global reserve currency,"" he said. 
Capital Economics said inclusion of the currency in the IMF's SDR basket will have minimal impact on foreign demand for yuan assets, so ""offers little support"" for the currency. 
""If anything, the risk is that official intervention to keep the renminbi stable ahead of its inclusion will subsequently be paired back, allowing for renewed deprecation,"" it said in a research note.

The IMF on Friday fixed the relative amounts of the five currencies in the basket for five years, based on their average exchange rates over the past three months.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2016 03:48AM ET</span>",Euro hits two-month low vs Swiss franc on Deutsche Bank jitters,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro dropped to a two-month low against the safe-haven Swiss franc and lost ground broadly on Friday, as concerns about the health of  Deutsche Bank  weighed on the single currency and undermined risk appetite across global markets.
The Swiss franc was also bolstered by expectations that Middle Eastern investment houses could pull out money from the United States and into alternative safe-haven liquid currencies like the franc.
Those expectations were raised after the U.S. Congress voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government.
""Risk appetite seems to be backtracking as European banking concerns mount,"" said Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), adding that Swiss franc strength was not just a reflection of the European banking problems.
""It could also be seen in the context of Middle Eastern accounts possibly starting to pull out of the U.S.,"" he said.
The Swiss franc hit an eight-week high against the euro at 1.08125 franc (EURCHF=) in the London session. The euro  fell 0.4 percent to $1.11775 , while it lost 0.6 percent against the yen to trade at 112.77 yen (EURJPY=). 
The yen, also seen as a safe-haven currency, has rebounded from Thursday's trough versus the dollar as global share prices slipped on worries about Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), under pressure from a massive fine imposed by the United States over its sales of mortgage-backed securities.
The latest lurch came after Bloomberg reported that a number of hedge funds that clear derivatives trades with Deutsche had withdrawn some excess cash held at the lender, which has dropped to fourth in overall rankings as a currency trader.
YEN FIRMER
The Japanese yen looked set for its third straight quarter of gains. It has gained about 2 percent so far this quarter, on course to log its third consecutive quarter of gains, as investors suspect the Bank of Japan has reached a practical limit in stimulus and has lost clout in cheapening the yen. 
Earlier, the dollar rose from around 101.15 yen to 101.80 yen in just a few minutes, a move traders said appeared to be linked to month-end or quarter-end flows.
The dollar later pared some of its gains and was last trading at 100.80 yen , down 0.2 percent on the day.
Focus will be on U.S. data and a better-than-expected personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator -- the Federal Reserve's favourite inflation gauge -- could offer support to the dollar. 
""The Fed seems more focused on employment than on inflation,"" said Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at FXPrimus. 

""Nonetheless it could help to persuade the holdouts on the Fed that a rate hike in December -- currently seen as only a 58 percent probability -- is justified and therefore be dollar-positive.""

820,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 29, 2016 09:52PM ET</span>",Forex - Yen retraces weakness after Caixin PMI in busy Asian data day,"Investing.com - The yen retraced earlier weakness in Asia on Friday as the Caixin manufacturing PMI for China came in as expected, offsetting mixed Japanese data on consumer prices, household spending and industrial production and jobs.
USD/JPY changed hands at 101.10, up 0.07%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7631, down 0.05%, off earlier weaker levels as the Australian currency's fortunes are closely tied to key trade partner China.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI for September came in at 50.1 as expected with holidays in China next week in focus going forward. ""The readings for the manufacturing PMI over the past three months seem to indicate that the economy has begun to stabilise,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at Caixin said.
But Zhong cautioned that an increasingly strained fiscal budget could pose a risk to sustainable growth. ""Given that the growth rate of fiscal income has slowed recently while expenditures have swung, there is insufficient momentum to drive future economic growth, and there is a risk that industrial output may decline.""
The official China manufacturing PMI for September from the National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing will be released on Saturday and came in at 50.4 in August which was the highest since October 2014.
In Australia, HIA new home sales for September rose 6.1% month-on-month, with a fall of 9.7% the previous month and housing credit gained 0.5% for August, the same as the previous month, while private sector credit gained 0.4%, below the 0.5% gain seen in August month-on-month.
Earlier in Japan, a busy day with household spending for August down a sharp 3.7%, compared to a drop of 1.0% seen month-on-month and a decline of 4.6% year-on-year, more than the 2.5% fall seen. It was the 11th fall in the past 12 months. As Thursday's retail sales data showed, spending slowed in August, when typhoon weather kept shoppers away and there was one less weekend compared to a year before. As well, the seasonally adjusted average unemployment rate in August edged up from the previous month to 3.1% but was still close to a 21-year low of 3.0% in July.
As well, national core CPI for August fell 0.5%, more than the expected 0.4% decline year-on-year, the sixth straight drop, matching July's pace. Retailers are cautious about raising prices in broad sectors after last year's price hikes amidst the uncertainty over global and domestic growth. And national CPI dipped 0.5% for August as expected.
Industrial production in Japan for August rose 1.5% provisionally, handily beating an expected gain of 0.5%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.05% to 95.48.
Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, Fed Governor Jerome Powell, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Kansas City Fed President Esther George are all scheduled to speak during the day.There is also an appearance by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who is due to speak via video conference at the Minority Bankers Forum in Kansas City at 4:00PM ET (20:00GMT).
Yellen told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank does not have a ""fixed timetable"" for modifying its monetary policy. However, she added that continued job creation at its current pace would cause the economy to overheat and, in that case, the Fed could be forced to raise rates faster than expected. Markets are currently pricing in around a 52% chance of a rate hike at December's meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Overnight, the dollar trimmed gains against the other major currencies on Thursday, after the release of weak U.S. pending home sales data dampened optimism sparked by strong U.S. economic reports released earlier in the day.
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index fell 2.4% last month, missing expectations for an increase of 0.3%. The index reading at 108.5 is the second lowest this year after January’s 105.4.
Official data earlier showed that the third estimate of U.S. second quarter gross domestic product showed growth of 1.4%, revised from the previous reading of a 1.1% expansion. Analysts had expected a growth rate of 1.3%.

USD/JPY changed hands at 101.22, up 0.19%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7621, down 0.18%.
Ahead in Australia, HIA new home sales for September are due month-on-month, with a fall of 9.7% the previous month and housing credit is slated for August after a 0.5% gain the previous month as well as private sector credit seen up 0.5% in August month-on-month.
Then comes the Caixin manufacturing PMI for September ahead of holidays in China next week with a 50.1 level expected, nudging up from 50.0 the previous month.
Earlier in Japan, a busy day with household spending for August down a sharp 3.7%, compared to a drop of 1.0% seen month-on-month and a decline of 4.6% year-on-year, more than the 2.5% fall seen. It was the 11th fall in the past 12 months. As Thursday's retail sales data showed, spending slowed in August, when typhoon weather kept shoppers away and there was one less weekend compared to a year before. As well, the seasonally adjusted average unemployment rate in August edged up from the previous month to 3.1% but was still close to a 21-year low of 3.0% in July.
As well, national core CPI for August fell 0.5%, more than the expected 0.4% decline year-on-year, the sixth straight drop, matching July's pace. Retailers are cautious about raising prices in broad sectors after last year's price hikes amidst the uncertainty over global and domestic growth. And national CPI dipped 0.5% for August as expected.
Industrial production in Japan for August rose 1.5% provisionally, handily beating an expected gain of 0.5%.

Yellen told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank does not have a ""fixed timetable"" for modifying its monetary policy. However, she added that continued job creation at its current pace would cause the economy to overheat and, in that case, the Fed could be forced to raise rates faster than expected.
Markets are currently pricing in around a 52% chance of a rate hike at December's meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2016 08:17AM ET</span>","Dollar surges vs yen after OPEC deal, though questions linger","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit an eight-day high against the safe-haven yen on Thursday after an OPEC deal to cut oil output spurred a move into riskier assets, though questions over the efficacy of the agreement left the greenback off its earlier highs.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would reduce output to a range of 32.5 million-33.0 million barrels per day, a reduction of 0.7-2.2 percent, and the first such deal since 2008.
The currencies of oil-exporting countries such as Canada  and Norway (EURNOK=D3) surged after the deal late on Wednesday, but were slightly down on Thursday, mirroring a dip in oil prices, as markets grew more skeptical on how OPEC would implement the planned output cut. 
Both currencies were still, however, trading more than 1 percent higher than their levels before the oil deal was announced by 1150 GMT. The Norwegian crown had been a clear winner, hitting a 14-month high of 9.00 per euro (EURNOK=R), but fell about 0.3 percent on Thursday. 
""Clearly it's not insignificant that it's the first OPEC agreement of any sort for eight years, but I think there still are many question marks over how deliverable the output reduction will be,"" said RBC Capital Markets currency strategist Adam Cole. 
""The market has taken the rally in crude prices as a risk-on driver... and I'm not sure how durable that is when the recovery in crude prices is being driven by supply rather than demand.""
Some analysts cautioned that the oil-cut deal is leaving crucial details on how much each country will produce to be decided at the next formal OPEC meeting in November, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia.
The dollar had jumped as much as 1.1 percent to 101.75 yen , its strongest since Sept. 21, but fell back to around 101.49 yen, still up 0.8 percent on the day. 
Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was slightly up on the day at 95.46 (DXY). 
""The environment for the dollar is still broadly supportive – the Fed is still the only central bank that looks set to raise interest rates,"" said BMO Capital Markets currency strategist Stephen Gallo, in London. 
""At a time like this you tiptoe back into yield, you tiptoe back into carry,"" he added, referring to the practice of borrowing a low-yielding, low-risk currency and selling it to buy a riskier one with a higher return. 
The Australian dollar  also hit a three-week high of $0.7711 - the country exports various natural resources even though it is a net importer of oil - but was down 0.3 percent by 1150 GMT.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2016 04:00PM ET</span>",U.S. dollar slips against commodity currencies after OPEC deal,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit a roughly five-month low against the Norwegian crown and fell against other commodity-linked currencies on Wednesday after OPEC sources told Reuters the producing group agreed to reduce its oil output.
The agreement on Wednesday marked the first time the group cut its oil output since 2008. Two sources in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the group would reduce output to 32.5 million barrels per day from current production of 33.24 million bpd.
Currencies of countries that rely heavily on energy or raw material exports, such as the Norwegian crown and the Canadian and Australian dollars, gained against the greenback after the report. The gains tracked a rally in oil prices, which settled more than 5 percent higher. [O/R]
The dollar fell nearly 1 percent against the crown to a roughly five-month low of 8.0403 crowns  after the report. The greenback also sank to a five-day low against the Canadian dollar of C$1.3088 , about 0.8 percent lower on the day. 
""The price action suggests it was a bit of a surprise,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, in reference to commodity currencies' gains after the Reuters report. 
""The next step to whether this has staying power is to see what kind of implementation there is,"" he said. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last roughly flat at 95.451. Besides the moves in commodity currencies, traders awaited more U.S. economic data for clues on the likelihood of a December Federal Reserve rate increase. 
The euro was last roughly flat against the dollar at $1.1212, with uncertainty about the state of European banks preventing investors from bidding the currency higher after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares touched record lows Tuesday.. 
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest lender, is fighting a $14 billion U.S. demand to settle claims it missold mortgage-backed securities.
""People are waiting for more U.S. data, but they’re also on tenterhooks regarding the European banks,"" said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. ""It’s causing the euro to trade sideways until there is greater clarity.""

The dollar was last up 0.24 percent against the yen at 100.67 yen <JPY=>, and was roughly flat against the Swiss franc  at 0.9710 franc.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Mexican peso rose 2 percent on Tuesday, recovering from record lows against the U.S. dollar, buoyed by a view that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton did better than rival Donald Trump in a television debate.
The peso  was on track for its best daily performance since February, lifting the higher-yielding Canadian dollar  along with it. Canada, like Mexico, has close trade ties with the U.S. and is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Markets have tended to see Clinton as the someone who is likely to retain status quo, while few are sure what a Trump presidency might mean for U.S. foreign policy, international trade deals or the domestic economy.
Opinion polls have shown the two candidates in a tight race, with the latest Reuters/Ipsos polling showing Clinton ahead by 4 percentage points, with 41 percent of likely voters.
As early risk aversion faded across markets, higher-yielding currencies like the Australian  and New Zealand dollars  also did well, rising 0.4 percent against the U.S. dollar. The safe-haven yen  underperformed, falling 0.4 percent against the U.S. dollar,
""The market is dominated by risk-on. Not only the currencies of the neighboring countries Mexico and Canada were able to appreciate notably, but also other conventional risk currencies such as Aussie, kiwi and the Scandinavian currencies,"" said Esther Reichelt, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""Similar to the June 23 Brexit referendum date, Nov. 8 (the Presidential election date) entails some very binary risks. Either everything remains as it is which a Clinton victory would imply or there is a likelihood of everything or at least a lot changing rapidly.""
Earlier, the Mexican peso hit record lows of around 19.92 pesos per dollar on concerns that a Trump victory would threaten Mexico's exports to the United States, its single biggest market. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday showed that speculators had recently ramped up their bearish bets against the peso.
It was last trading at 19.5150, up around 2 percent on the day. Similarly the U.S. dollar was down 0.44 percent against its Canadian counterpart at C$1.3171 , having hit a six-month high earlier in the Asian trading session.
The Democrat and Republican candidates traded barbs and accusations in their first debate. 

""It may be that Clinton did a little bit better than was the initial expectation, or you could say that Trump didn't surprise in any way. Maybe the market was afraid that he was going to have something up his sleeve to surprise and make him look good,"" said Jasper Bargmann, head of trading at Nordea Bank in Singapore.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the safe-haven yen on Monday after comments from a top Bank of Japan (BOJ) official reinforced views that the central bank was unable to weaken the yen, while an impending U.S. presidential debate stoked uncertainty. 
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Monday the central bank stood ready to use every possible policy tool to achieve its 2 percent inflation target. He also said no big increase or decrease to its bond buying was expected for now.
The comments eased speculation that the BOJ was considering tapering asset purchases and supported a view that the BOJ was keeping in place a monetary policy that has only led the yen to strengthen. 
The yen has gained more than 17 percent since the BOJ shocked markets in January by cutting rates below zero for the first time. The dollar was last down 0.5 percent against the yen  at 100.47 yen after touching a session low of 100.34 yen. 
""The BOJ is saying we’ll continue on the current path,"" said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. ""That means the yen at current levels will continue to strengthen.""
The yen also gained ahead of a U.S. presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump at 9 p.m. ET (0100 GMT on Tuesday), as well as Moody's move to cut Turkey's sovereign rating to ""junk"" on Friday and an uncertain outcome to an OPEC meeting. 
Analysts said uncertainty over the impact of the U.S. presidential debate hurt the dollar since the nervousness was specific to the United States. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.21 percent at 95.272.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar index was a tad lower on Friday, and on track for its worst week for a month after the Federal Reserve trimmed its long-term rate expectations and the Bank of Japan retooled its monetary policy framework.
In Europe, data showed eurozone business activity expanding in September at its weakest pace since the start of 2015. But it was little surprise and had limited impact on policy expectations and the single currency.
The dollar index was subdued at 95.397 (DXY), while the euro was up 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.1215 . The U.S. currency was flat at 100.70 yen , not far from a nearly four-week low of 100.10 struck on Thursday and on course to shed more than 1 percent for the week.
""The Fed lowering its medium-term rate guidance path while keeping a rate hike in play at the end of this year has left the dollar very finely balanced,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura.
The Federal Reserve projected a less aggressive rise in rates next year and in 2018, and cut its longer-run interest rate forecast to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent. 
Traders said the focus was moving to the first televised U.S. presidential debate early next week. Markets are mostly expecting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the presidency and have not factored in the implications of a victory for Donald Trump.
""Indeed, we believe that the markets are rather complacent about the outcome of the elections and expect growing uncertainty ahead of the 8 November vote to add to the dollar headwinds,""  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) analysts said in a note.
YEN FIRMER
The yen was on track to finish higher on the week against the dollar and the euro. This was after the BOJ shifted to targeting interest rates on Japanese government bonds as the focus of its massive monetary easing program, dropping its explicit target of increasing base money.
The BOJ's announcement initially sent the dollar up more than 1 percent to 102.79 yen, though the gains unraveled as investors realized that the central bank would still have an uphill task to push inflation towards its 2 percent target.
The dollar's proximity to the 100-yen level did not escape the attention of Japanese authorities, who do not want the yen to rise sharply.

""We're concerned about recent extremely nervous moves in the currency market,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference on Friday.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2016 03:24PM ET</span>",Dollar falls broadly after Fed cuts longer-term rate view,"By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest level in 10 days against a basket of major currencies on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve cut its longer-term interest rate expectations.
The U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee left its target rate for overnight lending unchanged at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday. It also projected a less aggressive rise in rates next year and in 2018, and cut its longer-run interest rate forecast to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent.
That knocked the dollar almost across the board as investors reduced their expectations for U.S. interest rates. 
""On one hand the Fed looks like it will raise rates in December ... and on the surface that's somewhat hawkish and positive for the dollar, but at the same time the Fed lowered its longer-term projected path of interest rates,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
""It's hard to get too excited about the dollar when the Fed is lowering its projected path of rate hikes into the future.""
Higher interest rates make currencies more attractive to investors.
The dollar index (DXY) fell to 95.048, its lowest point since Sept. 12. It rebounded slightly in afternoon trading, gaining largely against the euro and was last down 0.25 percent at 95.426.
Earlier, the euro  touched its highest level against the dollar in nearly a week at $1.1250. It was last up 0.15 percent at $1.1202. 
The dollar hit a two-week low against the Swiss franc , falling to 0.9663 franc. 
Oil prices rose for the second straight day thanks in part to a surprisingly large drop in U.S. crude inventories, pushing oil-linked currencies like the Canadian dollar , Colombian peso  and Russian rouble  higher.
Those currencies also benefited from risk-on sentiment bolstered by the Fed's apparent lower interest rate path, analysts said.
The dollar hit its lowest level against the loonie and peso in nearly two weeks and its lowest level against the rouble since Aug. 18.
The major gainer against the dollar was the Norwegian crown , which rose more than 2 percent after Norway's central bank left its main interest rate unchanged and suggested further rate cuts may not be needed because of a pickup in the economy. 

That move came despite reports on Wednesday that the country's unemployment rate rose to its highest level in 20 years.

888,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2016 04:36AM ET</span>",Yen recovers amid scepticism about BOJ's latest policy tweak,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen recovered from lows on Wednesday, with investors skeptical about whether the Bank of Japan latest measures will be enough to generate inflation, with many also cautious about the dollar before the Federal Reserve's policy announcement.
Japan's central bank, overhauling its massive stimulus program, decided to scrap its focus on monetary base and set targets for long-term rates. It also committed to an overshoot of its elusive 2 percent inflation target.
The BOJ maintained the 0.1 percent negative interest rate it applies to some of the excess reserves that financial institutions park with the central bank. 
But it abandoned its base money target and instead set a ""yield curve control,"" under which it will buy long-term government bonds to keep 10-year bond yields around current levels of zero percent.
The BOJ's measures gave a boost to global risk sentiment and banking stocks and added to downward pressure on the safe-haven yen, which tends to do well during times when financial markets comes under stress.
But the yen bounced back to trade broadly steady against the dollar and the euro in the European session.
""The announcements likely won't eradicate the scepticism in the market over the BOJ's ability to achieve its inflation goal through additional easing,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of market research at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi.
""The strengthening of the inflation goal by now seeking an overshoot is all well and good, but if there is deep doubt over reaching even 2 percent, there will be even greater doubt over achieving an overshoot. So there is nothing in today's announcement to make us turn suddenly yen bearish.
The dollar, which rose more than 1 percent to a one-week high of 102.79 yen , fell to trade at 101.75 yen, broadly unchanged on the day. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's upbeat comments on the Japanese economy also helped the yen.
The euro, which had surged to 114.36 yen (EURJPY=), was trading at 113.50 yen, only slightly higher on the day. Traders said the fact that BOJ took action to boost inflation was a surprise to many who had doubts that the central bank had much left in its arsenal.
""Many people expected the BOJ not to take any action at all, and the yen to strengthen, so we now see many people buying the dollar back,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo.
Investors' attention will now shift to the Fed. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates unchanged at 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent, and could hint at a rate hike by the end of the year.
Weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data has prompted investors to call off bets for a Fed rate hike on Wednesday. 

On Tuesday, data showed U.S. housing starts fell more than expected in August as building activity declined broadly after two straight months of solid increases.

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen edged up against the dollar on Tuesday, as traders doubted that the Bank of Japan will be able to meaningfully weaken the yen when it meets on Wednesday, and betted that the U.S. Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates.
The yen rose 0.3 percent against a broadly weaker greenback to 101.645 yen , having risen almost 20 percent over the past 12 months despite the BOJ's best efforts to weaken it.
The dollar dipped 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies (DXY). 
From Frankfurt, Esther Reichelt said she expected a quiet day, though thin trading volumes could lead to some exaggerated moves not driven by fundamental factors. 
""Everybody is just waiting for the BOJ and the Fed – why do anything today?"" she said. ""Everyone has already positioned for these events and there is no new information that could give them a reason to reposition, so I expect a rather calm day."" 
BOJ officials have suggested in recent weeks that there is room to cut interest rates further, having taken them into negative territory for the first time earlier this year despite criticism that they are hurting financial institutions and even damaging economic sentiment.
The central bank has acknowledged the potential costs of unorthodox policy, prompting speculation that it will probably seek to steepen the yield curve to mitigate the impact of negative rates on financial institutions.
Yet currency market players are not so sure such a step would help to reverse the yen's rally, amid a growing sense that the BOJ may be running out of ammunition.
""It will be difficult for the BOJ to come up with a measure that will significantly push down the yen,"" said Koji Fukaya, CEO of FPG Securities in Tokyo. 
Dealers note that selling dollar/yen after the BOJ's policy meetings has been a winning strategy this year - the yen gained sharply following the BOJ's last three meetings.
Dollar/yen options pricing suggests the market thinks the risk of the dollar falling below 100 yen is relatively small.
The overwhelming consensus ahead of the result of the Fed's meeting, which will follow the BOJ's, is that it will hold rates steady this week - only a 12 percent chance of a hike is priced in, according to CME FedWatch. 
But some market players expect the Fed to drop a clear hint that it will raise rates this year.
That should support the dollar broadly at a time when most other central banks in the world remain in an easing cycle.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2016 04:40PM ET</span>","Shore up the euro before it's too late, experts warn","By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Will the euro survive the next big crisis?
A new report inspired by Jacques Delors, one of the architects of the single currency, says it probably won't and urges policymakers to pursue immediate changes to Europe's troubled monetary union to ward off the inevitable collapse.
The report, entitled ""Repair and Prepare - Growth and the Euro after Brexit"", comes at a time when even the most ardent defenders of the euro are cautioning against closer integration in the aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
Pressing ahead, they worry, would deepen public resentment towards Europe after years of economic crisis that has pushed up unemployment and sent populist, eurosceptic parties surging in opinion polls.
The authors, a group of academics, think tankers and former policymakers from across Europe, acknowledge the obstacles but argue that politicians cannot afford to wait. They have put together a three-pronged plan for shoring up the euro that they believe is politically feasible despite the troubling backdrop.
""Reforming the euro might not be popular. But it is essential and urgent: at some point in the future, Europe will be hit by a new economic crisis,"" the report says.
""We do not know whether this will be in six weeks, six months or six years. But in its current set-up the euro is unlikely to survive that coming crisis.""
In the works since before the Brexit vote in June, the 38-page report was put together by Berlin-based political economy professor Henrik Enderlein and former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta, both of the Delors Institute, together with the Bertelsmann Foundation.
They worked with former central bankers Joerg Asmussen and Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, the former economics adviser to French President Francois Hollande, Laurence Boone, as well as ex-WTO chief Pascal Lamy and Philippe Maystadt, the former finance minister of Belgium.
In a first stage to shore up the single currency, they recommend ""quick fixes"" that include a reinforcement of the euro zone's rescue mechanism, the ESM, a strengthening of banking union and improved economic policy coordination that does not require changes to the EU treaty.
This would be followed by a north-south quid pro quo on structural reforms and investments. In a third stage, the euro zone would move to a more federal structure, with risk and sovereignty sharing. This final stage, the most controversial, could take a decade or more to realize and is described as important but optional.
Central to the argument is the view that the European Central Bank has used up virtually all of its ammunition in the past year and that it is now urgent for politicians to act.
""The ECB is in a Catch-22 situation,"" said Enderlein. ""If it says that it's out of ammunition, it is weakening its own position. But if it says everything is fine, then governments won't do their part.""

""Everyone is focused on the latest crises, from refugees to Brexit,"" added Asmussen. ""We want to remind everyone that the monetary union is still incomplete.""

907,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2016 10:44AM ET</span>","Dollar slips ahead of BOJ, Fed meetings","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell from Friday's more than two-week high against a basket of major currencies on Monday on expectations that any Bank of Japan action this week would not weaken the yen and the Federal Reserve would refrain from raising rates. 
The BOJ is due to conduct a comprehensive review of its policy framework, which combines negative interest rates with a massive asset-buying program. The BOJ and Fed meet on Sept. 20-21. 
Speculation is rife that the BOJ will change tack in favor of a policy mix that ups stimulus while also protecting banks from the problems generated by negative interest rates on deposits.
A growing belief that the BOJ will stop short of the dramatic action needed to weaken its currency, however, sent the dollar to a six-day low against the yen of 101.59 yen . The dollar was last down 0.61 percent against the yen at 101.66 yen. 
""There is a certain amount of skepticism going into this meeting that the BOJ has run out of tools,"" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corporation in New York.
Doubts that the BOJ is capable of weakening the yen have grown since the BOJ shocked markets in January by cutting rates below zero for the first time, which only weakened the currency temporarily. The yen has since gained more than 16 percent against the dollar. 
Expectations that the Fed would not raise interest rates this week also weakened the dollar. Traders saw just a 15 percent chance of a rate hike this Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
While that probability was up slightly from 12 percent on Friday, expectations are far higher for a rate hike in December, at more than 56 percent. 
""The market is resigned to believe that (the Fed is) not going to raise rates this week,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Ltd in New York.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.38 percent at 95.744 (DXY) after hitting a 15-day high of 96.108 on Friday. The euro was last up 0.24 percent against the dollar at $1.1180. 
Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars rallied on gains in oil prices. The Aussie was last up about 1 percent against the dollar at a six-day high of $0.7568.

SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar eased versus the yen on Friday, struggling to gain traction after lackluster U.S. economic data further dampened already low expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike next week. 
Movements in major currencies were confined to relatively narrow ranges with a wait-and-see mood prevailing ahead of the Sept. 20-21 Fed and Bank of Japan policy meetings.
The dollar eased 0.1 percent to 102.02 yen . The greenback is down 0.7 percent for the week, with the yen finding favor as risk sentiment soured on worries that central banks are running out of ammunition to bolster economic growth.
Data issued on Thursday showed U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in August amid weak purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods. 
Financial markets are pricing in a roughly 12 percent probability of a Fed rate hike next week, down from 15 percent before the data, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
""While the dollar/yen will keep an eye on Japanese government bond yields and equities, it is likely to be range bound around 102 yen before the BOJ policy meeting,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""But there is the risk of the market reacting to speculative reports on the Fed and BOJ during the media blackout period before the policy meetings.""
At its meeting next week, the BOJ is due to conduct a comprehensive review of its current policy framework that combines negative interest rates with a massive asset-buying program.
Many market players expect the BOJ to indicate a preference for a steeper yield curve to cushion the blow on banks from negative interest rates. There is also focus on whether the central bank will cut interest rates deeper into negative.
There still seem to be some expectations that the BOJ could cut interest rates deeper into negative territory, said Sim Moh Siong, FX strategist for Bank of Singapore, adding that the yen is likely to rise if the BOJ were to stand pat. 
""I think the market has somewhat priced in a (rate) cut as well as a tweak to the QE program,"" Sim said. 
""If the BOJ stays put next week then I would expect the yen to come under some appreciation pressure, especially if the Fed stays put as well,"" he added. 
The euro  was little changed at $1.1240. 
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar inched up 0.1 percent to $0.7520  after posting a 0.7 percent gain on Thursday.

The Aussie, sensitive to shifts in broader risk sentiment, hit a seven-week low of $0.7443 earlier this week. But the commodity-linked currency has pulled up from that trough thanks to sizeable gains in prices of commodities such as copper and crude oil following a rough patch earlier this week.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2016 05:52AM ET</span>","Rupee hit by devaluation talk, despite ministry denial","By Suvashree Choudhury and Douglas Busvine
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's finance ministry swatted down a media report on Thursday of a possible devaluation of the rupee, dismissing lobbying by struggling exporters seeking a competitive boost from a cheaper currency.
The rupee  weakened 0.28 percent to 67.0750 to the dollar after a television channel CNBC-TV18 reported that the commerce ministry would propose a devaluation, before steadying after the central bank stepped in to prevent a sharp fall.
At 0900 GMT (04:00 a.m. EDT), it traded off the day's lows at 67.00, weaker than Wednesday's close of 66.8875/8975.
""The value of rupee is determined by the market and there is no plan to change policy,"" the finance ministry's economic affairs secretary, Shaktikanta Das, told reporters. ""Reports that the government wants to devalue the rupee are false.""
A policymaker stressed that the Reserve Bank of India did not set the rupee's exchange rate and is ""there only to contain volatility. 
""It will always allow the market to decide the rupee's right price,"" this person said. ""The RBI doesn't believe in devaluing the currency. It also doesn't make sense because our imports are more than our exports.""
LOBBYING BY EXPORTERS
In July, India's merchandise exports fell 6.8 percent from a year earlier, according to government data showing weak global demand. Imports fell faster, by 19 percent, on low oil prices. India ran a $7.8 billion monthly trade deficit.
The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), a business group, confirmed it had discussed the rupee's exchange rate and interest rates with the commerce ministry.
""A rupee devaluation is required,"" its director-general Ajai Sahai said. ""Indian exporters are outpriced in the global market."" 
One commerce ministry official said the department favored the demands of exporters and might raise the matter with the finance ministry before taking it to the cabinet. However, a senior finance ministry official said no proposal had been made to devalue the rupee.
Lobbying of ""nodal"" ministries such as commerce is common in New Delhi but the finance ministry, which under Arun Jaitley is the most powerful department outside Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, often gives it short shrift.
India's commerce ministry is responsible for trade policy but not for exchange rate policy, which is the domain of the RBI. The central bank does, however, consult with the finance ministry on exchange rates.
MINISTER'S TWEET
After Thursday's TV report, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted that she had not told a reporter the government was discussing a devaluation. But her comments stopped short of denying the ministry was weighing such a proposal.
Sitharaman, who does not hold cabinet rank, recently called on the RBI to cut interest rates by two percentage points.
Those remarks came at a sensitive time, as the RBI has a new chief, Urjit Patel, and a six-member Monetary Policy Committee being created to set interest rates has yet to be fully staffed up.
Three of the MPC's members would be ""external"" candidates. A replacement for Patel as deputy governor has still to be chosen, and it is conceivable that he could find himself heading a panel with dovish leanings.
Most economists, however, view the RBI's shift to Western-style inflation targeting under former Governor Raghuram Rajan, backed by setting a long-term central inflation target of 4 percent, as well entrenched.
Government officials say the MPC, in which the RBI governor has the casting vote in the event of a tie, should be in place by Patel's first policy meeting on Oct. 4. 

A drop in annual inflation to a five-month low of 5.05 percent - in the RBI's comfort zone - has opened the door to a possible rate cut next month or in December, say economists.

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen inched higher on Thursday as investors' sought safe havens in the face of a shaky atmosphere on stock markets, though major currency pairs were otherwise little changed ahead of a round of central bank meetings. 
The Bank of Japan and U.S. Federal Reserve both meet next week. They are preceded on Thursday by Swiss National Bank, which kept its expansive monetary policy intact, and the Bank of England, which is expected to do nothing extra for now. 
A busy day of U.S. and UK data, however, should give traders food for thought on the relative chances of another cut in British interest rates before the end of the year - and of a rise by the Fed. 
The yen move came despite an easing of the tensions on bond markets which have dominated the past week. Traders said sales of emerging market currencies by CTAs - largely model-based quantitative funds - continued to dominate trading by the bigger desks. 
""Despite yesterday's stability in global bonds, FX seems to be trading risk-off,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio management at London-based currency fund Millennium Global. 
""The problem with CTA money is that they are model-based so once they flick a switch it can go on for days. Clearly they had large exposures in emerging FX and that has been unwinding.""
Concerns about the policy effectiveness of the world's major central banks have triggered a steepening trend in bond yields since last Thursday and the yen's gains also looked like a vote against the Bank of Japan's ability to weaken the currency. 
Sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking said the central bank will consider making negative interest rates the focus of its future easing by shifting its prime policy target to interest rates from base money.
There is no consensus in the BOJ yet on whether to deepen negative rates at the Sept. 20-21 meeting, when it conducts the comprehensive assessment of its policies, the sources said.
""They are just running out of firepower and everyone knows it,"" said the head of currency and fixed income trading at one major U.S. asset manager in London, asking not to be named. 
""I am a 95 yen (per dollar) man.""
The dollar edged down 0.2 percent to 102.24 yen , moving away from a one-week high of 103.35 yen touched overnight.
""I was a bit surprised yesterday. I thought the yen might have been a little stronger, due to the risk-off mood,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. 
""But maybe the BOJ news had an effect. It's hard to say what will happen next week,"" he said.
The Fed also meets on Sept. 20-21, and contrasting comments from U.S. policymakers have led to uncertainty about the monetary outlook. 
While U.S. interest rate futures indicate expectations for an actual rate increase next week remain low, the dollar could get a lift from anything in the Fed's statement that hints at a hike this year. 
The euro edged down slightly to $1.1224 , and also slipped 0.2 percent against its Japanese counterpart to 115.00 yen .
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against a basket of six major rivals, was a touch higher at 95.508 (DXY), after wobbling in a narrow range this week between a low of 94.935 on Monday and a high of 95.672 on Tuesday.
Sterling dipped 0.2 percent to $1.3218 , having hit a two-week low of $1.3139 hit overnight, as investors awaited a Bank of England policy decision. An appearance by Mark Carney and colleagues in parliament last week suggested the Bank would look through an improvement in some economic data which has given the pound support since it cut interest rates to record lows and reintroduced an asset-purchase program in August.

Switzerland's central bank on Thursday held its negative interest rates at record low levels despite mounting criticism that the policy has hurt banks and pensions.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2016 10:47AM ET</span>","Dollar eases on uncertainty over BOJ, Fed policy","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar eased from an eight-day high against the yen on Wednesday after skepticism grew that the Bank of Japan would intensify its stimulative monetary policies next week, while uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy pressured the greenback against other currencies. 
The dollar eased from a session high of 103.34 yen touched in early trading and was last up just 0.05 percent against the Japanese currency at 102.58 yen . 
Sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking said the central bank would consider making negative interest rates the centerpiece of future easing by shifting its prime policy target to interest rates from base money.
Doubts grew, however, that the BOJ would take a more dovish stance at its meeting on Sept. 20-21 or that it would be able to significantly weaken the yen if it did ramp up its accommodative monetary policies. 
""When you sit back and think about it, how much of an impact will the BOJ actually have?"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. ""The market does perceive to a certain extent that the BOJ is tapped."" 
The BOJ shocked markets in January by cutting rates below zero for the first time in an attempt to weaken the yen, but the yen reaction was only temporary, and it has since gained more than 15 percent against the dollar. 
Analysts said uncertainty about the next development from the Fed prevented traders from making bullish bets on the greenback. The halt in the dollar's gains came after the greenback jumped against the euro and commodity currencies on Tuesday. 
Traders expect just a 15 percent chance that the Fed will hike rates next week, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. 
""On the dollar side, I think it’s more important what’s going on with the Fed,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
The Aussie  hit a nearly seven-week low against the dollar on Tuesday of $0.7443, but last traded slightly higher against the greenback at $0.7471. The New Zealand dollar <NZD=D4> was last 0.5 percent higher against the dollar at $0.7291 after hitting a more than one-week low of $0.7235 Tuesday. 

The euro was last up 0.21 percent against the dollar at $1.1240 <EUR=>. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last down 0.20 percent at 95.441 (DXY).

941,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2016 11:27AM ET</span>",Dollar recovers against commodity currencies on risk aversion,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained against the yen and riskier commodity currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars on Tuesday after the impact of dovish remarks from a top Federal Reserve official faded, boosting sentiment toward the greenback. 
The dollar had tumbled on Monday after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard reduced traders' bets on a rate hike by the central bank next week. Some analysts said, however, that the dollar was regaining ground after an exaggerated reaction to Brainard's comments on Monday. 
""The impact of Brainard might have been somewhat exaggerated really by the fact the market was already skewed towards thinking the Fed would not hike rates in September,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York.
Traders trimmed their odds for a September rate hike to 15 percent on Tuesday, from 24 percent on Friday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) further cut its view on the likelihood of a rate hike next week by the Fed, dropping it to just 25 percent, from 40 percent after Brainard's speech.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.29 percent at 95.372 (DXY). The dollar was up 0.31 percent against the yen at 102.16 yen after falling as low as 101.43 yen in early trading. 
The greenback touched a more than one-month high against the Australian dollar and a more than one-week high against the New Zealand dollar after falling against both currencies Monday in the wake of Brainard's remarks. Declines in oil prices also hurt the riskier commodity currencies on Tuesday. 
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were last down about a percent against the dollar. The Aussie  hit a session low against the greenback of $0.7486, while the New Zealand dollar hit a session low of $0.7271. 
""What I’m seeing this morning is primarily risk aversion,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. ""That’s kind of driving the dollar higher.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen strengthened on Monday as investors sold stocks and riskier assets including commodities, but the dollar outperformed higher-yielding currencies on fresh talk of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in the near term.
The focus will be on Fed Governor Lael Brainard's speech later in the day. The timing of a speech by the Fed's most-noted dove, just before the Fed's Open Market Committee blackout period, is too much of a coincidence for many in the markets with some expecting her to send a signal that further tightening is coming perhaps as early as this month
The dollar was 0.6 percent weaker  at 102.10 yen. But it gained against the euro  and rose 0.5 percent against the higher-yielding Australian dollar  and was firmer across the board against riskier emerging market currencies.
Currency investors were keeping an eye on the sell-off in global bonds, with perceived limits to central bank policies having taken German and Japanese sovereign bond yields to multi-month highs. U.S. Treasury yields have tracked their global peers higher, underpinning the dollar.
""Rising bond yields have the potential to put risk assets under significant selling pressure,"" said Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""A risk-averse trading strategy suggesting lower emerging markets and commodities and a higher dollar seems warranted. The dollar may rally 3 percent from here, but we think it is too early to assume a long-term rally to resume from here,"" he added.
While the stock market's fall was the main driver behind the yen's rise, the Japanese currency got a boost earlier in the Asian day from safe-haven flows in reaction to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton falling ill at a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony and being diagnosed with pneumonia.
Markets are mostly expecting Clinton to win the presidency in November and have not factored in the implications, both economic and for national security, should Republican nominee Donald Trump prevail.
FED SPEAKERS
A spate of Fed speakers kept hopes alive for a September rate hike, despite some recently disappointing economic data including only a modest rise in U.S. nonfarm payrolls. 
After Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengrenspoke on Friday, odds on a rate hike in September rose to a 30percent probability from 24 percent before his comments. Analysts said Rosengren's upbeat comments have set the stage for something similar from Brainard, despite subdued data.
""Brainard's speech will be the last scheduled appearance from a Fed policymaker ahead of the pre-meeting blackout period and many market participants see this as a last opportunity to for the Fed to fine-tune expectations ahead of the meeting,""  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) analysts said in a note.
The Fed meets on Sept. 20-21.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2016 05:07PM ET</span>","Speculators raise U.S. dollar bets this week: CFTC, Reuters data","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
(Reuters) - Speculators increased favorable bets on the U.S. dollar for the first time in six weeks, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
The value of the dollar's net long position rose to $9.10 billion in the week ended Sept. 6, from $5.29 billion the previous week, the data showed, with some investors unwinding extended positions on the greenback in the run-up to a Federal Reserve policy meeting this month.
Investors had been reducing long dollar positions since the beginning of August as U.S. data had come out softer than expected. That culminated in a U.S. non-farm payrolls report for August that was seen as less than stellar.
But since then, the dollar has regained its footing, supported by a slew of Fed speakers on Friday and over the past week suggesting a September rate hike was not exactly off the table despite what many view as a modest U.S. jobs number.
""The main takeaway from all of these comments is that despite slower job growth and weaker manufacturing and service sector activity, U.S. policymakers still believe rates should rise and this consistent message has not been lost on investors,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management in New York.
So far this year, the dollar index (DXY) has fallen more than 3 percent, down from 2015's gains of more than 9 percent.
Sterling net short positions, meanwhile, fell for a second straight week to 89,969, the data showed, after hitting record highs for six straight weeks. Investors have been net short the pound since November last year.
Sterling will also be a big focus next week with the Bank of England monetary policy announcement and a host of economic data such as UK inflation, employment, and retail sales.
Recent UK data has been solid, with manufacturing and service sector activity accelerating, suggesting that the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union has been limited so far. 
Japanese yen net long contracts, on the other hand, fell to 54,489, the lowest since mid-August.
The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

LONDON (Reuters) - North Korea's latest nuclear test pulled cash into the perceived safety of the Japanese yen and U.S. dollar on Friday, at the end of a week that has provided little clear direction for currency investors returning from U.S. and European summer breaks.
The dollar more broadly is down 1 percent or more for the week against most major currencies but it gained ground for a second day against the Korean won, and New Zealand and Australian dollars as news of the test filtered through. 
The announcement late in the European day on Thursday of a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard also had dealers speculating that she might draw back on her long-held scepticism about a near-term rise in interest rates. 
That helped eat into the euro's gains against the dollar after a European Central Bank meeting which quelled expectations of swift moves toward a further easing of policy that would flood the market with yet more euros next year. 
""Really the euro should have gained yesterday but this announcement of a Brainard speech right at the last moment before the blackout period for the Fed has made people nervous,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio management at currency fund Millennium Global in London. 
The euro and the yen's strength have been the nearest thing currency investors have had to a theme over the past few weeks. 
Both are looking extremely resilient in the face of expectations of more easing by the Bank of Japan and the ECB; as that looks substantially like a reflection of scepticism that either bank has enough fire power to weaken their currency durably. 
""I would say there's a lot of uncertainty on the yen, but on the euro yes there is doubt about the ECB's ability to do enough,"" Benson said. 
The dollar fell 0.4 percent against the yen in early trade in Europe on Friday and was on track for a weekly loss of 1.8 percent. 
The euro was also 0.1 percent higher at $1.1278, though that left it well short of Thursday's two-week highs above $1.13. 
North Korea announced on Friday it had conducted its fifth nuclear test, hours after seismic monitors detected a blast near the secretive country's nuclear test site.
A disappointing U.S. non-farm payrolls report a week ago and a weaker-than-expected service sector survey on Tuesday led some investors to trim bets that the Fed would be raising rates as early as this month, despite a chorus of Fed officials signaling that the time to hike was approaching. 
Several Fed officials are due to speak ahead of Brainard's speech on Monday. 
Jesper Bargmann, head of trading for Nordea Bank in Singapore, said the dollar would probably stay above 100 yen and trade toward 104 yen to 105 yen ahead of the monetary policy decisions by the BOJ and Fed this month

""I think we will see a slightly higher dollar/yen…on some expectation, even if it's small, of BOJ stepping into unknown territory,"" Bargmann said, referring to the possibility that the BOJ could aggressively expand its monetary stimulus.

978,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 08:36AM ET</span>",Euro hits 2-week high as markets bet on 'Draghi disappointment',"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-week high on Thursday after the European Central Banks left interest rates unchanged and stopped short of a formal commitment to further expand its huge asset-purchase program.
The ECB repeated that it would only extend its 1.74 trillion euro asset purchase program - intended to run until the end of March 2017 - if necessary, until it sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation target.
The decision to leave rates on hold was expected by almost all 70 analysts polled by Reuters but a sizable minority also expected an extension of the asset buys.
The euro gained 0.7 percent on the day to hit $1.1316  after the policy statement, its strongest since Aug. 26. The dollar also hit a two-week low of 94.514 against a basket of major currencies (DXY). 
""The bank does not mind holding back with respect to (using) more aggressive measures, but the (bigger) question is how long they can afford to wait given that they are very late in the game of QE,"" said ThinkMarkets analyst Naeem Aslam. 
Traders expected relatively little from a news conference by ECB chief Mario Draghi beginning at 1230 GMT.
""The bar is very, very high for Draghi to be able to deliver any sort of dovish surprise here,"" said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel, from London. ""It's really difficult to see him driving the euro lower."" 
""Our idea is that it's going to be a repeat of what we saw in May, with a Draghi disappointment – that's the balance of risks,"" he added. 
The euro is barely 3 percent weaker against the dollar than when the bond-purchase program was first announced, in January 2015, and it is up almost 4 percent this year. 
The yen edged up 0.2 percent against the dollar <JPY=> to 101.62 yen, clinging to gains of almost 3 percent made in the last four days, after a Bank of Japan deputy governor gave few fresh clues on whether the central bank will expand its monetary stimulus this month.
Analysts said the comments by BOJ Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso seemed similar in tone to remarks by BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda earlier this week, which acknowledged the costs of the BOJ's aggressive stimulus. 
""The main message doesn't seem all that different ... The general tone of weighing the costs and benefits were in Governor Kuroda's comments as well,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX and yen rates strategist for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
Data showing that China's imports unexpectedly rose in August for the first time in nearly two years helped lend support to the Australian dollar, which rose half a percent to hit a three-week high of $0.7716 .

986,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2016 05:40PM ET</span>",Behind Joe Stiglitz's dire view of the euro,"(Reuters) - Not only is the euro doomed, but the demise of the single currency is going to be a messy affair, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said on Wednesday. 
Discussing his latest book, ""The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe,"" the Columbia Business School don told the Reuters Global Markets Forum that Europe's already weak banking systems could face capital outflows.
Here are edited excerpts from the discussion:
Q: What is wrong with the euro?
A: The idea was driven by politics - by the desire to further European integration. The hope was that a single currency would lead to more prosperity, that in turn would lead to more solidarity, and in a virtuous circle, to more integration.
But the politics wasn't strong enough to create the institutions that would make a single currency work. So the euro was flawed at birth. The best of economic wizards could not have made the system work. But the economic policies have made matters worse. 
Q: What will be the signs to look for of unraveling? 
A: If a party committed to a referendum does well in the polls, it could trigger capital outflows, putting the banking system into jeopardy.
Best of all would be for Europe to reform the eurozone - ""finish"" the project, introduce quickly a banking union, most importantly common deposit insurance, a solidarity fund to help countries facing a crisis, a commitment by surplus countries to ""inflate"" their economies slightly, rather than forcing deficit countries to deflate, eurobond, shift from austerity to growth.
Q: Will we see fiscal policy take over from monetary policy in rich countries?
A: I am optimistic about the effectiveness of fiscal policy, especially investments in infrastructure, technology, and higher and pre-school education. 
I do not worry (too much) about moral hazard. We have such an infrastructure deficit that it will be easy to find high-return projects. The EIB and other development banks like CAFE have a very impressive record. 
QE has provided some limited stimulus to the economy, but at a cost--the risk of asset bubbles, an increase in inequality (poor retirees depending on T-bill returns have been hurt, rich owners of equities have been helped), and an encouragement for firms to invest in capital intensive technologies, making a ""jobless"" recovery more likely. 
That's why I think it imperative that we switch to fiscal policy.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell to its lowest in more than a week against the yen on Wednesday as subdued U.S. data made an interest rate increase this month unlikely and drove investors to cut favorable bets in the greenback.
In Europe, sterling  fell for the first time in six days against the dollar hurt by weak factory data. It was 0.5 percent lower at $1.3375 with the focus on Bank of England chief Mark Carney's testimony to lawmakers. His appearance comes after a slew of robust data in the past week saw fears of a recession in the near term abate.
The dollar was down 0.45 percent at 101.50 yen  after dipping as low as 101.20 earlier, its lowest since Aug. 26 --when Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen gave an upbeat speech on the economy that revived bets of a rate hike in the near term.
Since then, the dollar has been struggling to make headway and tumbled more than 1 percent against the yen on Tuesday.
""Since the Jackson Hole speech, the implied probability of Fed's rate hike for its September meeting fell from 42 percent to 24 percent and the 2-year Treasury yield dipped by around 10 basis points,"" said Petr Krpata, currency strategist at ING.
""Clearly, this is a challenging environment for the dollar.""
The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 51.4 last month, far short of economists' expectations and the largest one-month drop since November 2008.
The Fed's labour-market conditions index also fell in August, slipping back into negative territory after a positive reading in July.
Nonetheless, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in prepared remarks late on Thursday that the economy was in ""good shape"" and that it ""makes sense to get back to a pace of gradual rate increases, preferably sooner rather than later."" Williams did not directly cite Thursday's data.
Despite the upbeat rhetoric from the Fed,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts do not expect the Fed to hike at all this year as the U.S. economy is expected to slow down from here.
""For the rates market to adjust accordingly, it may require the Fed to change its language, which has not happened yet as Williams illustrated overnight,"" Morgan Stanley strategists said in note, adding once the Fed adjusts its communication, the dollar would fall against the euro and the yen at a faster pace.
Also helping the yen was the Sankei newspaper's report saying Bank of Japan policymakers were divided ahead of the central bank's Sept. 20-21 meeting, at which BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the board will conduct a comprehensive assessment of its massive stimulus programme.
Despite the dollar's weakness, the euro  underperformed, hurt by data that showed German industrial production post its steepest fall in nearly two years in July. 
The European Central Bank holds its next Governing Council meeting on Thursday, where it is expected to keep policy steady.

Meanwhile, Sweden's crown (EURSEK=) rose to a day's high against the euro of 9.50 crowns per euro amid relief that the Riksbank stood pat on rates, as expected. The crown had fallen to a one-year low last week after a slew of weak economic data.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2016 12:33PM ET</span>",Dollar dips versus yen as bets on imminent BOJ easing fade,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the yen on Monday after the head of the Bank of Japan disappointed investors who had expected a clear signal that monetary policy would be eased further this month. 
The greenback hit a five-week high on Friday as markets bet that the U.S. Federal Reserve was still likely to raise interest rates in the coming months, despite disappointing U.S. jobs numbers.
But having gained more than 4 percent against the Japanese currency in six days, the dollar stalled in markets thinned by the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday, slipping as much as 0.8 percent, to 103.15 yen . 
Though Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda signaled his readiness to further expand an already massive stimulus program, he did not provide the explicit hints that some had been waiting for on the chances of the BOJ aggressively easing policy at its next review on Sept. 20-21.
""The fact that Governor Kuroda gave a portion of his speech to outlining the negative impact of lowering rates below zero percent helped to ease speculation of further cuts to the key policy rate and helped lift the yen,"" said Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ currency strategist Derek Halpenny. 
From Zurich, UBS's head of currency strategy Constantin Bolz said the factors that had driven the dollar up against the yen - namely growing expectations of a Fed hike in September and bets on imminent further BOJ easing - had faded somewhat, but that a fall-back was not surprising given the rapidity of the move. 
""We shouldn't forget that we were at 100 yen 10 days ago,"" Bolz said. 
""The (U.S.) labour market wasn't great ... so that took out a bit of steam from the dollar side, and then Kuroda didn't say anything too clear about further easing at the end of September and so now markets have to level out their bets a little bit."" 
Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed that currency speculators increased their bets on the yen in the week ending Aug. 30, but had cut their long U.S. dollar bets to an 8-week low.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies (DXY), stood at 95.758, managing to stay above a one-week low of 95.189 set on Friday just after the U.S. payrolls data.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 jobs last month, below the 180,000 jobs that economists had expected.
Markets are now pricing in a just over one in five chance that U.S. rates will be increased in September, and a just over 50 percent chance that they will be hiked by the end of the year - down from around a 55 percent chance priced in last week before the jobs data, according to CME FedWatch.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2016 06:00AM ET</span>","China, U.S. commit to refrain from competitive currency devaluations","HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - China and the United States on Sunday committed anew to refrain from competitive currency devaluations, and China said it would continue an orderly transition to a market-oriented exchange rate for the yuan .
A joint ""fact sheet"", issued a day after U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held talks, also said the two countries had committed ""not to unnecessarily limit or prevent commercial sales opportunities for foreign suppliers of ICT (information and communications technology) products or services"".
While China and the United States cooperate closely on a range of global issues, including North Korea's disputed nuclear program and climate change, the two countries have deep disagreements in other areas, like cyberhacking and human rights.
Both countries said they would ""refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes"", the fact sheet said.
Meanwhile, China would ""continue an orderly transition to a market-determined exchange rate, enhancing two-way flexibility. China stresses that there is no basis for a sustained depreciation of the RMB (yuan). Both sides recognize the importance of clear policy communication.""
China shocked global markets by devaluing the yuan in August 2015 and allowing it to slip sharply again early this year. Though it has stepped in to temper losses in recent weeks, the currency is still hovering near six-year lows against the dollar.
Xi and Obama met in Hangzhou in eastern China where leaders from the world's 20 leading economies, the G20, were gathering for a summit on Sunday and Monday.
Foreign business groups say China's pending cyber rules, including a cyber security law that could be passed this year, include provisions for invasive government security reviews and onerous requirements to keep data in China.
They say the regulations would create barriers to market entry for foreign companies and impair the country's security by isolating it technologically.
Global business groups spanning finance, information technology, insurance and manufacturing have urged China to revise its draft rules, and have pressed the U.S. government to raise the issue with Beijing.
The fact sheet said the two sides had committed to policies that ""should treat technology in a non-discriminatory manner (and not) unnecessarily limit or prevent commercial sales opportunities for foreign suppliers of ICT products or services"".
Other points from the fact sheet:
- Both sides commit to use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – to foster confidence and strengthen growth; fiscal policy should be used flexibly to strengthen growth, job creation and household demand.
- Building on current progress, China is to deepen supply-side structural reforms with a comprehensive strategy, including state-owned enterprise reform, giving full play to the role of the market and legal mechanisms, to reduce corporate debt, including SOE debt.
- The two sides recognize that structural problems, including excess capacity in some industries, have caused a negative impact on trade and workers; both countries recognize that excess capacity in steel and other industries is a global issue which requires collective responses.
- Both sides recognize that the effective and balanced protection of intellectual property rights will be beneficial to promote innovation. 

- They welcome the completion of peer review reports on the fossil fuel subsidies of the United States and China.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped on Friday after jobs growth in August came in below expectations, reducing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when it meets later this month.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 151,000 jobs last month after an upwardly revised 275,000 increase in July, with job losses in manufacturing and construction sectors, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent as more people entered the labor market.
Hawkish statements from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer last week had increased expectations that the U.S. central bank is closer to raising rates, though most investors see one increase in December as most likely if the Fed hikes this year.
“There were no positive standouts here, the key underlying data were all pretty soft as well,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. “This should put to rest the conversation on September.”

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 09:34AM ET</span>",Dollar set to gain slightly with upside risks on Fed cue: Reuters poll,"By Shrutee Sarkar and Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will rise modestly in the year ahead with risks skewed to the upside on renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon, according to foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters.
Speculators cut bets in favor of the dollar through August, but the U.S. currency (DXY) rose this week, hitting a three-week high against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, after a host of Fed officials, including Chair Janet Yellen, revived near-term rate hike prospects.
Traders are waiting for official August jobs data due for release on Friday to see if the U.S. labor market is strong enough to justify the Fed's tighter monetary policy stance, although relatively subdued inflation also remains an obstacle.
Expectations for the timing of a Fed rate hike have see-sawed, sending the dollar down almost 3 percent this year after making near double-digit gains in calendar 2015 and 2014.
Still, the poll of over 70 strategists taken this week showed the euro  is forecast to weaken 3 percent against the dollar in a year from Thursday's $1.11.
The single currency is forecast to slip to around $1.10 in a month, to $1.09 in three and then further to $1.08 in a year.
Although that consensus is almost unchanged from last month, a slim majority of strategists now say the risk is that the dollar gains much more than predicted, even as an unusually dramatic race to capture the White House looms in November.
Just last month, a majority had forecast the risks to their dollar forecasts were skewed more to the downside.
""Jackson Hole delivered a further rise in the market's confidence that the Fed will hike rates this year. That doesn't mean the Fed will actually do anything of course - they and the market have cried wolf before,"" said Kit Juckes, global strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), referring to the Fed's conference this past weekend in Wyoming.
""But the scene is set for the summer calm to be interrupted by much Fed speculation along with an increased focus on the U.S. presidential election. Still, I'm getting a slightly stronger dollar out of all this, which is something. Not an earth-shattering move..., but my bias remains to be bullish.""
While downside risks remain for the dollar in the run-up to the November election, a smaller sample of strategists who answered an extra question said the U.S. currency would benefit most if Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton is voted president. She currently leads in nearly all opinion polls. 
But for broad dollar moves, the focus is on the timing of a Fed rate hike, as most other major central banks are expected to stick to expansive monetary policy.
The Bank of Japan is widely expected to ease further this month when it reviews its stimulus program, as the economy barely grew in the quarter through to June and inflation is nowhere close to the central bank's 2 percent target. [ECILT/JP]
What has also not helped is the yen's strength against the dollar - it is up almost 14 percent this year - despite extraordinary measures such as a negative interest rate and ongoing massive asset purchases from the BoJ.
But the latest poll still shows the yen is expected to weaken close to 4 percent against the dollar from Thursday's 104. The currency is predicted to weaken against the dollar to 102 in a month, 103 in three months and to 108 in a year.
Those expectations are similar to last month's poll but conflict with positioning data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which showed speculators increased their bets in favor of the yen to the highest since early July.
Bets against the British pound have set record highs for six straight weeks.
Still, the latest poll showed sterling's steep slide of over 10 percent since Britain voted in June to quit the European Union has mostly run its course and now is expected to weaken only slightly over the coming year. [GBP/POLL]
The pound is forecast to fall close to 4 percent over the next six months from Thursday's $1.32. It is then expected to trade at $1.29 in a year.

""With many negatives in the price already, we doubt that GBP will drop through recent lows against USD and EUR,"" wrote Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at CA-CIB, in a note to clients.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 09:10AM ET</span>","Insurance companies, pension funds dominate currency trading: BIS","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - Non-bank financial institutions like insurance companies, mutual funds and pension funds account for more than 50 percent of daily turnover in the currency market, a survey of the foreign exchange market showed on Thursday.
Their share of the market reflects growing demand for hedging through foreign exchange swaps, the triennial survey by the Bank for International Settlements showed.
That backed up anecdotal evidence and trends from other surveys that large pension funds and insurance companies raised their hedging requirements to protect themselves from sharp currency fluctuations during the period between 2013-2016. That period saw the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank embark on massive bond-buying programs along while the Federal Reserve started to tighten policy.
Derivatives are a key tool for asset owners as they often provide a cost effective hedge against sharp currency fluctuations, leading to lower costs and in most cases limiting the downside risks.
Average daily foreign exchange swap turnover with institutional investors as a counterparty rose to $278 billion by April 2016, a 79 percent increase compared with the 2013 survey, the BIS survey showed.
PROP TRADERS HIT
The rise in financial institutions' share of trading contrasts with a drop for hedge funds and proprietary trading firms. Tougher regulatory rules have seen a decline in prop trading, especially by banks which have drastically cut down on currency trading on their own behalf. 
Average daily spot turnover with hedge funds and proprietary trading firms as a counterparty was $200 billion in April 2016, a 29 percent decline compared with the 2013 survey. Trading in outright forwards and FX swaps also declined, by 29 percent and 37 percent, respectively.
In the past few years, a key driver of growth in the foreign exchange market has been the proliferation of prime brokers, hedge funds and high frequency traders. But hedge funds have suffered in the past while large banks have withdrawn from prime broking space, leaving currency markets often at the mercy of algorithmic traders.
""It is also important to note that one of the biggest game-changers in recent years has been the rise in non-bank market-makers in the FX market, significantly altering market structure as we know it,"" said Dan Marcus, CEO of ParFX, an electronic trading platform.

Meanwhile, the share of trading between banks also rose for the first time since 1995, the survey showed. Banks often trade on behalf of customers such as companies and tend to actively deal through electronic platforms, such as EBS or Reuters dealing facilities.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.08% at 96.10.
Traders were looking to the latest data on the strength of the U.S. labor market for indications on how soon the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again.
Earlier in the week, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the U.S. labor market is almost at full strength and the pace of interest rate increases will be data dependent.
The dollar has strengthened since Fed Chair Janet Yellen said late last week that the case for raising U.S. interest rates has strengthened in recent months, citing improvements in the labor market.
The U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade in December.
Expectations of higher interest rates typically boost the dollar by making it more attractive to yield seeking investors.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar's advance against the yen stalled on Thursday with investors positioning for Friday's non-farm jobs report, which is set to shape the market's near-term U.S. interest rate expectations.
In Europe, the focus was on sterling and the UK manufacturing PMI survey for August, following a run of generally more upbeat-than-expected data that has taken the edge off concerns about a sharp decline in economic activity following June's Brexit vote. 
Sterling  was trading 0.1 percent higher at $1.3150 ahead of the PMI report, due at 0830 GMT and expected to show a contraction, albeit less sharp than in July.
The dollar index (DXY), was flat at 96.050, pulling back from a three-week peak of 96.255. Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 103.29 yen , having hit a one-month high of 103.540 yen on Wednesday after a slightly stronger-than-expected ADP Report for August. 
Its rise was tempered after the August Chicago purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell short of expectations.
""There are still some skeptics who are still not convinced that the Fed will take action (on rates) again this year,"" said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""They have been misled by the Fed one too many times over the past few months in their hope for a rapid rate hike cycle following the lift-off.""
Praefcke said those investors would have to rethink their positions and buy the dollar if the U.S. labor market report was stronger than forecast.
The dollar made significant gains following comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen last Friday at a central bankers' gathering in Jackson Hole that revived near-term rate hike prospects.
""The dollar and Treasury yields had risen in tandem following Jackson Hole last week but that phase came to an end yesterday. The dollar will not be making much further headway before Friday's non-farm employment report,"" said Shin Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
The Australian dollar rose after PMI data showed activity in China's manufacturing sector picked up unexpectedly in August, albeit modestly. 

The Aussie, often used as a proxy for China-related trades, edged up 0.3 percent to $0.7540  after plumbing a one-month trough of $.07490 on Wednesday.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2016 03:00PM ET</span>","Dollar gives up gains, jobs data in focus","By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell from three-week highs against a basket of currencies on Wednesday after weak manufacturing data dented some optimism about U.S. economic growth ahead of a highly anticipated jobs report on Friday.
Hawkish comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer last week increased expectations the U.S. central bank is moving closer to an interest rate hike.
Fischer has said that jobs data for August due on Friday will be a consideration for when the Fed raises rates. Employers are expected to have added 180,000 jobs in August, according to the median estimate of 89 economists polled by Reuters. [ECONUS]
The greenback rose to session highs after the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers adding 177,000 jobs in August, slightly above the 175,000 forecast by a Reuters survey of economists.
Private payroll gains in July were revised up to 194,000 from 179,000.
“The upward revision was encouraging, for ... August it was pretty close to expectations,” said Richard Franulovich, a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corporation in New York.
The dollar fell from the day's highs, however, after the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer fell 4.3 points to 51.5 in August, below expectations.
The manufacturing sector is lagging gains in the economy as factories continue to process the lingering effects of the dollar's past rally and oil price collapse.
An update on Chinese factory activity will also be in focus later on Wednesday.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six majors, rose as high as to 96.255 (DXY), its highest since Aug. 9, before falling back to 96.005, marginally down on the day.
The greenback gained against the yen to 103.39 yen <JPY=>, after hitting 103.53, its highest since July 29.
The dollar also hit three-week highs against the euro after data on Wednesday showed euro zone inflation was stable in August, contrary to expectations of a slight rise and piling more pressure on the European Central Bank to act.
The euro <EUR=> weakened to $1.1121, the lowest since Aug. 10, before recovering to $1.1152.

Most investors do not expect further policy measures when the ECB’s rate-setting Governing Council meets next week, though Westpac’s Franulovich noted that the recent string of weak data has increased speculation that further easing could be possible.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2016 04:14AM ET</span>",Dollar off highs as investors seek more U.S. rates guidance,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar held firm on Tuesday, just below the previous day's high as investors focused on the next set of U.S. data to see whether it supports expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon.
Despite hawkish comments last week from both Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer, markets still price in less than 50 percent chance of a rate rise in September.
The next key indicator is Friday's jobs report while Fischer, who said that the data could weigh on the decision over a hike, is due to speak again later on Tuesday in a television interview.
U.S. data on Monday showed consumer spending increased for a fourth straight month, pointing to a pickup in growth.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six majors, rose to 95.804 (DXY), just shy of Monday's peak of 95.834 which was its highest since Aug. 12. It has risen more than 1.5 percent since Friday's low of 94.246 plumbed before Yellen's and Fischer's upbeat comments at the Jackson Hole central bankers' symposium.
""The dollar's appreciation following Jackson Hole was rather moderate,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""And should the Fed really hike interest rates two more times this year as Fischer considers possible, considerably more dollar strength would have to be expected. But the market does not believe that anyway.""
Friday's U.S. employment report is expected to show an increase of 180,000 jobs in August, according to the median estimate of 89 economists polled by Reuters, below the better-than-expected 255,000 additions in July.
""It's hard to move until we see the jobs figures, after Fischer stressed that the August report would be a key factor, and that an interest rate hike could follow good numbers,"" said Kumiko Ishikawa, senior FX analyst at Gaitame.Com Research Institute in Tokyo.
Against the low-yielding yen, the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 102.35 yen , just below Monday's 102.39, its highest since Aug. 9. 
Asked of Tokyo could intervene in the currency market to stem excessive yen rises, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday the government was ready to respond ""appropriately"".
Underpinning the yen, data showed Japanese household spending fell less than expected last month and the jobless rate hit a two-decade low.

But with the economy barely growing and inflation sliding further away from the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, most economists polled by Reuters expect the bank to ease further next month.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2016 03:40AM ET</span>",Japan top spokesman signals readiness to stem yen gains,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's chief cabinet secretary has signaled Tokyo's readiness to intervene in the market if the yen spikes out of line with fundamentals and defended the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy.
Yoshihide Suga, one of premier Shinzo Abe's closest aides, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday the government will respond ""appropriately"" to unwelcome yen gains that hurt growth.
He also stressed the need to respect the BOJ's independence from political interference, a sign the government will not get in the way if the bank opts to deepen negative rates to stimulate the economy.
Suga's comments come as Japan struggles to get on a solid growth track. Its economy ground to a halt in April-June and analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest, as weak global growth and the yen's 20 percent rise against the dollar this year have hurt exports and capital spending.
He said yen moves were a key debate topic at a regular meeting he created that gathers senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Services Agency and the BOJ.
""Through the meetings, the government will closely watch market moves and respond appropriately,"" the top government spokesman said, when asked whether Tokyo could intervene in the market if the yen spikes abruptly.
In a prepared speech later at a Reuters newsmaker event, Suga stressed the government's resolve to respond ""decisively"" to excessive market moves.
The comments suggest Tokyo is not letting its guard down against the risk of a renewed yen spike, even as recent hawkish messages from U.S. Federal Reserve officials push up the dollar to around 102 yen, off lows below 100 hit this month.
POLICY COORDINATION INTACT
Japanese officials have repeatedly threatened currency intervention to deal with their headache of a strong yen. But they have held off for fear of infuriating Washington, which has warned against intervention that could be seen as seeking to give Japanese companies an unfair competitive advantage.
The BOJ's decision in January to adopt negative interest rates has failed to arrest yen gains and drawn market criticism for hurting financial institutions' profits.
Under pressure from Abe's administration, the BOJ eased last month by expanding purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF). A majority of economists expect the bank to act again next month.
Asked if the BOJ had room to cut rates further, Suga said negative rates and any other steps the BOJ takes would give financial institutions ""huge"" benefits if they boost the economy.
On whether Japan could resort to ""helicopter money"", or direct central bank underwriting of government debt, Suga said there was no clear definition of what helicopter meant.
He added it was important for the government and the BOJ to work closely together to beat deflation.
""The BOJ will conduct a review of its policies to achieve its 2 percent target. In any case, it's important not to impair fiscal policy and the BOJ's independence,"" he said.
In a case of coordination last month, the government announced a spending package shortly after the BOJ eased policy, Suga said.
""I'm confident that we will see results if the government and the BOJ coordinate policies,"" he said.

Data released on Tuesday showed household spending remained stubbornly weak in July even as the jobless rate hit a 21-year low.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2016 04:40PM ET</span>",Banorte projects sharply weaker Mexican peso next year,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican peso will continue to weaken next year due to low global oil prices and falling Mexican crude production that will widen the country's current account deficit, according to strategists at Mexican bank Banorte-IXE said on Monday.
Banorte strategists, led by Gabriel Casillas, said they expect the peso  to trade at 19.80 per dollar by the end of next year. They also revised their outlook for the end of 2016 to 18.50 per dollar from 17.60 per dollar.
""We believe the peso needs to fall further in 2017 given the likely prospects of persistent headwinds for the oil sector and to help correcting a wider imbalance in external accounts,"" Banorte wrote.
Relative to the dollar, Banorte's projection of 19.80 per dollar is 6 percent weaker than Friday's close of 18.60 per dollar and it is 8 percent weaker than the median 2017 estimate of 18.20 in a poll from the central bank published early in August.
Banorte said it expected a further drop in Mexican oil production, low oil prices and fiscal challenges facing the state-run oil company Pemex would continue to pressure the currency. 
Some models suggest the peso is already deeply undervalued, Banorte said. It added, however, that these failed to take recent structural changes, particularly in the oil sector, into account.

""The double whammy of low crude-oil prices and falling production suggests continued weakness for the country’s current account balance at least until next year,"" Banorte said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a three-week high against the yen on Monday after senior Federal Reserve officials bolstered expectations that U.S. interest rates would rise soon.
Treasury yields rose (US2YT=RR) (US10YT=RR) to their highest since June and rate futures indicated the market priced in more than a 30 percent chance of a hike in September, up from 18 percent before Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her deputy Stanley Fischer spoke on Friday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Against a basket of major currencies (DXY), the dollar hit its highest in nearly two weeks at 95.724 with the euro  down 0.2 percent at $1.1182.
At the Fed's annual gathering for global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen said the case for an interest rate hike has strengthened in recent months as the labor market and economy improved.
She gave no hints on the timing of a hike, but Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said her speech was consistent with expectations for possible rate increases this year. Those comments created a flutter among dollar bulls.
""Fischer confirmed the broad view on the Fed Open Market Committee that the economy has strengthened of late and that interest rates should be raised gradually; possibly again next month if this week's employment report supports a rate rise,"" said Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG Wealth Management.
""U.S. rates are likely to rise, whereas the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England are still looking to ease policy. This policy divergence should be supportive for the dollar.""
In the past few months, the Fed has been swaying back and forth on whether to raise rates this year, keeping the dollar in check. Fischer said Friday's non-farm payrolls report for August was likely to be key on the decision over a hike in the near term.
Traders said a strong number could see the dollar break out of its recent ranges. 
""If the payrolls figure is strong, the dollar could move toward a test of the 105 level against the yen,"" said Mitsuo Imaizumi, chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. 
Despite the chorus of hawkish comments from Fed officials in recent days, speculators trimmed bets on the dollar for a fourth straight week in the week ended Aug. 23, reducing net dollar-long positions to their lowest since early July. [IMM/FX]

Concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy remain, and were underscored by Friday's second estimate of U.S. gross domestic product that showed second-quarter growth was slightly lower than previously thought.

Speaking shortly afterwards, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said Yellen’s speech was “consistent” with expectations for possibly two more rate hikes this year, opening the door to a September hike.

""The current deposit reserve ratio of 16.5% is relatively high both compared with historical levels and to other countries. The benchmark depositrate is not near a zero interest rate either. Maintaining a reasonably ample liquidity level and creating a reasonably accommodative monetary environment will help guide market interest rates lower,"" said Cao Yujin, a NDRC researcher who wrote the article, published in the news section of the NDRC website.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2016 04:25AM ET</span>",Dollar dips in quiet market as Yellen dominates,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar inched down on Friday to leave it little changed on the week, with investors focused on a speech later the day by the chair of the Federal Reserve that may provide clarity on whether U.S. interest rates will rise this year.
Janet Yellen's keynote address at a global gathering of central bankers in the U.S. mountain resort of Jackson Hole is due at 1400 GMT.
She could send a clear signal that the Fed is gearing up for a hike this year, though many analysts believe she will take a more equivocal line - that monetary policy is data-dependent and a rate hike this year is just a possibility. 
Futures markets are pricing in only around a 1 in 5 chance of a rate hike in September, and around a 50 percent chance of at least one by the end of the year, according to CME FedWatch. Any clear signal that a 2016 hike is on the cards could therefore send the dollar surging. 
Commerzbank's head of foreign exchange research in Frankfurt, Ulrich Leuchtmann, said he saw more of a risk of a negative surprise for the greenback from the speech.
""For the best part of this week there was a sense that Jackson Hole might bring something useful on policy, but this shifted yesterday and for good reason, because I don't think the Fed has any incentive to make a big hawkish announcement,"" he said. ""They are so data-dependent.""
Data overnight reinforced recent upbeat assessments of the U.S. economy. New orders for manufactured capital goods rose for a second straight month in July, while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly dropped.
The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major counterparts, edged down 0.2 percent to 94.608 (DXY), roughly where it started the week. 
The dollar inched down 0.1 percent to 100.44 yen . 
""I don't think (Yellen's) speech will bring a new dollar/yen trend,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""If Yellen shows less confidence about the U.S. economy, maybe people would like to buy the yen more, but I also think there are long-term investors who step in to buy dollars whenever it falls below 100 yen.""
Japanese data released early on Friday added to evidence that the Bank of Japan has reason to increase its stimulus next month, as the economy slips back toward deflation.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2016 06:58AM ET</span>",Dollar slips as investors await Yellen's Jackson Hole speech,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Thursday as some investors sold the currency before the annual global central bankers' gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen may offer new pointers on U.S. monetary policy. 
Recent hawkish statements by Fed officials including Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley have prompted some investors to raise bets that U.S. interest rates will rise sooner rather than later, and some believe Yellen could echo their signals.
Futures markets were on indicating an 21 percent chance the Fed will hike rates at its policy meeting next month and a roughly 50 percent chance of an increase in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch.
But data of late has pointed to sluggish productivity and subdued inflation, suggesting the Fed could stay on hold for longer. The uncertainty over whether Yellen would flag another rate hike or not was enough to keep most investors on the sidelines and the dollar subdued.
""Markets continue to dither as we await Yellen's speech. The Fed chair may have little to say on the near-term prospects for a rate hike, which could see the market knee-jerking one way or the other,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank.
The dollar was a tad weaker at 100.40 yen , having dipped below 100 yen in recent days. The pair has traded in a narrow 99.55-102.83 band this month, but some traders said it could stage a rally if Yellen laid the ground for a rate hike.
""Dudley's hawkish comments have come as a surprise and if Yellen says the U.S. data has been good enough to continue tightening policy, then we could see dollar/yen rally towards the 102 yen mark,"" said Richard Falkenhall, currency strategist at SEB.
The yen could also come under pressure on growing expectations that the Bank of Japan will take additional stimulus steps at its next meeting in September, when it will review its policies against a backdrop of growing doubts that the BOJ's target of 2 percent inflation target is within reach. 
Japan's government kept its assessment of the economy unchanged in August but offered a slightly more downbeat view on consumer inflation than last month, as prices slid on weak household spending and the strong yen pushed down import costs.
A Reuters poll on Thursday showed economists were split over whether the BOJ will ease policy further next month, with about 60 percent forecasting it will and 40 percent expecting no change.

The euro was higher at $1.1295 , sidestepping a weak German IFO survey. The survey showed German business morale deteriorated sharply in August posting the steepest monthly drop since the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2012, as the Brexit shock weighed on sentiment among executives.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2016 04:08PM ET</span>",Dollar advances as traders look to Yellen for rate hike clues,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday in thin trading, helped by data the previous day showing a surge in U.S. new home sales, but gains were capped by uncertainty ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at a central bankers' conference on Friday.
Policymakers from across the globe will gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming later this week, with the focus squarely on Yellen. Investors expect her to provide guidance on the Fed's next rate hike. The U.S. central bank raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December, but has held off further moves so far this year. 
Late on Wednesday, futures markets assigned an 18 percent chance the Fed would hike rates at its policy meeting next month, and a roughly 50 percent odds of a rate increase in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. 
Any indication that a September hike is in the cards should produce a dollar surge, analysts said.
Recent hawkish comments from Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley have raised expectations that Yellen might shift to a less cautious stance, though some investors remain doubtful. 
""While recent Fed officials have signaled that rates could rise as early as September, Mrs. Yellen's reputation as a policy dove has kept many traders skeptical that she'll echo last week's hawkish Fed comments,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
Data showing a fall in U.S. existing home sales for the month of July did not have much impact on the dollar. The report from the National Association of Realtors followed data on Tuesday that showed U.S. new home sales surged to nearly a nine-year high last month.
Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 94.764 (DXY). 
The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 100.40 .
The British pound, meanwhile, rose to a three-week high against the dollar at $1.3227 . The recent slate of surprisingly stronger-than-expected economic data after Britain's vote to leave the European Union has helped temper expectations of further Bank of England monetary easing.
""The fundamental backdrop certainly support a continued move higher here in sterling/dollar and this could give caution to shorts or those carrying a bearish bias in the near-term,"" said James Stanley, currency analyst at DailyFX in New York.

The euro, meanwhile, was down 0.4 percent at $1.1264 , weighed by the dollar's overall strength.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2016 07:14AM ET</span>",Dollar dips on Fed rate hike doubts,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar weakened across the board on Tuesday, as investors shifted their focus away from hawkish remarks on U.S. interest rates by Federal Reserve officials and towards a speech on Friday by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. 
The greenback was given a boost over the weekend when Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the Fed was getting close to its job and inflation targets, prompting speculation that a rate hike could come as soon as September. 
But having hit a five-day high of 94.958 (DXY) against a basket of currencies in early trade on Monday, the dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 94.411, taking it close to a two-month low of 94.077 touched last week. 
Yellen will speak at the annual meeting of world central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the end of the week. 
""Will Yellen deliver anything this Friday?"" asked Saxo Bank's head of currency strategy in London, John Hardy. ""She has been a very cautious mover since assuming the helm in early 2014.""
Investors are anxious to see whether Yellen will echo the hawkish views expressed by Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley, or take a more subdued stance in line with the July Fed policy meeting minutes, which suggested the central bank was not in a hurry to raise rates. 
""There's still a huge amount of scepticism as to whether the Fed really can hike, irrespective of the hawkish remarks we've heard from Fed bankers,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, from London. 
The dollar briefly dipped below 100 yen  in early trade before recovering to 100.165 yen by 1045 GMT, leaving it down 0.2 percent on the day. 
The biggest mover among developed-world currencies on Tuesday was the New Zealand dollar, which rose as much as 1 percent to $0.7340  after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said he did not see the need for a rapid succession of interest rate cuts.
The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.1332 , close to last week's two-month high of $1.1366. Data showed euro zone private business activity was stable in August, albeit at a muted level, alleviating some concerns that Britain's vote to leave the European Union would spill over negatively into the currency bloc.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2016 02:20AM ET</span>",Currency market struggles despite Brexit night bounce,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Graham had been trying to grab some sleep at home before a busy night's work when his phone started buzzing with text messages.
It was 10 p.m. on June 23, and voting had just ended in Britain's referendum on its future in the European Union. What followed was one of the biggest nights in the history of his business, the $5 trillion-a-day global currency market.
The next few hours were an exhilarating time for Graham, a dealer who lives by his wits in a fast-moving market - but who also belongs to an old school of traders that has shrunk due to major changes in the banking industry since the global financial crisis.
The text messages were from sales staff at the international bank where London-based Graham works as a proprietary trader, managing up to a $150 million in trades at a time using his employer's own funds.
Graham had planned to start trading later on referendum night, but they alerted him to an opinion poll suggesting voters had opted for the status quo. Then as the results began rolling in, the truth dawned: the poll was wrong and Britons had decided to leave the EU, leading to the kind of market volatility and huge turnover in which traders make - or lose - their money.
""Sales guys woke me up with messages about the poll and from then on I was just wired,"" said Graham. ""I just had a ball. It was the most fun I've had trading in years.""
Graham requested anonymity in speaking to Reuters - few dealers have been willing be named in the media since a market-rigging scandal hit their industry - but was happy to relate his experiences on the night Britons voted for Brexit.
Sitting in his home office, he made the first of several dozen deals worth millions of dollars that would end in a profit of several million the next morning.
The pound rose on the poll, only to dive on the results, marking its biggest swings since it was floated freely in 1973. The yen shot up against the dollar as investors opted for the perceived safety of the Japanese currency but later weakened.
""Actually I lost money on sterling initially, but I caught the yen move at the right time and from then on I was just trading in and out till about 10 the next morning,"" he said.
Turnover that night was huge. Currency trading platform EBS has said that daily volumes at least doubled to top $200 billion while spot trading in currencies on platforms owned by Thomson Reuters jumped by three times.
The question is: how many more days will there be like the night of June 23-24? 
DWINDLING BREED
Traders like Graham have long been at the heart of the currency market, world's biggest and whose capital is London. Their buying and selling of large amounts of currencies has helped to maintain a deep pool of liquidity, but a series of changes in financial regulations and banks' business models means they are a dwindling breed.
Decades of largely uninterrupted growth in the currency business has stalled since it topped $5 trillion a day in 2013.
GRAPHIC - http://tmsnrt.rs/2bAGZzJ
A three-yearly report by the Bank for International Settlements due in September is expected to show volumes have now fallen.
Banks, spurred by regulators' demands that they hold more capital following the 2007-09 global crisis, have been rethinking their approach to the business. This has involved moving away from aggressive trading on their own account.
GRAPHIC - http://tmsnrt.rs/2bp7JH2 
This proprietary dealing in spot currencies and options has made the banks billions in profit over the past decade, but regulatory rules now require them to set aside much greater amounts of capital as a buffer against potential losses on this risky business - an expensive proposition for the lenders.
At the same time, dozens of senior dealers have been suspended, fired or in other ways seen their careers grind to a halt as a result of allegations of market-rigging which have so far cost the banks around $10 billion in fines.
Unlike Graham, many dealers have moved to hedge funds or other alternative ""market-making"" houses which are trying to fill the gap left as the banks retreated more to the lower-risk business of dealing on behalf of clients.
Evidence suggests that at their new homes, the dealers - known as ""voice"" traders to distinguish them from ""black box"" computer trading programs - have struggled to deliver profits, undermining the flow of capital and credit into foreign exchange investments.
Macro hedge funds, which invest most directly in currencies, have failed to turn a profit in four of the past five years. Europe's biggest such fund, Brevan Howard, is in its third year of negative performance
""You do hear this from the funds: that voice trading has not worked out,"" says Alex McDonald, the head of London's Wholesale Market Brokers Association. 
""The options market is the place for the hedge funds but they need liquidity to be there and they do not have the banks on the other side because they (the banks) are no longer running the same size of options books.""
Graham put it more simply: ""All these guys who had strategies for making money as bank spot traders have had to go somewhere else. But it is not clear whether they know how to make money as a hedge fund.""
GEEKS
While the old school struggles, the new school of programmers and mathematicians who build complicated computer models and algorithms have already turned a majority of all currency deals electronic. 
The industry data shows machine-driven systematic macro funds which apply such strategies have racked up a 5.2 percent return since January. 
This has brought with it a new set of headaches, however. 
Computer traders want access to the ultra-competitive prices, in the form of narrow spreads between buy and sell rates, of the bank-to-bank trading market. Lenders therefore built a series of ""prime-broking"" businesses that provided their fund clients with credit and trading infrastructure.
However, a number of computer funds were badly caught out last year when the Swiss National Bank (SNB) abruptly ended a cap on the franc, and the currency shot up.
Worried about the risk of providing credit through the prime-broking system, several major banks have abandoned the practice, while others are demanding that clients hold more capital and have put prices up by as much as 30-40 percent. 
A handful of non-bank players, including U.S.-based broker FXCM and Dubai-based ADS Securities as well as fellow new entrant Saxobank of Denmark, have emerged to fill the gap, but the net amount of credit available to speculative traders still seems to have fallen.
""This is an evolution which has been going on for a long time now,"" says David Newns, managing director of Currenex, one of the biggest of the wholesale platforms that facilitate brokers, clients and banks in doing business with each other.
""It is no secret that after the SNB last year banks had a long hard look at the franchises. But we still need to have a structure that supports credit-intermediation. The question is what that finally becomes.""
CAPITAL LYING AROUND
Transaction costs will also rise for non-speculative participants such as pension funds and companies - which also need to make big currency trades to run their day-to-day business - without a deep and diverse foreign exchange market.
Further automation may help to keep the banks' dealing costs down but unless they can pass on the higher cost of capital to their clients, growth in the currency business is at risk, said the head of prime broking at one of the foreign exchange (FX) market's top 10 banks.
""There are innovative things you can do with the technology and more programing. But for now clients aren't paying enough for the capital they are using. Capital requirements (for banks) have gone up 20 times compared to three years ago but pricing for most clients is up by at most a third.""
Still, in an era when central banks have been flooding financial systems with cash via quantitative easing, the currency market ought to be able to overcome its problems.

""You would have to imagine there would be capital lying around in this environment which could be put to work in FX,"" said McDonald. ""But whether or how that will happen we don't know.""

The index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose as much as 0.40% on Friday before ending the U.S. afternoon session at 94.48, up 0.0029 on the day. With the sharp gains, the index is on pace to end a five-day losing streak. The index has plummeted more than 2.15% over the last month and has fallen by more than 4.3% since the start of the year.
Foreign exchange traders could be bracing for a period of cautious, sideways trading next week, ahead of Fed chair Janet Yellen's appearance at a closely-watched speech next Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The comments from the Fed chair could shed light on the U.S. central bank's opaque long-term monetary policy forecast, which has been clouded by diverging views from participants over the last few weeks on the timing of its next rate hike. When the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting were released on Wednesday, some participants felt that it could be appropriate to raise short-term rates in the coming months, while others were more hesitant due to below target inflation. The FOMC's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at a range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of their five meetings in 2016.
On Friday, Federal Reserve of Dallas president Rob Kaplan said the Fed's decision could be complicated by a low neutral rate, which takes into account the Federal Funds Rate minus a measure of inflation. Kaplan's comments counter a hawkish position laid out by San Francisco Fed president John Williams on Thursday, who warned that delaying an interest rate hike could have detrimental effects for the economy. Earlier this week, New York Fed president William Dudley said the timing could be right to consider raising interest rates again, while St. Louis Fed president James Bullard reiterated a previous stance that the Fed may only need to approve a single rate hike of 25 basis points over the next three years. Skeptical of a possible head-fake from the Fed, numerous market players have shrugged off the hawkish minutes this week.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, Downing Street officials said Friday that Britain prime minister Theresa May will not trigger formal proceedings to leave the European Union until at least the start of 2017. GBP/USD fell more than 0.70% to 1.3076.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2016 03:23PM ET</span>",Dollar rebounds after Fed's Williams adds support for rate hike,"By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rebounded from nearly eight-week lows against the euro and Swiss franc on Friday a day after a top Federal Reserve official joined a growing chorus signaling support for a U.S. interest rate hike in coming months.
San Francisco Fed President John Williams on Thursday said that, if the U.S. central bank waited too long to raise rates, it could be costly for the economy and that a possible rate hike in September should be in play. 
Those comments added to statements perceived as hawkish from New York Fed President William Dudley and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart in recent days. They also came after an essay Williams published this week calling for a recalibration of the Fed's long-term goals, which had fueled some speculation that the Fed would not raise rates this year.
""Williams's yesterday reversed people’s interpretation of his comments earlier in the week,"" said Ian Gordon, FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York. ""It increased the implied probability of hikes."" 
While the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last up 0.37 percent at 94.508 (DXY), it remained on track for a 1.3 percent decline for the week given the earlier skepticism over a 2016 Fed rate hike. That would mark its second straight week of losses. 
Federal funds futures on Friday suggested traders saw a 53.5 percent chance of a Fed rate hike this year, according to CME Group's FedWatch program. Investors were also awaiting the Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming next week. 
Analysts also said traders were likely taking profits on short bets against the dollar on nervousness about having bets against the U.S. currency ahead of the weekend.
""The dollar had taken a pretty big tumble in the first part of this week, so people had gotten short the dollar and now they're just buying back,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
The euro was last down 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.1319 <EUR=>, below a nearly eight-week high of $1.1365 touched Thursday. The dollar was up 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.9599 franc  after hitting a low of 0.9532 Thursday. 

Against the yen, the dollar was last up 0.36 percent at 100.22 yen <JPY=>, but was set for its fourth straight week of losses against the yen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit its lowest level against the euro in nearly eight weeks and an eight-week low against the Swiss franc on Thursday, a day after minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting showed a bias among policymakers against raising interest rates soon.
The minutes showed members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee were generally upbeat about the U.S. economic outlook. Several Fed policymakers, however, said a slowdown in the future pace of hiring would argue against a near-term hike, and FOMC members said they wanted to ""leave their policy options open.""
The minutes disappointed those expecting that the Fed could be turning more hawkish. Those expectations had been bolstered by comments from New York Fed chief William Dudley on Tuesday, who said the central bank could possibly raise rates as soon as September. 
Dudley on Thursday reinforced his message on the broader economy being on track. While the dollar initially pared losses, it soon shrugged off the remarks and extended losses in the afternoon trading session. 
""(Dudley) said his views haven't changed, but at this point, I think the market has sort of bought back into the dovish Fed story,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
The euro  hit a session high of $1.1356 and the dollar touched a session low against the franc of 0.9540 franc . The dollar also slipped to 99.66 yen earlier, a hair above Tuesday's more than seven-week low of 99.53 yen .

Federal funds futures on Thursday implied traders saw a 48.8 percent chance of a Fed rate hike this year, according to data from CME Group's FedWatch program. 
Analysts said the FOMC minutes have had the biggest impact on the dollar, compared with recent Fed policymakers' comments. 
""When we did not receive the unambiguous hawkishness from the FOMC minutes, that kind of opened up the door to additional (dollar) selling,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.

The euro was last up 0.56 percent against the dollar at $1.1350. The dollar was down 0.79 percent against the franc at 0.9538 franc  and was down 0.29 percent against the yen at 99.95 yen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar erased early gains and edged lower against the euro, yen and Swiss franc on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting showed general agreement that more data was needed before the next rate increase from the central bank. 
The minutes showed that members of the U.S. central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee were generally upbeat about the U.S. economic outlook and labor market, but several said a slowdown in the future pace of hiring would argue against a near-term hike.
Analysts said the minutes disappointed traders who expected the Fed to take a more hawkish tone. Those expectations were bolstered Tuesday, when New York Fed President William Dudley and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart signaled a potential rate increase before the end of the year.
""Some investors got the feeling maybe, maybe wrongly, that the minutes were going to confirm the view of Dudley and Lockhart yesterday that September is possible for a rate hike,"" said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Ltd in New York. 
""Maybe there is a little bit of disappointment because of that.""

""These minutes don’t support an interest rate increase sooner rather than later, and therefore I think the dollar is going to continue to falter a bit,"" said Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets in St. Louis.
Federal funds futures for December delivery implied traders saw a 47 percent chance of a rate hike in December, down from 58 percent before the release of the minutes, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit its lowest levels in more than seven weeks against the euro, yen and Swiss franc on Tuesday a day after dovish comments from a top Federal Reserve official, but pared losses after remarks from the head of the New York Fed raised expectations for a rate hike this year. 
The dollar hit its lowest levels against those three currencies since June 24, or the day after Britain voted to exit the European Union, which caused tumult in global markets. 
The euro  rose more than one percent against the dollar to a session high of $1.1322, while the dollar fell more than 1.5 percent against the yen  to 99.56 yen and more than 1 percent against the Swiss franc  to 0.9589 franc. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, also fell more than 1 percent to its lowest in more than seven weeks at 94.426. 
Analysts attributed the dollar's weakness to comments from San Francisco Fed President John Williams on Monday afternoon. Williams said the Fed should consider setting higher inflation targets. The Fed currently targets a 2-percent inflation goal.
Data showing U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in July, marking the weakest reading since February, also reinforced skepticism that the Fed would hike rates by December.
""The net takeaway is that the Fed may be so concerned about the long-term robustness of the economy and therefore, rate hikes are going to be slow,"" said Steven Englander, global head of foreign exchange strategy at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The dollar pared losses immediately following the CPI data, however, after New York Fed President William Dudley told Fox Business Network that the U.S. central bank could possibly raise rates as soon as September.
After Dudley's comments, Federal funds futures prices suggested traders saw a 55 percent chance the Fed would raise rates at its December meeting, compared with an implied 42 percent probability on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.
""Many still believe the Fed has a chance to hike later in the year,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago. ""Dudley said that later in the day, and that’s what gave us a little bit of a reversal.”

The euro was last up 0.72 percent against the dollar at $1.1263, while the dollar was last down 0.80 percent against the yen at 100.43 yen.

The upbeat outlook contradicted previous expectations for further rate cuts by the RBA. At the beginning of the month, the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 1.5%.
NZD/USD advanced 0.65% to trade at 0.7262.
Meanwhile, the greenback remained under broad selling pressure after a recent string of disappointing U.S. economic reports fueled concerns over the strength of the economy and dampened expectations for a rate hike before the end of the year.

Japan reported second quarter GDP with a gain of 0.2% year-on-year, missing the 0.7% rise seen, and a flat quarter-on-quarter pace, below the 0.2% increase expected, with the figures weighed down by sluggish private consumption and net exports.
""There are some positive signs in capital investment but we need to watch the developments because corporate profits are being flat now in light of the appreciation of the yen,"" a senior Cabinet Office official said after the data.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about 60% of the GDP, rose 0.2% on quarter compared to a 0.1% decline seen, but that did little to lift spirits.
""Private consumption remains largely flat. Our assessment is unchanged,"" the official said.
To boost growth Japan earlier this year put together an economic stimulus package totaling ¥28.1 trillion, which includes ¥7.5 trillion in real fiscal spending over the next few years, in order to overcome years of deflation and raise the economy's near-zero growth potential.
The government estimates the budgetary measures in the package totaling Y7.5 trillion will push up the scale of real gross domestic product by about 1.3% in primary stimulative effects in a period for the rest of fiscal 2016 and the whole of fiscal 2017 ending in March 2018.

1191,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2016 06:18PM ET</span>","U.S. Dollar Index moves lower, as weak data hurts rate hike chances","Investing.com -- The U.S. Dollar Index fell sharply against its main rivals on Friday as a weak batch of domestic economic data lowered the probability that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates before the end of the year, applying significant downside pressure on the greenback. 
The Index, which measures the strength of the dollar versus a basket of six other currencies, fell more than 0.30% to an intraday low of 95.19. Following a four-day winning streak through Monday's session the index ended the week with losses in three of the last four sessions. Since hitting four-month highs in late-July at 97.62, the index has plunged approximately 2%. 
On Friday morning, the U.S. Bureau of the Census said that retail sales were unchanged in July on a monthly basis, falling sharply below expectations for a 0.4% gain. The pace of consumer spending slowed in July, one month after sales soared by 0.6% for the period. Purchases across numerous categories largely dried up for the second month of the summer with the exception of auto sales which jumped by 1.1%. As a result, retail sales minus auto purchases dipped by 0.3% for July, marking its first decline since March.
Separately, the University of Michigan's flash Consumer Sentiment Index for August came in relatively flat at 90.4, finishing under analysts' forecasts of a 1.0 gain to 91.0. Weakness was seen in Current Conditions which plunged by 2.9 points for the period to 106.1. At the same time, the Expectations component jumped 3.5% to 80.3, reflecting rising confidence in the near-term jobs outlook throughout the U.S.
Earlier, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said its  Producer Price Index for Final Demand (PPI-FD) retreated by 0.4% in July, defying expectations from analysts of a slight 0.1% gain, The subdued reading halted any momentum gained from a stellar report in June when the PPI-FD soared by 0.5%. Core PPI-FD, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also fell by 0.3%. The sluggish inflation data could provide ammunition for dovish members of the Federal Reserve in their arguments for a delayed interest rate hike.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are generally viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
EUR/USD gained more than 0.25% to hit an intraday high at 1.1221, its highest level in two weeks. Officials from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany said Friday that GDP for the three-month period through June rose by 0.4%, providing indications that the euro zone's largest economy could be well-positioned to contain the damage from U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union.
The Dollar also fell sharply by 0.69% to 101.26 against the Yen, erasing gains from the prior session. A preliminary reading of second quarter GDP growth in Japan came in at 0.5%, in line with consensus estimates. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell five basis points to 1.51%. While treasury yields on U.S. 10-year notes are virtually flat over the last month, they are still down 63 basis points since this time last year.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2016 03:11PM ET</span>",Dollar dips as retail sales data stokes growth concerns,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened on Friday after U.S. retail sales were unexpectedly flat in July, while producer prices also fell in the same month, contrary to expectations, raising concerns about the strength of third-quarter economic growth.
Economists had forecast overall retail sales to rise 0.4 percent. The drop in producer prices, meanwhile, was the first since March and the largest since September 2015.
“The U.S. retail sales data in particular is causing the dollar to weaken,” said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York, adding that ""producer prices are also signaling limited inflation.""
A third report on Friday showed consumer sentiment stable in early August, though households' views on income softened a bit. A fourth report showed businesses made significant progress in June in reducing an inventory overhang that has weighed on economic growth since the second quarter of 2015. 
The dollar fell 0.15 percent against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) to 95.725, after falling as low as 95.254, the lowest in a week. The greenback also tumbled 0.77 percent against the yen <JPY=> to 101.19 yen and 0.20 percent against the euro <EUR=> to $1.1159.
The dollar had rallied last Friday on data showing employers added more jobs than expected in July, raising expectations the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates this year.
It gave up those gains this week, however, as investors see a rate hike in September as a long shot and with the Fed’s December meeting still far away.
The Fed will release minutes from its July meeting next Wednesday, with the focus then likely to turn to Chair Janet Yellen’s speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium on Aug. 26.
Antipodean currencies ended lower after briefly turning positive on the U.S. data. They fell overnight after data showed China’s economic activity slowed in July, with investment growing at its slowest pace since the turn of the century.
The weaker-than-expected Chinese data covered investment, lending, retail spending and factory output.
The Australian dollar  fell 0.65 percent against the greenback to $0.7645. The New Zealand dollar  dropped 0.18 percent to $0.7189.

The kiwi and Australian dollar were buoyed earlier this week by investors reaching for yields as European and Japanese bond yields offer, in many cases, negative returns.

The Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.30% on Thursday to an intraday high of 95.90 remaining near 1-week highs. Historically, August is considered to be bullish for the dollar as the aggregate tracker of the dollar has gained an average of 32 basis points per month, according to seasonality trends compiled by DailyFx.com. Since opening the month at 95.49, the dollar is on track for its sixth winning session over the first nine days of trading while edging up by roughly 0.43%. The Dollar Index has closed higher for the month in each of the last two years.
The dollar posted marginal gains on Thursday, even as labor market indicators remained strong on the heels of last week's robust July employment report. Last week, initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell by 1,000 to 266,000 for the week ending on August 5, lingering near historic lows. The four-week moving average, meanwhile, inched up by 3,500 to 262,750, demonstrating little change from recent reports.
Market players also reacted to optimistic quarterly results from Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) on Thursday ahead of the release of July's closely-watched retail sales report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Shares in  Macy's soared as much as 15%, after the major department store reported a lower than expected decline in same-store sales in the second quarter and outlined a plan to close 100 stores in a massive turnaround initiative. On Friday, the Census Bureau is expected to report an increase of 0.4% in retail sales last month, following a gain of 0.6% in June. Additionally, the University of Michigan could report a slight uptick in consumer sentiment in July in the wake of a sharp decline of 3.5 points a month earlier.
In February, the National Retail Federation estimated that retail sales (excluding automobile, gas and restaurant purchases) will rise 3.1% for 2016. Over the last decade, the 10-year average came in at annual growth of 2.7%.
The Federal Reserve continues to closely monitor incoming economic data, as it weighs a decision in September on the timing of its next interest rate hike. While FOMC members appear split on whether to raise short-term interest rates at a meeting next month, San Francisco Fed president John Williams told the Washington Post in an interview published on Thursday that the U.S. central bank should hike rates further this year, amid continuing labor market strength and signs that inflation is firming.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a record-low of 2% on Thursday in an effort to stave off deflation, following a move by the Reserve Bank of Australia to lower rates to an all-time low of 1.5% earlier this month. Both the Australian Dollar and the Kiwi, however, inched up against the Dollar to near 1-month highs, after the RBNZ provided few hints that further rate cuts could be forthcoming. USD/MXN plunged 1.01% to a fresh two-month low at 18.1574 after Mexico's Central Bank held rates steady, citing concerns with the U.S. presidential election.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year surged six basis points to 1.56%, as investors digested a subdued auction from the previous session. Although yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries are down 58 basis points in the last year, they have rallied 13 BPs over the last month."

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2016 04:30AM ET</span>",Kiwi hits 1-year high after RBNZ rate cut falls short of expectations,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar surged to its highest level in more than a year on Thursday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand made smaller interest rate cuts than some had expected, forcing them to unwind their bets on more aggressive easing.
The RBNZ said a higher exchange rate was driving it to lower rates and that it saw potential for one more rate cut by year end and then another by mid-2017. Traders said that was too slow relative to expectations with some going into Thursday's meeting expecting a 50 basis point cut.
As a result, the New Zealand dollar rose to $0.7351, its highest level since May 2015, before settling back a tad to $0.7275 , up 1.2 percent on the day.
The RBNZ cut interest rates a quarter point to a record low of 2.0 percent on Thursday and flagged the need for more as it struggles to head off deflation risks.
""The RBNZ has made it clear for a long time that it wants to see the kiwi to depreciate, sometimes less and sometimes more explicitly,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""Only that it does not deliver enough to achieve this.""
Along with the Australian dollar, the kiwi has been buoyed by the allure of its relatively high bond yields. New Zealand dollar 10-year government bonds (NZ10YT=RR) have a yield of around 2.1 percent, compared with negative yields in Japan and Germany.
Currency markets broader focus remained on whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year, with investors looking ahead for clues from Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Aug. 26 at the U.S. central bank's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
""A Fed rate hike still seems like a long-term prospect in the current markets and we would expect that the carry seeking behavior will continue to support the Antipodean currencies,"" analysts at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) said in a note, referring to the Australian and New Zealand dollars. 
The dollar index, which measures its value against a basket of six major currencies, last traded at 95.665 (DXY), holding within sight of a near one-week low of 95.442 set on Wednesday.
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.1165 .
Against the yen, the dollar was slightly weaker at 101.20 yen  in holiday-thinned trade, with Japanese markets closed on Thursday for a public holiday.

The greenback had risen to as high as 102.66 yen on Monday, in the wake of last Friday's strong U.S. jobs data, but has since lost momentum after weak productivity report meant inflation pressures are likely to be tame and the Federal Reserve will not rush into raising rates this year.

At the same time, the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed there were 5.1 million hires in June, an increase of 1.7%, offset slightly by 2.9 million quits on the month. The mild increase in monthly job openings was driven by an increase in job postings in the durable goods manufacturing sector.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on Wednesday as investors re-evaluated whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year, which also sent the higher-yielding Australian dollar to its loftiest level since late April.
The U.S. dollar sagged against the euro and the yen after downbeat productivity data sapped some of the momentum it had gained from last week's robust jobs report. 
U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) fell after the productivity report suggested the economy may not be growing as quickly as anticipated, prompting investors to cut long-term inflation expectations. According to CME's Fedwatch, investors have trimmed chances of a rate rise in December 2016. [L1N1AQ0EN] 
The dollar was down 0.6 percent at 101.28 yen , having gone as high as 102.66 on Monday on the strong non-farm payrolls data. The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.1173 , touching a 5-day high of $1.1184.
The dollar index (DXY) dropped 0.6 percent to 95.577. 
""The release of the third consecutive decline in quarterly U.S. productivity – the worst run since at least 1980 – does not bode well for the prospects for the dollar,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) head of currency strategy, Hans Redeker, said.
The Australian dollar advanced to a more than three-month peak of $0.7729 , buoyed this week by Australia's relatively high yields and stronger investor appetite for risk.
""Part of the Australian dollar's resilience is the lack of follow-through in pricing for a Fed hike in September, limiting the U.S. dollar's gains,"" analysts at Westpac said in a note. They recommended investors to buy the Australian dollar. 
The U.S. dollar's weakness also gave struggling sterling a lift. The pound was up 0.5 percent at $1.3061 , recovering from $1.2956 struck on Tuesday, its lowest since July 11.
The pound took a knock on Tuesday after Bank of England policymaker Ian McCafferty said more monetary easing was likely to be needed if the UK's economic decline worsened.
In European trade, attention briefly turned to the Norwegian crown. The crown scaled its highest against the euro in more than a month, after inflation rose more than expected in July, sapping expectations of interest rate cuts in the near term from the Norges Bank.
Data showed July core inflation rose to 3.7 percent from a year ago, beating expectations of a 3.1 percent rise. For the month, core inflation rose 0.7 percent.
The euro fell 0.8 percent to 9.2575 crowns (EURNOK=D4), its lowest since July 5, and down from around 9.33 beforehand.

Earlier, Nordea Markets said the Norwegian policy rate had bottomed out at 0.50 percent and the central bank was no longer expected to cut rates in September.

1223,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2016 06:22PM ET</span>","GBP/USD falls to near 1-month lows, as BOE launches bond buying program","Investing.com -- GBP/USD fell for a fifth consecutive session crashing below 1.30 for the first time in nearly a month, as the Bank of England fell short of its target to buy more than a billion Pounds of long-term debt on Tuesday, as it resumed a comprehensive Quantitative Easing program in its first attempts to manage the fall-out from June's historic Brexit decision.
The currency pair traded between 1.2957 and 1.3032, before closing the U.S. afternoon session at 1.2997, down 0.32%. The British Pound has now erased all of its gains from last Tuesday's session when it surged more than 1.5% to an intraday high of 1.3366, its highest level in more than two weeks. The Pound Sterling is now approaching 31-year lows from early-July when it fell to 1.2796 in the wake of the historic Brexit referendum.
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.2796, the low from July 6 and was met with resistance at 1.3481, the high from July 15.
During Tuesday's reverse auction in London, investors offered 1.18 billion Pounds of long-dated sovereign bonds with maturities over 15 years, far short of the BOE's targeted goal of 1.170 billion. The effort marked the BOE's first attempt to purchase long-term debt following last Thursday's decision to approve a new package of easing measures, which will infuse an additional £60 billion of cash into the U.K. through the purchase of government bonds. The BOE said it will announce a plan to account for the shortfall on Wednesday morning, Reuters reported.
Consequently, yields on the UK 10-Year fell more than five basis points to an intraday-low of 0.563% its lowest level on record. The spread between the U.S. 10-Year and 10-year U.K. Gilts remains near all-time highs after yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries closed at 1.55% on Tuesday, up 19 basis points for the month. Elsewhere, the Pound came under further downside pressure from soft factory data after reports showed that U.K. manufacturing data decreased by 0.3% last month, falling at a sharper rate than analysts' forecasts for a 0.2% decline.
Meanwhile, investors continued to stake their bets on a 2016 rate hike from the Federal Reserve as they digest a robust monthly U.S. jobs report from late last week. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the probability of a December rate hike at approximately 50% on Tuesday, considerably above odds of around 30% before the report was released. The CME Group has also increased the chances of a September rate hike to around 20%, up from 10% last week.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.20% to an intraday low of 96.02. The index is virtually flat over the last month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar weakened on Tuesday as investors evaluated the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year, with no major new economic indicators due until Friday's retail sales report.
The greenback had gained since last Friday's jobs report for July showed better-than-expected employment gains, raising expectations that a further rate increase this year is likely.
It gave back some of those gains on Tuesday on no obvious catalyst, with trading volumes expected to be relatively light this week with many traders and investors on summer vacations.
A speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen at the central bank's Aug. 26 symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming will be closely watched for any new indications of when an interest rate increase is likely.
""I think the risks are tilted towards a less dovish sounding narrative from Chair Yellen,"" said Richard Franulovich, a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corporation in New York.
""Financial conditions remain very buoyant post Brexit and the Fed will breathe a huge sigh of relief that we now have two back-to-back strong payrolls numbers,"" he said, referring to Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.
The dollar index (DXY) against a basket of currencies fell 0.24 percent to 96.174. The greenback was 0.53 percent weaker against the Japanese yen at 101.88. 
The yen extended gains against the dollar on Tuesday after data showed that U.S. nonfarm productivity unexpectedly fell in the second quarter.
The British pound fell for the fifth day in a row on Tuesday after a Bank of England policymaker said that more quantitative easing was probably necessary if Britain's economic decline worsens.
""Bank rate can be cut further, closer to zero, and quantitative easing can be stepped up,"" Ian McCafferty, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, wrote in an op-ed piece for the Times.
The pound  was last down 0.30 percent at $1.2999, after earlier dropping to $1.2957, its lowest since July 11. 
The Bank of England last week cut interest rates to next to nothing and unleashed billions of pounds of stimulus to cushion the economic shock from Britain's vote to leave the EU.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to be the next central bank to ease conditions, by cutting rates on Thursday by 25 basis points to 2.00 percent.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1072 and 1.1105 before closing the U.S. afternoon session at 1.1084, down 0.03% on the day. The euro is on pace for its fourth winning session versus the U.S. Dollar over the last five trading days. Since voters in the U.K. decided to leave the European Union in a historic referendum on June 24, the pair has remained squarely in a tight range between 1.0950 and 1.1236. During that span, the euro is down fractionally by 0.30% versus its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0959, the low from July 27 and was met with resistance at 1.1233, the high from August 3.
The labor market added 255,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, continuing its rebound from a weak period in May when the U.S. economy only added 24,000 jobs for the month. As the labor market has shown broad signs of improvement in recent months, the odds of a Fed rate hike in the coming months have grown considerably. Notably, hiring in the lagging construction industry picked up at a higher clip in July by 14,000 for the month, even as job gains in the mining sector remained weak. At the same time, jobs in the temporary help category rose by 17,000, providing indications that large pockets of part-time workers could be on the verge of being hired on a full-time basis. Economists also appear to be encouraged by a spike of 0.3% in average hourly wages, which are now up by 2.6% over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stayed flat at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate inched up by 0.1% to 62.8%.
On Monday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the odds of a September rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at 18.0%, up sharply from 9% in last Thursday's session prior to the release. The probability of a December rate hike from the FOMC also increased to 40%, up from 29.4% in the middle of last week. The FOMC has held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its first five meetings this year. Last December, the U.S. central bank halted a seven-year Zero Interest Rate Policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, a high court in Italy ruled on Monday that Matteo Renzi can proceed with a referendum on a package of constitutional amendments that could lead to the prime minister's resignation if the measures are defeated. As national polls depict a voter base largely split on the extensive constitutional changes, Renzi's government is expected to schedule a referendum date for sometime between October and December. Much like June's Brexit decision, the vote could wind up having widespread ramifications for future trade policies in Europe.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.20% to an intraday high of 96.42. The index is still down by more than 1% since hitting four-month highs of 97.62 in late-July. "
1235,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2016 03:20PM ET</span>",Dollar gains as strong jobs data boosts Fed hike bets,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained against a basket of currencies on Monday after a stronger-than-anticipated jobs report for July on Friday raised expectations that the Federal Reserve is closer to raising interest rates.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 jobs in July, more than the Reuters forecast of 180,000 for the month, and wages picked up, with hiring broadly based across the sectors of the economy.
The data helped offset concerns about sluggish economic indicators, including preliminary estimates of weak gross domestic product for the second quarter, released in late July.
""Friday’s employment report was extremely strong and I think that’s hardened the conviction of investors who view the U.S. economy as strongly outperforming other countries,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, gained 0.21 percent to 96.293. The dollar was up 0.62 percent against the Japanese yen at 102.44.
Higher yielding currencies also gained on Monday as investors looked for higher returns. The Australian dollar gained 0.38 percent against the greenback to $0.7652.
Trading this week is expected to be relatively light, with many traders and investors on summer vacations. Friday’s retail sales report for July will be the next major U.S. economic focus.
A speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen at the central bank's symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 26 is also anticipated for any new indications on when an interest rate increase may be likely.
Most economists and investors see a U.S. rate hike as most likely in December, and believe the Fed will be hesitant to act before the U.S. presidential election in November.
“(Payrolls) supported the growth outlook on the U.S. side but doesn’t really move the needle that much on a September rate hike,” said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.
The Fed stands apart from central banks from Japan to Europe, which have been easing as they attempt to stimulate growth and stave off deflation.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is likely to be the next central bank to ease conditions on Thursday, when it is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points to 2.00 percent.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2016 11:10PM ET</span>",China's July forex reserves fall to $3.20 trillion,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves fell to $3.20 trillion in July, central bank data showed on Sunday, in line with analyst expectations.
Economists polled by Reuters had predicted reserves would fall to $3.20 trillion from $3.21 trillion at the end of June.
China's reserves, the largest in the world, fell by $4.10 billion in July. The reserves rose $13.4 billion in June, rebounding from a 5-year low in May.
China's gold reserves rose to $78.89 billion at the end of July, up from $77.43 billion at end-June, data published on the People's Bank of China website showed.
Net foreign exchange sales by the People's Bank of China in June jumped to their highest in three months, as the central bank sought to shield the yuan from market volatility caused by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
China's foreign exchange regulator recently said China would be able to keep cross-border capital flows steady given its relatively sound economic fundamentals, solid current account surplus and ample foreign exchange reserves.
China's foreign reserves fell by a record $513 billion last year after it devalued the yuan currency in August, sparking a flood of capital outflows that alarmed global markets.
The yuan has eased another 2 percent this year and is hovering near six-year lows, but official data suggests speculative capital flight is under control for now, thanks to tighter capital controls and currency trading regulations. 
However, economists are divided over how much money is still flowing out of the country via other channels, with opaque policymaking and some inconsistency in the data raising suspicions that the fall in the yuan may be masking capital outflow pressure.
After the yuan slipped to below the psychologically important 6.7/dollar level on July 18, it has seen a mild rebound as the central bank stepped in to control the pace of its depreciation. 
Still, most China watchers expect it will resume its descent soon, risking a renewed surge in outflows.
A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed analysts believe the yuan may fall more than 3 percent against the dollar by a year from now, more than expected just a month ago, as the economy struggles to maintain momentum and as the dollar edges up on views of an eventual U.S. rate rise.
China will keep the yuan basically stable and continue with market-based interest rate reform, the central bank said on Wednesday.

The country's economy expanded slightly faster than expected in the second quarter but private investment growth shrank to a record low, suggesting future weakness that could pressure the government to roll out more support measures.

It came one day after the British Pound fell by more than 1.5% versus its American counterpart, following the Bank of England's decision to cut its benchmark rate to a record-low of 0.25% and implement a host of easing measures. In Friday's session, the Pound Sterling closed below 1.31 against the Dollar for the first time since July 11.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said in its monthly employment report that the economy added 255,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, topping the high end of analysts' expectations by 70,000 and erasing lingering concerns that June's robust report may have been a fluke. Adding further optimism to July's reading, the labor participation rate ticked up by 0.1 to 62.8% while the unemployment rate remained flat at 4.9%.
Within the report, the gains were driven by increases in professional & business services and temporary help, which rose by 70,000 and 17,000 respectively. Hiring in the construction and retail industries, which have lagged throughout the year, also picked up last month each adding at least 14,000. Meanwhile, employment in government and financial activities edged up, offset slightly by declines in the mining sector. Notably, average hourly wages surged by 0.3% in July and are now up by 2.6% over the last year. For the month, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by seven cents to $21.59. Analysts expected to see a 0.3% increase in average hourly earnings, one month after wages inched up by 0.1% in June.
Following the release, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the odds of a September rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at 18%, up considerably from 9% over the previous session. The chances of a December rate hike from the FOMC also increased to 39.7% on Friday, up from 29.4% a day earlier. There is also a 6.7% chance the FOMC will approve two rate hikes of 25 basis points each before the end of the year, the CME Group added. Earlier this week, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans said it could be appropriate to raise rates once this year if economic conditions continued to improve, while Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart failed to take a September rate hike off the table.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the Dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, Sterling net short contracts surged to 82,515 this week, hitting a fresh record-high, according to data released by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission on Friday. Net long positions in the dollar fell by more than $750 million to $12.81 billion for the period ending on Aug. 2, the CFTC said. GBP/USD has slid more than 12% since voters in the U.K. decided to leave the European Union in a historic referendum on June 24.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 96.50, before falling back to 96.19 at the end of the U.S. afternoon session. The index is still down by more than 1% since hitting four-month highs of 97.62 early last week."

(Reuters) - Speculators pared back bullish U.S. dollar bets this week, as investors were dismayed by poor U.S. economic growth data for the second quarter that dampened expectations for an interest rate hike this year.
The value of the dollar's net long position fell to $12.81 billion in the week ended Aug. 2, from $13.66 billion the previous week, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.
Dollar net longs fell after increasing four straight weeks. The greenback had been on its best run of weekly gains in 1-1/2 years until last week when the weak GDP data was released.
Since that GDP report, the dollar had weakened 1.4 percent, before recovering on Friday after a much stronger-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls number.
Analysts say it would be hard for the Federal Reserve to ignore two straight month of strong jobs numbers. That view should drive further gains in the dollar.
""It has now become rather clear that employment remains a very substantial bright spot in the U.S. economy and a strong support factor for a potential rate hike this year,"" said James Chen, currency strategist at Forex.com in New Jersey. 
Sterling net short contracts, meanwhile, surged to 82,515, a record high, data showed.
Net short contracts on the British pound grew at a rapid pace after Britain voted on June 23 to leave the European Union. Speculators have been short sterling since November last year.
Since Britain's vote, the pound has fallen 13.31 percent.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2016 03:06PM ET</span>",Dollar rebounds after robust U.S. jobs report,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rallied across the board on Friday after data showed U.S. employment increased more than expected in July and wages picked up, raising the probability of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this year.
The dollar hit one-week peaks against the euro and the Swiss franc, and turned positive versus the yen after the jobs data.
U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 255,000 jobs last month, after an upwardly revised 292,000 surge in June. Economists polled by Reuters forecast an increase of 180,000 in July.
""Another constructive U.S. labor market report is a welcome development for Fed officials, with tentative signs of growing wage pressures particularly appealing to the hawks,"" said Viraj Patel, FX strategist at ING Wholesale Banking in London. 
""Moreover, today's release couldn't have come at a better time for a flailing dollar, which has been under pressure since last week's soft Q2 GDP (data),"" he added. 
After the U.S. employment report, Fed fund futures priced in an 18 percent chance the Fed will hike rates at its policy meeting next month, from 9 percent late Thursday, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. For the December meeting, futures showed a roughly 47 percent probability of a hike, compared with about 32 percent late Wednesday.
But Brian Dolan, chief of financial education and head market strategist at DriveWealth LLC in Chatham, New Jersey, believes the ""odds remain stacked"" against a Fed rate hike this year, given the struggling global economic picture.
But he noted that risk sentiment will improve with the jobs data and the dollar should stabilize after recent declines.
In late trading, the dollar index (DXY) rose 0.5 percent to 96.212, recovering from last week's poor showing when it fell 2 percent for its worst weekly performance since April. 
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.6 percent to 101.77 yen . The dollar posted it largest one-day gain in more than a week.
The greenback also hit a one-week high against the Swiss franc. The dollar was last at 0.9796 franc , up 0.6 percent. 

The euro, meanwhile, slid to a one-week low against the dollar and last traded at $1.1088 , down 0.3 percent.

Earlier Friday, data showed that German factory orders fell 0.4% in June, compared to expectations for a 0.6% rise and after an uptick of 0.1% in May.
GBP/USD retreated 0.40% to a nearly four-week low of 1.3053.
The pound had already lost ground after the Bank of England cut interest rates to a record-low 0.25% on Thursday in a bid to buffer the economy from a downturn following the Brexit vote.
The central bank also boosted its quantitative easing program by £60 billion and slashed its growth forecast for next year. It now expects growth of just 0.8% in 2017, down from 2.3% in its May forecasts.

Canada’s unemployment rate ticked up to 6.9% last month from 6.8% in June.
A separate report showed that Canada’s trade deficit widened to C$3.63 billion in June from C$3.50 billion in May, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated deficit of C$3.28 billion.
Analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow to C$2.82 billion in June.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.3102 and 1.3345, before closing the U.S. afternoon session at 1.3106, down 1.67% on the day. Despite rebounding slightly from 30-year lows in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum, the Pound is still down by nearly 12% against the Dollar since voters decided to leave the European Union on June 24. Hours before the Leave campaign prevailed in the controversial vote, the Pound surged above 1.50 versus the Dollar – peaking at six-month highs.
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.27996 the low from July 6 and was met with resistance at 1.3481, the high from July 15.
On Thursday morning, the Bank of England as expected lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a record-low of 0.25%, representing its first rate cut since the Great Recession. Notably, the BOE increased its asset purchasing by £60 billion, outlined a plan to begin buying £10 billion of corporate bonds per month and announced an initiative for providing as much as £100 billion to banks under a comprehensive term funding scheme.
""We have launched a timely, coherent and comprehensive package,"" BOE governor Mark Carney said.
At the same time, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased its near-term inflation outlook on Thursday, due primarily to the recent depreciation of the Pound Sterling. By year's end, the MPC expects inflation to reach 0.8%, up from previous estimates of 0.4%. The MPC also anticipates that inflation will increase to 1.9% by the end of 2017 and overshoot its 2% target in December, 2018. Carney emphasized that additional rate cuts and further easing measures could be forthcoming if the figures in Thursday's inflation forecast wind up being accurate.
While analysts from Fitch Ratings described the easing measures as a ""proactive policy response,"" to the EU referendum, they cautioned that the action may still be not sufficient enough to offset the shock to domestic growth brought about by the Brexit decision. Over the next two years, Fitch anticipates capital spending among British firms to decline by 15% in comparison with its May outlook.
Yields on the U.K. 10-Year tumbled 16 basis points on Thursday to an all-time record low of 0.64%. Since the final votes in the referendum were tallied in late-June, yields on U.K. gilts have plunged more than 75 basis points from their Pre-Brexit level of 1.40%.
Elsewhere, investors looked ahead to Friday's key U.S. monthly jobs report for the month of July for further indications on the strength of the labor market. Analysts expect to see an increase of 185,000 in nonfarm payrolls, one month after the economy added a robust 287,000 jobs in June. Steady increases in wages and continued declines in unemployment over the next two months could compel the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates at its next meeting in September.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.25% to an intraday high 95.87. The index is still sharply below four-month highs of 97.62 from early last week."

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2016 09:03AM ET</span>",Sterling dives as Bank of England launches 'sledgehammer' easing,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling saw its biggest falls since the aftermath of June's Brexit vote on Thursday, while other major currencies most closely correlated with global growth rose after the Bank of England launched a series of steps to support the UK economy. 
As well as cutting rates to a record-low 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent, the BoE launched two new schemes, one to buy 10 billion pounds of high-grade corporate bonds and another - potentially worth up to 100 billion pounds - to ensure banks keep lending even after the cut in interest rates.
Sterling sank 1.5 percent against the dollar in the half hour after the decision and as BoE Governor Mark Carney started speaking. 
Dutch bank ING called the package of measures ""sledgehammer stimulus"".
The Australian and New Zealand dollars, which have suffered in the past week from worries that central banks globally would not meet market expectations for further easing of policy, jumped by around half a percent against the U.S. dollar.   
""The Bank of England has hit a perfect ‘High Five’ at today’s meeting, over-delivering against market expectations and bucking the recent trend of central banks disappointing,"" said Nick Gartside, a portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management in London.
Ahead of the decision, currency traders had worried that those betting against the pound looked exposed to the risk that the Bank would deliver only a cut in interest rates. 
""By extending the quantitative easing programme over the next 6 months, and the corporate bond buying programme over the next 18 months, the MPC has indicated that it expects to be in easing mode for a good while,"" said Mike Amey, Head of Sterling Portfolios at PIMCO. 
""This has triggered new lows on UK gilt yields and pushed sterling down again. These moves are justified by what is certainly a comprehensive programme.""
Sterling money markets moved to price in further falls in the Bank's rates after it said in its statement that most of its policymakers were likely to back a cut to zero if economic data came in in line with its forecasts in the months ahead.
Expectations that the Bank would have to move aggressively to stave off a shock to investment and growth after June's vote to leave the European Union has kept sterling under pressure.
But it remains above 31-year lows around $1.28 hit a month ago. It had ground out gains against the dollar in two of the past three weeks.
By 1151 GMT, the pound was down 1.4 percent at $1.3136.  It lost 1.1 percent to 84.59 pence per euro. (EURGBP=)
The dollar, driven to a six-week low after a very poor reading of U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) last week, drew strength from the gains against sterling. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, gained 0.3 percent to 95.832 (DXY), holding above a low of 95.003 touched earlier this week.
It was flat at 101.20 yen <JPY=> but 0.25 percent stronger against the euro at $1.1122. <EUR=> 
The question after the BoE decision and some brighter ADP jobs numbers on Wednesday is whether U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday revive expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year.

U.S. interest rate futures suggest investors now see just a 40 percent chance of a Fed rate hike by December.

Hours later, BOE governor Mark Carney sent strong hints that the bank could reduce rates and introduce further easing measures at some point over the summer in order to help avert a significant economic downturn. Historically, interest rate cuts from the BOE have been associated with a sharp depreciation in the Pound.
At the Bank of England's July MPC meeting, the committee voted 8-1 to hold rates steady at a level of 0.50%.
Following the Bank of England's rate decision, market players will turn their attention to a closely-watched U.S. employment report for the month of July on Friday for a clearer picture on the state of the U.S. labor market.

In addition, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans told reporters that one rate hike this year could be appropriate if inflation continues to move closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2016 03:22PM ET</span>","Canadian dollar to weaken slightly as lower oil, sluggish growth weigh","By Fergal Smith
(Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is expected to weaken slightly against the U.S. dollar over the coming months, a Reuters poll found, with a sluggish domestic economy and lower oil prices seen weighing on the commodity-linked currency.
The poll of more than 50 foreign exchange strategists showed the currency will weaken to C$1.3200 in three months, down almost 1 percent from Tuesday's close of C$1.3102. That matches the 3-month forecast from last month's poll.
The currency has weakened nearly 5 percent since May 3 when it reached a 10-month high of C$1.2461 against its U.S. counterpart.
""We do see oil prices coming under continued pressure throughout Q3 so we think that is going to weigh on the Canadian dollar,"" said Ian Gordon, FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Canada is a major oil exporter. 
""A lot of the shock from the oil price decline that we saw from 2014 through to 2015 hasn't fully been felt yet ... the (Canadian) economy is going to continue to struggle particularly against a backdrop of a weakened export sector,"" he added.
Crude oil has tumbled more than 20 percent from its recent peak in June, dipping below $40 a barrel on Tuesday. It traded above $100 a barrel in mid-2014.
George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets, also expects soft exports and lower oil prices to weigh on the Canadian dollar, as well as ""fallout from the Alberta wildfires"" in May and June.
The Bank of Canada has said the shutdown of oil sands production facilities and the evacuation of residents during the wildfires cut about 1.1 percentage points from annualized GDP in the second quarter.
""To the extent that firmer U.S. economic data may cause the market to price in the increased probability of a Fed hike by year end, it will also lend some support to the greenback,"" Davis said.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last month left interest rates unchanged but said near-term risks to the U.S. economic outlook had diminished, opening the door to a resumption of monetary policy tightening this year.
In contrast, the Bank of Canada is expected to keep rates unchanged for at least another year given the depressed price of oil and risks to global economic growth from Britain's shock June 23 vote to leave the European Union. [CA/POLL]
A return of risk aversion would be an additional headwind for Canada's risk-sensitive currency as Brexit materializes and investors realize the limits of central bank action, said Krishen Rangasamy, senior economist at National Bank Financial.
Still, forecasters expect the Canadian dollar to recover to C$1.305 in 12 months, almost matching the previous poll's forecast, helped by a better growth profile next year.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2016 09:00AM ET</span>","Dollar to hold steady in the year ahead, risks to the downside: Reuters poll","By Shrutee Sarkar and Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - The dollar is forecast to strengthen slightly over the coming 12 months, but analysts polled by Reuters say the risks are skewed more to the downside on growing expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve may not hike interest rates at all this year.
While the Fed's upbeat tone on the economy last week left many confident a rate hike is on the way soon, weaker-than-expected economic data since then and top Fed officials urging caution have pushed back expectations yet again.
That pull-and-push after the Fed took its first baby step last December to raise rates from the zero bound has restrained the dollar (DXY) so far this year, down 3 percent in 2016 after racking up a 20 percent gain over the prior two years. 
Still, the latest poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists showed dollar gains will be slow and gradual against major currencies, apart from the British pound, and especially so in the run-up to the U.S. Presidential election in November.
""With the Fed looking like the only central bank to raise rates, what the Fed does and doesn't do is going to remain a primary consequence (for the dollar),"" said Jane Foley, senior FX analyst at Rabobank.
""But we do have the U.S. elections, and that for some months could be a crucial factor.""
While currency speculators increased their bets in favor of the U.S. dollar at the expense of the euro and sterling to the highest since February, analysts in the poll were split on where these flows would go.
But with expectations for still more easing from the ECB, the euro is forecast to weaken slightly to $1.10 in a month from $1.12 on Wednesday. It is expected to weaken further to $1.08 in three months and to $1.07 in a year.
Those findings are similar to a poll last month, but the number of analysts now calling for the euro to fall to or below parity with the dollar has decreased to just three.
For sterling, the story is worse compared to last month.
The pound's slide since Britain voted to quit the European Union is not over, and it is set to shed another 6 percent, according to foreign exchange strategists who have been very accurate about sterling's woes so far. [GBP/POLL]
But strategists are sticking to their forecasts for a weaker yen despite the Japanese currency's blistering near 20 percent rally this year.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2016 04:44AM ET</span>","Dollar struggles near six-week lows, no Fed hike seen soon","By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar inched up but stayed close to six-week lows against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, kept under pressure by the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later rather than sooner.
The greenback had been on its best run of weekly gains in 1-1/2 years until last week, when expectations that the Fed would clearly signal a near-term rate hike were disappointed, and U.S. growth data came in much weaker than expected.
The dollar index inched up 0.2 percent on Wednesday but at 95.284 (DXY) remained close to Tuesday's low of 95.003 and was down 2 percent compared with a week ago, before the Fed's policy statement.
In London, UBS Wealth Management currency strategist Geoffrey Yu said the dollar had been boosted by a risk-off mood in U.S. trading on Tuesday, when indexes suffered their worst day in a month on lower oil prices and lackluster inflation data. But he said any gains on risk-aversion would be capped. 
""We're caught in this kind of trap where every time we get nervous about something, the dollar rallies, but then the next thing to think about is: is the Fed going to react to that by pushing out their rate views?"" Yu said. ""And then you can't afford to be long dollars that aggressively any more. So that's why we have these turns, quite rapidly.""
The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 101.08 yen . It slid 1.5 percent the previous day when it fell to a three-week trough of 100.680, amid some disappointment that a meeting between Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda did not result in steps to weaken the yen.
Junichi Ishikawa, currency analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo, said it was a matter of time before the dollar breaks below 100 yen. The dollar briefly slipped below the watershed level in the stormy markets that followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June, but it has managed to stay above ever since.
""The break below 100 yen after Brexit was an irregular move. But this time, the yen is gaining steadily on fundamental factors like Japan's improving current account balance and the fading impact of BOJ's multi-dimensional easing,"" Ishikawa said.
The Japanese central bank eased monetary policy on Friday by upping the amount of its exchange-traded fund purchases, but underwhelmed the markets by holding off from increasing the amount of government bonds its buys every month.
Bitcoin was down around 10 percent compared with 12 hours previously at $543  by 0735 GMT, after a Hong Kong digital currency exchange said it had suspended trading on its exchange after almost 120,000 bitcoin - worth almost $65 million at the current rate - was stolen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar dropped to a six-week low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, pressured by expectations the Federal Reserve would delay raising interest rates after recent soft U.S. economic data.
The U.S. currency also slid to a three-week trough against the yen, as the Japanese government approved a largely expected set of stimulus measures. The dollar fell to its lowest in six weeks against the euro.
The greenback extended losses after U.S. data showed little inflation. A key inflation measure - the core personal consumption expenditure index - grew by a modest 0.1 percent in June, which kept the annual inflation rate unchanged at 0.9 percent.
On Friday, the U.S. government reported tepid gross domestic product growth for the second quarter.
""The lack of a clear pick-up in inflation will allow the Fed to delay the next rate hike until it has seen more concrete signs of a rebound in GDP growth, which all but rules out a September rate hike,"" said Steve Murphy, U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
In mid-morning trading, the dollar index fell 0.6 percent to 95.165 (DXY), after earlier sliding to 95.151, the lowest level since June 24.

Against the yen, the dollar declined 1.2 percent to 101.22 yen , after earlier touching a three-week low of 101.20 yen. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet approved 13.5 trillion yen ($132 billion) in fiscal measures on Tuesday. Instead of falling, the yen rallied because the stimulus package was in line with expectations and followed easing moves by the Bank of Japan that were perceived as less aggressive than anticipated.
""Japanese policymakers now face a serious dilemma as the (dollar/yen) pair has unwound most of the gains of the prior three weeks and now stands perilously close to the 100.00 level,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.
""Japanese authorities may be forced to once again consider intervention although prior episodes have proved futile."" 
The euro, meanwhile, rose to a six-week high against the dollar and was last up 0.5 percent at $1.1212 .
Also on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point, but the Australian dollar rallied. The Aussie currency was last up 1.2 percent at U.S. $0.7633 .

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2016 04:58AM ET</span>",Dollar crawls up after worst week in three months,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar crawled up on Monday after recording its poorest weekly performance in three months, while the yen edged lower after a more than 3 percent surge on a much less aggressive than expected easing package from the Bank of Japan.
The greenback shed 2 percent last week against a basket of major currencies (DXY) after the U.S. Federal Reserve gave no hints of any near-term interest rate rise as some had expected it to, and after a disappointing set of U.S. growth data at the end of the week. 
It could manage just a 0.2 percent rise on Monday, to 95.672, leaving it close to the 3-1/2-week low of 95.384 hit on Friday.
U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual 1.2 percent in April-June, falling far short of the 2.6 percent increase that had been forecast. But strategists said this week's data, which includes the closely watched monthly non-farm payrolls report on Friday, could boost the U.S. currency.
""We're expecting the U.S. data flow to be very supportive of U.S. yields and the dollar,"" said  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. 
""Our interpretation of the July statement from the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) was that if data continues to remain very strong then September looks well underpriced by the market,"" added Lynton-Brown.
New York Fed President William Dudley said at a central bankers' conference in Bali on Monday that the Fed could hike rates before the November U.S. election if the economy and labor market improve quickly, although he added the Fed should be cautious.
The dollar had been rallying before last week, posting five weeks of consecutive gains - its strongest run in 1-1/2 years. The weaker-than-expected GDP report followed a strong payrolls report for June, as well as improving inflation, retail sales and jobless claims data.
In response, speculators raised their bullish U.S. dollar bets to the highest level in nearly five months in the week up to last Tuesday, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.[IMM/FX]
The dollar gained half a percent on Monday to 102.54 yen , having fallen more than 3 percent on Friday. 
The BOJ disappointed market hopes that it might increase its already huge bond-buying program or take interest rates further into negative territory. Instead, it increased its purchase of exchange-traded funds and left rates unchanged. 
""Last week the BOJ showed restraint once again, and as a result dollar/yen has since eased back to 102,"" wrote Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategists in a note to clients. ""The outlook that may now be justified is likely to depend largely on fiscal policy measures the Japanese cabinet is going to decide on tomorrow.""

But the Chinese market still saw robust dollar demand, while major state banks were suspected of selling dollars on behalf of the central bank to help support the yuan, traders said. 
""Investors still believe the yuan will depreciate by the end of this year, possibly to 6.8/dollar,"" said a senior trader at a European bank in Shanghai. 
He said that ""sustained"" dollar demand in the market despite the yuan's recent rebound, while the central bank ""was suspected to be offering dollar liquidity to keep the yuan's value under its control."" 
The People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate  at 6.6277 per dollar prior to market open, firmer than the previous fix of 6.6511. The spot market  opened at 6.6340 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.6346 at midday, -55 pips away from the previous late session close and 0.10 percent away from the midpoint. 
Since the yuan slipped to the psychologically important 6.7/dollar level on July 18, it has had a mild rebound of 0.7 percent as the central bank stepped in to control the pace of its depreciation. 
The Chinese currency has still depreciated 2.2 percent so far this year, partly because of how the world's second largest economy is struggling to keep growth rates from falling.

As well, Australia said the AIG manufacturing index for July spiked to 56.4, compared with last month's figure at 51.8. The index rose further in July for the 13th month in a row and marking the longest period of expansion in over a decade.

The Fed left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and said near-term risks to the U.S. economic outlook had diminished. However, the central bank stopped short of signaling that a further increase in U.S. interest rates is on the cards for later this year.
Meanwhile, the yen rallied after the Bank of Japan approved only moderate stimulus measures at Friday's monetary policy meeting, disappointing markets which were hoping for much more aggressive easing.
While the BoJ eased its monetary policy further by increasing its purchases of exchange-traded funds, it opted not to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory or increase the monetary base, as analysts had widely expected.
The BoJ said it will conduct a thorough assessment of the effects of negative interest rates and its massive asset-buying program in September, suggesting that a major overhaul of its stimulus program may be forthcoming and reviving expectations it could adopt some form of ""helicopter money"".

The currency pair fell as much as 3.10% to an intraday low of 101.97, before rising slightly to end the U.S. afternoon session at 102.03. At session lows, the Dollar fell to its lowest level against the Japanese Yen in three weeks. Since hitting 7-week highs versus the Yen last Friday, the Dollar has tumbled 4.50% against its Japanese counterpart. More broadly, the Dollar is down by approximately 15% year-to-date. 
Citing an uncertain outlook in global financial markets and expectations for a slowdown in emerging economies stemming from last month's Brexit decision, the BOJ approved moderate stimulus measures at Friday's monetary policy meeting. While the Japanese Central Bank took some action on Friday by upping the level of ETF purchases from ¥3.3 to 6 trillion, the BOJ largely fell short of market expectations for further interest rate cuts and expanded Quantitative Easing. In a 7-2 vote, the BOJ held its deposit rate at Minus-0.1% and maintained its monetary base target at ¥80 trillion. Heading into the meeting, the BOJ came under pressure from the Japanese government to use the levers necessary to lower the Yen in order to help jumpstart soft exports.
""The Bank will continue with (QE) with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner,"" the BOJ said in a statement. ""It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and the interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target."" Earlier on Friday, the Japanese government reported that core inflation increased by 0.8% in May, far below the BOJ's targeted objective of 2%. It also came two days after prime minister Shinzo Abe unveiled a JPY 28 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, representing approximately 6% of the Japanese economy, according to Reuters.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said Friday that preliminary GDP for the second quarter rose by 1.2%, far below consensus estimates of 2.6%. Within the report, inventories nationwide fell for the first time since 2011 -- offset somewhat by robust levels of consumer spending. For the three-month period, consumer spending rose by 4.2%, more than doubling first quarter growth of 1.6%.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2016 03:57AM ET</span>",Yen surges as Bank of Japan disappoints,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen soared against the dollar on Friday after a round of modest monetary policy easing from the Bank of Japan disappointed investors who had been hoping for at least a hint of more radical stimulus.
In a month rife with speculation that Japanese authorities were readying to move towards ""helicopter money"" drops of cash to businesses and consumers, the yen has been more volatile than at any time since the 2008 financial crisis.
It surged by almost 3 percent, peak-to-trough in the 30 seconds following the Bank of Japan decision and as Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's news conference continued early in the European day, it was up almost 2 percent against both the euro and dollar. (EURJPY=) 
That still left it short of levels seen as investors flooded into the traditional security of Japan after Britain's vote to leave the European Union last month but saw a number of banks again calling the yen higher. 
""Kuroda ordered a review of the effectiveness of policy for the next meeting, which will keep easing expectations alive, but in our view not sufficiently to stop the trend of yen strength reasserting itself,"" said Adam Cole, head of G10 FX Strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London. 
The dollar last traded at 103.31 yen, down 1.9 percent, having hit a 2-1/2 week low of 102.705 yen after the announcement of the BOJ's decision. The euro was also 1.7 percent weaker at 114.59 yen. 
The BOJ announced a modest increase in purchases of ETFs, but maintained its base money target at 80 trillion yen ($775 billion) as well as the pace of purchases for other assets including Japanese government bonds.
The BOJ also kept negative interest rates unchanged at minus 0.1 percent. Many in markets had expected more cuts in rates as well as possibly more bond-buying and Japanese bond yields jumped by around 10 basis points in response. 
""The BOJ clearly disappointed by merely expanding on its ETF purchases, leaving the annual pace of its monetary base increase and policy rate unchanged,"" said Heng Koon How, senior FX investment strategist for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
""We can continue to expect elevated volatility and possible short-term risk of yen strength back towards possibly 100.""
Trading conditions in the dollar versus the yen had been very illiquid going into the BOJ's announcement, with the bid to ask spread widening to 0.40 yen at one point, although they later narrowed back to around 0.02 yen or so as trading conditions normalized. 
The market reaction to the BOJ's decision was exacerbated by a recent build up in expectations for the central bank to unveil significant monetary easing that effectively would fund the government's plans for increased fiscal spending.
""There had been pretty strong hopes for combined measures. There is strong appreciation pressure on the yen now that such hopes have dissipated,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore. 
The Japanese government unveiled a surprisingly large 28 trillion yen ($267.58 billion) stimulus package on Wednesday but sources told Reuters on Thursday that the government package contains direct fiscal spending of only 7 trillion yen, also likely to disappoint investors.

Burdened by the yen fall, the dollar was half a percent lower against a basket of its peers at 96.289 (DXY) having hit set a 2-week low at 96.216. The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.1097 .

USD/JPY traded at 103.44, down 1.74%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7540, up 0.49%. GBP/USD traded at 1.3188, up 0.18%.
The BoJ increased its buying of exchange traded funds to ¥6 trillion from ¥3.3 trillion as part of a move to ease policy further and spur the economy as downside risks to the economy remain, but held other policy levers steady.
Earlier in Japan, household spending fell 1.1% in June month-on-month, compared to an expected 0.4% gain with year-on-year showing a 2.2% drop. National CPI fell 0.4% in June year-on-year, matching expectations, while the unemployment rate dipped to 3.1% from 3.2%.
Also in Japan, industrial production rose 1.9%, much better than the 0.7% gain seen for June month-on-month and retail sales fell 1.4%, a tad slower than the 1.5% declined expected and the fourth straight monthly drop.
Australia said that PPI data for the second quarter came in at a gain of 0.1%, below the 0.2% gain seen quarter-on-quarter. Also in Australia, private sector credit rose 0.2% in June month-on-month, below the 0.5% gain seen, a worrying signgiven the fall is mainly due to a decline in business credit.
The yen initially soared against the dollar in Thursday's session, amid signals that the Bank of Japan could fail to meet market expectations by approving only moderate easing measures at the highly-anticipated meeting on Friday.
While Prime MInister Shinzo Abe unveiled a broad ¥28 trillion stimulus plan on Wednesday, Reuters reported that the Japanese government may only provide as much as ¥7 trillion in direct fiscal stimulus. If Abe is unable to deliver on promises of jump starting the economy with a broad stimulus initiative, the Japanese Central Bank could feel added pressure to lower interest rates deeper into negative territory.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.36% to 96.34.
Overnight the dollar pared losses as investors received a full day to digest the Federal Reserve's relatively neutral monetary policy statement.
More broadly, the greenback is still up by 2.43% versus its Japanese counterpart since July 12 when former Fed chair Ben Bernanke reportedly outlined the ramifications of a helicopter monetary policy on the Japanese economy at a Tokyo meeting with Abe.
Investors on global foreign exchange markets continued to react to Wednesday's interest rate decision from the U.S. central bank, after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% at the conclusion of its July monetary policy meeting.
Despite noting that near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished over the last month, the FOMC said it still expects that economic conditions may only warrant gradual increases in short-term interest rates in the coming months.
For the most part, markets interpreted the statement as a dovish indication that the FOMC could delay the timing of its next rate hike beyond their next meeting in September. Following the release, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool lowered the probability that the FOMC could raise interest rates in September to 18%, down from 20.3% earlier in the session.
Any rate hikes by the FOMC this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.

The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 23 increased by 14,000 to 266,000 from the previous week’s total of 252,000, which was revised from the initial read of 253,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 7,000 to 260,000 last week.
The data came a day after the Fed left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting, in a widely expected move.
In its monthly policy statement, the Fed said that “near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished” and that the labor market has “strengthened”.
The upbeat outlook fuelled speculation over a rate hike by the U.S. central bank before the end of the year.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2016 09:36AM ET</span>",Yen rises on falling expectations of BOJ stimulus,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The yen gained against the dollar on Thursday as investors feared that the Bank of Japan will not meet high expectations for a large stimulus package when it concludes its two-day meeting on Friday, and after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday stopped short of flagging a near-term rate rise.
Expectations of further stimulus in Japan has dominated trading for the past few weeks and eclipsed attention paid to the U.S. central bank’s statement on Wednesday, when the Fed was seen as indicating that a September rate increase was possible, but not necessarily likely.
“Everybody is waiting for the big marquee event of the week, which is the BOJ announcement tomorrow, to see exactly how large of a stimulus package they are going to put out,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.
Also, “the theme overnight was markets' basic disappointment with the FOMC statement,” Schlossberg said.
Concerns about volatility around the BOJ’s announcement has sent the price of hedging against big swings in the dollar/yen exchange rate over the next 24 hours above 50 percent for the first time since late 2008.

Japan's prime minister unveiled a surprisingly large 28 trillion yen ($265 billion) stimulus package on Wednesday, putting pressure on the central bank to match it with aggressive monetary easing.

Sources told Reuters on Thursday, however, that the government is planning direct fiscal spending of only 7 trillion yen, which, at just a quarter of the total package, could disappoint some market players bracing for bigger outlays given the headline figure.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2016 07:30AM ET</span>",'Helicopter money' might weaken currencies more than QE as sky's the limit,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Central banks might inject no more cash into economies by dropping money from aircraft -- whether real or imaginary -- than via well-worn QE schemes, but in breaking a long-standing taboo they may do far more damage to currencies.
After decades of zero interest rates and quantitative easing-style asset purchases, Japan is still mired in deflation.
As the country gears up for yet more stimulus, financial market speculation has swirled that the Bank of Japan may now go one step further and, by introducing direct funding of government with newly-minted notes, cross into the realm of 'helicopter money'.
The BOJ, holding a two-day policy review that ends on Friday, insists such monetary financing is illegal.
But the yen has tossed and turned regardless, its overnight volatility  reaching levels only seen twice in the past quarter century - in 2008 and the Asian crisis of 1998. 
One focus of the speculation has been on a scenario whereby the BOJ would match new public spending by buying government bonds with perpetual maturities at negligible interest rates that the state would, in effect, never pay back.
The question for the rest of the world is whether the BOJ's dilemma is the future for all major central banks as the world economy stagnates and Japan's demographic of an aging population gradually spreads to other developed nations. 
Currency traders, meanwhile, are debating how - if at all - dropping money from the sky differs from QE.
For many, breaking the policy taboo is more significant than any quantifiable cash impact, offering a powerful restatement of the 'whatever it takes' approach and an answer to anxiety about central banks being out of ammunition.
""It is a move to a world where central bank independence is de facto dead and where we have crossed the Rubicon,"" said Javier Corominas, head of economic research at $53 billion currency fund Record in London. 
""If we do that it will just show that the scale of the problem is huge. At that stage why not monetize everything?""
THE BERNANKE FACTOR
The yen's spikes of the past month can be linked to reports of meetings between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke, famously an advocate of the helicopter drop theorized by monetarist Milton Friedman in the 1960s as an antidote to deflation.
""Markets were reacting to the formality of it, to Japan throwing in the towel and just agreeing to finance new debt with the creation of new money,"" says Derek Halpenny, head of global market research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. 
""That's the reason why longer term I can't see anything but a weaker yen.""
Helicopter money should be a non-starter because most central banks are either explicitly or implicitly banned from direct monetary financing. 
Such a ban forms the centerpiece of the European Central Bank's constitution - but circumstances change.
Just five years ago German politicians and the Bundesbank insisted the ECB could not and would not buy government bonds but, as it ran out of other ways to stimulate growth, legal and political resistance to QE evaporated. 
""You could argue that there is some kind of soft form of helicopter money going on anyway,"" says Halpenny. ""There's a very fine line between monetary policy for policy purposes and for impacting the debt levels.""
To sustainably weaken its currency, then, a country may have to enter what Pictet Asset Management strategists have dubbed ""credible irresponsibility"".
The problem is that if everyone prints, it becomes a zero-sum game for the foreign exchanges - not unlike the parallel rounds of QE in recent years. Despite Japan leading the way, the yen is just as strong now as it was in late 2008.
The other big risk is the cure becoming worse than the disease. 
Global bond investor PIMCO said that since the 18th century there have been 56 examples of direct monetary financing, from France in 1795 to Zimbabwe in 2007. All had dire economic consequences.
Dropping cash directly onto consumers may well be the end of that line and, if that fails to work, governments may be very reluctant to reinstate monetary financing bans in future - creating the threat of systemic collapse.

""The main difference between helicopter and other possibilities, lies in the credibility of the whole monetary system,"" Swiss economist Reto Foellmi told a discussion on Reuters Global Markets Forum this week. ""If helicopter money is done literally, they would cross a point of no return.""

At session-highs, the currency pair peaked at 1.1071, before falling back slightly to 1.1058 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading, up 0.0071 or 0.65% on the session. Before the release, the euro fell as low as 1.0966 against the dollar hovering near four-month lows. Despite Wednesday's rally, the euro has still fallen approximately 3% against the Dollar since voters in the U.K. unexpectedly approved a referendum to leave the European Union on June 24.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0909, the low from June 24 and was met with resistance at 1.1184, the high from July 5.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in a 9-1 vote left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50%. Notably, the FOMC said in its July monetary policy statement that near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished, while economic activity has picked up since the committee last met in June has expanded at a moderate rate. Kansas City Fed president Esther George served as the lone dissenter.
In December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by lifting the Fed Funds Rate by 25 basis points. It represented the first rate hike by the Fed in nearly a decade. Although the FOMC said last December that it could raise interest rates as much as four times in 2016, the Committee lowered its median projections to only two rates hikes for the year, in forecasts released in June.
""The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run,"" the FOMC said in the July statement. ""However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.""
In addition, the FOMC noted that market-based measures of inflation remain low as inflation continues to run below the Committee's long-term 2% targeted goal. The FOMC also said the labor market strengthened in June amid strong gains on the month, while indicators pointed to some increases in labor utilization.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.40% to an intraday low of 96.71 before inching back up to 96.75 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading. In overnight trading on Monday, the index surged to 97.62, reaching its highest level since late-April.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
In the euro area, shares in Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) fell nearly 4% to 13.63 after the beleaguered German bank's second-quarter income plummeted nearly 100% on an annual basis.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2016 03:00PM ET</span>",Templeton's Hasenstab says bet against Mexican peso 'risky',"By Jean Luis Arce
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Fund manager Michael Hasenstab expects Mexico's peso to be supported by the country's solid economy and says investors who are using the currency as a proxy bet against risks in other emerging markets could be burned.
Hasenstab, chief investment officer of Templeton Global Macro, told Reuters in a recent email that he was ""positive"" on the peso and said ""its currently undervalued status has been driven by short-term speculation and proxy hedging strategies.""
The peso has been the third-worst performer among the world's 36 most-traded currencies, down around 9 percent this year, behind the Argentine peso and the British pound.
Due to its position as the most liquid emerging market currency, many investors bet against the peso when global sentiment turns sour on risky assets.
""Those types of short positions in the peso are not remotely consistent with underlying macro-economic fundamentals and they can reverse quite quickly,"" Hasenstab said in an emailed response to questions.
""Investors who shorted the peso to hedge other emerging market currency-risks have taken a very risky bet,"" he said.
Hasenstab said he has invested in Mexican debt with a maturity of less than two years.
The peso recorded its biggest monthly loss in four years in May and is down more than 3 percent this month.
However, the number of bets against the currency registered on the Chicago exchange fell sharply since Mexico's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in late June to 4.25 percent to defend the peso.
""We do also expect further rate hikes by the Bank of Mexico, particularly as the Fed eventually hikes U.S. rates. The Mexican central bank has been quite responsible with anchoring long term inflation expectations,"" Hasenstab said.
He said there was a risk that ""protectionist policies"" in the United States, Mexico's top trading partner, could hit the economy, but not to the extent that Mexico's ability to pay its short-term debt would be harmed. Both U.S. presidential candidates have been critical of the country's free-trade agreements.
""Decade-long progress over structural reforms, prudent fiscal policy, healthy levels of domestic demand, and an improved global market-share bolsters Mexico's ability to weather even a more protectionist trading regime in the United States,"" he said.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2016 08:15AM ET</span>","Yen hit by scale of fiscal plan, new bond issue talk","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Signs of a larger than previously expected fiscal stimulus plan for Japan had the yen back on the defensive on Wednesday, as investors bet the Bank of Japan (BOJ) would match that with a new bout of money-printing aimed at weakening its currency. 
Yen volatility  has neared record highs in the past month on speculation, repeatedly denied by officials, that the BOJ will take the next step in eight years of emergency policymaking by handing money directly to the government with no strings attached.
The latest volley was a report by the Wall Street Journal, again denied by the Ministry of Finance, that Japan was considering issuing 40-year and 50-year bonds. If the central bank was to buy and hold such debt, it would be another step towards outright financing of spending.
Added to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's promise of a stimulus package of more than $265 billion to reflate the flagging economy, that was enough to send the yen 1 percent lower.
""We have had a lot of volatility driven by the different reports this morning,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Thu Lan Nguyen said.
""The moves show that the bigger issue for the market is how this programme is going to be financed. So far it looks like the Bank of Japan is not ready to do something new and that leaves the potential for more downside for the dollar before the meeting on Friday."" 
After falling more than 1 percent in Asian trading, the Ministry of Finance's denial on the bond issue helped the yen recover some ground in morning trade in London. By 1050 GMT, it was down 0.8 percent at 105.51 per dollar. 
The day's big set piece is the U.S. Federal Reserve's statement on policy, due after European markets close and widely expected to sound a more positive note on the economy that may bolster expectations for a rise in U.S. interest rates this year.
In light of that, the dollar has assembled five weeks of gains against the basket of currencies that defines its broader strength (DXY). 
It rose 0.1 percent on Wednesday to stand within sight of a four-month high hit at the end of last week. 
""Some acknowledgement of the improved economic backdrop is likely in the statement and the market will go on slowly raising the odds of a 2016 rate hike,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes said in a morning note. 
""The dollar will go on getting support as the whole treasury curve edges higher (and) the euro is getting stuck below $1.10.""
The euro  inched up to $1.0996.
After a very brief blip higher, sterling was 1/3 to 1/2 a percent lower against the dollar  and euro (EURGBP=). Dealers say there is still consistent selling interest whenever the pound gains. 
Some said the appointment of French former EU internal markets Commissioner Michel Barnier as chief Brexit negotiator bodes ill for the interests of efforts to shore up London's position as Europe's main financial centre in the talks.

The dollar hit highs of 106.54 against the yen and was last at 105.65 by 07:35GMT, or 3:35AM ET, up 0.97% on the day, with traders taking cues from various headlines regarding Japan's economic stimulus package.
Reuters reported, citing Japanese media agency Jiji, that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his government will compile a stimulus package of nearly 28 trillion yen, or $265.3 billion, to prop up Japan's flagging economy. That would be bigger than earlier reports of a possible headline figure of around 20 trillion yen.
Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that Japan was considering issuing 50-year bonds, but later the Ministry of Finance denied that it was considering issuing such debt.
In addition to the details of Japan's fiscal stimulus package, the focus now is on the Bank of Japan's policy decision due on Friday, with expectations running high that the BOJ will expand its monetary stimulus.
Local business daily, Nikkei, reported that policymakers were mulling over multiple stimulus proposals. According to reports, the main options were to cut interest rates beyond the current level of negative 0.1%, buy more Japanese government bonds on top of the current 80 trillion yen annually, or expand purchases of other assets such as exchange-traded funds.
The dollar dropped to as low as 103.98 on Tuesday amid speculation that Japan’s soon-to-be announced stimulus package will disappoint markets.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting later in the day for fresh guidance on the future path of U.S. interest rates.
While the Fed is not expected to take action on interest rates, market players will scrutinize wording in its policy statement for fresh hints on the timing of interest rate hikes over the next several months.
A recent string of better than expected U.S. data reignited speculation that the Fed will raise interest rates before the end of the year. Fed funds futures are currently pricing in a 20% chance of a rate hike by September. December odds were at 52%, compared with less than 10% at the start of this month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 97.30 early on Wednesday, not far from a more than four-month high of 97.59 hit on Monday, boosted by the diverging monetary policy outlook between the Fed and other global central banks.

LONDON (Reuters) - The yen hit a two-week high against the euro and rose more than 1 percent against the dollar on Tuesday, as traders dialed back expectations of how much new stimulus Japanese authorities will inject into an ailing economy.
Most economists surveyed by Reuters expect the Bank of Japan to expand its asset purchases and cut rates further into negative territory at its two-day meeting that ends on Friday.
Meanwhile the government is compiling a spending package that some sources have estimated could be worth up to 20 trillion yen.
Direct fiscal stimulus may be much lower, with a Nikkei report on Tuesday citing a figure of around 6 trillion yen over the next few years. The total size of the package could be announced as soon as Aug. 2, Nikkei said.
Direct stimulus of 6 trillion yen would be double the amount initially planned but would fall short of market expectations, analysts said. 
""There is some position unwinding going on with investors toning down expectations of how much fiscal stimulus will be provided,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. 
""We are also seeing not much pressure from the Japanese government on the BOJ to ease. All this is helping the yen.""
The dollar slid 1.7 percent against the yen to 103.995 , its lowest since July 14 while the euro skidded 1.5 percent to 114.465 yen (EURJPY=), its lowest since July 12.
The yen has weakened in the past few weeks on growing expectations that Japanese authorities would provide both fiscal and monetary stimulus to kick-start inflation. Some had been hoping for helicopter money, where the central bank would underwrite government debt, though policymakers have denied this.
STERLING SLAMMED
Sterling shed 2 percent against the yen (GBPJPY=) and hit a two-week low against the euro (EURGBP=D4) after Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale said he had dropped his opposition to policy easing and now favored immediate stimulus..
The pound also fell 0.5 percent against the dollar to trade at $1.3080  
""When the previously hawkish BoE MPC member Martin Weale turns dovish, market participants better listen,"" said Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to stand pat on policy at its meeting that ends on Wednesday. Fed fund futures on Monday indicated that the market sees nearly no chance of a rate hike this week. But the chances of a December hike rose to 56 percent, up from 48 percent on Friday.

The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.3 percent to 97.003 (DXY), off a high of 97.569, its loftiest peak since March.

The dollar hit lows of 104.10 against the yen, the weakest since July 14 and was last at 104.17 by 07:53GMT, or 3:53AM ET, down 1.55% on the day, after a local media report indicated that the government's highly anticipated stimulus package may not live up to expectations.
Investors were seemingly unimpressed by a Nikkei report the government planned a direct fiscal stimulus of around 6 trillion yen ($56 billion) over the next few years. But that may have disappointed a market looking for as much as 10 trillion to 20 trillion yen in fiscal stimulus.
The dollar had climbed to as high as 107.49 last week, as investors’ expectations had mounted for Tokyo to unveil an aggressive stimulus package.
Market players are also looking ahead to the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting later this week. The BOJ is widely expected to ease policy further at the conclusion of its meeting on Friday, which could include a rate cut deeper into negative territory and additional asset purchases.
Meanwhile, the pound dropped against the dollar, with GBP/USD falling 0.4% to 1.3083, after hitting a session low of 1.3061, amid mounting expectations for a rate cut from the Bank of England at the conclusion of its next policy meeting in early August.
The Financial Times reported that Martin Weale, a member of the BOE's rate-setting committee, had dropped his opposition to an easing and now favored immediate stimulus.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 97.06 early on Tuesday, not far from a more than four-month high of 97.59, boosted by the diverging monetary policy outlook between the Federal Reserve and other global central banks.
While the U.S. central bank is not expected to take action on interest rates at the conclusion of its meeting on Wednesday, market players will scrutinize its policy statement for fresh hints on the timing of interest rate hikes over the next several months.
A recent string of better than expected U.S. data reignited speculation that the Fed will raise interest rates before the end of the year. Interest rate futures are currently pricing in a 52% chance of a rate hike by December, compared with less than 20% a week ago and up from 9% at the start of this month.

After global markets quickly stabilized following an initial panic, Fed governor Daniel Tarullo said at a forum in Washington that he felt the world's financial system prepared itself ""reasonably well,"" to handle the fallout from the Brexit decision.
The FOMC will also convene for the first time since the release of a relatively optimistic June U.S. employment report, in which the labor market added 287,000 nonfarm payrolls last month. The robust job gains could erase some negative sentiments from a disappointing report in May when the economy added only 38,000 nonfarm jobs – its lowest monthly total in six years.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2016 05:02PM ET</span>",IMF sets new SDR calculation method for prepare for yuan's entry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Monday said it adopted a new methodology for calculating the currency amounts in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) the fund uses for transactions, partly to ensure that China's yuan meets the IMF Board's intended weighting.
The changes will apply to a historic rebalancing of the SDR basket on Oct. 1 to include the yuan for the first time, a step that gives China prized reserve currency status and moves the yuan a step closer to being freely usable internationally.
The relative amounts of dollars, euros, yen, pounds and yuan to achieve these weightings in the SDR basket will be set on Sept. 30 and will be fixed for five years.
But the IMF said its previous method of calculating currency amounts in past rebalancings had caused deviations from the intended weights due to complex rounding calculations and other issues. In the 2010 rebalacing, the old method resulted in a dollar weighting that was nearly half a percentage point above the board's intended target.
The new method will involve simpler rounding calculations out to five significant digits, with the potential to round to six digits to more accurately match intended weightings.
The IMF said the method will be easier to replicate on a simple spreadsheet, providing more transparency to market participants.
""The amended methodology allows final currency amounts to produce currency weights that are very close to the weights adopted by the IMF,"" the fund said in a statement. 
In November 2015, the board agreed to introduce the yuan into the SDR basket with a weighting of 10.92 percent. It left the dollar relatively unchanged at 41.73 percent, and reduced weightings for the euro, yen and pound to 30.93 percent, 8.33 percent and 8.09 percent, respectively.
The dollar has risen in value significantly against these currencies since the decision.

In the run-up to the yuan's introduction into the SDR, the IMF said it will publish weekly the prospective calculations of the currency amounts in the SDR basket using the new method.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2016 10:59PM ET</span>","Dollar buoyant vs yen, euro as risk-on mood prevails","By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar was buoyant against the yen and euro on Monday as the risk-on mood inspired by solid U.S. economic data and fading fallout from Brexit continued to lift the U.S. currency and assets.
Upbeat U.S. business activity data out on Friday also added to prospects of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike within the year and supported the greenback.
The global improvement in risk sentiment - Wall Street shares have hit consecutive record highs this month - has weighed on the Japanese currency, which has fallen roughly 7 percent against the dollar from a three-year peak reached soon after the Brexit referendum a month ago.
""Thanks to a strong indicators, concerns about the U.S. economy after Brexit have receded. Add the good corporate results, and faith in the U.S. economy has recovered greatly,"" said Koji Fukaya, resident of FPG Securities in Tokyo
The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.0965  after slipping to a one-month low of $1.0955 on Friday in the wake of shootings in Munich. Against the safe-haven yen the dollar was up 0.3 percent at 106.52  amid a bounce in Tokyo's Nikkei (N225), having recovered from a dip to 105.77 on Friday.
The yen has also been on the defensive amid hopes that the Bank of Japan would further ease monetary policy at its July 28-29 policy meeting.
While the BOJ has effectively dashed hopes that it would adopt unorthodox ""helicopter money"" stimulus methods, the market has maintained its expectations that the central bank would ease in one form or the other.
""Dollar/yen could test the 108 handle if the Fed's comments this week are supportive towards a rate hike and if the BOJ eases. On the other hand, the pair could drop below 105 if the BOJ stands pat as easing expectations are well entrenched,"" said Fukaya at FPG Securities.
Central bank meetings will be the focus of market attention this week, with the Fed also holding a policy conclave on July 26-27.
While the Fed is widely expected to stand pat on monetary policy, investors will be sifting through its statements for the merest hint of a near-term rate increase following recently firm U.S. economic indicators that have revived tightening expectations.
Fed funds futures rates on Friday priced in a 48 percent chance that the Fed will hike rates at its December meeting. A few weeks ago that probability was less than 20 percent.
The net dollar net long position increased to $10.42 billion in the week ended July 19 from $8.01 billion the previous week, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued on Friday.
Still, some market participants saw easing by the BOJ having a limited impact - a potential disappointment for dollar bulls.
""At this point it is hard to tell how much the yen would weaken even if the BOJ were to ease. It is widely expected to ease through its ETF-purchasing program and that won't have much of a yen-weakening effect,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
The ongoing boon for risk assets is a key factor supporting the dollar and weakening the yen, but the headwinds commodity markets are beginning to face could reverse that trend, Yamamoto said.
Sterling steadied at $1.3116  after falling roughly 1 percent on Friday after surveys showed business activity had wilted after the Brexit vote.

The Australian dollar was also little changed, at $0.7471 , after slipping 0.4 percent on Friday against the broadly stronger dollar.

A recent string of better than expected U.S. data reignited speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. Interest rate futures are currently pricing in a 45% chance of a rate hike by December, compared with less than 20% a week ago and up from 9% at the start of this month.
For this week, data on U.S., U.K. and European second quarter gross domestic product is also due.

1364,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 22, 2016 06:29PM ET</span>","U.S. Dollar Index soars to fresh 4-month highs, with Fed meeting on tap","Investing.com -- The U.S. Dollar Index surged to fresh four-month highs on Friday, amid mounting concerns of a recession in the U.K. and improved manufacturing conditions at home, ahead of next week's two-day Federal Reserve meeting.
The index catapulted to a session-high of 97.59 on Friday, before closing the U.S. afternoon session at 97.41, up 0.47 or 0.48% on the day. With the sharp gains, the index reached its highest level since March 10 – the last time it cleared the 98 threshold. Over the four weeks that have passed since last month's historic Brexit referendum, the index has jumped more than 4%, erasing all of the losses from a downbeat spring. The Dollar is virtually flat since mid-December when the Federal Reserve ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
The greenback rose considerably against the British Pound in overnight trading after Markit reported that the British economy shrank at its quickest pace since early-2009, as economists digested the release of the first batch of Post-Brexit data since last month's surprising decision. Markit's U.K. Flash Composite PMI index for July fell 4.5 points to 47.7, exacerbating fears of an imminent recession throughout Britain.
As a result, GBP/USD slid more than 1% to an intraday low of 1.3079, falling back to near 1-week lows. Since voters in the U.K. spooked markets with their decision to leave the European Union on June 24, the Pound Sterling has tumbled nearly 12% against the Dollar.
Currency traders also closely parsed U.S. manufacturing data on Friday after the flash reading for July's PMI Manufacturing Index bounded up by more than a full point to 52.9, soaring to its highest level in nine months. The unexpected rise was driven by a flood of new orders, as new business volume expanded at the fastest pace since October, 2015.
EUR/USD fell more than 0.50% to an intraday low of 1.0956, holding onto most of the losses on Friday afternoon as reports surfaced of a mass shooting at a shopping mall in Munich. As of early Friday evening, the shooting left at least eight dead, while police conducted a manhunt for the suspect. The euro settled at 1.0976, down 0.45% on the session.
Investors await next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) July meeting for further indications on the timing of the U.S. central bank's next rate hike. On Friday, Fed Future Rates from the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the odds of a single rate hike in 2016 at just under 50%.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose one basis point to 1.57%, while yields on the Germany 10-Year fell one basis point to Minus-0.03%. Yields on both 10-year government bonds are down by more than 75 basis points over the last year."

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2016 11:20PM ET</span>",Yen off six-week low after 'helicopter money' mania shot down,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - The yen hovered above six-week lows on Friday after comments from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda dented speculation Japan may be preparing a radical ""helicopter money"" economic stimulus. 
The yen  bounced back to 105.88 yen per dollar from 107.49, its six-week low against the U.S. currency touched on Thursday.
The rebound was triggered by Kuroda's comments on a BBC Radio 4 interview on Thursday playing down the idea of helicopter money, essentially a policy of injecting cash directly to the economy in some form by printing money.
With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe crafting a massive spending package worth about $190 billion to bolster the economy, some speculators had bet the BOJ could be financing the additional spending - likened by economists to dropping large amounts of cash from a helicopter.
The BBC later said its interview with Kuroda had been conducted in mid-June, helping to cool the yen's gains.
But expectations that the BOJ will adopt easing steps at its policy meeting on Friday next week remained strong, whether those measures fall into the category of ""helicopter money"" or not, thus limiting the yen's gains.
""Certainly his comments have not dispelled expectations of easing. I suspect a rough consensus in the market is increase in buying of ETFs and REITs as well as 0.10 percentage point cut in interest rates,"" said Koichi Takamatsu, head of forex at Nomura Securities.
Few market players take Kuroda's words at face value after he introduced negative interest rates in January only days after he said publicly that he was not considering such measures.
A small number of market players, however, think the BOJ may opt to ease later to keep its dwindling fire power.
""I think the BOJ is more likely to ease in November when the government's supplementary budget will be ready, rather than now. I'm not sure if the BOJ feels it needs to act now, when even the Bank of England has not eased,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
The dollar was steadier against other major currencies, with investors still trying to figure out how Britain's decision to leave the European Union will affect the U.S. economy and the policy of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The dollar index stood at 96.917 (DXY) <=USD>, off Wednesday's 4-month peak of 97.323.
The euro was moving little against the dollar after the ECB held off on any immediate further easing of monetary policy on Thursday as expected.
The euro traded at $1.1028 , slightly above this week's low of $1.0980 but little changed from late U.S. levels on Thursday and is also almost flat on the week.
The British pound was also little changed at $1.3230 .
The New Zealand dollar was on a slippery slope after it had fallen to six-week low on Thursday as New Zealand's central bank said further rate cuts were likely as it sets its sights on the high New Zealand dollar and perilously low inflation.
That cemented expectations for easing at its Aug. 11 meeting.

The kiwi stood at $0.6982 , having fallen to $0.6952 on Thursday.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.02% to 96.96.
Overnight, the dollar pared losses against the other major currencies on Thursday, as strong U.S. housing sector data lent support and as upbeat remarks by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi failed to sustainably ease global growth concerns.
Data showed that U.S. existing home sales increased by 1.1% in June to 5.57 million units from the 5.51 million units in May that was revised from the initial read of 5.53 million. The consensus forecast was for a 0.5% decline to 5.48 million units.
The report came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 16 fell by 1,000 to 253,000 from the previous week’s total of 254,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to increase by 11,000 to 265,000 last week.

The currency pair rose to a session-high of 1.1060 as Draghi spoke at a news conference in Frankfurt, before falling back slightly to 1.1028 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading, up 0.0012 or 0.12% on the session. Despite the slight gains, the euro is still down by more than 3% versus the U.S. Dollar since last month's historic Brexit referendum. Over the last month, EUR/USD has remained in range-bound trade between 1.09 and 1.12, amid a relative lack of data on the long-term ramifications of the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0909 the low from June 24 and was met with resistance at 1.1166, the high from July 14.
On Thursday, the ECB's Governing Council left its benchmark interest rate, as well as the pace and duration of its Quantitative Easing program unchanged until it receives more clarity on the implications of Brexit on the euro area economy as a whole. While acknowledging that the U.K.'s decision has provided headwinds to the euro zone's economic outlook, Draghi stressed that the Governing Council could move as soon as September if actions are needed to stimulate the economy.
""If warranted to achieve its objective, the Governing Council will act by using all instruments available within its mandate,"" Draghi said. ""I would stress readiness, willingness (and the) ability to do so.""
Draghi also downplayed forecasts that the U.K.'s departure could shave off as much as 0.5% in annual GDP growth throughout the euro area, noting that the duration and outcome of negotiations between the parties could take years to settle. The head of the ECB also remarked that financial markets showed ""encouraging resilience,"" during the Post-Brexit period, crediting central bank liquidity and the swap lines they created for helping ensure stability.
The Governing Council's latest rate decision came days before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets in Washington next week for its two-day July meeting. As the U.S. labor and housing markets have shown signs of improvement in recent weeks, FOMC participants have appeared split on the timing of its next interest rate hike. The Federal Reserve has held its benchmark interest rate steady at each of its first four meetings this year since raising short-term rates 25 basis points last December.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.25% to an intraday low of 96.77 before rising slightly to 96.94 on Thursday evening. Earlier this week, the index surged above 97 for the first time in four months while reaching its highest level since March 10.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell two basis points to 1.56%. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries are down by more than 75 basis points over the last year."

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2016 04:09AM ET</span>","Yen touches six-week low, eyes on ECB","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar touched a six-week high against the yen on Thursday, bolstered by reports of a doubling of initial expectations for economic stimulus from Tokyo and bets that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will ease policy next week.
After sinking briefly below $1.10 on Wednesday, the euro recovered to trade around a quarter of a percent higher on the run-in to an ECB meeting that currency markets seem confident will deliver no great new easing to weaken the currency. 
In broader terms, the dollar is trading around its strongest since March against a basket of currencies, driven in the past week by a reheating of expectations for another rise in U.S. interest rates before the end of the year. 
With the euro moored to a range of around $1.10-$1.12, that has chiefly been playing out in the dollar-yen exchange rate. 
""The market expects something in easing from the BOJ next week, so that is weighing on the yen,"" said Dominic Bunning, a currency strategist with HSBC in London. 
""Fed pricing has also shifted quite a bit, from a 10 percent chance for a rise this year after the Brexit vote to nearly 50 percent. So in terms of dollar-yen you've got that sort of double whammy for the yen."" 
A broad recovery in risk appetite and speculation about M&A-related flows have also weighed on the yen since investors fled to the traditional security of Japan after Britain's vote last month to leave the European Union.
Gains in Japanese equities, which were supported by media reports that the Japanese government was planning to compile a stimulus package of at least 20 trillion yen, dragged on the yen.
The dollar rose as high as 107.49 yen , its strongest level since June 7, and last changed hands at 106.82 yen, up 0.1 percent on the day. 
The dollar's advance took a pause ahead of chart resistance at around 107.72 yen, the top of the cloud on the daily Ichimoku chart, a popular technical analysis tool.
""Our own view is that the market may still be too optimistic in expectations for bolder measures from BOJ,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. 
""If you look at the breakdown of the fiscal package that has been speculated overnight, the headline figure is obviously very large but the actual amount of fresh fiscal stimulus thru government spending is more modest.""
The euro rose 0.1 percent against the yen (EURJPY=R) to 117.90 yen. Against the dollar, the euro  gained 0.2 percent to $1.1030.

The European Central Bank is seen standing pat at its policy meeting later on Thursday, but the market does expect some hint of future monetary policy easing, forecast to come as early as September.
The biggest faller among a relatively subdued set of moves for major currencies was the New Zealand dollar, down 0.6 percent to $0.6986 , having touched a six-week low of $0.6952.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, as expected by many in markets, used an unusual between-meeting update on policy to say further cuts in interest rates are likely. That cemented expectations for easing at its Aug. 11 meeting.

1391,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2016 06:14PM ET</span>","U.S. Dollar Index hits fresh 4-month highs, ahead of key ECB meeting","Investing.com -- The U.S. Dollar Index surged to fresh four-month highs on Wednesday, extending recent gains as foreign exchange traders await a critical monetary policy meeting from the European Central Bank's Governing Council for indications on the long-term direction of several top currencies.
At session-highs, the index reached as high as 97.37, its highest level since early-March. The dollar is on track for its fourth straight winning session and its sixth over the last 10. Since last month's historic Brexit decision, the dollar has soared approximately 3% against its main rivals.
The U.S. Dollar moved slightly higher against the euro and the British Pound on Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the ECB's Governing Council's first monetary policy meeting since U.K. voters approved a measure paving the way for a British departure from the European Union. On Wednesday, economic indicators showed that consumer confidence in the EU fell sharply by 1.8 in June to Minus-7.6, dropping to the lowest level since November, 2014. In the euro area, the DG ECFIN flash consumer confidence index declined by 0.7 from an upwardly revised Minus-7.2 to Minus-7.9. Analysts expected a reading of Minus-8.0. The Governing Council is widely expected to stand pat at Thursday's meeting, amid a relative lack of data following the Brexit-inspired market shock.
The ECB meeting comes days before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will convene for its two-day July meeting in the middle of next week. Since the Fed left short-term interest rates unchanged at its June FOMC meeting, participants have been largely split on the timing of its next rate hike, amid strong employment and housing figures. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool now sees a 41.6% chance of a 25 point basis hike in December, up from around 20% last week. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY surged more than 1% to an intraday high of 107.44, clearing the 107 level for the first time in six weeks. Earlier, Kyodo reported that the Japanese government is considering a JPY 20 trillion stimulus package – roughly twice the amount than previous reports had indicated. The dollar has surged nearly 7% against the Yen since former Fed chair Ben Bernanke met with Japan prime minister Shinzo Abe last week in Tokyo. The two reportedly discussed the prospect of implementing a stimulus plan involving the use of ""helicopter money"" as a tool for boosting stubbornly-low inflation.
Also on Wednesday, the dollar rose as much as 1.50% against the Turkish Lira to a record-high of 3.0974 after Standard & Poor's lowered Turkey's credit rating deeper into junk territory. Turkey president Recep Erdogan declared a three-month State of Emergency earlier on the day in the wake of last week's failed coup attempt. The Dollar has surged more than 7% against the Lira over the last four sessions.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained three basis points on Wednesday to 1.58%. Despite the modest gains, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries are down more than 75 basis points over the last year."

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2016 07:08AM ET</span>","Dollar index at 4-month high on strong U.S. data, Fed hike hopes","By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar hit a four-month high against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, bolstered by strong U.S. data and growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise rates before the end of the year.
Commerce Department data showed U.S. housing starts surged 4.8 percent, underpinning a theme of strength in the economy.
Fed funds futures rates point to investors seeing around a 40 percent chance the Fed will raise interest rates by its December meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, compared with less than 20 percent a few weeks ago. Expectations of a Fed hike come as other major central banks around the world gear up to ease monetary policy.
The dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of six major rivals, hit a peak of 97.323 (DXY) in European trade, its highest level since March 10. It was last trading at 97.104, a tad higher on the day.
The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 106.715 yen , its highest level since June 24, when markets were shaken by Britain's surprise vote to exit the European Union. 
""The dollar is now being supported by rising U.S. rate expectations. The likelihood of a Fed rate hike before the end of the year that is being priced in by the markets has almost returned to the levels seen before the EU referendum,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""Most recently the rising rate hike expectations are mainly due to better economic and inflation developments in the US.""
Speculators have also been unwinding their safe-haven bids in the yen as the initial shocks from the Brexit vote dissipated, and expectations rose of additional easing from the Bank of Japan at its July 28-29 meeting. 
A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect further BOJ easing.
Japanese policymakers are unlikely to go as far as funding government spending through direct debt monetisation, dubbed ""helicopter money"", but might pursue a mix of aggressive fiscal and monetary expansion to battle deflation, according to sources. 
The dollar's rise saw the euro  fall to $1.10980, its lowest since June 27. The European Central Bank will hold a regular policy meeting on Thursday, its last before an eight-week break. It is not expected to take any additional easing steps but could take a dovish line given the uncertainty from Brexit.
""The ECB governing council is unlikely to say anything supportive of the currency at its Thursday meeting,"" said John Hardy, head of currency strategy at Saxo Bank.

Meanwhile, sterling outperformed, rising 0.5 percent to $1.3175  after a Bank of England survey showed no clear evidence of a slowing of economic activity after last month's Brexit vote. [GBP/]

1401,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 19, 2016 06:38PM ET</span>","U.S. Dollar Index surges to 4-month high as Euro, Pound continue slump","Investing.com -- The U.S. Dollar Index rose sharply on Tuesday, soaring to a fresh four-month high, as the greenback surged against the euro and the British Pound ahead of a key European Central Bank meeting later this week.
At session-highs, the index surged to 97.18, soaring to its highest level since March 9. The index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, is up considerably in the aftermath of last month's historic Brexit decision. More broadly, the index is up more than 4% since touching down to 10-month lows in early-May.
The Pound Sterling crashed by more than 1.1% to 1.3075 against the dollar, falling to its lowest level in a week. It came after U.K. international trade secretary indicated that the ministry could target January 1, 2019 as a potential Brexit date. At the same time, Fox noted that the date could be pushed forward if necessary. Separately, first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it still remains possible that Scotland could stay in the European Union, as well as U.K. A referendum for Scotland's departure from the U.K. was defeated handily in 2014.
The euro also fell more than 0.5% against the Dollar to an intraday low of 1.1000, remaining near three-month lows. On Sunday, reports surfaced that the Italy government is working on a proposal to establish a €50 billion bad bank loan facility to provide a lifeline for its struggling bank sector. The reports have triggered fresh concerns about potential insolvency among a host of top Italian banks.
Meanwhile, when the ECB's Governing Council meets on Thursday the ECB is widely expected to stand pat in its first interest rate decision since last month's historic Brexit referendum. Many analysts expect the ECB to hold rates steady given the relative lack of economic data since the U.K.'s shocking decision on June 24.
Next week, the Federal Reserve will also issue its latest interest rate decision upon the completion of its two-day July meeting on July 27. Since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left short-term rates unchanged in June, a number of policymakers have been split on the timing of the U.S. central bank's next rate hike. Any rate hikes this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Elsewhere, USD/TRY rallied from sharp early losses to hit an intraday high of 3.0602, approaching near 1-year highs. The Dollar has gained nearly 6% against the Turkish Lira since Friday's failed military coup in Ankara and Istanbul.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell three basis points to 1.55%. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasuries have plunged nearly 80 basis points over the last year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a four-month high against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday after the release of data showing U.S. housing starts rose more than expected in June, underpinning a theme of strength in the U.S. economy.
Groundbreaking on U.S. homes surged 4.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.19 million units, the Commerce Department said.
After June's jobs report showed U.S. employers added 287,000 jobs, beating expectations by more than 100,000, continued positive data has some investors pricing back in the chances the Federal Reserve will raise U.S. overnight interest rates, analysts said.
Higher interest rates increase a currency's return, making it more attractive to investors.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose to 97.126, its highest level since mid-March.
The rise in the dollar index was backed by a sizeable fall in the euro , which dipped to an 11-day low against the dollar of $1.1011. The euro was last down 0.5 percent at $1.1017.
The dollar also gained ground against the yen , touching its highest level against the Japanese currency since June 24, the day after Britain's surprise vote to leave the European Union. The dollar rose to 106.52 yen.
""There’s more enthusiasm about the U.S. economy,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in New York. ""It hasn’t really translated into a big increase in Fed tightening expectations but I think markets are starting to think the Fed could be back in the picture before the end of the year.""
Fed funds futures rates show investors see almost a 50/50 chance that the U.S. central bank raises rates by its December meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Chances of a rate hike were below 20 percent less than a month ago.
The dollar also was boosted by expectations of upcoming central bank easing from the Reserve Bank of Australia and Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
The Australian dollar fell 1.5 percent to an 11-day low of $0.7476, while the New Zealand dollar hit a three-week trough, falling 1.35 percent to 0.7018, as investors ramped up bets that both central banks could ease monetary policy as early as next month.

""There are a lot of individual stories,"" Serebriakov said. ""It’s been kind of a combination of idiosyncratic drivers for currencies as well as the broader dollar story.""

Specifically, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, hit an intraday high of 97.17, a level not seen since March. It was last up 0.56% at 97.10.
In a report, the U.S. Commerce Department said that housing starts jumped 4.8% to hit a seasonally adjusted 1.189 million units, beating consensus expectations for an increase to only 1.17 million.
At the same time, building permits, considered a leading indicator for the housing market, increased 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted 1.153 million units, settling above forecasts for an increase to 1.15 million.
USD/JPY was creeping back towards the June 24 high, day in which the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union (EU), known as a Brexit, was revealed.
In that light, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its updated global forecasts on Tuesday, reducing the projection for growth in the worldwide economy in 2016 to 3.1%, from the prior 3.2%, though expecting a rebound to 3.4% in 2017.
The U.K. was hardest hit with the IMF cutting its forecast to 1.7% from the prior 1.9% for this year and slashing 2017 growth to 1.3% from April’s estimate of 2.2% due to the Brexit.
The euro zone did not escape unscathed as 2017 growth expectations were cut to 1.4% from the prior 1.6%.

The U.S. dollar was also stronger against the commodity currencies.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars sank on Tuesday, as investors ramped up bets that both central banks could ease monetary policy as early as next month.
The Aussie fell to more than a one-week low, while the kiwi hit a three-week low.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said the rate of consumer price inflation (CPI) rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% last month, above forecasts for a gain of 0.4% and compared to the 0.3% increase seen in May.
Though sterling initially pared losses on the news managing to break through $1.32, the strength was shown to be temporary.
At 9:01AM GMT, or 5:01AM ET, GBP/USD was trading down 0.55% to 1.3181, near levels seen just prior to the release. EUR/GBP showed a similar pattern, trading up 0.47% to 0.8392.
On Monday, the pound hit intraday highs after Bank of England policymaker said he was unsure if he would support an interest rate cut at the central bank’s August meeting.
The comments, which came during a speech in London, contrast with the view of most other BoE policymakers.
Last Thursday’s minutes of the BoE’s July meeting gave a clear indication the bank will ease monetary policy next month to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
The BoE kept interest rates on hold at 0.5% in a surprise decision.
Meanwhile, credit rating agency Moody’s warned in a report issued late Monday that the U.K.’s credit worthiness was under downward pressure following its decision to exit the EU.
Moody’s said medium-term growth prospects for the British economy could be weaker if it fails to reach a new trade agreement with Europe and said that the growth would slow significantly in the near term. 
The credit rating agency forecast the U.K.’s growth to be 1.5% in 2016 and close to 1% for 2017.
That report came ahead of the IMF’s own estimates scheduled to be released at 13:00GMT, or 9:00AM ET.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2016 06:51AM ET</span>","Yen slips as Turkey quashes coup, Softbank deal eyed","By Yumna Mohamed and Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen sank back toward three-week lows against the dollar on Monday as investors unwound a surge of safe-haven trades done on the back of reports of an attempted military coup in Turkey on Friday. 
Turkey widened a crackdown on suspected supporters of the failed coup on Sunday, taking the number of people rounded up in the armed forces and judiciary to 6,000, and the government said it was in control of the country and economy.
That eased concerns over the prospect of another major round of turmoil to add to Europe’s economic and political problems, drawing investors back into higher-risk currencies and out of the traditional security of the yen. 
""The scenario looks a bit calmer now ... so we're back to thinking about the sort of policy outlook that had the yen falling against the dollar last week,"" said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC in London.
Intense discussion in the past week around the prospect of the Bank of Japan directly funding a rise in government spending as ""helicopter money"" has weakened the yen against most other major currencies.
Some dealers, without citing actual knowledge of flows, said last week's gains for sterling against the yen might also have been inflated by flows related to Softbank's (T:9984) $32 billion purchase of Britain's ARM Holdings (L:ARM).
The pound has gained 9 percent against the yen in the past 8 days (GBPJPY=), while the dollar rose just under 5 percent.
But the broader world environment is dominated by moves by central banks toward more stimulus of the economy after a series of political blows to investment and failure of several rounds of money-printing to get growth going again.
""If you look at the course over the last 5 years, the big moves on dollar/yen all come on the back of monetary policy,"" said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon. 
""The fact that you can have a five percent move just on people thinking what they might do tells you what you need to know on where the focus really is."" 
The dollar gained almost 1 percent on the day to 105.80 yen, having reached as high as 106 yen in Asian time.
The morning's other big mover was sterling, at one stage up almost a full cent against the dollar after Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale said there was no urgent need to cut interest rates and pointed to problems with both more cuts and any further quantitative easing. 
But with most major banks forecasting the pound will fall as the economic fallout of last month's vote to leave the European Union becomes clearer in the months ahead, there are sellers of sterling on any such rally. It was up just 0.2 percent at $1.3227 by 1030 GMT. 
There is also some chance of the European Central Bank reducing at least one of its main interest rates on Thursday priced into short-term market interest rates, although CIBC's Stretch said there was little of such speculation on the euro. 

The single currency, tied down in a tight $1.10-$1.12 range since the Brexit vote, gained 0.2 percent to $1.1046. It rose as much as 1.2 percent to 117.01 yen. (EURJPY=)

1413,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 17, 2016 03:13PM ET</span>",Forex - EUR/USD weekly outlook: July 18 - 22,"Investing.com - The euro fell sharply against the dollar and the safe haven yen late Friday as risk aversion spiked after Turkey’s prime minister said an attempted military coup was under way.
EUR/USD fell 0.83% to 1.1029 in late trade and EUR/JPY was down 1.22% at 115.74 after segments of the military took over key bridges in Istanbul and attacked parliament buildings in Ankara.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.62% to 96.7.
Demand for the dollar had been boosted earlier Friday as upbeat economic reports out of the U.S. and China bolstered risk appetite.
The Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% in June, the third straight monthly increase and easily outstripping gains of 0.1% forecast by economists.
Chinese data on industrial production and retail sales also beat expectations, indicating that the world’s second largest economy still has momentum.
The yen remained under pressure amid mounting expectations for additional monetary easing by Tokyo.
But the single currency rose against the pound with EUR/GBP up 0.56% to 0.8366 after the Bank of England’s chief economist said it is poised to ease monetary policy in August to counteract the negative economic shock from the vote to leave the European Union.
Sterling had strengthened across the board a day earlier after the BoE kept interest rates on hold at the conclusion of its policy meeting, dashing expectations for a rate cut.
In the week ahead, market players will be focusing on the outcome of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting to see if policymakers will step up easing measures to offset the fallout from the Brexit vote.
The ECB is not widely expected to implement any changes to monetary policy ahead of updated inflation forecasts at its September meeting.

Speaking exclusively with Turkish television network NTV, prime minister Binali Yildrim said military officers engaged in an illegal action on Friday night, but refused to characterize the attempt as a coup. Shortly after, a military group announced on national television that it had seized control of the country, as soldiers blocked traffic on Istanbul's Bosphorus Bridge. Meanwhile, Turkey president Recep Erdogan attempted to drum up support among the public, telling CNN Turk that the coup attempt will not succeed and that the plotters of the takeover will ""pay a heavy price.""
""There is no power higher than the power of the people,"" Erdogan said, via Facetime. ""The judiciary will swiftly respond to this attack.""
The U.S. Dollar soared to an intraday-high of 3.0497 against the Turkish Lira, before falling back slightly to 3.0137, up 4.71% on the session. The dollar continued to gain strength versus the Lira late on Friday night, as Turkish citizens flooded ATMs in a massive run on the banks. At the same time, investors piled into a host of safe-haven assets, as Gold rose 0.43% to $1,337.90, while the U.S. 10-Year fell to 1.558% erasing some of its earlier gains. The S&P 500 Futures Fund fell by 0.21% to 2,152.75 and the iShares MSCI Turkey ETF, a $364 million fund that tracks top Turkish equities, plunged by more than 5.2% to 39.40 in after-hours trading.
Earlier, Turkey media outlets reported that an attempted coup broke out around 21:00 local time (2:00 EST) after two F-16s were spotted at low altitude flying over the Parliament building in Ankara. In addition, military officers reportedly gained control of airports in Istanbul and Ankara, preventing landings in both major cities.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.65% to an intraday high of 96.70, extending earlier gains. The index has still declined by approximately 3% since early-December.
There have been at least three attempts by the military to take over the government since 1960, the last coming in 1980. In 1993, former Turkey president Turgut Özal was reportedly assassinated in the midst of a prolonged Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which included an alleged coup attempt by the Turkey military."

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2016 04:09AM ET</span>",Yen set for biggest weekly drop since February '99 as China data boosts risk,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen hit a three-week low against the dollar on Friday and was set for its biggest weekly fall in 17 years after data pointed to stabilization in the Chinese economy, bolstering global risk sentiment.
The dollar rose to 106.32 yen , its strongest level since June 24 in Asian trade, before giving up some of its gains in Europe to trade at 105.80. European shares fell in early deals hurt by an attack in the French city of Nice that killed more than 80 people. (EU)
For the week though, the dollar has rallied 5.2 percent against the yen, putting it on track for its best weekly performance against the yen since February 1999, as expectations of a huge stimulus from Japan weighed on the yen.
Such speculation has come to the fore after former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke visited the Bank of Japan earlier this week, fuelling talk BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda might provide ""helicopter money"", which would involve the central bank directly financing government spending.
Government and central bank officials directly involved in policymaking, however, have said there is no chance Japan will resort to ""helicopter money"".
The euro gained 0.6 percent to 117.80 yen (EURJPY=R), while even the battered British pound rose 0.6 percent to 141.42 yen (GBPJPY=R).
""The Chinese data is helping risk sentiment. Overall, we have had some good headlines this week, like more political stability in the UK, expectations of more Japanese stimulus and all these are contributing to investors selling the yen,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Normura. 
Latest data from China showed growth, industrial output and retail sales all beat forecasts, indicating there was some resilience in the economy. That is expected to underpin the recent buoyancy of world markets while investors await a better reading from the post-Brexit referendum period in the coming weeks.
""There had been some concerns about the (Chinese) economy but the latest numbers show that it's doing alright,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
The yen is regarded as a safe haven currency partly because of Japan's net creditor status. As a result, the yen tends to rise in times of market stress, but often comes under pressure when investor risk appetite improves.

Sterling gained 1 percent to $1.3481 , its highest in two weeks, staying firm after the Bank of England (BoE) kept interest rates on hold on Thursday, wrong-footing many investors who had expected a rate cut following Britain's shock vote on June 23 to leave the European Union.

The currency pair surged more than three cents to two-week highs 1.3463, before falling back slightly to 1.334 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading, up 1.47% on the session. The Pound Sterling opened on Thursday at 1.3121 after halting a three-day winning streak a day earlier. Since dipping below 1.28 last week to touch down to fresh 31-year lows, the Pound has rallied by 3% over the last week against its American counterpart. Over the last three weeks, the British counterpart has tumbled nearly 10% in the wake of the U.K.'s historic decision to leave the European Union on June 24.
The Pound is now on pace for its strongest one-week move against its main rivals in nearly six years.
In the U.K., the Bank of England jolted markets by holding their key interest rate steady at 0.5% and leaving its comprehensive Quantitative Easing program unchanged on Thursday afternoon. Following the 8-1 vote, Bank of England governor Mark Carney hinted that the BOE could approve fresh stimulus measures when meets again on August 4.
While the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) indicated that it will support any measure that helps promote economic growth and return inflation to its targeted objective, the participants appeared leery of making a knee-jerk reaction to last month's Brexit historic decision. Such a move, according to many economists, may have demonstrated excessive panic as markets throughout the euro area remain on edge. Annual consumer inflation in the U.K. remained at 0.3% in June, after hitting 15-month highs this spring.
""The exact extent of any additional stimulus measures would be based on the Committee’s updated forecast,"" the MPC said in a statement. ""Their composition would take account of any interactions with the financial system and their effectiveness in supporting the domestic economy. Further detailed analysis across all policy areas of the Bank would be required.""
In addition, the minutes showed that the lone dissenter noted that the subdued economic outlook had ""come close to warranting further stimulus,"" last month ahead of the referendum. The Bank of England's benchmark interest has remained steady at 0.5% over the last seven years.
In the U.S.,  jobless claims last week were unchanged at a seasonally-adjusted total of 254,000, lingering near 43-year lows. In April, new jobless claims throughout the U.S. fell by 6,000 to 247,000, dropping to their lowest level since November, 1973. Meanwhile, the four-week average on Thursday declined slightly to 259,000, falling roughly 10,000 below the one-month mean from mid-June.
Also on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that producer prices last month rose considerably, building on increased pricing pressure from May's report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' PPI-FD rose by 0.5% in June, slightly up from 0.4% gains a month earlier and above consensus estimates of 0.3%. The Core PPI-FD, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, jumped 0.3% on a monthly basis, swinging to a gain after a slight decrease of 0.1% in May.
During a series of public appearances since the Fed last met in late-June, a wide range of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members have offered diverging comments on the timing of the U.S. central bank's next rate hike. While delivering a speech in Houston on Wednesday, Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan indicated that the FOMC can remain accommodative as long as its dual mandate in terms of inflation and employment objectives are not met. Shortly after, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker said the FOMC could raise short-term interest rates as much as twice this year.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.30% to an intra-session low of 95.84 before rebounding slightly to 96.10 at the close of the U.S. afternoon session. The index has fallen by more than 3% since early-December.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose by six basis points to 1.54%, while yields on the UK 10-Year gained five basis points to 0.79%. Yields on both 10-year government bonds are down by more than 85 basis points over the last year."

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2016 06:58AM ET</span>","Yen hits three-week low, sterling steps up ahead of BoE meeting","By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen sank across the board on Thursday as the upbeat mood on global stock markets stretched into a sixth day and media reports stoked speculation the Bank of Japan could take steps to fund government spending directly. 
Sterling made solid gains against the yen, the dollar and the euro ahead of a Bank of England meeting widely expected to cut interest rates to help offset the blow to the economy from last month's vote to leave the European Union. 
The New Zealand dollar  also fell after central bankers there said they would issue an economic update before next month's policy meeting - an unusual step read by some as a sign the Reserve Bank was preparing to cut rates. 
But it was the yen's moves that grabbed the most attention, sliding past 105 per dollar, with dealers citing a Bloomberg report saying ex-Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke had raised the prospect of the BoJ issuing ""perpetual bonds"". 
""We had this big move up at 7.30 this morning on the story about Bernanke floating this idea. It pushed the dollar through 105 yen and caught some stops along the way,"" said Alvin Tan, a strategist with  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London. 
""We've heard a lot of talk about fiscal policy out of Japan. Something will happen on that front. The big question is whether there will be further monetary easing and coordination of the two. That does seem possible.""
The dollar gained 1.1 percent to 105.62 yen , hitting its highest level since late June.
If the government issued perpetual bonds directly to the BOJ, it could amount to the Bank funding government spending directly by printing new yen, for the first time shooting ""helicopter money"" directly at businesses and consumers. 
Another of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's advisers poured cold water on the idea in an interview with Reuters published after the Bloomberg story and government sources later outright denied perpetual bonds were being considered.
But with Abenomics widely considered to have failed so far, traders are wondering if the government and BOJ will come up with more radical monetary and fiscal stimulus measures soon.
That plays in to a broader world environment where central banks are again thinking more about stimulus than hopes the economy will prove strong enough to finally begin to put an end to the era of ultra-low interest rates and money-printing.
""It's the ideas here that are powerful,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment at currency fund Millennium Global. ""Remember it took six months the first time for the details of Abenomics to come out, and in that time the dollar moved from 80 to 100 yen. So this may just be getting started.""
Speculation is rife that the Bank of England could also head for a new round of quantitative easing within months. That should add up to a weaker pound, although SocGen's Tan argued that the prospect of longer-term support for growth was offering sterling some support. 
New Prime Minister Theresa May also replaced austerity Chancellor George Osborne in the first moves in her cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday and gave hints that the government may be less keen on cutting public spending further. 
Sterling  was up 0.7 percent at $1.3235, though it was still well short of 1-week highs hit during the day on Wednesday.
The BoE is expected to announce a cut to its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25 percent from 0.5 percent when its makes its monthly policy statement at 1100 GMT.

""If they don't move we should see $1.35 and everyone will think that is an invitation to sell the pound,"" said Millennium's Benson. ""If they do, then its $1.30 and probably some more stability from there before we get the next round.""

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 09:40AM ET</span>",Brexit raises questions about pound's elite status,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's vote to leave the European Union is raising questions about sterling's place among the small, elite group of hard currencies underpinning the financial system.
The pound's 14 percent slide since the vote to 31-year lows against the dollar is the biggest hit taken by one of these currencies in the post-1973 floating exchange rate system. 
For Britons, the impact may feel slight or even ambiguous. Consumers of imported goods may see them become more expensive and travelers will find foreign trips more costly. Exporters, on the other hand, may find their products more competitive abroad and any overseas earnings get a boost.
But a bigger international impact could come if sterling's status as one of the currencies held in reserve savings by central banks and sovereign wealth funds is cast in doubt, risking a weaker and more volatile pound longer-term. 
Reserve currencies are typically seen as dependable and easily convertible long-term stores of value, needed to meet emergency imports, service international debt, or to smooth the effects of volatile trade and investment shifts on local currency rates. 
These hard cash reserves are then often banked back in the assets, mostly government debt, of the currency issuer. This is important for Britain, which relies on an inflow of foreign capital to fund a chronic current account deficit running at 7 percent of economic output. 
But credit rating agency S&P Global warned sterling's role as a reserve currency could, over time, diminish. It said this was one reason Britain's credit rating, which it cut by two notches days after the June 23 vote, could be cut further.
""Sovereigns controlling a reserve currency benefit from extensive external and monetary flexibility, which supports government creditworthiness,"" said Frank Gill, director of sovereign ratings at S&P.
""A UK departure from the EU could put sterling's reserve status at risk by deterring foreign direct investment and other capital inflows into the UK.""
Weaker growth prospects as flagged by the Bank of England, along with a weaker pound could also see reserve managers allocate assets toward other currencies.
THIRD HIGHEST SHARE 
Sterling, the dominant reserve currency through the 19th century when the British empire was at its height and until World War Two, has ceded ground to the U.S. dollar and the euro. It is now the third most widely held - even if a relatively small 4.8 percent of so-called allocated reserves in the first quarter of 2016, according to IMF data. 
But that is around $344 billion or some 13 percent of Britain's gross domestic product of $2.7 trillion and nearly five times its 2015 current account deficit of $73 billion.
Sterling's share was dwarfed in the period by the dollar's 63.6 percent and the euro's 20.4 percent but was slightly more than the yen's 4.1 percent slice. S&P reckons a drop below 3 percent would challenge its status as a reserve currency.
Reserve managers are slow to change the composition of their reserves, and if they do make a shift, act discreetly to avoid undermining the currencies in question.
The dollar's share of reserves dipped to about 60 percent in the years after the 2008/09 global financial crisis before picking up as the euro's share fell in the euro zone crisis. 
Sterling's share has barely moved from a decade ago, though it has gained in prominence from the 3 percent share in 2001.
Central banks declined to comment on whether sterling's share would drop. However, one Asian central banker, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters a decision would be based on macro-economic conditions and the currency's short- and long-term outlook.
""There won't be any knee-jerk reaction. UK is the world's sixth-largest economy and a major trading partner to many countries,"" said Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) strategist Neil Mellor.
In recent years, reserve managers, with an accumulated $11 trillion in assets, have diversified out of the traditional reserve currencies like the euro and yen, seeking higher yields in the likes of the Australian and Canadian dollars.
The euro has borne the brunt of this process, and stripping out valuation effects, since foreign exchange reserves are priced in dollars, the single currency's share of overall reserves has retreated from a high of 28 percent in 2009.
That coincided with the single currency's fall from $1.38 in mid-2014 to a 12-year low of $1.04 in March 2015 as the European Central Bank cut rates into negative territory, making euro zone government bonds less attractive.
Now it could be the pound's turn given expectations that rates could be cut to zero and of more quantitative easing.

""Slower growth, lower yield, weaker credit ratings, might suggest that sterling's role as a reserve currency is somewhat diminished,"" said Roger Hallam, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management's CIO for currency management.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>",Yen under pressure as global stock markets rally,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen lost ground on Wednesday, extending losses against the dollar after recording its biggest two-day fall in almost two years, as risk appetite bounced back in the European session. 
The safe-haven yen had tumbled 4 percent against the dollar since the start of the week, its worst performance since November 2014, after Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition won a clear victory in upper house elections, fuelling expectations of more fiscal stimulus. 
Monday's news that Britain would by Wednesday have a new prime minister - current interior minister Theresa May - and a bumper U.S. jobs report at the end of last week had also boosted risk sentiment, which had served to further dent the yen. 
Some investors had hoped that former U.S. Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke's meetings with Japanese leaders this week would herald the adoption of ""helicopter money"", a term which Bernanke has in the past mentioned as a way central banks might finance government budgets to fight deflation. 
But the dollar hit a session low of 103.95 yen  shortly after Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga downplayed the idea. 
Nevertheless, the dollar recovered lost ground and was last trading at 104.80, up 0.1 percent on the day. The euro was also up 0.2 percent at 116.02 yen (EURJPY=)
""Globally we are seeing an environment where investors are buying riskier assets and that is putting the yen under pressure"" said Petr Krpata, currency strategist at ING. ""There is a lot of expectations of some mega stimulus from Japan. If they disappoint, we could see the yen bounce back.""
Currencies seen as riskier plays that had rallied sharply on Tuesday such as the Australian dollar  and the New Zealand  dollar, which had hit a 14-month high, were all trading higher. 
Later in the day, a Bank of Canada meeting on monetary policy is in focus. Though analysts are not expecting an interest rate cut, they think a dovish tone could be struck in the wake of the vote for Brexit, which could weigh on the Canadian dollar, which was up 0.2 percent. 
""With consumption still running soft and job and wage gains muted, the accompanying monetary policy report and press conference could emphasize downside risk,"" analysts at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) wrote.
""Rates markets are currently pricing only small chance of further policy easing and have room to increase pricing if the Bank starts to sound more concerned.""

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 04:00AM ET</span>",Sterling firm with eyes on new prime minister's Brexit view,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling was firmer on Wednesday, trading near a two-week high against the euro as Theresa May was set to take over as Britain's prime minister, easing some of the political uncertainty that has dogged the currency in the past few weeks.
Traders will keep an eye on who will be appointed as finance minister with many awaiting for clarity on the new prime minister's detailed thinking on triggering Article 50, the procedure for exiting the European Union.
May has said ""Brexit means Brexit"", but added Britain will not rush to trigger the formal divorce proceedings. The uncertainty over whether Britain will be able to retain access to the single market after exiting the EU, along with expectations that the Bank of England could cut rates on Thursday, are likely to make traders wary of sterling.
Sterling was up 0.1 percent at $1.3270, having hit a high of $1.3340 in the Asian session, its highest since July 4, and well above a 31-year low of $1.2798 struck on July 6. 
The euro was down 0.3 percent at 83.25 pence, having fallen to 83 pence in Asia, its lowest since June 30. 
""It remains unclear for the time being as to whether the UK will retain free access to the single market, and therefore the potential for setbacks in sterling is high,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""After all, the massive current account deficit causes considerable concern against the background of continued uncertainty.""
Britain runs a current account deficit pegged at around 7 percent of gross domestic product - amongst the highest in the developed world. That makes the pound vulnerable to changes in foreign capital flows needed to plug the gap.
BoE chief Mark Carney has hinted he may ease policy to cushion the economy from Britain's shock decision to exit the EU, with markets pricing in a more than 70 percent of a 25 basis point rate cut on Thursday. The BoE has said the economy is likely to suffer a slowdown in coming months.
""We think the pound's rally will run out of steam once investors learn that the economy is likely to slow down from the investment side, weakening employment and then finally consumption,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a morning note.

Officials from the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, said on Tuesday Britain would fall into recession over the coming year and growth in each of the next five years would be at least 0.5 percentage points lower as a result of Brexit.

""With the AUD lifting above USD0.76 and the inflation target at risk it seems a sensible policy option to cut rates further. However, we are mindful that despite cutting rates the Board did not lower its growth forecasts indicating that the motivation behind the May decision was entirely around the need to credibly achieve the inflation target over the forecast period. Rigid adherence to that policy in future might be questioned particularly, as hinted at in this survey, if the rate cuts spill over into excessive exuberance in asset markets. Hence we expect that this cut will, most likely, be the last in the current easing cycle"", Evans said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen hit a more than two-week low against the dollar on Tuesday and fell 1 percent versus the euro, as a weekend election victory by Japan's ruling coalition fanned expectations of more stimulus and bolstered risk sentiment. 
Gains in global stock markets saw investors cut holdings in the yen, which had risen on safe haven demand after Britain's vote to leave the European Union added to worries over global growth. But Tuesday's drop in the yen saw it erase gains made after the shock Brexit vote on June 23. 
The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 103.64 yen , its strongest since June 24, when the British referendum result sent ripples across global markets. The euro also jumped 1 percent to 114.93 yen (EURJPY=R), its highest since June 24. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that he will instruct Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara on Tuesday to start work on compiling a fiscal stimulus package, but did not indicate a size.
Ruling party sources had told Reuters before the election that the government was ready to spend more than 10 trillion yen. Another focus is whether the Bank of Japan will expand monetary stimulus at its policy meeting in late July.
Traders in London said former Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke's presence in Tokyo had also boosted expectations that the BOJ was preparing for more easing. The BOJ adopted negative rates earlier this year in addition to its asset buying program, but is far from achieving its inflation target.
""The market is now priced for more than 10 trillion yen, but it will be more about the fiscal-monetary coordination that is driving markets,"" said Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
""The previous Fed Chairman Bernanke, who initiated QE3, is visiting the BOJ, inflating markets with expectations that the BOJ is accompanying the fiscal stimulus with ultra-loose policies, taking Japan closer to what is widely known as providing helicopter money."" 
Traders said the yen's drop has been exacerbated by position squaring.
""In dollar/yen, there had been an excessive build up of yen-buying positions and such bets are getting squeezed,"" said Shinsuke Sato, head of FX trading group for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.

USD/JPY changed hands at 103.00, up 0.20%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7588, up 0.72%. GBP/USD traded at 1.3091, up 0.77%.
In Australia, the NAB business confidence survey for June came in at plus-6, a better reading than the previous level at plus-3, and the business survey for June reached plus-12, also better than a previous reading of plus-10.
NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster said the survey suggests the RBA should be reasonably comfortable with the present state of economic activity, even in the wake of recent events that cloud the outlook. ""However, the view on inflation is arguably more important at this juncture, and the survey is not suggesting any meaningful turnaround in near-term inflation pressures. These trends justify the highly accommodative setting for monetary policy,"" he said.
Oster added that while the August RBA meeting following Q2 inflation data is likely to be 'live', current information suggests rates will remain on hold.

1453,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2016 06:25PM ET</span>","USD/JPY surges 2%, after Abe toasts victory by unveiling fresh stimulus","Investing.com -- USD/JPY surged by more than 2% on Monday, enjoying its best one-day move than 10 weeks, as foreign exchange traders reacted to broad indications that the Japanes government could be ready to unleash a fresh round of stimulus measures, following a resounding victory by Shinzo Abe's party in parliamentary elections over the weekend.
The currency pair rose sharply in Monday's session to hit a high of 102.89, before falling back slightly to 102.78 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading, up 2.07% on the day. With the considerable gains, the Dollar recorded its highest one-day against the Yen since late-April. Before Monday's significant rally, the Dollar traded near two-month lows versus its Japanese counterpart. Since opening the year around 120 against the Yen, the Dollar has crashed nearly 15%.
USD/JPY likely gained support at 99.08, the low from June 24 and was met with resistance at 107.28, the high from June 10.
The dollar staged a massive rally against the Yen on Monday after Abe promised to move ahead with a plethora of major constitutional reforms following his party's landslide win in the closely-watched upper-house elections. As part of his plans, the Japanese prime minister unveiled a ¥10 Trillion ($98 billion) stimulus measure aimed at jumpstarting the economy, including a proposal to fast-track construction on a series of high-speed trains throughout the nation.
While the Nikkei 225 soared 601.84 or 3.98% to 15,708.82, the yen plummeted against its major rivals in Monday's session, nearly erasing all of its post-Brexit gains. It comes amid heavy speculation that former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke has plans on crafting a strategy with Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda to bring ""helicopter money"" to Japan. While a Reuters source reportedly spotted Bernanke at the Japanese Central Bank on Monday, Reuters was unable to confirm if the former head of the U.S. central bank met with Kuroda or Abe. In an alternative to Quantitative Easing, a central bank can print large sums of helicopter money and distribute it to the public as a means for stimulating the economy.
Elsewhere, further gains in the dollar were restrained by political developments in the U.K. after prime minister David Cameron announced he will officially step down from his position on Wednesday when Theresa May will be appointed as his successor. The announcement came hours after Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the PM campaign, leaving May as the lone remaining candidate to head the Conservative Party. While many economists are hopeful that May's appointment could bolster Britain's chances of gaining access to the European Union's single market, there is still uncertainty whether it could help limit the fallout from last month's surprising Brexit referendum. On Monday,  Deutsche Bank 's (DE:DBKGn) chief economist advised the European Commission to set aside up to 150 billion euros in an emergency fund to help recapitalize struggling banks throughout the euro area.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.40% to an intraday high of 96.81 before falling back to 96.58 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading. Although the dollar has rebounded sharply since the historic Brexit referendum, the index is still down more than 3% since early-December.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rallied seven basis points to 1.43%, while yields on the UK 10-Year rose two basis points to 0.76%. Over the last year, yields on both 10-year government bonds have plunged more than 95 basis points."

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2016 08:15AM ET</span>",Yen tumbles against resurgent dollar on hopes of more stimulus,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar climbed almost 2 percent against the yen on Monday following a surge in Japan's stock market, after the country's ruling coalition won a clear victory in upper house elections, fuelling expectations of more monetary stimulus. 
The dollar hit a four-month high against a basket of major currencies (DXY), having already been given a lift by a bumper U.S. jobs report on Friday which saw investors price back in the chance of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. 
Japan's Nikkei stock average closed up 4 percent after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's victory. He is expected to tighten his grip on the conservative party, which he led back to power in 2012 promising to revive the economy with hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms - a programme known as ""Abenonics"".
The dollar rose as much as 1.9 percent on the day to 102.48 yen , its biggest one-day rise in almost three months. It fell as low as 99 yen on June 24 in the aftermath of Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union, which drove investors to the Japanese currency and other safe havens.
""The election result has taken away some of the appetite for selling at the levels we'd got down to - 100 was a big level and I think for the markets to push through that there would have to be some escalation of developments that would really push risk aversion higher,"" said Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ currency strategist Derek Halpenny, in London. 
In Frankfurt, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Thulan Nguyen said Abe's promise of further fiscal stimulus, which would necessitate an expansion of monetary stimulus in order to keep bond yields down and shore up inflation, was driving down the yen. 
U.S. job creation in June was much stronger than expected at 287,000, easing fears that the labour market may be faltering. Though the core view is still that interest rates will stay where they are, a 24 percent chance of a Fed hike by December is now being priced in, according to CME FedWatch.
""The data was likely strong enough to reduce concerns that weak job creation in April and May was signalling the beginning of a much more severe contraction or even recession in the United States,"" wrote  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) strategists in a note to clients. 
Sterling reversed earlier losses to turn positive on the day after Theresa May emerged as the only remaining candidate to lead Britain's ruling Conservative Party and become prime minister, after rival Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race .

Later Monday, finance ministers from the euro zone are to hold a meeting in Brussels and Kansas Fed chief Esther George is to speak at an event in Missouri.
China reported that the pace of gains in the Consumer Price Index moderated further to 1.9% year-on-year in June because of mainly weaker gains in food prices and at the slowest pace since January, when the National Bureau of Statistics changed the weighting of the basket of goods that make up the index.
Food prices rose 4.6% year-on-year in June, down from a 5.9% increase in May and 7.4% jump in April. Pork prices, the biggest driver of consumer inflation in the past few months, rose by 30.1% year-on-year, down from 33.6% year-on-year in May.

USD/JPY traded at 100.72, up 0.13%, while AUD/USD traded at 0.7542, down 0.40%. GBP/USD was down 0.13% to 1.2935.
In Australia, home loans data for May fell 1.0%, less than the 2.0% drop seen in May month-on-month, along with housing finance figures that rose 3.9% for the same month, reversing a 5.0% decline in April.
Earlier, in Japan, core machinery orders for May slumped 11.7%, sharply more than the 8.7% decline seen year-on-year.
Later Monday, finance ministers from the euro zone are to hold a meeting in Brussels and Kansas Fed chief Esther George is to speak at an event in Missouri.
China reported that the pace of gains in the Consumer Price Index moderated further to 1.9% year-on-year in June because of mainly weaker gains in food prices and at the slowest pace since January, when the National Bureau of Statistics changed the weighting of the basket of goods that make up the index.
Food prices rose 4.6% year-on-year in June, down from a 5.9% increase in May and 7.4% jump in April. Pork prices, the biggest driver of consumer inflation in the past few months, rose by 30.1% year-on-year, down from 33.6% year-on-year in May.
The data suggests that China is in a sustained period of moderate inflation even as Worries about deflation have dissipated, making it less likely that the People's Bank of China will resort to aggressive monetary easing to support the economy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.10% to 96.41.
Last week, the dollar ended broadly lower against the other major currencies on Friday as prospects for another interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year remained dim despite a much stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report for June.
The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 287,000 jobs last month, well above the 175,000 jobs forecast by economists.Average hourly earnings were up 2.6% compared with a year earlier.
But the report also showed that the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.9% and May’s payrolls figure was revised down to 11,000 from a previously reported 38,000, the smallest monthly increase since 2010.
The strong jobs report was seen as unlikely to alter the Fed’s cautious plans for raising interest rates.
But the outlook for the pound remained to the downside ahead of what will be a closely watched monetary policy announcement by the Bank of England on Thursday. The Bank of Canada is also to hold a monetary policy meeting in the coming week, with no changes to monetary policy expected.

1467,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 06:52PM ET</span>","GBP/USD posts rare win, as dollar wavers after stellar jobs report","Investing.com -- GBP/USD posted modest gains on Friday to post a rare winning session, as the dollar wavered throughout a choppy day of trading after reports showed that the U.S. labor market added the highest number of jobs in June in nearly 10 months.
The currency pair wavered between 1.2881 and 1.3018, before settling at 1.2952, up 0.0046 or 0.36% on the session. With the slight gains, the British Pound recorded just its fourth winning session since voters in the U.K. surprisingly backed a referendum last month paving the way for a departure from the E.U. Since eclipsing 1.50 in the hours before the final vote was tallied, the Pound has tumbled nearly 13% over the last two weeks. On Wednesday, the Pound Sterling extended previous losses against the Dollar to slide below 1.28 for the first time in 31 years.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payrolls rose by 287,000 in June, defying expectations for an increase of 180,000 and posting the highest monthly gains in eight months. The struggling labor market demonstrated broad signs of improvement last month following downwardly revised gains of 11,000 in May, providing indications that the weak hiring period in late-Spring could have been an anomaly. Nevertheless, the three-month moving average fell sharply to 147,300, in line with the Fed's expectations, down from 195,700 over the first quarter.
Within the report, the gains were concentrated in leisure and hospitality, health care and social assistance and financial assistance. The leisure and hospitality category added 58,000 positions for the month after remaining relatively flat in May. The telecommunications industry also experienced a snapback, adding 28,000 positions as thousands of Verizon workers returned to work following a labor dispute the previous month. At the same time, the struggling manufacturing sector reported a rare gain, adding 14,000 jobs on the month. Notably, approximately 90% of the job increases in June went to workers aged 55 or above.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose moderately by 0.2 to 4.9%, remaining below the Fed's objective of 5%, while the labor force participation rate inched up by 0.1 to 62.7%. The U-6 Unemployment Rate, which measures workers who are marginally attached to the labor force and are no longer looking for full-time work, fell 0.1 on the month to a seasonally-adjusted 9.6%. By comparison, the Fed's preferred gauge for unemployment, stood at 10.5% a year ago at this time and peaked at 18.0% at the height of the Great Recession.
Earlier this week, the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) June meeting depicted a divided Fed on the long-term outlook for future interest rate hikes. At last month's FOMC monetary policy meeting, participants cited a slowing labor market and the threat of a British exit from the EU as main factors for holding interest rates steady. While  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said on Friday there is a 66% chance the Fed could raise interest rates this year, Fed futures rates from the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) were still drastically lower following the report.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, hit a session-high of 96.71 before falling back to 96.31 at the close, down 0.02% on the session.

In addition, U.S. Payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose 172,000 last month, above forecasts for an increase of 159,000.
Sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable however after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers agreed that it was “prudent to wait” for additional data before considering another rate hike.
Sterling was also higher against the euro, with EUR/GBP slipping 0.13% to 0.8557.

USD/JPY slid 0.34% to trade at 100.43, re-approaching recent 30-month lows of 99.08.
Market participants were still speculating whether or not the Bank of Japan will soon introduce fresh easing measures to boost the economy.
BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday that the central bank was ready to expand monetary stimulus further if needed to achieve its 2% inflation target and affirmed his confidence over Japan's recovery prospects, making no mention of the current Brexit turmoil.
Earlier Friday, official data showed that Japan’s adjusted current account surplus narrowed to ¥1.41 trillion in May from ¥1.63 trillion the previous month. Analysts had expected the current account surplus to narrow to ¥1.52 trillion in May.

Investors' risk sentiment also slipped with the safe-haven yen firmer after news that four police officers were fatally shot and seven wounded by snipers who targeted them during rallies in Dallas to protest against the fatal shootings of two black men by police this week.
The consensus forecast is for the U.S. economy to have added 175,000 jobs in June, according to a Reuters poll, but investors remain wary given the negative surprise in the May payrolls report, which some expect to be upwardly revised.
A report overnight showed U.S. private payrolls rose more than expected in June and jobless claims were lower than forecast.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was down 0.2 percent at 96.091 (DXY). But it was still poised for a 0.5 percent gain in a week marked by volatile trade in the wake of Britain's surprise vote to exit the European Union last month. 
The perceived safe-haven yen firmed, indicating that investors remained wary ahead of the payrolls report.
""I think many investors want to continue to focus on the Brexit risks, so even if we get some good U.S. employment data, it might not be so helpful to over come weak sentiment,"" said Masashi Murata, currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.
""My basic scenario is that dollar/yen will trade between 100 and 105 through the end of September,"" he said.
The dollar was 0.3 percent lower against the yen  at 100.45 yen, though still holding above its post-Brexit low of 99 yen hit on June 24. It was down 2 percent for the week.
Investors also pondered whether the Bank of Japan will decide to take further stimulus action at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on July 29, and what form such steps might take.
""Cutting rates is one of the key options the BOJ may look to when it eases policy next,"" strategists at Nomura wrote in a note. 
""After its adoption on 29 January, its negative rate policy has not succeeded in improving investor sentiment, as concerns over the negative impact on bank earnings were highlighted more than its benefits,"" they said. 
The euro inched 0.1 percent lower to 111.34 yen (EURJPY=R), moving back toward a 3 1/2-year low of 109.30 logged after the Brexit vote. It was poised to shed 2.6 percent for the week.
The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.1083 , but was down 0.5 percent for the week.
Recently battered sterling was up 0.3 percent at $1.2948 , holding above 31-year lows logged earlier this week though still down about 2.5 percent for the week. 

But some analysts expect it to drop to as low as $1.20 in coming months as the Bank of England prepares to ease monetary policy to blunt the impact of the Brexit move.

1478,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 07, 2016 06:11PM ET</span>","GBP/USD ticks down, as economists push for swift Brexit resolution","Investing.com -- GBP/USD remained near 31-year lows paring slight gains late in Thursday's session, as leading economists and analysts urged the U.K. to act expeditiously to resolve key trade differences with partners throughout the European Union in the wake of last month's Brexit decision. 
The currency pair traded at 1.2914 at the close of U.S. afternoon session (down 0.05 or 0.13%), capping a frenzied day of trading when the Pound briefly nudged above 1.30 at session-highs. The Pound Sterling extended losses from Wednesday's session when it fell below 1.28 against the U.S. Dollar for the first time since 1985. Since polls closed in the historic Brexit referendum two weeks ago, the Pound has tumbled more than 12% against its American counterpart. 
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.2796, the low from July 6 and was met with resistance at 1.3535, the high from June 30. 
Earlier, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said in an interview with the Financial Times that the U.K. could soften the effects of the Brexit decision by agreeing to a deal that would grant it access to the European Union's single market, while complying with the bloc's laws on freedom of movement. A swift resolution could reduce Britain's GDP growth by only 1.5% through 2019, Lagarde said. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz (DE:ALVG), also cautioned on Thursday that the British Pound could hit parity with the U.S. Dollar if leaders in the U.K. fail to develop an alternative plan that provides businesses nationwide with a free trade agreement with members of the bloc. 
""After the Brexit referendum, the UK has to urgently get its political act together, including a new Prime Minister who can negotiate effectively with the EU. Plan B depends on the politicians in London and across the Channel, but so far they have not stepped up to their economic governance responsibilities,"" El-Erian told Reuters. 
On Friday, investors will turn their attention to a critical June U.S. jobs report for signs of recovery in the slumping labor market. In May, nonfarm payrolls rose by 38,000, the lowest monthly increase in nearly six years. Analysts expect that the report from the U.S. Department of Labor will show monthly job gains of 180,000, its highest total in three months. Economists expect a rebound following the return of approximately 35,000 Verizon workers, which were on strike in June during a labor dispute. 
As a prelude, ADP said in its monthly employment report on Thursday that nonfarm payrolls rose by 172,000 in June, above May's revised total of 168,000 and considerably higher than consensus estimates of 150,000. While Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has emphasized the importance of not placing an undue amount of weight on a single report, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) characterized the slowing labor market as a factor for holding interest rates steady at its monetary policy meeting last month. Prior to the disappointing report, Yellen said at a speech at Harvard University in late-May that it could be appropriate to raise interest rates in the coming months. Since then, the FOMC lowered its long-term rate outlook while markets have taken a 2016 rate hike off the table entirely.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.20% to an intraday high of 96.35 before inching down to 96.33 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading. Although the index is up by more than 2.5% since the Brexit referendum, it is still down by approximately 4% from its December highs.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained two basis points to 1.38%, while yields on the U.K. 10-Year also rose two basis points to 0.78%. Over the last month, yields on both 10-year government bonds have fallen by more than 20 basis points.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2016 11:40AM ET</span>",Sterling's post-Brexit fall is biggest loss in a hard currency,"By Jamie McGeever
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling's slump since Britain voted to leave the European Union is the biggest drop of any of the world's four major currencies that make up the bulk of global hard cash reserves since the collapse of Bretton Woods.
The pound's 8-percent fall against the dollar on June 24 was its biggest one-day fall since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced in the early 1970s, Reuters data shows. That loss has extended to as much as 13 percent since.
That was nearly double the 4.3 percent decline on Sept. 16, 1992, when billionaire financier George Soros famously ""broke the Bank of England"" after his bets against the pound were instrumental in its ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
For comparison, the euro's biggest one-day fall against the dollar was 2.75 percent on 24 October, 2008, and the Japanese yen's was 6 percent on both 7 January, 1974, and 28 October, 2008. 
The trade-weighted dollar's worst day was 13 February, 1973, when it fell 4.8 percent, according to Reuters data. 
The unprecedented nature of the pound's fall and the widespread expectations of further losses since the June 23 referendum cast a pall over all foreign holdings of UK assets not already hedged in advance.
""It is unprecedented. If you have this kind of systemic shock with a current account deficit like Britain's of nearly 7 pct of GDP it's like a trap door under the currency,"" said Mike Ingram, market analyst at BGC Partners in London.
Sterling has lost around 13 percent of its value against the dollar since the vote, changing hands at $1.28 this week for the first time since June 1985. 
That's on a par with the 13 percent fall over 10 trading days between 30 October and 13 November, 1998, in the aftermath of the Russian crisis and the bank bailout of U.S. hedge management fund Long-Term Capital Management.
It fell 12 percent in the 11 trading days between 8-23 January, 2009 and 16 percent in the 11 trading days spanning 8-23 September, 2009, in the 2008-9 height of the financial crisis.
The euro's biggest loss against the dollar over a two-week period was around 8 percent in October 2008 when there was a worldwide scramble for dollars. 
The yen's heaviest two-week selloff was its near-8 percent decline in January 1988, Reuters data shows, and the dollar index's heaviest two-week slump was also just shy of 8 percent in March 1985.
The yen is traditionally more volatile than sterling, and both are far more prone to sharp intraday price swings than the euro or dollar. 
Below are two tables tracking how rare sharp moves in ""G4"" currencies have been since the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates established after World War Two ended.
Data on the euro go back to its launch in 1999, or based on its constituent currencies before its introduction.

1481,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 07, 2016 10:31AM ET</span>","Sterling totters on the edge, experts only disagree on depth of abyss","Investing.com – Though the shock decision by the U.K. to leave the European Union (EU), known as a Brexit, sent the pound tumbling to 31-year lows against the dollar, experts continue to predict a further leg-down for cable with some even warning that parity could be on the horizon.
The why behind “31-year lows” on a daily basis
Financial market headlines are ripe with references of GBP/USD hitting new 31-year lows on almost a daily basis.
To put that in perspective, it should be clear that each move beyond the prior low will be a fresh trough back to those self-same lowest levels since 1985.
This is simply because, at the height of the mid-80s sterling crisis, cable dropped in February 1985 to a low of $1.05.
Trading briefly above $1.30 on Thursday, the pound has a long drop to reach that point and only by taking out that level will cable have a new record low.
Further downside risks
Experts have been busy lowering forecasts after the Brexit victory in the June 23 referendum with many pointing to the political uncertainty surrounding the selection of a new Prime Minister expected to be decided on September 9 along with the posterior negotiations on a trade agreement and expected easing from the Bank of England (BoE).
Analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown crunched the numbers on interest-rate swaps in London markets and said the probability of rate cut at next Thursday’s BoE meeting was 78%.
Odds of a reduction by August were at 86% with a 27% chance that rates will be at 0% (from the current record low of 0.50%).
By the December meeting, the probability of a cut rose to 89% with a 34% chance of them being at 0% and an 8% of rates being negative.
“Initially August had looked more likely, but with economic data deteriorating and markets still nervous, it now looks probable the Monetary Policy Committee will adjudge that immediate action is warranted,” they said.
BNP Paribas also believes that the central bank meeting will be the next leg-down for sterling.
“In our view the market is still likely underpricing BoE easing, with our economists forecasting a 25 basis point (bp) rate cut next week followed by a 25bp cut at the August meeting and £100 billion worth of quantitative easing (including corporate bonds) to be announced by the November meeting,” they said.
“Lower rates and reduced (foreign direct investment) should leave the GBP vulnerable for some time to come,” they added.
Forecasts slashed
“The pound is now clearly seen as a high risk asset and when market sentiment becomes very risk averse, it will come under pressure,” experts from HiFX pointed out.
A large number of analysts have cut their forecasts for cable with varying degrees of bearish in their calls.
In a less bearish stance JP Morgan said cable would drop only to $1.29 in September before staging a recovery to end the year at $1.30 and continue the reversal up to $1.33 by June 2017.
In a middle-ground stance, Danske Bank predicts a drop to $1.22 in three to six months’ time with a recovery to $1.30 in a year.
Goldman Sachs forecast that the pound will hit $1.20 in the next 3 months as the BoE is forced to take action, with a recovery to $1.21 and $1.25 in the next 6 and 12 months, respectively.
Citigroup was looking for a drop to $1.20 as the BoE embarks on easing, while the bank’s head of European currency strategy told Bloomberg Television that “the question is ‘how quick do we get there?’”
HSBC set $1.20 as its target for the end of the year, in contrast to those analysts expecting a recovery after September.
UniCredit was among the most bearish with a projection that cable could fall to $1.20 or below due to potential easing by the BoE, an upcoming recession in the British economy and some reversal of foreign direct investment.
Deutsche Bank was perhaps the most bearish call, putting the forecast at $1.15 in a report where these analysts added that the target “may be understating” the decline. However, that did not mean that there weren’t others going so far as to warn that the pound could be in danger of falling as far as parity with the dollar.
Allianz economist Mohamed El-Erian warned that British politicians were failing in their responsibility to provide a swift and credible “Plan B” that would include a free trade agreement with Europe.
“The future value of sterling is a function of how and how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved – if Plan B is delayed and/or it doesn't involve much of a free trade set-up with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the U.S. dollar,” he warned."

USD/CAD hit 1.2890 during early U.S. trade, the pair’s lowest since Tuesday; the pair subsequently consolidated at 1.2898, sliding 0.50%.
The pair was likely to find support at 1.2826, the low of July 4 and resistance at 1.3056, Wednesday’s high.
Oil prices moved back higher on Thursday amid speculation weekly supply data due later in the session will show U.S. crude inventories fell at a faster pace than expected last week.
In Canada, official data showed that building permits dropped 1.9% in May, compared to expectations for an increase of 2.0%. Building permits inched up 0.1% in April, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated 0.3% slip.
At the same time, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 2 decreased by 16,000 to 254,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 270,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 270,000 last week.
The report came after U.S. Payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose 172,000 last month, above forecasts for an increase of 159,000. The economy created 168,000 jobs in May, whose figure was upwardly revised from a previously reported increase of 173,000.
But the greenback’s gains were capped after the minutes of the Fed’s June policy meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers decided to keep interest rate hikes on hold as they assessed the Brexit impact.

The British pound is catching its breath after non-stop hemorrhaging over the last two weeks post-Brexit.

Moreover, industrial production fell by 0.5% month-over-month in May, better than the forecasted 1.0% drop, and the Halifax House Price Index rose 1.3% month-over-month in June, above expectations of a 0.4% increase.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2016 11:37PM ET</span>","Australian dollar sags on S&P outlook cut, yen firms","TOKYO (Reuters) - The Australian dollar withered after Standard and Poor's cut the outlook for that country's credit rating to negative on Thursday, while the safe-haven yen firmed in the fallout from Britain's vote last month to exit the European Union.
The Aussie  fell as low as $0.7467, from an earlier session high of $0.7539, after S&P downgraded the outlook on Australia's AAA credit rating to negative from stable. But the currency pared losses to last buy $0.7507, down 0.1 percent on the day.
The ratings agency had warned that deadlock on government policy after Saturday's inconclusive elections could endanger Australia's rating over the long run. 
A Reuters poll taken ahead of S&P's move showed that analysts had raised their outlooks for the Australian and New Zealand dollars due to those countries' relatively high bond rates and the British pound's recent plunge.
The euro slipped 0.5 percent to 111.92 yen (EURJPY=R), but managed to hold above its Wednesday low of 110.84 and a 3 1/2-year low of 109.30 logged soon after the results of the Brexit referendum were apparent. 
The dollar shed 0.4 percent to 100.95 yen , though it also remained above the previous session's low of 100.20 as well as its June 24 nadir of 99.000 hit after the UK's vote.
""There's a lot of nervousness. Post-Brexit issues are starting to sink in,"" said Jeff Kravetz, senior investment strategist at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Scottsdale, Arizona. 
""The yen has been a big story. It keeps strengthening as a safe-haven currency,"" he said, adding that the dollar might break under 100 yen again against the backdrop of uncertainty.
Sharp yen gains are usually followed by verbal warnings from Japanese financial officials, one of whom said on Wednesday that the finance ministry was closely watching the currency market to see if any speculative factors were behind market moves.
According to Japan Macro Advisors' probability model of the risk of direct foreign exchange intervention, the dollar's fall to 95 yen could be a trigger point in the next 2 months, while from September onward, the threshold would shift to 90 yen. 
""The Japanese yen is appreciating from an extremely weak level and the yen has to appreciate much further before Japan could gain an implicit approval from other G7 countries,"" said Takuji Okubo, chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors.
""Past episodes of intervention suggest a unilateral intervention without implicit approval from other G7 tends to be ineffective,"" Okubo said in a note.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday that the central bank is ready to expand monetary stimulus further if needed to achieve its 2 percent inflation target, but he made no mention of the Brexit vote that has spread turmoil in financial markets.
Beleaguered sterling fell as low as 128.81 yen (GBPJPY=R) on Wednesday, its lowest since November 2012. It was last down 0.2 percent at 130.70. 
The pound had skidded to $1.2798  in the previous session to log a fresh 31-year low, but was last up 0.1 percent at $1.2939.
Sterling remains under pressure despite the efforts of Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who has attempted to calm investors roiled by Brexit with an unusually explicit signal that the Bank was poised to pump more stimulus into the economy in the coming months.
""People are still selling into sterling rallies, whenever it rises on any of the crosses,"" said Kaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo.
""The BOE might come up with some supportive measures,"" he said.
The BOE's next interest rate decision will come on July 14, though economists polled by Reuters mostly predicted that the central bank would wait to cut interest rates until its meeting on Aug. 4, when it will likely have a clearer idea about Brexit's impact.
Fanning fears of financial contagion in the wake of the Brexit vote, the number of British property funds suspended in recent weeks doubled to six on Wednesday, leaving 15 billion pounds ($19.37 billion) frozen in the biggest seizing up of investment funds since the 2008 financial crisis.
Minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's June policy meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers decided to keep interest rate hikes on hold as they assessed the Brexit impact. 
The dollar was lifted overnight when Institute for Supply Management data revealed that growth in the U.S. economy's service sector increased in June at its fastest pace in seven months.
Investors awaited the key U.S. non-farm payrolls numbers due on Friday, which are expected to show employers added 180,000 jobs last month, according to a preliminary Reuters poll. That would follow May's surprisingly weak reading of just 38,000, which some economists expect to be revised upward.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2016 10:30PM ET</span>","Analysts nudge up forecasts for Australia, New Zealand dollars: Reuters poll","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Analysts have nudged up their outlook for the Australian and New Zealand dollars as relatively high bond rates at home and a plunge in the British pound made the Antipodean currencies more attractive to yield-hungry investors.
A Reuters poll of 55 analysts saw the Aussie  at $0.7300 in one month, a cent higher than in the June poll. Still, the general expectations was that it would ease over time reaching $0.7200 in three months and $0.7000 in a year.
The market, however, seemed more bullish given the Aussie was trading at $0.7517 on Thursday. It has been in demand since Britain's vote to leave the European Union pummelled the pound and intensified pressure for new policy easing across the globe.
Sterling has dived 12 percent on the Aussie since the vote to reach A$1.7187 (GBPAUD=), levels last seen in late 2013.
Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are now expected to ease further while the market no longer sees any chance of a hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve this year.
That sea change has offset expectations the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will cut its own rates a quarter point to 1.5 percent in coming months, likely in August.
Australia likewise offers bond yields well above those available from its rich world peers. Ten-year paper (AU10YT=RR) pays 1.87 percent against 1.36 percent in the United States, 0.76 percent in the UK and -0.17 percent in Germany.
The same forces are seen supporting the New Zealand dollar . The poll of 49 analysts produced a one-month forecast of $0.7000, up from $0.6700 in the June poll. It was seen at $0.6800 in three months and $0.6500 on a one-year horizon.
Again, the market is more upbeat having taken the kiwi to $0.7162 currently from as low as $0.6676 as recently as May.

In Australia, the AIG construction index for June jumped to 53.2, marking a leap into expansion territory from 46.7 the previous month.
AUD/USD traded at 0.7512, down 0.12%, while USD/JPY changed hands at 101.14, down 0.18% and GBP held at more than three decade lows, down 0.14% at 1.2914.
AI head of policy Peter Burn said the residential sub-sectors were the standout performers both in current activity and in new orders, suggesting they are on track to continue their expansionary run over the near term. ""While making positive contributions to current activity, the commercial and engineering construction sub-sectors both recorded a drop in new orders in June, providing less cause for optimism about the first quarter of the new financial year,"" he added.
HIA chief economist Harley Dale said the results serve as a reminder that new residential construction remains the powerhouse of the domestic Australian economy. ""At the same time, non-residential construction has some spark to it, but the breadth of recovery is still proving elusive,"" Dale said.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.15% to 96.13.
Earlier, minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting showed caution on the path of rate hikes going forward, while noting inflation bears watching.
Overnight, the dollar moved back higher against the other major currencies on Wednesday, after the release of strong U.S. service sector activity data and as concerns over the global ramifications of the Brexit vote continued to support demand for safer assets.
The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index rose to an eight-month high of 56.5 last month from 52.9 in May. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 53.3.

At session-lows, the British Pound fell to 1.2797 against the U.S. Dollar, tumbling below 1.28 for the first time since 1985. The Pound Sterling rallied several hours later to re-test the 1.30 level, before closing the U.S. afternoon session at 1.2961, down 0.0029 or 0.25%. Since eclipsing 1.50 in the final hours before Brexit polls closed on June 23, GBP/USD has tumbled more than 13%. Days earlier, billionaire investor George Soros warned that the Pound could crash as much as 20% if the Leave campaign prevailed.
Investor sentiment toward the Pound remained weak on Wednesday after Henderson and Columbia Thread Needle became the latest major U.K. property funds to halt redemptions, citing exceptional liquidity pressures in the wake of the Brexit vote. It followed similar moves by M&G Property Portfolio,  Aviva  (LON:AV) and  Standard Life  (LON:SL) in recent days. In total, leading U.K. commercial property funds have locked up approximately £13 billion in investments, according to The Guardian. The actions exacerbate fears that commercial property values nationwide will fall precipitously if the U.K. decides to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, triggering a two-year formal process to leave the European Union. 
Meanwhile, market players continued to pile into safe-haven assets such as Gold, government bonds and the Japanese Yen, amid extreme volatility throughout global financial markets. Yields on the 10-Year U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. 30-Year fell to intraday lows of 1.321 and 2.098% respectively, each touching down to all-time lows. In Denmark, yields on the Danish 10-Year fell below zero for the first time on record, while yields on the Swedish 10-Year inched down to 0.101 after the Riksbank cautioned that it could lower rates deeper into negative territory over the next two years.
The Dollar remained relatively unchanged against the Pound after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released the minutes from its last meeting on June 14-15. According to the minutes, the Committee felt it would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the historic Brexit referendum eight days later in order to ""assess the consequences"" of the vote on global financial markets. At the same time, most participants noted that a potential Brexit ""could generate financial market turbulence,"" that could adversely impact U.S. domestic economic performance in the months ahead.
While Fed officials remained divided on the timing of their next rate hike, most participants judged that conditions could be appropriate for further tightening if economic growth picked up, the labor market showed improvement and inflation moved closer to its 2% goal. Notably, Fed governor Daniel Tarullo said earlier on Wednesday that the Fed could avoid raising rates until inflation hits its targeted objective.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, hit an intraday high of 96.62, before falling to 96.13 (down 0.15%) at the close of U.S. afternoon trading.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2016 06:36AM ET</span>",Yen soars as Brexit jitters boost safe-haven flows,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen soared to a 3-1/2 year high against the struggling British pound on Wednesday on growing fears about the broader impact on financial markets and the global economy of Britain's vote to quit the European Union.
Sterling was down 1.8 percent against the yen (GBPJPY=), hitting its lowest level since late 2012, as investors sought safe-haven assets such as highly rated government bonds. 
The pound also hit a 31-year low against the dollar at $1.2798  as fears of foreign outflows and Bank of England rate cuts hit the currency hard. It recovered from those lows, but was still down 0.5 percent at $1.2960. 
The dollar fell 1.2 percent to 100.49 yen , moving close to the June 24 trough of 99 yen, struck in the wake of the Brexit referendum vote when nerves were still raw.
""Risk sentiment is bad and that is seeing the yen, the traditional safe-haven, gain,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. ""We think the momentum is towards a lower dollar/yen given all the Brexit worries.""
Expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep U.S. rates lower for longer was also weighing on the dollar, especially against the yen. Influential Fed policymaker William Dudley suggested on Tuesday that broad contagion through financial markets was a risk, particularly if the vote leads to instability in the European Union.
Fears of contagion intensified after three UK property funds stopped redemptions, which spooked investors and sent them scurrying into the safety of government bonds. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank to a record low of 1.3210 percent (US10YT=RR) on Wednesday while German Bund 10-year yields went deeper into negative territory. 
EURO ALSO STRUGGLING
It was just not the British pound that was struggling, with the euro also under pressure as investors worried that a Brexit would dampen fledging growth prospects in the euro zone.
Adding to a growing sense of market instability, shares in Italian banks, which are suffocating under a pile of non-performing loans, extended losses. Other European bank shares also fell, pulling down the broader stock index. (EU)
The euro retreated below 111 yen (EURJPY=R) for the first time in over a week, to a low of 110.96 and holding just above its June 24 low of 109.30. It was last down 1.4 percent at 111.05 yen and 0.15 percent lower against the dollar at $1.1058 .
""We suspect the dollar and yen should benefit the most from the euro-centric nature of the Brexit shock, leaving European currencies to underperform these safe havens but also other currencies with stronger credit ratings,"" said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of currency strategy at TD Securities.   
The euro climbed against the Swedish crown (EURSEK=D4) after the Riksbank kept interest rates unchanged, as expected, and flagged considerable economic uncertainty from the British referendum. It inched up to 9.4665 crowns (EURSEK=D4), having traded at 9.4400 beforehand.

At session-lows, the British Pound dropped to 1.2997 against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, extending losses from the immediate aftermath of the Brexit-inspired market shock and falling to its lowest level since 1985. Since eclipsing 1.50 in the final hours before polls closed in U.K. voting on June 23, the Pound has plummeted more than 11% against its American counterpart. Over the same period, the Pound has also slumped more than 10% versus the euro.
On a volatile day of trading, GBP/USD reached session-highs of 1.3283. At the close of U.S. trading, the currency pair traded at 1.3028, down 0.0252 or 1.89% on the session.
In London, Bank of England governor Mark Carney cautioned investors that the risks related to the Brexit vote are ""starting to crystallize,"" less than two weeks after the historic decision. While the BOE announced new rules that will ease capital restrictions on domestic lenders possibly freeing up as much as £150 billion in added liquidity, Carney warned that the bank will not be able to fully offset the expected economic and market volatility that could ensue over the next several months.
Shortly after, a host of leading British property funds suspended trading, amid heightened fears that commercial property values nationwide will fall precipitously if the U.K. eventually decides to depart from the European Union.  Aviva  (LON:AV), a British savings and investment group, halted trading on Tuesday, one day after  Standard Life  (LON:SL) became the first firm to freeze its property fund. In addition, M&G's Property Portfolio, Britain's largest commercial property fund, also halted redemptions on Tuesday following a rash of rapid cash outflows.
Elsewhere, currency traders await the release of Friday's highly-anticipated U.S. monthly jobs report for further indications on the strength of the domestic labor market. In May, nonfarm payrolls rose by 38,000, marking the lowest increase in U.S. monthly employment in nearly six years. Analysts expect to see consensus gains of 180,000 in June, an amount which would represent the highest monthly increase in three months.
A strong employment report could convince dovish members of the Federal Reserve to accelerate its timetable for tightening its monetary policy cycle. Last month, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to leave the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a range between 0.25 and 0.50%. Notably, the FOMC also lowered its long-term interest outlook through the end of 2018.
Any rate hikes from the FOMC are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
Meanwhile, yields on the U.S. 10-Year and U.S. 30-Year fell to intraday lows of 1.357% and 2.131% respectively, each dropping to their lowest levels on record. It came as investors continue to pile into safe-haven assets such as government bonds, Gold and the U.S. dollar to hedge against widespread market volatility.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 96.46, before falling slightly back to 96.27 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading. While the index is up by more than 2.5% since the Brexit referendum, it is still down by approximately 4% from its December highs."
1504,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 12:20PM ET</span>",Latam currencies seen resisting global volatility: Reuters poll,"By Gabriel Burin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Latin American currencies will likely hold their ground in the face of global volatility, but remain exposed to domestic fiscal problems as well as uncertainty over the outcome of the U.S. election later this year, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
The median estimate for Brazil's currency  in 12 months was 3.75 per dollar, 1.9 percent stronger than in June's outlook. The Chilean peso  and the Peruvian sol  also had stable or better forecasts.
The Brazilian real gained 11 percent in June to its highest in almost a year as the central bank signaled it would hold interest rates at a whopping 14.25 percent for longer than expected to battle high inflation.
Market players had expected Brazil to start cutting interest rates soon to help the country recover from its worst recession in decades. But newly appointed central bank head Ilan Goldfajn surprised investors last month by suggesting the benchmark rate would stay unchanged for months to come.
""The more hawkish tone from the Brazilian central bank, indicating the delay of the monetary policy easing, benefits the real in the short term,"" analysts at JP Morgan wrote.
Brazil's large fiscal gap remains a threat for the real, though. Haitong Securities economist Flavio Serrano said he could downgrade his estimates for the currency unless there were signs of improvement in the country's public accounts.
""Fiscal risks should generate at least some premium on the exchange rate,"" Serrano said. Brazil posted its largest-ever primary budget deficit for the month of May. The shortfall is expected to hit 170.5 billion reais ($53.52 billion) in 2016.
Interim President Michel Temer's plans to bring the deficit down next year have calmed investors' worries. But the success of his austerity drive is far from assured, requiring Congressional approval of unpopular legislation in a country roiled by political strife and corruption scandals.
Opposing the brighter picture for the real, the median projection for the Mexican peso tumbled 4.0 percent to 18.2250 in one year. Estimates were compiled before Mexico's central bank hiked its rate by 50 basis points last Thursday.
The move by Banxico, as the bank is known, sought to shore up the peso, which sank 5.8 percent in the second quarter as Brexit fears hit Latin America's most heavily traded currency. The peso picked up after the hike and has stabilized.
Following the first shock waves after Britons' voted to leave the European Union, and with the U.S. Federal Reserve increasingly forced to the sidelines on rates, Juan Carlos Alderete at Banorte-Ixe, said: ""what could be complicated for the peso is the U.S. election.""
""You must protect yourself because ... the probability that (Donald) Trump wins is not low,"" he added, referring to the presumptive U.S. Republican presidential nominee. The view fits with a bearish stance among speculative investors. 
Leveraged funds had a net position of 49,542 short contracts for the peso as of June 28, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This was below the record for this year of 52,520 but well above the average of 29,650.

Trump's vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs has added an extra layer of unease to Mexican markets this year. His stated plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement could also affect Mexico's economic prospects.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 11:10AM ET</span>",More Brexit pain seen for pound; Bank of England to cut rates: Reuters poll,"By Ross Finley and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England will probably wait until August to make any policy move to offset the hit to the economy from Britain's decision to leave the European Union, but the pound has more pain ahead, a Reuters polls showed on Tuesday.
Governor Mark Carney has said the economy faces a material slowdown after the shock referendum result and the BoE took steps on Tuesday to encourage banks keep lending.
One Reuters poll showed sterling - which sank to a new 31-year low against the dollar on Tuesday - would probably weaken by a further 3 percent on top of the 12 percent drop already since the June 23 vote, less than two weeks ago.
Reuters polls before the referendum predicted a significant slide in sterling as well as the kind of economic pain that the BoE is bracing for with its abrupt shift in stance. 
After spending most of first three years at the Bank trying to signal when the BoE was likely to raise rates, Carney last week suggested more stimulus was likely over the summer as the referendum result raised fears of a possible recession. 
But it is debatable how much impact an additional cut to rates, which are already at a record low of 0.50 percent, will have on an economy facing lower investment, spending and potential trouble in Britain's expensive property markets.
""In our view, a rate cut in the coming months would be largely futile, however it does appear a very real possibility,"" said Oliver Jones, an economist at Fathom Consulting.
""The Monetary Policy Committee also seems likely to restart quantitative easing, with a possible expansion of the scope. Purchasing corporate bonds would be the most effective of the Bank's options.""
Nearly two-thirds of 52 economists in a second Reuters poll said Bank Rate would remain steady at next week's meeting which concludes on July 14. Seventeen predicted a cut to 0.25 percent and another two saying rates will be chopped to zero next week. 
Median forecasts show a single cut to 0.25 percent by the end of the July-September quarter, by which time the economy is expected to be slowing even more. Most economists said Bank Rate would stay at 0.25 percent until the end of next year. 
The BoE is due to come up with fresh forecasts for the economy on Aug. 4 and it has traditionally timed big policy moves to coincide with those quarterly reports. 
By the time of its August meeting, the BoE will have a better idea of the referendum result's impact on the economy.
Overall economic growth in the April-June period probably already slowed to just 0.2 percent in the quarter, according to financial data firm Markit, which publishes closely watched purchasing managers' indexes.
Asked more broadly how the BoE was likely to respond to Brexit, a majority of economists who answered the question thought a combination of lower rates and more asset purchases, or quantitative easing (QE), was likely. 
The BoE first launched purchases of government bonds in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, adding 375 billion pounds to the central bank's balance sheet, about one-fifth of UK economic output. It has not made purchases for four years. 
POUND TO FALL FURTHER 
The pound Reuters poll of more than 60 foreign exchange strategists forecast the battered currency has further to fall. It will tumble to $1.27 by year end, down more than 4 percent from Monday's close of $1.33.
Strategists as a whole expect a slight recovery to $1.29 by this time next year -- nowhere near the $1.50 it was trading at before the historic vote to quit the EU.
Forecasts were in a wide range, from $1.24 to $1.40 in a month, $1.17 to $1.48 in three months, $1.11 to roughly $1.51 in six months and $1.07 to $1.57 in a year from now. That last forecast compares with $1.26 to $1.65 just one month ago.
The most pessimistic forecaster, Bayern LB, downgraded their 12-month view by nearly 40 cents.
Against the euro, the pound is expected to perform almost as poorly.
The outlook for British currency will hinge largely on whether or not the UK can remain part of the EU's single market or has a less open trading relationship with the bloc.
The formal process for Britain to leave the EU has not begun as the ruling Conservative Party seeks to replace Prime Minister David Cameron. Talks about the future of Britain's ties to the EU could take years to complete.

""I think if the Brexiteers push to leave the EU single market we will see another round of heavy selling"" of sterling, Angus Nicholson of IG Markets said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Australian dollar slipped on Tuesday as the central bank held steady and analysts speculated that easing could lie ahead, while the perceived safe-haven yen got a lift from worrying signs in China's service sector.
Trading was subdued with no directional clues from U.S. markets, which were shut on Monday for the Independence Day holiday. 
A private survey showed that activity in China's services sector rose to an 11-month high in June, but a composite measure of activity fell to a four-month low. That raised fears the services sector may not be able to make up for a prolonged decline in the industrial economy that has pushed China's growth to 25-year lows.
""There are no domestic factors that could explain the yen's strength, so it appears to be the 'risk-off' effect from China that's bringing the dollar/yen to test the 102 level,"" said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo. 
The dollar was down 0.5 percent at 102.03 yen  after briefly dipping as low as 101.985, while the euro fell 0.8 percent to 113.51 yen (EURJPY=R). 
The Aussie initially pulled away from session lows when the Reserve Bank of Australia kept policy steady, but then it slipped 0.3 percent to $0.7507 , moving away from Monday's more than one-week high of $0.7545. 
Australia's central bank kept its cash rate steady at 1.75 percent, a widely expected decision given political uncertainty at home and abroad and a lack of up to date information on domestic inflation. 
""The next natural signpost is the inflation data at the end of this month, so markets are anchored around a rate cut in August, and we think that won't be the last one either,"" said Ben Jarman, economist at JP Morgan.
Possible policy paralysis after no clear winner emerged from a weekend election continued to threaten the Aussie's outlook, in addition to the potential Brexit fallout. 
""Brexit is not a direct threat to Australia, but over time the hit to investment and risk-taking sentiment may weigh on commodity prices, adding to the pressure on the RBA,"" Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at FXPrimus, said in a note.
Brexit has ramped up the urgency for some Asian central banks to ease monetary policy, as a prolonged period of uncertainty threatens a wider downshift in trade and investment.
The timing of Britain's actual exit from the EU remains unclear, and against this backdrop, investors have begun to hope for additional stimulus and UK corporate tax cuts to blunt the impact of the move.
Sterling shed 0.3 percent to $1.3247 , but remained above last week's 31-year trough of $1.3122 plumbed in the wake of the Brexit vote. 
The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was steady at 95.653 (DXY).

LONDON (Reuters) - The Australian dollar recovered from a wobbly start on Monday, as commodities rose on expectations that global central banks are likely to provide more stimulus to offset the impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
Traditional safe-haven currencies such as the yen  and the Swiss franc (EURCHF=) were weaker, with some of the anxiety around the Brexit vote fading into the background for now.
Trading was subdued in London afternoon trade as U.S. markets are shut for the Independence Day public holiday.
Australia's election this weekend produced no clear winner after more than two-thirds of the votes were counted, sending the higher-yielding, commodity-linked dollar down to $0.7410  in early trade, from $0.7495 in New York on Friday. It has since rebounded to $0.7544, up 0.7 percent on the day.
""For the big picture, the election result is hardly relevant,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann said, noting expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise rates was making the Aussie an attractive option. 
Bond markets around the world have been rallying, with Treasury yields falling sharply and British gilt yields tumbling to record lows. Investors have priced out any chance of a U.S. rate hike this year while a rate cut by the Bank of England this summer is almost fully priced in. 
STABLE POUND
Sterling climbed to $1.3290 , taking a disappointing British construction survey in its stride and stabilising after an 11-percent plunge to a 31-year trough of $1.3122 a week ago in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Some traders say the uncertainty about when Britain will leave the EU will continue for sometime as the timing of the next steps are unclear. 
""Various political decisions need to be taken in Europe in the next few months which can move sterling decisively. We believe Bank of England easing is likely in the second half of 2016, which may already have been priced in somewhat,"" UBS Wealth Management strategists said in a note.
""Our new forecast of $1.32 should therefore be seen as the mid-point of a wider range, reaching up to $1.38 on the upside, but also not ruling out moves below $1.30.""
For the other major currencies, Brexit is starting to fade as a driver, with nervousness soothed by the promises of more stimulus and talk of UK corporate tax cuts to offset the shock of leaving the EU.

The euro stood at $1.1140 , flat on the day, and slightly higher against the yen at 114.30 (EURJPY=R). The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 102.60 yen.

The currency pair traded between 1.3247 and 1.3350, down 0.0082 or 0.37% on the session. After briefly moving above 1.50 against the U.S. dollar in the final hours of Brexit polling last Thursday, the Pound Sterling has tumbled approximately 10% against the greenback over the last week. In Monday's session, the Pound plummeted to an intraday low of 1.3118 against its American counterpart, its lowest level since September, 1985.
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.3118, the low from June 27 and was met with resistance at 1.5020, the high from June 24.
Maintaining his current hard line stance, France president Francois Hollande reiterated his position that the results of last week's historic referendum can not be reversed. Appearing alongside David Cameron in Northern France after appearing at a ceremony to commemorate the Battle of the Somme, Hollande remained adamant that the U.K. will have to face the consequences of the unexpected decision. In addition, Hollande urged leaders that a swift resolution to the Brexit developments would help diminish the uncertainty that has gripped the euro area over the last week.
""Being in the European Union has advantages. And that's what the British are starting to understand,"" Hollande said. ""Those who were tempted by the Brexit are starting to think it over…The faster it goes, the better it will be for them.""
Hollande's comments came one day after Bank of England governor Mark Carney noted that the BOE will likely approve further easing measures at some point this summer to help safeguard the economy. Earlier this week, Cameron said he would leave the task of whether to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to his successor. Cameron is expected to step down by September 2.
Elsewhere, Fed governor Stanley Fischer cautioned that it could be some time before the U.S. central bank will be able to determine the long-term effects of the Brexit referendum on monetary policy. In the meantime, Fischer said he is hopeful the Fed can continue tightening at a ""slow, very gradual"" pace amid signals of an improved economy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will re-assess the implications of the Brexit vote on the timing of its next rate hike when it meets again on July 26-27, he added.
""We are going to have to wait and see,” Fischer said in an interview with CNBC. “It clearly is a huge event for the U.K. and it’s an important event for Europe. Our direct trade with Britain is not going to make a huge difference to us, but it could set off -- there are a lot of things that will follow from Brexit for Europe, for the United Kingdom, and those are the things we will have to be thinking about.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.25% to an intraday low of 95.23, before rallying slightly to 95.72 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading. The index dropped by nearly 3% over the first half.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 04:46AM ET</span>",Yen gains on safe-haven demand,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen climbed sharply against the dollar, euro and sterling on Friday, as political uncertainty and a Reuters report that the European Central Bank was not considering loosening its rules on monetary easing boosted demand for safe havens. 
The euro recovered against the dollar  after sources told Reuters that the ECB is not currently discussing buying government debt out of proportion to euro zone countries' shareholding in the bank, and the hurdle for abandoning this capital key is high.
The euro had fallen sharply on Thursday, along with European bond yields, and had continued its fall on Friday, on a Bloomberg report that the ECB had been considering giving up the capital key due to a shortage of German paper, which investors see as safe and have piled into in the aftermath of Britain's vote to leave the European Union last week.
But after Reuters reported on Friday that several other changes would be first considered before any such move, the euro inched up to trade flat on the day at $1.1110. In choppy trade for European stock markets, the yen hit day's highs of 102.435 versus the dollar , up 0.8 percent. 
After hitting a 2-1/2-year high in the wake of the vote for Brexit, the safe-haven yen had eased off this week, falling for three successive days against the dollar and euro as sterling made a recovery from a 31-year low . 
But with political uncertainty in Britain remaining high, and after the head of the Bank of England said that more stimulus would probably be needed over the summer to prop up the economy, sterling fell back towards its lows against the dollar, and fell more than 1 percent against the yen on Friday (GBPJPY=).
""We will have much more global repercussions to all of this ... and given the risk that global growth will slow, I don't think investors are going to move out of the yen in great numbers,"" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, from London. 
Foley also suggested that the Australian and New Zealand dollar   might be acting as ""geographical safe havens"" as their economies were strong enough and they were far enough removed from Europe that they were seen as somewhat insulated from its current problems. 
Against the yen, sterling skidded to 136.11 (GBPJPY=R), but held off a 3-1/2 year low of 133.65 set last Friday.
Against the euro, the pound's falls have not been so steep, although it hit its weakest since March 2014 against the single currency on Thursday (EURGBP=D4). 
""It's been said that the euro zone is vulnerable to Brexit after the UK but the euro hasn't fallen much perhaps because the impact is not just clear yet,"" said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
""But when you consider, the euro zone will have to take the brunt of rise in sterling so the economy will likely suffer. The market will probably start to price that in when things become clearer.""

Analysts had expected the index to drop back into contraction at 49.9 in May.
But the pound remained under pressure as markets were still recovering from Britain’s shock decision last week to leave the European Union.

USD/JPY changed hands at 102.90, down 0.31% after the data, while GBP/USD traded at 1.3338, up 0.21%. AUD/USD traded at 0.7448, down 0.04%.
Manufacfturing gauges in China released on Friday painted a mixed picture with an unexpected drop in the Caixin survey and an expected result from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) and National Bureau of Statistics.
Earlier, Australia's the AIG manufacturing index came in at 51.8, above 51.0 for the previous month, the 12th straight month of expansion in the manufacturing industry aided by the fall in the exchange rate over recent years. But businesses in general continue to face uncertainty from the impending federal election.
In Japan national core CPI for May fell 0.4% year-on-year as expected. As well household spending for May dropped 1.1% year-on-year, less than the 1.4% decline seen, but the month-on-month figure fell 1.5%, more than the 0.2% decline expected.
Overall, a slower pace of wage hikes in fiscal 2016 is clouding the prospect for the Bank of Japan guiding inflation to 2% from zero in the next two years. The recent appreciation of the yen will lower import costs and support small firms and households but from the BoJ's viewpoint, it will go against efforts to reflate the economy.
The unemployment rate in Japan for May held steady at 3.2% and the Tankan all big industry CAPEX for the second quarter rose 6.2%, beating the 5.9% gain expected.

Overnight, GBP/USD pared some losses after re-testing 31-year lows on Thursday, as Bank of England governor Mark Carney sent strong hints that the Bank of England could ease monetary policy later this summer to help prevent irreparable harm to the British economy in the wake of last week's Brexit decision.
Delivering his second public address since last week's shocking Brexit outcome, Carney emphasized that the BOE could lower interest rates in the coming months to safeguard the economy from further shocks emanating from last week's Brexit vote. The BOE has left interest rates steady since 2012 and held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.5% in every meeting dating back to 2009. While the BOE meets next in July, Carney hinted that the central bank could wait until August to loosen policy.
""It now seems plausible that uncertainty could remain elevated for some time,” Carney said. ""The economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be needed over the summer.""
Notably, Carney said at Thursday's press conference that the Bank of England has not needed to intervene in global foreign exchange markets buy purchasing large quantities of the Pound in order to prevent further losses.
""There were some pretty big moves in the currency, that was to be expected, given the scale of the change,"" Carney said. ""Those markets functioned very well, the markets were liquid, there were huge volumes.
While the currency was moving it wasn't moving because of market technicals, it was moving because of opinions from investors as new information came. The market was functioning and when the market is function you don't want to get in the way.""
In the U.S., initial jobless claims rose by 10,000 to a slightly stronger than expected 268,000. The four-week moving average, however, remained unchanged at 266,750, down roughly 10,000 from its level a month ago. Investors await a critical U.S. employment report on July 8 for further indications on the strength of the labor market. In May, the economy added 38,000 nonfarm payrolls, its lowest monthly total in nearly six years.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2016 12:12PM ET</span>","Exclusive: China to tolerate weaker yuan, wary of trade partners' reaction - sources","By Kevin Yao, Nathaniel Taplin and Lu Jianxin
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank would tolerate a fall in the yuan to as low as 6.8 per dollar in 2016 to support the economy, which would mean the currency matching last year's record decline of 4.5 percent, policy sources said.
The yuan is already trading at its lowest level in more than five years, so the central bank would ensure any decline is gradual for fear of triggering capital outflows and criticism from trading partners such as the United States, said government economists and advisers involved in regular policy discussions.
Presumptive U.S. Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump already has China in his sights, saying on Wednesday he would label China a currency manipulator if elected in November.
The economists and advisers are not directly briefed on policy by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), but they have regular meetings and interactions with central bank officials and they provide policy recommendations. They said the central bank would tolerate a further weakening of the yuan this year to between 6.7-6.8 per dollar.
""The central bank is willing to see yuan depreciation, as long as depreciation expectations are under control,"" said a government economist, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""The Brexit vote was a big shock. The market volatility may last for some time.""
Investors keep a close watch when the yuan is in decline. A surprise devaluation of the yuan last August sent global markets into a spin on worries the world's second-biggest economy was in worst shape than Beijing had let on, prompting massive capital outflows as investors sought safe havens overseas.
Other emerging market currencies have also fallen in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, but the yuan is the weakest major Asian currency against the dollar this year.
Following the Reuters report, the yuan  fell as low as 6.6549 per dollar, near a 5-1/2 year intraday low on Monday. State-owned banks were suspected of intervening to sell dollars, currency traders said.
At the low, the yuan had fallen about 2.4 percent this year.
After the report, the PBOC said China had no intention to promote trade competitiveness through depreciation of the yuan, a comment that has also been made repeatedly by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.
Without citing any media by name, it said on its website that some media continuously published ""inaccurate information"" on the yuan's exchange rate. These reports interrupt the normal operation of the market and help ""speculative forces"" short - or bet against - the yuan, it said.
TRADE RELATIONS
Currency dealers said the dollar's strength and weakness in China's economic growth, which hit a 25-year low in 2015, justified a decline in the yuan.
But a significant decline is likely to leave investors and trading partners concerned in the wake of August's devaluation and another sharp decline in the currency over a matter of days in January, which analysts said was engineered by the central bank.
In the past decade, China has also faced criticism from Western lawmakers who say it held back the appreciation of the yuan.
Earlier this month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said it would be ""problematic"" if the yuan only went down over time and Trump has said he would take a hard line on trade disputes with China if elected.
Labeling China a currency manipulator ""should've been done a long time ago,"" he said on Wednesday.
China's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday the exchange rate was not the reason for unbalanced trade with the United States, which runs a goods and services trade deficit with China.
However, the sources acknowledged the diplomatic risks of a steep fall in the yuan.
""The pressure from the United States could rise if China allows sharp depreciation,"" said a government source.
China has the biggest global exports market share of any country since the United States in 1968, so the yuan's exchange rate acts as a bellwether for other exporting countries.
While a South Korean finance ministry official said ""we are concerned"" about the yuan's slide, a person familiar with Japan's currency diplomacy said the yuan's decline didn't seem out of line considering the dollar's strength.
""I don't think Japan has much to complain about,"" this official said.
The officials of these major exporters declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the issue.
MARKET FORCES
""We should gradually let market forces play a bigger role. The market believes that the yuan is under pressure, so our foreign exchange policy should follow this trend,"" said a researcher with the Commerce Ministry.
""China needs to safeguard its economic growth and trade but also make sure we don't create competitive devaluation.""
Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note last week that a sharp fall ""could set off a renewed bout of fears over renminbi depreciation and a pick-up in capital outflows."" The yuan is also known as the renminbi.
But he said the central bank would want to avoid ""panic"" so was likely to intervene to stabilize the currency if need be.
The PBOC has been trying to reform the way it manages the yuan by making it more market-driven and transparent.
It sets the yuan's daily mid-point versus the dollar based on the previous day's closing price, taking into account changes in major currencies, analysts and officials said.
This year, the PBOC has been guiding the yuan lower by pegging it to the dollar when the U.S. currency weakens and pegging it to a basket of currencies when the dollar rises, they said.
The currency regime gives the central bank more room to allow two-way swings in the yuan versus the dollar, deterring one-way bets on the currency.

In Brussels, European Council president Donald Tusk told reporters outside the EU Summit that it will not start the divorce process on any future negotiations with the U.K. until the country invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It came one day after U.K. prime minister David Cameron said he will leave the task to his successor when he steps down from the position by early-September. Once the U.K. summons Article 50, it will initiate formal negotiations with the European Union to leave the European bloc, a process which is expected to take a minimum of two years.
Tusk's stance followed stern comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel just hours earlier. Speaking to reporters outside the Summit, Merkel called the results of the Brexit referendum irreversible, reiterating that she sees ""no way back"" for the U.K.  following the surprising vote. At the same time, France president Francois Hollande warned that it will be difficult for the U.K. to gain access to the EU's single market without ""applying the rules of freedom of movement,"" a potential sticking point between the sides.

While speaking at a meeting of North American leaders in Ottawa, Obama indicated that markets worldwide appear to be holding ""steady following the initial shock of the Leave campaign's victory.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2016 06:30PM ET</span>",The yen as a safe haven: a familiar but painful refrain for Japan,"By Linda Sieg and Jongwoo Cheon
TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A weak economy, deflation, massive public debt, negative interest rates and an ageing citizenry don't seem like good reasons for a country’s currency to surge, but that’s exactly what happened to Japan’s yen after Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
The safe-haven phenomenon is a huge headache for the Japanese government with few easy options to curb a rise that badly hurts the nation’s exporters and could tip the economy back into recession. The stronger yen was the main reason for an 8 percent drop in Japanese stocks last Friday when the Brexit vote became clear.
Japanese authorities have been here before.
The yen has appreciated sharply due to a perceived rise in global risk at least a dozen times since the mid-1990s, a study by the International Monetary Fund in 2013 showed.
When the world is facing a major financial or political disruption, investors look for a relatively safe place for their money – and despite the dreadful economic backdrop, Japan and yen assets are seen as one of the safe havens, a place to hide with little perceived downside risk.
""Japan ... is a banker to the world,"" said Martin Schulz, an economist at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo. ""And when risk goes up, you're looking for a safe 'bank'.""
Paradoxically the world's biggest debtor nation – whose public debt is more than twice the value of its gross domestic product - is also its biggest creditor, a status Japan has kept for the past quarter century.
It runs a persistent current account surplus - a broad measure of trade in goods and services. That was long due to a trade surplus but more recently to income from overseas investments that offset export declines.
Indeed, the value of assets held overseas by Japanese investors consistently exceeds the value of Japanese assets owned by foreign investors. Domestic investors own 90 percent of the nation's public debt.
THE RUSH BACK HOME
When markets turn risky, Japanese companies, insurers and investors with money abroad bring some of it home, driving up the yen, while foreign investors also move into the Japanese currency as they look for shelter.
""When risk increases internationally, Japanese investors pull capital back and international investors look for countries that are safe because they are lenders to the world,"" added Schulz.
The so-called yen ""carry trade"", in which investors borrow in yen at low rates and invest in higher return assets, can also contribute to a yen jump when there is financial turmoil, as global speculators unwind risky positions and pay back yen loans. This has occurred on and off since the early 2000s, when the Bank of Japan cut rates to record lows.
""Speculators live off leveraging funds in Japanese yen and Swiss francs with zero funding costs. The moment the position goes against them, they have to cut their positions and pay back the loans,"" said Jesper Koll, CEO at fund manager WisdomTree Japan. ""It's a risk-off currency.""
The three-month yen LIBOR rate, a benchmark for short-term loans, is currently minus 0.034 percent , compared to a positive 0.627 percent for a similar dollar rate  and 0.548 percent for sterling .
""After the Brexit vote, the move lower was just a pure risk-off trade and selling of cross-yen pairs,"" said Tareck Horchani, director of global sales trading at Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.
Rather than a welcome vote of confidence, of course, the yen's rise - it jumped briefly above 100 to the dollar on Friday and was trading at around 102.57 late on Wednesday in Asia - fans fears that costlier Japanese exports will flag, further weakening an economy suffering from slack corporate investment and household spending.
INTERVENTION
But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his policy makers have few powerful weapons left with the economy so sluggish and interest rates now negative.
The quantitative monetary easing that is key to Abe’s economic revival policy sent the yen tumbling almost 37 percent to a 13-year-low of 125.86 in June 2015 from 79.06 yen in November 2012, just before he took office. 
That process has gone into reverse since then. The Japanese currency had risen 15 percent this year alone, even before the Brexit shock.
Japan’s current account surplus, helped by low energy prices in recent years, and delays in Fed plans to hike U.S. interest rates, are key reasons for the yen's strength, according to Yasunori Iwanaga, chief investment officer of Tokyo-based asset manager Amundi Japan.
""Besides, despite the government policies, the economy still remains in the prolonged deflationary environment. These factors are behind the strength of the yen,"" he said.
Japan has reacted in the past by selling yen, either unilaterally or in concert with other countries from the Group of Seven nations, and that usually weakens the currency at least temporarily. The most recent intervention came after the currency hit its strongest level ever at 75.30 yen to the dollar in October 2011.
Authorities have stepped up talk of again intervening to weaken the yen. But such a move by Japan alone would be unlikely to have much impact and persuading Washington to join in could be tough after repeated warnings against trying to give Japanese firms a competitive edge by weakening the currency.
The Bank of Japan could expand its monetary stimulus, but with that policy thought by many to be reaching its limits, the move might merely halt further yen gains, rather than weaken it.

""The tools that the BOJ has are very defensive tools. Maybe they could prevent even greater appreciation, but they are not active tools,"" said Markus Schomer, chief economist at New York-based asset manager PineBridge Investments, speaking this week in Singapore.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2016 03:18PM ET</span>","Sterling, euro rebound for second day on reduced Brexit anxiety","By Sam Forgione
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped against the euro and sterling for a second straight day on Wednesday on potential profit-taking and a rebound in risk appetite stemming from reduced concerns surrounding Britain's vote to exit the European Union.
Sterling , which suffered its biggest one-day fall in modern history on Friday, was last up 0.7 percent against the greenback at $1.3434. In earlier U.S. trading, sterling hit a session high of $1.3534, marking a more than four-cent rebound from a 31-year low of $1.3122 touched on Monday. 
Sterling declined more than 17 cents overall in the two days following the Brexit vote. 
""There’s some element of profit-taking,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York, in reference to traders repurchasing sterling and the euro after betting against or ""shorting"" the currencies. ""It’s just a pullback, I think, from the first, most negative reactions"" to the Brexit vote, he said. 
The euro was last up 0.4 percent against the dollar at $1.1105 <EUR=>, rebounding further from a 3-1/2-month low of $1.0909 on Friday. Analysts said traders were relieved by the prospect of prolonged negotiations among European policymakers before the UK's divorce from the EU. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was last down 0.5 percent at 95.764 (DXY) after hitting a more than 3-1/2-month high of 96.705 on Monday. 
Riskier commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars gained, with the Aussie last up 0.7 percent at $0.7440  and the kiwi <NZD=D4> up 1.1 percent at $0.7119. 
The EU's 27 member states, excluding Britain, met Wednesday in Brussels following Tuesday's summit with the British prime minister, to discuss how to respond to the Brexit vote.
Traders were also likely calmed by the fact that Britain had not started the formal process of quitting the EU by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
Analysts said uncertainty remained and sterling had further room to fall. The dollar, which sank against the safe-haven yen after the Brexit vote, was last down just 0.2 percent at 102.54 yen <JPY=>. 

The dollar was last down 0.2 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.9796 franc .

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>",China's yuan lingers near five-and-half year low as central bank stays on sidelines,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The yuan was little changed on Wednesday, hovering near its 5-1/2-year low against the dollar, after heavy dollar buying by banks' clients offset the central bank's stronger midpoint setting.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) appeared to have remained on the sidelines in the morning, letting the market dollar demand keep the yuan soft, traders said.
""Dollar buying in the market was much stronger than in the past few days, which means clients were a bit panicky,"" said a trader at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai. ""The Brexit aftermath is still reverberating.""
Traders reported no sign of PBOC intervention and say the central bank is letting market forces play a bigger role in determining the yuan's value.
""Given that market expectations are now tilting towards yuan depreciation, the PBOC is quietly allowing the yuan to slide further as long as intraday swings do not get out of hand,"" said a dealer at another Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai.
Prior to market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint rate  at 6.6324 per dollar, 0.31 percent firmer than the previous fix of 6.6528, ending a three-day string of weaker settings after the British vote to leave the European Union.
Spot yuan  opened at 6.6426 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.6530 at midday, easing only 0.02 percent from the previous close and 206 pips softer than the midpoint. The currency was close to 6.6585, the lowest level since December 2010, that it touched on Monday.
Some traders said the over 200 pip gap between the spot yuan and the official guidance rate indicated the PBOC is tolerating the yuan's depreciation.
As of midday, the Chinese currency had weakened 1.1 percent in June. In May, it lost 1.5 percent, the second biggest monthly fall on record.
On June 26, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) forecast that the yuan will weaken to 7.0 against the dollar by the end of this year.

On Wednesday, the offshore yuan was trading 0.36 percent softer than the onshore spot at 6.6772 per dollar.

The currency pair stood at 1.3327 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading, up 0.0108 or 0.82%. At session-highs, the Pound hit 1.3418 against the Dollar, considerably above Monday's intraday low of 1.3118, its lowest level since September, 1985. Despite Tuesday's rebound, the Pound has still tumbled more than 10% against its American counterpart since polls closed last Thursday night in the historic U.K. referendum. When the final results were tallied, U.K. voters decided to approve a measure to leave the European Union by a 52-48% margin.
Addressing a crowd of prominent leaders at a dinner speech at the two-day EU Summit in Brussels, U.K. prime minister David Cameron emphasized that both parties moving forward would like to see a ""clear model"" for interactions between the U.K. and the remaining members of the European bloc. Cameron reiterated comments made before Parliament a day earlier that he would not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, an action he will leave to his successor. On Monday, Cameron announced that he will step down from his position by September 2 in the wake of last week's surprising decision by U.K. voters.
If the U.K. decides to invoke Article 50 it will initiate a two-year process for formal negotiations of Britain's departure from the 28-nation bloc. With last week's decisive victory, the U.K. became the first nation in more than six decades to approve a measure for opting out of the EU. In Cameron's final appearance in Brussels in his current role, the U.K. prime minister emphasized that the EU must offer more concessions to Britain in terms of immigration reform in order to consummate a deal.
Earlier, Cameron's counterparts maintained a hard line stance against Britain ahead of the summit. While addressing the Bundestag, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel rejected a proposal from former London mayor Boris Johnson which would enable Britain to receive access to the European single market while simultaneously enacting a measure that would severely restrict immigration into the U.K. In an interview with CNN, Italy prime minister Matteo Renzi echoed the sentiments.
The Pound hit session-lows on Tuesday after credit ratings agency Moody's lowered its outlook on a dozen British banks, amid widespread trade and credit concerns. Eight banks, including  Barclays PLC  (NYSE:BCS),  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) PLC (NYSE:HSBC) and Santander U.K (MC:SAN) were downgraded from stable to negative, while Lloyd's and Principality Building Society were lowered from positive to stable.
""We expect lower economic growth and heightened uncertainty over the U.K.'s future trade relationship with the EU to lead to reduced demand for credit, higher credit losses and more volatile wholesale funding conditions for U.K. financial institutions,"" Moody's said in a statement. ""This will be negative for banks' credit fundamentals, as reflected in today's rating actions. Simultaneously, we have changed the outlook on the U.K. banking system to negative from stable.""

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2016 02:00PM ET</span>",Sterling regains ground after hitting 31-year low,"By Jemima Kelly and Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery by sterling stalled in late trading in London on Tuesday, as worries over banks, growth and investment continued to dominate the market following Britain's vote last week to leave the European Union.
The pound rebounded by as much as 1.5 percent  from its 11 percent plunge after the British referendum - a decent rebound under normal market conditions. 
But it paled into insignificance compared with the currency's decline to a 31-year low. Its 7 percent drop on Friday was its steepest one-day decline in the post-1973 era of floating exchange rates. 
Sterling reached $1.3421 around midday on Tuesday, still more than 16 cents lower than before the referendum results, then fell back to $1.3327. A mass of banks and fund managers have predicted further declines for the pound since Friday.
""It does seem clear that sterling goes down in trade-weighted terms over the short to medium term,"" said Richard Benson, a portfolio manager at Millennium Global. ""There is no doubt that the impact on the UK economy is negative. It is a tier one economic shock.""
He and some other analysts and investors, however, said sterling was likely to get some support from shifting expectations on U.S. interest rates. 
Markets are now pricing in a 7 percent chance the Federal Reserve will cut rates in July and an 18 percent chance of a cut in September. They discarded any chance of a rate increase this year, according to CME FedWatch. 
""Janet Yellen could not bring herself to raise rates when the conditions were perfect for it. She is not going to do it now,"" Benson said.
Some analysts said markets were taking some reassurance from the fact that British politicians were not rushing to trigger the Article 50 mechanism for a state to leave the EU.
British finance minister George Osborne said on Tuesday that Article 50 - the relevant clause of the EU's Lisbon Treaty - should not be invoked until the shape of Britain's future relationship with the EU had become clear.
Political rhetoric would be likely to move the pound around over the coming weeks, said Derek Halpenny, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's European head of global markets research.
""Like all markets, there's bound to be periods when we get some modest rebound or consolidation,"" Halpenny said. 
""Why today? Perhaps it's a sense of some of this backtracking that's taking place from the 'Leave' side in terms of immigration in particular, which might be an indication that they're looking to get a still quite favorable deal in regard to access to the single market,"" he said.
Halpenny was referring to comments made by Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan on Friday, who said the ""Leave"" campaign never promised a radical decline in immigration, and by anti-EU UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who on Monday said he was ""nervous"" about some of the comments that had been made after the referendum.
The ratings agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch both downgraded Britain's sovereign credit standing on Monday, judging Brexit would hurt the economy, though that did not seem to further damage sterling .
EURO ALSO VULNERABLE
The world's biggest banks are considering a fall in sterling to $1.20. Forecasts for its rate by the end of the year have been cut by up to 30 cents since Friday morning. 
Most analysts agree the euro will suffer along with sterling from a decline in demand and investment as European businesses worry about fallout. For the moment, at least, that is reducing the scale of sterling's weakness against the single currency. 
On Tuesday it rose 0.7 percent against the euro to 82.861 pence (EURGBP=D4), having reached its weakest for more than two years on Monday.
Against the safe-haven yen, which had climbed to a 3 1/2-year high against the pound, sterling rose as much as 2 percent on the day to trade as high as 137.43 yen (GBPJPY=). 

Strategists said SONIA forwards fully priced in a Bank of England rate cut by the end of the year and better than a 50 percent chance of one by August, which should keep sterling weak. Before the vote, they suggested only a 20 to 30 percent chance of a cut by year-end.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2016 11:50PM ET</span>",BOJ's regular dollar-supplying operation draws offers of $1.47 billion,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's regular dollar-supplying operation drew offers of $1.47 billion, the central bank said on Tuesday, far greater than its last such operation before markets were roiled by Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
""Our country has no problem meeting our institutions' foreign currency needs,"" a BOJ official said after the operation.
The central bank offered 8-day dollar funding at 0.870 percent from June 30 to July 8. 
The size of the offered take-up was the largest since December 2014 when the central bank supplied $1.528 billion of 10-day dollar cash.
The BOJ typically receives a higher-than-usual amount of bids whenever it offers dollar funding that extends beyond the end of a quarter, though Tuesday's much greater amount was likely in response to volatile market conditions following British voters' decision on Thursday to leave the European Union. 
The BOJ first offered dollar funds in September 2008 as it joined other central banks in opening the dollar liquidity swap lines with the Federal Reserve after the Lehman meltdown.

Tuesday's amount, though high compared with recent periods, was still less than the tens of billions of dollars that the BOJ supplied in operations after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

In London, U.K. prime minister David Cameron took steps to calm voters nationwide and markets overall, days after last week's shocking result  in the controversial Brexit referendum. Addressing Parliament on Monday afternoon, Cameron emphasized that while the result of the referendum was not the outcome he preferred, it is a decision that he will respect along with the rest of his cabinet. Cameron also said that the U.K. has created a new civil service designed specifically for withdrawal discussions from the EU. While Cameron said last Friday that he plans to leave office by October, his administration announced on Monday that a new prime minister will be put in place by September 2. Cameron emphasized that the domestic economy remains on solid footing due to low, stable inflation and a comparatively low unemployment rate.
In addition, he told Parliament that the financial system is ""substantially more resilient"" than it was six years, as capital requirements remain 10 times higher than from the Financial Crisis. The U.K. prime minister also reiterated that the Bank of England has set aside an additional £250 Billion in liquidity to support the nation's banks and financial markets.
""It is clear that markets are volatile, some companies are considering their investments and we know this will be far from plain sailing. However, we should take confidence from the fact that Britain is ready to confront what the future holds for us from a position of strength,"" Cameron said in his speech.
Shortly after, though, the Pound slid further after Standard & Poor's lowered its credit rating on U.K's sovereign debt from AAA to AA, as it weighed the possibility of future contagion effects if other nations in the EU decide to leave the European bloc. In lowering its outlook for U.K. bonds to negative, S&P cited heightened risks of market deterioration on external financial conditions, as well the wider constitutional issues surrounding a potential U.K. departure by Northern Island or Scotland. In last week's referendum, Scotland voters backed the Remain campaign by a 62-38% margin, triggering concerns that the country could look to leave the U.K. in the coming months.
As major banking stocks in the euro area completed their largest two-day sell-off on record, investors sought safety in Gold, government bonds and the U.S. dollar.

After the biggest daily fall in the pound in modern history on Friday, both U.S. banks were forced to slash their forecasts for the rest of 2016, in BAML's case by almost 30 cents.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2016 03:38AM ET</span>",Sterling and euro struggle as Brexit shock lingers,"By Anirban Nag
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling stayed under siege on Monday, holding above a 31-year low against the dollar, with sentiment distinctly sour after Britain opted to exit the European Union, triggering shockwaves across global markets.
The euro was also under pressure, pulled down by sterling, as Brexit clouded the future of the European Union. Safe-haven currencies like the yen and the Swiss franc extended gains, much to the discomfiture of the Japanese and Swiss central banks. 
Sterling was down 1.8 percent at $1.3460 , having hit a trough of $1.3228 on Friday, its lowest since 1985. It recovered from a low of $1.3356 struck in Asia on Monday after British Chancellor George Osborne sought to assure markets that he was staying on and that the economy was in good shape. 
The pound dropped as much as 11 percent on Friday, its worst day in modern history, as investors betting on Britain remaining in the EU were reversed en masse. 
And while the shock and panic appeared to have subsided for now, price swings are likely to be extreme given the lack of clarity on who runs the British government, a likely fresh move for Scottish secession, the response of the EU and its ability to contain calls by anti-EU parties across the continent. 
Given all the uncertainty, investors were pricing in a chance of a rate cut with some analysts expecting the Bank of England to consider quantitative easing to cushion the economy.
""The overnight indexed swap market is currently pricing 38 basis points of cuts from the BoE over one-year time horizon,"" said Petr Krpata, currency strategist at ING, adding investors were also concerned about Britain's large current account deficit, pegged at 7 percent of GDP.
""While we deem sterling as undervalued at these levels, the mixture of political uncertainty, flagging growth and concerns about the current account deficit should keep a lid on sterling during the weeks and months ahead and prevent any meaningful or long lasting recovery.""
Many economists have cut growth forecast for the UK. Goldman saw Britain entering a mild recession within a year due to a deterioration in its terms of trade, scaled-back investment and tighter financial conditions because of exchange rate fluctuations, and weakness in risk assets.
SAFETY IN YEN
The safe-haven yen and the Swiss franc (EURCHF=) rose broadly. The Swiss National Bank had intervened on Friday while investors are likely to test the Bank of Japan's resolve in coming weeks.
The greenback was weaker at 102.15 yen  after shedding 1.8 percent last week. The dollar hit 99 yen on Friday, its lowest since November 2013.
""If the yen was to strengthen further, it likely won't be due to speculative forces alone. The so-called 'real money' Japanese investors could repatriate funds and add to yen strength,"" said Koji Fukaya, president of FPG Securities in Tokyo.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he has instructed Finance Minister Taro Aso to watch currency markets ""ever more closely"" and take steps if necessary, four days after Britain's historic vote.

The euro  was down 0.5 percent at $1.1055, having hit a three-month low of $1.0912. It was 0.7 percent lower against the yen.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling recovered around half a cent from overnight lows as trading got going in London on Monday, but was still 2 percent down from levels hit at the end of its worst day in modern history on Friday. 
Chancellor George Osborne's promise to stay on for the moment and implement ""robust"" contingency plans with the Bank of England if need be steadied nerves somewhat and sterling inched up to trade around $1.3430 from lows of $1.3356 overnight.  
Since the result of Thursday's vote became clear, however, a raft of banks have forecast the pound to head below $1.30 and even against a weakened euro it was down another 1.2 percent at 82.20 pence. (EURGBP=)
""The clear risk must be for further downside,"" said Neil Mellor, a currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) in London. 
""Uncertainty equals currency weakness, we know this, and there is no sense that this (sterling) is a value trade right now and that you have to get back in. It is too early for anyone to start calling a bottom.""

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2016 03:51AM ET</span>",Brexit more heartburn than heart attack for hedge funds,"By Lawrence Delevingne and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - UK voters' surprise decision to leave the European Union roiled markets on Friday, but hedge funds appear to have avoided crippling losses, according to market data and people familiar with fund performance.
Money managers were positioned relatively defensively coming into the vote, meaning they had reduced the amount of capital exposed to market turbulence, and even used the resulting sell-off as a buying opportunity, according to a report from Credit Suisse's prime brokerage division late on Friday. ""I don’t want to say it’s a non-event, but we’re not seeing panic,” said Eric Siegel, head of hedge fund investments at Citi Private Bank. ""It’s just a bad day in the market.""
Hedge  funds that bet on or against European stocks were hit hardest on Friday, with most losing between 2 and 4 percent, two investors familiar with the numbers said. 
For some the pain was even worse. The London-based Adelphi Capital's $1.9 billion European fund was off 8 percent at one point on Friday, a person familiar with the fund's performance said. The fund was already down 9.5 percent for the year through late last week. 
How the approximately 8,400-fund industry fared during the Brexit turmoil will not be clear until early July when clients get their monthly performance reports. 
While funds were relatively well prepared for gains in U.S. Treasuries and a fall in the pound, they remained exposed to the steep declines that hit equity markets, according to weekly data sent by traders to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
GAINING GROUND
Yet many funds appeared to have fared relatively well.
Money managers that use macroeconomic theories and computer-guided ""systematic"" predictions to invest generally saw their funds remain steady or turn a small profit following news of the ""Leave"" vote, according to interviews with hedge funds and their clients. 
Managers using such strategies can quickly adjust portfolios and react to data, unlike so-called fundamental managers who are often forced to stick with individual stocks and bonds.
For example, the main fund managed by Sweden-based $6.5 billion Lynx Asset Management gained 5 percent as of Friday afternoon on the British vote, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The fund's computers recently positioned it in a short against the British pound, a lucrative bet given the currency's record plunge following the vote. 
Alcova Asset Management, a small London-based quantitative firm, benefited from its short stock bets, and its main fund gained about 1.5 percent following the referendum result, according to a person familiar with the situation. 
A larger London-based peer Winton Capital, said its main systematic trading strategy produced a 3.1 percent gain early on Friday, driven in part by ""long-standing"" short bets on the pound and euro, according to a note to clients seen by Reuters.
Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who backed the ""Leave"" campaign, could turn out to be one of the biggest financial winners of the vote to quit the bloc.
The boss of Odey Asset Management had bet his $10.2 billion firm's assets on a fall in financial markets, including a series of ""short"" trading positions and a punt on gold.
Other winners, according to people familiar with the firms, included funds managed by Millburn Ridgefield Corporation, which gained 2.6 percent before fees as of Friday morning; Welton Global Directional Portfolio, which was up 2.3 percent on the day thanks to short selling the pound and euro and going long U.S., German and UK government bonds; and volatility-focused Argentière Capital, which had one of its funds rise 2 percent Friday.
""Given the volatility in the broader markets, hedge fund managers are holding up quite well,"" said Raymond Nolte, chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital. 
None of the hedge funds mentioned would speak publicly on the returns or did not respond to requests for comment.
FRUSTRATION EVIDENT
To be sure, many hedge fund clients headed into the weekend frustrated.
""Did anyone predict this correctly? Anytime the equity market moves 7 percent in one day, the answer is no,"" said one investor in some of the world's biggest hedge funds.
An executive at a Europe-focused stock picker said its fund was down about 2 percent despite holding hedges against steep stock and currency declines. 
Other hedge fund investors welcomed the Brexit-induced volatility.
Arvin Soh, portfolio manager at GAM Alternative Investments Solutions, said he was pleased that ""something"" finally happened in the market, giving hedge funds the chance to benefit from dislocation.

""This,"" he said, ""will wind up being a good thing for managers.""

1591,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2016 06:22PM ET</span>",GBP/USD pares some losses after Brexit win pushes Pound to 31-year low,"Investing.com -- GBP/USD pared some losses after crashing more than 10% to 31-year lows, as the Bank of England and other top central banks tried to soothe markets in the wake of a historic decision by voters in the U.K. to leave the European Union.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.3231 and 1.4651 before settling at 1.3683, down 0.1194 or 8.03% on the session. With the crippling losses, the British Pound erased all of its gains from the previous week when it rose sharply against the dollar amid indications that a potential Brexit could be averted. The Pound Sterling is now down by more than 7% against its American counterpart since the start of the year when it opened above 1.47.
In London, U.K. prime minister David Cameron announced intentions to step down by October after the final tally in the controversial referendum showed that the Leave campaign prevailed by a 52-48% margin. While top global central bankers convened in Basel to execute an emergency contingency plan, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the Bank has set aside £250 billion of additional liquidity and will act if necessary to help support the British economy.
""Inevitably, there will be a period of uncertainty and adjustment following this result,"" Carney said on Friday morning. ""It will take some time for the United Kingdom to establish new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world, some market and economic volatility can be expected as this process unfolds. But we are well prepared for this…The Bank will not hesitate to take additional measures as required as those markets adjust and the UK economy moves forward.""
The precipitous fall in the Pound draws parallels to Black Wednesday on September 16, 1992 when the U.K. opted out of the EU's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). For the session, GBP/USD plunged 4.5% to 1.76 before falling to 1.69 in the subsequent week, down nearly 10% for the period. Investor George Soros, who reportedly made a profit of $1 billion betting against the Pound nearly a quarter century ago, said earlier this week that the Pound Sterling could tumble as much as 20% if the Brexit vote prevailed.
Moody's, one of the top three credit rating agencies in the world, downgraded the U.K.'s bond rating from stable to negative in response to the Brexit results. In reaching its decision, Moody's cited weaker domestic economic growth and the possibility for reduced fiscal strength from the government.
Yields on the U.K. 10-Year plunged 29 basis points to 1.08, while yields on the Germany 10-Year fell 14 basis points to Negative-0.05%, after falling to fresh record-lows earlier in the session. In the U.S., yields on 10-Year Treasuries dropped 19 basis points to 1.56%, hovering near their lowest level on record.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said in a statement on Friday morning that it is carefully monitoring market developments in cooperation with other central banks, in response to the results of the referendum. On Tuesday, Fed chair Janet Yellen told members of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee that a U.K. departure from the EU could have serious repercussions for financial markets worldwide.
""The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement.
Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said the uncertainty surrounding the referendum played a role in its decision to leave interest rates unchanged at its June monetary policy meeting. The FOMC has held the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its four meetings this year.
The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool responded to Friday's market developments by taking a September rate hike off the table. The CME Group also said there is a 17.8% probability the FOMC could raise the Fed Funds Rate to 0.50-0.75% in December, down from 42.6% one day earlier. In addition, the CME Group said there is a 12.7% chance the FOMC could lower rates to the zero-bound range in September. Last December, the FOMC halted a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising short-term rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 2.5% to a three-month high at 96.70, before falling back to 95.63 at the close. The index posted its strongest one-day move in more than five years."

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2016 06:36AM ET</span>","UK markets shudder after Brexit vote, sterling hits 31-year low","By Jamie McGeever and Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling plunged to its lowest in three decades and the value of London's big banks sank by the most since the 2008 financial crisis on Friday as Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union sparked turmoil on global financial markets.
The Bank of England's promise to provide 250 billion pounds of support and extra supplies of foreign currency if needed steadied the ship somewhat, halving initial losses for the FTSE 100 and the pound.
But sterling was still down more than 6 percent against the dollar by mid-morning in London, its biggest fall since the system of free-floating exchange rates was introduced in the early 1970s.
That reflected widespread alarm in the financial community over the uncertainty and volatility likely to be unleashed by the Brexit vote. London bankers who had worked through the night said it was the most volatile day's trading they had ever seen.
""The word 'unprecedented' is often used too much, and people often reach for the hyperbole. But this is truly unprecedented,"" said Steven Major, head of global rates strategy at HSBC in London.
HSBC cut its forecast for the pound to $1.20 and 92 pence per euro by the end of this year, and several other banks said they expected the value of the British currency to fall further. 
Traders said there had been strong buyers of sterling in Asia, however -- possibly including central bank reserve managers stocking up on the pound while it was at its cheapest in decades.
Sterling fell as low as $1.3305 , its weakest level against the dollar since September 1985, before recovering some ground to $1.3880.
The cost of insuring against swings in the sterling/dollar exchange rate jumped to 53.375 percent , the highest since at least 1998, before easing back.
""The pound fell a long way very quickly and the talk was that the speculative guys sold it on the first results last night and then bought it back,"" said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio management at currency fund Millennium Global. 
HELP
On stock markets, shares of Britain's big banks took the biggest hit, with HSBC (L:HSBA),  Barclays  (L:BARC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) all falling around 17 percent.
Ten-year UK government bond yields fell to 1.09 percent from around 1.38 percent late Thursday  and Citi and Goldman Sachs both predicted a fall below 1 percent as investors took cover in the perceived security of government debt.
But the biggest swings were in the foreign exchange market, dwarfing those seen on 'Black Wednesday' in 1992, when billionaire financier George Soros was instrumental in pushing the pound out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
""I'm one of the people who was here the last time we were trading at $1.35. It's back to the future, we're back to where we were in 1985,"" said Nick Parsons, co-head of global currency strategy at NAB. 
    ""We've had a 10 percent decline in six hours. That's simply extraordinary. And a vote to leave provides an existential crisis for Europe.""
All the major international and British banks in London, including Citi (N:C)  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JPMorgan (N:JPM), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Barclays (L:BARC) had traders either working through the night or on call.
On Citi's foreign exchange desk in London, dealers were only accepting voice orders and only desk heads had the authority to approve trades, according to a source at the bank.

Banks had warned clients about volatile trading conditions around the results which may lead to large gaps in prices. Barclays stopped accepting new ""stop loss"" orders as of 0600 GMT, an extremely rare move for one of the big six banks that dominate the world's biggest financial market.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling sank 10 percent in value to its weakest since before the 1985 Plaza Accord on Friday after Britain voted to leave the European Union, triggering a global rush of capital into the traditional security of the yen and the Swiss franc.
Alongside the biggest moves in the pound in living memory the euro, which is expected to struggle given worries about the impact of a ""Brexit"" on the euro zone economy, also dropped sharply against the dollar. 
The franc surged to its strongest in almost a year against the euro and the yen to its highest in more than two years. The Swiss National Bank became the first major central bank to step in to drive down the value of the franc, while speculation that the Bank of Japan could also act limited the yen's advance.
Japan said it would respond to ""extremely nervous"" exchange-rate moves, signaling a readiness to intervene.
The pound fell more than 10 percent to $1.3228 , its lowest since before the world's major economies signed a deal to weaken the dollar in September 1985. 
By 0830 GMT, it had recovered from those lows to trade at $1.3770, with traders citing Bank of England chief Mark Carney's comments that the central bank stood ready to provide extra support as a reason for the bounce.
Earlier, British Prime Minister David Cameron, who campaigned to stay in the EU said he will step down by October. Analysts expect months of economic and political turmoil which will dwarf the pressure on UK markets following sterling's ""Black Wednesday"" in 1992 when Britain was forced out of the pre-euro Exchange Rate Mechanism. 
""The UK has voted to leave the EU and this decision hits the British economy at a difficult time,"" said Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), adding investors' attention will shift to Britain's large current account of deficit of 7 percent and economic growth is likely to weaken.
Morgan Stanley expects the pound to fall to between $1.25 and $1.30.
Leading UK bank HSBC also cut its quarter end and year-end forecasts for sterling. It expects sterling to fall to $1.25 by the end of third-quarter and then to $1.20 by the end of 2016. It also cut its forecast for the euro for the end of the year to $1.10 from $1.20 previously. [L8N19G0RR]
EURO LOWER
Sterling also fell to its lowest in two years against the euro, with some expecting it to edge towards parity in coming months. The euro rose more than 8 percent to 83.15 pence (EURGBP=R), hitting its highest level in more than two years.
Yet the euro was under pressure against most other currencies as investors worried Brexit could fuel anti-establishment movements in other European countries. A new election is planned in Spain on Sunday after an inconclusive vote last December. 
The euro fell to $1.0912 , a low last seen in March, before recovering to $1.1140, still down 2 percent on the day. It fell nearly 2 percent against the franc, before recovering to trade just 0.7 percent lower at 1.0830 francs. (EURCHF=)
Demand for the safe-haven yen has grown steadily with Brexit anxiety over the past month. The greenback dropped to as low as 99.00 yen, a fall of 6.7 percent, before gaining a semblance of stability to trade at 103 yen. That was the first time it had fallen below the 100 mark since late 2013.
The rise in the yen kept alive the risk of intervention by the Japanese and perhaps even coordinated intervention by the Group of Seven countries. Deputy finance ministers of G7 nations will hold a conference call at 1130 GMT on Friday to discuss Britain's decision, a source familiar with the matter said.

""We will have to see how serious they are about any possible coordinated intervention by the G7,"" said Yujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura. ""While there is a risk of Japanese intervention, as long as dollar/yen remains above 100 yen chances are less.""

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, surged 2.52% to 95.68.
Updated poll figures on the U.K. referendum on membership of the European Union have led analysts and betting oddsmakers to expect a nearly split vote between ""Remain"" and ""Leave.""
Analysts at JP Morgan, based on results, said they were pointing to 51.5% to 48.5% for Leave, while bookies leaned that way as well. Sterling plunged on the early results, falling from close to $1.50 as the last polls were published to below $1.40.
The initial shock came from a crushing victory for 'Leave' in Sunderland in the north-east of England. There have since been a string of results that have been markedly stronger for 'Leave' than pundits had expected.
The one remaining hope for the Remain camp was that London would come out very strongly for staying in, with the first sizeable constituency, Lambeth, coming out 79% for 'Remain'.
Overnight, sterling and the euro pulled back from the day’s highs on Thursday amid jitters over the outcome of the historic referendum on whether the U.K. should remain in the European Union.
The pound hit the day’s highs after an opinion poll, conducted by polling company Ipsos MORI for the Evening Standard newspaper, indicated that the remain campaign was in the lead as voting continued in the landmark referendum.

Initial results in the U.K.'s referendum on membership of the European Union shook markets' earlier conviction that the Remain camp was on the way to victory.
The shock came from a crushing victory for Leave in Sunderland in the north-east of England, and only a narrow win for Remain in the neighbouring City of Newcastle. The results were markedly stronger for Leave than pundits had expected, but they may just be an early indicator of widely divergent regional voting patterns.
Leave won 61.3% of the vote in Sunderland and 49.3% in Newcastle.
Political leaders and officials, with the exception of UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, have avoided forecasting the result.
""I think that Remain might just nick it,"" Farage said.
The campaign evidence is that swathes of London have been solidly Remain. Against this there have been plenty of anecdotes of unhappy Labour politicians, who have seen strong Leave turnout in some of their traditional northern heartlands.
The Labour leadership backed Remain, while distancing itself from the stay campaign spearheaded by the Conservative leadership.

The British Pound reached a session-high of 1.5002 against the dollar just after 5:15 Eastern Standard Time, its highest level since December 16, before falling back below 1.50 shortly after. With a frenzied night of trading expected, the Pound is on pace to gain more than 1.75% versus the dollar on the session. Over the last week, as widespread concerns of a Brexit have faded, the Pound sterling has surged more than 6% against its American counterpart.
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.3852, the low from Feb. 26 and was met with resistance at 1.4935, the high from Dec. 21.
On Thursday evening, results from a You Gov telephone poll found that the Stay campaign clung to a 52-48% lead in the first public opinion survey released since Brexit polls closed minutes earlier. It marked a slight uptick from You Gov polling data earlier this week, which indicated that the Leave campaign trailed by a margin of 51-49%. Notably, the poll of 5,000 U.K. citizens is not regarded as an official exit poll. Currency traders await the results from voting in the Sunderland region, the first regional polling data scheduled for release, for clearer indications on the winner in the historic referendum. Results in Sunderland are expected to be released at 7:30 EST, while the official results may not be released until before 3 a.m. EST on Friday morning.
A grim Nigel Farage appeared close to conceding defeat, telling Sky News that its seems the Remain side will ""edge it,"" as polls closed. A day earlier, Farage, the head of the UK Independence Party, took to Twitter to urge voters to head to the polls and ""help make history."" Over the last few weeks, leading economists have expressed widespread fears that a vote paving the way for the U.K. to leave the European Union could trigger a recession throughout the euro zone. In the days leading up to the vote, billionaire investor George Soros has warned that the Pound could tumble 20% if the Leave vote is successful. 
Meanwhile, leading politicians from the G7 and currency traders on desks throughout London are bracing for a long evening, potentially fraught with extreme volatility on foreign exchange markets worldwide. Executives at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) told CNBC that they have plans to execute stop-loss orders on the sterling trade on Friday as a protection for major fluctuations in the British currency. A stop-loss order on the pound is an order to buy or sell sterling at a pre-established price, helping limit potential losses.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.50% to an intraday low of 93.03, falling to fresh one-month lows. On Thursday evening, the index pared some losses, returning back to 93.33. Nevertheless, the index is down by more than 5% since early-December."

Reduced Brexit fears have helped sterling gain roughly three percent so far this week, although several poll results have been too close to call a definitive outcome.
The pound was up 0.6 percent at $1.4793  after touching $1.4847, its highest since the beginning of the year.
A wait-and-see mood was expected to prevail through the rest of the day, dotted by possible bouts of volatility, as markets nervously awaited the British poll results.
""It will be hard for the market move until the poll results are released. The pound obviously will take center stage. But other European currencies and particularly dollar/yen also bear watching as the pair will reflect swings in risk sentiment,"" said Shin Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Tokyo.
The polling will take place between 0600-2100 GMT on Thursday, with the results expected early on Friday.
Poll results may not be published during voting hours but financial market prices could be affected by independent surveys conducted by some private institutions, analysts said.
WIDE SWINGS EYED
The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 104.645 yen  after moving the previous day in a narrow 104.855-104.310 range.
The greenback has sagged against the yen after Tuesday's testimony by Federal Reserve Janet Yellen was seen to have played down the chances of a U.S. interest rate increase in July.
The euro extended overnight gains, rising 0.4 percent to $1.1338 . A slight ebb in prospects of Britain leaving the EU has helped the common currency.
Sterling climbed to a two-week high of 154.75 yen (GBPJPY=R). JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) expects sterling would surge towards $1.51 and the dollar rally to around 108 yen if Britons opt to stick with the EU. But it saw the pound tank towards $1.32 and dollar/yen retreat to around 101 in the event of a Brexit vote. 
The safe-haven yen is thought likely to appreciate sharply on a Brexit, which would raise the prospect of actual market intervention by Japanese authorities.
""If dollar/yen falls below 100 and the yen rises broadly against emerging currencies and the pound, Japanese authorities could switch from verbal to actual intervention,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""They could intervene as it would not be about raising Japan's competitiveness, but rather reacting against abnormal market moves that threaten the economy,"" he said.
The Australian dollar, seen as a rough proxy of risk sentiment, was up 0.3 percent at $0.7519 , not far from a seven-week high of $0.7527 scaled overnight.

The currency pair traded between 1.4642 and 1.4775 before settling at 1.4768, up 0.0103 or 0.41% on the session. The Pound has closed higher against the U.S. Dollar in four of the last five sessions. Since the tragic assassination of Labour Party parliament member Jo Cox last week, the Pound Sterling has surged more than 5% against its American counterpart.
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.3852, the low from Feb. 26 and was met with resistance at 1.4935, the high from Dec. 21.
Hours before polls opened in an enormously consequential Brexit referendum, the Pound pared some gains in U.S. afternoon trading before settling near-session highs. Following the close of markets throughout the euro area, a poll from Opinium showed that the Exit vote had taken a slight 45-44% lead, while a TNS survey found that the Leave camp jumped in front by a 43-41% margin, with 16% undecided. Still, British sportsbook  Ladbrokes  (LON:LAD) placed the probability of Remaining at 73% based on its live odds, down slightly from a 76% chance earlier this week. Notably, it will take the U.K. a minimum of two years to leave the European Union even if the Exit campaign prevails.
At the same time, analysts at UBS added a twist by offering predictions that the FTSE could plummet by 20% if the U.K. decides to leave the European Union. A day earlier, billionaire investor George Soros said the British Pound could also fall 20% given such a scenario. On Black Wednesday, nearly 25 years ago, Soros bet correctly against the Pound when the U.K. opted out of the EU's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). In the ensuing week, the Pound tumbled 10%.
Over the last few months, prominent politicians and economists such as U.K. prime minister David Cameron, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde have issued stark warnings on the ramifications of a potential Brexit. At the same time, House of Commons Leader Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and former London mayor Boris Johnson have shown support for the Leave movement.
EUR/GBP fell 0.26% to 0.76656, while EUR/USD rose 0.31% to 1.1332.
In Washington D.C., Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated her stance that a vote supporting a Brexit could have serious consequences on the global economy and financial markets. In testimony on Capitol Hill, Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee that she has yet to schedule an emergency meeting at week's end in the likelihood that the Remain camp is defeated.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.45% to an intraday low of 93.50, before rallying in the U.S. afternoon session to 93.81. The index is down by more than 5% since early-December.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2016 10:29AM ET</span>","Dollar weakens, impending Brexit vote lifts sterling, euro","By Dion Rabouin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was broadly weaker on Wednesday as risk appetite returned to markets, boosting higher-risk currencies, while sterling and the euro rose on the last day of campaigning before Britain's referendum on European Union membership.
A swing in bookmaker odds towards Britain choosing to remain in the EU, following the murder of a British lawmaker last week, helped boost currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars, considered riskier investments because of their ties to commodity prices. 
The shift also helped sterling to recover 5 percent from lows around $1.40 last week.
""Part of it is gradually more and more the risk from Brexit being removed, something that started last week when we saw the polls changing around,"" said Charles St-Arnaud, senior strategist and economist at Nomura Securities International in London.
That bolstered the Australian and New Zealand dollar, St-Arnaud said: ""Being the highest-paying currencies in the developed world, they’re gaining quite a bit.""
The Australian dollar  rose 0.75 percent against its U.S. counterpart to $0.7498. The New Zealand dollar  gained 0.72 percent to $0.7167. Both Australia and New Zealand currently boast higher interest rates than the United States, making them attractive to investors.
Sterling  rose to $1.4697, up 0.35 percent from its levels late Tuesday, and a little more than a cent below its 2016 high. 
While the so-called Brexit vote continues to dominate minds, testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday was seen by some as playing down the chances of a hike in U.S. interest rates in July.
The dollar fell by about 0.2 percent to 104.59 yen <JPY=> and was 0.35 percent lower against the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength (DXY). It fell 0.6 percent against the euro <EUR=> to $1.1307.
""Obviously depending on the result, but if the U.K. (votes to remain in the EU) then the focus of international investors will turn to 'What’s the next big event?'"" St-Arnaud said. ""And it’ll be 'OK, can the Fed really hike in July?' And even, 'Can they really hike in September?'""
That will turn markets' focus very rapidly to June's U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which will be released next week, St-Arnaud said.

U.S. interest rate markets price in only a 9.5 percent chance of an increase in official borrowing costs next month and only a 31 percent chance of a hike in September, according to the CME Group's Fedwatch tool.

Two prominent sportsbooks,  Ladbrokes  (LON:LAD) and Betfair, meanwhile, said approximately 25% of all wagers have been staked on the Leave vote.
In Brussels, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi underlined the potential risks of a Brexit and said the Governing Council has contingency plans in place in the event that the Leave vote prevails. Draghi's comments preceded testimony from Janet Yellen before Capitol Hill, where the Federal Reserve chair said a departure by the U.K. could create increased volatility in financial markets throughout the euro area. Pressed further by legislators, Yellen later testified that a Brexit might lead to a ""risk-off"" environment in U.S. markets that could create a spike in the dollar and weigh on exports.
In addition, Yellen told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that the Federal Open Market Committee  is hesitant to raise interest rates for the foreseeable future amid continued uncertainty in the global economy and a weak inflation outlook. Citing slow economic and financial developments in China and the euro area, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth, Yellen said the Fed expects interest rates to remain below their long-term outlook due to the temporary headwinds.
""Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly. Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate,"" Yellen said. ""We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with their attainment over time.
Elsewhere, billionaire investor George Soros warned that the Pound could fall by as much as 20% versus the dollar if the U.K. leaves the European bloc. In 1992, Soros bet correctly against the Pound when the sterling fell 15%, after the U.K. opted out of the EU's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). On Tuesday, Soros cautioned that a potential Brexit could have more serious implications than the aforementioned event, commonly referred to as ""Black Wednesday.""

In prepared testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Yellen outlined how the central bank was thrown off course within weeks of raising rates last December by a slowdown in domestic growth and international events.
Some of those clouds remain, Yellen said in comments that seemed to signal no pressing need for the Fed to raise rates.
The Fed president also said the Brexit referendum on Thursday is considered a possible flashpoint for the global economy if Britain decides to cut its ties with the EU.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling hit a seven-week high against the dollar on Tuesday, getting a lift from recent opinion polls that have edged back in favor of the campaign for Britain to stay in the European Union and which has diminished appetite for safe-haven currencies. 
Two opinion polls on Monday showed that the ""Remain"" camp has recovered some ground in Britain's European Union referendum debate, but a third poll found those wanting to leave were ahead by a whisker. 
The implied probability of a ""Remain"" vote in Thursday's referendum was at around 75 percent having fallen to as low as 60 percent last Thursday, according to odds from gaming website Betfair. For the latest Reuters news on the referendum including full multimedia coverage, click 
Sterling  rose 0.4 percent to $1.4747, its highest since early May. On Monday, it climbed 2.1 percent against the dollar, its biggest one-day gain since late 2008, as investors and speculators cut bets against the pound.
""Some of the recent events have been favorable for Britain to remain in the EU, but it's still too close to call,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""We are advising our clients to go neutral into the vote, although we remain constructive. If ""Remain"" wins we expect sterling to rise to $1.55.""
George Soros, the hedge fund billionaire who earned fame by betting against the pound in 1992, said a vote to leave would trigger a bigger and more disruptive sterling devaluation than the fall on ""Black Wednesday"". He said the pound would fall by at least 15 percent, and possibly more than 20 percent, to below $1.15, if Britain opted to leave.
The euro was flat against the pound at 77 pence (EURGBP=D4), not far from Monday's near three-week low of 76.925 pence.
Against the dollar, the euro  edged up 0.2 percent to $1.1330 , moving in sympathy with the pound. Traders expect the euro to be boosted against most major currencies like the dollar and the yen if Britain chooses to stay in the EU.
Traders will keep an eye on a ruling by Germany's top court on the legality of an emergency ECB bond-buying scheme, although its not expected to have a major impact on the euro.
""That can either be due to the fact that nobody expects the German constitutional court to not completely share the European Court of Justice's view -- which is unlikely as none of the experts expect this-- or that nobody expects today's decision to have an effect on the ECB's current monetary policy,"" said Esther Reichelt, strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.4532 and 1.4719 before settling at 1.4699, up 2.30% on the session.

The market responded by downgrading the odds of monetary policy tightening through December. On Friday, Federal Reserve of St. Louis president James Bullard shifted his hawkish positioning by suggesting that the FOMC may only need to lift short-term rates once over the next two-and-a-half years given the current low interest global backdrop.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.

The central bank sold $530 million for 280 naira per dollar at a special auction and later sold a further $86.5 million directly on the interbank market at 281 to 285 naira, traders said.
Monday's rate was notably weaker than the 197 peg the central bank had maintained for 16 months before abandoning it last week in a bid to alleviate chronic forex shortages and stop the economy from sliding into recession.
The naira had traded just twice by midday, before the central bank held its special auction to clear a backlog of hard currency orders. Less than $1 million had changed hands, prompting an extension of the trading day to 5 p.m. (1600 GMT), dealers said. 
Black market currency dealers were quoting the naira at 325 to 345 naira to the dollar, up to 10 percent stronger than on Friday, on expectations more hard currency liquidity on the interbank market would reduce demand on the street. 
The central bank has said it may inject foreign exchange into the interbank market to increase liquidity and reduce a backlog of $4 billion backlog of demand, which could take four weeks to clear.
""We suspect that the best way to talk about the new exchange rate regime is still as a managed float, but a managed float that is responsive to market forces,"" Citi analysts said in a note. ""The new structure does provide a platform for the CBN (central bank) to easily step further away from the market.""
Non-deliverable forwards - contracts used to bet on future exchange rate moves - priced the naira at 302 per dollar in one month's time . They initially weakened to a record 310 to the dollar.
The two-month contract < NGN2MNDFOR=> saw the naira at 313 per dollar in August. One year down the line < NGN1YNDFOR=> the naira was priced at 355.
Nigeria's central bank is ""reasonably optimistic"" the naira will settle around 250 to the dollar after an initial period of weakness following a flotation, the bank's governor said in a June 3 letter to President Muhammadu Buhari.
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
Foreign investors and economists had called for a naira devaluation for months as the shortages of foreign exchange undermined economic growth and led to widespread capital flight.
The central bank said last week it would abandon the peg in a ""managed float"". The median forecast from 10 analysts surveyed by Reuters had suggested the naira might trade on Monday at as much as 300 naira per dollar. 
Nigeria's economy, which contracted by 0.4 percent in the first quarter, faces its worst crisis in decades as a result of the decline in oil prices since 2014 and last year's introduction of the currency peg.
With the naira expected to fall sharply, Nigerian products will become relatively cheap and imports more expensive. That should stimulate the domestic economy, but it is also likely to light a fire under already rising inflation.
""The new system should reduce the shortage of FX in the economy and - in the long run - reduce strains in the balance of payments by discouraging imports and boosting export competitiveness,"" said John Ashbourne of Capital Economics.
""But the new system certainly does not mark the end of Nigeria’s economic problems.""

The OPEC oil exporter had resisted devaluing the naira for more than a year, while other major oil producers, including Russia, Kazakhstan and Angola, allowed their currencies to fall after crude prices collapsed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling rallied on Monday after opinion polls swung in favor of the campaign for Britain to stay in the European Union, boosting risk sentiment and sending the safe-haven yen tumbling.
The implied probability of a ""Remain"" vote in Thursday's referendum rose to 72 percent after falling as low as 60 percent last Thursday, according to odds from gambling website Betfair.

Investors reacted after three of six opinion polls published over the weekend showed a shift towards keeping Britain in the EU, with some citing the killing last week of pro-EU lawmaker Jo Cox as a factor.
""The outcome of the referendum is wide open again,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""But at least ""Leave"" no longer seems the most likely scenario. Should the next polls suggest that the change of sentiment persists euro/sterling may ease further.""

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.4199 and 1.4388 before settling at 1.4207, up 1.10% on the session. With the sharp gains, the Pound Sterling enjoyed its strongest one-day move against the dollar in more than a month. At session-lows on Thursday, the pair tested 1.40, its lowest level since early-March. The Pound has still slid more than 1.25% over the last week amid mounting concerns that voters could support a referendum to leave the European Union next Thursday. 
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.3852, the low from Feb. 26 and was met with resistance at 1.4693, the high from May 27. 
On Friday, a series of events ahead of next week's Brexit referendum were cancelled, as U.K. residents continued to mourn Jo Cox, a Labour Party member who was shot and stabbed to death in North Yorkshire a day earlier. Cox, who was elected to the House of Commons last year, had openly campaigned for the ""Remain"" camp in recent weeks. It marked the first killing of a Parliament member in two decades. Out of respect for Cox, several public opinion polls and a report by the International Monetary Fund were delayed until the weekend.
Voters in the U.K. appear to be evenly split on whether to support a departure by the U.K. from the European Union. While the ""Remain"" campaign held as much as a 70-30 lead several months ago, the ""Leave,"" vote has surged ahead in several prominent polls this week. Still, the British sportsbook Betfair helped assuage concerns of a Brexit by reporting that approximately 65% of the wagers it has handled have come in for the ""Remain,"" side. In recent weeks, British prime minister David Cameron, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde and Bank of England governor Mark Carney have warned of the serious ramifications a Brexit could have on global financial markets. On the other end, House of Commons Leader Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and former London mayor Boris Johnson have shown support for the Leave movement.
Meanwhile, investors continued to digest the Fed's decision earlier this week to leave the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged  at a level between 0.25% and 0.50%. At the same time, six members of the FOMC recommended one interest rate hike before the end of this year, up from one in March. Last December, the FOMC forecasted in its quarterly economic projections. that it could raise rates as much as four times in 2016.
St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said Friday that the U.S. central bank may only need to raise rates once over the next two and a half years, amid a historically low interest rate environment among other top central banks worldwide. By comparison, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan left key interest rates in negative territory earlier this month. Bullard's comments represent a stark departure from his position less than a month ago when he argued at a speech in Singapore that keeping rates too low for an extended period could ""feed into future financial instability.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.50% to a one-week low of 94.17, before settling at 94.31. The index is down by more than 5% since early-December.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose three basis points to 1.61%, bouncing off four-year lows from the previous session. Yields on the Germany 10-Year surged four basis points to 0.02%, earlier this week yields on German bunds turned negative for the first time on record. "

NEW YOKR (Reuters) - Sterling and bond yields rose on Friday as traders tried to assess whether the killing of a pro-EU British lawmaker may change the balance of opinions in Britain's impending referendum on European Union membership.
After a tumultuous week, U.S. stocks were lower in early New York trading, though MSCI's all-country world stock index (MIWD00000PUS) was up 0.5 percent and the FTSEurofirst 300 (FTEU3) gained 1.1 percent.
Campaigning for Britain's June 23 EU referendum, which overshadowed this week's U.S. and Japanese central bank meetings, was put on hold after British Member of Parliament Jo Cox was shot dead on Thursday.
Concerns Britain would cause turmoil in the global economy and European politics by voting to leave the 28-country bloc had rattled markets and caused the pound to tumbled earlier this week.
“This is people adjusting positions because they don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. “People are unwinding the ‘risk off’ trades for the most part.”
The sterling  was last up 0.58 percent at $1.4285, up from Thursday's lows of 1.4010. Analysts noted that Cox's death could generate sentiment in favor of remaining in the EU.
U.S. benchmark Treasury yields were on track for their first gain in nearly two weeks as fears of a British exit from the EU eased somewhat.
The 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) fell 13/32 in price to yield 1.608 percent. Yields are on track for their first rise since June 6.
STOCKS SLIP, OIL UP
U.S. stocks were lower on lingering worries about global growth. The S&P 500 snapped a five-day losing streak on Thursday.
The Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) was down 87.73 points, or 0.49 percent, to 17,645.37, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 10.51 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,067.48 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 43.39 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,801.52.
Oil, which has been a major driver of the sharp swings in global markets this year, also helped shift the mood as it rose for the first time in seven sessions.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up $1.34 at $48.53 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) rose $1.31 to $47.52.
The two contracts were set to end the week roughly 3.5-4 percent lower.

Gold also advanced, with spot gold  rising to $1,292.90, after wild swings overnight. It was on track for a third week of gains.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling rose half a percent in early London trading on Friday and the euro added to gains in the past 24 hours on expectations that the killing of a pro-EU British lawmaker may alter the balance of opinion in Britain's referendum on EU membership. 
Speculation was rife among traders after the murder of Jo Cox on Thursday that Prime Minister David Cameron might push back the vote due to take place on June 23.
There has been no such signal from Downing Street, but either way some traders think the murder will turn the tide of public opinion after a series of polls showed the ""Leave"" campaign moving ahead. 
Concerns Britain would send a shockwave through global financial markets and European politics by voting to leave the 28-country bloc have prompted a flood of money into traditional safe havens such as the yen and the Swiss franc. 
""For now the bounce is only really visible in sterling,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) strategist Michael Sneyd said. 
""The biggest move this week has been the shift in Fed expectations, which we have seen in surge in the yen against the dollar. What's interesting is the euro has not reacted, which suggests there has been an increase in risk on the euro itself."" 
By 1120 GMT, sterling was up 0.6 percent at $1.4276, almost 3 cents above Thursday's lows. It also gained 0.2 percent to 78.85 pence per euro. The single currency firmed a third of a percent to $1.1257  from a two-week low of $1.1131. 
The cost of hedging against volatility in sterling and the euro over the next week hit multi-year highs, however, reflecting the risk of a sharp move either way for both next Thursday. 
The yen also remained within sight of almost two-year highs of 103.55 yen hit against the dollar on Thursday. 
""Past the date of the referendum, asset prices are likely to move sharply, regardless of the outcome of the referendum,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists said in a note on Friday.

Analysts from  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) closed some risk-averse bets in response to Thursday's events and a minimal recovery in investors' appetite for risk overnight, but they remained cautious. 
""We believe it is premature to conclude that the risk of Brexit will abate from here,"" they said in a note.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2016 02:20AM ET</span>",Mrs Watanabe may add to sterling chaos if Britain leaves Europe,"By Noriyuki Hirata
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail investors, collectively nicknamed Mrs Watanabe, are building huge positions in pound sterling and may be among the first victims of market turmoil should Britain vote to leave the European Union next week.
Polls close at 10 pm UK time on June 23 and vote counting will go through the British night, meaning Japanese investors will be among the first in the world to react next Friday and help set the tone for other markets. 
With the market so unbalanced in favor of long sterling positions, a ""Leave"" vote could trigger automatic stop-loss orders en masse, driving steep falls and large swings in the currency, some currency experts warn.
Long sterling positions are 20 times larger than short positions on the Tokyo Financial Exchange, which has about 30 percent of the market in margin forex trading in terms of client assets, and are skewed in favor of heavy buying in sterling on Japan's other platforms.
These platforms account for about 30 percent of Tokyo's currency market, according to Bank of Japan estimates.
""Many people are buying because the pound looks cheap. Quite a few of them are buying pounds simply because it is at historic low levels,"" said an official at margin forex trading company.
""And some are just gambling that Britain must remain in Europe,"" he said.
The pound has fallen to three-year low of 145.63 yen this week, down more than 25 percent from a 7-year high of 195.86 yen hit about a year ago.
If Britain votes to leave, Mrs Watanabe's loss-cutting could make the already volatile currency market even more unstable.
""Their loss-cutting, whether voluntary or forced, could exacerbate selling in the pound, that could help make entire markets more risk-off,"" said Tuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research.
As sterling trading in Tokyo is far less liquid than that in the U.S. dollar, Mrs Watanabe's selling of sterling could exacerbate price moves.
In fact, financial markets got a taste earlier this year of just how Mrs Watanabe's trading can inject huge volatility into global markets and how it can spread to other currencies.
On Jan. 11, the South African rand plunged about 6 percent against the yen in just 30 minutes when Japanese investors were forced to cut losses after U.S. payroll data the previous Friday changed the market's view.
The day before, Mrs Watanabe's long position in the rand was 13 times larger than her short positions.
The sharp price move affected other currency pairs, too, pushing the U.S. dollar down about 0.5 percent before the market stabilized. 
To be sure, that rout happened very early on a Monday before most Asian market players start trading and liquidity was at its lowest.
Yet Tokyo traders warn that the referendum result could come out early in Asian trading hours next Friday.
""If we see the headline that Britain is leaving Europe, we could well see a fall of a few hundred pips in the pound/yen instantly,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.4013 and 1.4254 before settling at 1.4207, up 0.09% on the session. Since eclipsing 1.45 last week, the Pound Sterling has tumbled more than 2.3% against the dollar. The pound remains close to falling to near one-year lows of 1.3833 in late-February. The pair last fell below 1.40 in early-March. 
GBP/USD likely gained support at 1.3852, the low from Feb. 26 and was met with resistance at 1.4693, the high from May 27. 
As investors continued to digest a relatively dovish monetary policy statement from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England (BOE) followed suit by maintaining its bank rate at 0.5% and holding the level of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £375 billion. Notably, the BOE issued stark warnings on the ramifications that could ensue from a ""Leave,"" vote in next week's controversial Brexit referendum. 
""The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets,"" the Bank of England said in a statement. ""While consumer spending has been solid, there is growing evidence that uncertainty about the referendum is leading to delays to major economic decisions that are costly to reverse, including commercial and residential real estate transactions, car purchases, and business investment.""
The BOE's comments pushed the implied volatility on the British Pound to near record-highs on Thursday. Foreign Exchange traders also reacted to news that British MP Jo Cox passed away after she was shot and stabbed by an attacker in West Yorkshire. News of the tragedy raised speculation that the Brexit referendum could be delayed. Some concerns of a U.K. departure, however, were assuaged after betting odds from the U.K. sportsbook Betfair indicated that there is a 65% chance the ""Remain"" vote will prevail next week.
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25% and 0.50%. It marked the fourth consecutive meeting the FOMC held short-term interest rates steady. The FOMC left its 2016 rate outlook unchanged at 0.9%, while downgrading its forecast for each of the next two years. In addition, six members of the FOMC recommended one interest rate hike before the end of this year, up from one in March. By comparison, the FOMC estimated that it would raise interest rates four times this year in its long-term forecasts last December. 
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, soared more than 0.50% to an intraday-high of 95.53, before falling back to 94.77 at the close of U.S. afternoon trading. The index is still down by more than 5% since early-December.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2016 09:06AM ET</span>",Yen soars after Bank of Japan refrains from further easing,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen surged by more than 2 percent against the dollar on Thursday to hit a 22-month high, after the Bank of Japan held off from expanding its monetary stimulus programme and the U.S. Federal Reserve struck a cautious tone. 
The safe-haven yen, which also hit multi-year highs against the euro (EURJPY=) and sterling (GBPJPY=), has climbed 7 percent against the dollar  since the start of June as worries that Britain could vote to leave the European Union in a referendum next week have prompted a flight to safety.
Because of that rise, as well as anaemic inflation in Japan, some investors had expected the BOJ to offer some further easing measures. Its failure to do so sent the dollar to as low as 103.555 yen , down around 2.3 percent on the day. 
The greenback had already been weakened late on Wednesday by a statement and news conference from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which lowered its economic growth forecasts, cementing expectations that it will not tighten policy next month. The Fed did, nevertheless, signal that it was still planning to raise interest rates twice this year.
""If the Fed and BOJ had done opposite things – if the Fed had been a bit more hawkish, and if the BOJ was a bit more dovish ... that would have pushed dollar/yen higher. But neither of those things happened,"" said UBS's director of currency strategy, Constantin Bolz, in Zurich.
By 1140 GMT the greenback had edged back up to 104.40 yen, after BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said at a news conference that the central bank ""won't hesitate in taking additional easing steps if needed"" to reach its 2 percent inflation target. But that still left the yen up 1.6 percent on the day. 
UBS's Bolz said a slightly less risk-averse mood had taken hold across markets than earlier in the day, which had also weakened the yen a touch. 
In London,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) currency strategist Alvin Tan said the yen's surge was more down to the Fed's dovish stance than the BOJ's refraining from further easing, which had been expected.
Tan added that the yen's rise had been exacerbated by the triggering of a large number of stops around 105.60 yen, which he said was a key technical level.
The Swiss National Bank, which, like the BOJ, faces unwanted safe-haven demand for its currency, kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. But SNB Governor Thomas Jordan said the central bank would be closely watching Britain's EU vote next week, and would ""take measures if required"".
The Swiss franc gained a touch after those comments to trade flat on the day at 1.08215 francs per euro (EURCHF=). But that still left it close to a six-month high of 1.0791 hit earlier in the week.

“On the evidence of the recent behavior of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling’s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply”, the minutes said.
The bank warned that a vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation.
The minutes also said that top policymakers had been briefed on contingency planning as it prepares measures to prevent markets seizing up in the event of a leave vote next week.

Indeed, globally the greenback was on the defensive after the Fed lowered its economic growth forecasts and scaled back its rate hike projections, cementing expectations that it will have to skip tightening next month.

""The yuan had factored in the Fed's latest stance,"" said a dealer at a European bank in Shanghai, and so traders brushed aside a higher official fix. 
The People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.5739 per dollar prior to the market open, 0.4 percent firmer than the previous fix of 6.6001, which was the weakest official fix in more than five years.
Some traders said that Thursday's higher midpoint was also in line with China's recent reforms to allow increased two-way volatility in its currency as authorities gradually build up a more market-oriented exchange rate regime.
""More volatility in the yuan of late indicates that the authorities are serious about reforming the mechanisms to price the yuan's exchange rate,"" said Huang Yi, head of foreign exchange trading at China Guangfa Bank in Shanghai.

While the FOMC left its median Federal Funds Rate forecast for 2016 unchanged at 0.9%, six members of the FOMC recommended just one rate hike by the end of the year. In the FOMC's last projections in March, only one member of the Committee recommended a single rate hike in 2016. By comparison, the FOMC said in median projections in December that it could implement as many as four rate hikes this year. Notably, the FOMC lowered its median projection for the Fed Funds Rate in 2017 by 0.25% to 1.6%. The FOMC also cut the median projection on the Fed Funds Rate outlook for 2018 by 0.625% to 2.4%.
At a press conference following the release, Fed chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the so-called neutral rate or level of the Federal Funds Rate when the economy is at full employment is ""quite depressed by historical standards."" Yellen blamed headwinds from low productivity growth rates throughout the world and an aging society for depressing the neutral rate. The weak projections for the long-term path of the neutral rate prompted FOMC members to lower their forecasts for the Federal Funds Rate through 2018, Yellen added. 
""To the extent that there are headwinds many of us expect that these headwinds will diminish gradually over time and that's a reason why you see the upward path,"" Yellen said. ""I think you see a downward shift in what is causing this neutral rate to be low are factors that are not rapidly disappearing, but will be part of the new normal.""
Yellen also said that next week's Brexit vote on whether the U.K. will remain in the European Union factored into Wednesday's decision.
""Clearly this is a very important decision for the United Kingdom and for Europe,"" Yellen said. ""It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets. If it does so, it could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, as expected, and lowered its economic growth forecasts for this year and next, suggesting it would be less aggressive in tightening policy after 2016.
Against the yen, the dollar dropped to its lowest in more than two years after the Fed statement.
The Fed did signal that it still plans two hike rates twice this year as it expects the U.S. jobs market to strengthen, but the futures market believed otherwise.
Fed funds futures, based on the CME Group's FedWatch, moved to price in just a 10 percent perceived chance of a July rate hike. Chances of a September hike were placed at 26 percent, while the odds for a November and December rate rise were under 50 percent.
""The tone of the statement is absolutely dovish and that was reflected in the fact that the dollar was sold off, not super aggressively, but we did see it move,"" said Joe O'Leary, senior foreign exchange trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
""With what's going on globally, I don't think the Fed will be as aggressive in raising rates as it once was a couple of months ago.""
Yellen, in a press briefing after the meeting, said one reason for keeping U.S. rates steady was uncertainty surrounding an upcoming referendum to determine whether Britain would leave the European Union.
In afternoon trading, the dollar fell to 105.50 yen , the lowest since mid-October 2014. It has since recovered to 105.97, down 0.1 percent
The euro also gained against the dollar, up 0.5 percent to $1.1265 , and rising 0.4 percent versus the yen to 119.39 yen (EURJPY=).
The dollar index overall slid 0.3 percent to 94.606 (DXY).
With the Fed out of the way, the focus has shifted again to Brexit.
Betting odds indicate the implied probability of a British vote to stay in the EU is 62 percent, according to Betfair. The implied probability of an In vote fell on Tuesday to around 55 percent, then recovered to 62 percent later in the day.
""The initial impact of a Brexit on the euro should be negative as fears about the growth outlook and the integrity of the EU will fuel expectations of more ECB (European Central Bank) easing,"" wrote  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) in a research note.

But the bank doubted that Brexit will lead to the demise of the EU. It also believes that euro weakness will not be sustained over the longer term.

The Chinese currency hit an intraday low of 6.6047 per dollar in early trade, the lowest since January 2011, after the People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.6001 per dollar prior to the market open. The fixing was also the softest since January 2011.
Spot yuan opened at 6.6020 per dollar, breaching critical support at 6.60. By midday, it had pared some losses and was changing hands at 6.5951, 0.02 percent firmer than the previous close.
Concerns that Britain may vote to leave the European Union in a referendum next week continued to rattle global financial markets and policymakers.
Chinese traders agreed that such a scenario could trigger another round of massive yuan depreciation if it causes chaos on world markets.
""The impact of Brexit on the global markets is irreversible,"" said a trader at a Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai. ""My estimate is that the yuan will, at the very least, further weaken 200 or 300 pips.""
Chances that the Fed will raise interest rates this week are considered to be virtually nil, but markets will be watching for comments on its rate outlook for the rest of the year.

In Australia, the Westpac consumer sentiment index for June dipped 1%, a sharp reversal from the previous reading of 8.5%.
""The Reserve Bank (of Australia) Board next meets on July 5. A move at that meeting is highly unlikely. The key considerations for the bank are around the outlook for inflation,"" said Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan. ""On its current forecasts the RBA does not expect inflation to return to the bottom of the band until 2017, and that is on the assumption of a further rate cut, given that the Bank's forecasts are based on 'market pricing' for rates. The most important and immediate information about whether the RBA's May assessment is correct will come from the June quarter inflation report, which prints on July 27, after the July Board meeting but ahead of the August 2 meeting. It is our assessment that the information in this report will confirm to the board that another cut is indeed necessary.""
The Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day June monetary policy meeting, with a closely-watched interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon.
While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not expected to raise short-term interest rates at the meeting, Fed chair Janet Yellen could provide clues on whether the U.S. central bank could lift rates before the end of the fall.

The currency pair traded between 1.1189 and 1.1298 before settling at 1.1206, down 0.73% on the session. The euro has closed lower against the dollar in three of the last four sessions. Since clearing 1.14 last week, the euro has fallen by more than 1.25% against its American counterpart. Nevertheless, EUR/USD is up by more than 3% since starting the year below 1.09.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1055, the low from March 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1616, the high from May 3.
Foreign exchange traders continued to keep a close eye on poll results in the U.K., which increasingly show a British public shifting their support to the ""Leave,"" campaign, ahead of next week's controversial Brexit referendum. An online poll from TNS said a Leave vote widened its lead over a vote to ""Stay"" by a 47-40 margin, as Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper backed a campaign to depart from the European Union. Another survey, a YouGov poll for The Times, found that the ""Leave"" vote held a 46-39% lead, while 11% remained undecided. It came days after a popular columnist from The Telegraph broke ranks with the British establishment and supported a vote to leave. Last week, the Remain campaign held a slight one point lead in the same YouGov poll. 
In recent weeks, a number of top political leaders and economists including U.K. prime minister David Cameron, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde have issued stark warnings in recent weeks on the ramifications a British departure from the EU could have on the global economy at large. On the other end, House of Commons Leader Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and former London mayor Boris Johnson have shown support for the Leave movement. 
GBP/USD plunged more than 1.15% to an intraday-low of 1.4091. Over the last three weeks, the British pound has fallen more than 2.62% versus the U.S. dollar. In Tuesday's session, British pound volatility hit its highest level in two decades. 
Yields on German 10-year bunds tumbled to a record low at Minus-0.034 before rallying slightly to Minus-0.008, as risk-adverse traders continued to pile into safe-haven assets, pushing yields lower. As a result, financial stocks throughout the euro zone tumbled on Tuesday. Shares in both  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) NA O.N. (NYSE:DB) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG (NYSE:CS) fell sharply, each touching down to fresh record-lows during the session. In Asia, yields on the Japan 5-Year fell to a record-low at Minus-0.28%.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2016 08:00AM ET</span>",Yen hits three-year highs vs euro as Brexit worries mount,"By Patrick Graham
LONDON (Reuters) - The yen surged to its strongest level against the euro for more than three years on Tuesday as the chances of Britain voting next week to leave the European Union grew, pushing investors towards the security of Japan and other traditional safe havens. 
As opinion polls continued to show the ""Leave"" camp moving ahead before the June 23 vote, and Britain's biggest selling paper, the Sun, came out in favour of leaving the bloc, sterling fell 1 percent to a two-month low of $1.4112.  
While many market players are sceptical about the accuracy of the polls, recent results have sent a shockwave through global financial markets.
The Swiss franc, another traditional harbour in times of global financial stress, hit a three-month high against the euro (EURCHF=), and the dollar gained about half a percent against the euro and a basket of currencies. (DXY) 
Ahead of this week's Bank of Japan meeting, traders say strong resistance around 105.50 has kept the yen from surging towards 100 per dollar - levels which many assume would force the Bank of Japan to intervene against its currency.
The debate now among traders is whether the BoJ will take policy steps on Thursday aimed at weakening the currency, when a vote for a Brexit next week would be expected to drive more buying of the yen globally as a safe haven for capital. 
""A lot of people say that the BOJ won't do anything this week given the context,"" currency fund Millennium's co-head of portfolio management, Richard Benson, said.
""But if the yen is at trade-weighted highs, I wouldn't be surprised (to see action). If they are looking for a chance to manipulate the currency weaker, a policy meeting would be a natural choice.""
There is also growing talk among market participants of the role the Bank of England and other central banks may play on the night of the Brexit vote. 
Senior currency industry managers say they have told the bank it should be prepared to intervene to help stabilise sterling for the first time in decades and the IMF has also told the bank to ensure it has swap lines open to other major central banks to provide foreign exchange if need be. 
Bookmakers' odds on a ""Remain"" vote have fallen from 78 percent last week to just 55 percent on Tuesday and William Hill said a Brexit could be odds-on favourite by the weekend. [FXBUZ]
The danger now is that makes the risks balanced and a sharp move in sterling on the night of the vote all but guaranteed, where previously traders had assumed only a vote to leave would generate a shock. 
While sterling fell against the dollar in morning trade in London, it recovered to trade steadily on the day against the euro at 79.19 pence. (EURGBP=D4) [GBP/]
""Our best guess of a post-Brexit reaction is still that sterling loses 5-10 percent quickly against the dollar, dragging other European currencies down too,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analysts said in a note. 

""What's changing this week is that the very near-term outlook around the vote is now more symmetrical. Sterling is now as likely to rally by 10 figures in the immediate aftermath of the vote as to fall by 10.""
