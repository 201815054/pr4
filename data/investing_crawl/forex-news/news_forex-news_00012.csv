In U.S. trading on Wednesday, GBP/USD was trading at 1.6715, down 0.57%, up from a session low of 1.6698 and off a high of 1.6816.
Cable was likely to find support at 1.6662, the low from April 15, and resistance at 1.6882, Tuesday's high.
The pound came under pressure after the Confederation of British Industry said its index of U.K. retailers dropped to 16.0 this month from 30.0 in April, defying expectations for a rise to 35.
The data came one day after a report by the British Bankers' Association showed that banks approved the lowest number of mortgages since August last month.
The data indicated that the U.K. housing market could be losing some momentum, although house prices remained strong.
The dollar, meanwhile, saw residual support stemming from Tuesday's upbeat U.S. consumer confidence, housing and wholesale pricing data, which served as a reminder that the economy continues to recover and is in less need of monetary stimulus measures.
The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index rose to 83.0 this month from 81.7 in April, in line with market expectations.
Elsewhere, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller house price index rose 12.4% in March from a year earlier, beating forecasts for a gain of 11.8% and following a rise of 12.9% in February.
Healthy wholesale pricing data firmed the greenback as well.
The Commerce Department reported earlier U.S. durable goods orders rose 0.8% in April, confounding expectations for a 0.5% fall, after a 3.6% increase in March, whose figure was revised up from a previously estimated 2.9% rise.
Core durable goods orders, which are stripped of volatile transportation items, rose 0.1% last month, missing expectations for a 0.3% increase. Core durable goods orders in March were revised up to a 2.9% gain from a previously estimated 2.4% rise.
Elsewhere, sterling was down against the euro, with EUR/GBP up 0.28% at 0.8135, and down against the yen, with GBP/JPY down 0.78% at 170.09.
On Thursday, the U.S. is to release revised data on first-quarter GDP as well as the weekly government report on initial jobless claims and data on pending home sales.

The pound fell to six-week lows, with GBP/USD dropping 0.61% to 1.6707. 
The drop in the pound came after recent lackluster U.K. private sector data on retail sales and mortgage lending tempered expectations for a rate hike by the Bank of England later this year.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars were sharply lower, with AUD/USD down 0.46% to 0.9215 and NZD/USD dropping 0.98% to 0.8479. Elsewhere, USD/CAD was almost unchanged at 1.0861.

The pair is likely to find support at 1.0850 and resistance at 1.0929, Thursday’s high.

The German Ifo business climate index declined to 110.4 in May; the lowest reading this year, from 111.2 in April, indicating that economic activity could slow in coming months.
Recent comments by senior ECB officials have signaled that the bank is open to acting as soon as June to stop inflation in the currency bloc from falling too low.

""The HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI rebounded sharply to 49.7 in May, up from 48.1 in April,"" said HSBC chief China economist Qu Hongbin.
""The improvement was broad-based with both new orders and new export orders back in expansionary territory. Disinflationary pressures also eased over the month and output prices increased for the first time since November 2013. However, the employment index fell further to 47.3, which implies that this month's uptick in sentiment has not yet filtered through to the labour market. Some tentative signs of stabilization are emerging, partly as a result of the recent mini-stimulus measures and lower borrowing costs. But downside risks to growth remain, particularly as the property market continues to cool. We think more policy easing is needed to put a floor under growth in the coming months.""

GBP/USD was trading at 1.6820, up fractionally from 1.6812 late Friday.
Cable was likely to find support at 1.6750 and resistance at 1.6873, the high of May 14.
Sterling’s strong performance this year has been boosted by talk of a merger between U.K. drug company Astrazeneca (LONDON:AZN) and one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE).
The merger looked likely to fail after AstraZeneca said Monday that it had rejected a final offer from Pfizer, saying the increased bid failed to recognize its full value.
Demand for the pound continued to be underpinned by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates ahead of other central banks as the recovery in the U.K. continues to deepen.
Investors remained cautious as they looked to the minutes from the Fed’s latest monetary policy meeting, due for release on Wednesday, for insight on the central bank's view of the economy.
Data on Friday showed that U.S. housing starts recorded the largest increase in five months in April, indicating that the economy is shaking off the effect of a weather related slowdown over the winter.
However, the upbeat housing data was overshadowed by a report showing that consumer confidence in the U.S. deteriorated this month.
Elsewhere Monday, the euro edged higher against the pound. EUR/GBP eased 0.11% to 0.8155, but was still close to last week’s 16-month trough of 0.8125.
The euro’s gains looked likely to remain limited amid growing expectations for fresh monetary easing by the European Central Bank at its next meeting in June, to safeguard the recovery in the euro zone and stop inflation from falling too low.

The upbeat housing data came one day after a report from the U.S. Department of Labor showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week fell to a six-year low of 297,000.
The robust data underlined the view that the U.S. economy was regaining traction after being slowed by unusually cold temperatures during the winter months.

The report came after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Chairman Graeme Wheeler said last week that the speed and extent of further interest rate increases will depend on economic performance and how much the nation’s strong currency weighs on inflation.
The central bank has already raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year to 3%, after keeping at a record low 2.5% to support the economy.

179,By Investing.com,"<span>May 18, 2014 05:56AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY weekly outlook: May 19 - 23,"Investing.com - The dollar edged lower against the yen late Friday after U.S. data on housing starts and consumer sentiment painted an uneven picture of the economic recovery.
USD/JPY settled at 101.52, down 0.05% for the day, not far from the two-month trough of 101.30 reached in the previous session. For the week, the pair was down 0.66%.
The dollar briefly edged up to session highs against the yen after the Commerce Department reported that U.S. housing starts rose 13.2% last month, after a 2.0% increase in March.
It was the largest increase in five months, indicating that the economy is shaking off the effect of a weather related slowdown over the winter.
The upbeat housing data was offset by a report showing that U.S. consumer confidence deteriorated this month. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 81.8, from 84.1 the month before. Analysts had expected a slight uptick to 84.5.
Elsewhere Friday, EUR/JPY settled at 139.03, down 0.17% for the day, after falling to lows of 138.78 earlier in the session, the weakest since February 12.
The single currency remained under pressure after weaker-than-expected data on euro zone first quarter growth on Thursday added to pressure on the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy at its next meeting in June, in order to safeguard the recovery in the region.
The euro zone’s gross domestic product grew just 0.2% in the first quarter, compared to expectations for growth of 0.4% and expanded by a smaller than expected 0.9% from a year earlier.
In the week ahead, investors will be looking to the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, due for release on Wednesday, for insight on the central bank's view of the economy.
The Bank of Japan’s monetary policy decision on Wednesday will also be in focus.

According to various reports the members resigned because they were unhappy with Brock Pierce, a controversial actor and former Disney child star that the foundation appointed as a director.

According to a Reuters report some of the people who resigned expressed concern with Pierce's past history, which the new organization said included allegations in past lawsuits that he provided drugs and alcohol to minors and pressured them for sex.
However the report also quoted Pierce's response to those allegations by telling Reuters in an email, ""The allegations against me are not true, and I have never had intimate or sexual contact with any of the people who made those allegations."" 
One of the members who resigned, Patrick Alexander, posted a comment on a discussion page for Bitcoin Foundation.
""""This is not the direction this foundation needs to take. The foundation members need to emulate very high moral values and ethics in business and in personal dealings, especially as it involves money. So far, the track record of prominent Bitcoin Foundation members has been abysmal. I know that most foundation members are probably swell people and are not like this. However, the acts of a few, have overshadowed us all unfortunately. I no longer want to be associated with these people,"" Alexander wrote.

Overnight, the dollar traded largely lower against most major currencies after markets digested positive data on the surface and found numbers to suggest headwinds are still slowing U.S. recovery.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its manufacturing index ticked down to 15.4 this month from 16.6 in April, better than expectations for a 14.0 reading.
The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending May 10 fell by 24,000 to 297,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 321,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 1,000 to 320,000 last week.

194,By International Business Times,"<span>May 15, 2014 03:45PM ET</span>",Bitcoin Integration With PayPal Being 'Actively Considered' Says eBay CEO,"By IBTimes Staff Reporter - John Donahoe, CEO of ecommerce giant eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), said he is actively considering an integration of popular digital currency Bitcoin (BTC-eUSD) with the company's payment processing service PayPal.
In a Q&A session at the company's annual shareholder meeting on 13 May, Donahoe said bitcoin is ""a new, exciting and emerging technology"" with lot of potential.

""We think bitcoin will play a very important role in the future. Exactly how that plays out, and how we can best take advantage of it and enable it with PayPal, that's something we're actively considering. It's on our radar screen.""
This is not the first time Donahoe has spoken about his positive view of bitcoin.
In an interview with Bloomberg in February, he said that multiple digital currencies can be integrated into PayPal and are not posing a threat to his business.
Nothing holding us back
""There is nothing holding PayPal back from pursuing digital payments today, as part of eBay. In fact PayPal is pursuing digital payments and is the leading digital payments alternative in many different environments,"" Donahoe said.
""You can use digital currencies in the PayPal digital wallet, that's in fact what PayPal is doing – is building a digital wallet that can take multiple types of currency.""
Last month eBay launched a virtual currency section of its US website, allowing users buy andsell digital currencies, as well as mining contracts and mining equipment.
In the UK, bitcoin owners would be able to list on the site's classifieds section, allowing the buying and selling of the cryptocurrency. Deals in classified ad formats mean actual transactions of bitcoins would take place outside of eBay.
EBay is still not accepting bitcoin or other digital currencies for payments. Its payment processing unit PayPal is facing stiff competition from bitcoin.
In a filing with the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), eBay earlier regarded bitcoin as a ""potential competitor"" to PayPal.
While PayPal charges a 2-3% fee for processing transactions, payments using bitcoin could be done with negligible fees, as they can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3689, Tuesday's low, and resistance at 1.3994, last Thursday's high.
Markets are prepared for the European Central Bank to either cut rates, implement fresh stimulus measures or a combo of both next month.
Reuters reported earlier that the ECB is preparing a “package of measures” including cuts to all interest rates, with negative rates on bank deposits to encourage lending to small and medium-sized businesses to spur recovery.
A day earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported the German central bank Bundesbank would back monetary easing measures, including a negative rate on bank deposits and purchases of packaged bank loans, if such tools were needed to keep persistently low levels of inflation from becoming entrenched in the euro zone.
Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi said monetary authorities were “comfortable” with acting at its next meeting in June.
By afternoon trading on Wednesday, the euro rebounded on demand from bottom fishers, as easing measures aren't a surprise after months of soft inflation rates and other euro zone data.
Elsewhere, industrial production in the euro zone fell in line with expectations in March, though the soft numbers underlined concerns over the outlook for economic growth in the single currency bloc, official data showed on Wednesday.
In a report, Eurostat, the European statistics agency, said industrial production declined by 0.3% in March, in line with forecasts. Industrial production in February rose 0.2%.
Year-on-year, industrial production fell 0.1% in March, disappointing expectations for a 1.0% gain and after rising at a rate of 1.7% in the preceding month.
Meanwhile in the U.S., producer price inflation rose more than expected in April, while core wholesale prices also topped forecasts, official data showed on Wednesday.
The Commerce Department reported earlier that producer prices increased by 0.6% last month, beating forecasts for a 0.2% gain, after rising 0.5% in March.
Year-over-year, the producer price index rose 2.1% in April, beating expectations for a 1.7% increase and up from 1.4% in the preceding month.
The core producer price index advanced 0.5% last month, compared to expectations for a 0.2% increase, after rising 0.6% in March.
Core produces prices rose at an annualized rate of 1.9% in April, beating forecasts for a 1.4% gain and after climbing 1.4% in the preceding month.
The Federal Reserve views core prices as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.
The euro was up against the pound, with EUR/GBP up 0.33% to 0.8171, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.40% at 139.57.
On Thursday, the euro zone is to publish preliminary data on first quarter GDP, as well as revised data on consumer inflation.
The U.S. is to release data on initial jobless claims, consumer inflation and industrial production, as well as a report on manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region.

The euro came under pressure following reports the European Central Bank is preparing to cut rates at its next meeting in June.
Reuters reported that the ECB is preparing a “package of measures” including cuts to all interest rates, with negative rates on bank deposits and measures to bolster lending to small and medium size businesses.

GBP/USD was down 0.32% to 1.6773, after the Bank of England left its forecasts for growth and inflation largely unchanged and played down speculation over the timing of a possible rate hike.
The BoE said in its quarterly inflation report that it now expects economic growth of 2.9% in 2015, up from 2.7% in its February report, and said the rate of growth this year would remain unchanged at 3.4%.
The bank said it expects annual inflation to be close to its 2% target over the next two to three years if interest rates in the U.K. rise in line with expectations in financial markets.
In addition, official data showed that the U.K. unemployment rate ticked down to a more than five-year low of 6.8% in the three months to March from 6.9% in the three months to February, in line with expectations.
The claimant count fell by 25,100 last month, the ONS said, compared to expectations for a decline of 30,000 people. March’s figure was revised to a drop of 30,600 people from a previously reported decline of 30,400.
The report said that average weekly earnings rose by 1.7% on a year-over-year basis in the three months to March, but excluding bonuses average earnings only rose by 1.3% during the quarter, and just 1.0% in March.
Elsewhere, the dollar declined lower against the yen, with USD/JPY sliding 0.45% to 101.81, while USD/CHF dipped 0.03% to 0.8899.

NZD/USD hit 0.8603 on Friday, the pair’s lowest since May 2, before subsequently consolidating at 0.8612 by close of trade, down 0.4% for the day and 0.6% lower for the week.
The pair is likely to find support at 0.8591, the low from May 2 and resistance at 0.8670, the high from May 8.
RBNZ Deputy Governor Spencer said Friday that the high exchange rate is a cause for concern. He added that housing market prices and the exchange rate are important variables for the pace and timing of interest rate hikes.
""A big uncertainty is the future path of the exchange rate, which has a major bearing on traded goods prices and overall economic activity,"" he said. ""The more downward pressure that the exchange rate exerts on prices and activity, the less pressure will need to be exerted by interest rates.""
The RBNZ has raised the official cash rate by 25 basis points twice since March to 3.00% now.
On Wednesday, RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler warned against the Kiwi's current strength, saying that ""it would become more opportune for the Reserve Bank to intervene in the currency market to sell New Zealand dollars"", in the face of worsening fundamentals.
In addition, official data showed that the number of employed people in New Zealand rose by 0.9% in the first quarter, beating expectations for a 0.6% increase, after a 1.1% gain in the three months to December.
The report also showed that New Zealand's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.0% in the last quarter, disappointing expectations for a downtick to 5.9%.
Meanwhile, the greenback remained under pressure after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday that a high degree of monetary accommodation remains warranted given the slack in the economy.
Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed that speculators increased their bullish bets on the New Zealand dollar in the week ending May 6.
Net longs totaled 20,693 contracts as of last week, compared to net longs of 18,480 contracts in the previous week.

AUD/USD hit 0.9393 on Thursday, the pair’s highest since April 15, before subsequently consolidating at 0.9363 by close of trade on Friday, down 0.12% for the day but 0.91% higher for the week.

In its statement of monetary policy published Friday, the RBA changed its growth and inflation forecasts despite a higher exchange rate, and said monetary policy will remain accommodative for an extended period.
The inflation outlook suggests there is still space capacity in the economy and ""given that assessment, the board's view is that the current accommodative monetary policy setting is likely to be appropriate for some time yet,"" the RBA said.
The central bank upgraded the outlook for the near term, forecasting annualized growth of 3.0% in June, compared with 2.75% in the February statement.
But in the case of inflation, the RBA lowered its near-term projection to a 2.75% gain year-on-year for underlying inflation from 3.00% in the February statement.

The pair was likely to find support at 1.0813 and resistance at 1.0960.
The Canadian dollar weakened after Statistics Canada reported that the economy shed 28,900 jobs in April, confounding expectations for jobs growth of 12,000.
The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.9%, in line with expectations but the labor force participation rate, which measures those still actively looking for work, ticked down to 66.1% in April from 66.2% the previous month.
The decline in employment was the largest since December 2013.
The weak data added to concerns over the prospect of weaker-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter and underlined expectations that the Bank of Canada will keep rates on hold for longer.

The SNB imposed the exchange rate floor in September 2011 to help stave off the risk of deflation and recession, as safe haven inflows prompted by the crisis in the euro zone pushed the Swiss franc close to parity with the euro.

267,By International Business Times,"<span>May 10, 2014 11:15AM ET</span>",Euro Suffers Greatest Dip In Weeks,"By Sneha Shankar - The euro fell the most in the past seven weeks against the dollar, after the European Central Bank, or ECB, signaled that it would ease monetary policy in June.
The euro weakened 0.7 percent to $1.374 while the local currency also fell from almost a 2.5-year high of just below $1.40 as Mario Draghi, ECB president, said that policymakers would be “comfortable” with further taking steps to support the euro-zone economy. Such a signal has made rival currencies more attractive.
“The ECB must take action for this to be a more sustained move lower [for euro-dollar],"" Ian Gordon, FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said, according to the Wall Street Journal, and added: ""Otherwise the market will keep testing the ECB's willingness and resolve to deal with the low inflationary pressure.""
German exports also fell 1.8 percent in the month, while imports declined 0.9% from February, Federal Statistics Office data showed, according to the Journal. The British pound fell 0.5 percent against the dollar, to $1.684.
“This is the last time that Draghi can maintain credibility with verbal intervention, and so it’s really time for them to deliver,” Mark McCormick, a macro strategist at Credit Agricole, said, according to Bloomberg, and added: “What’s been interesting, at least in the dollar framework, is U.S. rates have decoupled from economic data.”
The U.S. Labor Department reported that 288,000 jobs were created in April, making it the biggest increase since January 2012, while unemployment dropped to 6.3 percent, the lowest level since September 2008, Bloomberg reported.

“I have some sympathy for the view that the Fed is making a mistake about how much slack there is in the labor market,” Steven Englander, managing director and global head of Group of 10 FX Strategy at Citigroup in New York, said, according to Bloomberg, and added: “But you have to admit that the Fed seems utterly convinced that that slack is there, so until you find something that that refutes their view, I don’t think investors are going to be fighting that fight.”

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.66% at 1.3748.
The European Central Bank this week left interest rates unchanged at 0.25%, though the euro dropped after ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank's governing council would be comfortable acting at its next meeting after the bank publishes fresh inflation and growth forecasts.
Draghi attributed weak inflation rates to food and energy prices, but added that the strong euro and weak domestic demand are also pushing down inflation.
He reiterated that the ECB does not have a target for the euro exchange rate but stressed that the bank would closely monitor exchange-rate developments.
Market talk that fresh easing measures or rate cuts softened the euro, which boosted the dollar's safe-haven appeal.
The ECB will meet on June 5 to discuss monetary policy.
Elsewhere on Friday, official data revealed that Germany's trade surplus narrowed to €14.8 billion in March from €15.8 billion in February, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated surplus of €15.7 billion. Analysts had expected the trade surplus to widen to €16.6 billion in March.
Meanwhile, pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine ignored a public call by Russian President Vladimir Putin to postpone a referendum on self-rule and said they plan to go ahead on Sunday with a vote that some fear could lead to a civil war.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said earlier that the European Union was still struggling to agree on what approach to take on the crisis and added the event was the biggest threat to European security since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.12% at 101.78 and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.79% at 0.8872.

356,By Investing.com,"<span>May 04, 2014 05:12AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly outlook: May 5 - 9,"Investing.com - The dollar gave up gains against most of the other major currencies on Friday after a report showing that the U.S. economy added jobs at the fastest pace in more than two years in April also showed weaker earnings growth and a drop in labor force participation.
The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 288,000 jobs in April, well above expectations for jobs growth of 210,000. The U.S. unemployment rate dropped to a five and a half year low of 6.3%, compared to expectations for 6.6%.
The report also showed that the labor force participation rate, which measures the proportion of people either working or looking for work, fell to 62.8% from 63.2% in March. Meanwhile, average wage growth edged down in April from the same month last year, dampening the medium term inflation outlook.
Earlier in the week, preliminary data showed that U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 0.1% in the first three months of the year, well below forecasts for an expansion of 1.2%.
Despite the sharp slowdown in growth the Federal Reserve said Wednesday it would reduce its bond purchases to $45 billion a month. The Fed also said interest rates would remain on hold at record lows for a ""considerable time"" after the bond-buying program ends later this year.
The U.S. central bank acknowledged that first quarter growth was far weaker than expected, but added that growth had started to pick up in recent weeks.
The dollar initially moved broadly higher after the jobs report, with USD/JPY rising to 103.01, the strongest since April 8. The pair subsequently retraced these gains, ending the session at 102.18. The pair ended the week 0.33% lower.
EUR/USD fell to lows of 1.3812 before recovering to trade at 1.3869 by the close of Friday’s session.
Concerns that the euro zone is falling into deflation persisted after data on Wednesday showed that the annual rate of inflation ticked up to 0.7% in April, from a record low 0.5% the previous month, but still remained well below the European Central Bank’s target of close to but just below 2%.
The slight uptick in consumer prices did ease pressure on the ECB to implement further monetary easing measures to tackle low inflation in the region.
GBP/USD ended the session slightly lower at 1.6874, after falling as low as 1.6824 earlier in choppy trade. The pair neared five year highs in the previous session after upbeat U.K. manufacturing data added to expectations for a rate hike by the Bank of England in the early part of next year.
In the week ahead, market participants will be focusing on Thursday’s ECB monetary policy announcement. Rate reviews by BoE and the Reserve Bank of Australia will also be closely watched.

In U.S. trading, USD/JPY was down 0.49% and trading at 102.14, up from a session low of 102.04 and off a high of 102.66.
The pair was expected to test support at 101.96, Friday's low, and resistance at 102.78, Tuesday's high.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported earlier that U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.1% in the first quarter, far shy of expectations for a 1.2% growth rate. The U.S. economy expanded by 2.6% in the previous quarter.
The numbers softened the dollar by clouding the fate of U.S. monetary policy.
The Federal Reserve was due to release its latest statement on monetary policy later in the day, and many investors avoided the greenback until the monetary authority announces its decision on interest rates and its monthly bond-buying program.
While the headline growth rate was weak, many investors blamed rough winter weather, pointing out poor exports and investments affected by blizzards.
The data also revealed that consumer spending on services rose to its highest level in 14 years.
Overall consumer spending rose 3.0%, while spending on services rose by 4.4%, though still, concerns that the U.S. economy faces headwinds, weather-related or not, sent investors ditching the dollar on concerns that even as the Fed winds down its monthly bond-purchasing program, interest rates will remain low for some time to come.
Fed bond purchases, currently set at $55 billion a month, weaken the dollar by suppressing long-term borrowing costs, which sends investors to assets like stocks in hope companies take advantage of rising equities indices and invest and hire.
Separately, payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose by 220,000 this month, above expectations for an increase of 210,000. March’s figure was revised up to a gain of 209,000 from a previously reported increase of 191,000.
Data also showed that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index rose to 63.0 this month from a reading of 55.9 in March. Analysts had expected the index to improve to 56.7 in April.
Meanwhile in Japan, the Bank of Japan stuck to its pledge to target an annual increase in the monetary base of between ¥60 trillion and ¥70 trillion, as expected, though the pair focused on U.S. data primarily.
The yen, meanwhile, was up against the euro and up against the pound, with EUR/JPY down 0.10% at 141.63, and GBP/JPY trading down 0.22% at 172.36.
In the euro zone, data showed that the annual inflation rate ticked up to 0.7% in April, after falling to a record low 0.5% in March, missing market calls for a 0.8% reading. The European Central Bank targets an inflation rate of close to but just under 2%.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs rose 1% in April, accelerating from 0.7% in March and in line with expectations.
The uptick in inflation was seen as strong enough to ease pressure on the ECB to take steps to tackle low inflation in the euro zone. Earlier this month the central bank warned that it could launch a ""broad-based"" asset purchase program if the medium-term inflation outlook deteriorated.
On Thursday, the U.S. is to publish the weekly report on initial jobless claims. At the same time, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is to speak at an event in Washington; her comments will be closely watched.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported earlier that U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.1% in the first quarter, far shy of expectations for a 1.2% growth rate. The U.S. economy expanded by 2.6% in the previous quarter.
The numbers softened the dollar by clouding the fate of U.S. monetary policy.
The Federal Reserve was due to release its latest statement on monetary policy later in the day, and many investors avoided the greenback until the monetary authority announces its decision on interest rates and its monthly bond-buying program.
While the headline growth rate was weak, many investors blamed rough winter weather, pointing out poor exports and investments affected by blizzards.
The data also revealed that consumer spending on services rose to its highest level in 14 years.
Overall consumer spending rose 3.0%, while spending on services rose by 4.4%, though still, concerns that the U.S. economy faces headwinds, weather-related or not, sent investors ditching the dollar on concerns that even as the Fed winds down its monthly bond-purchasing program, interest rates will remain low for some time to come.
Fed bond purchases, currently set at $55 billion a month, weaken the dollar by suppressing long-term borrowing costs, which sends investors to assets like stocks in hope companies take advantage of rising equities indices and invest and hire.
Separately, payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose by 220,000 this month, above expectations for an increase of 210,000. March’s figure was revised up to a gain of 209,000 from a previously reported increase of 191,000.
Data also showed that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index rose to 63.0 this month from a reading of 55.9 in March. Analysts had expected the index to improve to 56.7 in April.
Meanwhile in the euro zone, data showed that the annual inflation rate ticked up to 0.7% in April, after falling to a record low 0.5% in March, missing market calls for a 0.8% reading. The European Central Bank targets an inflation rate of close to but just under 2%.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs rose 1% in April, accelerating from 0.7% in March and in line with expectations.
The uptick in inflation was seen as easing pressure on the ECB to take steps to tackle low inflation in the euro zone. Earlier this month the central bank warned that it could launch a ""broad-based"" asset purchase program if the medium-term inflation outlook deteriorated.
The euro was up against the pound, with EUR/GBP up 0.06% to 0.8213, and down against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.11% at 141.61.
On Thursday, markets in the euro zone will be closed for the Labor Day holiday.
The U.S. is to publish the weekly report on initial jobless claims. At the same time, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is to speak at an event in Washington; her comments will be closely watched.
Later Thursday, the Institute of Supply Management is to release a report on manufacturing activity.

“However, their expectations regarding the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market held steady. Thus, while sentiment regarding current conditions may have slipped a bit, consumers do not foresee the economy, or the labor market, losing the momentum that has been building up over the past several months.”
The dollar largely ignored the data as the report was not seen as weak enough to indicate the economy was softening to the point that the Federal Reserve will slow up the pace at which it tapers its monthly bond-buying program.

The Present Situation Index decreased to 78.3 from 82.5, while the Expectations Index was virtually unchanged at 84.9 versus 84.8 in March.
“Consumer confidence declined slightly in April, as consumers assessed current business and labor market conditions less favorably than in March,” Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement.
“However, their expectations regarding the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market held steady. Thus, while sentiment regarding current conditions may have slipped a bit, consumers do not foresee the economy, or the labor market, losing the momentum that has been building up over the past several months.”
The dollar largely ignored the data as the report was not seen as weak enough to indicate the economy was softening to the point that the Federal Reserve will slow up the pace at which it tapers its monthly bond-buying program.
Fed bond purchases, currently set at $55 billion a month, weaken the dollar by suppressing long-term borrowing costs, and expectations for further Fed tapering tends to strengthen the greenback.

416,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 29, 2014 01:45AM ET</span>",Bitcoin Traders Settle Class Actions,"By Reuters - (Reuters) - U.S. and Canadian customers of failed Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox have agreed to settle their proposed class action lawsuits that alleged the company defrauded them of hundreds of millions of dollars.
The class action plaintiffs agreed to support a plan by Sunlot Holdings to buy the shuttered exchange and accept their share of bitcoins still held by Mt. Gox, according to a statement and court filings.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan and the United States earlier this year after saying it lost some 850,000 bitcoins - worth more than $400 million - in a hacking attack. It subsequently said it found 200,000 bitcoins.
""BEST OPTION""
Once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox is slated to be liquidated after the Tokyo District Court granted the company's request to abandon plans to revive its business.
In return for settling separate class actions, the U.S. and Canadian customers will share in a 16.5 percent stake after Mt. Gox is sold to Sunlot, a firm backed by child actor-turned entrepreneur Brock Pierce and venture capitalist William Quigley.
In addition, the customers will split the 200,000 bitcoins that Mt. Gox said it found after seeking bankruptcy protection, and will also split up to $20 million in fiat currency held by the administrator for Mt. Gox.

""This is the customers' best option and the only chance they have for full restitution,"" said a statement from Jay Edelson of the Edelson law firm, the lead attorney in the U.S. case.
Sunlot has proposed buying Mt. Gox for one bitcoin, or less than $500, according to the Wall Street Journal. A sale to Sunlot must be approved by the Tokyo court.
The court-appointed administrator for Mt. Gox, attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, a national holiday in Japan.
The settlement releases Mt. Gox's founder, Jed McCaleb, and Gonzague Gay-Bouchery, once the exchange's chief marketing officer. The pair committed to help pursue the class action against the remaining defendants: Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, parent company Tibanne, the company's banking partner Mizuho Bank Ltd and others.
The settlement needs to be approved by the Canadian and U.S. courts overseeing the class actions cases.
The U.S. class action is Gregory Greene et al v Mt. Gox Inc et al; United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 14-01437
The Canadian class action is David Joyce et al v Mt. Gox Inc et al, Ontario Superior Court of Justice, CV-14-500253-00CP

The pair was likely to find support at 1.3785, the low of April 22 and resistance at 1.3853.
Speaking at a conference in Amsterdam, Draghi said the euro exchange rate is an ""increasingly important factor"" in monetary policy.
The exchange rate is not a policy target in itself, the ECB chief said, but the bank’s monetary policy stance could be affected by a continued appreciation in the currency.
""A rise in the exchange rate, all else being equal, implies a tightening of monetary conditions, a downward impact on inflation and potentially a threat to the ongoing recovery. If so, this would call for policy action to maintain the current accommodative stance,"" Draghi said.
He also said the ECB could launch a ""broad-based"" asset purchase program if the medium-term inflation outlook worsened.
Elsewhere in the euro zone, Spain saw borrowing costs decline to the lowest level on record at an auction of ten-year government bonds on Thursday, pointing to underlying confidence in the euro zone recovery.

Beijing has said the yuan is nearing fair-market value. Last month, PBOC Vice Governor Yi Gang said the bank’s ""decisive role in the exchange rate will weaken.""

The annual rate of euro zone inflation slowed to 0.5% in March, the lowest since November 2009.
Euro zone inflation has now been in the ECB’s danger zone of below 1% for six straight months, adding to pressure on policymakers to implement fresh stimulus measures to shore up the fragile recovery in the region.
On Tuesday, ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said the bank still had room to lower its key interest rates.
“We have several instruments in the event that it is necessary to loosen monetary policy. We still have room to cut the key interest rate,"" he said.
Coeure also said the strong euro ""risks slowing the return of inflation to a level close to and below 2%, which is our definition of price stability."" He said it was ""certain"" that appreciation of the euro since mid-2012 had contributed to the low level of current inflation.
The euro edged higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY inching up 0.09% to 141.67.

Kuroda said the outlook for consumer prices was up, with the year-on-year rate in core consumer prices expected to be around 1.25% for some time, not including a sales tax hike on April 1 to 8% from 5%.
Kuroda repeated the BOJ's mantra that it will continue with quantitative and qualitative easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2%, by 2015.
Overnight, the dollar traded largely higher against most major currencies, looking past dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen and rising on demand from investors ditching the yen due to strong Chinese data.
The Federal Reserve will keep benchmark interest rates low even as the economy improves to ensure sustained recovery, Yellen said earlier.
Monetary authorities hope to see the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 reaching 5.2-5.6% and inflation at 1.7-2%, Yellen said.
""If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability for the first time in nearly a decade. I find this baseline outlook quite plausible,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks in a speech she delivered at the Economic Club of New York.
In the meantime, markets should pay close attention to inflation and unemployment rates, as hiccups can serve as weather vanes when it comes to monetary policy and how long interest rates remain low.
""The larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from their respective objectives, and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives, the longer the current target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained,"" Yellen said.

541,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 16, 2014 08:00AM ET</span>",US Treasury Criticizes Yuan's 'Unprecedented' Movement,"By Sneha Shankar - The U.S. government Tuesday criticized China for the recent depreciation in the yuan, calling the movement unprecedented, but stopped short of accusing Beijing of manipulating the currency, even as China’s Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, growth reduced to its slowest pace in 18 months in the first quarter of 2014.
The U.S. Treasury said the weakening yuan would “raise particularly serious concerns"" if the currency's most recent fall signaled a change in Beijing's policy to allow the yuan to appreciate based on market forces. Last month, China had doubled the range within which the yuan can move against the U.S. dollar but the yuan has seen a downward trend due to external pressures including lower consumer spending and industrial production, which indicate a slowing Chinese economy. 
""The Chinese authorities have been unwilling to allow an appreciation large enough to bring the currency to market equilibrium, opting instead for a gradual adjustment which has now been partially reversed,"" the Treasury Department said, adding: ""China should disclose foreign-exchange market intervention regularly to increase the credibility of its monetary policy framework and to promote exchange-rate and financial-market transparency.""
The latest criticism follows the U.S. Treasury's comments, six months back, about Germany's economic policies, which the U.S. said was creating problems for its neighbors in the euro zone and for the global economy. A report from MarketWatch noted that China has not been called a currency manipulator since 1994 for fear of worsening trade relations. The yuan weakened by 2.6 percent against the dollar between mid-February and mid-March.
Meanwhile, preliminary data Wednesday calculated by the National Bureau of Statistics, or NBS, showed that China's GDP reached 12.8213 trillion yuan ($2.08 trillion) in the first quarter of 2014, indicating a 7.4 percent growth rate, down from 7.7 percent registered in the fourth quarter of 2013. The latest growth number was also slightly below the target rate of 7.5 percent set by the country’s leaders for 2014. Industrial production for March grew 8.8 percent, slightly below analysts' expectations of 9 percent, compared to 8.6 percent growth in January and February.

China has taken measures including increasing investments in the country's rail infrastructure, tax cuts, and a simplification of the administrative process, to help maintain the target growth rate.
""That sector is continuing to moderate and now there is an even bigger gap between industrial production and retail sales. So the rotation from relying on heavy industries towards consumption is certainly coming to fruition,"" Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific research at TDSecurities in Singapore said, according to Reuters, referring to retail sales, which grew at 12.2 percent."

In China, consumer prices rose 2.4% year-on-year, a tad below the 2.5% gain expected, while producer prices fell 2.3%, in line with expectations and marking the 25th straight month of declines and underscore overcapacity problems in China.
Minutes from the March meeting of the Bank of Japan board showed members shared the view that the effects of the aggressive easy policy launched in April 2013 are steadily working, according to text released on Friday.
The nine board members ""expressed the view that it was appropriate for the BOJ to continue to steadily pursue quantitative and qualitative monetary easing in accordance with the current guidelines, as Japan's economic and priced evelopments had been broadly in line with the forecasts presented in October 2013,"" the minutes showed.
The March meeting minutes indicated that the policymakers don't see an imminent need for additional easy policy, although market players are betting on additional monetary easing in the coming month.
There was agreement that that real interest rates are falling on the back of a rise in inflation expectations, the minutes also showed.
But one member questioned the expectations for the policy
""If a rise were to occur in markets' anticipation that quantitative and qualitative easing would continue for a protracted period or extreme additional measures would be implemented in a situation where it was unlikely that the price stability target would be achieved in about two years, this could lead to economic instability in the medium to long term, such as through a buildup of financial imbalances,"" they showed.

670,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 04, 2014 03:20PM ET</span>",Dollar mixed to lower on uninspiring March jobs report,"Investing.com - A lukewarm March jobs report weakened the dollar on Friday by clouding expectations as to how long the Federal Reserve will keep monetary stimulus programs in place.
In U.S. trading on Thursday, EUR/USD was down 0.12% at 1.3704.
In the U.S. earlier, the Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 192,000 jobs in March, missing expectations for a 200,000 increase. February's figure was revised up to 197,000 from 175,000, while January's figure rose to 144,000 from 129,000.
The private sector added 192,000 jobs last month, below expectations for a 195,000 rise, while February's figure was revised up to 188,000 jobs added from a previously estimated 162,000 increase.
The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.7% last month compared to expectations for a 6.6% reading.
The numbers sent investors rethinking when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates once it winds down monthly asset purchases.
While lackluster, the numbers were not disappointing enough to sway investors' focus from the European Central Bank.
On Thursday, the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record-low 0.25%, held its marginal lending rate at 0.75% and left its deposit facility rate unchanged at zero.
ECB President Mario Draghi said monetary authorities did not exclude further monetary policy easing and reiterated the ECB's forward guidance that interest rates will remain at their current levels, or lower, for an extended period.
He added the ECB's governing council was ""unanimous"" in its commitment to using all unconventional instruments within its mandate to ward off deflationary pressures and added that the bank discussed the possibility of negative deposit rates.
Elsewhere on Friday, official data revealed that German factory orders rose 0.6% in February, beating expectations for a 0.1% gain. Factory orders in January were revised down to a 0.1% increase from a previously estimated 1.2% rise.
The dollar was down against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.65% at 103.24, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.05% at 0.8916.

In Canada, official data showed that the economy added 42,900 jobs last month, exceeding expectations for a 21,500 rise, after a 7,000 decline in February.
Canada's unemployment rate declined to 6.9% in March, from 7% in February. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged last month.
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.06% at 80.56.
On Friday, the dollar will move on the government nonfarm payrolls report and unemployment rate.

In her first major speech as Fed Chair, Yellen told the National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference in Chicago, Illinois, that the U.S. economy still needs monetary support to ensure more sustained recovery.
""I believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to provide substantial help to the labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence I see that there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks of her speech.
The Fed is currently purchasing $55 billion in bonds a month to spur recovery, a monetary policy tool known as quantitative easing that suppresses interest rates to prop up the economy, weakening the dollar as a side effect.
Yellen's words sent investors reevaluating the pace at which the U.S. central bank will taper its bond-buying program let alone begin hiking benchmark interest rates.
""I think this extraordinary commitment is still needed and will be for some time, and I believe that view is widely shared by my fellow policymakers at the Fed,"" Yellen said
Elsewhere, data revealed that manufacturing activity in the Chicago region expanded at a slower rate than forecast in March, as new orders fell.
The Chicago purchasing managers’ index fell 55.9 from 59.8 in February. Analysts had expected the index to tick down to 59.0.
Meanwhile in Europe, the euro zone's consumer price index slowed to 0.5% this month from 0.7% in February, undershooting expectations for a reading of 0.6%. The European Central Bank targets an inflation rate of just under 2%, and March's figure was the lowest since November of 2009.
The report showed that core inflation rose 0.8% in March, in line with forecasts, but down from 1.0% in February.
While inflation rates missed consensus forecasts, expectations for the European Central Bank to loosen policy sooner or later have been priced into trading by many investors, which gave the single currency room to shrug off soft consumer inflation numbers.
Separate expectations that the ECB will still remain in a wait-and-see mode at a policy meeting on Thursday due to sentiments that prices are soft but not deflationary supported the euro as well.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.36% at 103.20, and down against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.34% at 0.8838.
The greenback was down against the pound, with GBP/USD up 0.21% at 1.6676.
In the U.K., the Bank of England reported earlier that U.K. mortgage approvals fell to 70,309 in February, the lowest level since October 2013. Market expectations had been for a slight decline to 75,000 from January’s more than six-year high of 76,753.
The BoE also said business lending was down ₤750 million compared with the previous month.
Net lending rose by ₤2.3 billion last month, in line with forecasts, up from ₤2.1 billion in January.
The dollar was down against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD down 0.05% at 1.1055, AUD/USD up 0.26% at 0.9272 and NZD/USD up 0.22% at 0.8675.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.12% at 80.25.
On Tuesday in the U.S., the Institute of Supply Management is to publish a report on U.S. manufacturing growth.

758,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 30, 2014 05:49AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly outlook: March 31 - April 4,"Investing.com - The dollar rose to two-week highs against the yen on Friday, as indications that China’s government is prepared to do more to shore up the cooling economy bolstered risk appetite.
Market sentiment was boosted after China's premier Li Keqiang said the country has policies in place to counter economic volatility. The remarks eased concerns over recent signs of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.
Data on Friday showing that U.S. consumer spending rose 0.3% last month after a downwardly revised gain of 0.2% in January also lifted the dollar higher against the yen.
USD/JPY rose 0.64% to end Friday’s session at 102.83, the highest since March 12. For the week, the pair gained 0.57%.
The euro edged up from one-month lows against the dollar following the comments, with EUR/USD inching up 0.07% to settle at 1.3752, recovering from lows of 1.3702. The pair ended the week down 0.61%.
The euro remained under pressure after European Central Bank officials indicated earlier in the week that they are considering fresh policy options to stave off the risk of deflation in the region. ECB governing council member and Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann said Tuesday that a negative deposit rate could be an appropriate way to address the impact of strong gains in the euro.
The same day ECB President Mario Draghi that the central bank stood ready to act if inflation slipped lower than the ECB expected.
Data on Friday showing that the annual rate of inflation in Spain slipped 0.2% in March fuelled concerns that deflation could threaten the economic recovery in the euro area. A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in Germany slowed in March.
The dollar was lower against the pound on Friday, with GBP/USD up 0.185 to 1.6640 at the close of trade.
Sterling remained supported after a report on Friday showed that U.K. fourth quarter growth was left unrevised at 0.7% for the final three months of 2013. Another report showed that the U.K. current account deficit came in at a larger-than-expected 22.4 billion pounds in the fourth quarter.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar rose to a four-month high of 0.9295 against the greenback on Friday, before trimming back gains slightly to settle at 0.9247. AUD/USD ended the week with gains of 1.33%.
The Aussie was boosted as recent reports indicated that the economy is picking up, while hopes for fresh stimulus measures from China also supported the Australian’s dollar’s gains. Meanwhile, NZD/USD edged down 0.18% to 0.8654 at the close on Friday, after hitting two-and-a-half year highs of 0.8696 earlier in the session. The pair ended the week with gains of 1.31%.
In the week ahead, investors will be looking to Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for March for further indications on the strength of the labor market, while Monday’s euro zone inflation report will also be in focus, ahead of the ECB policy meeting and press conference on Thursday.

777,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 27, 2014 11:30AM ET</span>",Bitcoin's Bitter History In China,"By Sophie Song - The official demise of bitcoin in China has arrived. The People’s Bank of China is mandating banks to close by April 15 all accounts opened by operators of websites that trade, essentially forcing all bitcoin exchanges in China to shut down.
""The only one way out for bitcoin websites is moving their servers abroad and using the service of foreign banks and payment companies,"" according to an analyst who has been following the matter closely. Chinese investors would only be able to purchase bitcoins with cash under this new regulation, Caixin, a Chinese financial news portal, reported on Thursday.
Funds may be withdrawn from the accounts before the deadline but no deposits can be made, the document that the central bank sent to regional offices said. The document listed the 15 exchanges and said banks that fail to close the accounts will be punished.
Over the past year, China has been an epicenter for the bitcoin's soaring popularity as well as its volatility. Bitcoin first gained traction in China when state media firm CCTV televised a documentary on the currency in May 2013. By October, BTC China has become the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange by trading volume, and the value of a bitcoin shot over $1,000.
But by early December the Chinese government delivered its first blow against bitcoin when it banned financial institutions from trading it. That prompltly drove bitcoin's price down 20 percent.
Less than two weeks later BTC China was forced to stop accepting deposits in renminbi, the Chinese currency. Mere hours after the announcement, the value of the virtual currency tumbled to around $380. Just the day prior, the WInklevoss brothers, one-time Facebook claimants and early bitcoin investors, predicted that one bitcoin could be worth $40,000.

The currency recovered somewhat when pioneering bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy when it allegedly lost 6 percent of all bitcoins in circulation. Huobi.com, a Chinese exchange based in Beijing, transacted 110,992 bitcoins in the 24 hours after the Mt. Gox fall and became the biggest bitcoin trading platform in the world by volume.
Currently bitcoin is worth about $540.11, a far cry from its $1,000 peak price.
With the latest wholesale ban of bitcoin exchanges in China, even that price is likely to fall. "

797,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 26, 2014 08:00AM ET</span>",Why Americans Distrust Bitcoin,"By Kukil Bora - Despite widespread awareness about Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency, most Americans do not trust it, according to a new survey conducted online by Harris Interactive on behalf of Yodlee, a Redwood City, Calif.-based software company.
Although 48 percent of American adults said they understand what Bitcoin is, most of them do not trust it enough to invest in it, and while Bitcoin’s value has seen huge gains over the past year, Americans are still uncertain of its reliability and usefulness as a mainstream currency, the survey, conducted in December among 2,039 adults aged 18 and older, revealed.
“The financial industry benefits greatly from disruptive technology, but security is unfortunately a bigger challenge than some new financial innovators expect.” Tim O’Brien, Yodlee’s senior vice president of operations and information security, said in statement. “Bitcoin has addressed some major opportunities in the financial system, but the vulnerability of some Bitcoin exchanges, along with the currency’s overall volatility, are still serious issues.”
The survey, which showed that only 13 percent of respondents would choose Bitcoin as an investment over gold, also revealed that an increased awareness of Bitcoin corresponded to reduced trust in it.
Among the respondents, young adults tended to be the biggest Bitcoin supporters, with 20 percent of Americans aged between 18 and 34 who knew about Bitcoin, stating they would choose the currency over gold as an investment option, while only 8 percent of those aged above 55 preferred Bitcoin over gold.

Asked if government should regulate Bitcoin, 45 percent of Americans said they were unsure. Among respondents with a firm opinion, 44 percent said government should be allowed to regulate the digital currency, while 56 percent said no government should regulate the currency.
In addition, the survey also showed male respondents were more aware about Bitcoin than females, with only 35 percent of women across the country stating they know what Bitcoin is, compared to 63 percent of men claiming knowledge of the digital currency. However, this increased awareness did not translate into confidence about Bitcoin’s value, according to the survey, with only 14 percent of men and 10 percent of women stating they would prefer Bitcoin as an investment over gold.
Here are some additional findings from the survey:
- 61 percent of respondents with an annual household income of $100,000 or more have heard of Bitcoin, while only 20 percent of them said they would choose it as an investment over gold.
- The Northeast is America’s most pro-Bitcoin region. Fifty-one percent of adults in this region know what Bitcoin is while 19 percent of those Bitcoin-aware people said they would choose to invest in it over gold.
“Bitcoin will be hard for consumers to understand and trust on a large scale until secure, user-friendly tools and services emerge to make it as convenient and safe as possible to use,” O’Brien said."

812,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 25, 2014 07:45AM ET</span>",Did Venezuela Just Massively Devalue Its Currency? ,"By Reuters - (Reuters) - Venezuela launched a new free-floating foreign exchange system on Monday that offered dollars for eight times the official price in a move the government says will tame the black market but which critics see as a massive devaluation.
 The central bank said the price for dollars on the inaugural day of the Sicad 2 system was 51.8 bolivars. Private bank operators who took part said demand was high but offers thin.   The new platform added a third state-sanctioned exchange rate to the South American OPEC member's 11-year-old currency controls, with dollars selling at 6.3 bolivars for preferential goods and around 11 bolivars for other items.   On the black market, greenbacks currently fetch around 57-58 bolivars. That price has fallen from 85 bolivars a couple of weeks ago on expectations of greater dollar flows via Sicad 2.   Though overseen by the central bank, the new system works on a supply-and-demand system, with individuals and companies allowed to participate in daily trading.   ""Without doubt, it's the biggest monetary adjustment in Venezuela's history,"" said Henkel Garcia, of private think tank Econometrica, referring to the unexpectedly high price for dollars fetched on the first day of Sicad 2 trading.   President Nicolas Maduro denies that, saying the new market will account for only about 7-8 percent of dollar sales in Venezuela, with the 6.3 rate still applying for 80 percent of goods considered priority imports.   ""To see the impact of this devaluation, we will have to see its weight in imports and the payment of things such as private debt and repatriation of profits,"" Garcia added.  
Foreign companies have long complained of difficulties in getting profits out of Venezuela in hard currency. Sicad 2 gives them a clear legal alternative, reducing the temptation to turn to the illegal market.   Maduro's predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, set up currency controls in 2003 as part of a socialist-style overhaul of the economy that he said would channel more wealth to workers rather than to wealthy people with bank accounts abroad.   BONDS RISE   Critics say the controls spawned corruption, curtailed business and gave birth to the black market for dollars.   Wall Street economists and bondholders have welcomed the new system as a much-needed easing of controls, though they want Maduro to go further across the economy.   Most Venezuelan bond prices were up on Monday, with the benchmark sovereign global 2027 gaining 2.22 percent to a bid price of 76.750.   Sicad 2 trading takes place daily until 1 p.m. local time (1730 GMT), with the bank announcing the average price afterward.   The new system revives a previous one, known locally as the ""permuta"" or ""swap"" market, which Chavez shuttered in 2010 after accusing speculators of manipulating it.   Opposition politicians have long criticized the government's currency controls. Still, they are lambasting Maduro for what they call a ""stealth devaluation"" via the new system.   ""Today will be 'black Monday' ... This mega-devaluation is a harsh blow to all Venezuelans,"" opposition leader Henrique Capriles said on Twitter.   Venezuela's annual inflation rate, currently at more than 56 percent, is the highest in the Americas.   Analysts expect the price of Sicad 2 dollars to remain around the opening level in the short term, with the high rate likely to encourage initially reluctant private businesses to offer dollars alongside Venezuelan state institutions.   State oil company PDVSA is likely to be a big player.   ""I think it's positive they are allowing the market to sell, to clear that price rather than trying to massage it as much as they can in order to avoid the price signal that the economy is demanding,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Alberto Ramos.   ""I think it is a reasonable range, between 50 and 60... It is indeed a stealth devaluation as many of the transactions in the economy are going to close at this rate, not the official rate. This is a massive devaluation, there's no doubt about it.""   (Editing by Daniel Wallis, Dan Grebler and Eric Walsh)"

846,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 21, 2014 03:39PM ET</span>","Dollar falls on profit taking, though Fed rate hike concerns support","Investing.com - The dollar moved lower against most major currencies due to profit taking on Friday, though ongoing expectations for the Federal Reserve to continue signaling when interest rates may rise trimmed earlier losses.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.14% at 1.3797.
The U.S. currency shot up this week after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested at a Wednesday press conference that interest rates could rise six months after the Fed's bond-buying program ends, which is widely seen taking place this fall.
Fed asset purchases, currently set at $55 billion a month, aim to stimulate the economy by suppressing interest rates, weakening the dollar as long as they remain in effect, and Yellen's comments left many expecting benchmark interest rates to begin rising around the first half of 2015.
Profit-taking sent the dollar falling on Friday.
However, giving the greenback some support were comments made by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard,  who told reporters earlier that Yellen's six-month space between the end of bond purchases and tighter monetary policy matched private-sector expectations.
""On the 'considerable period' being six months, the surveys that I had seen from the private sector had that kind of number penciled in,'' St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said during a lunch with journalists, according to Reuters.
""That wasn't very different from what we had heard from financial markets. So, I just think she's just repeating that.''
Elsewhere on Friday, Fitch Ratings affirmed U.S. long-term foreign and local currency credit ratings at AAA with a stable outlook, taking the country off negative ratings watch.

Gox found 200,000 forgotten bitcoins, a week after the online currency exchange filed for bankruptcy claiming that all its bitcoins had been stolen, the company said in a statement Thursday.
Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox said that the bitcoins were found in an old electronic wallet that the company had previously believed was empty and was last used in June 2011. Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, stating that it had lost all of its 850,000 bitcoins, said that it moved the newly-found bitcoins into offline wallets due to “security reasons.” The discovery of the bitcoins was made known to the courts, lawyers and other authorities, the company said.

“Taking into account the existence of the 200,000 BTC (balance of bitcoins), the total number of bitcoins which have disappeared is therefore estimated to be approximately 650,000 BTC,” Mt. Gox said in the statement.
When the company filed for bankruptcy, it had said that, due to a technical issue, its customers were able to make fraudulent withdrawals on the exchange. While Mt. Gox claimed it had fallen victim to a technical problem due to which one of the largest exchanges of the digital currency had to declare bankruptcy, others had speculated about the possibility of fraud on the exchange’s part.
On Thursday, a U.S. judge in Chicago, supervising a lawsuit against Mt. Gox, revised a previous order and allowed some of the exchange's bitcoin movements to be tracked.
""Today in court we got relief ... specifically to track the 180,000 bitcoins, which we've been monitoring. Hours later, Mt. Gox claimed it ""found"" these bitcoins ... it appears Mt. Gox realized we were close and decided to acknowledge that it owned these 180,000-200,000 bitcoins,"" Steven L. Woodrow, a partner at law firm Edelson, told Reuters.
Jonathan Waller, an investor who develops bitcoin-related projects said, according to Financial Times: “It’s good they’ve found some of the Bitcoins but I think it was a badly run system which lost control of their Bitcoins.""
Earlier in March, the Japanese government had struggled to explain how the world’s largest bitcoin exchange lost about nearly a billion units of the digital currency. A London-based firm, Selachii LLP, also filed a lawsuit against Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, raising further doubts about the exchange's claims of a hack.
Last week, Karpeles’ Reddit account and his personal blog were breached and the hackers claimed that they found some discrepancies in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins that Mt. Gox claimed was stolen.
The hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox’s accounts while the exchange reported that 750,000 bitcoins belonging to its clients and 100,000 bitcoins of its own had been lost in the hack.

862,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 20, 2014 11:30AM ET</span>",Here's Why Some African Currencies Have Hit Record Lows ,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - Belt-tightening around the world, weaker commodity prices and careless domestic spending are all conspiring to weaken the currencies of sub-Saharan countries for an extended period analysts said this week.
Zambia’s kwacha tumbled to an all-time low this month after currencies in Ghana and Nigeria also suffered. But the worst isn’t over yet as these countries get hit by falling commodity prices and widening deficits.
“The gradual tightening of global monetary conditions, combined with growing domestic vulnerabilities in some countries, mean that currencies across the region are likely to come under further pressure over the coming months,” wrote Shilan Shah, Africa economics at Capital Economics, in a note on Wednesday.
The Zamibian currency has been steadily weakening along with global copper prices, which have fallen more than 10 percent in the past month, and 14 percent this year. Copper accounts for 60 percent of Zambian exports, and the country is one of the largest producers in Africa.
Shah wrote earlier that markets based on metal production and exports to China are likely to experience soft growth in the coming months thanks to decreased demand.
But another problem in the sub-Saharan region is widening budget deficits, which suggest that “a number of countries have been living beyond their means,” which is another reason for currency troubles.
 
It’s not as much of a problem when governments spend in public investment, which can boost long-term growth. The rising deficits in Cote d’Ivoire, Uganda and Kenya are mainly due to this type of spending, which makes it less of a concern. Mozambique and Tanzania are also running large deficits, but since they’re largely funded by foreign direct investment, their currencies will likely be more stable.
However, “the countries most likely to experience market pressure or a slowdown in growth are those that have seen a rapid increase in government current expenditure.”

The deficits of Nigeria, Ghana and Zambia are a prime example. Governments are spending more money on wages and subsidies than long-term investments.
“It is notable that public investment as a share of GDP has actually fallen in Ghana and Nigeria. And in Zambia, the rise in investment accounts for less than half of the widening in its budget deficit,” Shah wrote.
This is having an impact on currencies.

USD/CNY hit highs of 6.20, the strongest level since July 17, 2013, and was last trading at 6.19.
On Saturday, the People's Bank of China said it would let the currency move up or down by 2% from the central parity rate, a level it sets each day. Previously, the currency was allowed to rise or fall by 1% from this rate.
The central parity rate of the yuan is determined by a weighted average of prices before the market open each day.
The PBOC pledged to allow market forces to play a greater role in setting the yuan's exchange rate as it widened the band, but said it would still implement ""necessary adjustments"" to prevent any abnormal fluctuations in the currency.
The currency has fallen 0.65% against the dollar since the trading band was widened.
Some investors have viewed the decision as an indication that the central bank may want to shore up growth in the sluggish economy by effectively easing monetary conditions.
Recent data showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, while the annual rate of inflation slowed. Investors were also on edge after China’s first domestic bond default added to concerns over the health of the country’s financial sector.
Other investors have taken the view that the move is designed to ward off speculators betting on the currency's continued appreciation.

Gox.
BTC/USD held in a range between $609.00 and $635.00 on Slovenia-based BitStamp. Prices last traded at $629.00 during U.S. morning hours, up 2%, or $12.15.

According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency added 0.3% to trade at $627.60.
Bitcoin prices have been well-supported since the unexpected collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world's biggest Bitcoin exchange.
Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in Dallas on March 8, supplementing a similar petition made in Japan late last month.
Mt. Gox was forced to shut down after saying it lost approximately 850,000 Bitcoin worth nearly $500 million after hackers gained access to its systems.
Prices of the crypto currency are up nearly 36% on Bitstamp since hitting a low of $400.00 on February 25, while prices on BTC-e have gained nearly 32% since hitting a low of $430.10 also on February 25.

""As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately,"" the company said in a statement.
The news comes less than one week after Mt. Gox, once the world's biggest Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, saying it may have lost approximately 850,000 Bitcoin worth nearly $500 million after hackers gained access to its systems.

This may be the biggest of a series of setbacks bitcoin has experienced in recent months, but thankfully, elsewhere in the world, the virtual currency is still doing OK. The fall of Mt. Gox provided a surprising impetus for Chinese bitcoin enthusiasts. On Monday when Mt. Gox was shut down, bitcoin value plunged more than 12 percent. On BitStamp, another exchange, the virtual currency was trading at $568.03 on Friday, compared to $1,132 in its peak in 2013.
Beijing-based Huobi.com benefitted from the price slash, with 110,992 bitcoins changing hands in the past 24 hours alone, and about 1.38 bitcoins traded in the past seven days, which accounts for 54 percent of total trade volume during that period in the world.
Another beneficiary of the Mt. Gox fall is ANXBTC Exchange, who opened a bitcoin retail store in Hong Kong on Friday. For the first time, buyers can simply walk into the store, pay cash and send bitcoins to their virtual wallets, instead of buying with credit cards on online exchanges, said Ken Lo, CEO of ANXBTC. Lo also forecasted a bright future for the virtual currency in the Chinese markets at the opening ceremony of the store.
“Many people here think the bitcoin is undervalued, and rush to buy the currency,” Hugh Madden, CTO of ANXBTC, told MarketWatch, “This is partly why we set up the first bitcoin retail store in the city.”
Bitcoin has not been faring well in China for some months. At the end of a seemingly sensational year in China, bitcoin value began tumbling in the Chinese markets when China first banned financial institutions from trading in bitcoin in December, then restricted BTC China, then the world’s biggest exchange by trading volume, from accepting deposits in yuan. In Janauary, e-commerce giant Alibaba banned bitcoins from its online shopping sites.

Gox, once the world's biggest exchange for Bitcoin, filed for bankruptcy on Friday, blaming hackers and weakness in its own technology systems for losses of nearly half a billion dollars.
Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles apologized at a news conference at Tokyo District Court, where the company filed for bankruptcy protection, reports Reuters. 

In total, the exchange lost 750,000 Bitcoins owned by its users and 100,000 of its own Bitcoins. That represents losses of $480 million at current Bitcoin prices, or 7 percent of the estimated total of Bitcoins in circulation. 
Mt. Gox's bank account balances also showed discrepancies, though a lawyer for Mt. Gox declined to elaborate on the problems there.
The Mt. Gox exchange had liabilities of 6.5 billion yen ($63.7 million), which overshadowed its 3.84 billion yen in assets. Though it had 127,000 creditors as it became banrkupt, just over 1000 of those are Japanese.
In 2012, the Mt. Gox exchange saw average trading volumes of over 100,000 Bitcoins daily, making it by far the largest exchange, according to the Wall Street Journal. By 2014, that shrunk to 22,900 daily. Other major Bitcoin exchanges include BTC-e and Bitstamp.

In early trade USD/JPY traded flat at 102.12, AUD/USD was down 0.09% at 0.8957. while NZD/USD fell 0.04% at 0.8365.
On Thursday, the dollar weakened against most major currencies after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told U.S. legislators monetary authorities were concerned over soft economic indicators though monetary policy remains on course for now.
Disappointing weekly jobless claims numbers softened the greenback as well. Recent manufacturing, jobs and other economic indicators have disappointed markets, leaving investors unclear if recovery has hit a soft patch or if a string of winter storms has put commerce temporarily on hold.
Speaking before the Senate banking committee, Yellen told lawmakers it was hard to say how much the recent soft data was due to rough winter weather and added that the bank would remain attentive to signals on whether the recovery is progressing in line with expectations.

Gox under investigation,"Investing.com - Bitcoin prices rebounded more than 10% on Wednesday, on reports that authorities in both the U.S. and Japan have begun looking into the collapse of Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency jumped 9.9% to trade at $587.60.
The price of a Bitcoin last traded at $595.95 on Slovenia-based BitStamp, up 13.7%, while prices on BTC-e rallied 12.5% to trade at $582.00.
BitStamp is now the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange by volume, while Bulgaria-based BTC-e is the second-biggest.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that federal prosecutors based in New York had served Mt. Gox with a subpoena earlier this month. The report said the subpoena included an order for Mt. Gox to preserve certain documents.
Japanese officials also said they were looking into the matter. “At this stage the relevant financial authorities, the police, the Finance Ministry and others are gathering information on the case,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a news conference earlier Wednesday.
The website of the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange went blank on Tuesday, in the latest development to roil the virtual currency market.
Mt. Gox issued a terse statement saying, ““We should have an official announcement ready soon-ish. We are currently at a turning point for the business.”
The news comes amid rumors that the exchange had become ""insolvent"" after losing 744,408 Bitcoins, worth around $350 million at current prices, due to a years-long hacking effort that went unnoticed by the company.
Mt. Gox’s troubles started on February 7, when it was forced to halt all Bitcoin withdrawals, citing technical issues.
Prices on Mt. Gox plunged to $91.50 on February 21 as investors were disappointed with a lack of concrete details regarding progress made on resuming withdrawals on the struggling exchange.
Mark Karpeles, chief executive officer of Mt. Gox, resigned from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation on February 23. The exchange was a founding member and one of three elected industry representatives on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation.
Mt. Gox was once the world's largest Bitcoin trading exchange, with volume topping 1 million trades a day at its peak.

1211,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 24, 2014 07:25AM ET</span>",Why Mt. Gox Resigned From Bitcoin's Board,"By Sneha Shankar - Mark Karpeles, CEO of Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, resigned from the board of directors of Bitcoin Foundation on Sunday.
Jinyoung Lee Englund, director of public affairs for Bitcoin Foundation, confirmed the news of Karpeles’ resignation on Sunday night and said that it is effective immediately. The resignation is the latest development, following a string of technical difficulties on the exchange, which led to the freezing of withdrawals. 

“Effective immediately, Mt. Gox has submitted their resignation from the board of directors. We are grateful for their early and valuable contributions as a founding member in launching the Bitcoin Foundation. MtGox Co. Ltd. (Japan) held one of the three elected industry member seats. Further details, including election procedures, will be forthcoming,” a statement released by Bitcoin said, quoting Jon Matonis, Mt. Gox group's executive director.
Bitcoin Foundation’s chief scientist Gavin Andresen said that the foundation would fix these problems.
Later, Mt. Gox, which is one of the founding members of the Bitcoin Foundation, said that there is a “bug in the Bitcoin software” that could allow the transactions to be altered, causing the value of the digital currency to fall farther. Mt. Gox halted withdrawals citing technical difficulties without saying when services would resume.
Bitcoins on Mt. Gox traded at about $232 on Monday in Tokyo, while the Bitstamp index bitcoin traded at around $568, Reuters reported.
""The issues that Mt. Gox has been experiencing are due to an unfortunate interaction between Mt. Gox's implementation of their highly customized wallet software, their customer support procedures, and their unpreparedness for transaction malleability, a technical detail that allows changes to the way transactions are identified,"" Andresen said in a statement on the Foundation's blog on Feb. 10.
The resignation of Karpeles follows the departure of Charlie Shrem, CEO of BitInstant, after he was arrested in January on money laundering charges and connections to an alleged online illegal drugs marketplace.

1230,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2014 05:19AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly outlook: February 24 - 28,"Investing.com - The dollar was lower against the euro on Friday, following the release of poor U.S. housing data, but ended the week higher against the yen and most other major currencies.
The dollar slid against the euro after a report showed that U.S. existing home sales fell by a larger-than-forecast 5.1% in January, dropping to an 18-month low. 
The report came in the wake of other weaker-than-expected U.S. economic indications, fuelling concerns over the growth outlook.
EUR/USD ended Friday’s session up 0.15% at 1.3739, holding below the seven-week high of 1.3772 reached on Tuesday. For the week, the pair gained 0.26%.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY hit 102.82, the highest since January 31 and was last up 0.22% to 102.49. The pair ended the week 0.41% higher.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s January meeting showed that officials agreed the current pace of reductions to the bank’s asset purchase program would remain unchanged, so long as the economy shows signs of improvement.
The yen remained under pressure after the Bank of Japan voted to extend a bank lending scheme on Tuesday, in an attempt to boost the effectiveness of its monetary stimulus program.
The dollar was also higher against the pound after data on Friday showed that U.K. retail sales fell 1.5% in January, worse than expectations for a 1% decline.
GBP/USD was down 0.22% to 1.6614 at the close, and ended the week down 0.62%.
The Canadian dollar ended the week lower against the U.S. dollar after data on Friday showed that domestic retail sales posted their largest one-month drop in a year in December.
Official data showed that Canadian retail sales fell 1.8%, far more than expectations for a 0.5% decline.
USD/CAD hit 1.1196, the strongest level since January 31 and was last up 0.09% to 1.1108. For the week, the pair advanced 1.40%.

1232,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 21, 2014 03:28PM ET</span>",Dollar moves sideways on soft U.S. housing data ,"Investing.com - The greenback traded mixed against most major currencies on Friday after soft U.S. housing sales numbers sent investors betting that the Federal Reserve will taper its monthly bond-buying program at a very gradual pace.
The Fed's $65 billion in monthly bond purchases suppresses borrowing costs to incentivize investing and hiring to spur recovery, weakening the dollar as a side effect.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.19% at 1.3745.
The National Association of Realtors reported earlier that U.S. existing home sales declined 5.1% to 4.62 million units last month, outpacing expectations for a 4.3% drop to 4.68 million units.
In December, existing home sales were revised to a 0.8% rise to 487 million units from an initially estimated 1% increase.
The Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding the pace at which it winds down is asset purchases, and the soft numbers stoked expectations the U.S. central bank will wind down its stimulus program very gradually.
Giving the dollar some support, however, were perceptions that the disappointing numbers were the product of a string of blizzards sweeping across the country that disrupted commerce, and more robust indicators will return once skies clear.
The euro, meanwhile, continued to battle headwinds after Markit Economics reported Thursday that the euro zone composite output purchasing managers’ index ticked down to a two-month low of 52.7 this month, down from January’s 31-month high of 52.9.
Analysts were expecting a 53.1 reading, and the report softened the euro due to the continent's still high unemployment rates and soft inflationary pressures, which many think will prompt the European Central Bank to loosen policy if recovery flounders.
The dollar was up against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.26% at 102.54, and down against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF down 0.29% at 0.8870.
The yen came under pressure after the minutes of its January policy meeting released earlier revealed that the Bank of Japan decided to avoid any misunderstanding about its monetary easing program, the bank needed ""to provide a clear explanation that it did not strictly set this to end in two years.""
In April last year, the BoJ had announced a policy overhaul that aimed to double the money supply and achieve 2% inflation within about two years.
The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.05% at 1.6642.
U.K. retail sales dropped 1.5% in January, according to official data, outpacing consensus forecasts for a 1% decline. Retail sales in December were revised down to a 2.5% increase from a previously estimated 2.6% gain.
On a yearly basis, U.K. retail sales rose 4.3% last month, compared to expectations for a 5% increase, after a 5.3% advance in December.
The numbers softened the pound.
The dollar was up against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD up 0.26% at 1.1128, AUD/USD down 0.39% at 0.8970 and NZD/USD down 0.26% at 0.8282.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.06% at 80.27.

Gox as announcement disappoints,"Investing.com - Bitcoin prices plunged more than 40% on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox Exchange on Thursday, as investors were disappointed with a lack of concrete details regarding progress made on resuming withdrawals on the troubled exchange.
BTC/USD fell to a session low of $134.10 on Mt. Gox, before trimming losses to trade at $156.95 during U.S. morning hours, down 40.5%.
In a statement released on its website earlier Thursday, troubled Bitcoin exchange operator Mt. Gox said, “In addition to the technical issue, this week we have experienced some security problems, and as a result we had to relocate Mt. Gox to our previous ofﬁce building in Shibuya.”
“The move, combined with some other security and technical challenges, pushed back our progress,” the company said in the statement.
The statement continued, “As much as we didn’t want to only provide an “update on an update”, this is the current status. We are committed to solving this issue and will provide more information as soon as possible to keep everyone in the loop.”
Mt. Gox, which was once the world's largest Bitcoin trading exchange, was forced to halt all Bitcoin withdrawals on February 7 due to a technical issue, leading to steep declines as traders shied away from the virtual currency.
The company said earlier in the week that its customers should be able to withdraw Bitcoins from their accounts again “soon”, although it is still not sure just how long the process of restoring access will take.
It had promised to issue an update on its progress no later than Thursday.
Elsewhere, the price of a Bitcoin last traded at $595.00 on Slovenia-based BitStamp, down 5.5%, while prices on BTC-e traded at $578.00, down 5.85%.
BitStamp is the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, while Bulgaria-based BTC-e is the third-biggest by volume.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency lost 5% to trade at $586.75.
Bitcoin is digital cash for the internet and it is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.
Prices of the virtual currency soared to an all-time high of USD1,241.10 on November 29. It was trading at USD100 in early October."

“A dip in the euro zone PMI provides a reminder that the region’s recovery continues to be uneven and fragile,” Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said.

Japanese exports rose 9.5% in January against the forecast of 12.6% increase and the rise of 15.3% a year earlier. Imports went up by 25% against the expectation of 21.8% increase and previous rise of 24.7%.

On Wednesday, the greenback traded mixed to higher against most major currencies after the Federal Reserve said in the minutes of its January policy meeting that it should continue tapering its monthly bond-purchasing program, which weakens the greenback to spur recovery.
At its Jan. 28-29 policy meeting, the Fed voted to trim its monthly asset purchasing program to $65 billion from $75 billion and stressed benchmark interest rates will stay at 0.00-0.25% until the unemployment rates approaches 6.5% or even dips below that mark, depending on the health of the economy in the context of price stability.
The minutes released on Wednesday, however, revealed that monetary authorities debated ditching language suggesting rates may rise if the unemployment rate falls past 6.5%, a policy tool known as forward guidance.
""Participants agreed that, with the unemployment rate approaching 6-1/2 percent, it would soon be appropriate for the Committee to change its forward guidance in order to provide information about its decisions regarding the federal funds rate after that threshold was crossed,"" the minutes reported.
The unemployment rate currently stands at 6.6% though many still remain out of the labor force due to fruitless job searches, which artificially lowers the percentage headline unemployment rate.
Those out of work but not actively seek jobs are not counted as part of the labor force.
Elsewhere, Fed officials were willing to overlook January's soft jobs report and other economic indicators taking into account a string of powerful winter storms may have disrupted commerce.
While some hawkish member felt the time to hike interest rates will come soon, consensus pointed to keeping rates on hold while dismantling monthly bond purchases, which gave the greenback some support.
""All members agreed that the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions and the likelihood of continuing improvement indicated that it would be appropriate to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases at this meeting,"" the minutes read.
""Members again judged that, if the economy continued to develop as anticipated, further reductions would be undertaken in measured steps.""
Elsewhere on Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. housing starts fell 16% in January to 880,000 units, outpacing expectations for a 5.7% drop, though a series of winter storms may have weakened the indicator and not a downtick in demand.
The number of building permits issued last month declined by 5.4% to a seasonally adjusted 937,000 units, outpacing expectations for a 1.8% decline.

1263,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2014 12:53PM ET</span>",Natural gas hits 4-year highs on hopes for bullish supply report,"Investing.com - Natural gas futures soared to four-year highs on Wednesday amid speculation that rough winter weather has taken its toll on U.S. inventories and will reflect in Thursday's supply report.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in March traded at $6.029 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 8.61%. The commodity hit session high of $6.084 and a low of $5.561.
The March contract settled up 6.46% on Tuesday to end at $5.551 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $5.372 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at $6.108, the high from Jan. 7, 2010.
A string of winter storms plowing across the southern, eastern and northeastern U.S. last week likely prompted thermal power plants to burn more natural gas to meet demand for heating, investors concluded, hoping Thursday's supply report will reveal such a scenario.
Early withdrawal estimates for Thursday’s storage data range from 212 billion cubic feet to 268 billion cubic feet. Natural gas supplies fell by 127 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.686 trillion cubic feet as of last week, the lowest for this time of year since 2004.
Stockpiles of the fuel are likely to finish below 1 trillion cubic feet by the last week of March, the formal end of the winter heating season, for the first time since 2003.
Natural gas inventories have fallen sharply since November as frigid temperatures and heavy winter snows in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.
Forecasts for more cold weather fueled the rally as well.
Weather service provider MDA Weather predicted below-normal temperatures for a good chunk of the country in its six-to-10-day outlook.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in April were up 0.31% and trading at $102.42 a barrel, while heating oil for March delivery were up 0.87% and trading at $3.1288 per gallon.

Gox Exchange on Monday, more than recouping the previous day’s losses, after the company issued a statement on Bitcoin withdrawals earlier in the day.
BTC/USD rose to a session high of USD390.00 on Mt. Gox, before trimming gains to trade at USD380.10 during U.S. morning hours, up 57.7%.
In a statement released on its website earlier Monday, troubled Bitcoin exchange operator Mt. Gox said it has “implemented a solution that should enable withdrawals and mitigate any issues caused by transaction malleability.”  According to the statement, “MtGox now has a workaround that will use a unique identiﬁer created by Blockchain to show whether transactions have been modiﬁed or not. This will prevent any fraudulent use of the malleability issue and protect the assets of our customers.""
“With this new system in place, MtGox should be able to resume withdrawals soon. At the beginning we will do so at a moderated pace and with new daily/monthly limits in place to prevent any problems with the new system and to take into account current market conditions.""
Mt. Gox, which was once the world's largest Bitcoin trading exchange, was forced to halt all Bitcoin withdrawals on February 7 due to a technical issue, leading to steep declines as traders shied away from the virtual currency.
Elsewhere, the price of a Bitcoin last traded at USD645.05 on Slovenia-based BitStamp, while prices on BTC-e traded at USD631.45. BitStamp is the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, while Bulgaria-based BTC-e is the third-biggest by volume.

Bitcoin is digital cash for the internet and it is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

Gox to hit USD230 as troubles continue,"Investing.com - Bitcoin prices lost half their value to hit USD230 on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox Exchange on Sunday, as traders shied away from the virtual currency amid ongoing concerns over withdrawal issues.
BTC/USD fell to a session low of USD220.30 on Mt. Gox, before trimming losses to trade at USD253.90 during U.S. morning hours, down 45.1%.
Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was forced to halt all Bitcoin withdrawals on February 7 due to a technical issue, with the issue yet to be fully resolved.
Mt. Gox was once the world's largest Bitcoin trading exchange, with volume topping 1 million trades a day at its peak. It is now the third-largest Bitcoin exchange.
Meanwhile, sentiment remained jittery after Bitcoin marketplace Silk Road 2 was hacked over the weekend, with hackers stealing approximately 4,500 Bitcoin worth nearly USD2.7 million in the latest development to roil the virtual currency.
The hackers exploited the transaction malleability bug, the same bug that forced Mt. Gox to halt all withdrawals.
Elsewhere, the price of a Bitcoin last traded at USD631.95 on Slovenia-based BitStamp, while prices on BTC-e traded at USD596.20. BitStamp is the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, while Bulgaria-based BTC-e is the second-biggest.
BitStamp allowed redemptions to resume on Friday, three days after the exchange halted customer withdrawals to deal with cyber attacks against its platform.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from the major exchanges, prices of the crypto-currency dropped 5.2% to hit USD611.75.
Bitcoin is digital cash for the internet and it is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.

1322,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 16, 2014 05:20AM ET</span>",Forex - Weekly outlook: February 17 - 21,"Investing.com - The euro rose to a three-week high against the dollar on Friday, as better-than-expected euro zone fourth quarter growth data allayed fears over more monetary tightening by the European Central Bank.
The common currency was boosted after data showed that the euro zone economy expanded 0.3% in the three months to December and expanded 0.5% from the same period a year earlier.
Market expectations had been for quarterly growth of 0.2% and a year-over-year increase of 0.5%.
EUR/USD hit 1.3715, the strongest since January 27 and was last up 0.09% to 1.3691. For the week, the pair gained 0.35%.
Meanwhile, the pound ended the week at more than three-year highs against the dollar after the Bank of England revised up its forecast for growth this year and indicated that it may raise interest rates next year.
GBP/USD ended Friday’s session up 0.55% at 1.6748, the highest since November 2009. For the week, the pair jumped 2.10%.
The dollar was lower against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.33% to 101.84 at Friday’s close. For the week, the pair was down 0.30%.
The drop in the dollar came after data on Friday showed that U.S. industrial production fell 0.3% from a month earlier in January, compared to expectations for a 0.3% gain.
The data fuelled concerns that the economic recovery has lost momentum since the end of last year as inclement winter weather weighed on growth.
The dollar’s losses were held in check by expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to scale back its stimulus program.
In her first Congressional testimony since her appointment as Fed Chair, Janet Yellen said Wednesday that the central bank would continue to gradually reduce the pace of its asset purchase program.
She also reiterated that the Fed plans to hold interest rates at zero “well past” the time the jobless rate falls below 6.5%.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.13% at 1.3698.
Less-than-stellar economic indicators hitting the wire in the U.S. this week softened the greenback by reminding investors the Federal Reserve won't rush to taper the pace of its monthly bond purchases, which tend to weaken the currency by keeping long-term interest rates low.
Earlier Friday, the preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index remained unchanged at 81.2 for February, beating expectations for a fall to 80.6, which gave the greenback some support.
However, the Federal Reserve reported that U.S. industrial production fell 0.3% in January, defying expectations for a 0.3% rise after a 0.3% increase the previous month.
Data also showed that U.S. import prices rose 0.1% last month, confounding expectations for a 0.1% downtick after a 0.2% rise in December.

Fed asset purchases weaken the dollar by suppressing interest rates, which tends to bolster assets like stocks and commodities.
While investors recognized that inclement winter weather may be watering down data as opposed to waning demand, the dollar continued to slump anyway on sentiments that a string of winter storms may have been strong enough to make a broader dent in recovery.

In the six months since forward guidance was implemented the U.K. unemployment rate has fallen to 7.1% from 7.8%.
The bank outlined new forward guidance, saying that it will not raise rates until the spare capacity in the U.K. economy has been fully absorbed, which it does not see happening until 2015.
The bank said it would consider a broader range of indicators, including the unemployment rate, wages and productivity and business surveys when deciding to raise rates, and added that when rates rise they will do so only gradually.

1364,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2014 06:37AM ET</span>",Bitcoin plunges as hackers launch attack on exchanges,"Investing.com - Bitcoin prices plunged on Wednesday, after the two largest Bitcoin-trading exchanges came under attack from hackers in the latest development to roil the virtual currency.
Slovenia-based Bitstamp said it halted customer withdrawals to deal with the issue on Tuesday night. BTC-e, which is based in Bulgaria, said it was also experiencing delays in crediting certain transactions.
Both exchanges described the problem as a denial-of-service attack, according to comments made by the companies on their websites. In denial-of-service attacks, hackers essentially disable a website by flooding it with information requests.
BitStamp is the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, while BTC-e is the second-biggest.
The news comes after Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was forced to halt all Bitcoin withdrawals due to a technical issue late last week.
Mt. Gox was once the world's largest Bitcoin trading exchange, with volume topping 1 million trades a day at its peak. It is now the third-largest Bitcoin exchange.
BTC/USD tumbled 8.9% to trade at USD514.00 on Mt. Gox.
The price of a Bitcoin last traded at USD653.50 on BitStamp, while prices on BTC-e traded at USD641.10.
According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, which averages prices from exchanges including Mt. Gox, prices of the crypto-currency dropped 2.75% to hit USD651.00.
Bitcoin is digital cash for the internet and it is not backed by a government or central bank to regulate or issue it. It can be used to purchase goods and services from stores and online retailers.
Prices of the virtual currency soared to an all-time high of USD1,241.10 on November 29. It was trading at USD100 in early October."

1409,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 09, 2014 07:57AM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD weekly outlook: February 10 - 14,"Investing.com - The Australian dollar rose to more than a three-week high against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, as traders reassessed their expectations for how quickly the Federal Reserve will roll back its stimulus program following the release of mixed U.S. employment data.
AUD/USD rose to 0.8999 on Friday, the pair’s highest since January 14, before subsequently consolidating at 0.8959 by close of trade, up 0.02% for the day and 2.31% higher for the week.
The pair is likely to find support at 0.8872, the low from February 5 and resistance at 0.8999, Friday’s high.
Data on Friday showed that the U.S. economy added 113,000 jobs in January, well below expectations for jobs growth of 185,000, after December's lackluster gain of 75,000 jobs.
It was the weakest two-month stretch of job creation in three years as inclement weather contributed to a slowdown in hiring.
Yet the report also showed that the number of people participating in the labor force edged up to 63% from a 30-year low of 62.8% last month, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked down to a five year low 6.6% from 6.7% in December.
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its economic growth and inflation forecasts on Friday.
In its quarterly monetary policy statement, the RBA said that ""over the past few months, there have been further signs that very stimulatory monetary policy is working to support economic activity.”
The central bank projected core inflation of 2.25% to 3.25% through December 2014, a 0.25% increase compared to what was initially estimated three months earlier.
The RBA predicted that gross domestic product will rise by 2.25% to 3.25% through December, ""primarily owing to the lower exchange rate, which is expected to boost exports and restrain imports.""
The statement came after the RBA on Tuesday shifted its policy stance away from easing rates, citing higher than forecast inflation. The RBA left rates on hold at 2.5%, saying ""the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.""
Official data released Thursday showed that Australia's trade surplus expanded to AUD0.47 billion in December, from AUD0.08 billion the previous month. Analysts had expected the trade balance to swing into a deficit of AUD0.27 billion in December.
A separate report showed that retail sales in Australia rose 0.5% in December, more than the expected 0.4% uptick, after a 0.7% increase in November.
Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed that speculators increased their bearish bets on the Australian dollar in the week ending February 4.
Net shorts totaled 55,523 contracts, down 15.5% from the previous week’s total of 65,723 net shorts.

In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was up 0.25% at 1.3625.
The U.S. Labor Department reported earlier that the economy added 113,000 jobs in January, less than an expected 185,000 increase. December's figure was revised up to a 75,000 rise from a previously estimated 74,000 increase.
The report also showed that 142,000 jobs were added in the U.S. private sector last month, compared to expectations for a 185,000 increase. In December, the number of jobs created in the private sector was revised up to 89,000 from a previously estimated 87,000.
The U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 6.6% last month, from 6.7% in December. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged in January.
The numbers softened the dollar by stoking expectations that the Federal Reserve will taper its USD65 billion monthly bond-buying program gradually.
Fed asset purchases tend to weaken the dollar by driving down interest rates as long as they remain in effect.
Capping the euro's gains, however, German industrial production fell 0.6% in December, confounding expectations for a 0.5% increase, after an upwardly revised 2.4% gain the previous month.
A separate report showed that Germany's trade surplus narrowed to EUR18.5 billion in December, from EUR18.9 billion the previous month. Analysts had expected the trade surplus to narrow to EUR17.3 billion in December.

Data released on Friday showed that U.S. consumer spending rose 0.4% in December, above expectations for an increase of 0.2%. 
A separate report showed that the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index ticked down to 81.2 in January from 82.5 in December, but was better than the preliminary reading of 80.4 and forecasts for a reading of 81.0.
The reports came one day after data showed that the U.S. economy grew 3.2% in the fourth quarter, in line with expectations.
The data fuelled hopes that the recovery in the world’s largest economy could withstand reductions to the Fed’s asset purchase program and turmoil in emerging markets.
In the week ahead, investors will be keenly anticipating Friday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January after December’s report showed that the economy added far fewer jobs than expected.Thursday’s rate decision by the ECB will also be in focus.

The pair is likely to find near-term support at 101.60 and resistance at 102.92, Friday’s high.
Safe haven demand for the yen was boosted after data on Friday showed that the annual rate of euro zone inflation slowed in January, fuelling expectations that the European Central Bank may need to tighten policy in order to support the recovery in the region.
The annual rate of euro zone inflation slowed to 0.7% in January, Eurostat said, after a 0.8% gain in December. Analysts had expected the inflation rate to tick up to 0.9%.
It was the fourth consecutive month the inflation rate came in at less than 1% and was well below the ECB’s target of 2%. The ECB unexpectedly cut rates to a record low 0.25% when inflation fell to a four-year low of 0.7% in October.

1503,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2014 02:40PM ET</span>",Dollar gains on solid U.S. consumer sentiment data,"Investing.com - The greenback firmed against most major currencies on Friday after investors applauded a widely-watched gauge of consumer sentiment.
In U.S. trading on Friday, EUR/USD was down 0.41% at 1.3449.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of U.S. consumer sentiment came in at 81.2 in January, beating expectations for a 81.0 reading.
Also in the U.S. official data revealed consumer spending rose 0.4% in December, beating expectations for a 0.2% reading though personal income came in unchanged, missing expectations for a 0.0% gain.
The data kept expectations firm that the Federal Reserve will continue tapering its monthly bond-buying program as the year progresses.
Currently, the Fed is buying USD65 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month from banks, which weakens the dollar to spur recovery.
The program began in 2012, starting out at USD85 billion in Fed asset purchases a month.
The dollar was down against the yen, with USD/JPY down 0.36% at 102.35, and up against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.33% at 0.9058.
Concerns the emerging markets may be cooling, as evidenced by soft Chinese manufacturing data, have weakened emerging-market currencies and roiled stock markets worldwide, though the yen has served as the safe-haven currency of choice during the turbulence.
Japanese data also supported the yen on Friday.
According to figures released by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Japan’s industrial production in December rose by 1.1% against the expected rise of 1.2% but up from a previous fall of 0.1%.
Also in Japan, the Statistics Bureau reported that country's headline and core consumer price indices both remained unchanged at 0.7%, in line with expectations.
The greenback was up against the pound, with GBP/USD down 0.31% at 1.6434.
The dollar was mixed against its cousins in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, with USD/CAD down 0.30% at 1.1124, AUD/USD down 0.55% at 0.8748 and NZD/USD down 1.00% at 0.8085.

Turkey's central bank raised its overnight lending rate to 12% from 7.75%, raised its one-week repo rate to 10% from 4.5% and raised its overnight borrowing rate to 8% from 3.5%.
In its rate statement, the bank said its new “tight monetary policy stance will be sustained until there is a significant improvement in the inflation outlook”.
The move exceeded market expectations and eased concerns over the broad based selloff in stocks and emerging market currencies in recent sessions, triggered by worries over the impact of cuts in Federal Reserve stimulus and concerns over a possible slowdown in China.
The lira had fallen to a series of record lows against the dollar since the beginning of the month, dropping almost 11%, before rebounding ahead of the emergency central bank meeting on Tuesday.
The central bank left rates unchanged at its scheduled meeting last week, amid political pressure to avoid higher borrowing costs, which could act as a drag on growth. The lira continued to spiral to record lows after a direct currency market intervention by Turkey’s central bank on Thursday failed to stem the steep depreciation in the currency.
Turkey’s lira is seen as particularly vulnerable to reductions in the Fed’s asset purchase program, as the country relies heavily on foreign investment to fund its huge current account gap.
The selloff in the lira was also fuelled by investor concerns over local political tensions after a wide ranging corruption probe launched in December focusing on figures close to the government forced a cabinet reshuffle.
The lira remained vulnerable ahead of Wednesday’s policy statement by the Fed amid expectations that the bank will cut its asset purchase program by another $10 billion, to $65 billion per month. The central bank announced the first cut to its stimulus program in December.

1558,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2014 06:34AM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar lower vs. Turkish lira ahead of central bank meeting,"Investing.com - The dollar was lower against the Turkish lira for a second session on Tuesday after Turkey’s central bank signaled that it may hike interest rates to arrest the steep depreciation in the lira, ahead of an emergency policy meeting later in the day.
USD/TRY fell to 2.2538, a one-week low, and was last down 0.68% to 2.2675. The pair rose to record highs of 2.3895 on Monday.
The lira found support after Turkey's central bank suggested that an interest rate increase may be implemented to protect the weakening lira and revised its forecast for inflation sharply higher.
The bank lifted its forecast for year-end inflation to 6.6% from 5.3%, saying the rise in exchange rates and currency market volatility would contribute to higher inflation.
Speaking ahead of the emergency monetary policy meeting Governor Erdem Basci indicated that a rate increase is possible after the lira fell to the latest in a series of record lows against the dollar on Monday.
""No one should be in doubt that the central bank will use all its policy tools to converge inflation to the 5% target…Our aim at tonight's meeting is to avoid a deterioration of pricing behavior and to take steps to ensure price stability,"" he said.
""We won't refrain from implementing permanent policy tightening if needed.""
The central bank has held back from interest rate increases, amid political pressure to avoid higher borrowing costs, which could act as a drag on growth.
The bank announced the emergency policy meeting on Monday, citing “unhealthy price developments” after the lira slipped below 2.30 to the dollar, amid a broad based selloff in emerging markets. Concerns over the impact of the Federal Reserve scaling back its stimulus program, along with fears over a possible slowdown in China triggered the selloff.
Turkey’s lira is seen as particularly vulnerable to reductions in the Fed’s asset purchase program, as the country relies heavily on foreign investment to fund its huge current account gap.
The lira remained vulnerable ahead of Wednesday’s policy statement by the Fed amid expectations that the bank will cut its asset purchase program by another $10 billion, to $75 billion per month. The central bank announced the first cut to its stimulus program in December.
The selloff in the lira has been further fuelled by investor concerns over local political tensions, after a wide ranging corruption probe launched in December, focusing on figures close to the ruling APK party, forced a cabinet reshuffle.
The euro was also lower against the lira, with EUR/TRY falling 0.80% to 3.0969, down from Monday’s all-time high of 3.2729."

1580,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 27, 2014 04:34AM ET</span>",Forex - Turkish lira at new lows as emerging market rout deepens,"Investing.com - The Turkish lira fell to new lows against the U.S. dollar on Monday, as a broad based exodus from emerging market currencies continued amid a combination of concerns over the impact of the Federal Reserve scaling back its stimulus program and a possible slowdown in China.
USD/TRY rose to highs of 2.3798 and was last up 1.60% to 2.3746.
The lira continued to spiral to record lows after a direct currency market intervention by Turkey’s central bank on Thursday failed to stem the steep depreciation in the currency.
The central bank cited “unhealthy price developments” after the lira slipped below 2.30 to the dollar amid a broad based selloff of emerging markets.
The selloff in financial markets was triggered after data last week pointed to a steeper than expected slowdown in Chinese manufacturing, fuelling fears that weakness could spread to other emerging market economies.
The move came two days after Turkey’s central bank left rates on hold, despite deteriorating inflation expectations and a 10% decline in the lira since December.
Turkey’s lira is seen as particularly vulnerable to reductions in the Fed’s asset purchase program, as the country relies heavily on foreign investment to fund its huge current account gap.
The selloff in the lira has been further fuelled by investor concerns over local political tensions after a wide ranging corruption probe launched in December, focusing on figures close to the ruling APK party, forced a cabinet reshuffle.
Market participants were looking ahead to the outcome of the Fed’s monthly meeting on Wednesday, amid expectations for a reduction in its bond buying program to USD65 billion from the current USD75 billion.Elsewhere, Argentina’s peso was in the spotlight after falling 11% against the dollar on Friday, its steepest fall since the country's 2002 financial crisis. USD/ARS edged up 0.02% to 7.9909, holding just below Friday’s highs of 8.1502.
Argentina's central bank said Friday it was loosening strict foreign exchange rules, giving up its traditional policy of supporting the currency through interventions.
Meanwhile, South Africa’s rand and the Russian ruble were trading close to five year lows against the dollar. USD/ZAR was up 1.12% to 11.2127, while USD/RUB climbed 0.77% to 34.791."

1600,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 24, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>",The Real Lesson From The Current Emerging Market Currencies Sell-off ,"By Moran Zhang - The real lesson from the current emerging market currencies selloff (the worst in five years) is that investors need to discriminate between individual emerging markets because the emerging world has become a far more diverse place over the past decade, according to Capital Economics.
“In the past, financial crises have tended to sweep from one EM to another, primarily because they shared many of the same vulnerabilities. The financial crisis that began in Thailand in 1997 swept through the rest of Asia, hit Russia and also caused a wobble in parts of Latin America. Today the emerging world is a very different place,” Neil Shearing of Capital Economics wrote in a note.
However, investors today are still treating the emerging world with little differentiation. Growing concerns about the impact of slower growth in China, further stimulus cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and mounting political problems in Turkey, Argentina and Ukraine, led to a global flight from emerging market assets.
The Turkish lira plunged to a record, while South Africa’s rand slumped to a five-year low and Ukraine’s hryvnia sank to a four-year low. The Russian ruble dropped to a four-year low, Brazil’s real fell to a five-month low and the Indian rupee slipped to a two-month low.
Meanwhile, Argentina’s peso suffered its steepest daily decline since the country’s 2002 financial crisis, as the South American nation’s central bank stepped back from its efforts to protect the currency.
Shearing noted that for the past three years, Argentina’s authorities have been selling foreign exchange reserves to cushion the fall in the currency that would otherwise result from a combination of capital flight and deterioration in the country’s current account balance.
The consequence has been that FX reserves have fallen from a peak of $47 billion in March 2011 to a seven-year low of $25 billion in November last year (latest data). “It seems that that the authorities have decided that the price of defending the currency is too great and have bowed to the inevitable,” Shearing said.
In light of the recent development, Shearing stressed that “the need for investors to discriminate between individual EMs has never been greater.”
He placed the 56 emerging markets Capital Economics follows into five separate categories and listed the countries in specific groups that have been in the spotlight recently.

1602,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 24, 2014 10:30AM ET</span>","All That Glitters Is Not Gold, Not Even Bitcoin","By Sophie Song - Nobel Laureate economist Robert Shiller, U.S. Treasury secretary Jack Lew, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon, all spoke out against bitcoin at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Speaking on a panel on the topic of digital trends in financial markets, Shiller, an expert in financial bubbles, said that as a currency, bitcoin is a return to the dark ages, and a classic bubble.
“It is a bubble,” Shiller said, according to the Business Insider. “There is no question about it. It’s just an amazing example of a bubble.”

Shiller added that the computer science behind the virtual currency is an “inspiration,” it is not an economic advance.
“It’s not such a great idea,” he said he tells his students, but he’s blown away by how much fascination the virtual currency has engendered.
Lew and Dimon spoke on the regulations and possible abuses surrounding the virtual currency, which can be handled anonymously.
“From the government’s point of view, we have to make sure it does not become an avenue to funding illegal activities or to funding activities that have malign purposes like terrorist activities,” Lew told CNBC at Davos. “It is an anonymous form of transaction and it offers places for people to hide.”
Dimon said that bitcoin would be subjected to the same regulatory standards as other payment systems, and “that will probably be the end of them.” JPMorgan has been cautious in offering services to entrepreneurs in virtual currency, while rival bank Wells Fargo has launched a group to examine how it might offer bitcoin-related services, the Financial Times reported on Friday.
The virtual currency has proven very volatile in the last year, having experienced several peaks in value in late 2013, at times reaching over $1,000 before falling again due to a ban from Chinese banks.
Dimon also echoed Shiller’s sentiment, and said that bitcoin is “a terrible store of value” that “can be replicated over and over,” as well as “used for illicit purposes.”

1613,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 23, 2014 03:00PM ET</span>",Time To Cry For Argentina? Peso Plunges,"By Mike Obel - The value of Argentina's money fell hard Thursday in its steepest loss in more than 10 years after the central bank gave up trying to support the currency. Analysts now expect inflation to surge in the once-mighty economy as odds of a recession climb.
The peso, which has been losing value since November, dropped more than 15 percent in two hours Thursday to 8.18 against the U.S. dollar before paring losses to close at 7.9 to the dollar. On the black market, the peso is trading at 12 to the U.S. dollar. By contrast, the U.S. dollar was worth 1.77 pesos on Jan. 22, 2002.

""The sharp drop will aggravate inflation, although the impact may be mitigated by the fact that some imports will already be purchased at the (much weaker) black market exchange rate,"" said Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist for London-based Capital Economics. ""The bigger picture, though, is that the economic mismanagement of the past decade has once again pushed the country to the brink of a balance of payments crisis.""
For the past three years, Argentina's monetary authorities have been using foreign exchange reserves to cushion the peso's decline, which stems from capital flight and the economy's deteriorating current account balance, he said. The upshot has been that foreign exchange reserves have tumbled from a peak of $47 billion in March 2011 to a seven-year low of $25 billion in November.
""Where we go from here is difficult to say. We had previously forecast that the peso would fall to 9 to the dollar by next year, but given that it has fallen from 6.95 to the dollar to 8 to the dollar in the space of a few hours there is clearly a danger that it falls much further. The obvious strains in Argentina’s balance of payments combined with its low level of foreign exchange reserve coverage and general economic mismanagement means that this could be the start of a more messy adjustment in the currency,"" Shearing said in a note.
The day's development also strengthened an earlier prediction Capital Economics had made about a recession in Argentina.
""Our forecast that the economy would slide into recession this year looked bold a few months ago; all of a sudden that doesn’t seem so implausible,"" Shearing said.

Both currencies continued to see support from the International Monetary Fund's decision this week to hike its global economic growth forecast to 3.7% from 2014 from an October forecast for 3.6% growth.

Many market participants held firm on their expectations for the Fed to trim its quantitative easing program to USD65 billion from the current USD75 billion at its next policy meeting that wraps up on Jan. 29.
Fed bond purchases aim to prop up the economy by suppressing long-term interest rates, thus weakening the dollar as a side effect as investors flock to asset classes like stocks.The euro was down against the pound, with EUR/GBP sliding 0.65% to 0.8176, and flat against the yen, with EUR/JPY trading at 141.44.

It was the largest drop in unemployment since 1997 the ONS said.
Analysts had expected the jobless rate to fall to 7.3% from 7.4% in the three months to October.

Turkey’s central bank left interest rates unchanged at 4.5%, in a widely anticipated decision. The announcement came amid escalating concerns over the lira’s recent sharp depreciation and worsening inflation expectations.

Inflation in Turkey rose 7.4% last year, above the government forecast for 6.2%. The government has forecast inflation of 5.3% for 2014. However, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan warned last week that inflation might come in higher than expected because of the lira’s depreciation.

1666,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2014 06:22PM ET</span>",Forex - NZD/USD down despite higher Q4 inflation,"Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar fell during morning Asian trade on Tuesday, easing after an initial spike following fourth quarter inflation figures that rose more than expected.  Data released by Statistics New Zealand showed inflation rose 0.1% in the fourth quarter and up 1.6% on year, taking annual inflation up to a level last seen in the first quarter of 2012. Market expectations were for a 0.1% drop on the quarter and gain of 1.5% on the year. The inflation gain could put pressure on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to hike its official cash rate in early 2014 on accelerating economic growth amid housing and other capacity constraints. Later today the Bank of Japan is scheduled to start its two-day policy board meeting with a decision due on Wednesday. The Bank of Japan's nine-member board is expected to stand pat on monetary policy and may say downside risks in overseas markets have eased from the state of play seen in the semi-annual Outlook Report issued in October.  AUD/USD traded down 0.04% at 0.8807, USD/JPY traded down 0.02% at 104.15, and NZD/USD traded down 0.05% to 83.20.

USD/TRY rose to highs of 2.2506 and was last up 0.32% to 2.2408.
The Turkish lira tumbled amid expectations that the country’s central bank will keep rates on hold at 4.5% in spite of deteriorating inflation expectations.
Turkey’s central bank has held back from interest rate increases, amid pressure from the government to avoid higher borrowing costs, which could act as a drag on growth. It has instead tried to prop up the lira through currency market interventions.
The lira has weakened dramatically in recent months as concerns over Turkey’s large current account deficit and political turmoil prompted a selloff in the currency.
Emerging market currencies, in particular the lira, have come under heavy selling pressure since the Federal Reserve’s decision to begin scaling back its asset purchase program in December. Emerging market economies rely heavily on foreign investment to fund their current account gaps.
Concerns over a corruption scandal surrounding Turkey's ruling APK party also continued to weigh. The lira has fallen to a series of record lows since a wide ranging investigation into alleged bribery was launched on December 17, resulting in the resignation of three cabinet ministers, following their sons’ arrest.
The euro also rose to record highs against the Turkish lira. EUR/TRY hit highs of 3.0467 and was last up 0.28% to 3.0343."
