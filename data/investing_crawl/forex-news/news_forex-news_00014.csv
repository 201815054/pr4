40,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2013 11:27PM ET</span>",Forex - NZD/USD rises on hawkish RBNZ view,"Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar climbed against its U.S. rival during Thursday’s Asian session following hawkish comments from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. In Asian trading Thursday, NZD/USD rose 0.43% to 0.8118. The pair was likely to find support at 0.7962, the low of September 9 and resistance at 0.8162, the high of August 19. While RBNZ left interest rates at 2.5%, Governor Graeme Wheeler confirmed that a rate hike is on the table for 2014, something that many traders previously believed to be the case. ""With the inflation pressures that have the potential to build up, given the capacity constraints in the economy, we will need to raise interest rates,"" said Wheeler without confirming exactly when rates could rise. With the developed world awash in quantitative easing and ultra-low interest rates, RBNZ would be one of the first central banks to raise rates. Wheeler is betting new limits on riskier mortgages will curb demand for property and give him scope to leave rates unchanged for as long as possible to avoid fueling demand for the New Zealand dollar, according to Bloomberg.  ""The extent and timing of the rise in policy rates will depend largely on the degree to which the momentum in the housing market and construction sector spills over into broader demand and inflation pressures,"" said RBNZ in a statement. Elsewhere, AUD/NZD slid 1.15% to 1.1412 after the Australian Bureau of Statistics said the country’s unemployment rate rose to 5.8% last month from 5.7% in July. Analysts expected that increase. The Statistics Bureau added that the Australian employment change fell by 10,800 in August after a July drop of 11,400. The July number was revised lower after an initial reading showed a decline of 10,200. Analysts expected an August increase of 10,000. EUR/NZD dropped 0.48% to 1.6397."

101,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2013 11:11PM ET</span>","Forex - USD/JPY higher after GDP, Olympics news","Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against the Japanese yen during Monday’s Asian after a bullish revision to Japan’s second-quarter GDP reading. In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY climbed 0.47% to 99.59 after earlier trading as high as 100.11. The greenback lost 0.47% against the yen last week. The pair is likely to find support at 98.26, the low of September 2 and resistance at 100.21, Friday’s high. Earlier Monday, data from the Cabinet Office showed Japan’s second-quarter GDP increased 3.8%, well above the prior estimate of growth of 2.6%. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic growth for the world’s third-largest economy. The strong GDP report could Prime Minister Shinzo Abe room to pursue a controversial sales tax increase. The government has cited revised GDP data as among key factors in deciding whether to go ahead with lifting the sales tax to 8% from 5% next April, and to 10% in October 2015, Reuters reported. A decision on the tax increase is expected next month. In a separate report, Ministry of Finance said that Japan’s current account balance was JPY330 billion last month compared with JPY650 billion in the prior month. Analysts expected an August reading of JPY320 billion. In other Japan news, the International Olympic Committee announced Saturday Tokyo beat out Istanbul and Madrid to host the 2020 Summer Games. It will be the fourth time Japan hosts the Olympics and the second time it has hosted the Summer Olympics. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY rose 0.54% to 91.59 while NZD/JPY added 0.15% to 79.49."

The most recent batch of economic data out of the world’s third-largest economy has been solid enough to indicate that Abenomics is working and working well enough that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe can push through his proposed consumption tax. Twenty-two of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect a large and negative impact on financial markets should the government postpone its plans of raising the sales tax from April next year, according to the news agency. While yen bears have become accustomed to easing and may have to live without additional stimulus measures for the near-term, observers of BoJ expect the central bank will roll out fresh easing measures in 2014 in effort to achieve Abe’s goal of 2% inflation within two years. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY fell 0.09% to 91.42 after the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that Australia’s trade balance fell to AUD-770 million last month from AUD240 million in July. The July reading was revised lower from AUD600 million. Analysts expected an August reading of AUD50 million. EUR/JPY dropped 0.13% to 131.56 while NZD/JPY fell 0.10% to 78.78."

In U.S. economic news out Wednesday, the Labor Department said producer prices were flat last month, indicating little in the way of inflationary pressures in the world’s largest economy. Core prices increased 0.1% last month, below the 0.2% increase analysts expected. Year-over-year, the produce price index was up 1.2%. While the yen remains the worst-performing developed market currency in the world this year, a scenario that benefits Japanese exporters and stocks, the currency has gained some strength recently prompting some traders to wonder if the Bank of Japan needs to add to its already massive stimulus program to further weaken the yen. Short positions against the yen in U.S. currency futures reached USD10.3 billion last week and the yen remains shorted by the highest amount in six years, according to the Financial Times. However, all that bearishness has not translated to recent downside for the Japanese currency. That could be a sign traders believe BoJ is out of ammunition and that the central can do little to further depress the yen. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY inched down 0.01% to 130.08 after data showed the euro zone's gross domestic product expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, outpacing market calls for quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.2%. France’s economy grew 0.5%, while Germany’s economy expanded by 0.7%. Germany and France are the region’s two largest economies. AUD/JPY rose 0.26% to 89.79."

The kiwi was plagued Monday by reports that New Zealand dairy exporter Fonterra found botulism bacteria in some of its products. New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser said on Sunday that China has halted all milk powder imports from New Zealand and Australia following the news. Russia also joined China in halting imports of New Zealand milk powder and other countries are expected to follow suit until the situation is resolved, Milk powder is one of New Zealand’s largest exports, accounting for 15% of the country’s GDP. The news comes at a tenuous time for the kiwi and the New Zealand economy because Chinese economic growth is slowing. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is one of New Zealand’s top export markets.

In Asian trading Tuesday, EUR/USD inched up 0.02% to 1.3261 after data showed that the euro zone’s services purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.8 in July, beating market calls for a 49.6 reading.Also in Europe, Eurostat, the statistical arm of the European Union, reported that retail sales fell 0.5% in June from May, slightly better than market forecasts for a 0.6% contraction though off a 1.1% gain the previous month. GBP/USD nudged up 0.03% to 1.5359 after the British Retail Consortium said retail sales in the U.K. rose 2.2% in July following a 1.4% increase in June. Analysts expected the July number to rise 2%. On Monday, Markit Economics said that the U.K. services purchasing managers' index rose to 60.2 from 56.9 in June, well above economists’ expectations for a reading of 57.2. USD/JPY fell 0.20% to 98.09, dragging Japanese stocks lower in the process.  USD/CHF fell 0.08% to 0.9268 while USD/CAD dropped 0.10% to 1.0352.

Australia’s benchmark interest rate is currently a record low of 2.75%. NZD/USD rose 0.23% to 0.7841 a day after the kiwi fell on news of milk powder contamination.

619,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2013 08:46PM ET</span>",Gold gains as dollar trades mostly lower,"Investing.com - Gold futures traded higher in the early part of Tuesday’s Asian session as traders boosted bullion amid weakness in the U.S. dollar. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery rose 0.23% to USD1,305.35 per troy ounce in Asian trading. The August contract settled lower by 0.78% at USD1,300.25 per ounce during Monday’s U.S. trade. Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,282.65 a troy ounce, Friday's low, and resistance at USD1,339.15, Wednesday's high. Another strong U.S. economic data point out Monday had investors moving out of gold, though it was a slack day for equities as well.  In U.S. economic news out Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its services index climbed to 56 in July from 52.2 in June. Economists expected a July reading of 53. The new orders index rose to 57.7 from 50.8, but the employment index fell to 53.2 from 54.7. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. The ISM report renewed expectations for the Federal Reserve to begin tapering its stimulus programs later this year, which weakened gold, though uncertainty curbed losses, especially in wake of a lackluster U.S. July jobs report released late last week. Although markets appear to be adjusting to the fact Fed tapering is a matter of ""when not if,"" lingering uncertainty over the actual start date of tapering could weigh on gold and other dollar-denominated commodities in the coming weeks. Elsewhere, Comex silver for September delivery inched down 0.04% to USD19.712 per ounce while copper for September delivery fell 0.14% to USD3.163. Bearish bets on copper have risen noticeably in recent days."

During U.S. morning trade, the dollar was higher against the euro, with EUR/USD retreating 0.56% to 1.3228.  The greenback strengthened broadly after the Institute of Supply Management said its purchasing managers index rose to 55.4 in July from a reading of 50.9 in June, expanding at the fastest rate since April 2011.Analysts had expected the index to rise to 52.0 last month.

Jobless claims for the preceding week were revised down to a gain of 345,000, from a previously reported 343,000.  Meanwhile, the euro came under pressure after ECB President Draghi said that the central bank’s monetary policy will remain accommodative “for an extended period of time”.The ECB held its benchmark interest rate at a record low 0.50% in August, in line with expectations.  Earlier in the day, Markit said the euro zone's manufacturing PMI rose to 50.3 in July, from a reading of 50.1 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to remain unchanged last month.  The greenback was also higher against the pound, with GBP/USD declining 0.33% to 1.5159.  The Bank of England left interest rates on hold at a record low 0.5% and kept the size of its asset purchase program unchanged at GBP375 billion, at Governor Mark Carney's first meeting at the head of the central bank.  Also Thursday, Markit said the U.K. manufacturing PMI rose to 54.6 last month, from a reading of 52.9 in June. Analysts had expected the index to tick down to 52.8 in July.

Following the ECB's monthly policy meeting, Mario Draghi also said that downside risks to growth in the single currency bloc remain, warranting a loose monetary policy.  The ECB left its benchmark interest rate on hold at a record low 0.5%.

792,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2013 10:07PM ET</span>",Forex - NZD/USD plunges after China PMI data,"Investing.com - The New Zealand dollar tumbled against its U.S. rival during Wednesday’s Asian session, reversing a positive start to the day after data showed manufacturing activity in China slowed for a third consecutive month. In Asian trading Wednesday, NZD/USD slid 0.40% to 0.7966. The pair was likely to find support at 0.7909, Monday's low and resistance at 0.8054, the high of June 19. The kiwi sagged after the flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 47.7 for July. Last month, the HSBC PMI fell to a nine-month low of 48.2. Readings below 50 indicate contraction. The July reading is an 11-month low. The HSBC reading comes a week before the official government data.  The employment index fell to 47.3 in July, the lowest level since March 2009. That index has been below 50 for four straight months. The new orders sub-index fell to its lowest level in 11 months, and stayed below 50 for a third straight month. Output declined to 10-month low and remained in contraction for a second month, according to Reuters. China posted second-quarter GDP growth of 7.5% and policymakers there have vowed not to let growth slip below 7% this year. Still, the second-quarter GDP reading was the ninth lower reading in the past 10 quarters. The kiwi started the day in fine fashion against the greenback after New Zealand reported a June trade surplus of NZD414 million, far better than the NZD100 million analysts expected. AUD/NZD fell 0.05% to 1.1619 after the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that consumer price inflation there was 0.4% in the second quarter. Analysts expected a reading of 0.5%. Australia’s trimmed mean CPI was 0.5% compared with 0.4% in the first quarter. The first-quarter reading was revised up from 0.3%. Analysts expected 0.5% for the second quarter. NZD/JPY inched down 0.05% to 79.50. Earlier Wednesday, data showed Japan’s trade balance was in deficit for a 12th consecutive month. Japanese exports rose 7.4% last month, but that was below the 10.3% increase analysts expected."

794,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2013 09:12PM ET</span>",Forex - Dollar mostly higher following Asian data points ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against most of its major rivals during Wednesday’s Asian session following the release of some key economic data in the region. In Asian trading Wednesday, EUR/USD inched down 0.04% to 1.3219 as traders await a series of euro zone indicators on manufacturing and service-sector activity due Wednesday, which may provide fresh steering currents for the market. USD/JPY rose 0.12% to 99.57 after data showed Japan’s trade balance was in deficit for a 12th consecutive month. Japanese exports rose 7.4% last month, but that was below the 10.3% increase analysts expected. However, the weak yen is also increasing the cost of energy imports to resource-starved Japan, leading to another trade deficit. Still, first-quarter data showed Japan was the fastest growing major economy in the world.  Exports to China rose 4.8% while exports to the U.S. surged 14.6% compared with 16.3% in May, according to the data. China and the U.S. are Japan’s two largest export markets.

835,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 21, 2013 09:38PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY lower despite election results,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against the Japanese yen to start the week in Asia despite news that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party scored, as expected an easy victory in the weekend’s elections that decided control of Japan’s upper house of parliament. In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY fell 0.46% to 100.15 after earlier trading as low as 99.62. The pair is likely to find support at 99.45, Thursday’s low and resistance at 101.52, the high of July 8. USD/JPY rose 0.18% last Friday and 0.66% for the week. While victory for Abe’s LDP was thought to be a potential boon for yen bears, it was also widely expected, indicating that markets may have efficiently priced in the result in the days leading up the election. Gaining control of the upper house of parliament could allow Abe to continue to push through a series of structural reforms aimed at spurring economic growth and fighting deflation. Media reports said Abe’s LDP and its partner, the New Komeito party, had won at least 74 of the 121 seats up for grabs in the 242-seat upper house, according to Reuters. It marks the first time since 2007 that Japan will operate without a split parliament. There are concerns that now with control of both houses of parliament that Abe will turn his attention to the more conservative side of his agenda, which includes possibly increasing Japan’s military capabilities, but many market participants believe it is unlikely the prime minister will suddenly shift course from making the economy his top priority. Japanese stocks appeared to like news of the LDP gaining control of the upper house. The Nikkei 225 was up 0.71% at this writing. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY fell 0.42% to 131.66 while AUD/JPY dropped 0.18% to 92.18."

989,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 10, 2013 09:33PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY lower ahead of BoJ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded lower against the Japanese yen during Thursday’s Asian session as traders await the conclusion of the Bank of Japan’s two-day policy meeting. In Asian trading Thursday, USD/JPY fell 0.29% to 99.42. The pair was likely to find resistance at 101.53, the high from July 7, and support at 99.30. Earlier Thursday, data showed Japan's core machinery orders rose 10.5% in May following an 8.8% decrease in April. The May reading easily topped economists’ expectations for a 1.3% increase. That data point could be a sign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to jolt the world’s third-largest economy are taking shape, perhaps indicating that USD/JPY trading higher Thursday is more the result of dollar weakness than yen strength. Dollar weakness is a believable scenario as the greenback traded lower against nearly all of its major rivals. After the close U.S. markets, Bernanke delivered comments that sent U.S. stock futures and commodities soaring while sending the U.S. Dollar Index plunging. In those remarks, Bernanke said the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy is needed over the near-term, quelling speculation that the central bank could begin tapering its USD85 billion-per-month easing program as soon as September. While data from the U.S. labor market, manufacturing sector, housing industry and other sectors of the economy have come in better than expected recently, Bernanke noted the U.S. unemployment rate of 7.6% may belie the job market’s actual strength, indicating that last week’s stronger-than-expected June jobs report did not factor into his comments. Regarding BoJ, most traders do not expect any alternations to the central bank’s own easing regime following this meeting, but that possibility has not been ruled out for later this year. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY rose 0.45% to 91.85 while NZD/JPY climbed 0.88% to 78.80."

In Asian trading Monday, EUR/USD fell 0.15% to 1.2852 European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said in comments before the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs committee that euro area economic activity should recover over the course of this year. Weakness in the euro could be a sign that traders are expecting some form of monetary easing from the ECB later this year. With Draghi pledging to keep interest rates low and expectations in place that the Federal Reserve will begin tapering its USD85 billion-per-month stimulus program, upside for the euro against the greenback could be limited in the near-term. USD/JPY inched up 0.04% to 101.04 after the Bank of Japan said that Japan’s M2 money supply rose by a seasonally adjusted 3.8% in June following a 3.5% increase in May. May’s figure was revised up from a 3.4% increase. Analysts expected a June increase of 3.4%. GBP/USD dropped 0.18% to 1.4927 after rebounding from near four-month lows on Monday. In a report, Capital Economics said the U.K. economy could be in store for a period of ""catch up"" growth. In another report, BDO said U.K. business confidence and output both jumped to 13-month highs in June. Later Tuesday, the U.K. delivers May industrial output data with analysts expecting an increase of 0.2% following a 0.1% rise in April. USD/CHF rose 0.16% to 0.9653 while USD/CAD added 0.09% to 1.0571 as oil prices drifted lower. Investors kept an eye out towards the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting on Wednesday, hoping to gain further insight on the direction of U.S. monetary policy. The Australian dollar remains under siege against the greenback as AUD/USD fell 0.25% to 0.9112. NZD/USD dropped 0.20% to 0.7786 while the U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.13% to 84.55."

Draghi was expected to reiterate that monetary policy will remain accommodative for the foreseeable future.The dollar was lower against the safe haven yen, with USD/JPY slipping 0.07% to 99.82 and pushed higher against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF up 0.30% to 0.9491. The greenback was mixed against its Australian, New Zealand and Canadian counterparts, with AUD/USD rising 0.37% to 0.9118, NZD/USD climbing 0.22% to 0.7795 and USD/CAD gaining 0.39% to trade at 1.0544.The Australian dollar was boosted after the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said comments by Governor Glenn Stevens on Wednesday about the bank’s July policy meeting had been misinterpreted by markets.Stevens said the board ""deliberated for a very long time"" before deciding to keep rates on hold, fuelling speculation that the bank considered a further rate cut.The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.34% to 83.68. Trade volumes were expected to remain light on Thursday, with markets in the U.S. closed for the Independence Day holiday.

1219,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2013 09:58PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY up as Fed action seen boosting dollar ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against the Japanese yen Tuesday in Asia as traders continue to expect the end of U.S. monetary easing will boost the greenback against its major rivals. In Asian trading Tuesday, USD/JPY rose 0.24% to 97.98 after earlier trading as high as 98.08. The pair is likely to find support at 96.85, Friday’s low and resistance at 99.45, the high of June 6. In U.S. economic news out Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said late last week that its manufacturing index rose to 12.5 in June from -5.2 in May, well above expectations for a -2.0 reading.A separate report showed that U.S. existing home sales climbed 4.2% to 5.18 million units in May from April’s total of 4.97 million, far surpassing market calls for a 0.6% increase. Solid data points such as those stoke speculation that the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, is improving at such a clip that the Fed can start trimming its USD85 billion-a-month bond-buying activities in the near-term. Traders widely expect the Fed to cease easing in 2014. Earlier Tuesday, the Bank Of Japan said that Japan’s corporate services price index rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.3% last month following a -0.3% reading in April. Analysts had expected Japan’s CSPI to rise to 0.1% last month. The April reading was revised up from -0.4%. USD/JPY got a lift Monday after BoJ Deputy Governor Kikuo Iwata said the central bank can still deploy easing measures if it has to. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY rose 0.26% to 128.57 while AUD/JPY added 0.37% to 90.74. NZD/JPY advanced 0.33% to 76.04."

In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY rose 0.48% to 98.33. Earlier in the session, USD/JPY traded at 98.51, the highest level in two weeks. The pair is likely to find support at 96.85, Friday’s low and resistance at 99.45, the high of June 6. The greenback got a bid against the yen Monday after Japan’s ruling political party raced to easy victory in Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly elections on Sunday. While the result was widely expected, it could serve as a sign that the country’s ruling party could take control of the upper house of parliament in elections due to be held next month. Sunday’s results could also be a sign that many Japanese citizens are warming to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to boost the world’s third-largest economy. Last week, the greenback surged 3.82% against the yen, the best weekly performance since December 2009, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday that the bank could begin slowing its USD85 billion-a-month bond purchasing program by the end of 2013 and wind it down completely by the middle of 2014 if the economy picks up as the central bank expects.The yen was weaker against nearly all of the major currencies, helping Japanese equities climb Monday. Some analysts expect that if USD/JPY can stay above the 95 level, more Japanese exporters will boost profit guidance. In turn, that could benefit Japanese equities which are already among Asia’s top performers this year. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY rose 0.24% to 128.75 while AUD/JPY added 0.49% to 90.64. NZD/JPY climbed 0.60% to 76.20."
1241,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 23, 2013 09:10PM ET</span>","Forex - Dollar mostly higher, but down against some riskier fare","Investing.com - The U.S. dollar traded higher against most of its major rivals during Monday’s Asian session, but the greenback did come under some pressure against some of the higher-beta currencies as traders perhaps did some dip-buying in those pairs. In Asian trading Monday, EUR/USD fell 0.12% to 1.3110. Last Friday, Greece’s Democratic Left party withdrew from the coalition government in protest over its decision to shut down the state broadcaster, leaving the government with only a slim majority in parliament However, the International Monetary Fund said it would not suspend Greek funding and said Athens has until July to come up with an agreement on its bailout program. The week ahead is chock full of important euro zone data points that could increase euro volatility. USD/JPY jumped 0.44% to 98.29 after Japan’s ruling political party raced to easy victory in Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly elections on Sunday. Earlier in the session, USD/JPY traded at 98.51, the highest level in two weeks. Last week, the greenback surged 3.82% against the yen, the best weekly performance since December 2009. GBP/USD fell 0.20% to 1.5392. Last week, Bank of England meeting minutes revealed some members of the central bank favor further quantitative easing. The BoE said recent economic data has been largely positive and was consistent with the slow but sustained recovery outlined in the bank’s quarterly forecasts in May. USD/CHF added 0.18% to 0.9364 while USD/CAD rose 0.21% to 1.0485 as oil prices were steady. AUD/USD inched up 0.08% to 0.9225 after the Aussie touched a 33-month low against the greenback last week. Many analysts and traders expect the Aussie to keep falling due to declining commodities demand and slack Chinese economic data. NZD/USD added 0.26% to 0.7764. The kiwi is also expected to continue falling as investors favor the safer greenback due to improving U.S. economic data. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.18% to 82.76."

1259,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 21, 2013 03:10AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY higher on Fed statement ,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen on Friday, as demand for the greenback remained supported by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments on Wednesday.  USD/JPY hit 97.89 during early European trade, the session high; the pair subsequently consolidated at 97.73, climbing 0.49%.  The pair was likely to find support at 96.20, Thursday's low and resistance at 98.98, the high of June 11.  The dollar gained ground after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday said the bank could begin slowing asset purchases by the end of 2013 and wind them down completely by the middle of 2014 if the economy picks up as the central bank expects.  However, a string of mixed U.S. economic reports on Thursday fuelled uncertainty over the strength of the country's economic recovery.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index rose to 12.5 in June from minus 5.2 in May, outstripping expectations for a reading of minus 2.0 and rising at the fastest pace since April 2011.  The data came after the Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week rose by 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 354,000, a three-week high, compared to expectations for an increase of 4,000 to 340,000.  Elsewhere, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said financial markets will likely stabilise over time, reflecting improvements in Japan's economy. Kuroda also warned that uncertainty surrounding the world's third-largest economy remains high, and that the central bank will carefully watch market developments.  The yen was lower against the euro with EUR/JPY advancing 0.60%, to hit 129.34.  Trading volumes were expected to remain light, as no U.S. data was scheduled to be released throughout the day."

1325,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2013 09:58PM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD falls after RBA minutes ,"Investing.com - After starting Tuesday’s Asian session in fine form, the Australian dollar fell against its U.S. counterpart following the release of minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s most recent meeting. In Asian trading Tuesday, AUD/USD fell 0.17% to 0.9527 after earlier trading as high as 0.9574. The pair was likely to find support at 0.9430, the low of June 13 and resistance at 0.9760, the high of June 4. In a news release, RBA said, Australia’s inflation outlook may provide room for further easing. RBA held interest rates at 2.75% following its June 4 meeting, but that is a record low and the bank has shown a penchant for rate cuts dating back to 2011. Monetary easing could be necessary down the road because, while steady, Australia’s GDP has been slightly below trend for four consecutive quarters. ""In China, economic activity appeared to be expanding at a steady pace, driven by strong investment growth, with both infrastructure and real estate investment continuing to grow strongly. Conditions in the residential property market remained buoyant in April, although members observed that recently announced controls could weigh on activity in coming months, depending on how widely and strictly they were enforced,"" RBA said in the statement. However, in data released earlier Tuesday, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said new home prices there rose 6% in May. That could significantly limit the chances of an interest rate cut in China, which is trying to fight off a property bubble. China is Australia’s largest trading partner. ""At this meeting, members viewed the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate for the time being. The Board also judged that the inflation outlook as currently assessed might provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to support demand,"" said RBA. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY inched down 0.07% to 90.17 while AUD/NZD fell 0.3% to 1.1929."

1346,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 16, 2013 10:43PM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY higher after tertiary industry data,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen during Monday’s Asian session following the release of tertiary industry data. In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY rose 0.44% to 94.60 after earlier trading as high as 94.78 and as low as 94.12. Last week, the pair ended the week 3.8% lower, the largest weekly decline since July 2009.The pair is likely to find support at 92.72, the low of April 4 and resistance at 96.09, Thursday’s high.The yen rose to multi-month highs against the dollar and the euro earlier the week, following steep falls in Japanese equities after the Bank of Japan disappointed market expectations for measures to ease market volatility.The BoJ’s lack of action, along with growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin to taper its USD85 billion-a-month bond purchasing program, sparked a broad sell-off in risk assets. In U.S. economic news out last Friday, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading for the June consumer sentiment index fell to 82.7 from 84.5 in May. Economists expected a June reading of 84.5, which was an almost six-year high when reported last month. That data point sent USD/JPY down 1.26% to close the week. Earlier Monday, METI said that Japanese tertiary industry activity index remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 0.0% in May after falling 1.3% in April. Analysts had expected Japanese tertiary industry activity index to rise 0.2% last month.  Elsewhere, AUD/JPY surged 0.76% to 90.85 after the Australian Bureau of Statistics said new vehicle sales there inched up to a seasonally adjusted 93,209 in May, from 93,182 in April. On a year-over-year basis, the increase was a modest 0.2%. Meanwhile, NZD/JPY jumped 0.83% to 76.39 while EUR/JPY rose 0.36% to 126.14."
1347,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 16, 2013 10:24PM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD up despite flat auto sales data,"Investing.com - The Australian dollar continued to regain some lost ground against its U.S. rival during Monday’s Asian session even after tepid new motor vehicles sales data released earlier in the session. In Asian trading Monday, AUD/USD rose 0.37% to 0.9610 after earlier trading as high as 0.9622. Last week, the Aussie rose 1.56% against the greenback, posting its first weekly advance in six weeks against the U.S. currency. The pair is likely to find support at 0.9324, the low from June 11 and a 33-month low and resistance at 0.9665, Thursday’s session high.  Earlier Monday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said new vehicle sales there inched up to a seasonally adjusted 93,209 in May, from 93,182 in April. On a year-over-year basis, the increase was a modest 0.2%. Passenger vehicle sales fell 1.2% while sales of sports utility vehicles fell 0.1%. Sales of other vehicles, including trucks, rose 3.5%. Data released last Thursday showed that the number of employed people in Australia rose by 1,100 in May, beating expectations for a 10,000 decline , after a 45,000 increase the previous month. The report also showed that Australia's unemployment rate ticked down to 5.5% last month, from 5.6% in April. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged in May. Despite the recent weakness in the Aussie, some analysts are sticking by year bullish year-end forecasts for Australian stocks. Fore example, UBS and Macquarie see the ASX/S&P 200 gaining about 10% from current levels. Other media reports noted that a weaker Aussie could eventually benefit the economy there because the country’s services industry, including tourism-related sub-industries, represents almost 70% of total GDP. Elsewhere, AUD/JPY surged 0.79% to 90.88 while EUR/AUD fell 0.46% to 1.3877. AUD/NZD dropped 0.13% to 1.1891."

In Asian trading Thursday, NZD/USD dropped 0.95% to 0.7908. The pair was likely to find support at 0.7836, the low of June 10 and resistance at 0.8016, the high of June 7. Earlier Thursday, RBNZ opted to keep interest rates at a record low of 2.5% while reiterating its commitment to keep rates low through the end of this year. RBNZ has been steadfast in its commitment to not alter rates this year and some traders expect the central bank will raise rates early in 2014. In a statement, RBNZ continued to express concern about a possible housing bubble in New Zealand. ""Given this outlook, we expect to keep the OCR (official cash rate) unchanged through the end of the year,"" Governor Graeme Wheeler said in the release. On a more cheery note, the central bank said rebuilding efforts in Canterbury will help boost the country’s GDP growth to 3.5% in the back half of next year, which is slightly above RBNZ’s previous estimate. Wheeler added that RBNZ will again intervene in the currency market should the kiwi begin rising again. In a note published earlier Thursday, TDSecurities reiterated its year-end target for NZD/USD of 0.8300. On Wednesday in New Zealand, industrial data showed that house price inflation rose 0.7% in May, after a 0.8% increase the previous month. Elsewhere, NZD/JPY plunged 2.15% to 74.99 while AUD/NZD climbed 0.54% to 1.1937."

1452,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 09, 2013 09:24PM ET</span>",Forex - AUD/USD drilled by Chinese data,"Investing.com - The Australian dollar continued sliding against its U.S. rival during Monday’s Asian session as concerning Chinese data points pressured the Aussie. In Asian trading Monday, AUD/USD tumbled 0.44% to 0.9451. The pair was likely to find support at 0.9396, today’s low, and resistance at 0.9760, Tuesday’s high. The Aussie’s move below 94 cents against the greenback was its first in 20 months. Data out of China, Australia’s largest export partner, was the culprit. After a crackdown by Chinese officials on manipulators that use currency conversions to boost export data, Chinese exports showed an increase of just 1% last month. Exports to the U.S. and European Union, China’s two largest export markets, declined for a third consecutive month. Imports fell 0.3%, well below the expected 6% increase. China's consumer inflation dropped to 2.1%, below the expected reading of 2.5%, while producer prices fell 2.9%. Analysts expected PPI to drop 2.5%. Retail sales rose 12.9%, which met expectations. Fixed-asset investment and industrial production also met analysts’ expectations with year-over-year gains of 20.4% and 9.2%. China’s M2 money supply rose 15.8%, but that was below the expected 15.9% increase. New loans totaled 667.4 million yuan, but that missed expectations of 850 billion yuan and down from April's 792.9 billion yuan. Australian markets are closed today in observance of the Queen's Birthday public holiday. Elsewhere, AUD/NZD fell 0.23% to 1.2023 though NZD/USD fell because like Australia, New Zealand counts China as its biggest export partner. AUD/JPY rose 0.10% to 92.68 after Japan revised its first-quarter GDP reading to show growth of 4.1%. The initial reading was 3.5% growth. In a separate report, the Ministry of Finance said that Japan’s current account balance rose to a seasonally adjusted JPY850 billion from JPY340 billion in April. Analysts expected an increase to JPY390 billion."

In Asian trading Thursday, EUR/USD was flat at 1.3094. The European Central Bank meets later Thursday. On Wednesday, data revealed the euro zone's service-sector purchasing managers’ index fell to 47.2 in May, missing expectations for a 47.5 reading. That could be the impetus for the ECB to continue a possible push toward negative interest rates.  GBP/USD 0.10% to 1.5393 ahead of what will be Bank of England Governor Mervyn King’s last meeting at the helm of the central bank. Traders believe King will not likely convince BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee to restart its quantitative easing activities. USD/JPY rose 0.21% to 99.28 a day after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said unveiled his so-called ""third arrow"" to restore Japan’s economy prominence. Abe is looking to bolster Japanese personal incomes to shore up a domestic economy now seen as vulnerable because of the rapid fall in the yen.

In U.S. economic news out Wednesday, the ADP private payroll survey showed non-government U.S. employers added 135,000 new jobs last month.

The Institute for Supply Management said its May services index rose to 53.7% from 53.1% in April. Economists expected a May reading of 54%. Readings above 50% indicate expansion.

In Asian trading Monday, AUD/USD rose 0.39% to 0.9615. The pair is likely to find support at 0.9527, Wednesday’s low and a 19-month low and resistance at 0.9684, Friday’s session high. Earlier in the session, AUD/USD traded as high as 0.9636, but traders took profits in the pair after China's unofficial HSBC manufacturing PMI report fell to 49.2 in May from 50.4 in April. Over the weekend, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said the country’s official PMI for May rose to 50.8 from 50.6 in April. That topped the 50.1 reading economists expected. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. ""Despite operating conditions worsening, manufacturing output rose for the seventh month in a row during May, albeit marginally. Behind the meagre expansion of output, total new orders declined modestly and for the first time since last September. Demand from abroad also weakened over the month, with new export orders falling for the second month in a row. A number of panellists suggested reduced client demand, particularly in the US, had led to the overall reduction in export orders,"" according to a statement by Markit. Both total new orders and export orders decreased last month. China is Australia’s largest export market. The report also weighed on the New Zealand dollar as AUD/NZD rose 0.24% to 1.2082.

Excluding food and energy expenditures, consumer spending was flat last month.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading of May consumer sentiment jumped to to 84.5 from 76.4 in April. That was the best reading since April 2007 and beat economists’ expectations for a reading of 83.7. Chicago PMI surged to 58.7 in May from 49 in April, easily topping economists’ expectations for a reading of 50. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.

NZD/USD rose 0.32% to 0.7974 after the kiwi fell to its lowest levels against the greenback since early September. The U.S. Dollar Index was steady at 83.31."

A report published earlier Wednesday showed Japan’s retail sales fell 0.1% last month on a year-over-year basis. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it was the fourth straight month of declines, though the pace of declines is slowing. Economists expected a decline of 0.4%. Sales from large retailers fell 2.3%, missing expectations that called for a 1% drop. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, Japan’s retail sales rose 0.7%. That topped forecasts that called for a 0.2% increase. Commercial and wholesale sales both fell 0.2%. Elsewhere, Koichi Hamada, an economic adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, threw some sharp rhetoric at South Korea. Hamada said South Korea should adjust its own monetary policy if it is concerned about the weak yen. South Korea, an export rival to Japan, has been among the most vocal critics of Japan’s weak yen policy. Earlier this month, the Bank of Korea lowered interest rates to 2.5% in an effort to weaken the won against the yen. Hamada is viewed as one of the architects of Abenomics, the prime minister’s efforts to weaken the yen and engineer inflation in the world’s third-largest economy.

Asmussen said keeping ""rates low for too long would create new risks."" Denmark has experimented with negative interest rates, something that has worked out well for the country’s equity market.

In Asian trading Monday, USD/JPY fell 0.21% to 101.08. The pair is likely to find support at 100.53, the low of May 10 and resistance at 102.57, Friday’s high. The BoJ minutes show members are concerned about the rise in bond yields caused by the central bank’s ultra-loose monetary stimulus efforts. Former economists Takahide Kiuchi and Takehiro Sato were among the members that expressed concern that targeting 2% inflation within two years was too much of a burden for an economy wracked by deflation dating back to at least the late 1990s. In late April BoJ voted to continue with its quantitative easing program approved early in the month that will see the central bank double its Japanese government bond holdings.  Over the weekend, BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda looked to assuage skittish financial markets by saying Japanese financial institutions can endure a rise in JGB bond yields and that markets there have not become excessively bullish. Still, some market participants are growing concerned about the ability of BoJ to tame bond yields and those concerns have been reflected by recent volatility in Japanese stocks, Asia’s top performers this year. Last Thursday, Japanese stocks suffered their worst one-day performance in over two years and the Nikkei 225 is down more than 2.5% Monday at this writing. Despite the yen’s recent strength against the greenback, data from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission indicate traders boosted their short bets on the yen for the week ending May 21. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY fell 0.33% to 130.59 while AUD/JPY dropped 0.48% to 97.31."
