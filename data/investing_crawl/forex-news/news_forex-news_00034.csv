 NEW DELHI/PATNA, India, June 14 (Reuters) - India's headline
inflation unexpectedly accelerated in May, heightening
expectations the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would raise rates
before its scheduled July review despite concerns over Europe's
debt crisis.
 The data came along with a sharp upward revision of March's
reading and on the heels of April manufacturing output matching
its fastest pace in 15 years, indicating strong growth and
rising inflationary pressures in Asia's third-largest economy.
 Separately, the finance ministry's chief economic adviser,
Kaushik Basu, said the strong growth in manufacturing would
continue and forecast the economy to grow 8.9 percent in the
June quarter, topping the previous quarter's 8.6 percent
expansion.
 ""This (inflation) increases the likelihood of an
inter-meeting rate hike from the RBI as inflationary pressures
are really showing up,"" said Sebastien Barbe, Hong Kong-based
head of emerging markets research and strategy at Credit
Agricole.
 ""It seems like the markets are also now less worried about
the situation in Europe, so the RBI may be less reluctant to
tighten before July.""

Bond yields and overnight swaps rose on the data, while
stocks trimmed gains. Most analysts had earlier said the RBI
would wait until its July 27 review to raise interest rates,
seeing its hands stayed by Europe's woes and and on liquidity
tightness. [ID:nBMA007807]
 That view is now changing.
 ""RBI will increase the frequency of its baby steps and we
expect some tightening measures in June itself and a repetition
of those in the July policy,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief
economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai.
 ""Baby steps"" to normalise monetary policy is what the RBI
has said is its preferred choice of action, but it has also kept
open the option of a rate hike ahead of the July review to
combat inflation which it deems ""worrisome.""
 K.C. Chakraborty, a central bank deputy governor, said there
was a ""fifty-fifty"" chance of a hike before the review, while
Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee indicated he did not favour a
near-term hike and said price pressures would ease in mid-July.
 ""There will be inflationary pressures till middle of July
but at this point of time I am not thinking of altering interest
rates,"" Mukherjee told reporters in the city of Patna on Monday.
 The wholesale price index (WPI) rose an annual 10.16 percent
in May, higher than the median forecast for 9.56 percent in a
Reuters' poll and April's 9.59 percent.
 In a sign the May reading could be an underestimate, March
inflation was revised to 11.04 percent from the earlier estimate
of 9.90 percent. Recent WPI data have been similarly revised up.
 India's economy grew at 7.4 percent in the year to end-March
2010 and is seen expanding at 8.5 percent in the current fiscal
year that began on April 1.
 REFORMS MORE DIFFICULT
 Persistently high inflation, which has been over the central
bank's perceived comfort level of 5 percent for seven months
running, could turn voters against the ruling Congress party
before eight state elections scheduled in 2010 and 2011.
 It would also dampen enthusiasm for reforms, such as a
keenly awaited freeing up of retail fuel prices, crucial to
improving public finances and stop state-run fuel retailers from
bleeding.
 The government deferred last week taking a decision on
freeing fuel prices, worried about political opposition and the
impact on prices.
 For a Q+A on the impact of a delay in fuel price reforms,
see [ID:nSGE65D04O]
 Policymakers have repeatedly said inflation would ease on
better prospects for crops from good monsoon rains. But a hike
in fuel prices could push it up, an adviser has
said.[ID:nBMA007779]
 On Monday, Basu said the impact would be limited.
 ""The inflation figure you are getting is going to go up,"" he
said. ""But if you go six months down the road ... in my opinion
you would see a smaller inflation then.""
 The benchmark 10-year bond yield , which had
risen 6 basis points after the WPI data, ticked up another point
to go past a five-week high of 7.68 percent.
 ""The hawkish comments by Basu led to a further sell off in
an already nervous market,"" said Bekxy Kuriakose, head of fixed
income at L&T Investment Management.
 One-year indexed swap rates  rose 6 basis
points. The swap rate has risen over 50 basis points from a
more-than 5-month low of 4.71 percent in early May on concerns
over tight liquidity and expectations of higher policy rates. 
Basu and Finance Secretary Ashok Chawla said the high WPI
readings were a matter of concern, but inflation would soften in
the months to come on cooling food prices.
 Chawla forecast WPI to fall to 5-6 percent by December, with
Basu adding it would be below 5 percent by end-March 2011.

 * Nervousness on money markets not as bad as post-Lehman
 * Not bothered by recent euro moves 
 
 (Adds details, by-line, combines stories)
 By Boris Groendahl
 VIENNA, June 14 (Reuters) - There is no need for action to
stabilise the euro and no danger of money markets becoming as
stressed as they were after the collapse of U.S. bank Lehman
Brothers in 2008, European Central Bank Governing Council member
Ewald Nowotny said on Monday.
 The ECB has abandoned its resistance to buying government
bonds as concerns over euro zone debt worsened in recent weeks
and Nowotny said baldly this was to prevent the sovereign debt
problems triggering another banking and economic crisis.
 Euro zone central banks have bought more than 40 billion
worth of government bonds in the latest round of steps to fight
the crisis, although Nowotny said this was relatively small
compared to the ECB's overall provision of liquidity.

 The ECB will also lend banks all the three-month funds they
need until at least September, but key interbank rates are
increasing steadily despite the promise of flush funding until
the end of the year.  [ID:nECB001223]
 ""We have overcome the banking crisis and we have overcome
the crisis of the real economy as growth rates are now positive
again,"" Nowotny said at a news conference in Vienna. ""What we
have now is a crisis of public finances.""
 ""The challenge is to avoid that this crisis again causes a
banking and financial crisis and this turns into a vicious
cycle,"" he said in the news conference, presenting the Austrian
central bank's economic outlook. [ID:nLDE65D0JM]
 ""The measures of the European Union and the European Central
Bank must be interpreted as measures to prevent the crisis
developing further,"" he said.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has always underlined that
the bond buys are only a temporary measure to ease
disfunctioning bond markets.
 Banks are depositing record amounts of cash at the ECB
overnight, but Nowotny and Irish counterpart Patrick Honohan
said tensions should not be exaggerated.
""We see -- it would be an illusion to lie about this -- that
there is a certain nervousness"" on money markets, Nowotny said.
 ""It's exactly for this reason that we have taken stabilising
measures, and I think these will have an effect. I therefore see
no reason why we would go back to a situation similar to after
the collapse of Lehman.""
 Honohan told a conference in Dublin there had been an
""overblown response to perceived fiscal risks"" recently but EU
measures aimed to tackle this. [ID:nLDE65D0IB]

 NO EURO WORRIES
 As money market rates have risen, the euro has fallen and is
down about 17 percent on a trade-weighted basis in the last six
months.  
 But Nowotny saw no need for any action to stabilise the
single currency, saying recent trends were no problem and it was
a relief not to have to worry about a strong euro crimping
exports.
 ""Of course we at the ECB have always said that we are
against sharp, strong moves, that means moves which cannot be
explained by economic fundamentals,"" he said.
 ""But I would not exaggerate that. We do not welcome it, but
we do not see any reason to introduce special measures.""
 Nowotny said that proposals for banking regulation discussed
at the Basel Committee and the G20 had to promote providing
straight credit to the economy but punish speculative business
like banks' proprietary trading.
 ""Banks have an important role for the broader economy, but
this role is simply to provide credit,"" he said. ""Proprietary
trading is not a key task they have for the broader economy and
it is therefore right to curb such activities.""
 Rules drawn up by the Basel Committee include higher capital
requirements for banks' assets held for trading, and Nowotny
said he hoped those proposals would survive pressure from the
banking lobby.
 He added that another key regulatory goal was to move
instruments like credit default swaps to orderly exchanges to
raise the transparency of pricing and volumes, rather than have
them traded only over-the-counter as they are now.
 He said he sympathised with the German government's
unilateral move to ban naked CDS trading.
 ""Of course it would be better if such measures are
internationally coordinated, but you've got to say realistically
that decision making in the EU and the G20 is slow,"" he said.

 By Neal Armstrong 
 LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday as an
improvement in sentiment towards riskier assets hit the dollar
and prompted a bout of short-covering in the single European
currency, lifting it further away from a recent four-year low.
 But analysts said the recovery in the euro was unlikely to
push it out of its downtrend, as the structural problems in the
euro zone which have plagued the currency had not altered.
 ""We've seen a good session for equities. This looks to be a
pro-risk move, driven by the higher-yielding currencies such as
the Aussie. Fundamentally, nothing has changed for the euro,""
said Kenneth Broux, market economist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 At 0940GMT, the euro was up around 1 percent versus the
dollar at $1.2245, just off best levels of the day. European
equities were up 1 percent.
 Traders said hedge funds had been seen cutting short
positions on a break of $1.2150/60 in Asia and then through
$1.2220 in Europe.
 Technical analysts were looking for a close above the 21-day
moving average at $1.2234 for the first time since mid-April.
Additional resistance levels were highlighted at $1.2330 and
$1.2445, the 2008 and 2009 lows.
 The euro has lost 15 percent against the dollar this year
but gained 1.6 percent last week as it pulled up from a
four-year low at $1.1876.
 European Union leaders meet on Thursday and are expected to
make a new attempt to convince markets they can contain debt
problems by agreeing how to tighten economic policy coordination
and strengthen budget discipline.
 
 EURO SHORTS BOOSTED
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed speculators
boosted their bets against the euro in the week ended June 8,
although net short positions were below record levels.
 ""The positioning is not extreme but there is room for a
rebound in the euro from here. Our one-month forecast is for a
move to $1.25 but after that we expect it to go down,"" said
Derek Halpenny, European head of currency research at BTM-UFJ.
 The Australian dollar gained around 1 percent versus the
dollar to trade above $0.8600, its highest in a month.
 The Aussie also gained more than a percent on the
low-yielding yen, which was soft across the board, to 78.99 yen
, touching its highest in nearly four weeks.
 The euro rose 1.4 percent to trade above 112 yen for the
first time in a week. The rise in the yen crosses allowed the
dollar to make a brief show above 92 yen.
 The dollar was down over 1 percent versus a currency basket
at 86.522. Analysts said the greenback could be undermined by
U.S. President Barack Obama and his aides calling for more
stimulus to support the economy.
 ""With the market focusing on public finances, this
politically motivated move could put the dollar under pressure
going forward,"" said Broux at Lloyds.
 A top White House adviser said on Sunday the administration
wanted to speed up job creation.
 Sterling was given a boost as the UK's newly created Office
for Budget responsibility said it expected government borrowing
to fall slightly faster than originally thought. The pound
was up 1.3 percent versus the dollar at $1.4740 and outpaced the
euro slightly to trade at 83.08 pence.

lower debt ratios on the back of strong economic growth and
robust cash flows from telecom auctions.
 The agency affirmed India's BBB-minus local and foreign
currency rating and the stable outlook on its foreign currency

position.
 ""Public finances remain a clear weakness, and downward

 Fitch forecast a decline in India's government debt to GDP

 It also upgraded India's growth forecast to 8.5 percent from

 Fitch warned of a possible downgrade if the country's growth

 The agency is also wary of price pressures and said

 * Ruling party will mention sales tax in manifesto
 * Govt aims to unveil fiscal reform plans before G20 summit
(Adds details)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, June 14 (Reuters) - Japan will set a goal of bringing
its primary budget balance into the black within a decade in a
fiscal reform strategy to be unveiled this month, Prime Minister
Naoto Kan said, as part of efforts to rein its huge public debt.
 Kan, who took up his post after his unpopular predecessor
quit abruptly this month, also repeated his pledge to keep fresh
government bond issuance at or below this fiscal year's record
44.3 trillion yen ($483 billion) in the year from next April.
 The plans spelled out by Kan are roughly in line with what
financial market players say is needed for Japan to avoid a
credit ratings downgrade.
 ""We aim to include it in our fiscal goals,"" Kan told the
lower house of parliament on Monday, referring to the target for
the primary balance.
 The primary balance, or the budget balance excluding revenue
from bond sales and debt servicing costs, is in deficit by 33.5
trillion yen this fiscal year, or about 7 percent of GDP.
 The government, faced with the task of reining in public debt
that is nearly twice the size of GDP, plans to lay out medium-
and long-term fiscal targets before a G20 summit in Toronto next
week.
 Rating agencies have warned that Japan's sovereign debt
rating could be cut unless Tokyo crafts a credible plan to fix
the country's tattered finances.
 There is no concern about Japan's ability to fund its
deficits in the near term because of the country's vast pool of
domestic savings.
 But fears that this could change in the long term as the
ageing population starts drawing on savings have raised demands
for protection of Japanese government bonds in the credit default
swaps market.
 Kan, a fiscal conservative, has warned that Japan risks
defaulting on its borrowing if it fails to rein in its massive
public debt, and stressed that fixing the country's finances is
the biggest issue the government needs to tackle.
 He said on Monday the primary balance target and bond
issuance cap may not be enough.
 ""Even if we keep government debt issuance at 44.3 trillion
yen, outstanding public debt will exceed 200 percent of GDP if
such a level of debt issuance continues for three years,"" Kan
said. ""We are fully aware of the need to meet the target.""
 Fiscal conservatives in the ruling Democratic Party want the
party's manifesto for an upper house election expected in July to
include a reference to raising the politically sensitive sales
tax after the next general election for the more powerful lower
house, due by late 2013.
 ""There will be some reference to the sales tax in the
manifesto,"" Kan said, adding that the government will soon
indicate its intentions regarding overhauling that and other
taxes.
 Kan also said the government will work closely with the Bank
of Japan to beat deflation, which he described as an urgent
policy task.

 * World stocks lifted by economic hopes, recovery from lows
 * Euro rises for 5th straight session
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - World stocks headed for a fourth
straight day of gains on Monday as investors banked on global
economic recovery to trump concerns such as euro zone sovereign
debt in providing a positive backdrop for corporate earnings.
 The euro also followed up its best week this year against
the dollar to rise around half a percent.
 Although it has been extremely volatile, investors have
launched a tentative rally since late May, lifting world stocks
by about 6 percent from their lows and half embracing riskier
assets.
 MSCI's main emerging market stock index, for example, has
gained more than 9 percent since hitting a year low on May 25.
It was up 1.1 percent on Monday.
 Part of the rally is due to the year's sell off -- world
stocks are down 6 percent year to day and 8.2 percent for the
second quarter. But it is also the result of a belief among many
investors that the underlying economic backdrop is relatively
positive.
 China, in particular, is seen as pulling world recovery
forward, with the United States following.
 ""What is helping the market is the notion that a double dip
recession is not a big risk,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment
strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. ""I think that is what
the markets are latching onto.""
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.6 percent, driven
by banking, mining and commodity stocks, all of which tend to
gain when economic sentiment is on the plus side.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.8 percent, driven higher
by exporters, again a group with a high correlation to economic
growth.
 
 EURO REBOUND
 Improved attitudes towards riskier assets also lifted the
euro, hitting the dollar, in part because it prompted hedge
funds to cover their short positions on the European currency.
 The euro was trading with gains of around 0.6 percent versus
the dollar at $1.2180 having traded as high as $1.2208 on
trading platform EBS.
 It has risen as much as 2.4 percent over the past five
trading sessions, but is still down around 15 percent year to
date.
 Overall, however, the negative sentiment about the euro,
prompted by fears for euro zone debt and the economic cost of
cutting it, remained.
 ""We've seen a good session for equities overnight. This
looks to be a pro-risk move, driven by the higher-yielding
currencies such as the Aussie. Fundamentally, nothing has
changed for the euro,"" said Kenneth Broux, market economist at
Lloyds Banking Group.
 On euro zone bond markets, the two-year Schatz yield
climbed 1.4 basis points to 0.48 percent, while the 10-year
Bund yielded 2.602 percent, up 3.4 basis points as benchmark
bond prices dropped, reflecting stronger appetite for riskier
investments.

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed speculators

 With the market still very short euros, Sue Trinh, a senior
FX strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, did not rule
out a push up as far as $1.24-$1.25 within its downtrend.
 ""If the moves continue then we could start running into
systematic-type stops for the likes of euro/dollar and the DXY
(dollar) more generally,"" she said.
 The Australian dollar topped $0.8560, its highest in a
month. Resistance was seen at $0.8570-80, stemming from a low in
February and a 38.2 percent retracement of its April-May drop.
 The Aussie also gained 0.6 percent on the low-yielding yen,
which was soft across the board, to 78.70 yen, touching its
highest in nearly four weeks.
 The euro rose around 1 percent to trade above 112 yen for
the first time in a week. The rise in the yen crosses allowed

 by Mantik Kusjanto
 WELLINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank
chief warned on Monday that the country needed to cut its high
debt or face punishment by markets with higher lending rates
and the risk that its debt servicing costs may become
intolerable.
 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard said the
country had to improve the quantity and quality of savings to
turn around the imbalances in the economy and cut foreign debt,
reiterating similar warnings he had made during the global
financial crisis.
 ""Our net external liabilities cannot keep increasing with
impunity,"" Bollard said in a speech to a business group.
""Rather than await such painful punishments, we should be
looking to improve the situation.""
 He also said that the country's economic growth was more
robust and justified the move to higher interest rates.
 The New Zealand dollar  was unmoved by Bollard's
remarks, holding around the $0.6920 level. Interest rate
futures <0#NBB:> were also steady.
 ""In the medium-term, it (the warning) is relevant, but
short-term implications are going to be zero,"" said Thomas
Harr, a currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in
Singapore, adding that markets were somewhat less concerned
with such risks in the country because of the global economic
recovery.
 A debt-fuelled property boom was a key factor in the
central bank raising rates to a record high 8.25 percent in
July 2007, and then holding them there for nearly a year before
launching a series of cuts after the global crisis hit.
 Bollard said several times during the ensuing recession
that any return of the behaviour would jeopardise a recovery,
and his comments on Monday were seen by market watchers as
another warning to households to cut debt and look for more
productive investments than housing.
 Last week, the RBNZ lifted its cash rate to 2.75 percent
from a record low of 2.50 percent in its first move since the
crisis ended.
 The RBNZ is expected to steadily raise interest rates into
the early part of next year as the economy picked up steam,
even as the bank said further rises depend on how the economy
and financial markets would be doing. [ID:nSGE65904N]
 ""Any signs of a return to the borrow and spend ways of old,
will undoubtedly be accompanied by a policy response,"" said
Goldman Sachs JBWere economist Philip Borkin.
 Last month, the government introduced new policies to close
loopholes and anomalies which have favoured residential
property investment and had been seen as distorting economic
performance.
 CAUTIOUS RECOVERY
 Bollard's comments were seen as a reminder to local
investors that a return to hefty borrowing for unproductive
investments would increase the risk of New Zealand suffering
the sort of fallout that has hit the highly indebted euro zone
countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain.
 New Zealand household debt in the first quarter of 2010 was
NZ$182 billion ($126 billion) or 155 percent of income, versus
156 percent of income in neighbouring Australia in the fourth
quarter last year, according to central bank data.
 As a percentage of their disposable income, New Zealand
household debt peaked at more than 160 percent early in 2008,
nearly three times the level in late 1990.
 Bollard also said there was only so much that either
monetary or fiscal policy could do to reduce imbalances.
 New Zealand relies heavily on foreign borrowing to fund its
deficits because of perennially low levels of household saving.
 ""New Zealanders ... are prepared to constrain consumption
to improve their savings. The question is how much rebalancing
they contemplate, and for how long,"" Bollard said.
 The annual current account deficit narrowed to 2.9 percent
of GDP in the December quarter from a peak of 9 percent in the
first half of 2006, as recession dented demand for imports and
reduced the New Zealand earnings of foreign investors.
 New Zealand's net external liabilities fell to 90.3 percent
of GDP from a peak of 94.3 percent earlier last year. But that
was still high compared with around 60 percent in Australia.
 Ratings agency Fitch has said it will keep New Zealand's
AA-plus rating on negative outlook until there is a significant
improvement in the high level of external debt.
 Separately, data released on Monday showed domestic
activity has remained patchy through the early part of the
year.
 Retail sales for the month of April fell 0.3 percent,
against expectations of no change, pointing to consumers
remaining cautious. See [ID:nSGE6590LP]
 A survey showed growth in the services industries eased
slightly for a second month in May, as activity was seen to be
consolidating after emerging from recession.

 * Aussie pierces first layer of resistance at $0.8552
 * Dollar index backs down further from recent high
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro's short-covering rally
took it briefly above $1.22 to its strongest in a week on Monday,
although traders were wary about driving it too far, while the
Australian dollar climbed to its highest point in four weeks.
 With early Asian trade thinned by a holiday in Australia,
traders said the euro popped stop-loss buy orders at $1.2160,
laying the groundwork for a push above $1.22 as holders of short
euro positions bought it back, fuelling the jump.
 The euro, locked in a downtrend on worries about euro zone
fiscal problems, recovered to its highest level since early June
against the U.S. dollar, while the Australian dollar extended a
rally from late last week on improved risk tolerance to tackle
the first of several layers of resistance.
 The Aussie, which fell in April and May as the euro tumbled,
breached $0.8552, its highest in four weeks, and now faces
resistance at about $0.8570-80, stemming from a low in February
and a 38.2 percent retracement of its April-May drop.
 ""I suspect there are euro short positions left in markets so
there will probably be a bit more short-covering,"" said Daisuke
Karakama, a market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 ""But its rebound will run out of gas. There will be an EU
summit this week, but European policymakers appear to have run
out of policy steps for now.""
 The market remains wary of euro zone sovereign debt problems
and the risks these pose to the banking sector.
 The euro has lost 15 percent against the dollar this year but
managed to gain 1.6 percent in the course of last week as it
pulled up from a four-year low at $1.1876.
 It was at $1.2182, up 0.6 percent from late U.S. trade on
Friday, after reaching as far as $1.2208.
 European Union leaders meet on Thursday and are expected to
make a new attempt to convince markets they can contain debt
problems by agreeing how to tighten economic policy coordination
and strengthen budget discipline.
 SCOPE IN A DOWNTREND
 Nonetheless, how the region's growth weathers belt-tightening
is also a question in investors' minds and data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed speculators boosted
their bets against the euro in the week ended June 8, although
net short positions were below record levels.
 With the market still very short euros, Sue Trinh, a senior
FX strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, did not rule
out a push up as far as $1.24-$1.25 within its downtrend.
 ""If the moves continue then we could start running into
systematic-type stops for the likes of euro/dollar and the DXY
(dollar) more generally,"" she said.
 CFTC data showed speculators also increased bets in favour of
the U.S. dollar last week, while they cut net long positions in
the Australian dollar almost to half.
 The Aussie rose 0.7 percent to $0.8564 after probing as far
as $0.8570. It peaked just below $0.94 in April but twice found
support at $0.8065-80 and has risen since, making chartists look
for signals that it can recover higher.
 It also gained 0.6 percent on the low-yielding yen, which
was soft across the board, to 78.69 yen, touching its highest in
nearly four weeks.
 The euro climbed 0.8 percent to 111.93 yen, briefly brushing
112.01 and its firmest level against the Japanese currency for
more than a week.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 91.89 yen, edging above its
30-day moving average.
 But the dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
major currencies, fell 0.7 percent to 86.942, retreating further
from a 15-month high above 88.70 set last week and slipping below
its 14-day moving average at 87.251.
 Sterling edged up against the dollar after dropping sharply
on Friday but continued to lose ground against the reviving euro
 Britain's new fiscal policy watchdog is due to give estimates
later on Monday which are expected to pour cold water on the
previous government's hopes for a powerful recovery and offer
hints on the scale of spending cuts and tax hikes seen as needed
to rein in the budget deficit.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, June 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to a
one-month high on Monday, led by a rally in the technology
sector, while the euro rebounded in thin trade, squeezed higher
by dealers forced to close bets against the currency.
 Major European stock futures were up as much as 1.1 percent
as investors bought back risky assets.
 Global equities are set for a fourth consecutive session of
gains, driven mainly by the materials sector, which closely
follows business cycles. The same sector has been heavily sold
since April, as investors cut exposure to riskier assets,
fearing the worldwide recovery was losing momentum.
 However, tech stocks were leading major indexes in Japan
and South Korea higher on Monday, after semiconductor
chipmakers last week gave positive news about demand, helping
Wall Street recover early losses on Friday.
 The fundamental picture has not changed much, with many
economists still expecting the U.S. economy to grow around 3
percent this year and next, even after May U.S. retail sales
unexpectedly fell for the first time in eight months.
 ""We're seeing pretty active short-covering on a sense that
recent risk avoidance moves were exaggerated, leaving markets
oversold,"" said Takashi Ushio, head of the investment strategy
division at Marusan Securities in Tokyo.
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 1.8 percent, with tech
names TDK and NTT Data among the biggest boosts to the index.
 The market for semiconductors will likely grow 6 to 7
percent for the next five years, helped by strong demand in
China, Morris Chang, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's
chief executive and chairman, told the Financial Times.
 TSMC is the world's biggest contract chipmaker.
 ASIA STOCKS STILL CHEAP
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan climbed
1.4 percent to the highest since May 19.
 The index is trading at 11.5 times its earnings expected 12
months forward, a bit higher than at the start of June but
still cheaper than the 5-year average of 13.2 times, Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S data showed.
 With bets against the euro near record highs and bets on
the Australian dollar slashed last week, dealers took advantage
of the relative quiet and trimmed their positions.
 The euro was up 0.6 percent to $1.2192, having earlier
triggered small stop-loss orders all the way up to around
$1.2207.
 This week the focus for the euro will be a meeting of
European Union leaders on Thursday to convince sceptical
investors they can tighten budgets to contain a sovereign debt
crisis and boost growth at the same time.
 ""I suspect there are euro short positions left in markets

Daisuke Karakama, a market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank
in Tokyo.
 ""But its rebound will run out of gas. There will be an EU
summit this week, but European policymakers appear to have run
out of policy steps for now.""
 The Australian dollar was up 0.6 percent to US$0.8570,
having strengthened by nearly 4 cents in the last week. It
peaked just below $0.94 in April and then found support at
$0.8065-80, making chartists look for signals that it can
recover higher.
 Short-term investors in the International Monetary Market
cut their bets on the Australian dollar in half in the week to
June 8, suggesting that positioning will not be an obstacle to
further strength in the currency.
 The Korean won leapt around 1.9 percent, a relief rally
after Seoul announced foreign exchange regulations over the
weekend that were largely in line with expectations.
 The weaker dollar was one of the factors pushing up oil
prices. U.S. crude for July delivery rose 1.4 percent to $74.79
a barrel.
 Since crude traded at a 10-month low on May 20, it has
drifted higher and gained $10.

 * But Merkel, Sarkozy to present united front in Berlin
 * Meeting key for setting tone of EU summit on Thursday
 
 By Sarah Marsh and Emmanuel Jarry
 BERLIN/PARIS, June 13 (Reuters) - The leaders of France and
Germany will seek to overcome deep-rooted disagreements on
European economic governance at a meeting in Berlin on Monday,
setting the tone for a European Union summit later this week.
 A show of unity from Berlin and Paris, the motors behind
European integration, is seen as crucial for reaching decisions
at the summit on Thursday on tightening policy coordination and
strengthening budget discipline to contain a debt crisis.
 The EU must persuade financial markets the bloc has a common
response to the worst crisis to hit the 16-country euro zone
since the single currency was created 11 years ago and can
prevent Greece's debt problems spreading to other countries.
 ""The crisis showed the European system had arrived at its
limits: you cannot have a common currency and such gaps in
competitiveness,"" a French government source said. ""You cannot
have one country (Germany) where everything is oriented towards
gains in productivity and competitiveness and other countries
favouring consumption and social protection.
 ""Either we manage to come closer or we risk having a
political crisis as well as an economic and financial crisis.""
 Yet Paris and Berlin are at loggerheads over the correct
approach to closer economic governance -- so much so that German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
postponed their talks initially scheduled for last week for fear
they would be unable to reach an agreement, the source said.
 Influential German magazine Der Spiegel said at the weekend
Franco-German relations had reached a ""historic low"".
 France's priority is to create an ""economic government"" for
the euro zone -- something Germany has resisted -- with regular
summits of the 16 leaders and a dedicated secretariat, to
coordinate economic policy and focus on rebalancing the European
economy and boosting growth.
 Paris has also called for Germany to boost domestic spending
in order to balance its huge trade surplus.
 Berlin last week launched the biggest austerity drive in
Germany since World War Two and sees budget discipline as a
priority, pressing Paris to implement savings measures.
 The German Finance Ministry has circulated a 9-point plan
demanding stiffer sanctions against governments that flout
European fiscal rules, including suspending repeat offenders' EU
voting rights, and an insolvency procedure for states.
 
 CONCESSIONS
 Nonetheless, Sarkozy and Merkel went some way to assuaging
concerns about a French-German rift last week by issuing a
letter to the European Commission calling for faster financial
reform and an EU-wide ban on naked short selling of shares and
sovereign bonds.
 In addition, France looked to anchor its commitment to
tighter fiscal policy at the weekend by pledging to cut the
budget deficit by 100 billion euros by 2013 and to bring it down
to the EU target of 3 percent of GDP.
 According to the French government source, Paris believes
firmer budget commitments by euro zone governments and other
concessions such as approving Bundesbank President Axel Weber to
succeed Jean-Claude Trichet at the head of the European Central
Bank, could enable a rapprochement with Berlin.
 He added new EU institutions for economic governance would
not likely see the light of day any time soon.
 ""Economic governance is something that will take one or two
years. You shouldn't think we will have a breakthrough on June
14 or 17,"" he said. ""It is a birth that will be long and
difficult because the interests at stakes are colossal.""

 SEOUL, June 13 (Reuters) - South Korea on Sunday announced
long-anticipated curbs on banks' currency trades, saying it aimed
to rein in short-term foreign debt and volatile capital flows
that posed a risk to the world's ninth-biggest exporter.
 The new steps will cover all currency derivatives trades,
including non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), cross-currency swaps
and forwards.
 Following is a collection of comments from bankers and
analysts in response to the measures:
 - - - -
 HEAD OF A FOREIGN BANK'S SEOUL BRANCH, WHO ASKED NOT TO BE
NAMED DUE TO THE SENSITIVITY OF THE MATTER:
 ""Foreign banks and institutional investors will eventually
adapt to the changed regulations without causing much significant
problems in the financial markets. But I think the authorities
could have done it in a more gradual way, such as setting a high
ceiling and then later lowering it over time.""
 ""The reason the markets reacted so wildly to the talk of
controls recently was that this new set of rules could mark the
start of a series of additional controls in the coming months.""
 LEE JIN-WOO, SENIOR FX ANALYST, NH INVESTMENT & FUTURES
 ""The government could have done this when the foreign
exchange market was fluctuating wildly due to the mismatch
problem (in foreign funds several years ago). Now it's time when
many people are worried about a possible outflow due to the
European fiscal crisis. I think these new measures could drive
the won down too much.""
 HEAD OF ANOTHER FOREIGN BANK'S SEOUL BRANCH, SPEAKING ON THE
CONDITION OF ANONIMITY:
 ""It looks like there are political reasons behind making such
an announcement at this time when the government is hosting G20
summit this year and financial markets are stabilising.""
 ""The only short-term impact will be a reduction in short-term
foreign borrowing, with foreign banks curtailing borrowing. This
may be what the government wants to see in the short term.""
 ""But the measures may cause market volatility to rise further
in the near term. Doing arbitrage trade in South Korea will be
unprofitable to foreign banks and foreign banks may move the
arbitrage trade outside OF South Korea due to regulation risks
here.""

 SEOUL, June 13 (Reuters) - South Korea on Sunday announced
long-anticipated curbs on banks' currency trades, saying it aimed
to rein in short-term foreign debt and volatile capital flows
that posed a risk to the world's ninth-biggest exporter.
 The new steps will cover all currency derivatives trades,
including non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), cross-currency swaps
and forwards.
 Following are new measures announced jointly by the Ministry
of Strategy and Finance, the Financial Services Commission, the
Financial Supervisory Service and the Bank of Korea:
 FX DERIVATIVES POSITIONS AT BANKS
 - Foreign bank branches will not be allowed to hold
foreign-exchange derivative contracts in excess of 250 percent of
their equity capital in the previous month.
 - The limit for domestic banks and other financial companies
was set at 50 percent of their equity capital.
 - The measures will be finalised next month and come into
force three months later, so most likely in October.
 - Financial institutions will have up to two years to comply
with the new requirements. The actual grace period will depend on
individual requests and discussions with regulators.
 - Foreign-exchange derivatives contracts held by foreign bank
branches amounted to 301.2 percent of their equity capital at the
end of April and those held by domestic banks stood at 15.6
percent.
 - Authorities will review the curbs every quarter and may
adjust the ceilings.
 LIMITS FOR COMPANIES
 - The ceiling on foreign exchange forwards, swaps and other
derivatives of domestic non-financial companies will be reduced
to 100 percent of their physical trade from a 125 percent cap
introduced in November 2009.
 CURRENCY LENDING BY BANKS TO DOMESTIC NON-FINANCIALS
 - Banks' lending to domestic non-financial companies in
foreign currency will be limited to companies that need foreign
exchange to pay for overseas transactions. The restriction aims
at limiting borrowing to finance speculative financial trades.
 - Small and medium-sized manufacturing companies will be
allowed to roll over their existing borrowings.
 - The new measure will come into force in July
 FX LIQUIDITY RATIOS
 - Domestic banks have to own long-term foreign-currency
assets sufficient to fully cover their long-term foreign
liabilities. This requirement has been tightened from a 90
percent requirement introduced in November 2009.
 - Foreign bank branches are not subject to the required ratio
but will be recommended to set their own standards to the similar
effect.
 - Foreign bank branches will be totally exempt from liquidity
management obligations if their head offices submit guarantees to
provide sufficient liquidity in emergency.

smooth volatile capital flows and stressing that the new rules
were not intended to guide the won's exchange rate.
 The well-flagged new restrictions put limits on banks' and
other financial institutions' currency forwards, cross-currency
swaps as well as non-deliverable currency forwards.
 ""These measures are aimed at reducing the volatility in
capital flows that poses a systemic risk in the country instead
of driving the exchange rate into a specific direction,"" South
Korea's finance ministry, its two financial regulators and the
central bank said in a joint statement.
 The authorities, alarmed by the won's  sharp swings in
turbulent markets, have been priming markets for weeks for some
form of controls.
 As already suggested by various officials the new rules will
cap domestic banks' and non-bank financial institutions' currency
forwards and derivatives at 50 percent of their equity capital.
The cap for foreign bank branches was set at 250 percent of
equity to account for their lower capital, which on average is
just 1/30 of that held by domestic banks.
 The regulations are expected to come into force in October
and banks will have up to two years to fully comply with the new
limits, the authorities said.
 The won weakened in the past week in anticipation of the
curbs and their possible dampening impact on market liquidity and
investors had looked for assurances that banks will be given
sufficient time to adjust to limit the impact of the new rules.
 The authorities said they would review data every quarter to
make possible adjustments to the introduced ceilings.

 * Beijing keeping a close eye on big EU countries
 * Export tax rebates may drop to deter energy-intensive
goods
(Adds more ministry comments, paragraphs 6-9)
 BEIJING, June 12 (Reuters) - Debt strains in the euro zone
will take a toll on Chinese exports in the coming months, the
Ministry of Commerce said on Saturday.
 Exports surged 48.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the
government reported on Thursday, sending a reassuring signal to
markets about the vigour of global demand.
 But the ministry said it typically takes Chinese companies
two months or so to fulfil orders, so May's shipments reflected
orders booked before Europe's debt mess deepened.
 The euro zone and the International Monetary Fund had to
bail Greece out in April after it was unable to roll over its
debts in the bond market, raising fears about the financial
health of other big borrowers and triggering a plunge in the
euro.
 ""In the next few months the negative impact from Europe's
debt crisis on Chinese exports may gradually show up,"" the
ministry said in a statement distributed at a monthly news
conference.
 Yao Jian, a spokesman for the ministry, told the conference
that export growth would slow from July onwards.
 ""In the next two to three months, we will keep a close eye
on changes in European markets, especially in Germany, Spain,
Italy and Britain, and take some measures,"" Yao said. He did
not specify what steps China would take and when.
 But Yao did say that China might cut export tax rebates for
energy-intensive products, thus penalising the manufacture of
such goods, in a bid to reach its goals for cleaner growth.
 China is racing against the clock to meet its five-year
plan to cut energy intensity per unit of GDP by 20 percent in
the years from 2006-2010.
 The commerce ministry also said the sovereign debt crisis
in the euro zone was one of several uncertainties hanging over
the world economy and would limit the pace of the global
recovery.
 Despite May's export surge, it was hard to be optimistic
about full-year prospects, the ministry said.
 By contrast, China's brisk recovery would keep sucking in
imports at a fast pace. As a result, the country's trade
surplus would gradually fall further.
 The surplus in 2009 shrank to $196 billion from $295
billion in 2008.

 * Prior record was $2.11 million in 2008
 * Winner's identity not immediately known
 By Elinor Comlay and Jonathan Stempel
 NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - A bidder has agreed to pay
$2.63 million for a steak lunch with the billionaire investor
Warren Buffett in a charity auction held on eBay Inc's website.
 The highest bid in the 11th annual auction topped the
previous record $2.11 million paid in 2008 by Zhao Danyang, a
Hong Kong investor. Wealth manager Salida Capital Corp of
Toronto won with a $1.68 million bid in 2009.
 The identity of the winning bidder could not immediately be
determined after bidding closed Friday night.
 EBay was not immediately available for comment. Berkshire
Hathaway Inc, Buffett's insurance and investment company, did
not immediately return a request for comment.
 The winner and up to seven friends will dine with the
world's third-richest person at the Smith & Wollensky
steakhouse in midtown Manhattan. Smith & Wollensky is also
donating $10,000.
 As in his increasingly frequent television appearances,
Buffett will talk about pretty much anything apart from what he
is buying and selling.
 Proceeds benefit the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco
non-profit organisation offering meals, healthcare, child care,
housing and job training for the poor and homeless. Glide is
also known for lively Sunday morning services that include
gospel music.
 Buffett began auctioning the lunches in 2000 after his
first wife Susan introduced him to Glide and its founder, the
Rev. Cecil Williams.
 In a Friday interview, Williams said the auction was
critical to Glide because the economy has caused donations to
fall 20 percent this year, while demand for Glide's services
was up 30 percent. Glide's annual budget is about $17 million.
 The auction began on Sunday night, and the top bid rose
from $1.8 million in the last hour. Nine bidders made a total
of 77 bids. Entering Friday, the highest bid had been $900,100,
according to eBay.
 ""I'm jumping for joy. There's no doubt about it,"" Williams,
80, said after the high bid had topped $1.5 million. ""Warren
Buffett understands Glide and he supports Glide. I said to him
a week-and-a-half ago, 'You're such a good person,' and he
laughed and said, ""Well you know, I'm trying, I'm trying.'""
 The 10 prior auctions had raised more than $5.9 million.
The first three were live, with top bids ranging from $25,000
to $32,000, according to Glide.
 Buffett, 79, built an estimated $47 billion fortune running
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which operates about 80
businesses and has tens of billions of dollars of investments.
 In 2006, Buffett pledged most of his wealth to the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities. Bill Gates,
a Microsoft Corp co-founder, is a Berkshire director.
 Susan Buffett died in 2004. Warren Buffett remarried two
years later on his 76th birthday.
 The following are winners of the Glide auction since
bidding moved online:
 2003 -- David Einhorn, Greenlight Capital, $250,100
 2004 -- Jason Choo, $202,100
 2005 -- Anonymous, $351,100
 2006 -- Yongping Duan, $620,100

 NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - World stocks and the dollar
rose on Friday after a surprisingly strong reading of U.S.
consumer sentiment buoyed recovery prospects, even as an
unexpected drop in U.S. retail sales damped risk appetite.
 Wall Street, which had traded lower for much of the
session, rose in a late-day rally, capping a volatile week in
which stocks slid close to a seven-month low. But the Dow and
S&P 500 ended up more than 2 percent for the week.
 While analysts said the underlying trend of steadily rising
consumer spending was intact, a 1.2 percent drop in U.S. retail
sales in May reported by the Commerce Department on Friday sent
oil prices lower and lifted the price of safe-haven bonds.
 Gold gained for a third straight week as recovery concerns
firmly underpinned prices. But copper posted its largest weekly
gain since early April on rising demand expectations from the
United States and China, the world's two largest consumers.
 Investors were torn between two currents: those who see
little risk of the U.S. economy slipping back into recession
and those who fear a slowdown after a brief recovery.
 ""We have placed a double-dip in the U.S. for a long time at
15 percent and that is still where we are. The most likely
scenario is the economy continues to grow at a 3 percent pace,""
said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton,
Connecticut.
 Still, the unexpected drop in U.S. retail sales heightened
fears generated by Europe's sovereign debt crisis. For more see
[ID:nN11114277].
 ""Without that spending, what is going to drive economic
activity?"" said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion
& Walsh Inc in Parsippany, New Jersey.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
up 0.6 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst <.FTEU3>
closed up 0.5 percent to 1,018.87 points.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 38.54
points, or 0.38 percent, to 10,211.07. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 4.76 points, or 0.44 percent, to
1,091.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 24.89
points, or 1.12 percent, to 2,243.60.
 For the week, the Dow rose 2.8 percent, the S&P gained 2.5
percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.1 percent.
 Wall Street threw off worries over the disappointing retail
sales late in the day as the focus turned to a strong forecast
from chip maker National Semiconductor Corp  .
 Even so, the volume was lackluster, indicating little
conviction that the advance will continue next week.
 The dollar rose against the yen and euro on the
better-than-expected rise in the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan's Surveys of Consumers.
 Lingering worries about euro zone debt and technical
barriers also contributed to the euro's decline, ending a
three-day winning streak that drove it as high as $1.2152.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 91.67 yen  in late
trading. The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2087 , its first
daily decline since Monday, when it hit $1.1876, its lowest
level since 2006. The euro edged up to 110.86 yen .
 U.S. oil prices fell more than 2 percent on the U.S. retail
sales drop and an easing of industrial output in China, which
revived concerns about oil demand. [ID:nSGE65A07B]
 Friday's slide snapped a three-day string of higher closes,
but for the week oil prices still managed a 3.17 percent gain.
 ""The retail sales number put a damper on things and the
report on Chinese inflation had already helped pull oil back,""
said Robert Yawger, senior vice president, energy futures at MF
Global in New York.
 Chinese inflation quickened to a 19-month high in May, and
some analysts said China needs to raise interest rates and let
the yuan strengthen. China is the world's second biggest oil
consumer. [ID:nTOE65A019]
 U.S. crude for July  fell $1.70, or 2.25 percent, to
settle at $73.84 a barrel, trading from $73.26 to $75.64.
 ICE Brent  fell 94 cents to settle at $74.35, but
ended up 4.6 percent on the week.
 Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields ended marginally higher on
the week after retracing some of Thursday's spike due to the
stock rally. The 10-year note yield  finished at
3.23 percent, the middle of a 3 percent to 3.50 percent trading
range which analysts said would hold through the summer.
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled up $8
at $1,230.20 an ounce.
 Earlier in Asia, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan
stocks <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose nearly 1.7 percent. Japan's Nikkei
average <.N225> climbed 1.7 percent, helped by a halt in the
yen's advance against the euro .

 TORONTO, June 11 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar retreated
against its U.S. counterpart on Friday for the first time in
five days as softer than expected retail sales report in the
United States raised concerns about economic recovery.
 Retail sales in the United States, which buys around
three-quarters of Canadian exports, fell unexpectedly in May
for the first time in eight months. Total retail sales dropped
1.2 percent, versus forecasts for 0.2 percent growth.
[ID:nN11114277]
 As well, the price of U.S. crude oil futures ended below
$74 a barrel. Canada is the biggest oil supplier to the United
States, and its currency is often influenced by moves in oil
prices. [O/R]
 ""The general negative impact the retail sales had on
equities helped to drive a little bit of that risk-aversion
trade,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a currency Strategist at Scotia
Capital.
 ""If you're a shot-term person you'd think: I don't want to
touch Canada right now. I'd rather touch some other currency,""
Tihanyi said.
 The disappointing retail data raised concerns about the
health of consumer spending and kept U.S. stocks down for most
of the day. However, equities managed to stage a late afternoon
rally, which helped to trim the currency's losses. [.N]
 The Canadian dollar finished at C$1.0338 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.73 U.S. cents, down slightly from Thursday's
North American finish of C$1.0312 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.97
U.S. cents.
 Still, the currency's slide was cushioned by a surprisingly
strong reading of U.S. consumer sentiment.
 The Canadian dollar was up 2.6 percent this week as
investor fears over European the sovereign debt largely
dissipated. It was the currency's best weekly performance since
October 2009.
 ""It's kind of a sigh of relief and a change of pace from
the downside volatility that's come from the ongoing euro zone
grind,"" said Tihanyi.
 He added that the market currently expects the currency to
trade between C$1.0300 and C$1.0400 to the U.S. dollar.
 BONDS GAIN
 Canadian bond prices edged higher across the curve as the
weak U.S. retail data fed a safe-haven rally, mimicking moves
in the U.S. Treasury market. [US/]
 ""We do take a lot of price discovery from the U.S. and we
had very disappointing retail sales come out this morning in
the U.S.,"" said Ian Pollick, portfolio strategist at TD
Securities.
 ""What that really shows us is there is a certain fragility
in consumer spending.""
 On the domestic data front, strong manufacturing growth in
the first quarter drove a record jump in industrial capacity
use. [ID:nN11107657]
 The report is not normally seen as a major market mover,
but essentially reaffirmed that economic recovery is on track
in Canada, said Pollick.
 The two-year government bond  was up 6 Canadian
cents to yield 1.789 percent, while the 10-year bond
 rose 16 Canadian cents to yield 3.415 percent.
 Canadian bonds underperformed U.S. issues across the yield
curve. The 10-year Canadian yield was 18 basis points above its
U.S. counterpart, from about 11 basis points in the previous
session.

 NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
yen and euro on Friday as data showing improvement in U.S.
consumer sentiment suggested the U.S. economic recovery remains
on track.
 Lingering worries about euro zone debt and technical
barriers also contributed to the euro's decline, ending a
three-day winning streak that drove it as high as $1.2152.
 Data showing U.S. consumer sentiment near a 2-1/2-year high
was ""quite a pleasant surprise,"" particularly given the recent
backdrop of market volatility and stock market weakness, said
RBS Securities strategist Alan Ruskin.
 The rise in consumer sentiment offset an unexpected 1.2
percent slide in U.S. retail sales last month and left markets
more confident that U.S. interest rates would rise before those
in Europe or Japan.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the dollar was up
0.3 percent at 91.67 yen. A warning from Japan's new prime
minister that the country could risk default if it neglects
growing public debt and loses the market's trust added to yen
losses.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2087, its first daily
decline since Monday, when it hit $1.1876, its lowest level
since 2006. The euro edged up to 110.86 yen.
 The single currency was still poised to end the week up
around 1 percent against the dollar after rallying for most of
this week. Despite the gain this week, the euro is down nearly
16 percent on the year.
 Traders said the market remains wary of euro zone debt and
the risks it poses to the banking sector.
 On Friday, the euro's rally stalled after running into
technical resistance around $1.2150, traders said. According to
Reuters data, a next major resistance level on the euro is set
at $1.2917.
 ""That was the level at which the euro broke down (in early
June), so we've closed the gap, a technically normal move that
doesn't indicate a change in the bigger picture, which is
dominated by negative euro sentiment,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Other traders said a successful auction of Italian
government bonds had helped bolster the euro earlier following
strong demand at a Spanish auction on Thursday.
 MIXED DATA, NEXT WEEK
 Sterling fell 1.2 percent to $1.4528 after an unexpected
fall in British industrial production while the dollar rose 0.6
percent to 1.1499 Swiss francs.
 The mixed U.S. data on Friday sparked some concern about
U.S. consumer spending -- which typically accounts for about
two-thirds of the country's economic activity -- and analysts
at Tempus Consulting in Washington said the dollar probably
needs more evidence of housing and labor market strength before
it can add much to recent gains.
 ""Obviously, the numbers have disappointed some, but we kind
of expected retail sales to be down as consumers boosted their
own savings, and that correlated also to a fall in the stock
market,"" said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist at
Tempus. ""I suspect the dollar will continue to be range-bound
against most of its trading partners.""
 U.S. growth is still considered likely to outpace Europe's.
While German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday a stable euro
had helped the euro zone weather its debt crisis, she said
Germany's economy would not likely match its 2008 growth levels
until 2012 or 2013.
 Some key events next week may include the policy meetings
by the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan.
 Analysts at UBS AG said markets will be looking into
whether SNB intervention is going to continue, and in the case
of Japan, whether the bank will provide any additional schemes
to improve credit provision, especially with the new government
in place.
 In the United States, next week's data highlights include
readings on industrial production and consumer prices.

 COPENHAGEN, June 11 (Reuters) - World No.1 container shipper
Maersk Line announced unusually high peak season surcharges on
freight rates from Asia to Europe following what it said was
exceptional demand this year as global trade recovers.
 The subsidiary of Danish shipping and oil group A.P.
Moller-Maersk said on Wednesday it would introduce a $750
surcharge per 20 foot container (TEU) and a $1,000 surcharge per
40 foot container (FEU) on July 15. 
 Vincent Clerc, head of Maersk's Asia-Europe route, said
demand on the route is up 23 percent so far this year compared
with the previous year and demand in the third quarter -- the
traditional peak season -- is also expected to be stronger than
usual.
 The high demand will lead to shortage of space on the
vessels and for containers during the period, Clerc said.
 ""The utilisation on the vessels, the demand for
transportation in the second quarter has been much higher than
normal, which means there's less slack in the network to
accommodate for the peak that is coming,"" he said.
 Clerk said this year's high peak surcharges are higher, and
will be introduced a bit earlier, than usual due to the strain
on the network of vessels.
 Shares in Maersk closed up 2.2 percent, outperforming an
unchanged Copenhagen blue-chip index.
 Global trade continues to recover from depressed levels in
2009, when the industry slashed capacity in response to the
global downturn.
 ""A lot of the capacity has come back but the market increase
is very atypical. Nobody's network has 23 percent slack,"" Clerk
said.
 Maersk has not set an end date for the peak season
surcharges.
 ""It's a very atypical year, with very atypical numbers, so
we cannot estimate,"" Clerc said.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2010 12:11PM ET</span>",No preferred status for euro zone SPV bonds-source," By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, June 11 (Reuters) - Bonds that could be issued by
the euro zone's special-purpose vehicle to raise cash for
countries in trouble would not have preferred status, a euro
zone source said on Friday.
 Market participants have been wondering whether bonds issued
by the SPV, guaranteed by euro zone countries, would have a
status senior to other government paper. 
 Such a status would ensure the bonds have to be repaid
before other debt, making them more attractive to the market and
boosting their price.
 ""The bonds will have no preferred creditor status,"" the euro
zone source, with insight into the SPV, said. 
 This is the same arrangement as with bilateral loans of
countries from the 16-nation euro zone to Greece, which could
total up to 80 billion euros ($96.3 billion) over three years,
and which have no preferred status either.
 The source also said there were no particular limits on
which maturities the SPV could issue.
 ""Everything is possible, including long-term bonds,"" the
source said.
 The company, called the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF), is likely to become fully operational at the
end of June. It will be able to borrow up to 440 billion euros
on the markets to help any euro zone members no longer able to
finance themselves sustainably on the market.
 This is an arrangement separate from the Greek rescue
package.
 Euro zone finance ministers have chosen Germany's Klaus
Regling, a former director-general of economic affairs in the
European Commission, to be chief executive of the
Luxembourg-registered EFSF.
 Regling will take office on July 1, said Guy Schuller,
spokesman for Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.
 Regling, who has also worked for the German Finance Ministry
and the International Monetary Fund, will prepare and chair
meetings of the EFSF's board of directors from its euro zone
shareholders, but will not vote, the euro zone source said.
 Should the EFSF issue bonds, Regling would play a key role
in organising and managing the issue. He will also manage the
small staff of the SPV and represent the company externally.
 The German finance agency will execute the treasury
activities of the SPV, and the European Investment Bank would
provide back-office services.

 By Herbert Lash and Dominic Lau
 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - World stocks marched
higher on Friday after a strong reading of U.S. consumer
sentiment eased jitters over an unexpected drop in U.S. retail
sales that had lifted the safe-haven price of bonds and gold.
 The U.S. dollar edged up against the yen and U.S. stocks
trimmed losses after consumer sentiment improved in early June
to its strongest level since March 2008, the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers said. For
details see: [ID:nN11121462]
 The report lifted the mood of investors after data showing
poor U.S. retail sales in May raised doubts about the strength
of recovery and took the wind out of four-day relief rally in
world stocks.
 ""It's a good number and could provide reassurance after the
retail sales number, which was particularly weak,"" Nigel Gault,
chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
Massachusetts, said about the consumer survey.
 Oil prices had slipped below $74 a barrel and copper

Benchmark copper for three-month delivery  reversed
course to trade up about 1 percent in London.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>
rebounded to trade 0.5 percent higher, helped by a rally in

 But the Dow and broad-market S&P 500 hovered near
break-even, even as the technology-rich Nasdaq rose.
 ""We had a nice one-day advance yesterday, and this will
kind of relieve some of the pressures,"" said Steve Goldman,
market strategist at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 ""I think the (stock) market is looking for reasons to
stabilize, and this provides some of that,"" said Goldman.

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
11/32 in price to yield 3.28 percent. It had earlier traded up
18/32.
 Markets earlier were buoyed after Belgium, Portugal and
Spain found good demand for their bonds this week. Italy also
carried out a successful sale on Friday, easing immediate
concerns about funding problems on the euro zone periphery and

 * Opposes GM cultivation proposal before review, says Borloo
 * Spain opposed to Commission's proposals, says Espinosa
 (Adds quotes, details, background)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 LUXEMBOURG, June 11 (Reuters) - France said on Friday it
would not support draft proposals to allow European Union
governments to grow or ban genetically modified (GM) crops
before a complete review of the bloc's GM approval system.
 The EU's executive, the European Commission, argues that
giving member states the option of banning GM cultivation will
remove their current opposition to approving new varieties, and
plans in July to table proposals seen by Reuters.
 But France's Environment Minister Jean-Louis Borloo said the
proposals did not address the demand for a complete review of
the bloc's assessment system for GM crops, made by all 27 EU
nations in December 2008.
 ""There is no way we would swap subsidiarity for the absolute
need for a tightening of the assessment criteria,"" Borloo told
journalists before a ministers' meeting in Luxembourg to discuss
the EU's GM approval system.
 ""No new authorisations can be approved in the current
circumstances,"" he added.
 While France did not rule out support for the Commission's
plan if its conditions were met, Spain's Agriculture Minister
made it clear that she opposed the proposals.
 ""Moving to authorisations by each country could take us to
the beginning of re-nationalisation, something we have never
supported in Spain,"" Elena Espinosa said before the meeting.
 Spain's opposition comes despite the fact that it currently
grows more GM crops than any other EU nation.
 
 SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT
 EU governments' demand for a review of the GM assessment
system in 2008 was sparked by concerns that the bloc's
scientific advisory body, the European Food Safety Agency
(Efsa), was ill-equipped for the job.
 A key complaint was that Efsa was too reliant on data
provided by biotech multinationals including Monsanto, BASF and
Syngenta for its assessments, and lacked the expertise required
to carry out its own analyses.
 But the Commission has yet to respond to the demand, clearly
hoping that its cultivation proposals would be enough to ease
member states' fears.
 If approved, the plan could see a sharp growth in commercial
cultivation of GM crops in countries already growing them, such
as Spain, Portugal and the Czech Republic.
 Existing GM bans in countries including France, Italy and
Austria would also be confirmed under the plans, and other
countries would be free to introduce new bans at any time.
 But a Belgian EU diplomat was among those who warned that
the plan could fragment the EU's cherished internal market, and
leave the bloc open to challenges in the World Trade
Organisation by countries such as the United States, who have
complained that the EU's GM policies are unscientific.
 Environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the
Earth have strongly criticised the proposals, saying they
confirm the Commission's determination to push GM crops onto an
unwilling European public.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 11 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
yen on Friday as data showing an improvement in U.S. consumer
sentiment in June offset weaker-than-expected May retail sales,
reassuring some investors about state of the economy.
 The euro was little changed, snapping a three-day winning
streak against the dollar as lingering euro zone debt worries
and options-related selling stalled its rally above $1.21.
 While recent economic data has suggested a steady U.S.
recovery, Friday's reports painted a mixed picture when it
comes to consumer spending and confidence, and that kept
currency moves fairly modest.
 ""The (consumer) numbers are good, but we had a pretty bad
report earlier on retail sales, which were very disappointing,""
said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 Having climbed more than 15 percent against the euro so far
this year, Salvaggio said better news and the housing and labor
fronts will be necessary for the dollar to add to gains.

 The dollar was last up 0.4 percent at 91.70 yen ,
while the euro was flat at $1.2113 
 Traders said the euro's mini-rally this week hit technical
resistance in the $1.2150-55 area earlier. It's decline in May
and early June accelerated when it fell below this area and
bottomed out at $1.1876 this week, its lowest since early 2006.
The euro was up 0.5 percent at 111.09 yen .
 The yen was more sensitive to market risk appetite, traders
aid, than to a warning from Japan's new prime minister, who
warned Friday that the country could risk default if it
neglects its growing public debt and loses the market's trust.
[ID:nTKF106969].
 EURO DEBT WOES STILL LINGERING
 Analysts still expect the Federal Reserve to hike U.S.
interest rates before counterparts in Japan and Europe, and
that should help the dollar in the months ahead.
 RBS Securities strategist Alan Ruskin said the gain in
consumer sentiment was ""quite a pleasant surprise...with no
sign of any hit from recent equity weakness or volatility.""
 Some market participants said a successful auction of
Italian bonds had helped bolster the euro earlier following
strong demand at a Spanish auction on Thursday.
 Despite the euro's sell-off this week it is poised to end
1.5 percent higher against the dollar, which would be its best
weekly performance this year.
 It has shed 1.5 percent on the month and more than 15
percent this year, driven by fiscal concerns in the euro zone.
 Many in the market expect the euro will stay under selling
pressure in the longer term on concerns that debt problems in
some euro zone countries are spreading.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2010 10:27AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Seeing through the fog of volatility," * Volatility surge plays havoc with short-term trades
 * Data suggests volatility spikes create buying opportunity
 * Political risks creating pricing difficulties
 * Buying vol funds seen by some as a hedge
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) -- For long-term investors,
financial volatility is like the weather; the storms are
temporary, leaving attractive opportunities when the skies
clear.
 The recent resurgence of financial uncertainty -- seen most
clearly in a doubling of the Vix index of Wall St equity
volatility in the first three weeks of May alone -- plays havoc
with short-term trading and for many leveraged hedge funds.
 Stoked by euro sovereign debt fears and sabre-rattling from
financial regulators, this latest surge in the so-called ""fear
gauge"" -- a key proxy for global risk appetite at large -- saw
emerging market hedge funds indices, for example, drop some 6
percent during May.
 But for investors with longer-term horizons and valuation
convictions, history suggests this is not the time to head for
the bunkers.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For graphic of Vix volatility index versus world equities:
http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/10/GLB_VXEQ0610.gif
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Remarkably, data on U.S. money market or cash funds shows
that while there was some renewed demand for these safe havens
during the past six weeks, net outflows from these boltholes
since the start of May was still a hefty $40 billion and the net
exit this year in excess of a whopping $350 billion.
 ""You normally make most of your money when the Vix is high,
and not when it's low -- which is exactly what we saw in 2009
when the Vix peaked and rolled over,"" said Guy Monson, Chief
Investment Officer at asset manager Sarasin and Partners.
 ""Instinctively, it should start to whet the strategist's
appetite when the Vix starts to rise.""
 Monson cited research on equity performance at different
levels of the Vix that showed over the past 20 years when the
index is above 28.5 percent -- which has been 17 percent of the
time -- the underlying S&P 500 equity index has gained an
average of 36 percent per annum.
 Conversely, when the Vix is at 21.5 percent or below, which
is more than half the time, the market has fallen by 4.3 percent
per annum.
 On Friday, the Vix was still hovering about 30 percent,
having peaked at almost 50 percent on May 21 from as low as 16
percent a month earlier.
 
 PICKING THE TIME
 Of course, to see high volatility as a time to buy now
requires a firm belief that underlying fundamental valuations
remain sound and that the cause of the volatility is temporary
and not structural.
 But many analysts feel that volatility spiked this time
around in large part because markets are finding it difficult to
price the vagaries of political decision making, which are
dominating the resolution of the euro crisis and the global
regulatory backlash to the credit crunch.
 Markets are typically adept at discounting economic and
earnings trends but are less confident second-guessing the risk
of random political actions like Germany's recent unilateral
naked short-selling ban or Australia's mining tax plan.
 ""Big government is back and the market is having difficulty
accurately pricing political risk -- it's really not had to do
it for 20 years. It's broadly been a Thatcherite, Reaganomic
laissez-faire environment for that time,"" said Monson.
 ""But for the most part, politicians are probably rational
operators and if they are operating within a G20 framework they
are probably restrained for big one-off events,"" he added.
 The fundamental backdrop, meantime, throws up compelling
stories for European blue chips with global exposure.
 The euro's decline, for example, should prove a boost for
the world's second-biggest exporter Germany while dividends for
the EuroStoxx50 yield in excess of 100 basis points over
benchmark euro government bonds.
 
 HEDGING VOL
 Some investors, especially managers of so-called funds of
funds, reckon one way to see through the storm is to actively
use volatility to hedge an underlying bullish portfolio.
 After buying in March into BNP Paribas's Vol Edge fund,
which is indexed to the forward implied volatility of the
Eurostoxx50, the multimanager team at F&C Investments said it
then exited the position in mid May.
 ""We began 2010 with the view that this was going to be a
recovery year and as such wanted to be long risk assets. We also
believed there would be periods during the year when risk
aversion would rise dramatically as the markets climbed the
""wall of worry"", said F&C fund manager Paul Carne.
 BNP Vol Edge made returns in excess of 50 percent during
this period, shielding the portfolios from the full impact of
losses elsewhere.
 ""We are keeping our mind open to put this trade on again in
the future should volatility hit our target levels once again,
depending on the market environment,"" Carne said.
 Others see this sort of hedging as simply too expensive.
 Kees Verbaas, executive director of emerging markets at
Hermes, which manages $3 billion in emerging market equities,
mainly for British pension funds BT and Royal Mail, said there
is a certain amount of country rotation during spikes in the Vix
but the positive longer-term view has to be the main guide.
 ""Month-to-month performance during periods of high
volatility can make you look like a star or an idiot,"" said
Verbaas, who added his funds long-term view was two or three
years. ""But if you have a client who will tolerate that focus on
the long term them it saves a lot of costs.""

 * Slams ratings agencies for 'irresponsible' actions
 * Draghi says euro is here to stay
 * Wellink says Greece should have been helped out earlier

(Recasts, adds Bini Smaghi, details)
 By Krista Hughes and Marc Jones
 FRANKFURT, June 11 (Reuters) - Financial markets are
exaggerating the risks to the euro zone, which is on an economic
recovery path, and to the single currency, European Central Bank
policymakers said on Friday.
 The ""really irresponsible"" behaviour of credit rating
agencies was compounding the problem, Executive Board member
Juergen Stark said in a Reuters Insider Television panel
discussion as he defended the ECB's controversial decision to
buy government bonds.
 ""Markets are, clearly in the current circumstances
overshooting, we do not deny that we have severe problems in the
euro zone but they are less severe than market reaction
suggests,"" he said.
 Other ECB policymakers also came to the defence of the euro
in appearances across Europe, where 16 countries share the
common currency that came into being in January 1999.
 The euro is poised to end the week 1.5 percent higher
against the dollar, which would be its best weekly performance
this year. But it has shed nearly 16 percent this year against
major trading currencies, driven lower by fiscal worries.
 ""People have to understand that the euro is (here) to stay,""
Mario Draghi, head of Italy's central bank and a member of the
ECB's rate-setting Governing Council, said in Helsinki.
 In Venice, the ECB's Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said any defection
from the euro would be ""highly detrimental"" for all concerned.
 With the focus on the debt crisis that spilled out of Greece
to rattle investor confidence in the broader currency area, the
financial markets risked ignoring the fact that recovery was in
train even if it remained modest, another ECB board member said.
 ""The growth outlook (in the euro zone) shows a much better
performance but recovery is still not very strong,"" Gertrude
Tumpel-Gugerell told reporters during a visit to Warsaw.
 In Frankfurt, Stark said it was ""crazy"" to question whether
the euro had a future and said there was no alternative to the
single currency for Europeans. 
 ""It is not a crisis of the euro, it is a crisis of sovereign
debt. And this crisis is not limited to the euro,"" he said.
 ""What in my view market participants do not consider in the
current circumstances is the fact that economic fundamentals --
before the crisis but also during the crisis and very likely, I
am certain, after the crisis -- will remain strong,"" he said.
 
 RATING AGENCIES UNHELPFUL
 Credit rating agencies, already under fire for giving high
grades to products that ended up fuelling the first phase of the
global financial crisis, were not helping by downgrading
countries even as they announced deep budget cuts, Stark said.
 ""(Ratings agencies) follow the market, they act in
pro-cyclical way and this is not helpful,"" he said, backing
calls for a separate European ratings agency.
 ""To go a step further, there could be vested interests. What
we really need is an independent view of the situation and how
to assess the situation."" 
 Standard and Poor's downgrade of Greece to 'junk' status
even while authorities were working on a bailout plan
particularly irritated policymakers, and Stark said the ECB did
not take ratings as gospel.
 Asked if the ECB had hurt its credibility by buying
lower-quality bonds, he said: ""Government bonds of lower quality
only to the rating agencies.""
 The ECB has not said which bonds it has bought, but Stark's
comments are in line with media reports that most of the 40.5
billion in purchases settled by last Friday are Greek.
 Investors are now worried that banks may get into trouble
because of heavy investment in the bonds of Greece and other
weaker euro zone economies that are burdened with bloated debts.
 Nout Wellink, head of the Dutch central bank as well as a
member of the ECB Governing Council, said Europe should have
stepped in to help Greece earlier, and that Athens should have
been called to account earlier too. 
 ""There should have been peer pressure on Greece years ago
... The whole country lived beyond its means and the public
sector lived beyond its means,"" Wellink said.
 Policymakers also backed the ECB's decision to offer banks
extra unlimited funds over three months, denying that it would
fan bank dependency on central bank cash.
 ""No, this is not linked. These measures are to make the
money market work better,"" Bini Smaghi said in Venice.

small steps towards an elusive deal.
 A streamlined climate draft, meant to help talks on a new
pact, cut out some of the most draconian options for greenhouse
gas and dropped all references to ""Copenhagen"" -- where a U.N.
summit in December fell short of agreeing a treaty.
 ""The group is dismayed that the ... text is unbalanced,""
developing nations in the Group of 77 and China said in a
statement. Several of them said the 22-page text wrongly put
emphasis on greenhouse gas curbs by the poor, not the rich.
 Among rich nations, the United States said it would study
the text but that some elements were ""unacceptable"". The
European Union also expressed ""concerns"" about the text, which
updates a previous 42-page draft rejected last week.
 The new text outlines a goal of cutting world emissions of
greenhouse gases by ""at least 50-85 percent from 1990 levels by
2050"" and for developed nations to reduce emissions by at least
80-95 percent from 1990 levels by mid-century.
 It drops far more radical options, some championed by
Bolivia, for a cut of at least 95 percent in world emissions by
2050 as part of a fight to slow droughts, floods, a spread of
disease and rising sea levels.
 Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe of Zimbabwe, who chairs the
U.N. talks on action by all nations to slow global warming, said
the text would be updated for a next meeting in Bonn in August.
 
 SHORTCOMINGS
 Yvo de Boer, the departing head of the U.N. Climate Change
Secretariat, said he felt the main reaction to the text was
that, ""yes, it has shortcomings...but that people are willing to
take it as the basis for future work.""
 Many delegates say that a new legally binding deal is out of
reach for 2010 and now more likely in 2011. Apart from deep
splits over negotiating texts, U.S. legislation on cutting
emissions is stalled in the Senate.
 The May 31-June 11 session was the biggest since Copenhagen,
where more than 120 nations agreed a non-binding deal to limit a
rise in average world temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius
(3.6 F) over pre-industrial times.
 But it lacked details of how to reach this goal.
 ""This session has made important progress...Countries have
been talking to each other rather than at each other,"" de Boer
said of the Bonn talks.
 De Boer said there was progress on climate funds, sharing
green technology and issues such as slowing deforestation. He
said an extra meeting of negotiators was likely in China before
an annual meeting in Mexico from Nov. 29-Dec. 10.
 The new draft text keeps some elements of the Copenhagen
Accord, including a plan for aid to developing nations of $10
billion a year from 2010 to 2012, rising to more than $100
billion from 2020.
 Australian delegate Robert Owen-Jones announced in Bonn that
Canberra was contributing 559 million Australian dollars ($469
million) to the 2010-12 funds.

 * Too soon to put figure on Hungarian bank tax effect
 * Sees 2010 risk provisioning at 2009 level, or lower
 * 2010 will remain difficult, hopes for 2011 improvement

 By Nick Edwards
 VIENNA, June 11 (Reuters) - Austria's Erste Group, which
aims to become the second biggest lender in Hungary, expects
long negotiations over the country's proposed new tax on banks,
its chief executive said on Friday.
 Hungary's new prime minister, Viktor Orban, vowed on Tuesday
to introduce a tax on banks, seen raising 200 billion forints
($856 million) for this year alone as part of measures to reduce
the budget deficit and allay market fears for the economy.
 Last week officials from Orban's Fidesz party had rattled
markets by suggesting that the country could face a Greek-style
debt crisis.
 ""That is sort of the reflex of some politicians now - 'let's
mention an amount, put it to the public and then let's talk
about how we actually do it'"", Andreas Treichl told Reuters
Insider.
 ""So we don't know and we think there will be some lengthy
negotiations on that over the next weeks and months,"" he added.
 In Hungary some homeowners with foreign currency mortgage
loans have been hit by the decline in the forint, but that was
not the problem, Treichl said.
 ""Contrary to what everybody believes the problems in the
region are not so much the secured mortgage loans --if they have
been done properly. It's more those loans which have not been
done properly. And local currency consumer lending has been hit
much harder than well-done foreign exchange denominated mortgage
loans,"" Treichl said at the sidelines of a meeting of the
Institute of International Finance here.
 Hungary's biggest bank with roughly a quarter of the market
is domestically-owned OTP.
 The next six banks in the pecking order are units of KBC,
Erste Group Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Raiffeisen International,
BayernLB and UniCredit.
 Treichl said his plan to become the country's biggest bank
after OTP had not changed at all.
 ""If we would change our long term strategy because of
political events? These are all democratic countries in the
European Union -- it has a very strong government at the moment,
a lot of things they are doing we fully agree on and we even
agree on the idea that they have to do something to reduce the
budget deficit. We do have a quite a different opinion on the
approach,"" he said.
 Treich said that the bank's business in the second quarter
was ""OK"". ""We are somewhat more conservative in our view on how
risk will develop in the region. We don't see a deterioration
anymore, but also on the same side we don't see any kind of
improvement. We think that from a risk point of view, the
situation will be pretty difficult for a pretty long time.""
He said that while there was a double-digit increase in bad
debts in the first quarter he did not expect that to continue.
""We basically went into 2010 under the assumption that our
risk provisioning levels will remain at the level of 2009 and
there's not much happening to make us change our mind.""
"" If we're lucky they will be somewhat lower but the economic
growth we have for the moment -- it's there, there is no
question -- but it's not sufficient for it to help some of the
weaker players in the economy. I think we'll stick (to the view)
that 2010 will be somewhat difficult, hopefully 2011 we will see
quite an improvement.""

60,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2010 08:19AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Did somebody say 'decoupling'?," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - There is a growing worry for
investors as they head towards the second half of the year --
will governments' increased appetite for budget cutting knock
the nascent global economic recovery off track?
 The answer might come down to a somewhat discredited
concept, the ""decoupling"" of economies that sees some driving
forward while others lag.
 That was what was supposed to happen as the
subprime/financial crisis built, but it didn't.
 Many investors have assumed for some time that while the
debt crisis in Greece and mounting fiscal problems in other
peripheral euro zone countries is a serious matter, the
long-term outlook for world economic recovery looks good.
 Now, however, there is a rush by governments to get their
accounts in order, a kind of synchronised austerity that
threatens to crimp the ability of economies to spend their way
towards growth.
 This challenges many assumptions among investors, who have
hung on to a belief that equities will recover from the current
correction because of economic growth.
 The latest to join the austerity movement is Germany, which
unveiled a package to deliver savings of 11.2 billion euros
($13.48 billion) next year, lower this year's budget deficit,
and increase savings to 19.1 billion euros in 2012, 24.7 billion
euros in 2013 and 26.6 billion the following year
 Britain, too, has begun cutting its budget, so far aiming to
save 6 billion pounds ($8.74 billion) this year.
 The two moves prompted independent investment advisers
Lombard Street Research to refer in a client note to an
""Anglo-German stupidity shoot-out"" -- a veiled reference to past
football matches between the two on-field rivals.
 ""Anglo-German fiscal policies virtually guarantee a fresh
European recession, possibly a medium-term depression,""
strategist Charles Dumas wrote to his clients.
 
 ON ONE ENGINE
 It is at this point that decoupling comes into view, the
idea being that while Europe might struggle as a result of its
debt/austerity tango, major economic engines such as China and
the United States will carry on growing.
 ""In effect, the global economy has lost an engine with
Europe,"" said Michael Dicks, head of research and strategist at
Barclays Wealth.
""It means you are still flying, but it is not as balanced.
It is a trickier ride.""
 China showed some of its resilience in the past week,
reporting a near 50 percent annual surge in exports in May.
 That was enough to keep equity markets rallying from recent
lows. World stocks were up 1.6 percent for the week, heading
towards one of their better performances of the year.
 China was also behind what was shaping up to be the euro's
best week of 2010. The single currency has fallen around 15
percent against the dollar this year but was up some 1.7 percent
for the week.
 This was partly due to comments from Dai Xianglong, chairman
of China's $114 billion National Social Security Fund and a
former governor of the country's central bank.
 His view that the euro would gradually stabilise was taken
as a sign that China is not about to cut back on its euro
reserves, a fear that has risen as the euro has fallen.
 As for the world's largest economy, U.S. data has been
generally positive. The coming week will test this with a series
of housing reports including permits and starts.
 Europe's situation, meanwhile, should get an airing at the
mid-year European Union leaders' summit in Brussels.
 
 SPILLING OVER
 All this is macro, but investors are also having to struggle
at the moment with a micro crisis -- that of BP and its
environmentally and economically damaging oil spill.
 The problem for investors when it comes to BP is a kind of
eggs-in-a-basket one. It is so large a part of many benchmarks
that a sharp stock fall or a suspension of dividend has way more
impact that it would have if it were another company.
 Just one example, courtesy of Evolution Securities, is that
a suspension of BP's dividend would lowers the total yield
return for UK stocks to the same or a bit less than that for UK
gilts.
 This could prompt not just a flight from BP, but also from
British equities in general, many of which are big names held
widely by global investors.
 The damage being wrought on portfolios by BP's decline,
meanwhile, could prompt large institutional investors to review
their holdings again to make sure they are not too behoven to
one company or sector.
 All this will be a focus in the week ahead and could mean
more volatility.

 * Deutsche's Ackermann confident Greece can service debt

 By Krista Hughes and Marc Jones
 FRANKFURT, June 11 (Reuters) - Financial markets are
exaggerating the risks to the euro zone, which is on an economic
recovery path, and to the single currency, European Central Bank
policymakers said on Friday.
 The ""really irresponsible"" behaviour of credit rating
agencies is compounding the problem, Executive Board member
Juergen Stark said in a Reuters Insider Television panel
discussion as he defended the ECB's controversial decision to
buy government bonds.
 ""Markets are clearly in the current circumstances
overshooting, we do not deny that we have severe problems in the
euro zone but they are less severe than market reaction
suggests,"" he said.
 Other ECB policymakers also came to the defence of the euro
in appearances across Europe, where 16 countries share the
common currency that came into being in January 1999.
 The euro is poised to end the week 1.5 percent higher
against the dollar, which would be its best weekly performance
this year. But it has shed nearly 16 percent this year against
major trading currencies, driven lower by fiscal worries.
 ""People have to understand that the euro is (here) to stay,""
Mario Draghi, head of Italy's central bank and a member of the
ECB's rate-setting Governing Council, said in Helsinki.
 In Venice, the ECB's Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said any defection
from the euro would be ""highly detrimental"" for all concerned.
 With the focus on the debt crisis that spilled out of Greece
to rattle investor confidence in the broader currency area, the
financial markets risked ignoring the fact that recovery was in
train even if it remained modest, another ECB board member said.
 ""The growth outlook (in the euro zone) shows a much better
performance but recovery is still not very strong,"" Gertrude
Tumpel-Gugerell told reporters during a visit to Warsaw.
 Greek Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou, speaking at a
meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Vienna,
said he would do what was needed to put Greece back on a growth
track and ruled out a Greek default or exit from the euro zone.
 Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef Ackermann, speaking at
the same gathering, said he had changed his view on Greece and
was now confident it would be able to service its debt thanks to
its prime minister's commitment to reform.
 In Frankfurt, Stark said it was ""crazy"" to question whether
the euro had a future and said there was no alternative to the
single currency for Europeans. 
 ""It is not a crisis of the euro, it is a crisis of sovereign
debt. And this crisis is not limited to the euro,"" he said.
 ""What in my view market participants do not consider in the
current circumstances is the fact that economic fundamentals --
before the crisis but also during the crisis and very likely, I
am certain, after the crisis -- will remain strong,"" he said.

 RATING AGENCIES UNHELPFUL
 Credit rating agencies, already under fire for giving high
grades to products that ended up fuelling the first phase of the
global financial crisis, were not helping by downgrading
countries even as they announced deep budget cuts, Stark said.
 ""(Ratings agencies) follow the market, they act in
pro-cyclical way and this is not helpful,"" he said, backing
calls for a separate European ratings agency.
 ""To go a step further, there could be vested interests. What
we really need is an independent view of the situation and how
to assess the situation."" 
 Standard and Poor's downgrade of Greece to 'junk' status
even while authorities were working on a bailout plan
particularly irritated policymakers, and Stark said the ECB did
not take ratings as gospel.
 Asked if the ECB had hurt its credibility by buying
lower-quality bonds, he said: ""Government bonds of lower quality
only to the rating agencies.""
 The ECB has not said which bonds it has bought, but Stark's
comments are in line with media reports that most of the 40.5
billion in purchases settled by last Friday are Greek.
 Investors are now worried that banks may get into trouble
because of heavy investment in the bonds of Greece and other
weaker euro zone economies that are burdened with bloated debts.
 Nout Wellink, head of the Dutch central bank as well as a
member of the ECB Governing Council, said Europe should have
stepped in to help Greece earlier, and that Athens should have
been called to account earlier too. 
 ""There should have been peer pressure on Greece years ago
... The whole country lived beyond its means and the public
sector lived beyond its means,"" Wellink said.
 Policymakers also backed the ECB's decision to offer banks
extra unlimited funds over three months, denying that it would
fan bank dependency on central bank cash.
 ""No, this is not linked. These measures are to make the
money market work better,"" Bini Smaghi said in Venice.

 * Highest reading since August 2008
 * Jump unlikely to fan wage pressures given growth headwinds
 
 (Adds reaction, background)
 By Christina Fincher and Peter Griffiths
 LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - Britons' expectations for
inflation over the next 12 months jumped to 3.3 percent in May,
the highest level in nearly two years, a quarterly survey from
the Bank of England showed on Friday.
 That compared with 2.5 percent in February and was the
highest since August 2008.
 The sharp rise may be a worry to the BoE, which wants to
ensure that expectations of above-target inflation do not get
entrenched, leading to a long-term cycle of price rises and
higher wage demands.
 Still, analysts questioned the extent to which higher
expectations would feed into wage rises given the weakness of
the recovery and a looming public spending squeeze.
 ""It's worth keeping this number in context. When consumer
price inflation last went above target, inflation expectations
got to above four percent,"" said Alan Clarke, UK economist at
BNP Paribas. ""It's uncomfortable, but it's not flashing red
yet.""
 Consumer price inflation hit a 17-month high of 3.7 percent
last month, almost double the central bank's target. The survey
showed the public was not far off the mark, estimating current
inflation at 3.6 percent.
 
 SHORT-LIVED PRESSURE?
 The BoE maintains the recent spike in inflation is due to
temporary factors and price pressures will abate later this year
when the economy feels the effects of what economists expect to
be the sharpest austerity drive in modern British history.
 ""We would not get too worried,"" said Vicky Redwood at
Capital Economics. ""Inflation expectations were much higher when
inflation rose in 2008, but inflation still fell back sharply.""
 Britain's coalition administration has warned of ""painful
times ahead"", with budget cuts of up to 20 percent expected in
some departments as it tries to reduce a deficit running at
nearly 11 percent of GDP.
 Prime Minister David Cameron said dealing with the deficit
will affect the ""whole way of life"" in Britain, where one in
five workers is employed by the state. The government, which
took power last month, will publish its first budget on June 22.
 Britain's economy pulled out of recession at the end of 2009
but the recovery remains fragile and most economists do not
expect the BoE to start tightening policy until early 2011.
 The survey showed some 52 percent of Britons expect interest
rates to rise over the next year compared to 6 percent who see a
fall.
 UK interest rates have stood at 0.5 percent since March
2009, when the BoE also launched an unprecedented scheme of
asset purchases with newly-created money.

 * Limits to apply to forwards, currency swaps, NDFs
 * Focus on grace period for banks to adjust
 By Yoo Choonsik and Cheon Jong-woo
 SEOUL, June 11 (Reuters) - South Korea's government is
likely to announce on Sunday new rules on currency trading that
will apply to a range of trades and derivatives with the aim of
making the won less volatile, officials said.
 Planned caps on currency forwards will also cover
cross-currency swap trades as well as non-deliverable currency
forwards, an official at the financial regulator said.
 The watchdog's chief later all but confirmed that the new
rules would be unveiled on Sunday. ""You'd better not make any
appointments on Sunday,"" Chin Dong-soo told reporters.
 The authorities, alarmed by the won's sharp swings in
turbulent markets, have been priming investors for weeks for
action aimed at reducing volatility and short-term foreign
debt.
 According to government sources, the new rules would focus
on banks' currency forwards and the most likely scenario would
limit domestic banks' positions half of their equity, with the
cap set at 250 percent for foreign bank branches, which
typically have much lower capital.
 The won closed 0.4 percent higher and South Korean
cross-currency swaps stabilised on Friday after a slide earlier
this week, in a sign that markets have largely discounted the
news.
 Analysts said markets will now focus on how much time banks
will be given to conform with the new rules.
 ""If it is short and banks have to unwind their positions
rapidly then the new rules would exacerbate rather than reduce
market volatility,"" Standard Chartered Bank said in a note.
 Among possible scenarios mooted by government sources is a
three-month delay with which the new rules would come into
force and then banks would be given additional two years to
meet the new limits, which analysts say should help to calm
market nerves.
 LOPSIDED MARKET
 Authorities believe the won is more exposed to markets'
gyrations than most Asian peers because of a high proportion of
short-term foreign debt.
 The debt, equivalent to 60 percent of the nation's currency
reserves and 40 percent of total foreign liabilities, largely
reflects an imbalance in the forward market caused by heavy
dollar selling by shipbuilders and other big exporters in the
forwards market.
 This depresses costs of dollars making borrowing the U.S.
currency and swapping into won, particularly attractive.
 In addition, banks need to offset long dollar positions in
their deals with exporters with dollar borrowing, which also
drives up short-term debt volumes, leaving South Korea exposed
to a sudden dollar squeeze, similar to that that followed the
collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
 Korean authorities estimate that on average foreign banks
forward positions amount to 250-300 percent of their capital
suggesting that as a whole they would require relatively
moderate adjustments. However, Barclays Capital estimates the
figure at around 500 percent, meaning foreign banks would need
to unwind positions totalling around $35 billion.
 The unwinding of the forwards would also prompt some
offloading of South Korean bonds and stocks by investors who
use the dollar/won forwards to protect their investments
against currency risk, Barclays said.
 Nevertheless, JPMorgan said in a note the new rules should
have limited impact mainly because banks would probably be
given some time to adjust their positions.
 Kim Eng Tan, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's in
Singapore said the planned controls would not affect South
Korea's A rating.
""It probably will raise financing and hedging costs for some
people. But I don't think it's going to be so big an increase
that it will affect economic activity in a very big way,"" Tan
told Reuters.
 Tom Byrne, senior vice-president at Moody's, also ruled out
any impact on ratings. Moody's rates South Korea at A1.
 In November, when the authorities unveiled limits on
companies' currency forwards, the won fell as investors rushed
to cover short dollar positions. But the impact proved
short-lived and the won, then in a rising trend, resumed its
climb. The restrictions announced last year also applied to
currency forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange
swaps and cross-currency swaps.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2010 04:47AM ET</span>","Q+A-As pressure builds, will China let yuan rise?"," (Refiles to add dropped word ""has"" in first paragraph)
 By Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, June 11 (Reuters) - Like the risk-on, risk-off
volatility that has buffeted global markets this year, China's
currency policy has been subjected to bouts of pressure and
criticism from abroad interspersed with periods of calm.
 Beijing is once again facing a pressure-on phase in the
cycle, as underscored by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner's harsh words on Thursday about the yuan.
 Here are some questions and answers at the current juncture
in the long-running yuan debate.
 WHY IS CRITICISM OF THE YUAN HEATING UP AGAIN?
 In a nutshell, U.S. domestic politics.
 With many U.S. lawmakers facing re-election in November and
unemployment hovering just below 10 percent, pressure is
building on President Barack Obama's administration to push
China to break the yuan's nearly two-year-old peg to the
dollar.
 Although many economists believe yuan appreciation would do
little to reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit, a vocal group
of lawmakers in Washington says an undervalued currency
subsidises Chinese exports at the expense of U.S. firms and
jobs.
 On Thursday, Geithner struck his toughest tone since the
Treasury Department delayed a report due in April in which it
needed to decide whether to name China a currency manipulator.
 ""The distortions caused by China's exchange rate spread far
beyond China's borders and are an impediment to the global
rebalancing we need,"" he told a U.S. Senate hearing.
[ID:nN10236564]
 If the Treasury refrains from punishing China, anger in
Washington may only intensify.
 Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said lawmakers would
move forward soon with a bill that would slap anti-dumping
penalties and countervailing duties on goods from China and
other countries with ""fundamentally misaligned"" currencies.
 ARE THE CONDITIONS RIGHT IN CHINA FOR APPRECIATION?
 The two chief considerations for Beijing are whether
exports have recovered after last year's collapse and whether a
stronger currency is needed to suppress inflationary pressure.
 On the surface, the latest Chinese data argue for a
stronger yuan. In May exports surged 48.5 percent year on year,
while inflation hit a 19-month high of 3.1 percent.
[ID:nLDE65A05X]
 But economic facts are never so clear cut.
 Inflationary pressures appear to be ebbing, with consumer
prices down 0.1 percent in May compared with April.
 And the Ministry of Commerce, which has been the most
steadfast opponent in the Chinese government of a stronger
yuan, believes that exports were flattered by a low base of
comparison and have yet to feel the brunt of the European debt
crisis.
 ""Normally, it takes about three months for exports to go
from order to shipment and finally to settlement. At present,
transactions are still based on orders made in February or
March,"" Huo Jianguo, head of the ministry's think-tank, said.
 ""We forecast that the impact of the crisis will become
clear only in the third quarter,"" he said. [ID:nTOE65A008]
 HOW DO RISING LABOUR COSTS FIT INTO THE PICTURE?
 A rare burst of labour unrest in China has halted
production at a series of factories, including Honda parts
suppliers, and stoked concerns about rising wage costs in the
world's largest exporting nation.
 Even if there is no nominal appreciation (i.e. the yuan's
exchange rate remains frozen), higher wages would, in theory,
make Chinese goods more expensive in global markets and hence
constitute real appreciation.
 Factory strikes are a new development in China, but labour
costs have in fact been rising steadily over the past decade.
Wages in the manufacturing sector rose 14.5 percent per year
from 2004 to 2008 and 13 percent annually in the five years
before that, according to UBS estimates.
 Relatively stable profit margins and export prices indicate
that productivity gains have largely offset higher wages so
far.
 This could change, at least in the short run, with some
firms like contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn talking
about doubling wages. But labour typically makes up perhaps 5-8
percent of production costs in China's manufacturing sector,
meaning that final prices need not increase much at all.
 The upshot is that wage increases are, for now, no
substitute for yuan appreciation. But they do give Beijing one
more reason for caution in its management of the currency.
 Zhang Xiaoji, head of international economics in the
Development Research Centre, a think-tank under the cabinet,
noted in an official newspaper on Friday that rising labour
costs would squeeze exporters' profit margins.
 WILL U.S. PRESSURE DELAY YUAN APPRECIATION?
 China has repeatedly insisted that foreign criticism is not
conducive to a resumption of yuan appreciation, and it appeared
to dig in its heels earlier this year when calls from the
United States and the European Union were especially loud.
 With the euro zone debt crisis taking centre stage over the
past two months, complaints about yuan policy have faded away.
Some said this presented Beijing a window of opportunity,
because it would not appear to be bowing to outsiders.
 Many think that the window will be smaller, if not totally
shut, as U.S. pressure flares up again.
 ""One thing is for sure: Schumer's trouble-making won't
shake China's determination to promote reform of the yuan's
exchange rate regime or the pace of that reform,"" He Weiwen, an
economics professor at the University of International Business
and Economics in Beijing, wrote in an official newspaper on
Friday.
 At any rate, investors expect the yuan to rise just 1.03
percent versus the dollar over the next 12 months, according to
pricing in the offshore forwards market. Earlier this year,

(Adds comment, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - The euro was supported on Friday
on the back of higher stocks, but the single currency struggled
to extend its short-covering rally versus the dollar ahead of
technical resistance, while options barriers also capped gains.
 A 0.3 percent rise in European shares helped to support the
euro, but its climb petered out around $1.2150, where options
were due to expire later in the day.
 That level also provided technical resistance, as the
$1.2150-1.2155 region had offered some support during the euro's
downward move in May. A break through $1.2150 this month opened
the way to a fall to $1.1876 this week, its lowest in more than
four years.
 ""Euro/dollar is approaching an important level at $1.2150 --
above that point could see the ongoing correction extend to the
upside,"" said Dag Muller, technical analyst at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""Should we fail to take it out, the market could start to
sell, and we can easily get back to those lows.""
 Many in the market expect the euro will stay under selling
pressure in the longer term on concerns that debt problems in
some euro zone countries are spreading into others.
 But some investors breathed sigh of relief after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on Thursday said
three-month emergency loans to banks would continue until
September.
 He also pledged to keep euro zone liquidity flush until the
end of the year. 
 By 0729 GMT, the euro had risen to $1.2120. Earlier in the
day it rose as high as $1.2148 on Reuters data.
 Along with the $1.2150 level, market participants said
$1.2135 was also in focus, roughly the 50 percent retracement of
the euro's 200-2008 rally.
 Against the yen it rose 0.3 percent to 110.91 yen, above an
8 1/2-year trough of 108.86 yen hit on Monday.
 European shares were boosted by higher equity markets in
Asia and the United States, reflecting slightly better risk
demand all week due in part as strong Chinese export data and
helped to spur optimism about the global economy.
 The dollar inched up 0.2 percent to 91.50 yen, and was
little changed against a currency basket at 87.119.
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars slipped across the
board as traders booked profits on their rallies this week.
 
 AUCTIONS EYED
 Despite the euro's selloff at the start of the week, it is
poised to end 1.5 percent higher against the dollar as investors
have been left with stale short positions in the currency after
its fall to $1.1876.
 It has already shed 1.5 percent this month and nearly 16
percent this year, driven ever lower by fiscal concerns in the
euro zone.
 Some analysts said the market would focus on an auction of
Italian bonds later in the day. On Thursday, the euro got a lift
when strong demand for Spanish bonds eased concern about the
country's ability to finance its debt.
 ""If the auction is met with strong demand and outperformance
in European peripherals continue, it is likely to support risk
markets and high beta currencies at the cost of USD and JPY,""
JPMorgan analysts said in a note.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - World equities extended their
relief rally into a fourth day on Friday on optimism over global
economic growth, while the euro rose and was on track to post
its biggest weekly gain this year.
 Copper also rose for the fourth day in a row, though crude
slipped to trade below $75 a barrel.
 After Belgium, Portugal and Spain found good demand for
their bonds this week, Italy carried out a successful sale on
Friday, easing immediate concerns about funding problems on the
euro zone periphery and boosting appetite for the euro, banking
shares and battered Spanish stocks in particular.
 Investors were also optimistic about China's growth, even
though fresh data showed inflation in the world's third-largest
economy quickened to a 19-month high in May while its factory
output and capital spending moderated.
 On Thursday, Beijing announced a sharp jump in May exports,
boosting investors' confidence about its economy's strength as
Europe grapples with a sovereign debt problem.
 ""The flight to safety that we have seen out of euro and out
of many euro bonds into gilts and into U.S. Treasuries suggests
to me there is not a lot of value in bonds,"" said Neil Dwane,
chief investment officer at Allianz's RCM.
 ""When people have maybe seen some of these rather fat tail
events settle down again, they could well come back to equities
market because the market looks very attractive.""
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
advanced 0.6 percent, helped by a 1.7-percent rise in Tokyo's
Nikkei average.
 The World Index has gained 1.6 percent this week but is
still down 7.6 percent this year.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 put on 0.6 percent, with
oil major BP recovering 7.3 percent amid an oil spill in the
Gulf of Mexico, and the Thomson Reuters Peripheral Eurozone
Countries Index added 2.4 percent.
 U.S. stock index futures were flat to 0.2 percent higher,
indicating a firmer start for Wall Street.
 
 EURO STEADY
 The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.213X, extending a rebound
to the fourth day. The single-currency is up 1.6 percent this
week, on track for its best weekly gains this year.
 ""Euro/dollar is approaching an important level at $1.2150 --
above that point could see the ongoing correction extend to the
upside,"" said Dag Muller, technical analyst at SEB in Stockholm.
""Should we fail to take it out, the market could start to sell,
and we can easily get back to those lows.""
 The euro fell to a more than four-year low earlier this
week.
 German government bond prices fell for a third successive
day on Friday as investors bought 7 billion euros of newly
issued Italian debt in a week that saw strong demand for fringe
euro zone paper.
 The two-year Schatz yield eased 0.9 basis points to 0.510
percent, while the 10-year Bund yielded 2.628 percent, up 1
basis point.
 Crude eased 0.8 percent to trade below $75 a barrel, though
copper rose 1.5 percent.

 * Tax cuts to improve competitiveness, reduce tax evasion
 * Government measures seen boosting growth in longer term
 * New IMF financing line could serve as safety net
 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, June 11 (Reuters) - Tax cuts could boost Hungary's
growth and make its finances more sustainable but the government
must first deliver on budget goals to regain investor confidence
shaken by ill-worded comparisons with Greece.
 Hungary was the first European Union country to need
International Monetary Fund help when the global crisis deepened
in 2008, and will probably need to keep some kind of IMF safety
net even after its current IMF/EU loan expires in October 2010.
 Although the new government's measures announced on Tuesday
include some that pose risks to growth in the near term, the
planned tax cuts could boost growth a few years down the line by
discouraging illegal employment and improving tax compliance,
ultimately making it easier to reduce the country's debt burden.
 ""The important thing is that Fidesz (ruling party) gets the
sequencing right: the government must first show that they can
reduce the deficit and thereby reduce debt,"" said Christian
Keller at Barclays in London.
 ""Then confidence will be established and better growth will
help to make the further debt reductions even simpler -- a
virtuous cycle.""
 The centre-right government, seeking to banish the spectre
that officials raised last week of a Greek-style debt crisis,
proposed steps which include a flat 16 percent income tax, a
hefty tax on banks, and a ban on new foreign currency lending.
 While much depends on the details, analysts said plans such
as the flat income tax and a cut in the corporate tax on small
and medium firms to 10 percent will bolster longer term growth.
 
 TAX EVASION
 However the tax on banks and the ban on foreign currency
loans will curb lending and hamper growth in the short term. A
planned freeze in public sector costs and a cut in some public
wages could also hurt domestic demand this year.
 ""In the short term, I don't think this package will boost
demand next year in the economy, but on the whole the incentives
in the tax regime to work more and employ more people legally
could move things in a positive direction,"" said Zsolt Kondrat,
economist at MKB Bank in Budapest.
 Eszter Gargyan at Citigroup said tax cuts could give
consumption a one-off boost but other measures could partly
offset that. ""Long-term competitiveness gains may also require
structural reforms in the labour market and a stable economic
environment,"" she added.
 Hungary's economy shrank by 6.3 percent last year, but grew
0.9 percent in the first quarter compared to the last quarter of
2009 thanks to rising exports and manufacturing.
 Once a magnet for foreign investment in central Europe,
Hungary's competitive edge has eroded partly due to its high
labour tax wedge, which according to the OECD was smaller only
than Belgium's in the EU, at around 55 percent in 2008.
 High taxes have built a black economy. About 740,000 of
Hungary's 10 million people work in the state sector and in the
private sector hundreds of thousands -- some just on paper, to
evade taxes -- are employed on the minimum monthly wage of
73,500 forints ($374).
 The previous Socialist government cut employers' social
taxes to 27 percent from 32 percent, but a February OECD report
said tax remains ""exceedingly high"" and described ""a classic
vicious circle of burdensome taxation that induces evasion and
participation in the grey economy.""
 
 IMF FINANCING ANCHOR
 The government wants to collect 200 billion forints from the
financial sector through a new tariff this year alone.
 It also wants to ban foreign currency lending -- an engine
of domestic demand which turned into a huge vulnerability.
 ""We view a three-year bank tax ... as negative for growth,""
said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.
 But Hungarians, who endured their second major austerity
package last year since the 1989 collapse of the communist
regime, have welcomed an income tax cut and are cautiously
optimistic.
 ""Maybe we'll be able to pay our mortgage easier. It has been
pretty tough for us. Although ... I'm sure the banks will pass
on their own extra tax to us,"" saidEva Kelemen, 40, a teacher
in Budapest.
 ""I will surely be better off with a 16 percent flat income
tax,"" said Beatrix Vegh, who works in the private sector.
 Investors, who had high hopes for the new government after
April elections, want to see it honour this year's 3.8 percent
deficit target and control the deficit next year as well.
 Even then, they want Hungary to agree a new deal with the
IMF, given a public debt burden of around 80 percent of gross
domestic product.
 ""If the government presents an acceptable economic plan,
market funding is likely to be sufficient to cover public
funding needs,"" said Gargyan at Citigroup.
 ""Nonetheless, given the uncertainties related to global
financing conditions and the weak credibility of the government,
the renewal of the IMF program is likely to ... provide an
anchor for investors and a funding buffer in case of severe
tightening in external liquidity conditions.""

comment)
 By Maciej Onoszko and Karolina Slowikowska
 WARSAW, June 11 (Reuters) - Poland's zloty currency is in an
appreciation trend that could last for years, underpinned by the
strength of the economy, the country's new central bank governor
said on Friday.
 Marek Belka, approved in his job by parliament on Thursday,
said the current zloty exchange rate of about 4.08 to the euro
would be ""exceptionally beneficial"" for euro adoption but
underlined that euro entry remained ""theoretical"" for now.
 ""The zloty is in a so-called appreciation trend,"" Belka, a
former prime minister and IMF economist, told Radio TOK FM.
 Asked whether the trend would continue in the coming years,
Belka said: ""Yes, I think so. This is a function of the
economy's strength and how Poland has dealt with the crisis.""
 Poland's was the only economy in the 27-strong European
Union last year to avoid recession, eking out growth of 1.8
percent. Growth is seen at 3 percent or more in 2010 and
accelerating further in 2011. 
 The zloty has see-sawed with the degree of risk appetite in
choppy global financial markets in recent months, but has fared
relatively well.
 ""Belka supports the zloty sentiment... He's perceived very
well in the investor world...,"" said Karol Zaluski, head of FX
at ING Bank in Warsaw.
 
 EURO
 On the euro, Belka said Poland did not currently meet many
entry criteria and would take some time to meet them all.
Economists see Poland, the EU's largest ex-communist economy,
joining the euro in 2015 at the earliest.
 Belka, who in his previous job headed the IMF's Europe desk
and dealt with the continent's debt crises, said later on Friday
during his swearing-in ceremony in the Polish parliament that he
would defend price stability and central bank independence.
 His term as governor is set for six years.
 Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski has said Belka's
appointment should herald a period of good cooperation between
the government and central bank.
 Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist government was at odds
over several issues with Belka's predecessor, Slawomir Skrzypek,
who was close to the main opposition party. Skrzypek died along
with Poland's president in a plane crash in Russia in April.
 The main domestic obstacle to Poland's euro ambitions is the
budget deficit, which is expected to reach 6.9 percent of gross
domestic output this year due to the economic slowdown which has
battered tax revenues.
 Rostowski told reporters on Friday he expected the deficit
to drop below the EU's 3 percent ceiling in the next two to
three years.

 * Announcement's timing will aim to limit market reaction
 * If steps are on forwards, they will cover swaps and NDFs
 By Yoo Choonsik and Cheon Jong-woo
 SEOUL, June 11 (Reuters) - South Korea will announce within
the next few days new rules on currency trading that will apply
to a range of trades and derivatives, an official at a
financial regulatory agency said on Friday.
 Planned caps on currency forwards will also cover
cross-currency swap trades as well as non-deliverable currency
forwards, the official, who asked not to be named, said.
 The authorities, alarmed by the won's sharp swings in
turbulent markets, have been priming markets for weeks for
action aimed at reducing the currency's volatility and
short-term foreign debt.
 In the past few days government officials have confirmed
media and market speculation that new rules would focus on
banks' currency forwards.
 According to government sources, the most likely scenario
would call for a limit of 50 percent on domestic banks'
positions relative to their equity and a 250 percent cap for
foreign bank branches, which typically have much lower capital.
 ""As far as I know, the measures will be announced within
the next few days,"" the official told reporters, adding the
announcement would be made when ""the likely reaction from the
market will be small.""
 On Friday, the won trimmed its early gains on news that the
new rules could apply to a wide range of derivatives deals.
 The official initially said the measures were expected
within three to four days but later changed the expression.
 LOPSIDED MARKET
 South Korean authorities believe the won is more exposed to
financial markets' gyrations than most of its Asian peers
because of a high proportion of short-term foreign debt.
 The debt, equivalent to 60 percent of the nation's currency
reserves and 40 percent of total foreign liabilities, largely
reflects an imbalance in the forward market caused by heavy
dollar selling by shipbuilders and other big exporters in the
forwards market.
 This depresses costs of dollars making borrowing the U.S.
currency and swapping into won, particularly attractive.
 In addition, banks need to offset long dollar positions in
their deals with exporters with dollar borrowing, which also
drives up short-term debt volumes, leaving South Korea exposed
to a sudden dollar squeeze, similar to that that followed the
collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
 Korean authorities estimate that on average foreign banks
forward positions amount to 250-300 percent of their capital
suggesting that as a whole they would require relatively
moderate adjustments. However, Barclays Capital estimates the
figure at around 500 percent, meaning foreign banks would need
to unwind positions totalling around $35 billion.
 The unwinding of the forwards would also prompt some
offloading of South Korean bonds and stocks by investors who
use the dollar/won forwards to protect their investments agains
currency risk, Barclays said.
 Nevertheless, JPMorgan said in a note the new rules should
have limited impact mainly because market players have been
preparing for certain form of controls for some time and banks
would probably be given time to adjust their positions.
 Among possible scenarios mooted by government sources is a
three-month delay with which the new rules would come into
force and then banks would be given additional two years to
meet the new limits.
 Still, currency traders brace for a spell of increased
nervousness and volatility.
 ""In the short-term, this will reduce offshore player's
access to onshore forward market, widen bid-offer and reduce
arbitrage trades, effectively creating a two-tier market on and
offshore,"" said Andy Ji, senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland in Singapore.
 In November, when the authorities unveiled limits on
companies' currency forwards, the won fell as investors rushed
to cover short dollar positions. But the impact proved short
lived and the won, then in a rising trend, resumed its climb.
The restrictions announced last year also applied to currency
forwards, non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), foreign exchange
swaps and cross-currency swaps.

 TOKYO, June 11 (Reuters) - The euro ran into headwinds above
$1.21 on Friday, as profit-booking set in when it failed to push
through hefty resistance, and investors took a lack of surprises
in Chinese data to book gains in the Aussie dollar.
 The euro, which rose on Thursday for a third straight day,
stalled at important resistance in the $1.2135-55 area, with a
mixture of sellers and stop-loss buy orders expected above there.
 Traders said profit-taking emerged after the euro rallied 1.3
percent on Thursday when higher-yielding currencies such as the
Aussie also climbed and share markets rose, adding that the
market was cautious the short-covering rally may not last long
before the single currency resumed its downward trend.
 ""The run is a little bit exhausted. On the upside the real
cap on this is $1.2217 but it's struggling around the $1.2150
level,"" said Mitul Kotecha, global head of FX strategy at Credit
Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
 The euro climbed as far as $1.2149 before slipping back to
just above $1.2100. It was last above $1.22 on June 4, before
tumbling to a four-year low at $1.1876.
 It has a host of chart points in this area, including
$1.2135, which is roughly a 50 percent retracement of its
2000-2008 rally. Resistance from former support in May sits at
$1.2150-55.
 It has shed 1.5 percent this month and nearly 16 percent this
year, driven ever lower by fiscal concerns in the euro zone, but
it got a lift on Thursday when strong demand for Spanish bonds
eased concern about the country's ability to finance its debt.
 ""I expect the euro to fall in the medium-term. But as sellers
can be squeezed after its rebound this week, I wouldn't be
surprised if it rises above $1.22,"" said a trader at a Japanese
bank.
 A spike in Chinese exports also boosted confidence on global
growth and investors breathed a sigh of relief after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said three-month
emergency loans to banks would continue until September.
 A trader said the ECB's move had encouraged some in the
market to be build positions for the next quarter by buying
higher yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 But after another round of Chinese data on Friday was in line
with leaks and forecasts, Nobuhiko Akai, senior manager of the
forex trading group at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, said those
who bought the Aussie quickly took profits.
 ""The latest rebound buying in the euro is still driven by
short-covering. Unless it goes back to around $1.25, market
sentiment will not change drastically,"" Akai said.
 The euro retreated below 111.00 yen after pushing back above
that level for the first time in a week, while the dollar rose
0.25 percent to 91.55 yen.
 Higher yielding and commodity-linked currencies forged big
gains against the dollar and the yen on Thursday, helped by
Chinese trade numbers.
 The dollar index, which hit at 15-month high 88.708 on
Monday, has since retreated below 88.0 and was little changed at
87.165.
 But the Aussie, which jumped 2.7 percent in the previous
session, failed to maintain a move above $0.8500, faltering at
resistance at $0.8510 and retreated to $0.8438.
 If it can move higher, it faces more resistance at $0.8550
and then about $0.8570, which is a 38.2 percent retracement of
its drop from an April high near $0.94 and a May low at $0.8066.
 ""We are seeing a bit of a cautious move, a gradual step back
in but we're a long way from a big rush back in,"" Kotecha said.

 SINGAPORE, June 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose for a
fourth day on Friday on optimism that the world economic
recovery was on track despite Europe's debt woes, while the
euro was steady after a rally the previous day.
 European equities were set to inch higher, with financial

higher, and France's CAC-40 <.FCHI> to open 6-17 points higher.

 Asian stocks have gained 3.7 percent in the past four days,
but are still down nearly 8.7 percent so far this year.
 There was little impact from a spate of fresh Chinese data.
 The data showed China's inflation accelerated to a 19-month

growth moderated, sending mixed signals about the temperature

 Japan's Nikkei average climbed nearly 2 percent, helped by

 Spain sold 3.9 billion euros of a 3-year benchmark bond

 SINGAPORE, June 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose for a
fourth day on Friday on optimism that the world economic
recovery was on track despite Europe's debt woes, while the
euro was steady after a rally the previous day.
 European equities were set to inch higher, with financial

77,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2010 09:03PM ET</span>",China still needs stable trade policies -researcher," BEIJING, June 11 (Reuters) - Chinese firms have yet to feel
the brunt of the European debt crisis and the government should
maintain stability in its trade policies, a top-level researcher
at the commerce ministry said in comments published on Friday.
 China's exports surged 48.5 percent in May from a year
earlier, blowing past market expectations and rekindling talk
about when Beijing will free the yuan from its nearly
two-year-old peg to the dollar.
 Shipments to Europe also soared, climbing to a 49.7 percent
year-on-year increase from a 28.5 percent annual pace in April.
 But Huo Jianguo, head of the commerce ministry's in-house
think-tank, said it was too early for exports to Europe to have
registered an impact from the debt troubles in the euro zone.
 ""Normally, it takes about three months for exports to go from
order to shipment and finally to settlement. At present,
transactions are still based on orders made in February or
March,"" Huo told the International Business Daily (Guoji
Shangbao), a newspaper published by the commerce ministry.
 ""We forecast that the impact of the crisis will only become
clear in the third quarter,"" he said.
 The Ministry of Commerce has been the staunchest opponent in
the Chinese government of a resumption of yuan appreciation,
insisting that a stable currency remains essential to securing
the country's recovery from the global financial crisis.
 Huo said that exports were looking up, but much more slowly
than the headline figures for May implied.
 It is more sensible to use 2008, not 2009, as a basis of
comparison after the collapse in trade last year because of the
global credit crunch, he said. From this perspective, export
growth was still in single-digits in May, he added.
 ""Our current trade policies should still be held stable,"" Huo
was paraphrased as saying, without specifically referring to the
exchange rate or any other policies.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, June 11 (Reuters) - The euro's short-covering rally
paused above $1.2100 on Friday, with the single currency squaring
up to test significant bands of resistance, and the Australian
dollar held strong gains as firmer share markets improved risk
tolerance.
 The euro, which rose on Thursday for a third straight day,
faced important resistance bands in the $1.2135-55 area with a
mixture of stop-loss buy orders and sellers then expected in the
$1.2150-70 region before it could extend its rebound.
 The euro got a boost on Thursday, climbing about 1.3 percent
on the day, as strong demand for Spanish bonds eased concern
about the country's ability to finance its debt and a spike in
Chinese exports boosted confidence on global growth.
 Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said three-month
emergency loans to banks would continue until September and when
Germany's high court rejected efforts to block German guarantees
for euro zone financial aid.
 ""The state of the euro is very fragile but after the ECB's
assurance for offering banks funds for longer, some in the market
are said to be building positions for the next quarter by buying
higher yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar,"" a
senior manager of a Japanese trust bank said.
 The euro was little changed from late U.S. trading levels
just below $1.2135, which is roughly a 50 percent retracement of
its 2000-2008 rally. Its 14-day moving average comes in at
$1.2157 and it faces resistance from former support in May at
about $1.2150-55.
 Against the yen it gained 0.3 percent to 111.12 yen, pushing
back above 111.00 yen for the first time in a week.
 The dollar also rose 0.3 percent, to 91.60 yen.
 Higher yielding and commodity-linked currencies were holding
on to sizeable gains against the dollar and the yen made in the
previous session.
 The Aussie was hovering just below $0.8500 after a 2.7
percent jump on Thursday. It has resistance first at Thursday's
high of $0.8510, then up to $0.8550 and the $0.8570 area, which
is a 38.2 percent retracement of its drop from its April high
near $0.94 and its May low at $0.8066.

 * Omits deepest cuts, all references to ""Copenhagen""
 
 By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent
 BONN, Germany, June 11 (Reuters) - Negotiators from 185
nations end two weeks of talks on a new climate treaty on Friday
with a new blueprint for a pact that omits the most draconian
options for greenhouse gas cuts by 2050.
 The streamlined 22-page draft also cuts all references in a
previous text to ""Copenhagen"", the host city for a U.N. summit
in December that fell short of a binding deal to slow a rise in
temperatures blamed for heatwaves, floods and rising sea levels.
 The May 31-June 11 talks are the biggest since the summit,
trying to get negotiations back on track even though many
delegates say that a legally binding deal is out of reach for
2010 and is more likely in 2011.
 The new text, issued shortly before midnight (2200 GMT) on
Thursday, is meant as a blueprint to guide negotiators to
overcome rifts between rich and poor nations when they reconvene
at a next session in early August in Bonn.
 It outlines a goal of cutting world emissions of greenhouse
gases by ""at least 50-85 percent from 1990 levels by 2050"" and
for developed nations to cut emissions by at least 80-95 percent
from 1990 levels by mid-century.
 The text drops far more radical options, championed by
Bolivia in the previous draft, for a cut of at least 95 percent
in world emissions by 2050 and for rich nations to cut their
emissions by ""more than 100 percent by 2040"".
 ""It's too early to say how this will be received,"" one
delegate said of the text, prepared by Margaret
Mukahanana-Sangarwe of Zimbabwe who chairs the U.N. talks on
global action. ""People will need to study it more.""
 
 DELAYS, OBJECTIONS
 The United Nations had hoped that the text would be ready by
last weekend to allow debate at the current Bonn meeting after
nations including the United States and some Latin American
states rejected an earlier 42-page draft as unbalanced.
 Bolivia was among a handful of nations to oppose the
Copenhagen Accord in Denmark.
 Agreed by more than 120 nations, the accord seeks to limit a
rise in average world temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius
(3.6 F) over pre-industrial times. But it lacks details of
needed greenhouse gas cuts to achieve the goal.
 While Bolivia's radical proposals are dropped, so are more
than a dozen references to ""Copenhagen"" in the previous text,
for instance in a ""Copenhagen Green Climate Fund"" or the
""Copenhagen Adaptation Framework"".
 The text, however, does keep elements of the Copenhagen
Accord, including a plan for fast-start aid for developing
nations of $10 billion a year from 2010-12, rising to more than
$100 billion from 2020.
 Delegates say the Bonn talks have made progress on some
issues -- such as protecting carbon-storing wetlands or plans to
share green technologies -- but not on core disputes between
rich and poor about greenhouse gas curbs.
""The discussions have been good and constructive,"" said Kim
Carstensen, of the WWF International environmental group. ""We
are not resolving the big crunch issues yet.""
 Many delegates want the talks to end in time to watch the
opening World Cup soccer game between hosts South Africa and
Mexico. By coincidence, the main annual U.N. climate talks will
be held in Mexico in late 2010 and in South Africa in 2011.

quarter kept cutting back on hedging against possible declines
in the gold price, but they did so at a much slower pace than
in the fourth quarter of 2009, when Barrick Gold Corp 
eliminated its entire hedgebook.
 Gold miners in the first quarter removed hedges by buying
back 780,000 ounces of their forward sales, down sharply from 4
million ounces in the fourth quarter.
 A quarterly industry report by Societe Generale and metals
consultancy GFMS Ltd said that the reduction left the global
gold hedge book at 6.75 million ounces at the end of March.
 Hedging allows producers to lock in guaranteed prices for
future output, but it can backfire if the price of spot metal
rises above the hedged price. The buying back of outstanding
hedge positions was a key element of demand in past years.
 Kinross Gold Corp  was the largest de-hedger for the
period, removing 320,000 ounces of its contracts primarily
through the establishing a forward purchase position.
 AngloGold Ashanti , Africa's biggest gold miner,
also shed 140,000 ounces.
 Barrick, the world's biggest gold producer, had cut its
hedges by about 3 million ounces to completely close out its
hedgebook during the fourth quarter.
 Looking forward, the report said the volume of de-hedging
will total 3 million ounces for the year.

 * More fake than real drugs on market, official says
 * Counterfeit drugs now a $200 billion-a-year industry
 
 By John Irish
 PARIS, June 10 (Reuters) - Counterfeit drugs have become a
$200-billion-a-year industry and the 176-nation World Customs
Organisation (WCO) will sign a declaration later this month to
fight the scourge, an official said on Thursday.
 Fake or substandard versions of medicines are often hidden
in cargoes sent on circuitous routes to mask their country of
origin.
""We have more fakes than real drugs in the market,"" said
Christophe Zimmermann, the WCO's anti-counterfeiting and piracy
coordinator. ""In 2007-2008 alone, it rose 596 percent.""
 Pharmacies and back street merchants in Africa sell fake
medicines at rock-bottom prices.
 The World Trade Organisation says fake anti-malaria drugs
kill 100,000 Africans a year and the black market deprives
governments of 2.5-5 percent of their revenue.
 The Brussels-based WCO represents customs operations
globally and has joined with former French president's Jacques
Chirac's foundation to raise awareness at upper echelons to
curtail the illicit industry.
 Spurred by Chirac's foundation, 176 national customs chiefs
will sign a declaration on June 24 to ban the making and
marketing of counterfeit drugs, Zimmermann told Reuters.
 Fake medicines often contain the wrong or toxic ingredients
and pose a growing health threat worldwide, especially in poor
countries where drugs are sold to treat conditions such as
malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.
 ""If these subjects are not dealt with and strong action not
taken, they will be a source of conflict,"" said Catherine
Joubert, director general of the Fondation Chirac, adding that
so far 30 groups had signed the declaration.
 Getting the WCO's 176 members on board will lend legitimacy
to proposals to revamp obsolete legislation and improve
coordination between enforcement agencies, Zimmermann said.
 Western Europeans spend an estimated 10.5 billion euros
($14.3 billion) a year on illicitly sourced medicines, according
to a Pfizer-sponsored survey published in February.
 In a sign Europe is taking the issue seriously too, justice
ministers on the Council of Europe are set to ratify a
convention on counterfeit medicines in Istanbul this November.

 * Confidential WTO ruling expected on Friday
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. technology companies
hope a preliminary World Trade Organization ruling expected on
Friday will persuade the European Union to drop tariffs on
three products at the center of the dispute.
 John Neuffer, vice president for global policy at the
Information Technology Industry Council, said he was optimistic
the WTO panel will agree that EU duties on flat-panel displays,
multifunction printers and TV set-top boxes violated terms of
the WTO's Information Technology Agreement.
 ""The primary purpose of the case is not just the three
products that are under consideration, but to preserve the
ITA,"" which starting in 1997 eliminated tariffs on most
information technology products, Neuffer said.
 The United States, Japan and Taiwan complained to the WTO
in 2008 that EU customs authorities had reimposed tariffs on
the three products after new features were added, such as hard
drives to allow settop boxes to record TV shows.
 Because information technology products are constantly
being upgraded, eventually nothing would be covered by the pact
using that standard, industry groups argued.
 The EU imported about $11 billion worth of the three
products from all suppliers in 2007, in many cases collecting
tariffs of 6 to 14 percent.
 The preliminary ruling is confidential and both EU and U.S.
officials have said they would not comment until the final
report becomes public later this year.
 Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, the
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Costa Rica,
Singapore, and Turkey have also signaled their interest in the
the case by reserving their third-party rights at the WTO.
 ""I think there is increasing recognition that the EC has
been on the wrong side,"" said David Weller, a partner with
WilmerHale who has represented U.S. industry in the case.
 The European Court of Justice, in two recent cases
involving tariffs on flat panel displays and multifunction
printers, ""found the commission was taking an overly narrow
interpretation,"" Weller said.
 The WTO challenge also appears to have discouraged EU
customs authorities from impose tariffs on additional
information technology products, Neuffer said.
 One exception was an attempt last year to slap duties on
smart phones, but that was turned back by stiff opposition from
Nordic EU members, he said.

 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied more

and solid demand for Spanish government bonds eased European
debt concerns.
 China said its exports jumped 50 percent in May from a year
ago, reassuring investors about the path of the global economic
recovery despite the euro-zone debt crisis. Europe is China's
biggest overseas market. For details, see [ID:nTOE65901X].
 Commodities prices surged, with crude oil and copper rising
as the Chinese export data instilled confidence in demand.
China is the world's top base metals consumer and the world's
second-biggest oil consumer.
 ""If China does not slow down then the world doesn't slow
down,"" said Keith Springer, president of Capital Financial
Advisory Services in Sacramento, California. ""Everything hinges

 The major U.S. stock indexes rose nearly 3 percent on
Thursday, a day after a late-day sell-off that had reversed
strong gains in what has been a volatile month on Wall Street
amid questions over whether expectations of an economic
recovery have been overly optimistic.
 The strength in the euro helped pull European stocks from
an early slump and spilled over to the United States. Movements
in U.S. stocks have been closely tied to swings in the euro as
investors use the currency as a barometer for confidence in the
euro-zone economy.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> and the
Thomson Reuters Equity Global Index <.TRXFLDGLPU> both rose
about 2.3 percent.

 U.S.-traded shares of oil company BP Plc  rebounded
12.3 percent, a day after plunging nearly 16 percent on
mounting fears about how the company will cope with the massive
costs of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
 In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
closed up 1.57 percent at 1,014.14 points.
 Mining shares rose as the Australian government was said to

 The Australian government is due to soon announce major
changes to its controversial mining tax, a newspaper said on
Thursday, boosting shares of mining stocks in London.
 BP's London shares  declined 6.65 percent to 366

 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed 1.1 percent higher.
 FIRMING EURO
 The euro, drubbed in recent days on concern that investors
may balk at funding debt-laden European nations, rose after
signs of strong demand at the Spanish bond auction. The
currency hit its high for the day as the European Central Bank
said its government bond purchase program should not be viewed
as a change to monetary policy.
 The euro  rose 1.18 percent to $1.2126 from a
previous session close of $1.1985. It had sunk below $1.19 on
Monday, to its lowest level since early 2006.
 The dollar declined against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
falling 1.01 percent to 87.01. The dollar-yen  exchange
rate was unchanged at 91.26 yen.
 Europe's common currency got an earlier boost after Dai
Xianglong, chairman of $114 billion China's National Social
Security Fund, said the euro would gradually stabilize and that
the U.S. fiscal deficit remained a big concern, tempering
safe-haven demand for the dollar. [ID:nTOE659041]
 There have been some concerns in currency markets that the
debt crisis would persuade central banks, including China's, to
cut back on their euro reserves.
 U.S. Treasury debt fell as signs of improvement in weekly
U.S. jobless insurance claims added fuel to a sell-off ahead of
a 30-year bond auction. Benchmark 10-year note yields
 rose 0.15 percentage point to 3.33 percent.
 Other U.S. data showed its trade deficit widened slightly
in April, a sign of consumer demand and modest recovery.
 In energy and commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 rose $1.10, or 1.48 percent, to settle at $75.48 per
barrel, and spot gold  fell $13.75, or 1.12 percent, to
$1216.60 an ounce. Copper  for three-months delivery on
the London Metal Exchange rose to $6,380 a tonne, versus $6,340
a tonne on Wednesday and after hitting a session high of
$6,455.

 Traders said that added to momentum that's been building
since the euro fell below $1.19 on Monday, its lowest level
since early 2006. It was last up 1.2 percent to $1.2130, headed
for its best day against the dollar in two weeks. Despite
this week's gains, the euro has lost more than 15 percent
against the dollar in 2010 and declines may resume.
 ""We tried to maintain a break below $1.20 and really
struggled. Then Trichet offered reassurance by extending
three-month funding, and now shorts are getting squeezed,"" said
Standard Chartered currency strategist Mike Moran.
 ""I don't think we've seen the bottom for the euro this year
but this latest down leg is running out of steam,"" he said.
 The ECB left interest rates on hold as expected and raised
slightly its 2010 growth forecast, though Trichet said the pace

retracement of the 2000-2008 euro rally.
 But Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Marc Chandler said
it would probably take a move above $1.25 to signal a real
sentiment shift, and Moran said good selling interest was seen
around $1.2450.
 Further technical support level for the single currency is
seen at $1.2705 while resistance will be found at $1.2854,
according to Reuters data.
 GOOD NEWS FROM SPAIN, CHINA
 The euro also rose 1.2 percent to 110.73 yen, while the

nabCapital.
 Investors were also cheered when China confirmed that
exports jumped 48.5 percent in the 12 months to May. That eased
concern that Europe's debt woes would hurt the global economy.
 European and U.S. stocks rose and the growth-sensitive
Australian dollar soared 2.6 percent to $0.8495 buoyed by
strong Australian jobs data. An interest rate rise in New
Zealand lifted the kiwi 2.4 percent to $0.6866.
 The U.S. dollar eased against the yuan in the three-month
non-deliverable forward market in the aftermath of tough
remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the
Chinese currency, slipping to around 6.8080 from 6.8235
previously.
 That implies a slight yuan strength of around 0.3 percent
against the greenback over the next three months, as measured
from the Chinese central bank's spot yuan midpoint.
 NO BOND BUYING DETAILS
 Investors did not get new details from the ECB about its
program to buy euro zone government bonds, though Trichet said
the purchases would not alter the bank's monetary policy
stance.
 As of Friday, the ECB had bought 40.5 billion euros' worth
of euro zone debt, a program it began last month as selling
pressure on Spanish, Greek and other sovereign debt increased.
 The program is designed to lower countries' borrowing
costs.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2010 02:19PM ET</span>",US panel OKs duties on another China steel product," * US steel cases against China have risen in recent years
 * Two senators press for currency decision in paper case
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. trade panel gave
final approval on Thursday to combined duties of more than 200
percent on a steel wire product from China, as trade tensions
between the two countries began heating up again.
 The U.S. International Trade Commission voted 6-0 to allow
the U.S. Commerce Department to impose final anti-dumping and
countervailing duties on the imports, which climbed to $178
million in 2008 before falling to $13 million last year.
 The trade panel said there was ample evidence that U.S.
producers have been materially injured by imports of concrete
steel wire strand subsidized by the Chinese government and sold
in the United States at less than fair value.
 The vote came the same day that U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner was pressed by members of the Senate Finance
Committee to get tougher with China on issues ranging from
currency manipulation to copyright piracy.
 ""At what point will we take stronger action?,"" asked
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, who accused the Chinese
government of ""slow dancing"" the U.S. government and never
delivering on promised reforms.
 The ITC decision was a victory for U.S. companies American
Spring Wire Corp, Insteel Wire Products Company, and Sumiden
Wire Products Corp, which filed a petition last year against
for protection against unfair Chinese competition.
 The steel wire strand is primarily used in concrete
construction applications.
 U.S. steel companies have brought a number of cases against
China in recent years, covering a variety of steel products.
 Just this month, the Commerce Department has set
preliminary duties on steel drill pipe from China and final
duties on steel wire decking used in industrial rack systems
and steel grating used in industrial floors and docks.
 Meanwhile, two U.S. senators -- Charles Schumer of New York
and Sherrod Brown of Ohio -- urged Commerce Secretary Gary
Locke to quickly make a decision to investigate charges that
China is subsidizing exports by undervaluing its currency.
 U.S. coated paper producers have raised that issue in case
against China they filed last year.
 The Commerce Department has refused to investigate the
currency charge in previous countervailing duty cases. But it
has said in the coated paper case it would reexamine whether
there were legal grounds to launch such a probe.
 In their letter released on Thursday, Schumer and Brown
said they were frustrated that it has already taken the
Commerce Department three months to decide the issue.
 ""The time for delay is over. We owe it to our paper
companies and their workers to use the tools at our disposal to
ensure that trade is conducted on a fair basis, free of dumping
and huge government subsidies,"" the senators said.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2010 01:39PM ET</span>",Mexico natgas well controlled by armed group-media," MEXICO CITY, June 10 (Reuters) - An armed group has had
control of a natural gas well in northeast Mexico for two
weeks, Mexican media said, the latest sign of criminal gangs
robbing fuel from state oil monopoly Pemex.
 The armed men have been blockading the ""Gigante Uno""
liquefied natural gas well, part of the Burgos basin, in Nueva
Ciudad Guerrero near the U.S. border since May 23, the daily
Reforma reported on Thursday. They are apparently stealing
natural gas condensate from the site and the army has been
unable to get in, it said.
 Pemex declined to comment on the report, which also said
several workers at the site had been abducted.
 Mexico's northern border with the United States is a
battleground for drug cartels fighting over routes to smuggle
cocaine. Pemex has long complained about fuel theft by criminal
gangs, mainly controlled by drug traffickers.
 The state-run energy firm filed a lawsuit this week against
several companies for allegedly profiting from processing
stolen oil. It said some $300 million in condensate has been
stolen from its installations since 2006.
 At times thefts at its Burgos natural gas fields have
approached 40 percent of the condensate produced, Pemex said.
 Mexico is locked in a brutal war with drug traffickers that
has killed some 23,000 people, mainly smugglers and police,
since late 2006 and is a concern for foreign investors.
 Tapping into pipelines or storage facilities to steal oil,
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel generates a fortune for criminal
gangs, who are often aided by corrupt Pemex employees.
 Reforma said five workers from the Burgos well had been
kidnapped by the armed group. ""Families have not been asked for
a ransom, but we know they did ask the company (Pemex),""
Reforma said, quoting an unidentified source.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - World stocks rallied more
than 1 percent on Thursday and the euro rose for a third
straight day after China reported strong growth in exports and
solid demand for Spanish government bonds eased European debt
concerns.
 China said its exports jumped 50 percent in May from a year
ago, reassuring investors about the path of the global economic
recovery despite the euro-zone debt crisis. Europe is China's
biggest overseas market. For details, see [ID:nTOE65901X].
 Commodities prices surged, with crude oil and copper rising
as the Chinese export data instilled confidence in demand.
China is the world's top base metals consumer and the world's
second-biggest oil consumer.
 ""If China does not slow down then the world doesn't slow
down,"" said Keith Springer, president of Capital Financial
Advisory Services in Sacramento, California. ""Everything hinges
on China. If consumer spending can get to the levels where it
was, then we are in a new bull market.""
 The major U.S. stock indexes rose close to 2 percent on
Thursday, a day after a late-day sell-off that had reversed
strong gains in what has been a volatile month on Wall Street
amid questions over whether expectations of an economic
recovery have been overly optimistic.
 The strength in the euro helped pull European stocks from
an early slump and spilled over to the United States. Movements
in U.S. stocks have been closely tied to swings in the euro as
investors use the currency as a barometer for confidence in the
euro-zone economy.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> and the
Thomson Reuters Equity Global Index <.TRXFLDGLPU> both rose
about 1.7 percent.
 At midday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> jumped 174.73 points, or 1.77 percent, to 10,073.98. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 18.75 points, or 1.78
percent, to 1,074.44 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
climbed 33.82 points, or 1.57 percent, to 2,192.67.
 Energy shares gave one of the biggest boosts to the market,
with the S&P energy sector <.GSPE> up 3.4 percent, making it
the top percentage gainer among S&P sectors.
 Chevron Corp  provided the Dow with one of its major
boosts, rising 3.3 percent to $73.14.
 The PHLX Oil Service Sector index <.OSX> rose 4.2 percent,
with Baker Hughes Inc  up 7.6 percent to $41.28 and
Halliburton Co  gaining 5.5 percent to $23.79.
 U.S.-traded shares of oil company BP Plc  rebounded
more than 10 percent, a day after plunging nearly 16 percent on
mounting fears about how the company will cope with the massive
costs of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
 In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
closed up 1.57 percent at 1,014.14 points.
 Mining shares rose up as the Australian government was said
to be diluting its tax hike plans, and banks gained on the
robust demand in Spain's government debt auction.
 ""There's maybe a recycling out of the safe havens, with the
dollar and gold down, and a delve back into risk,"" said Joshua
Raymond, strategist at City Index in London. ""There are
expectations for markets to move gently higher.""
 The Australian government is due to soon announce major
changes to its controversial mining tax, a newspaper said on
Thursday, boosting shares of mining stocks in London.
 BP's London shares  declined 6.65 percent to 366
pence, hitting their lowest level since 1997 as they caught up
to the losses in the United States that occurred after UK
markets closed on Wednesday. See graphic on London vs U.S.
shares: http://r.reuters.com/tug39k
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed 1.1 percent higher.
 FIRMING EURO
 The euro, drubbed in recent days on concern that investors
may balk at funding debt-laden European nations, rose after
signs of strong demand at the Spanish bond auction. The
currency hit its high for the day as the European Central Bank
said its government bond purchase program should not be viewed
as a change to monetary policy.
 The euro  rose 0.87 percent at $1.2089 from a
previous session close of $1.1985.
 The dollar declined against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
falling 0.79 percent to 87.205. The dollar  fell 0.27
percent to 91.01 yen.
 Europe's common currency got an earlier boost after Dai
Xianglong, chairman of $114 billion China's National Social
Security Fund, said the euro would gradually stabilize and that
the U.S. fiscal deficit remained a big concern, tempering
safe-haven demand for the dollar. [ID:nTOE659041]
 There have been some concerns in currency markets that the
debt crisis would persuade central banks, including China's, to
cut back on their euro reserves.
 U.S. Treasury debt fell as signs of improvement in weekly
U.S. jobless insurance claims added fuel to a sell-off ahead of
a 30-year bond auction. Benchmark 10-year note yields
 rose to 3.26 percent.
 Other U.S. data showed its trade deficit widened slightly
in April, a sign of consumer demand and modest recovery.
 In energy and commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 rose 88 cents, or 1.18 percent, to $75.26 per barrel,
and gold  fell $7.75, or 0.63 percent, to $1222.60 an
ounce. Copper  for three-months delivery on the London
Metal Exchange rose to $6,390 a tonne, versus $6,340 a tonne on
Wednesday and after hitting a session high of $6,455.

 By John McCrank
 TORONTO, June 10 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar rose to its
highest point against the greenback in more than three weeks
on Thursday after a bullish report on Chinese exports in May
increased hopes for global economic recovery and pushed up
commodity prices.
 Chinese exports surged 48.5 percent in May over a year
earlier, well above forecasts for a 32 percent gain, confirming
a Reuters report from Wednesday. [ID:nTOE65901X]
 ""On the back of that, we saw commodity prices rise with oil
up (around) $75 a barrel,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. [ID:nSGE659083]
 Canada is a major exporter of commodities and is the
biggest oil supplier to the United States.
 ""So the Canadian dollar is benefiting from that as well as
the general move out of the U.S. dollar,"" Strauss said.
 He added that the Canadian dollar was outperforming the yen
and the greenback, both of which are seen as safe-haven
currencies, where investors seek refuge when the economic mood
sours.
 At 12:10 p.m. the Canadian dollar was at C$1.0344 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.67 U.S. cents, up from Wednesday's North
American finish of C$1.0443 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.76 U.S.
cents. It was the currency's highest level since May 18.
 The Canadian dollar was trading one-for-one with the
greenback through much of April as the global economy appeared
to be on the mend and Canada's economic fundamentals looked the
strongest in the G8.
 But the sovereign debt situation in Europe put a heavy dose
of fear back into the markets, pushing up the U.S. dollar and
sending commodity prices lower.
 As a result, the Canadian dollar hit a low of C$1.0851, or
92.16 U.S. cents, on May 25, but has been slowly gaining ground
as the concerns about Europe eased and the global recovery was
seen as gaining momentum.
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney told reporters after a
speech in Montreal on Thursday that it was too early to gauge
how recent euro zone concerns might affect Canada's economy.
[ID:nN10199122] [nN10517170]
 In his speech, he urged the G20 to push ahead quickly with
""radical"" financial reforms but signaled flexibility on when
new global banking rules would be phased in.
 ""His comments are really not off target with respect to
what we've heard not only from him, his department, as well as
(U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben) Bernanke,"" said Jack Spitz,
managing director of foreign exchange at National Bank
Financial.
 Elsewhere on Thursday, a robust employment report out of
Australia helped cheer market sentiment, as did a move by New
Zealand's central bank to lift interest rates from a record
low, its first hike since the global economic crisis.
[ID:nSGE6580KR] [ID:nSGE65904N]
 Spitz added that better than expected data in Sweden, a
solid bid on a Spanish three-year bond auction, and comments
from China on betting on a rise in the euro, added to the
bullish market environment.
 That helped push the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> up
more than 2 percent and the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX
composite index <.GSPTSE> up more than 1 percent.
 ""So, for the moment at least, the market is benefiting from
a 'risk on' sentiment, but that's something that could change
quite fast and quite easily,"" Spitz said.
 CANADIAN BOND PRICES FALL
 Canadian bond prices were lower across the curve as the
rise in stock markets cooled investors' demand for the safety
of government debt.
 The two-year government bond  fell 14 Canadian
cents to yield 1.794 percent, while the 10-year bond
 fell 45 Canadian cents to yield 3.408 percent.
 On the domestic data front, Canada recorded a smaller than
expected trade surplus in April due to the strong Canadian
dollar. [ID:nN10210970]
 Other numbers showed continued strength in Canada's housing
sector, with new home prices up for a 10th consecutive month,
but the pace is expected to cool in the second half of the year
as new taxes take a toll.
 Neither report is usually considered a market mover.

to open European Union markets fully to Palestinian exports in
the coming months to help strengthen the Palestinian economy,
the EU trade chief said on Thursday.
 The 27-country bloc has an agreement with the Palestinian
Authority that allows Palestinian industrial goods duty-free
access to the EU, and requires the Palestinian territories to
phase out tariffs on EU exports over five years.
 The EU decision to accelerate bilateral trade was announced
after a meeting between EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht and
Palestinian Economy Minister Hasan Abu-Libdeh.
 ""The European Commission is expected to propose granting
duty-free, quota-free access for Palestinian exports to the EU
in the coming months. It would help to revamp the private
sector,"" De Gucht said in a statement.
 Palestinian trade with the EU was worth 71 million euros
($85.5 million) in 2008, less than a fifth of the EU's aid
programme for the territories that year, making the Palestinian
Authority the bloc's smallest trading partner.
 Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip, which together with
the West Bank makes up the Palestinian territories, have
worsened in the past three years under the weight of an Israeli
blockade of the small enclave.
 The United States said on Wednesday it would provide almost
$400 million in new aid to the Palestinians, including funding
projects to increase private sector competitiveness and improve
infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.
 De Gucht said the European Union continued to back the
Palestinian territories' bid to become an observer to the World
Trade Organisation, which would allow it to become part of the
multilateral trading system.

 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday for
a third straight day as strong demand for Spanish bonds eased
concern about the country's ability to finance its debt and a
spike in Chinese exports boosted confidence on global growth.
 Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said three-month
emergency loans to banks would continue until September and
when Germany's high court rejected efforts to block German
guarantees for euro zone financial aid.
 Traders said that added to momentum that's been building
since the euro fell below $1.19 on Monday, its lowest level
since early 2006. It was last up 1.1 percent to $1.2114, headed
for its best day against the dollar in two weeks.
 The euro has lost 15.5 percent against the dollar in 2010.
 ""We tried to maintain a break below $1.20 and really
struggled. Then Trichet offered reassurance by extending
three-month funding, and now shorts are getting squeezed,"" said
Standard Chartered currency strategist Mike Moran. ""I don't
think we've seen the bottom for the euro this year, but this
latest down leg is running out of steam.""
 The ECB left interest rates on hold as expected and raised
slightly its 2010 growth forecast, though Trichet said the pace
of growth would be uneven in coming quarters.
 Technical analysts said the euro's downward trend would
come into question on a move above $1.2135, the 50 percent
retracement of the 2000-2008 euro rally.
 But Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Marc Chandler said
it would probably take a move above $1.25 to signal a real
sentiment shift, and Moran said good selling interest was seen
around $1.2450.
 GOOD NEWS FROM SPAIN, CHINA
 The euro also rose 1 percent to 110.55 yen, while the
dollar was flat at 91.26 yen.
 Sterling rose 0.8 percent to $1.4660. Earlier, the Bank of
England left interest rates at a record low ahead of the
government's June 22 budget, which will detail the
belt-tightening the UK faces as it tries to cut its deficit.
 Solid demand at a Spanish auction also eased concern and
cemented support for the euro. The amount of bonds sold came in
at the top of the expected range, even though they were sold at
a premium compared to a similar issue in April.
 The auction ""adds to the story that the euro may be due a
bit of a bounce as it has come a long way down in a relatively
short space of time,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
nabCapital.
 Investors were also cheered when China confirmed that
exports jumped 48.5 percent in the 12 months to May. That eased
concern that Europe's debt woes would hurt the global economy.
 European and U.S. stocks rose and the growth-sensitive
Australian dollar soared 2.2 percent to $0.8476, buoyed by
strong Australian jobs data. An interest rate rise in New
Zealand lifted the kiwi dollar 2.1 percent to $0.6849.
 ECB THIN ON BOND BUYING DETAILS
 Investors did not get new details from the European Central
Bank about its program to buy euro zone government bonds,
though Trichet said the purchases would not alter the bank's
monetary policy stance.
 As of Friday, the ECB had bought 40.5 billion euros worth
of euro zone debt, a program it began last month as selling
pressure on Spanish, Greek and other sovereign debt increased.
The program is designed to lower countries' borrowing costs.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - World stocks climbed
on Thursday with Wall Street rallying and the euro rising after
China reported solid export data and Spain successfully tapped
bond markets, easing European debt concerns.
 The European Central Bank and Bank of England both kept
interest rates unchanged, as expected.
 China confirmed that exports jumped 50 percent in May from
a year ago, reassuring investors about the global economy in
the face of the euro-zone debt crisis. Europe is China's
biggest overseas market. For details, see [ID:nTOE65901X]
 In the United States, a moderate economic recovery appeared
underway as the trade deficit widened slightly in April and the
number of U.S. workers filing new unemployment claims fell,
albeit less than expected. [ID:n09208728]
 ""The reaction to the China data was a fairly nice bounce in
the euro overnight,"" said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist
at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. That led to a
movement up in European stocks that spilled over to the United
States, he said.
 U.S, stocks have been closely tied to the movement in the
euro as investors use the currency as a barometer for
confidence in the euro-zone economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 205.07
points, or 2.07 percent, to 10,104.32. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 20.74 points, or 1.96 percent, to
1,076.43 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 37.23
points, or 1.72 percent, to 2,196.08.
 European shares shrugged off losses after the rise in
Chinese exports, which ran counter to persistent fears the
global economy was faltering.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> rose 1.4 percent, extending
gains as New York trading began. Asian stocks also gained, with
Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ending up 1.1 percent.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> and the
Thomson Reuters Equity Global Index <.TRXFLDGLPU> both rose
about 1.8 percent.
 U.S.-traded shares of oil company BP Plc  rebounded
more than 10 percent, a day after plunging nearly 16 percent on
mounting fears about how the company will cope with the massive
costs of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
The company's London shares  were down 6.1 percent to
367.7 pence, hitting their lowest level since 1997 as they
caught up to the losses in the United States that occurred
after the UK markets closed on Wednesday. See graphic on London
vs U.S. shares: http://r.reuters.com/tug39k
Several analysts said the sell-off in BP was not justified
because the company still has ample cash reserves to cover the
clean-up costs of the spill but that political pressure had
created uncertainty in the markets.
""It's tough to make price predictions on the stock, but I
think the downside risks are outweighed by the near-term upside
potential,"" said Mike Breard, analyst with Hodges Capital
Management in Dallas.
 FIRMING EURO
 The euro, drubbed in recent days on concern that investors
may balk at funding debt-laden European nations, rose after
signs of strong demand at a Spanish bond auction. The currency
hit its high for the day as the European Central Bank said its
government bond purchase program should not be viewed as a
change to monetary policy.
 The euro  rose 0.96 percent at $1.21 from a previous
session close of $1.1985.
 The dollar declined against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
falling 0.82 percent to 87.177. The dollar  rose 0.05
percent to 91.31 yen.
 Europe's common currency got an earlier boost after Dai
Xianglong, chairman of $114 billion China's National Social
Security Fund, said the euro would gradually stabilize and that
the U.S. fiscal deficit remained a big concern, tempering
safe-haven demand for the dollar. [ID:nTOE659041]
 There have been some concerns in currency markets that the
debt crisis would persuade central banks, including China's, to
cut back on their euro reserves.
 U.S. Treasuries fell as signs of improvement in weekly U.S.
jobless insurance claims added fuel to a sell-off ahead of a
30-year bond auction. Benchmark 10-year note yields 
rose to 3.26 percent.
 In energy and commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 rose $1.47, or 1.98 percent, to $75.85 per barrel, and
spot gold  fell $11.65, or 0.95 percent, to $1,218.70 an
ounce.

 By David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner on Thursday sharply criticized China's
exchange-rate policies, saying a stronger yuan was ""critically
important"" for the world economy to achieve balanced growth.
 Geithner struck his toughest tone on the yuan since
delaying a decision in early April on whether to name China a
currency manipulator in favor of a softer diplomatic
approach.
 During a sometimes heated congressional hearing, the
Treasury chief suggested his patience was wearing think in the
wait for China to let the yuan rise in value.
 ""The distortions caused by China's exchange rate spread
far beyond China's borders and are an impediment to the global
rebalancing we need,"" Geithner told the Senate Finance
Committee. ""A more flexible (yuan) will allow market forces to
play a more active role over time in facilitating strong,
balanced and sustainable growth globally.""
 U.S. lawmakers, many of whom face re-election in November,
believe an undervalued yuan is bolstering Chinese exports and
stealing U.S. jobs. With the U.S. unemployment rate hovering
just below 10 percent, many want to see China act now.
 Chinese data on Thursday showed May exports jumped 48.5
percent, although imports almost rose by nearly as big a
margin.
""America can no longer afford to be complacent. We no
longer have the luxury of pursuing failed approaches,"" the
committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat,
told Geithner.
 YUAN JUST ONE HOT TOPIC
 The currency is just one flashpoint in the difficult
U.S.-Sino relationship. Ties were strained this year over
human rights, Tibet and American weapons sales to Taiwan.
 However, Washington won Chinese support for new U.N.
sanctions on Iran and has turned to China to help rein in
North Korea after a series of provocative actions by
Pyongyang.
 Geithner defended the decision to delay the report on
currency manipulation, saying it was part of a strategy aimed
at encouraging Beijing to move soon. However, he confessed
that he didn't know when China would allow the yuan to rise.
 ""I, to be honest, do not know whether we're at the point
now when we're going to see meaningful progress in the near
term,"" he said.
 CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURE
 Geithner's assertions that the Obama administration's
strategy would encourage China to move quickly did little to
placate senators who are threatening to move forward on
punitive trade legislation.
 After a gradual rise from mid-2005 to mid-2008, the yuan
has moved in lockstep with the dollar.
 ""The level of undervaluation is back to where it was in
2005. We have not made progress,"" said Senator Charles
Schumer, the New York Democrat who has led the charge for
legislation that would slap anti-dumping penalties and
countervailing duties on goods from China.
 Schumer threatened to move forward quickly with the
legislation.
 Geithner welcomed the pressure from Schumer and others,
saying broad anti-China sentiment in the U.S. Congress might
help persuade Beijing to move.
""I'm saying that it's important for China to understand
that Congress will act if China does not act,"" he added.
 In April, Geithner said he wanted to delay the currency
report to allow time for the United States to bring pressure
to bear on Beijing at a series of high-level international
meetings, including a Group of 20 leaders summit in Toronto
later this month.
 At the time, he said he was confident that China would
find it in its own best interest to let the yuan rise in
value.
 Since April, however, the deepening of Europe's debt
crisis has severely weakened the euro, causing markets to
dampen expectations of a shift any time soon.
 Geithner said on Thursday that he would ""take stock"" of
the currency report after the G20 meeting. If the Obama
administration labeled China a ""currency manipulator,"" it
would trigger a series of negotiations involving China and the
International Monetary Fund that could lead to trade
sanctions.

* Durum quoted at 177-180 eur/T fob Seville
 * Harvest began last week, halted by rain
 By Martin Roberts 
 MADRID, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro's recent slide against
the dollar may revive sluggish sales of durum wheat, the only
cereal in which Spain has an exportable surplus, a well-known
Spanish grain broker said on Thursday.
 Luigi Vascello, one of the organizers of the annual Durum
Wheat Bourse, estimated that 400,000 tonnes of durum, which was
harvested in 2009 when the euro was up, were still unsold in
Andalusia, the hot southern region which produces most of the
country's crop.
 Vascello said that some 60,000-70,000 tonnes of durum would
be loaded on ships between June and August to execute orders.
 ""I think with the euro at $1.19 or $1.20, there are more
export opportunities in North Africa,"" he added in a telephone
interview. Spanish durum was currently quoted at 177-180 euros
($213.1-216.7) a tonne fob in Seville.
 The latest official data show Spanish durum exports fell to
188,000 tonnes between July 2009 and March 2010 from 487,000 a
year earlier.
 ""The euro-dollar factor allowed a lot of merchandise from
Canada, America and other non-EU countries to enter Europe, so
Spanish (durum) wheat was blocked for 10 months,"" said Vascello,
who organises the Bourse with the Granofil brokerage.
 The Bourse later on Thursday and on Friday will be attended
by players from Italy, Canada, Australia and Dubai, among other
countries. 
 
 QUALITY DOUBTS
 Spain's traditional clients are in Italy, which has a market
for 5.5 million tonnes of durum, and in North Africa, mainly
Algeria and Tunisia. Durum wheat can be used to make pasta or
couscous, which are staples in Italy and North Africa.
 Vascello predicted Spain would have an exportable surplus of
no more than 350,000-400,000 tonnes of durum wheat in the
2010-11 market year, which begins in July.
 Spanish farmers planted less durum last winter after they
failed to sell much of the 2009 crop, and Vascello said quality
had been uneven in the 2010 harvest, which began last week but
was rained off on Wednesday.
 ""Heavy rain in January and February caused a lot of crop
damage. There is some very good quality and some poor quality
wheat, which will go to feed -- a bit of everything,"" he said.
 ""But a week is not representative, and the harvest is not
yet widespread.""
 Vascello doubted this week's rain would cause harm but said
further downpours and damp, overcast weather could affect
quality.
 Spain's winter grains crop is likely to rise by some 9
percent from last year, a leading Spanish farmers' union has
predicted, which is less than official estimates due to the
impact of wet weather.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday for
a third straight day as strong demand for Spanish bonds eased
concern about the country's ability to finance its debt and a
spike in Chinese exports boosted confidence on global growth.
 Investors did not get new details from the European Central
Bank about its program to buy euro zone government bonds,
though President Jean-Claude Trichet said the purchases would
not alter the bank's monetary policy stance.
 ""Trichet's comments on the ECB not committing to more bond
purchases is viewed as a stepback from quantitative easing and
that's euro-positive,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The ECB left interest rates on hold as expected and raised
slightly its 2010 growth forecast, though Trichet said the pace
of growth would be uneven in coming quarters.
 The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.2096 , moving further
away from Monday's trough beneath $1.19, its lowest since 2006.
It also rose 1 percent to 110.58 yen . The U.S. dollar
was up 0.1 percent to 91.38 yen .
 As Europe's debt crisis worsened in May and selling
pressure on Spanish, Greek and other sovereign debt increased,
the ECB began buying government bonds to ease borrowing costs
for countries with troubled finances.
 As of Friday, the ECB had bought 40.5 billion euros worth
of euro zone debt, a program it began last month as selling
pressure on Spanish, Greek and other sovereign debt increased.
The program is designed to lower countries' borrowing costs.
 Analysts said solid demand at a Spanish auction eased some
concerns and cemented support for the euro. The amount of bonds
sold came in at the top of the expected range, even though they
were sold at a premium compared to a similar issue in April.
 ""(The auction) adds to the story that the euro may be due a
bit of a bounce as it has come a long way down in a relatively
short space of time,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
nabCapital.
 The euro was also helped by China confirming exports jumped
48.5 percent in May from a year earlier, which buoyed shares
and riskier currencies and eased concern that Europe's debt
woes would hurt the global economy. [ID:nTOE65605K]
 European and U.S. stocks rose and safe-haven U.S.
Treasuries fell. The growth-sensitive Australian dollar
 soared 2.2 percent to $0.8476.
 Optimism about the world economy also lifted sterling 0.7
percent to $1.4638 . Earlier, the Bank of England left
interest rates at a record low ahead of the government's June
22 budget, which will detail the belt-tighting the UK faces as
it tries to cut its deficit.

 * Euro zone more at risk of double-dip recession vs UK, U.S.
 * Economists split on if worst over in euro zone debt crisis
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - G20 finance ministers are right
to have shifted their rhetoric towards slashing deficits after
long endorsing growth-friendly but budget-busting stimulus,
according to economists polled by Reuters.
 The survey's 54 respondents also singled out the euro zone
as being more at risk of another recession than Britain and the
United States, and opinions were almost evenly split over
whether the worst of the euro zone debt crisis has passed.
 Finance ministers from the Group of 20 leading economies
reached an uneasy deal over the need for budget cuts at last
weekend's summit in South Korea. That was a marked shift from
April, when they advocated more time to allow unprecedented
growth-boosting spending to do its work.
 Forty-four out of the 50 economists who gave a view on this
agreed it was the right time for such a shift, but some
questioned whether this was in reaction to improved economic
fundamentals or panic in financial markets over red ink.
 ""It is clear to me that the G20 was forced to change tack
under pressure from the debt markets,"" said Kenneth Broux at
Lloyds Banking Group in London.
 ""Though a turn in policy had already been underway in the
European Union and the UK, there is no indication that other
countries like the U.S. will follow,"" he added, noting it was
clear that countries appeared to be going their own separate
ways.
 The world's richest economies largely escaped their worst
recessions since World War Two last year but their recoveries
have been listless and fragile compared with resurgent emerging
market peers like China and India.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner last week stressed
the need for ""European surplus countries"" to boost domestic
demand, which would lessen their reliance on cheap exports that
undercut rivals like the United States.
 But faced with a plummeting euro currency and growing
speculation about the fiscal health of peripheral members, euro
zone finance ministers nations concluded that holding off budget
cuts for domestic demand to improve was not an option.
 The euro has plunged 16 percent against the dollar this year
and over 7 percent since the start of May, despite the EU and
International Monetary Fund unleashing a $1 trillion safety net
around euro zone countries that was designed to restore market
confidence.

 RECESSION RELAPSE?
 Some economists and left-leaning political parties have
argued that a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus now risks killing
off economic recovery and a return to recession -- a scenario
the G20 finance ministers pledged to avert.
 Analysts gave a 30 percent chance of a so-called
""double-dip"" return to recession in the case of the 16-nation
euro zone, 25 percent for the UK and 20 percent for the U.S.
 ""The austerity measures that are being implemented across
the euro zone are likely to push some of the peripheral
economies back into recession,"" said David Page of Investec.
 But he added that the ""core"" euro zone members like France
and Germany are still showing decent momentum and the euro's
weakness should further help the bloc at large.
 The euro zone economy expanded 0.2 percent in the first
quarter of this year and economists polled by Reuters last month
do not expect growth to exceed 0.5 percent in any quarter
through to the end of next year.
 A devalued currency will likewise help exporters in Britain,
while the U.S. economy has been growing more robustly than its
European peers, even if it too faces formidable debt problems.
 But the fate of all these economies depends to some extent
depends on how the euro zone debt crisis evolves.
 Out of 52 economists, exactly half said the worst of it had
passed. Some said the emergency measures taken by the EU and
European Central Bank would lessen the risk of further problems,
but many still had significant doubts.
 ""Markets are not satisfied with any measure taken in Europe,
it is difficult to see what will convince them that the
fundamentals are not so negative,"" said Miguel Jimenez at BBVA.
 ""Uncertainty will remain over the coming months.""

 TORONTO, June 10 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar rose to its
highest point in over three weeks against the greenback on
Thursday after a stellar report for Chinese exports in May,
increasing hopes for the global economic recovery and giving a
bid to commodity prices.

 ""On the back of that, we saw commodity prices rise with oil

 Canada is a major exporter of commodities and is the

 ""So the Canadian dollar is benefiting from that as well as
the general move out of the U.S. dollar,"" said Strauss.
 He added that the Canadian dollar was outperforming the yen

sours.
 At 8:40 a.m. the Canadian dollar was at C$1.0350 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.62 U.S. cents, up from Wednesday's North
American finish of C$1.0443 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.76 U.S.
cents. It was the currency's strongest level since May 18.
 The currency was trading one-for-one with the greenback
through much of April as the global economy appeared to be on
the mend and on the back of Canada's strong economic
fundamentals -- seen to be the strongest in the G8.
 But the sovereign debt situation in Europe put a healthy
dose of fear back into the markets, giving a bid to the U.S.
dollar and sending commodity prices lower.
 As a result, Canada's dollar hit a low of C$1.0851, or
92.16 U.S. cents, on May 25, but has been slowly been gaining
ground as the concerns out of Europe eased and the global
recovery was seen gaining momentum.

 * Farmers seen seeking to invest in alternatives
 * Farmers group want an export pool, approval for biofuels
 
 By Olivia Kumwenda
 JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Reuters) - South African farmers may
cut investment in maize production if the country fails to
secure export markets for a surplus of grain that is depressing
prices, an industry official said on Thursday.
 South Africa, the continent's largest producer of maize,
this year expects to harvest the largest crop since the record
14.42 million tonnes crop reaped in the 1981/82 season, which is
seen affecting maize prices in Africa's biggest economy.
 Kobus Laubscher, chief executive officer of farmers' group
Grain SA, said the lower prices and higher input costs would
hurt farmers' ability to service debts and re-invest.
 ""The current price is about 1,050 rand ($135.4) per tonne
and it's falling, but the cost of production can be as high as
1,200-1,500 rand per tonne, that gives you an idea of the
shortfall farmers are facing,"" Laubscher told Reuters.
 ""If we do not prevent the further decline in producer
prices, it might impact on our future capacity to produce enough
because farmers will put capital in other production
possibilities.""
 The government's Crop Estimates Committee last month raised
its forecast for its largest maize crop in nearly three decades
to 13.317 million tonnes but said heavy rains had prevented a
still higher estimate.
 South Africa consumes 8-9 million tonnes of the staple each
year.
 Traders have said forecasts that it will export 2.5-4
million tonnes of maize may be revised due to low demand in
Southern Africa after some countries said their 2009/10 season
output will be high as well.
 
 EXPORT MARKETS WITHER
 Most southern African countries, including Malawi and
Zambia, are expected to record bumper maize harvests this year
and say they plan to export the surplus grain, limiting the
scope of export markets for South Africa.
 The government said in April it had secured foreign markets
to sell the surplus maize to safeguard the maize prices for
local farmers.
 ""We are in continuance talks with government to explore
export markets ... but the international markets are also under
pressure because of high supply and low demand, we will have to
compete with other countries,"" Laubscher said.
 Grain SA said on Tuesday it planned to apply for exemption
to the country's competition authority to allow farmers to
reserve the surplus grain for export.
 The current legislation does not allow for the establishment
of an export pool for the grain.
 ""We are convinced that the export pool could be seen as a
possible remedy to stabilise the market and to bring relief on
the price side,"" Laubscher said.
 Laubscher also said the group will continue lobbying
government to allow the use of maize in biofuels production in
order to make cultivation profitable.
 The government unveiled blending ratios for biofuels three
years ago but said maize could not be used in the production of
biofuels in order to ensure security of food supplies and keep a
lid on high prices.
 ""We are more than willing and able to produce more than what
is needed for food security in South Africa,"" Laubscher said.

widened slightly in April, as weaker foreign demand hurt U.S.
exports and oil prices jumped to their highest since October
2008, a U.S. government report showed on Thursday.
 The trade gap was $40.3 billion in April, about unchanged
from a revised estimate of $40.0 billion for March.
 Wall Street analysts before the report had expected the
trade gap to widen to around $41.0 billion, from the previously
reported March figure of $40.4 billion.
 Exports fell 0.7 percent in April to $148.8 billion after a
big jump in March. Exports have risen most months since hitting
a trough of $124.1 billion in April 2009, when world trade was
still reeling from the effects of the global financial crisis.
 Imports, which also have risen over the past year as global

 * ECB in focus; traders await comments from Trichet
 * Options keep euro within $1.20-$1.21 range
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday as
strong demand at a Spanish bond auction eased concerns about how
Spain will fund its large debt, while investors awaited a
European Central Bank news conference.
 Peripheral euro zone government bond yield spreads over
German benchmarks narrowed after Madrid's auction of three-year
bonds, prodding the euro higher. Widening spreads in recent days
have weighed on the single currency. [ID:nLDE6581SK]
 Traders said market participants were wary of taking on
significant long euro positions, with option expiries at $1.20
and $1.21 later in the day also helping to confine the single
currency within a $1.20-$1.21 range.
 Investors are looking for ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
to explain the central bank's government bond-buying programme
when at a 1230 GMT news conference. The ECB earlier held
interest rates at a record low 1.0 percent.
 ""Trichet is likely to emphasise that peripheral bond
purchases are all about providing liquidity in dysfunctional
markets, rather than quantitative easing,"" said Adam Cole,
global head of currency strategy at RBC.
 He added that assurances the plan would be reversed as soon
as liquidity improves may further support the euro, given that a
build-up in short positions in the single currency had increased
the need for investors to trim those positions.
 Investors will also look for hints to whether the ECB will
offer extra funds to banks to ease strains from the euro zone
debt crisis. [ID:nLDE6560K2]
 At 1146 GMT, the euro was up roughly half a percent on the
day against the dollar  at $1.2040, treading above $1.1876
hit on Monday for the first time in more than four years.
 Traders said investors were selling on rallies towards
$1.21, but a break above $1.21 could see the euro extend gains.
 Analysts said solid demand at the Spanish auction had
cemented support for the euro. The amount of bonds sold came in
at the top of the expected range, even though they were sold at
a premium above a similar issue in April.
 ""(The auction) adds to the story that the euro may be due a
bit of a bounce as it has come a long way down in a relatively
short space of time,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
nabCapital.
 
 TECHNICAL RESISTANCE
 But technical analysts said the euro's downward trend would
remain intact barring a move above $1.2135, the 50 percent
retracement of the 2000-2008 euro rally. 
 Debt problems in several euro zone countries, coupled with
worry about the euro's future, have caused the currency to fall
around 16 percent against the dollar this year.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.3 percent to 109.73 yen
. The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 91.20 yen ,
staying above its 200-day moving average at 90.90 yen.
 Earlier, Dai Xianglong, chairman of $114 billion China's
National Social Security Fund, said the euro would gradually
stabilise, relieving some in the market who have fretted that
the euro zone debt crisis could prompt central banks, including
China's, to cut their euro reserves. [ID:nTOE659041]
 The euro was also helped by China confirming exports jumped
48.5 percent in May from a year earlier, which buoyed shares and
riskier currencies. [ID:nTOE65605K]
 The Australian dollar rose 1.7 percent against the U.S.
dollar , buoyed by strong Australian jobs data, while a
rate rise in New Zealand dollar lifted the Kiwi 1.5 percent

113,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2010 09:27AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-EU 440 bln eur safety net no debt crisis panacea - S&P," By Nick Edwards
VIENNA, June 10 (Reuters) - The European Union's 440 billion
euro safety net for debt-ridden euro zone states unable to
access capital markets does not solve the bloc's borrowing
problems, Standard & Poor's head of European sovereign ratings
said.
 ""We would view the SPV, the stabilization fund, similar to
the way we view IMF programmes - this is not the solution,""
Moritz Kraemer told Reuters Insider TV on Thursday.
 ""If you have a problem of over-indebtedness, getting
additional debt - whether it comes from the market or the
European partners or the IMF -- is not the solution, obviously.
If you've got too much debt, more debt is not the solution.""
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 To see the full interview, click on:
 http://link.reuters.com/sem39
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Too many details of the SPV's structure remain unanswered to
get a clear idea yet of whether the vehicle will achieve the AAA
rating that EU finance ministers said this week they were hoping
for.
 ""We would need to see for example what are the processes of
those guarantees to be paid out, where does it sit - if there
were to be a default in the euro zone, which we do not really
anticipate if you look at our ratings - but if it were to
happen, how quickly would those guarantees be paid in?"" Kraemer
said.
 ""There are a lot of procedural issues that we need to
understand better,"" he added.
 But the safety net, ratified by EU finance ministers earlier
this week, does allow Greece and other euro zone members, the
breathing space to sort out their finances without being
punished daily by investors, Kraemer said.
 Speaking on the sidelines of the Institute of International
Finance's spring meeting in Vienna, Kraemer said market
psychology towards the region was currently much more
pessimistic than the ratings agencies were.
 ""What we observe this year is that investors are treating
Greece much more pessimistically from the beginning of the year
than we have, even now, after the relatively stark downgrade a
few weeks ago,"" he said, adding that S&P ratings do not
currently anticipate the likelihood of a euro zone default.
 S&P downgraded Greek debt to junk status towards the end of
April and also cut ratings for Spain and Portugal.
 But investor risk aversion means there are no short cuts
left for Europe to resolve its fiscal problems, making the SPV
only a means to an end and not the end in itself, Kraemer said.
 Fundamentally, the SPV will not necessarily underpin euro
zone sovereign ratings and it could create a contingent
liability problem in future.
 In terms of S&P's view of the credit impact on the
guaranteeing governments, ""right now ... the overall size of the
package and what's been dispersed is not of a magnitude that it
does, by itself, threaten some AAA-rated sovereigns.
 ""But it is a contingent liability and the contingent
liability is potentially growing in size quite considerably
going forward.""
 Asked specifically if that meant Germany's credit rating
would be at risk if big claims were made against the euro zone
SPV, Kraemer said not.
 ""If you just look at the sheer size of the German government
debt and its obligation under the Greek package, I would be hard
pressed to come up with an argument as to why this particular
case would lead to a weakening of Germany's debt profile or
creditworthiness,"" he said.
 But governments and investors must stay mindful that the SPV
does not cut absolute levels of debt. 
 ""In the longer term it is very clear ... that taxpayers in
France, in Germany, the Netherlands and across the euro zone
will not be able to roll over the debt of the weaker sovereigns
for an extended period of time,"" Kraemer said.
 ""I think it is financially, but first of all politically,
inconceivable.""

 * BP still under pressure
 * Euro boosted by China comment
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 10 (Reuters) - World stocks turned positive on
Thursday with Wall Street looking set to open with strong gains
while the euro rose, in part on supportive comments from the
influential head of China's national pension fund.
 The European Central Bank and Bank of England both kept
interest rates unchanged, as expected.
 European shares shrugged off earlier losses and joined in a
global rally aided by a near 50 percent surge in Chinese exports
in May, data that ran counter to persistent fears the global
economy was starting to falter amid euro zone debt woes.
 That helped Asian stocks gain with Japan's Nikkei <.N225>
ending up 1.1 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up 0.5
percent.
 Overall, MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
up 0.3 percent and the Thomson Reuters Equity Global Index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> rose 0.6 percent.
 BP <.BP.L> remained under pressure. U.S. officials are
pushing the firm to forego their dividend because of the likely
costs associated with the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico.
 The company is a heavyweight in European indexes. It
represented more than 8 percent of the FTSE 100 <.FTSE) in
mid-April, before recent losses. [ID:nLDE6590BK]
 The BP share price was down 5 percent, having earlier lost
more than 10 percent on the day.
 ""BP is such a big player and is really causing jitters
across Europe,"" said Will Hedden, sales trader at IG Index.
 
 FIRMING EURO
 The euro got a boost when the head of China's national
pension fund said the currency would weather Europe's debt
crisis.
 Dai Xianglong, chairman of $114 billion China's National
Social Security Fund, said the euro would gradually stabilise
and that the U.S. fiscal deficit remained a big concern,
tempering safe-haven demand for the dollar. [ID:nTOE659041]
 The comments helped lift the euro back above $1.20 .
There have been some concerns on currency markets that the debt
crisis would persuade central banks including China's to cut
back on their euro reserves.
 Dai is a former governor of China's central bank.
 The euro was up half a percent against the dollar  at
$1.2041. It has risen about 1.5 percent since hitting a
four-year low of $1.1876 on trading platform EBS on Monday.
 Euro zone bond yields were slightly higher.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, June 9 (Reuters) - The euro remained fragile on
Wednesday, although it held above a recent four-year low on the
dollar, and higher-risk currencies such as the Australian dollar
gave back gains as Asian share markets fell.
 The euro also remained near an all-time trough against the
Swiss franc, set on Tuesday below 1.38 francs, with the Swiss
National Bank declining comment on whether it intervened to
weaken the franc.
 European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet speaks later
in the day ahead of an ECB meeting on Thursday which the market
will watch for more signals or steps to ease strains from the
euro zone's debt crisis or support the economy.
 German 10-year bond yields fell to a record low on Tuesday as
investors sought the safety of the euro zone benchmark paper on
continued worries about fiscal woes in euro zone countries and
Britain, after a warning to the UK from ratings agency Fitch.
 ""Despite the substantial (euro zone) policy package and the
details we have got on that, European bond markets continue to
show signs of stress and that suggests the euro can fall further
from here,"" said John Horner, FX strategist Deutsche Bank in
Sydney.
 The euro slipped to $1.1945, down 0.3 percent from New York
trading levels but above Monday's four-year low of $1.1876.
 Chart focuses for the market are expected options triggers
around $1.1850 and a low set in early 2006 at about $1.1825.
Horner said Deutsche Bank expected the euro to slide to $1.15
over the coming few months.
 The euro slipped 0.4 percent from late U.S. levels to 109.10
yen after gaining 0.5 percent on Tuesday.
 The Australian dollar, which bounced more than 2 percent
against the yen in the previous session, fell 0.7 percent to
75.16 yen, its losses deepening as Asian share markest opened and
headed lower.
 The Aussie also lost ground to the U.S. dollar after climbing
more than 2 percent on Tuesday. It slipped 0.3 percent to
$0.8230.
 The U.S. dollar index, a measure of its performance against
six other major currencies, slid 0.2 percent to 88.261, below a
15-month peak of 88.708 on Monday.
 The dollar eased 0.2 percent to 91.30 yen.

 By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday as
investors booked profits a day after the currency hit its
lowest level against the dollar since early 2006, and the pound
fell after a ratings agency urged Britain to cut its deficit.
 The euro also hit an all-time trough below 1.38 Swiss
francs but rebounded sharply, with traders citing Swiss
National Bank intervention to weaken the franc. The SNB
declined to comment. For details, see [ID:nWEA5363].
 Against the dollar, the euro rose above $1.20 after
tumbling to $1.1876 on Monday, its lowest level since March
2006. But analysts said the market was still anxious about debt
levels in several euro zone countries and debt auctions this
week from Portugal and Spain.
 ""The euro decline isn't over,"" said Marc Chandler, senior
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""There are
supply concerns this week, and what we're seeing now is a brief
respite. A rise above $1.20 would be a good chance to sell.""
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro was up 0.4
percent at $1.1954  after hitting a session peak at
$1.2008, according to Reuters data. Analysts said it also saw
support after euro zone ministers made final arrangements
Monday to set up funds for countries facing debt problems. It
was up 0.3 percent at 109.15 yen .
 The euro has shed more than 16 percent against the dollar
this year, and some economists worry this will hurt U.S.
exports to the euro zone, a fear Chicago Federal Reserve
President Charles Evans downplayed on Tuesday. [ID:nN08177384]
 SWISS SPECULATION, UK DEBT WORRIES
 The euro's abrupt rebound from a low against the Swiss
franc earlier spurred talk of intervention by the Swiss
National Bank.

 Englander sees the euro between $1.10 and $1.15 over the
next one to three months. However, a weaker euro would help to
offset slower growth in euro zone countries such as Greece and
Spain, which will eventually help the currency recover.
 In the long run, ""I think time is on the side of the euro,""
he said, provided countries stick to austerity budgets.

 * Says sound public finances and welfare measures come first
 * Says new euro vote in Sweden highly unlikely in coming yrs
 
 By Johan Sennero and Niklas Pollard
 STOCKHOLM, June 8 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik
Reinfeldt said on Tuesday income taxes could be cut further if
his centre-right coalition is re-elected in September, but
securing public finances and the welfare state would come first.
 Reinfeldt also said in a Reuters interview that the debt
crisis engulfing parts of Europe had pushed the issue of Swedish
euro adoption ""into the future"" and all but ruled out a new
referendum being held during the coming four years.
 The overriding priorities are returning Swedish public
finances to surplus during the coming four-year term and shoring
up the welfare state in areas such as education, Reinfeldt said.
 ""I can also consider a further easing of taxes to encourage
work, and in that case we are looking at a further income tax
cut,"" he said. ""To the extent there exists room for reform
measures, it is during the latter part of the term of office.""
 Sweden, compared to the rest of Europe, already has enviable
public finances. The European Commission has forecast Sweden to
have a 2.1 percent public deficit this year as a share of the
economy, the lowest in the bloc.
 Reinfeldt's alliance ended a decade of Social Democrat rule
in 2006, pledging to cut taxes and scale back welfare benefits
but otherwise preserve Sweden's cherished social safety net.
 The opposition Social Democrats, which ruled Sweden for most
of the post-World War Two era, have led in opinion polls for
most of the time Reinfeldt has been in power, though recent
polls show the centre-right retaking the lead. [ID:nLDE65309J]
 The centre-right coalition led by the Moderates carried out
four income tax cuts and was sometimes criticised for the haste
with which it sought to assert its agenda, but Reinfeldt said
the pace of reforms was likely to slacken if re-elected.
 ""I feel we were well prepared for a rapid pace of reform
during our first term in office and if we get a second one, I
predict things will be calmer in this regard,"" he said.
 ""It will be about nurturing the reforms so that they are
carried through in the way we had planned.""
 
 UNSCATHED
 The European debt crisis has left Sweden largely unscathed
and given the government scope to hint at more stimulus measures
-- in stark contrast to the austerity measures across Europe.
 Signs of recovery have spread through the Swedish economy,
which grew a brisk 1.4 percent in the first quarter after its
worst recession since World War Two last year. Still, Reinfeldt
warned Europe's debt woes could weigh. [ID:nLDE6570P8]
 ""Very many of our main markets are these countries,"" he
said, from an office overlooking parliament and the royal
palace. ""With the indications we have now things are going very
well, but we are a very open economy.

Minister, click http://link.reuters.com/qaf88k
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 Euro zone turmoil has also soured public sentiment toward
joining the currency area, a proposition soundly rejected in a
2003 referendum despite most of the centre-right coalition as
well as the Social Democrats campaigning for a 'yes' vote.
 A poll in April showed 55 percent opposed to adopting the
single currency and only 37 percent in favour. [ID:nLDE6381D1]
 ""I've always said that I have two conditions to even
consider a second referendum. The first would be that opinion
polls showed over time a great support for the euro. In that
sense, this has pushed euro question into the future,"" he said.
 ""I would also argue that we have some questions regarding,
not the euro as a political idea, but the shape of how this is
conducted economically,"" he added.
 Asked whether that meant a euro referendum was highly
unlikely during the next four-year term, Reinfeldt said: ""Yes"".

 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday as
investors booked profits a day after the currency hit its
lowest level against the dollar since early 2006, and the pound
fell after a ratings agency urged Britain to cut its deficit.
 The euro also hit an all-time trough below 1.38 Swiss

 Against the dollar, the euro rose above $1.20 after
tumbling to $1.1876 on Monday, its lowest level since March

 ""The euro decline isn't over,"" said Marc Chandler, senior

according to Reuters data. Analysts said it also saw support
after euro zone ministers made final arrangements Monday to set

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Tuesday, but worries over Europe's debt troubles
continued to dampen sentiment and European stocks dropped.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's reassuring
comments on the state of the U.S. economy helped support U.S.
stocks, but a report by Fitch Ratings that the UK faced a
""formidable"" fiscal challenge pushed European stocks to near
two-week closing lows.
 Risk-averse investors streamed into gold, sending prices
for the precious metal to a record dollar high amid fears that
euro zone credit contagion could stunt global economic growth.
 Bernanke said the U.S. economy seemed to have enough
momentum to avoid a ""double-dip"" recession, while European
leaders were committed to ensuring the survival of the euro and
had enough money to meet obligations of heavily indebted member
nations. For details, see [ID:nLDE65705B]
 Still, traders remained anxious about debt levels in
several euro zone countries, as Portugal, Italy and Spain
prepared to sell new bonds this week. It will be the first sale
by Spain since a credit ratings downgrade.
 ""Markets remain under pressure,"" said Peter Dixon, an
economist at Commerzbank. ""Until we see any indications that
uncertainty has lifted, the prospects of any decent rally in
the European markets appears distant.""
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top

 * Banks would react by reducing lending
 * Planned FX lending ban looks acceptable-Assoc chief Erdei 
 
 (Adds background, detail, analyst)
 By Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, June 8 (Reuters) - Some Hungarian banks could post
losses this year if the government goes ahead with a big special
tariff on the financial sector in its effort to raise funds for
the budget, the country's top commercial banker said on Tuesday.
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban proposed a special
bank tax, planned to siphon 200 billion forints ($1.02 bln) into
the budget from banks' coffers this year, a move that Hungarian
Banking Association chairman Tamas Erdei said would have a
""shocking effect"" on the banking sector.
 ""I'm convinced that would be such a drastic tax on the
Hungarian banking system, it would cause great harm,"" Erdei told
Reuters in an interview after the prime minister unveiled plans
of the tax on Tuesday.
 He added that the association would start immediate
negotiations with the government because some details remained
unclear, such as the proposed three-year duration of the extra
tax, and whether it would be levied on revenues or profits,
before or after corporate taxes.
 Hungary has committed to a budget deficit of 3.8 percent of
gross domestic product with international lenders, and needs to
raise funds or cut costs amounting to about 1.0-1.5 percent of
GDP to meet the deficit goal, Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy
has said.
 The new centre-right government of the Fidesz party took
office on May 29 after an election victory in April that was
based on a promise of tax cuts and job creation. 
 They have pledged to stick to the deficit target after
confusing comments last week that sent Hungary's assets tumbling
and set off global market turmoil, but scrambled to find the
extra revenue sources to keep the budget in check.
 The planned tax level of 200 billion forints compares to 306
billion in pretax profits in the sector in 2009 - most of which
came from financial operations and not the core business, which
struggled as the economy was mired in a deep recession.
 It is therefore unlikely that the banking sector would come
out of such taxation unharmed, said Norbert Harcsa, an analyst
at Ipopema Securities in Budapest.
 ""Most of last year's profits came from the bond market,""
Harcsa said. ""We can forget about further (central bank)
interest rate cuts this year, so no profits there. Plus the
interest rate margins the sector has got used to are presumably
unsustainable as well.""
 Erdei said the bank tax would reduce banks' ability and
willingness to lend at a time when they are preparing for tough
capital adequacy regulations likely to be introduced under the
Basel III criteria.
 ""Our owners will not raise capital just so we pay them as
taxes into the budget,"" he said. ""The pool of capital is set,
and each bank will see, once they paid all the dues, how much
they can maintain their lending activity, or how much they need
to cut it.""
 He said that taxes of about 30 to 40 billion forints per
year paid to the budget could be acceptable.
 He also said a planned ban on foreign currency mortgage
lending looked acceptable.
 ""The forint market is awfully volatile,"" he said. ""From this
respect (the plan) that mortgages could only be taken out in
forints is acceptable, there is no problem with that.""

 * OECD, UNCTAD to produce trade, investment reports for G20
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 8 (Reuters) - Protectionism is still a risk as
unemployment remains high in many countries despite the recovery
but it has so far not caused the serious damage that some
feared, a World Trade Organization report will argue next week.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy has been reporting since
early 2009 on trade measures by the WTO's 153 members to monitor
whether the financial crisis was leading to tit-for-tat steps
of the kind that caused the 1930s Great Depression.
 The latest report, due to be published on Monday or Tuesday
next week, will show that WTO members have taken fewer trade
measures in the last six months than in the previous period
affecting a smaller share of world trade.
 ""The basic story is that this is all under control,"" said
one trade expert.
 The report will reinforce the conclusions of previous
documents that the global trading system -- and its rules
umpired by the WTO -- has so far held up relatively well to the
stresses of the crisis.
 
 STRONG REBOUND
 Some independent economists disagree, with the Global Trade
Alert website (www.globaltradealert.org ) tracking dozens of
protectionist measures.
 But the fact remains that despite deadlock in the eight-
year-old Doha round talks to open up world trade, and continuing
lively activity at the WTO's dispute settlement body, the world
has not descended into beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism.
 Trade is rebounding strongly from the crisis, with the WTO
forecasting trade in goods will expand by nearly 10 percent this
year after contracting 12.2 percent in 2009.
 For instance, Taiwan announced on Monday that its exports in
May were 58 percent higher than a year earlier while its imports
jumped 71 percent. [ID:nTPV001624]
 Argentina and Ecuador have been pushing for the WTO to
examine the impact on trade of various bailouts and stimulus
packages carried out by rich countries, but also some emerging
nations like China, to counter the crisis.
 WTO economists have argued that such an exercise would be
extremely complex and so far the call has not been backed by the
rest of the membership.
 For instance a bailout of car companies in a country will
help that country's domestic automobile producers, arguably
distorting trade, but will also benefit their suppliers in other
countries.
 However, the report will include special sections looking at
trade measures in the automobile, steel and textile sectors,
which were particularly affected by bailouts.
 Next week's report will be accompanied by a short document
on trade measures in the G20 countries.
 This will be issued together with papers on trade and
investment in the G20 by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) prepared for the
G20 summit in Toronto on June 26-27.

 * Finance ministry says not worried about the pending check
 * Bulgaria upped its 2009 fiscal gap on hidden deficits
 
 (Adds Bulgarian finance ministry comment)
 LUXEMBOURG, June 8 (Reuters) - The European Commission is
concerned about the quality of Bulgarian statistics and wants to
send a mission there when Eurostat gets new auditing powers,
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
 European Union finance ministers granted The European
Union's statistics office Eurostat wide auditing powers on
Tuesday to help prevent another debt crisis in the EU, like the
one sparked by years of faulty Greek deficit and debt numbers.
 ""We have had some concerns as regards the statistical
performance of Bulgaria and are considering sending a mission
shortly ... which has all these audit powers,"" Rehn told a news
conference on Tuesday.
 But he noted that the European Parliament still had to
express its opinion on the ministers' decision and it will then
have to be endorsed by EU leaders, possibly on June 17, before
it comes into force.
 The Bulgarian finance ministry said it was expecting such a
mission since May, when it was forced to increase the fiscal gap
for 2009 to 3.7 percent of GDP from the 1.9 percent it reported
under EU accounting rules after revealing hidden deficits.
 ""The mission is expected...It neither surprises us, nor
worries us,"" the ministry said in a statement.
 In April, the new centre-right government revealed dozens of
unaccounted public procurement deals signed by the previous
Socialist-led cabinet. [ID:nLDE63813A]
 The hidden deficit forced Bulgaria to delay its euro zone
entry plans, and hit the credibility of the EU's poorest nation.
 The EU executive commission has started a disciplinary
action against Bulgaria, along with Cyprus, Denmark and Finland
for running budget deficits above the EU's ceiling of 3 percent
of GDP.
 The government plans to increase its 2010 budget deficit
target to 4.8 percent of GDP on a cash basis after an initial
0.7 percent, due to the prolonged recession which has slashed
tax revenues.
 Under EU rules, the 2010 fiscal deficit is expected to be
around 3.8 percent of GDP, the finance ministry said.

 A repeat of the last election in 2007 and its aftermath --

Spain over their budgetary problems.
 At an auction on Monday, investors demanded a yield of 3.523
percent to buy Belgian 10-year government bonds, a premium over
benchmark German Bunds of almost a full percentage point and
double the spread a week earlier.
 Belgian governments are made up of Dutch- and
French-speaking parties and take some time to form given each
group has a different vision on the future of the country and
the degree to which powers should be devolved to the regions.
 ""If it takes too much time, then financial markets will ask
the question, 'will this country continue to exist?'"" ING
economist Philippe Ledent said.
 Belgian bond spreads over Bunds could widen further to
around 125 basis points, economists said, if a government was
not formed by September, a deadline put forward by some parties.
 Such estimates are still modest by comparison with the
Spanish yield spread over Bunds, which has widened to over 200
bp, and the Greek-German bond spread at around 570 bp.
 Belgium's outgoing government has set a budget deficit
target of 4.8 percent of gross domestic product for 2010, well
below the EU average -- but Belgium's overall debt will rise
above 100 percent of GDP, lower only than Greece and Italy.
 Belgian central bank governor Guy Quaden warned last month
of ""dramatic"" consequences if Belgium is left with a caretaker
administration of limited power for three months or more.
 ""Our financial-economic situation and the financial markets
today are much more fragile than three years ago,"" Quaden said
in an interview with Knack magazine.
 The Federal Planning Bureau, an economic forecasting agency
for the government, says Belgium will have to cut spending by
some 42 billion euros ($50 billion) between 2010 and 2014 to
bring the deficit back below 3 percent, meeting EU rules.
 Rudi Thomaes, managing director of the Federation of Belgian
Businesses, said Belgium needed a strong government to help keep
business competitive.
 
 BELGIUM NOT NEXT GREECE
 However, economists and politicians say the country is
unlikely to break up and that Belgium is not the next Greece.
 ""We must work on the assumption that Belgium will continue
to exist,"" Dexia economist Frank Lierman said.
 Belgium was not immune to speculative movements of money, he
said, but was unlikely to become the next victim of the euro
zone's sovereign debt crisis.
 The country runs a trade surplus and household savings are
high. Its debt peaked at 134 percent of GDP in 1993, but it has
shown it can cut the burden, to 96.8 percent of GDP by the end
of 2009.
 The average maturity of Belgium's government debt, totalling
some 338 billion euros, is currently 6.4 years, the debt agency
says -- in line with a 6.5 year average for the euro zone,
according to European Central Bank figures for the end of March.
 The head of the debt agency told Reuters last month she
expects the debt to GDP ratio to drop from 2012.
 This year, the agency is planning to issue 32.75 billion
euros of OLOs (linear bonds) and a further 4.5 billion from its
euro medium term note programme. So far, the country has
achieved over 61.4 percent of this issuance.
 Since Prime Minister Yves Leterme's government collapsed in
April over a standoff between Dutch- and French-speaking
parties, spreads have not widened significantly.
 The lack of a new government and of decisive action may not
be a problem in the short term, but it could pose a serious
threat in the longer run.
 Political parties have proposed slashing government spending
by cutting back on civil servants' pay, improving tax
collection, and fighting fiscal fraud. They have also called for
raising the early retirement age to 60 from 52 currently.
 However, they need to gain power to implement such measures,
and to avoid becoming mired in crisis, unable to resolve the
issue of further devolution.
 ""It is not clear how you would reduce the deficit without a
government that can really govern, and drastic saving measures
really are required,"" Hans Bevers at KBC said.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2010 09:27AM ET</span>",Q+A-Impact of Merkel's 80 bln euro budget cut plan," By Madeline Chambers
 BERLIN, June 8 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
unveiled plans for 80 billion euros in budget cuts over the next
four years on Monday, a package of measures she hopes will help
revive her political fortunes.
 However, conservative Merkel, who rules in a centre-right
coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats, has to ensure
parliament, unions and voters accept the package. 
 For a story on the package, please double click on and for a
factbox, on. For an article by a Reuters columnist, please
double click on.
 Here are some questions and answers about the package and
where it leaves Merkel.
 DO THE FIGURES ADD UP?
 Economists welcomed the package but say the headline figure
is exaggerated. Merkel may have to water down several measures,
some of which had been planned already, to get them through.
 Economists put the actual savings at between 27 billion
euros and 33 billion euros through 2014.
 But even that will help lower Germany's deficit which was
set to exceed 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this
year, say economists. While far lower than some other euro zone
countries' deficits, that still tops the official EU cap. 
 It is unclear whether the package will ensure Germany's
structural deficit of no more than 0.35 percent of GDP by 2016,
as required in a new ""debt brake"" law. 
 Although no-one is predicting a debt crisis in Germany,
economists say her package should stave off any such threat.
 
 DOES IT RISK CHOKING OFF RECOVERY?
 Most economists were pleased the package focused on spending
cuts rather than tax rises which, they say, would have posed a
greater risk to growth. 
 Andreas Rees of Unicredit said the package might shave about
0.25 percentage points off 2011 growth and between 0.5
percentage points and 0.75 percentage points through 2014.
 In her decision to avoid taxes that would burden private
consumption, Merkel acknowledged she was partly responding to
international pressure to encourage Germans to spend more and
help boost the euro zone economy rather than rely on exports.
 Economists argue the bigger threat to the German recovery is
belt-tightening from other euro zone countries which could hit
exports in coming years.
 
 WHAT RESISTANCE WILL IT HIT?
 * Unions have promised stiff resistance. The DGB union
umbrella federation, has promised action and civil service
unions are likely to protest due to plans to cut 15,000 jobs by
2014. Industrial action looks likely but at this stage there is
little sign that it will ignite broad public anger.
 * Industry: Merkel is also likely to face stiff resistance
from airlines and energy companies due to targeted tax rises in
those sectors but it looks unlikely that firms will be able to
get out of the planned taxes altogether.
 * German voters, who tend to be thrifty due to memories of
hyperinflation and soaring unemployment in the 1920s, tend to be
more worried about inflation and job security than about saving.
To that extent, the package might not be as unpopular among the
general population as it would be in some other countries.
 
 WILL IT PASS POLITICAL HURDLES?
 The package is likely to get through the Bundestag lower
house as Merkel's centre-right coalition has a clear majority.
 However, opposition parties have vowed to fight the package,
which they say is unfair because it targets welfare spending and
especially unemployment benefits.
 A vote in the Bundesrat upper house could be more
troublesome after Merkel's coalition was robbed of its majority
there in a regional election last month. As Merkel now has to
rely on opposition party support to pass laws, she may have to
make concessions, especially on social security cuts.
 
 IS THE PACKAGE ENOUGH TO BOOST MERKEL?
 No -- not on its own. 
 If she gets her package through parliament largely
unscathed, the German recovery continues and the euro zone debt
crisis eases, both her standing within her party and her
popularity among voters is likely to bounce back somewhat. 
 But she still faces some major hurdles.
 * On June 30, a special assembly will vote for a new German
president after the shock resignation of Horst Koehler last
week. A battle between her conservative candidate, Christian
Wulff, and the opposition choice, Joachim Gauck -- a charismatic
anti-communist activist from eastern Germany -- is looming. The
special assembly is unpredictable due to its composition -- it
includes all Bundestag lower house lawmakers plus an equal
number of delegates appointed by members of the upper house.
 Some German media suggest a failure to get Wulff elected
would be a body blow to Merkel.
 * Her coalition is increasingly fractious and Merkel needs
to ensure it doesn't fall apart. FDP members are growing angry
about the government's direction. Merkel last month announced
she was ditching planned tax cuts -- the FDP's main election
promise -- due to the budget situation. 
 Last week the mood in the coalition soured further after
Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) scuppered
the FDP health minister's plans for heath reform.
 The risk for Merkel is that some in the FDP will rebel. Some
lawmakers have already said they may back Gauck for president.

(Adds Lufthansa CEO comment, airports association comment)
 BERLIN, June 8 (Reuters) - Airlines lambasted German plans
for an air travel tax on Tuesday as Europe's aviation industry
struggles to make money in a weak economic environment.
 Berlin's plans and warnings of weak European growth this
year overshadowed the closing day of airlines body IATA's annual
meeting on Tuesday, where top bosses spent three days meeting
engine suppliers, planemakers and back-office cost-cutters.
 Germany, Europe's biggest economy, intends to impose a tax
of up to 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) a year as part of a
package of budget cuts and taxes to shore up stretched public
finances.
 ""This is simply a cash grab by a cash-grab government,
painted green with no environmental benefit,"" IATA Chief
Executive Giovanni Bisignani told reporters in a briefing.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday stunned aviation
industry executives gathered at the IATA meeting and planemakers
preparing for the opening of the Berlin Air Show as she
announced the air travel tax plans, part of 80 billion euros
($107 billion) of budget measures.
 The German move comes as governments across Europe vow to
become more frugal and rein in their budget deficits to bolster
their economies against the region's debt crisis.
 It added to concern over IATA's warning that Europe's
aviation industry was recovering more slowly than expected, hit
by a volcanic ash cloud that closed airspace across a large part
of the continent in April, as well as by a weaker euro.
 ""The most vulnerable part of the industry is in Europe. The
last thing the industry here in Europe needs is additional taxes
and measures that will slow down economic growth,"" IATA Chief
Economist Brian Pearce said.
 
 BLACK DAY
 The air travel tax is seen raising prices by 8-16 euros per
ticket. Other European Union members that have introduced such a
tax include Ireland, Britain and the Netherlands.
 ""That doesn't sound like a lot, but it's more than the
collective earnings of all airlines in Germany,"" said Wolfgang
Mayrhuber, chief executive of German flagship carrier Lufthansa
, which faces the biggest burden from the proposed tax.
 The airline, which said the levy represented a ""black day""
for the industry, will take an annual hit of about 200 million
euros a year, Commerzbank analyst Frank Skodzik said, assuming
the carrier can pass on half of the tax to passengers.
 Mayrhuber said there was ""no way"" Lufthansa could pass on
the tax to customers.
 German airports body ADV warned that air traffic in Germany
could drop by as much as 3 percent as passengers seek cheaper
tickets in neighbouring countries and airlines shift their
traffic elsewhere to avoid the tax.
 Lufthansa shares closed down 2.2 percent at 10.515 euros,
while the Stoxx Europe 600 Travel & Leisure index eased 1.9
percent. Shares of Air Berlin, Germany's second-biggest airline,
fell 2.2 percent to 3.425 euros.
 The world's airlines had their worst year ever in 2009,
losing a total $9.4 billion, when demand dropped faster than
capacity could be cut as companies and consumers shrank travel
budgets to weather the global economic crisis.
 While IATA on Monday raised its 2010 earnings estimate for
the global airline industry, it cut the outlook for Europe --
the only region where it nows airlines continuing to post
overall losses this year.
 And the tax news came as Dubai airline Emirates placed a
record $11 billion order for 32 Airbus A380s in an announcement
at the Berlin airshow on Tuesday.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Tuesday,
as investors booked profits a day after the currency hit its
lowest level against the dollar since early 2006, and the pound
fell after a ratings agency urged Britain to cut its deficit.
 Euro gains were slight, though, and analysts said the
market remained anxious about debt levels in several euro zone
countries. With Portugal, Italy and Spain set to sell new bonds
this week -- the first sale for Spain since its credit ratings
downgrade -- investors were still wary of overexposure to the
euro, keeping the currency capped below $1.20.
 ""The euro decline isn't over,"" said Marc Chandler, senior
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ""There are
supply concerns this week, and what we're seeing now is a brief
respite. A rise above $1.20 would be a good chance to sell.""
 The euro was last up 0.2 percent at $1.1930, above a
session low around $1.19 and Monday's trough of $1.1876, its
lowest level against the dollar since March 2006.
 Analysts said the euro gained some support after euro zone
ministers made final arrangements on Monday to set up funds for
countries facing debt servicing problems.
 Some market participants said euro/dollar may be hemmed in
by options expiring at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).
 ""There are a big euro expiries at $1.1900, $1.1950 and
$1.2000, which could keep it in a range today,"" said a London
based sales-trader.
 SWISSIE RISES, STERLING FALLS
 The euro also skidded to a lifetime low beneath 1.38 Swiss
francs and dipped briefly below 109 yen before rebounding to
109.21 yen, up 0.3 percent. European shares also slipped.
 Switzerland's central bank has been intervening in currency
markets since early 2009 to prevent excess franc strength but
appears to have pulled back in recent days. Data Tuesday showed
it's foreign exchange reserves soared in May.
 Sterling fell 0.5 percent to $1.4402 after Fitch Ratings
said the UK was facing a ""formidable"" fiscal challenge and said
Britain's public debt ratio had climbed more quickly than those
of other top-rated sovereign credits.
 ""It's more of the contagion fear that's been gripping
markets for months now,"" said John Doyle, strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington. ""Fitch's comments on the UK deficit
are important.""
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent to 91.461 yen as new Japanese
Prime Minister Naoto Kan chose a fiscal conservative as his
finance minister. Kan has in the past advocated for a weaker
yen to help Japanese exports and fight deflation, but Chandler
said that might be wishful thinking as long as the world is in
crisis mode.
 During times of risk aversion, the yen tends to rise as
investors exit positions in riskier currencies and assets.
 Appetite for risk remained decidedly weak across markets,
particularly in Europe, where analysts noted that bond yield
spreads widened between benchmark German bunds and other
sovereign debt, including that of Spain and France.
 Strategists at Citigroup said a 200-basis-point gap between
Spanish and German 10-year bonds and a close Monday in the CBOE
Volatility Index above a key technical level suggest an
""anti-risk environment in the days ahead,"" which pressure the
euro and boost U.S. Treasury yields.

policymakers are not worried about the weaker euro and have not

 ""We are not worried about the euro and so far there has been
no discussion about intervention,"" a source Market News
described as a senior Eurosystem official was quoted as saying.
""What we've seen in the press (about intervention) is only
speculation.""
 The single European currency hovered near the four-year low
of $1.1876 it hit against the dollar on Monday and traded at
$1.1935 by 1250 GMT. It has lost about 17 percent of its value
against the dollar this year.

could raise the price of air travel by an average 8-14 euros per
ticket.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Tuesday,
reversing early gains as European shares fell, with concerns
that euro zone debt problems would stifle the region's economic
growth keeping investors averse to risky assets.
 The single European currency hovered near a four-year low
hit against the dollar on Monday. It skidded to a lifetime low
versus the Swiss franc as traders tested the resolve of the
Swiss central bank to rein in strength in the domestic currency.
 European shares reversed slight gains made early in the
session to trade nearly 1 percent lower, with investors risk
averse and that the euro vulnerable to more losses given recent
volatility.
 ""There's been a big drop in equity markets and something of
a rise in general volatility,"" said Peter Frank, currency
strategist at Societe Generale, adding worry over debt problems
in some euro zone countries were driving short-term movements.
 Analysts said the euro gained support earlier in the day
after euro zone ministers made final arrangements on Monday to
set up funds for countries facing debt servicing problems.
 But some added the ministers finalising details of a vehicle
to raise up to 440 billion euros in loans had limited impact on
the euro as it was widely expected, and that the turnaround in
stock prices had prompted the euro's retreat.
 A widening in peripheral euro zone bond yield spreads over
their safe-haven German counterparts also weighed on the euro,
analysts said.
 By 1019 GMT, the euro was unchanged on the day at $1.1920,
after pulling back from a session high of $1.1982 in earlier
trade to hit the day's low of $1.1900. Against the yen the euro
slipped 0.1 percent to 108.80 yen.
 Some market participants said the euro may be hemmed in by
options barriers around the $1.19-1.20 region due to expire
later in the day.
 On Monday, the single currency fell as low as $1.1876 on
electronic trading platform EBS, its weakest since March 2006,
while plumbing 108.06 yen, its lowest in more than eight years.
The euro has stayed on the back foot since its dramatic fall
late last week, when weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data and a
warning by Hungary that it may face Greek-style debt problems
led investors to shed risky assets.
 
 MORE EURO LOSSES?
 The euro fell to 1.3785 on EBS, as traders took a stab at
the 1.3800 francs level to see if the SNB would defend the euro
at that rate.
 Data on Tuesday showed Switzerland's currency reserves
soared in May, reflecting massive intervention by the central
bank last month even as the franc continued to climb against a
broadly weak euro.
 Analysts said the rapid rate at which the SNB has been
selling the franc was unsustainable, and that this view had
helped to push the euro lower against the Swiss currency.
 Germany's government agreed to an austerity package while
Hungary promised cuts to meet budget targets, indicating more
European countries were taking steps to decrease their deficits.
 Still, markets fret over the region's banking system and the
impact austerity will have on growth, and many investors expect
the euro to suffer more losses in the medium to longer term.
 ""The macro picture remains indicative for the euro to remain
in a downtrend, especially versus the dollar,"" UBS analysts said
in a note.
 ""The outlook for weakening global growth momentum coupled
with structural problems in Europe remaining intact does not
bode well for risk.""

 By Sandor Peto and Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, June 8 (Reuters) - Hungary's prime minister vowed
on Tuesday to introduce a flat income tax and a tariff on banks,
cut some public pay and ban foreign currency mortgages as he
strove to reassure investors he can contain the budget deficit.
 After sweeping an April election with a two-thirds majority,
Viktor Orban unveiled a programme departing from that of the
previous caretaker Socialist cabinet that cut spending last year
after narrowly avoiding economic meltdown in 2008.
 Despite warnings his centre-right Fidesz party's pro-growth
strategy could undermine Hungary's pledges to cut its budget
deficit under a 20 billion euro international aid package, Orban
said boosting jobs and output were key to economic recovery.
 Struggling to win back market confidence after Fidesz
officials rattled investors by warning of a Greek-style debt
crisis last week, Orban said he would enact a flat 16 percent
income tax over two years, effectively cutting the rate.
 He said his government would cut taxes to small and medium
firms and ban foreign currency mortgage lending. 
 Those loans have been a crucial driver of Hungary's economy
this decade, but have created a huge FX debt risk for Hungary.
 Orban signalled his government would pay for the tax cuts by
levying a new tariff on banks.
 ""We would like to start talks with the banks about what the
base of this tax would be, how the burdens would be shared by
banks, insurers and leasing companies, and we propose that we
should introduce this for 3 years,"" he said in a speech.
 Orban also vowed to freeze costs at state institutions,
reduce some state wage costs by 15 percent.
 The move would include a cut in salaries for board members
of state-owned firms, and the central bank, whose governor,
Andras Simor, Orban has clashed with and said should resign.
 
 MIXED REACTION
 Fidesz officials have shied from statements that hit global
markets last week and helped push the euro to a four-year low,
in which they said Budapest may face a similar crisis to Athens.
 Hungary's deficit and debt ratios to GDP are not as high:
public debt was about 80 percent last year, just over the EU
average, against 133 percent projected for Greece this year.
 But analysts said it still needed to pursue fiscal
consolidation and questioned how such significant tax cuts plans
would square with fiscal targets agreed under a European
Union/International Monetary Fund bailout underpinning the
export-heavy economy of 10 million people.
 Officials said at the weekend they would stick to the
deficit target agreed with the EU and IMF of 3.8 percent of
gross domestic product, and Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy
said spending cuts of 1.0-1.5 percent of GDP were needed.
 Some market watchers welcomed the flat income tax, noting
similar schemes in Slovakia and Romania led to higher budget
revenues because the lower rate cut down on tax evasion.
 But they added that Orban had given few details on his plans
and it was not clear whether the tax moves had been adequately
offset by spending cuts, which had been the main pillar of the
previous caretaker government's strategy.
""They are trying to pursue elements of their pro-growth
strategy... There is real fiscal loosening going on in terms of
the tax cuts,"" said Nomura economist Peter Attard Montalto.
 Moody's investor service said on Monday that Fidesz's
willingness to consider unorthodox pro-growth measures were
credit negative.
 News portal Index, citing unnamed sources, said the cabinet
had bowed to EU and IMF pressure and would abandon channelling
private pension funds to the state budget to raise income -- a
proposal some analysts said was tantamount to nationalisation.
 Some analysts said reform plans were still lacking.
 ""We still hope (maybe naively) that the government will use
its significant majority in Parliament to put through reforms in
the welfare, education, health and local government sectors to
continue with fiscal consolidation,"" Gyorgy Barta at CIB said.
 
 MARKETS RALLY
 The forint pared short-lived gains in volatile trade.It was
0.8 percent up on the day at 282.8 to the euro, slightly down
from levels before Orban's speech. The 5-year bond yield dropped
around 15 basis points.
 But after some early positive assessments of the proposed
steps, analysts said the tax on banks and ban on foreign
currency lending would hit banking profits and could smother
growth, seen up 0.5 percent after a 6.3 percent fall in 2009.
 The head of Hungary's banking association, Tamas Erdei, said
a foreign currency mortgage ban would be acceptable, but the
planned tax would be ""drastic"" and extremely harmful, damaging
banks' capital position and reducing lending. 
 The country's largest bank OTP held onto gains, trading up
1.6 percent at 1400 GMT but still 12 percent down from last
week. Analysts said the news of the tax was expected and had not
changed the overall value assessment on the bank.
 Economists said a bank tax would restrict a crucial driver
of Hungary's feeble recovery and the entire plan left questions
on budget sustainability unanswered.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Tuesday,
pausing from its recent sell-off and tracking slight gains in
global stocks, but its advance was limited by concerns about the
impact of euro zone debt problems on the world economy.
 An early rise in European shares helped to quell some risk
aversion, keeping higher-risk currencies near the day's highs
versus the safe-haven dollar and the yen.
 With little in the way of economic data or events to drive
the market, investors bought back the euro after it hit a
four-year low versus the dollar on Monday.
 ""Some people are trying to bottom fish at these levels,""
said John Hydeskov, senior currency analyst at Danske in
Copenhagen, adding that some European banks and corporates had
been picking up the single currency.
 He added that short covering may push the euro up to $1.2010
in the near term. A break through that level may briefly push
the euro up to $1.22 in the near term, he said.
 Euro zone ministers on Monday finalised arrangements for a
Special Purpose Vehicle to raise up to 440 billion euros to lend
to countries facing debt servicing problems. [ID:nLDE65612T]
 Some analysts said the widely expected move was also helping
to stop the euro's sell-off for the moment, while others in the
market said the euro may be hemmed by options barriers due to
expire later in the day.
 By 0743 GMT, the euro  traded 0.4 percent higher on
the day at $1.1960, having edged up to a session high of $1.1982
in earlier trade. Against the yen  the euro rose 0.9
percent to 109.80 yen.
 On Monday, the single currency fell as low as $1.1876 on
electronic trading platform EBS, its weakest since March 2006,
while plumbing 108.06 yen, its lowest in more than eight years.
 Slight gains in Asian shares helped to support the euro,
while European shares <.FTEU3> bobbed in and out of positive
territory in early trade.
The euro's stabilisation following hefty losses late last
week, when a weaker-than-expected reading of U.S. jobs data and
a warning by Hungary that it may face Greece-style debt problems
had triggered risk aversion.
 Market participants said a slew of options in the $1.19-1.20
region which were due to expire late in the day may confine the
single currency to narrow ranges in European trade.
 
 MORE EURO LOSSES?
 Currencies considered to be higher-risk gained on Tuesday,
pushing the Australian dollar  up 1 percent versus the
U.S. dollar, while the New Zealand currency rose 0.4 percent.
 This helped to push the dollar <.DXY> down a touch versus a
currency basket, while the yen stumbled across the board.
 Along with the SPV agreement, some in the market were also
heartened by the German government's agreement of an austerity
package while Hungary promised cuts to meet budget targets.
 Still, financial markets continued to fret over the region's
banking systems, and many investors expect the euro to suffer
more losses in the mid- to longer term.
 Market participants are expected to focus on developments in
European peripherals with particular focus on Hungary, to better
determine whether debt problems facing some euro zone countries
will spread beyond the 16-nation bloc.
 ""The macro picture remains indicative for the euro to remain
in a downtrend, especially versus the dollar,"" UBS analysts said
in a note.
 ""The outlook for weakening global growth momentum coupled
with structural problems in Europe remaining in tact does not
bode well for risk.""

 * Wall Street set for gains at the start
 * Euro steady to higher.
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 8 (Reuters) - Renewed worries about European
sovereign debt, this time Britain's, knocked equities back on
Tuesday and ate into early euro gains against the dollar.
 Wall Street looked set for some gains at the start, but
Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.9 percent, giving
up an early rise.
 That pushed MSCI's all-country world stock index
<.MIWD00000PUS> into negative territory, down 0.2 percent. The
emerging market sector <.MSCHIEF) was flat.
 Ratings agency Fitch unsettled investors in British assets,
saying ""the scale of the UK's fiscal challenge is formidable and
warrants a strong medium-term consolidation strategy --
including a faster pace of deficit reduction than set out in the
April 2010 budget.""
 It was the latest salvo in a series of concerns expressed by
rating agencies about the state of government finances in
Europe, including Greece, Spain, Hungary, Ireland and Britain.
 Solving the debt problem implies heavy budget cuts at a time
when many believe spending is needed to help keep economic
recovery on track.
 ""There's a growing, pervasive sense of unease,"" said Mike
Lenhoff, chief strategist and head of research at Brewin Dolphin
Securities in London. ""Maybe the way the markets are beginning
to look at this now is that the fiscal austerity is going to be
a major restraining feature.""
 Investors are currently balancing negative sentiment
engendered by the likes of the Greek debt crisis with positive
sentiment from relatively good economic outlooks in countries
like Germany and the United States.
 ""There are concerns that the global economy might lose its
footing going forward, but recent data, including upbeat
corporate earnings, runs counter to that,"" said Mitsuo Shimizu,
deputy general manager at Cosmo Securities in Japan.
 
 STEADIER EURO
 The euro came off its highs but was still up 0.1 percent at
$1.1931 , hovering near a four-year low hit against the
dollar on Monday.
 It was up 0.4 percent against sterling at 0.8266 pence as
the British currency was hit by Fitch's comments .
 ""There's been a big drop in equity markets and something of
a rise in general volatility,"" said Peter Frank, currency
strategist at Societe Generale.
 Analysts said the euro gained support earlier in the day
after euro zone ministers made final arrangements on Monday to
set up funds for countries facing debt servicing problems.

 (Adds details, background)
 BUDAPEST, June 8 (Reuters) - Hungary's government has likely
abandoned the idea of channelling private pension funds into the
state budget as a form of raising extra revenues due to
opposition from the IMF and EU, news portal Index said on
Tuesday.
 Citing several unnamed sources, Index said the government
is, however, likely to go ahead with a plan of imposing some
kind of special tax on banks' profits.
 Daily newspaper Nepszabadsag also said the government was
unlikely to try to channel private pension funds into the budget
and thereby reduce the budget deficit as it strives to limit
this year's fiscal gap to 3.8 percent of GDP.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban is expected to outline plans to
the ruling Fidesz party's lawmakers at a meeting later in the
day and after that he is expected to announce the plans to
parliament at 1100 GMT.
 Hungary's centre-right government promised to cut spending
on Monday as it sought to repair damage from comments last week
about a possible Greece-style debt crisis, as analysts said it
will take months to rebuild policy credibility. [ID:nLDE6560XG]
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Monday the new
government, in office since May 29, would stick to a budget
deficit target of 3.8 percent this year and would need to cut
spending by 1.0-1.5 percent of gross domestic product.
 Index said on Tuesday that the government had most probably
dropped the idea of a shift in the pension system as the
country's lenders the International Monetary Fund and the EU did
not approve the proposal.
 The first tier of Hungary's pension system is a publicly
managed, pay-as-you-go financed social security pension scheme,
which covers all employees and the self-employed.
Under a reform of the pension system in 1997 Hungary
introduced a second funded tier, causing a deficit in the first
tier when a proportion of the contributions were redirected
to mandatory private pension funds.
 By bringing these funds under the umbrella of the state
budget the government could have reduced the deficit sharply, by
hundreds of billions of forints per year but several analysts
said such a move would likely not have been received well by
markets.
 Index also said that this year's tax cuts would be mostly
symbolic.
 However, a new tax on banks' and other financial firms'
profits could bring over 100 billion forints ($417 million) into
state coffers, the website said.
 The bank tax talk sent the shares of Hungary's leading
lender OTP Bank  into a tailspin on Monday but the
stock clawed back ground later in the day.
 Morgan Stanley upgraded OTP Bank to 'Equal' from
'Underweight' as the share price fell below its mark-to-market
implied price target of 5,000 forints, the investment bank said
in a note on Tuesday.
 The forint  traded at 285.80 versus the euro at
0631 GMT, up from an opening level of 287.55 in thin trade.

 * Fed Bernanke says Europe committed to euro's survival
 * Aussie 1-mth risk reversals show growing bias for puts
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro edged up but was still
near four-year lows against the dollar on Tuesday as a short
squeeze showed signs of waning and funds were expected to resume
selling on persistent worries about Europe's financial system.
 Higher-yielders such as the Australian and New Zealand
dollars bounced 1 percent up against the yen as investors covered
some of their extreme short positions after Asian stock markets
gained, despite Wall Street's tumble on Monday.
 The euro also rose against the yen after hitting its lowest
in more than 8 years at 108.06 yen on Monday, and one trader said
it had technical scope to rebound towards 111 yen.
 But the market remains bearish on the euro generally, with
Monday's four-year low of $1.1876 still a downside target,
followed by expected options triggers around $1.1850.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said European
leaders were committed to ensuring the survival of the euro and
had enough money to meet obligations of heavily indebted member
countries.
 But traders remained sceptical.
 ""Although nothing has changed, moderate gains in regional
stocks helped investors, probably led by speculators, to cover
short-positions in yen crosses but such gains are likely to be
limited,"" said Kazuyuki Kato, treasury department manager at
Mizuho Trust & Banking.
 ""The market remains sensitive to negative news on Europe and
it will be difficult for the euro to move higher around the $1.20
level.""
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1960, with support expected
at Monday's $1.1876 low. The currency fell 0.3 percent on Monday,
after losing more than 2.7 percent last week.
 Traders say the next option trigger for the euro comes at
$1.1850, with another likely target at about $1.1825, its March
2006 low. Below that, traders saw little support until its
November 2005 low around $1.1640, although its 1999 launch level
of $1.1747 was also a potential key marker.
 It rose 0.7 percent to 109.70 yen after falling 0.9 percent
on Monday. Immediate support is seen at about 107.95 yen, the
76.4 percent retracement of its move up from a low in October
2000 to a high of 170 yen in July 2008.
 Finance ministers from the debt-stricken euro zone agreed to
set up a safety net arrangement on Monday.
 Germany's government agreed a package of austerity measures
and Hungary promised cuts to meet budget targets, but financial
markets continued to fret over the region's banking systems.
 Spreads over German Bunds widened, reflecting those
concerns. The 10-year Italian/German spread came close to 180
basis points -- a euro lifetime high -- while Spanish/German
spreads moved above 200 basis points for the first time. 
 ""The near-term market driver should be developments in
European peripherals with particular focus on Hungary,"" JP Morgan
said in a morning note.
 ""As there are many auctions in the euro area countries this
week, results from these auctions would affect government bond
yield spreads between European peripherals and Germany and their
impact on risk assets and forex.""
 Euro zone governments will issue about 27.5 billion euros
worth of new bonds this week, with Spain, Portugal and Italy all
due to hold auctions. Spain faces redemptions and coupon payments
worth more than 20 billion euros in July, raising worries it may
face a difficult month of refunding.
 Meanwhile, the dollar index slipped to 88.265 after hitting a
15-month high of 88.708. The focus is on 89.624, the high hit in
early March 2009 when the global financial crisis was still
playing out.
 The dollar climbed 0.4 percent to 91.76 yen, having
lost some ground on Monday as yen gains against riskier
currencies weighed on the pair.
 The Australian dollar jumped more than 1 percent to $0.8204,
with talk of hedge fund buying. Against the yen, it rose 1.6
percent to 75.24 yen.
 But the outlook for the Aussie remains difficult. Aussie
one-month 25 delta risk reversals -- seen by many as a barometer
for short term fear -- were once again showing an extreme bias
for puts, sitting at 4.4/5.4 percent, up from around 3.50 percent
on June 3.
 The New Zealand dollar climbed 0.7 percent to $0.6628, having
slid more than 1.7 percent on Monday. It rose 1 percent to 60.83
yen.

(Adds comment from coalition partner Kamei)
 By Linda Sieg and Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, June 8 (Reuters) - New Japanese leader Naoto Kan
vowed to tackle Japan's huge public debt and keep ties with ally
Washington on track as he launched a cabinet that also aims to
sideline a scandal-tainted party power broker before an
election.
 The choice of Kan, 63, as Japan's fifth premier in three
years, has bolstered his Democratic Party's chances in an upper
house election it needs to win to break free of a tiny partner
and avoid having to find more allies to pass bills easily.
 The Democrats will stay in power regardless of the outcome
of the upper house poll, expected in July, but a revamped
coalition could complicate policymaking, depending on its
composition.
 Coming off a six-month stint as finance minister, Kan
appears committed to reining in a public debt that is already
twice the size of the economy. His cabinet also seems united on
the topic, except for banking minister Shizuka Kamei, who heads
a tiny coalition party and likes big spending.
 ""Restoring our fiscal health is indispensable for economic
growth,"" Kan told a news conference, adding that just raising
taxes would spur deflation and that it was necessary to
prioritise spending on growth areas. He also urged a
non-partisan debate on fiscal and tax reform.
 Kan, who takes over after indecisive predecessor Yukio
Hatoyama squandered sky-high support during just eight months in
office, gave the finance portfolio to fellow fiscal conservative
Yoshihiko Noda.
 He also appointed like-minded former national strategy
minister Yoshito Sengoku as chief cabinet secretary -- the top
government spokesman and an important policy coordinator.
 ""Kan has called for the need for fiscal reform, so that's
the direction the new government will head in. But the question
is how much they can actually deliver,"" said Takeshi Minami,
chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
 The next general election must be held by late 2013, and
while the Democrats have pledged not to raise the 5 percent
sales tax before then, party fiscal reformers want to state
clearly their intention to do so before that vote takes place.
 WEAK YEN, OZAWA FACTOR
 Kan's commitment to fiscal reform, though, could well be
tested by an economic slowdown.
 ""As long as the economy sustains its recovery, Kan will
start working on fixing Japan's finances,"" Minami said. ""If
problems in Europe begin to hurt and undermine the recovery,
there's a risk Japan will turn back to big spending again.
 Kamei could also prove a headache, since the Democrats need
his tiny party's support to pass bills in the upper house.
 ""Unless the economy grows, it is impossible to secure
revenue merely by (reforming) the tax system,"" he told a news
conference.
 In a sign the recovery remains fragile, bank lending marked
its biggest annual fall in nearly five years in May, as
companies remained reluctant to boost capital spending.
 Relatively low government bond yields suggest the market is
not expecting an immediate crisis, but credit ratings agencies
have threatened downgrades if the government fails to craft
credible plans to rein in debt and spur growth.
 Kan also said he was aware of the view that a weak yen was
good for Japan's export-driven economy, but perhaps having
learned caution as finance minister, steered clear of more
specific comments.
 Kan reappointed 11 ministers from Hatoyama's cabinet,
including Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada, who must help manage
ties with ally Washington, since an agreement to keep a U.S.
airbase on Okinawa island -- forged amid controversy in
Hatoyama's final days -- faces stiff opposition from residents.
 Kan told the news conference that U.S-Japan ties would
remain the core of Japan's diplomacy and that he would honour
the bilateral deal while trying hard to reduce the burden on
Okinawa, reluctant host to about half the U.S. forces in the
country.
 Many in the cabinet roster are also critics of party power
broker Ichiro Ozawa, whose campaign skills were widely seen as
helping the Democrats win last year's election but whose image
as an old-style wheeler dealer has become a liability.
 Ozawa has come under fire in a political funding scandal and
could face charges in the case.
 Kan, a former grass-roots activist with a reputation for
challenging the status quo, must convince voters that Ozawa has
been sidelined without triggering internal party warfare with
the veteran politician and his numerous backers.
 Ozawa was conspicuous by his absence.
 But few pundits expect him to fade entirely away, and the
veteran politician has already hinted that he may seek to oust
Kan if the Democrats fare badly in the upper house election.
 The degree of Ozawa's clout matters both to voters worried
that he is trying to revive the vested-interest politics
perfected by the LDP during its half-century rule, and to
financial markets nervous about Japan's debt.
 Ozawa has opposed making a clear statement in the party's
election platform on the need to raise the sales tax.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro bounced from a
four-year low and Asian stocks edged up on Tuesday as traders
paused a selloff of riskier assets ahead of Chinese economic
data and a European Central Bank meeting later in the week.
 Major European stock futures were up as much as 0.4 percent
and U.S. stock futures rose 1 percent with equity markets
consolidating globally after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke offered supportive comments for the euro and said the
U.S. economy had enough momentum to avoid a ""double-dip""
recession.
 Fears about a spreading European sovereign debt crisis, a
slowdown in China's robust growth and a weak U.S. job market
have combined to sap investors' willingness to take risks for
higher returns, prompting them to dump equities, high-yield
bonds, the euro and emerging market currencies.
 The euro has fallen 12 percent so far in the second quarter
-- on track for the biggest quarterly decline since being
launched in 1999 -- and global equities are the cheapest since
the latest bull market started in March 2009.
 The pace of decline has enticed some buyers to sift through
the market, with an eye for value.
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 0.2 percent while the
MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index added 0.7 percent. The
ex-Japan index has lost some 12 percent so far this year.
 ""We're seeing cherry-picking of shares today. Caution
pervades after the U.S. market's substantial losses and
continued foreign selling, but investors are scooping up some
shares that they're bullish on in the longer-term,"" said Kim
Jeong-hoon, a market analyst at Korea Investment & Securities
in Seoul.
 The euro climbed 0.5 percent to $1.1975 as some dealers
covered their bets against the currency, lifting it up from a
four-year low of $1.1875 plumbed overnight.
 Bernanke said European leaders were committed to ensuring
the survival of the euro and have the means to support every
heavily indebted member of the currency union.
 After a policy meeting on Thursday, ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet will likely face tough questioning at a
news conference about liquidity provisions in the euro zone,
the stability of the European financial system and details
about the central bank's surprise government bond buying
programme.
 The Australian dollar, a favourite of investors because of
its relatively high interest rate, rose 1.3 percent to
US$0.8203 retracing almost all of Monday's losses.
 FINDING BARGAINS
 The Nikkei also benefited from short covering as a key
support level held in the face of early selling. The benchmark
suffered its biggest one-day fall in 14 months on Monday.
 ""Though pension funds are likely to emerge to buy at the
lows, even retail investors are starting to get a bit spooked
at this point, so whether they'll buy or not is key,"" said
Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities in
Tokyo.
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.2 percent, with gains
in index-heavyweight HSBC winning out over small losses in
other banks and land developers.
 Short-selling of Hong Kong-listed equities dropped to 8.4
percent from 10.4 percent of trading volume on Monday, a dealer
said. Banks are the most shorted sector, followed by real
estate.
 Valuations of global equities have come down quickly in the
last several weeks, but analysts appear divided over whether
the market is bottoming out. The MSCI index of world equities
is trading at 11.4 times its expected 12-month earnings, the
lowest since March 2009.
 The uncertain global economic outlook could have an impact
on earnings forecasts, though economists as a whole have not
changed their growth predictions in a big way.
 Asian investors are awaiting a flurry of data from China
this week after reports last month indicated growth may have
peaked in the world's third-largest economy.
 Though the number of property sales in big Chinese cities
is decreasing, likely pointing to an easing in price pressures,
other indicators do not reflect a massive slowdown in the
world's fastest growing economy or its demand for imported
goods. PRE-
 On the contrary, Taiwan's exports to China in May rose 66
percent on year-on-year basis, indicating sustained demand from
a key trade market.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rebounded to 3.20
percent after finishing trade in New York around 3.15 percent.
 Still, in the last two months the yield has tumbled 65
basis points, squashed by investors exiting risky trades and
buying Treasuries, particularly late-dated maturities. The
spread between 10-year and 2-year yields has narrowed 37 basis
points since April.
 The sliding U.S. dollar put some upward pressure on crude
prices. The July contract was up 0.7 percent at $71.90 a
barrel.

the market, with an eye for value.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> share average rose 0.2 percent while
the MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> added 0.7

 ""We're seeing cherry-picking of shares today. Caution

 The euro climbed 0.5 percent to $1.1975  as some

 The Nikkei also benefited from short covering as a key
support level held in the face of early selling. The benchmark
suffered its biggest one-day fall in 14 months on Monday.
 ""Though pension funds are likely to emerge to buy at the
lows, even retail investors are starting to get a bit spooked
at this point, so whether they'll buy or not is key,"" said
Kenichi Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities in
Tokyo.
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index <.HSI> was up 0.2 percent, with
gains in index-heavyweight HSBC <0005.HK> winning out over
small losses in other banks and land developers.
 Short-selling of Hong Kong-listed equities dropped to 8.4
percent from 10.4 percent of trading volume on Monday, a dealer
said. Banks are the most shorted sector, followed by real
estate.
 Valuations of global equities have come down quickly in the
last several weeks, but analysts appear divided over whether
the market is bottoming out. The MSCI index of world equities
is trading at 11.4 times its expected 12-month earnings, the
lowest since March 2009.
 The uncertain global economic outlook could have an impact
on earnings forecasts, though economists as a whole have not
changed their growth predictions in a big way.
 Asian investors are awaiting a flurry of data from China
this week after reports last month indicated growth may have
peaked in the world's third-largest economy.
 Though the number of property sales in big Chinese cities
is decreasing, likely pointing to an easing in price pressures,
other indicators do not reflect a massive slowdown in the
world's fastest growing economy or its demand for imported
goods. [CN-PRE-MCE]
 On the contrary, Taiwan's exports to China in May rose 66
percent on year-on-year basis, indicating sustained demand from
a key trade market.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield 
rebounded to 3.20 percent after finishing trade in New York
around 3.15 percent.
 Still, in the last two months the yield has tumbled 65
basis points, squashed by investors exiting risky trades and
buying Treasuries, particularly late-dated maturities. The
spread between 10-year and 2-year yields has narrowed 37 basis
points since April.
 The sliding U.S. dollar put some upward pressure on crude
prices. The July contract  was up 0.7 percent at $71.90 a
barrel.

 SHANGHAI, June 8 (Reuters) - Portugal's economy minister said
on Tuesday it was hard to say if the euro had hit bottom, adding
that he hoped the steps taken so far to stabilise the debt crisis

fallen enough.
 ""I don't think we are going to have an evolution toward a

having fallen sharply over the last several weeks on debt
problems in Greece, Portugal and other countries.

to reform its exchange rate regime, a Chinese government
economist said in comments published on Tuesday.
 Fan Jianjun, a financial researcher with the Development
Research Centre, a think-tank under the State Council, or
cabinet, told the China Economic Times that the central bank
should halt its currency intervention and let market forces
decide the yuan's rate.
 Fan represents a minority view.
 Few other advocates of greater yuan flexibility in government
and research circles argue that the People's Bank of China should
simply stand aside and allow supply and demand to drive the yuan.
 The goal of China's currency reform should be to develop a
market-based exchange rate so that the PBOC, once freed of the
responsibility of controlling the exchange rate, can concentrate
on monetary policy and economic stability, Fan said.
 At present, the central bank permits the yuan to move up or
down 0.5 percent a day against the dollar from a central parity
it sets every morning. Through its interventions to prevent the
yuan from rising, the PBOC has accumulated $2.45 trillion in
currency reserves, the world's largest stockpile.
 Fan said pressure on the yuan  to appreciate
against the dollar has weakened significantly over the past
weeks; the Chinese currency's rate was now close to a ""balanced""
level.
 ""Pushing forward exchange rate reform now will not lead to a
sharp appreciation in the yuan, and it will not have a
significant impact on the real economy,"" Fan said in
question-and-answer interview in the newspaper, which is

216,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2010 09:39PM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-Japan PM Kan to launch new govt as election looms," By Linda Sieg
 TOKYO, June 8 (Reuters) - New Japanese leader Naoto Kan will
launch his cabinet on Tuesday as expectations jostle with doubts
that he can clip the wings of a scandal-tainted party powerbroker
and begin to tackle the nation's huge public debt.
 Kan, 63, to be sworn in as Japan's fifth premier in three
years, must convince voters to give his Democratic Party a second
chance in a looming election after predecessor Yukio Hatoyama
squandered sky-high support during his eight months in office.
 The Democrats will stay in power regardless of the outcome of
the upper house election expected next month. But without a
majority on their own, they will remain dependent on a tiny
coalition partner and may need to find more allies to pass
legislation smoothly, complicating the outlook for policymaking.
 Kan, who forged an image as a fiscal conservative after
taking over as finance minister in January, is expected to hand
fellow fiscal reformer Yoshihiko Noda the finance portfolio.
 He will also appoint like-minded former National Strategy
Minister Yoshito Sengoku as chief cabinet secretary -- the top
government spokesman and an important policy coordinator.
 Kan faces the urgent task of keeping an economic recovery on
track while trying to rein in dependence on the borrowing that
has inflated Japan's debt to twice the size of its GDP.
 In a sign the recovery remains fragile, bank lending marked
its biggest annual fall in nearly five years in May, as companies
remained reluctant to boost capital spending.
 Kan will likely also reappoint many ministers from Hatoyama's
cabinet, including Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada, who must help
manage ties with ally Washington, since an agreement to keep a
U.S. airbase on Okinawa island -- forged amid controversy in
Hatoyama's final days -- faces stiff opposition from residents.
 Many in the expected cabinet roster are critics of party
powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, whose campaign skills were widely seen
as helping the Democrats win last year's election but whose image
as an old-style wheeler dealer has become a liability.
 OZAWA FACTOR, KAMEI HEADACHE
 Ozawa has come under fire in a political funding scandal and
could face charges in the case.
 Kan, a former grassroots activist with a reputation for
challenging the status quo, must tread a fine line between
convincing voters that Ozawa has been sidelined without
triggering internal party warfare with the veteran politician and
his numerous backers.
 ""I want us all to vow to fight and to work as one ... to win
the upcoming election, which we cannot afford to lose to make the
change in government real, to make this a stable government,"" Kan
told a party gathering Monday after announcing his new party
executives.
 Ozawa was conspicuous by his absence.
 But few pundits expect Ozawa to fade entirely away, and the
veteran politician has already hinted that he may seek to oust
Kan if the Democrats fare badly in the upper house election.
 The degree of Ozawa's clout matters both to voters worried
that he is trying to revive the vested-interest politics
perfected by the LDP during its half-century rule, and to
financial markets nervous about Japan's debt.
 Ozawa has opposed making a clear statement in the party's
election platform on the need to raise the 5 percent sales tax to
help repair Japan's tattered finances.
 Kan will also have his hands full coping with his coalition
ally Shizuka Kamei, who heads a small conservative party whose
votes are needed in the upper house to pass laws smoothly.
 Kamei, expected to be kept as banking minister, has advocated
big spending to boost growth and insists that a controversial
bill to roll back privatisation of the postal system be enacted
in a session of parliament scheduled to end on June 16.

 * Spreads over German Bunds rise, reflecting growing stress
 * Aussie 1-mth risk reversals show growing bias for puts
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 8 (Reuters) - The euro was pinned near four
years lows on Tuesday, as a short squeeze seen in the previous
session was showing signs of waning with funds expected to resume
selling on lingering stress about the European financial system.
 Finance Ministers from the debt-striken euro zone agreed to
set up a safety net arrangement on Monday. [ID:nLDE65612T].
Germany's coalition government agreed for austerity measures and
Hungary promised cuts to meet budget targets, but financial
markets continued to fret over the region's banking systems.
 Infact, spreads over German Bunds widened, reflecting those
concerns. The 10-year Italian/German spread  came
close to 180 basis points -- a euro lifetime high, while
Spanish/German spreads  moved above 200 basis for
the first time.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was steady at $1.1922, off a
four year low of $1.1876, which some see as the currency's near
term support as it coincides with the 200-month moving average.
The euro lost over 0.4 percent on Monday, after having lost over
2.5 percent last week.
 Traders say the next option trigger for the euro comes at
$1.1850 and a likely target at $1.1825, the euro's March 2006
low. Below that, traders saw little support until its November
2005 low of $1.1638, though the euro's 1999 launch level of
$1.1747 was also a potential key marker.
 ""The near-term market driver should be developments in
European peripherals with particular focus on Hungary,"" JP Morgan
said in a morning note.
 ""As there are many auctions in the euro area countries this
week, results from these auctions would affect government bond
yield spreads between European peripherals and Germany and their
impact on risk assets and forex.""
 Euro zone governments will issue about 27.5 billion euros
worth of new bonds this week, with Spain, Portugal and Italy all
due to hold auctions. [GVD/EUR]. In addition, Spain faces
redemptions and coupon payments worth more than 20 billion euros
in July, raising worries it may face a difficult month of
refunding.
 Meanwhile, the dollar index <.DXY> continued to trade firm,
hitting 88.708, and keeping the focus on 89.624, the high hit
early March 2009 when the global financial crisis was still
playing out.
 The dollar was steady on the yen  at 91.63 yen, having
lost some ground on Monday with risk aversion dominant as stock
markets <.SPX> took another tumble. The yen usually tends to gain
the most when risk aversion is on the rise and volatility spikes.
 The euro/yen  was marginally lower at 109.21 yen
with immediate support seen around 107.95 yen, which is the 76.4
percent retracement of the euro's move up from a low in Oct 2000
to a high of 170 yen in July 2008 on the Fibonacci charts.
 Investors remained wary of growth-linked currencies and
unwound leveraged carry trades as stock markets <.SPX> continued
to fall. The Australian dollar , which fell 1.5 percent
on Monday, stabilised at $0.8123 but the outlook remained grim.
 In fact, Aussie one-month 25 delta risk reversals
 -- seen by many as a barometer for short term
fear-- was once again showing a extreme bias for puts, sitting at
4.4/5.4 percent, up from around 3.50 percent on June 3.
 The New Zealand dollar likewise was subdued at $0.6590
, having slid more than 1.7 percent on Monday.

 * Strong German manufacturing data fails to rally markets
 * Gold rallies to just below all-time highs
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on low volume
on Monday after strong German manufacturing data failed to
improve restore investor confidence in global economic recovery
in the wake of poor U.S. jobs data on Friday.
 The euro slid to a new four year low below $1.19, while
safe-haven investments such as U.S. Treasuries gained, and gold
prices rose to just $10 below their all-time high as on concern
that the U.S. economic recovery may be slowing, Europe's
economies are being hit by fiscal austerity measures and even
China's boom may be topping out.
 Data Friday showed the U.S. economy generated fewer jobs
than expected in May and comments from Hungarian officials
suggested the country could face a Greek-style debt crisis. The
Hungarian government on Monday though stressed that the country
was not in the same situation as Greece and would meet budget
deficit targets set in an aid deal with the International
Monetary Fund and European Union.
 Germany Monday reported industrial orders jumped far
more than expected in April, adding to signs that Europe's
largest economy was on the path to durable growth, but the data
did little to raise hopes of a healthy recovery in Europe as a
whole.
 ""There is a lot of nervousness in the market. On the one
hand we have the positive (German manufacturing) data, but
there is also anxiety about Hungary keeping pressure on the
market,"" said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity markets
strategist at Deutsche Postbank.
 U.S. stocks dropped on low volume, led by industrial and
technology shares, as investors stayed on the sidelines after
last week's jobs data discouraged buyers.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> ended down 115.48
points, or 1.16 percent, at 9,816.49. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> fell 14.41 points, or 1.35 percent, at 1,050.47.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 45.27 points, or
2.04 percent, at 2,173.90.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index fell almost 2.0
percent, and its emerging market index dropped 2.7 percent.
 In the currency markets, European corporate demand helped
lift the euro after it fell to $1.1876, its weakest level since
March 2006. But the euro remained below $1.20, a level broken
on Friday after Hungary's warning about its deficit reminded
investors of the severe debt problems plaguing some European
countries.
 The euro last traded down 0.48 percent at $1.1916 from a
previous session close of $1.1973. Against the Japanese yen,
the U.S. dollar  was down 0.46 percent at 91.49 from a
previous session close of 91.910.
 ""After Hungary's warning and weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs
data Friday, selling got a bit overdone,"" said Amelia Bourdeau,
senior strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Hungary -- a member of the European Union but not the euro
zone -- is of minimal importance on the global level, but there
are concerns about exposure among leading banks if Hungary
defaults or if the fall in the forint currency fuels a rise in
loan delinquency among Hungarians who have borrowed heavily in
euros and Swiss francs.
 It also comes hard on the heels of worries about defaults
in Greece and other southern euro zone members.
 ""Greece can't devalue or easily default on its debt, but
presumably Hungary can, so it's a double-edged blade,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
Euro zone governments will issue about 27.5 billion euros
worth of new bonds this week, with Spain, Portugal and Italy
all due to hold auctions.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index closed 1.0
percent lower, pressured by a fall in BP's stock . The
U.S. Coast Guard said the United States will be dealing with
the oil spill from the April 20 rig explosion for another four
to six weeks. BP plans to double the amount of oil it is
capturing from its ruptured Gulf of Mexico well to 20,000
barrels per day.
 Adding to the pressure, Goldman Sachs downgraded the oil
major to ""neutral"" from ""buy.""
 U.S. Treasuries climbed as increasingly risk-averse
investors continued to look for safe-haven government bonds and
ahead of this week's $70 billion supply.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
1/32, with the yield at 3.2022 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.746
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down
2/32, with the yield at 4.1361 percent.
Spot gold prices  rallied $21.40, or 1.76 percent, to
$1240.40 an ounce just $10 below its all-time high as investors
took advantage of the dip in prices to buy the metal as a haven
from risk in other markets.
 ""We are seeing gold as the ultimate currency because of all
of these growing uncertainties surrounding sovereign debt in
the euro zone, and the fact that there are very few attractive
currencies out there, said Bill O'Neill, partner at New
Jersey-based commodity firm LOGIC Advisors.

 MONTREAL, June 7 (Reuters) - Countries with big deficits
must offer clear plans on how they will balance their budgets
to maintain investor confidence and avoid problems seen in
Europe, top economic policymakers said on Monday.
 The warnings came after finance ministers and central
bankers meeting in South Korea reached an uneasy compromise on
Saturday on the speed at which budget cuts should be made to
calm global financial markets rattled by the spreading debt
crisis in Europe. [ID:nTOE65400M] [ID:nSGE64R00R]
 ""Make sure that you give signals to the markets about
fiscal consolidation,"" Angel Gurria, head of the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), told a
conference in Montreal on Monday.
 Gurria said it was imperative that countries announce their
fiscal plans to avoid what happened with Greece's debt crisis,
when uncertainty spurred investors to sell the country's bonds
and drive its borrowing costs higher.
 ""Do we have to start now? No. Do we have to announce now?
Yes,"" said Gurria, secretary-general of the OECD, a group of 31
countries that promotes democratic government and market-based
economies.
 Financial markets fear that other countries could suffer
the same fate as Greece, which has already taken drastic
measures to bring its fiscal house in order.
 Greece has pledged to cut its public deficit by almost a
third to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product this year.
Germany has also announced plans to pursue savings in an effort
to shore up confidence in the finances of the 16 nations that
use the euro.
 Policymakers from Canada, whose banks weathered the 2008
financial crisis without any government support, expressed
concern about the continuing economic uncertainty in Europe.
 ""We've pushed hard for those countries that need to
fiscally consolidate in Europe to get on with it and to

Flaherty told reporters in Toronto.
 ""This is important because there is a risk to economic
growth generally if the fiscal consolidation issue is not dealt

 Hungary rattled investors last week with comments

 European Central Bank board member Christian Noyer said
that the recent developments in Greece show the recovery is

European Union is favorable. [ID:nN07190822]
 The Greek debt crisis illustrates the risks of postponing
deficit control measures, Noyer told the Montreal conference.
 Euro zone finance ministers are trying to set up a vehicle
for emergency borrowing that would act as a safety net for
countries that are not able to obtain financing from markets.
[ID:nLDE6561NW]
 Although economic recovery has been fragile in Europe,
structural reforms could allow it to ""leave behind the crisis
once and for all,"" said Noyer, who is also governor of the Bank
of France.
 At the conference in Montreal, Bank of Canada Governor
Mark Carney said he has confidence in the ECB's actions to
contain the European crisis.
 Carney said ""regulatory certainty"" is needed to get the
global financial sector back on track.
 The United States and the European Union are trying to
overhaul their financial regulation systems to safeguard
against future financial crises.
 The United States and other countries had proposed imposing
a tax on financial services firms in an effort to make the
firms pay for their own bailouts. But finance ministers from
the world's top economies on the weekend scrapped plans for
such a tax.
 Noyer said that it was more important for banks to have
sufficient capital than to impose a tax on financial
institutions. The danger would be to weaken the strength of
banks' balance sheets, Noyer said.
 Noyer noted that his comments on Monday should not be taken
as indication of policy decisions that will be taken at the

221,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2010 04:19PM ET</span>",Euro zone ups SPV loan guarantees to get top rating," * Countries to guarantee 120 percent of their share of loans
 * Intention is to secure highest rating for the debt
 * Aim is also to ensure creditors can be paid off
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 LUXEMBOURG, June 7 (Reuters) - Countries setting up an
emergency loan company for the euro zone will each guarantee 120
percent of their share of the loans to secure the highest rating
for the debt, euro zone officials said on Monday.
 By providing more than 100 percent of the loan guarantees,
euro zone countries hope to ensure that creditors can still be
paid off if one or more country runs into financial problems and
is unable to make good on its guarantees.
 The company is called the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) and is part of efforts to prevent other
countries that use the euro suffering similar problems to
heavily indebted Greece. 
 European Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said after
talks between euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg that the
ministers expected it to secure a AAA credit rating.
 ""Ministers have agreed on a number of measures to ensure the
best possible credit quality and rating for the debt instruments
issued by EFSF,"" the ministers said in a statement. 
 The statement said the measures included ""a 120 percent
guarantee of each Member State's pro rata share for each
individual bond issue and the constitution, when loans are made,
of a cash reserve to provide an additional cushion or cash
buffer for the operation of the EFSF."" 
 ""Member States have agreed that other mechanisms would be
adopted if needed to further enhance the creditworthiness of the
bonds or debt securities issued by the EFSF,"" it said.
 The company, a special purpose vehicle (SPV), will be a
limited liability company operating under Luxembourg law that
will be able to borrow up to 440 billion euros ($525.4 billion)
on the market by issuing bonds guaranteed by euro zone states.
 Altafaj said that since the bonds would be guaranteed by the
euro zone, it would be fair to call them eurobonds.
 ""The facility will be operational as soon as countries
representing 90 percent of shareholdings have completed their
national procedures, which is expected is the course of June,""
Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the group of euro zone
finance ministers, told a news conference.
 ""The recruiting process for the CEO of the facility has
begun and he or she will be nominated very shortly, in the
coming days, along with the chairman of the board,"" he said.
 European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn said the SPV would be run by a board of directors -- the
same people who represent euro zone countries in the economic
and financial committee that prepares ministers' meetings. 
 The European Commission, the EU executive, will contribute
to the management of the SPV and, together with the European
Central Bank, assess requests for aid from the facility and set
conditions for it.
 The European Investment Bank said it was ready to provide
treasury management services and administrative support to the
company through a service level contract. 
 ""The EIB's role would be similar to the back office support
it provides already to a number of trust and other funds set up
by the Commission and Member States,"" the bank said.

 * Decision reassures other candidates on euro adoption
 
 By Marcin Grajewski
 LUXEMBOURG, June 7 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
on Monday approved Estonia's bid to join the currency area next
year as its 17th member, reassuring other candidates that the
bloc would remain open despite its debt problems.
 Siding with a recommendation by the European Union's
executive arm, the ministers said the Baltic country of 1.4
million met all criteria to adopt the euro, and had committed to
tough fiscal policies together with structural reform.
""Estonia will become the 17th member of the euro area on the
1st of January, 2011,"" Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker
told a news conference.
 ""The first commitment of the Estonian authorities is to
ensure the sustainability of convergence and implement further
reforms containing financial discipline, preserving financial
stability,"" he added.
 Approval by EU leaders will be needed for the Estonian bid,
but this is not seen as a hurdle despite some doubts at the
European Central Bank over the country's ability to control
inflation.
 Estonia will become the fifth of the states that joined the
EU in 2004 to adopt the currency. Slovenia entered the euro zone
in 2007, Cyprus and Malta in 2008 and Slovakia in 2009.
 The decision will reassure other candidates that the euro
zone remains open for expansion despite Greece's debt crisis,
which has fuelled tension in the region and forced it to create
a $1 trillion aid mechanism for members with solvency problems.
 ""We have to treat everybody similarly. If there is a country
that fulfils all the criteria, it should have the same right as
we all have had,"" Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen told
reporters before the ministers' meeting.
 The next euro zone enlargement is not expected for another
four years as other candidates such as the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland have high budget deficits, inflation or both.
 Tensions in the currency area have also dampened enthusiasm
towards adopting the euro quickly among some politicians from
candidate countries.
 The move rewards Estonia's austerity programme, which was
implemented despite a deep recession last year and has ensured
the country's budget deficit is below 3 percent of gross
domestic product -- one criterion for joining the euro zone.
 The adoption of the euro is not expected to change much for
Estonia's investors and its citizens since the country has long
kept its kroon fixed against the euro in a currency board.
 The country cut its budget deficit to 1.7 percent of GDP
last year despite an economic contraction of nearly 15 percent.
Estonia also has one of the smallest national debts in the
27-country EU -- 7.2 percent of GDP.

 By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell below $1.19 on
Monday for the first time in more than four years, but
recovered some losses as strong German manufacturing data
prompted investors to book profits after the currency's recent
slide.
 European corporate demand helped the euro rebound after it
touched $1.1876  -- its weakest level since March
2006.
 But it remained well below $1.20, a key psychological level
pierced on Friday after Hungary's warning about its deficit
stoked investor worries of the severe debt problems plaguing
some European countries.
 ""After Hungary's warning and weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs
data on Friday, selling got a bit overdone,"" said Amelia
Bourdeau, senior strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""But what investors are doing is waiting for short squeezes
like this that push the euro up and then preparing to re-enter
short positions,"" she added. ""Things were overdone last week
but there isn't much on the horizon that's euro-positive.""
 Data on Friday showed speculators trimmed net short
positions on the euro slightly in the week ended June 1, but
were still heavily positioned against the currency, which has
lost nearly 17 percent against the dollar in 2010. [IMM/FX]
 The euro  last traded down 0.1 percent at $1.1961. On
Friday, it tumbled 1.5 percent after a weaker-than-expected
U.S. jobs report suggested the global recovery may be running
out of steam diminished investor taste for risk and enhanced
the dollar's safe-haven appeal. Stocks traded near flat after
tumbling on Friday.
 The euro was down little changed at 110.03 yen 
while the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 91.99 yen . The euro
hit a record low at earlier 1.3850 Swiss francs , down
0.4 percent.
 The yen and Swiss franc, along with the dollar, typically
gain when risk aversion is high, while investors tend to avoid
currencies tied more closely to growth or commodity prices,
such as the Australian dollar , which fell 0.5 percent
to $0.8196 on Monday.
 Sterling rose 0.2 percent to $1.4490  while the
euro earlier fell to an 18-month low at 82.12 pence 
as traders said investors were moving out of German bunds and
into UK gilts amid fears of continued debt woes in the euro
zone.
 Traders say the next option trigger for the euro comes at
$1.1850 and a likely target at $1.1825, the euro's March 2006
low. Below that, traders saw little support until its November
2005 low of $1.1638, though the euro's 1999 launch level of
$1.1747 was also a potential key marker.
 But the road there will be a winding one. The euro's ""come
an awfully long way in recent days and it won't head lower in a
straight line,"" said Paul Robson, a currency strategist at RBS
in London.
 DATA BOOST, DEBT WOES PERSIST

reasonable demand at an offer of Belgian government debt were
helping to bolster the euro Monday, market participants said.

crisis. [ID:nLDE6550I7]
 That reignited fears about European banks' exposure to the
debt of some European countries.
 While the problems in Hungary are not considered as severe
as those in Greece, some analysts say it may be more vulnerable
to crisis since it is not in the euro zone and does not use the
euro.
 ""Greece can't devalue or easily default on its debt, but
presumably Hungary can, so it's a double-edged blade,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.

(Updates with IMF chief's comments)
 By Marcin Grajewski and Jan Strupczewski
 LUXEMBOURG, June 7 (Reuters) - The chief of the
International Monetary Fund and euro zone finance ministers
downplayed on Monday market fears that Hungary, which is outside
the single-currency area, could face a debt crisis like Greece.
 ""I see no reason to be ... concerned. They (the Hungarian
government) will do what they have to do. It's difficult,"" IMF
Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn told reporters after
talks with finance ministers from the 16-country euro zone.
 He said the IMF was ready for a meeting with Hungary's new
centre-right government, should Budapest request such talks,
ahead of regular discussions in August that are due to assess
the Fund's loan programme for the country.
 A run on its currency after the global financial crisis
erupted in 2008 forced Budapest to seek a $25 billion rescue
from the European Union and IMF to avoid economic collapse.
Budapest has since stopping drawing on rescue funds.
 ""On our side, we are ready. It depends on the Hungarian
government. I see no reason why it could not happen,"" he said.
 Hungarian government officials spooked markets last week by
suggesting Hungary could face a Greek-style debt scenario but
ministers have rowed back on those comments, insisting a budget
deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP remained their goal.
 Some officials had said earlier that the deficit could reach
7 percent.
 
 TOO MUCH TALK
 A number of euro zone officials also brushed aside market
concerns about Hungary and said Budapest's troubles did not
threaten the currency area.
 ""I do not see any problem at all with Hungary. I only see
the problem that leading politicians from Hungary talk too
much,"" said Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs meetings of euro
zone finance ministers.
 Austrian Finance Minister Josef Proel, asked whether
Hungary's debt situation posed a risk to the euro zone, said: ""I
do not think that Hungary can present a danger.""
 Asked whether Hungary was becoming a new Greece, EU Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said: ""No.""
 Hungary's government vowed to cut spending on Monday to
repair damage from comments last week, but a renewed pledge of
tax cuts kept markets on edge. 
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said the new centre-right
government, which took office on May 29, would stick to the
deficit target of 3.8 percent and needed to cut spending worth
1.0-1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to do so.
 The forint currency bounced off a one-year low and bond
prices rose, suggesting investors' nerves had been soothed to an
extent by promises to cut the deficit although economists said
details of the government's plans were lacking.
 Greece in May became the first euro zone country to require
a financial rescue after Athens said it could no longer afford
to roll over its debt at rates that the markets were demanding.

 * Strong German manufacturing data fails to rally markets
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday as
strong German manufacturing data failed to improve sentiment
after poor U.S. jobs data and debt worries centered around
eastern Europe continued to drive fears about the global
economic recovery.
 The euro hit multi-year lows below $1.19, while safe-haven
investments such as gold and U.S. Treasury securities were
steady to higher as investors remained averse to risk amid
concerns about European sovereign debt.
 Data on Friday showing the U.S. economy generated fewer
jobs than expected in May and comments from Hungarian officials
suggesting the country could face a Greek-style debt crisis had
triggered a flight to safety. [ID:nLDE6550I7]
 Government officials on Monday, however, stressed that
Hungary was not in the same situation as Greece and would meet
budget deficit targets set in an aid deal with the
International Monetary Fund and European Union.
 Germany on Monday reported industrial orders jumped far
more than expected in April, adding to signs that Europe's
largest economy was on the path to durable growth.
[ID:nLDE656107] But the data did little to raise hopes of a
healthy recovery in the world economy.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
down 0.9 percent, off its lows, and its emerging market
counterpart <.MSCIEF> was off 2.2 percent.
 ""There is a lot of nervousness in the market. On the one
hand we have the positive (German manufacturing) data, but
there is also anxiety about Hungary keeping pressure on the
market,"" said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity markets
strategist at Deutsche Postbank.
 U.S. stocks bounced between positive and negative territory
with little news or data to guide the market.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 8.47 points,
or 0.09 percent, at 9,940.44. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was up 0.77 points, or 0.07 percent, at 1,065.65. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 11.57 points, or 0.52
percent, at 2,207.60.
 Investors continued Friday's sell-off after monthly U.S.
jobs data disappointed, adding fewer jobs than expected of
which a large portion were temporary hirings for the U.S.
Census.
 In the long-term however, the weak state of the labor
market may help keep the U.S. economy out of another recession.
Because companies have been reluctant to rehire or expand
despite a growing economy, they have little need for further
cutbacks even if demand falters.
 In the currency market, European corporate demand helped
lift the euro after it fell to $1.1876  ,its weakest
level since March 2006. But the euro remained below $1.20, a
level pierced Friday after Hungary's warning about its deficit
reminded investors of the severe debt problems plaguing some
European countries.[FRX/]
 The euro  was down 0.14 percent at $1.1956 from a
previous session close of $1.1973. Against the Japanese yen,
the dollar  was up 0.11 percent at 92.01 from a previous
session close of 91.910.
 ""After Hungary's warning and weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs
data on Friday, selling got a bit overdone,"" said Amelia
Bourdeau, senior strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Hungary -- a member of the European Union but not the euro
zone -- is of minimal importance on the global level, but there
are concerns about exposure among leading banks if Hungary
defaults or if the fall in the forint currency fuels a rise in
loan delinquency among Hungarians who have borrowed heavily in
euros and Swiss francs.
 It also comes hard on the heels of worries about defaults
in Greece and other southern euro zone members.
 ""Greece can't devalue or easily default on its debt, but
presumably Hungary can, so it's a double-edged blade,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
Euro zone governments will issue about 27.5 billion euros
worth of new bonds this week, with Spain, Portugal and Italy

 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed 1 percent
lower, pressured by BP . The U.S. Coast Guard said the
United States will be dealing with the oil spill from the April
20 rig explosion for another four to six weeks; BP firm plans
to double the amount of oil it is capturing from its ruptured
Gulf of Mexico well to 20,000 barrels per day. [ID:nN07163784]
 Adding to the pressure, Goldman Sachs downgraded the oil
major to ""neutral"" from ""buy.""
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed, keeping yields near
their lowest in almost two weeks as bouncing stocks made it
difficult to convince increasingly risk-averse investors to
part with safe-haven government bonds in large amounts.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
1/32, with the yield at 3.2022 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.746
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down
2/32, with the yield at 4.1361 percent.
 Gold prices  rallied to a three-week peak of
$1,233.75 an ounce as investors took advantage of the dip in
prices to buy the metal as a haven from risk in other markets.

 By Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, June 7 (Reuters) - The forint's falls on Hungarian
debt concerns raise the burden of households on their foreign
currency loans, but the forint is still far from levels where
domestic banks would need significant additional capital.
 Further, sustained forint weakening could however hamper the
economy's recovery and lead to an increase in defaults on
foreign currency loans by Hungarian households, and a rise in
banks' non-performing loan ratios, analysts said on Monday.
 The major foreign banks exposed in the Hungarian banking
sector are Austria's Raiffeisen International, Erste Belgium's
KBC, Germany's Bayerische Landesbank and Italy's Intesa SanPaolo
and UniCredit Group.
 Some analysts pointed out that high unemployment and a
firming of the Swiss franc versus the euro which pushed the
forint past 200 to the Swiss franc was a further risk as the
overwhelming majority of FX loans -- both corporate and
household -- are denominated in Swiss francs.
 Hungarian households held foreign currency loans worth 6,464
billion forints ($26.95 billion) at the end of March, two-thirds
of that in Swiss francs and most of the rest in euros.
 Companies also have a significant FX debt stock.
 The forint fell almost six percent against the euro to a
12-month low of 290.55 last week as highly controversial
comments from government politicians triggered concerns over the
country's solvency.
 
 It recovered to around 285 on Monday after the government
pledged to keep to the 2010 budget deficit target, but financial
markets stayed on edge, waiting for details on the government's
action plan to tackle fiscal issues.
 ""If the forint weakens further, loan instalment payments
grow and households will be left with less money to spend for
consumption,"" said Zsolt Kondrat, an analyst at MKB Bank. ""(But)
we survived 315 (in March 2009) and we are still far from that.
 The forint's all-time low versus the euro was around 317.45
hit in March 2009 and that did not cause systemic problems in
the banking system.
 K&H Bank analyst Gyorgy Barcza said systemic risks in the
banking system would start to grow at weaker forint levels than
315, but capital needs would not surge before levels weaker than
330 if the economy does not sink back into recession.
Eszter Gargyan, economist at Citigroup, said while the
current forint levels versus the euro would not be a problem,
the movement of the Swiss franc versus the euro was something to
be watched along with a rise in unemployment which could lead to
a further rise in banks' non performing loan ratios.
 ""The firming of the Swiss franc versus the euro is a factor
which neither Hungarian economic policy nor monetary policy can
handle,"" she said.
 Hungarian markets fell sharply last week after government
politicians said Hungary had slim chance to avoid a Greek-style
debt crisis. Officials in Hungary and the European Union later
called those comments exaggerated.

 
 STRESS TESTS
 Hungary's public debt near 80 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) is well below the 133 percent projected for Greece
for 2010.
 But Hungary's gross external debt, projected at 132 percent
of GDP this year, is relatively high, because households and
firms borrowed heavily in Swiss franc and euro before the global
crisis, at forint levels which were much firmer than now.
 The central bank (NBH) said in its financial stability
report in April that a forint plunge would trigger gains on the
banking system's currency positions, but could create additional
capital needs due to the defaults of borrowers.
 It said that in a stress scenario in which the forint falls
to 315 per euro, interest rates rise and the economy contracts
by 2.2 percent, Hungarian banks would need additional capital of
up to 50 billion forints ($208.5 million), a manageable amount.
 ""This amount may be regarded as negligible in comparison to
the HUF 2,250 billion of own funds at the aggregate level,"" the
NBH said in April.
 The economy is seen growing by 0.9 percent this year.
 Analysts said the bank, which broke its rate cutting cycle
at its meeting a week ago and kept the base rate at 5.25
percent, would be still worried at levels around 300 forints.
 In a study NBH economists said in March that forint falls to
around 300 would hit economic recovery by eroding banks' loan
books, even though a weaker currency can help exporters.
 Hungarian banks are awash in forint liquidity, but continued
concerns over the country's debt credibility could tighten their
foreign currency liquidity, MKB's Kondrat said.
 The NBH has said the parent banks of Hungary's largely
foreign-owned banking system were strongly committed to stand
behind their Hungarian units, but a prolonged liquidity crisis
could narrow access to foreign currency liquidity.
 ""Therefore we assign key relevance to direct funds provided
through parent bank relations, on the one hand, and fx swaps of
the parents and the central bank, on the other,"" it said.

 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday as
weak U.S. jobs data and debt worries centred around eastern
Europe triggered fears about the global economic recovery,
which also pushed the euro to hit multi-year lows.
 Safe-haven investments such as gold and U.S. Treasury
securities gained ground amid concerns about European sovereign
debt.

recovery may be slowing a little,"" said Hiroaki Osakabe, fund
manager at Chibagin Asset Management in Japan.
 ""Then you have this combined with signs that the euro zone
debt problems may be very deep-rooted. Both of these put
together are sparking selling.""
Though Wall Street initially opened higher, stocks sagged
shortly afterward as appetite for risky assets remained hurt by
recent volatility and worries over Europe's fiscal crisis.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 4.24 points,
or 0.04 percent, at 9,936.21. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> gained 0.47 points, or 0.04 percent, to 1,065.35. The

 Investors sold off shares Friday and continued into Monday
after monthly U.S. jobs data disappointed, adding fewer jobs
than expected of which a large portion were temporary hirings
for the U.S. Census.
 In the currency market, European corporate demand helped
lift the euro after it touched $1.1876 , its weakest
level since March 2006. But it remained below $1.20, a level
pierced Friday after Hungary's warning about its deficit
reminded investors of the severe debt problems plaguing some
European countries.[FRX/]
 ""After Hungary's warning and weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs
data on Friday, selling got a bit overdone,"" said Amelia
Bourdeau, senior strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Hungary itself is of minimal importance on the global
level, but there are concerns about exposure among leading
banks if Hungary defaults or if the fall in the forint fuels a
rise in loan delinquency among Hungarians who have borrowed
heavily in euros and Swiss francs.
 It also comes hard on the heels of worries about defaults
in Greece and other southern euro zone members.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was flat while
Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down 3.84 percent.
 U.S. Treasuries rose as fresh weakness in stocks enhanced
the allure of safe-haven government bonds.

1/32, with the yield at 3.20 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  flat with the yield at 0.743 percent. The
30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up 3/32, with the
yield at 4.128 percent.

 By Rodrigo Campos
 NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open
lower on Friday after a mixed U.S. payrolls report failed to
confirm heightened expectations of a healing labor market.
 The U.S. economy created 103,000 jobs in December, far
below the 175,000 economists had forecast, but the unemployment
rate dropped to 9.4 percent, the lowest since May 2009.
 Overbought levels on the S&P 500 opened the door to the
possibility of declines after payrolls disappointed. Short-term
technical support for the benchmark was found near 1,260, its
14-day moving average. The S&P closed at 1,273.85 on Thursday.
 Economists had revised their forecasts higher after
Wednesday's surprising strong ADP private-sector employment
figures, which were triple forecasts.
 ""The big benefit here is that the unemployment rate dropped
to 9.4 percent. I would categorize this as continued positive
momentum and evidence that the economy is improving and
growing,"" said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg
Financial Services in Suffern, New York.
 S&P 500 futures fell 2.3 points, and were slightly below
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 9
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 1 point.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro stabilised after hitting
a four-year low against the dollar on Monday as a pick-up in
global share prices from early losses prompted some investors to
cover short euro positions.
 European corporate demand helped to lift the euro after it
fell to $1.1876, its weakest since March 2006, but gains were
limited as a warning from Hungary last week about its fiscal
woes reminded investors of the scale of debt problems in Europe.
 The euro stayed on the back foot after tumbling 1.5 percent
against the dollar on Friday, when weaker-than-expected U.S.
jobs data sparked concerns the global economic recovery may be
losing steam and cut demand for riskier assets.
 European shares recovered much of their early losses.
Analysts said equities were finding their footing on the view
that Friday's sell-off may have been overdone.
 This was helping to support the euro, said Geoff Kendrick
senior currency strategist at UBS.
 ""Equities have stabilised, and U.S. futures have turned
positive,"" he said. ""The fears which drove the market lower on
Friday have subsided for now.""
 At 1152 GMT, the euro  was steady at $1.1974, not far
from the day's high of $1.1991 according to Reuters data.
 Traders said demand from corporates and real money accounts
was helping to pull the single currency off its lows, although
many investors see the euro grinding lower in coming weeks as
the euro zone debt problems are expected to stifle the region's
economic recovery.
 A bigger-than-expected jump in German industrial orders and
reasonable demand at an offer of Belgian government debt were
helping to bolster the euro, market participants said.
[ID:nTAR001846] [ID:nLDE656107]
 European shares <.FTEU3> traded 0.3 percent lower, clawing
back ground after hitting their lowest in nearly a week in
earlier trade. U.S stock futures rose 0.2 percent, recovering
from an earlier fall.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was little changed on the day at
88.321. The euro's earlier slide had pushed the U.S. currency to
a 15-month high at 88.708 against a currency basket.
 The euro was unchanged at 109.66 yen , having
earlier hit an 8-1/2-year low of 108.06 yen on the EBS trading
platform. The yen pared gains made in early trade, but was
generally supported as investors continued to favour the
low-yielding currency.
 
 SLOW RECOVERY
 Concerns about public finances in Hungary -- a member of the
European Union, though not the euro zone -- added to market
jitters after comments last week by government officials that
Hungary could face a Greek-style crisis. [ID:nLDE6550I7]
 The Hungarian government downplayed the comments at the
weekend but analysts said the comments had reignited concerns
about whether peripheral euro zone countries will be able to
deliver tough austerity measures, and worries about European
banks' exposure to Hungary.
 ""Euro/dollar is heading lower on a combination of the
Hungary situation and the U.S. jobs data, though it's come an
awfully long way in recent days and it won't head lower in a
straight line,"" said RBS currency strategist Paul Robson.
 G20 finance ministers meeting at the weekend did not voice
any strong concern about the euro's sharp slide on Friday, nor
did euro zone policymakers, further encouraging euro selling,
traders said. [ID:nSGE656024] 
 Weaker-than-expected U.S. payrolls data on Friday reinforced
views the U.S. economic recovery may be slow and could
jeopardise the wider global recovery. [ID:nOAT004640]
 These issues have helped to cut demand for euros. IMM data
on Friday showed net short positions in the single currency
remain high even as some were cut last week. [IMM/FX]

(Adds CEO comments)
 PARIS, June 7 (Reuters) - French luxury group Hermes' sales
in January to May rose slightly faster than the 18.5 percent
growth seen in the first quarter, Chief Executive Patrick Thomas
said on Monday.
 Still, this trend cannot be extrapolated over the full year
as year-earlier comparative figures will be less flattering in
the second half, he told the company's annual shareholder
meeting.
 Hermes posted the biggest surge in first-quarter sales of
all European luxury goods companies last month, pointing to a
continued polarisation of the market in which well-established
brands crush weaker rivals.
 The maker of crocodile handbags and silk scarves said sales
in the three months to March 31 reached 507.7 million euros
($606 million), a 20.2 percent increase at constant currencies.
 The euro is ""at a good price today"", the CEO said, adding
that the weakening of the euro against major currencies would
not impact sales development this year.
 The single European currency reached its lowest level
against the dollar since March 2006 earlier on Monday, touching
$1.1876.
 Hermes is continuing to focus on organic growth, meanwhile,
although Thomas did not rule out making an acquisition if a
""tremendous"" opportunity came along. The group has over 500
million euros in net cash.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Monday from
an earlier slide to a four-year low versus the dollar, but
fiscal troubles in Hungary reminded investors of the scale of
Europe's debt problems and weighed on the single currency.
 After a drop of around 1.5 percent versus the dollar on
Friday followed by more selling early on Monday, traders said
investors were wary of pushing the single currency much lower,
although sentiment remained negative.
 Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data on Friday sparked
concerns about global economic health, and Group of 20 finance
ministers at the weekend highlighted the need to cut deficits as
well as the need to safeguard a fragile recovery. Concerns
about public finances in Hungary -- a member of the European
Union, though not the euro zone -- added to maket jitters after
comments last week by government officials that Hungary could
face a Greek-style crisis.
 Analysts said this reignited concerns about whether
peripheral euro zone countries will be able to deliver tough
austerity measures, and worries about European banks' exposure
to Hungary.
 ""Euro/dollar is heading lower on a combination of the
Hungary situation and the U.S. jobs data, though it's come an
awfully long way in recent days and it won't head lower in a
straight line,"" said RBS currency strategist Paul Robson.
 At 1002 GMT, the euro was steady at $1.1974, having fallen
as low as $1.1876 on the EBS trading platform, its lowest since
March 2006.
 Traders say the next option trigger is at $1.1850 and the
likely target at $1.1825, the euro's March 2006 low. Below that,
traders saw little support until its November 2005 low of
$1.1638, though the euro's 1989 launch level of $1.1747 was also
a potential key marker.
 Data on Friday showed speculators cut net short positions on
the euro in the week to June 1 to a still-high 93,325 contracts
from 106,736. 
 The euro's weakness helped the U.S. dollar index earlier to
a fresh 15-month high of 88.708, eyeing the 2009 high of 89.62,
though it later pared gains to trade flat at 88.255.

 SLOW RECOVERY
 The euro extended a slide begun on Friday, with market
players saying its close below $1.2135, the 50 percent
retracement of its 2000-2008 rally, was a bearish signal.
 A lack of any expression of strong concern at a meeting of
G20 finance ministers over the weekend or from euro zone
policymakers after the euro's steep fall on Friday encouraged
further euro selling, traders said. 
 Data on Friday reinforced views the U.S. economic recovery
may be slow, sparking a fresh bout of risk aversion which pushed
European stocks down on Monday and broadly benefited the yen,
dollar and Swiss franc.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to 109.64 yen, having earlier hit
an 8-1/2-year low of 108.06 yen on EBS. 
 ""The worries about Hungary came at a time when the market is
really sensitive to any negative economic news and it has
affected risk sentiment all over the world,"" said Elisabeth
Andreew, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 Concerns about Hungary's debt caused the cost of insuring
against sovereign default in France and several peripheral euro
zone states to rise on Monday.

 ""We deny that. We are doing that also in order to avoid
damaging our shareholders,"" Chief Executive Ruediger Kapitza
told Reuters. ""Speculators are pitching these rumours,"" he
added.
 Shares in Gildemeister were up 3.5 percent at 8.781 euros by

Gildemeister as a takeover target for Mori Seiki.

 He said the two companies are aiming to raise their combined
market share worldwide to 20 percent within five years from

 Mori Seiki ranks third worldwide and owns 5 percent of
Gildemeister, which in turn holds 2.3 percent of its Japanese
partner.
 Kapitza said on Monday the cross-shareholding between the
two companies, which started last year, is ""symbolic and should
underline the long-term cooperation"" between them.

 By Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, June 7 (Reuters) - Hungary's government vowed to
cut spending on Monday as it strove to repair damage from
officials' comments last week about a possible Greece-style debt
crisis, but a lack of policy detail kept markets on edge.
 Last week's policy stumbles by the new government rocked
Hungarian assets and rattled markets around the globe which were
already hyper-sensitive to sovereign debt risk.
 The forint bounced off a one-year low and bond prices rose
late on Monday, suggesting investors' nerves had been soothed to
an extent by promises to cut the deficit although economists
said details of the government's plans were still lacking.
 The cabinet has promised an action plan by early Tuesday at
the latest.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said the centre-right
Fidesz government, in office since May 29, would stick to a
budget deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP and would need to
cut spending by 1.0-1.5 percent of gross domestic product.
 But he also said the government could introduce a flat
personal income tax for families, lower than current rates --
hard to square with commitments agreed under a 20 billion euro
bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
 Moody's credit rating agency said the government's
willingness to consider unorthodox measures to boost tax revenue
was cause for concern, while other analysts said Fidesz was
still sending mixed messages, a practice which prompted a
currency, stock and bond selloff last week. [ID:nLDE6550I7]
 ""We'll stick to our 3.8 percent budget deficit level for
this year. It was agreed by the IMF and the EU and it was also
agreed by the Hungarian government so there is no doubt about
that, we'll stick to that figure,"" Matolcsy told CNBC.
 He admitted to communication blunders when officials
suggested Budapest could slide towards a similar fate as Athens,
but added ""it is blatant that Hungary is not Greece"".
 Economists said the government appeared to be saying
different things to international and domestic audiences, while
new statements were confusing after Fidesz earlier said this
year's budget deficit could be as high as 7 percent of GDP.
 ""One cannot help being puzzled when Hungarian officials talk
about a much larger than planned budget deficit and at the same
time rule out austerity measures and instead promise tax cuts,""
said Danske Bank analyst Lars Christensen.
 Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker, chairing a meeting of euro
zone finance ministers said: ""I do not see any problem at all
with Hungary. I only see the problem that politicians from
Hungary talk too much."" [ID:nLDE6560NZ]
 
 NOT GREECE
 Fidesz roared to victory in the April election, eclipsing
the former ruling Socialist party whose profligacy in their
first four years of power between 2002-2006 helped lead the
country into fiscal trouble and triggered austerity measures.
 Most economists say Hungary is in a much stronger position
than Greece. Its deficit and debt ratios to GDP are not nearly
as high; public debt was about 80 percent last year, compared
with 133 percent projected for Greece this year. 
 But Moody's said the government's statements and its ideas
on how to boost growth brought new attention to Hungary's still
high public and external debt. [ID:nLDE656196]
 Citing unnamed sources, online portal Index reported the
government was considering levying a special tax on banks and
channelling private pension funds to the state system as a way
to boost revenues.
 Matolcsy told domestic viewers on TV2 television ministers
were examining a 15-20 percent flat tax for families, while
State Secretary Mihaly Varga said the government had made no
decision on a bank tax and had not discussed the pension system.
 He said the government would hold official talks with the
IMF and EU only in August, adding it had looked at financial
institutions, banks, insurers, and leasing firms and was
considering ""what help, it could get from them"".
 ""If the government decides on this issue -- and I stress
that no decision has been made -- then certainly we will work
out the details sitting down with the parties,"" Varga said.
 
 DETAILS
 The doubts over Hungary had helped push the euro  to a
four-year low and temporarily pushed oil 3 percent lower under
the psychological $70 level. [ID:nLDE6560BO] [ID:nSGE655030]
 In Romania, the government cancelled the third bond sale
this month after investors spooked by fears of a fiscal crisis
in neighbouring Hungary and worries over domestic reforms sought
yields Bucharest was unwilling to pay. [ID:nLDE6561V5]
 But in a hesitant vote of confidence on officials' pledge to
stick to the budget target, the forint  had jumped 1.2
percent from Friday's local close by 1413 GMT and the cost of
insuring Hungary's debt against default fell sharply, wiping out
some of the gains to 13-month highs made last week.
 The bank tax talk had helped send shares tumbling 5 percent
on the Budapest bourse, which briefly suspended trading in
leading lender OTP Bank  after its shares shed 10
percent. In line with other market moves, its shares later
clawed back to trade flat on the day.
 Analysts rued the lack of a clear fiscal framework and said
it would take months for Budapest to win back market trust.
 Details from the government's plans are still lacking, and
investors will watch the action plan which the cabinet promised
by early Tuesday, very closely.
 ""They will at the very least want specific details of how
the Hungarian government will seek to comply with promises to EU
and IMF and stabilise the debt ratio,"" UBS researchers said.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday,
hitting its lowest in more than four years against the dollar on
concerns about debt and fragile growth in the euro zone,
exacerbated by worries about Hungary's fiscal situation.
 Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, mounting worries about
the potential dent to euro zone growth from austerity measures
in some countries and concerns Hungary may be the next Greece
prompted investors to dump risky assets.
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar fell as equities and
commodity prices took a knock while traders unwound carry
trades, where money is borrowed in lower-yielding currencies to
fund higher-yielding investments.
 The euro extended a slide begun on Friday, with market
players saying its close below $1.2135, the 50 percent
retracement of its 2000-2008 rally, was a bearish signal.
 The euro also fell to an 8-1/2-year low versus the yen as
investors turned towards the low-yielding Japanese currency, as
well as the dollar and the Swiss franc, as they sought safety.
 A lack of any expression of strong concern at a meeting of
G20 finance ministers over the weekend or from euro zone
policymakers after the euro's steep fall on Friday encouraged
further euro selling, traders said. 
 ""The worries about Hungary came at a time when the market is
really sensitive to any negative economic news and it has
affected risk sentiment all over the world, while the U.S.
non-farm payroll data added to the negative feeling,"" said
Elisabeth Andreew, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 Data on Friday showed speculators cut net shorts on the euro
in the week to June 1 to a still-high 93,325 contracts from
106,736. 
 At 0747 GMT, the euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.1930,
having fallen as low as $1.1876 on the EBS trading platform, its
lowest since March 2006.
 Traders say the next option trigger is at $1.1850 and the
likely target at $1.1825, the euro's March 2006 low.
 Below that, traders see little support until its November
2005 low of $1.1638, though the euro's 1989 launch level of
$1.1747 was also a potential key marker.
 ""There might be a bit of support around the $1.18 handle,
but we expect it to fall to $1.15 eventually,"" said Jonathan
Cavenagh, a currency strategist at Westpac.
 The euro's weakness helped the U.S. dollar index rise 0.3
percent to 88.461, having earlier climbed to a fresh 15-month
high of 88.708, eyeing the 2009 high of 89.62.
 
 SLOW RECOVERY
 The greenback's gains came as data on Friday reinforced
views the U.S. economic recovery may be slow, sparking a fresh
bout of risk aversion which hurt Wall Street. European stocks
were down 1.35 percent .
 The euro traded down 0.7 percent against the yen at 109.21
yen, after earlier tumbling to an 8-1/2-year low of 108.06 yen
on EBS. Japan's leading contender for new finance minister,
Yoshihiko Noda, now a deputy finance minister, told Reuters he
would not comment on currency levels.
 The euro was 0.1 percent lower against the Swiss franc at
1.3898 Swiss francs after tumbling as low as 1.3853 on EBS, a
record low. The euro fell versus the pound to around 82.40 pence, its lowest since November 2008.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday and
the euro hit four-year lows against the dollar as investors
reacted to signs the U.S. economic recovery may be slowing and
to new debt worries centred on eastern Europe.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was
down around 1 percent, off its lows, and its emerging market
counterpart <.MSCIEF> was off 2.3 percent.
 But Wall Street looked set for small gains and European
shares pared losses after better-than-expected German
manufacturing data.
 Investors sold off shares on Friday and continued into
Monday after monthly U.S. jobs data disappointed, adding fewer
jobs than expected while a large portion were temporary hirings
for the U.S. Census.
 That triggered concerns that the recovery in the world's
largest economy is not as robust as believed.
 At the same time, other fears centred on Hungary, where
ruling party officials suggested there was only a slim chance of
it avoiding a Greece-style debt crisis.
 ""The jobs data may have changed market sentiment a bit
because the numbers for this important indicator showed what
people have been suspecting for a while, that the U.S. economic
recovery may be slowing a little,"" said Hiroaki Osakabe, fund
manager at Chibagin Asset Management in Japan.
 ""Then you have this combined with signs that the euro zone
debt problems may be very deep-rooted. Both of these put
together are sparking selling.""
 Hungary itself is of minimal importance on the global level,
but there are concerns about exposure among leading banks if
Hungary defaults or if the fall in the forint fuels a rise in
loan delinquency among Hungarians who have borrowed heavily in
euros and Swiss francs.
 It also comes hard on the heels of worries about defaults in
Greece and other southern euro zone members.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.1
percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down 3.84
percent.
 
 EURO TROUBLE
 The euro fell broadly, hitting its lowest in more than four
years against the dollar. Higher-yielding currencies such as the
Australian dollar also fell as equities and commodity prices
took a knock.
 Market players said the single currency's close below
$1.2135 on Friday, marking a 50 percent retracement of its
2000-2008 rally, was a bearish chart signal and was adding to
the single currency's woes.
 Lack of any expression of strong concerns at a weekend
meeting of G20 finance ministers over the weekend or from euro
zone policymakers also spurred euro selling, traders said.
 ""The worries about Hungary came at a time when the market is
really sensitive to any negative economic news and it has
affected risk sentiment all over the world, while the U.S.
non-farm payroll data added to the negative feeling,"" said
Elisabeth Andreew, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The euro was at $1.1972 .
 On bond markets, core euro zone government futures marked a
record high.

 By Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, June 7 (Reuters) - Hungary will need to cut about
1.0-1.5 percent of GDP off spending to meet an IMF and EU budget
target this year, but the government also needs to kickstart
growth, Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Monday.
 In several appearances as the government strives to repair
damage to its credibility with markets after a sell-off last
week, Matolcsy said Hungary would stick to the 3.8 percent
deficit target agreed with lenders for this year.
 He told CNBC television that there were blunders in
government communication last week, but ""it is blatant that
Hungary is not Greece."" Comments by officials that Budapest's
debt problems gave it a slim chance of avoiding a similar fate
to Athens, knocked the euro back on Friday.
 ""We'll stick to our 3.8 percent budget deficit level for
this year. It was agreed by the IMF and the EU and it was also
agreed by the Hungarian government so there is no doubt about
that, we'll stick to that figure,"" he said.
 ""On the one hand it's clear cut again there is no need to
have an austerity plan -- on the other hand, there is no option
to have a fiscal stimulus package - so we'll have an action plan
on the part of the new government, we'll cut budget expenditures
(and) on the other hand we'll boost revenues.""
 Matolcsy also reiterated that the government plans to cut
taxes. After a meeting of the new centre-right cabinet to
discuss its economic programme at the weekend, it remains
unclear that can be squared with containing the deficit at 3.8
percent.
 ""One can not helped being puzzled when Hungarian officials
talk about a much larger than planned budget deficit and at the
same time rules out austerity measures and instead promises tax
cuts,"" said Danske Bank analyst Lars Christensen.
 Comments by a Fidesz party official and the prime minister's
spokesman comparing Hungary to Greece drove the forint lower
, caused a selloff in government bonds, and helped send the euro
to a four-year low against the dollar on Friday.
 At the weekend, top government officials launched an attempt
at damage control, describing comparisons to Greece as
""exaggerated"" and insisting Hungary would aim to meet the
deficit target.
 Matolcsy, speaking on CNBC, said that by the end of May, the
budget deficit had reached 87 percent of the full-year target
but the government will keep the deficit under control. And
while there was no need for an austerity package, having a
fiscal stimulus package was not an option now.
 
 FORINT UP
 The forint rose more than half a percent in morning trade.
 Most economists say Hungary is in a much stronger position
than Greece. Its deficit and debt ratios to GDP are not nearly
as high; public debt was about 80 percent last year, compared to
133 percent projected for Greece this year. It also ran a
current account surplus last year and had a budget gap of 4
percent after deep spending cuts.
 The government started a three-day meeting on Saturday and
is expected to decide on an action plan by the end of Monday.
 Matolcsy said the government was examining possibilities for
a flat tax of between 15-20 percent in personal income taxation
which should be linked with family taxation.
 ""As we see now, and the government is preparing to make such
a decision, that from Jan. 1, 2011, a flat family tax could be
introduced and finalised over a period of two years,"" Matolcsy
told TV2 television.
 Matolcsy also said there was a proposal on the government's
table which would abolish up to one-fifth of 58 different types
of taxes existing now and he hoped a radical three-year tax
cutting programme could be launched already this year.

 By Rie Ishiguro and Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, June 7 (Reuters) - The leading contender to become
Japan's new finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said on Monday he
wants to set a path for fiscal reform, a sign that he shares
Prime Minister-elect Naoto Kan's zeal to fix the country's
tattered finances.
 Kan, a fiscal conservative with an image as a challenger to
the status quo, was elected as Japan's next premier on Friday and
Japanese media say he will choose Noda as finance minister when
he forms a cabinet on Tuesday.
 Succeeding unpopular Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who quit
last week ahead of an upper house election expected in July, Kan
and his new finance minister will be under market scrutiny over
how serious they are about reining in public debt, now around
twice the size of the economy.
 ""As finance minister (Kan) is set to become prime minister,
we want to set a path for fiscal reform,"" Noda, who is deputy
finance minister, told Reuters.
 Kan is expected to hold his first news conference as prime
minister at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) on Tuesday.
 Financial markets do not expect any major shift in economic
policy as Kan hands over the finance ministry baton.
 The looming election could also keep Kan from promising bold
reforms due to opposition from many within his party to any talk
of tax hikes or big spending cuts, some analysts say.
 But markets hope that under Kan, seen as having a better grip
on economic affairs than Hatoyama, the government will get more
serious about taking bolder steps to rein in public debt. Its
first task will be to come up with a long-term fiscal reform plan
by June as scheduled.
 ""Kan will probably seek balanced fiscal reform, one that
doesn't end up hurting the economy. He understands the lessons
Japan learned in the past, when the drive for fiscal discipline
came at a bad time and pushed the economy in a deep downturn,""
said Naoki Iizuka, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
 ""Markets so far aren't moving much on news of Japan's new
premier. But Kan's policies are quite stock-market friendly.
He'll seek an end to deflation, want a weak yen and will wait for
the right timing in restoring Japan's fiscal health.""
 Aside from mapping out the long-term fiscal reform plan, Noda
will also have to steer debate on the contentious issue of
whether and when Japan should raise the sales tax from the
current 5 percent.
 Koichiro Genba, the Democrats' new policy chief, said the
party should include in its upper house campaign platform that it
will overhaul Japan's tax system, including the sales tax, after
a general election that must be held by 2013.
 Economists say any tax reform would include an increase in
Japan's sales tax to pay for growing social security costs as the
population rapidly ages.
 Genba also told reporters on Monday that it was important for
the country to beat deflation.
 Japan's economy emerged from recession last year and grew at
its fastest pace in three quarters in January-March, outpacing
the euro zone and United States.
 The Cabinet Office said Japan's latest economic trough, or
the bottom of the downturn, was in March 2009, marking the end of
a period of contraction that lasted for 17 months.
 But analysts say the recovery is fragile with domestic demand
still weak. The European debt crisis and an ensuing yen rise
against the euro may also hurt the export-reliant economy.
 The currency market is therefore keen to see if Kan's
government will take a tougher stance on yen strength, but asked
about renewed euro selling against the yen, Noda told Reuters: ""I
won't comment on currency levels.""
 The euro fell to its lowest in more than four years against
the dollar and hit an 8-1/2-year low against the yen on Monday as
short-term players sold it on increasing worries about the euro
zone's debt crisis.
 Credit ratings agencies have threatened to cut Japan's
sovereign debt rating unless it comes up with a credible plan to
rein in its public debt, which is the biggest among major
industrial nations.
 Noda, 53, has echoed Kan's calls for new bond issuance for
the fiscal year from next April to be capped at the record 44.3
trillion yen ($482 billion) earmarked for this year.
 Genba also said 44.3 trillion yen was a ""good target.""

 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday,
hitting its lowest in more than four years against the dollar
with investors increasingly nervous about more slides in the
currency after a clear break below a support point on charts.
 Market players said the euro's close on Friday below a 50
percent retracement of its 2000-2008 rally at $1.2135 was seen as
a bearish chart signal, adding to the single currency's woes.
 The euro fell to an 8-½ year trough versus the yen as
mounting worries about the region's debt problems drove investors
to sell the single currency.
 Investors dumped riskier assets such as the higher-yielding
Australian dollar and unwound leveraged carry trades, moving
funds to the U.S. dollar, the yen and the Swiss franc, considered
safe-haven assets in times of volatility.
 The euro fell to its lowest point on record against the Swiss
franc as more market players chased the euro down after it
cracked below 1.40 francs on Friday in the absence of Swiss
central bank efforts to stem strength in its currency.
 Investors were aggressively removing themselves from risk on
a number of factors such as mounting worries about Hungary and
the euro zone, disappointing U.S. jobs numbers and falling
commodity prices.
 Lack of any expression of strong concerns at a meeting of G20
finance ministers over the weekend or from euro zone policymakers
after the euro's fall below a key chart support around $1.20-1.21
on Friday also encouraged market players to sell the euro more,
traders said.
 ""Europe's sovereign debt problems are just not going away and
it's difficult to see a light at the end of tunnel for it just
yet,"" said Jonathan Cavenagh, a currency strategist at Westpac.
 ""There might be a bit of support around the $1.18 handle, but
we expect it to fall to $1.15 eventually.""
 The market's near-term focus will on comments from euro zone
policymakers with the euro now clearly in a downtrend, and how
the European Central Bank will deal with the deepening euro debt
crisis when it holds a policy-setting meeting later in the week,
a proprietary trader for a Japanese bank said.
 The euro fell as low as $1.1876 on the EBS trading platform,
having fallen past $1.1900 in early Asian trade when more
stop-loss selling was triggered.
 Traders say the next option trigger is at $1.1850 and the
likely target at $1.1825, the euro's March 2006 low.
 The euro came under fresh pressure last last week on growing
concerns that Hungary could be facing a Greek-style debt crisis..
 Also weighing on the euro were comments by French Prime
Minister Francois Fillon on exchange rates.
 Fillon said he was unconcerned by the current level of the
euro to the dollar and saw only ""good news"" in the parity between
the two currencies. Later the remarks were clarified saying his
reference to ""parity"" was about the general evolution of the
exchange rate between the euro and the dollar..
 The euro's weakness helped the U.S. dollar index climb to a
fresh 15-month high of 88.708, eyeing the 2009 high of 89.62.
 The greenback's gains came despite disappointing U.S. jobs
numbers on Friday.
 U.S. employers created 431,000 jobs in May, the Labor
Department said, below the 513,000 predicted by analysts polled
by Reuters. The jobless rate fell more than expected to 9.7
percent from 9.9 percent in April.
 The jobs data reinforced views the U.S. economic recovery may
be slow, leading to a fresh bout of risk aversion which hurt Wall
Street, followed by tumbles in Asian stock markets on Monday.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.8 percent to 91.10 yen,
having fallen more than 1 percent on Friday.
 Traders said some yen short positions, built last week when
expectations grew that Japan's Prime Minister-elect Naoto Kan may
take a tougher stance on fighting yen strength, were cut as the
yen jumped against the euro.
 The euro tumbled to an 8-1/2-year low of 108.06 yen on EBS
before trading at 108.32 yen, down 1.4 percent on the day.
Japan's leading contender for new finance minister, Yoshihiko
Noda, who is deputy finance minister, told Reuters he would not
comment on currency levels.
 The euro was 0.3 percent lower against the Swiss franc at
1.3874 Swiss francs, after tumbling as low as 1.3853 on EBS, a
record low. The euro fell versus the pound to around 82.40 pence,
its lowest since November 2008.
 Meanwhile, the Australian and New Zealand dollars were under
pressure, having endured a big sell-off on Friday.
 The Aussie fell 1.5 percent to $0.8112. Charts indicate a
repeated failure to sustain a bounce above 85 cents would mean
the Aussie was headed lower with support around $0.8065. The New
Zealand dollar was likewise down 1.4 percent at $0.6620.

 SYDNEY, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro sank to four-year lows
on Monday and stocks and commodities fell as increasing market
volatility prompted investors to shed even more risky bets.
 Disappointing U.S. jobs data on Friday and fears that euro
zone debt problems were worsening spurred already nervous
investors to face up to the risk the recovery of the world

 The sell-off looked set to persist in Europe, with
financial spreadbetters expecting Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE

 NO RESPITE YET FOR EURO
 Friday's U.S. economic data had showed the recovery in the
labour market was not as strong as hoped, with hiring by U.S.
private employers slowing sharply in May.
 Although some analysts said cautious hiring by U.S. firms
did not herald another recession in the U.S. economy, the
world's largest, stock investors paid no heed. Major U.S. stock
indexes fell by up to 3.6 percent on Friday.
 Some investors were particularly disappointed by the U.S.
jobs data because they had counted on a strong showing to
offset bad news around Europe's sovereign debt problems.
 World leaders at a G20 meeting over the weekend appeared to

 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro extended losses on
Monday, falling to its lowest in more than four years as mounting
worries about the region's debt problems drove investors to sell
the single currency and stay away from high-yielders.
 Investors dumped riskier assets and unwound leveraged carry
trades, moving funds to the U.S. dollar and the yen ,
considered safe-haven assets in times of strife.
 They were aggressively taking risk off the table on a number
of factors like mounting worries about Hungary and the euro zone,
disappointing U.S. jobs numbers and falling commodity prices.
 In Asian trade, the euro  fell to as low as $1.1921,
according to the EBS trading platform, having fallen past $1.1950
in early Asian trade when stop-loss selling was triggered.
Traders say the next option trigger is at $1.1850.
 ""Europe's sovereign debt problems are just not going away and
it is difficult to see a light at the end of tunnel for it just
yet,"" said Jonathan Cavenagh, currency strategist at Westpac.
""There might be a bit of support around the $1.18 handle, but we
expect it to fall to $1.15 eventually.""
 Traders said the euro's daily close below the 50 percent
retracement of the 2000-2008 euro rally at $1.2135 was seen as a
bearish chart signal, adding to the single currency's woes.
 The euro came under fresh pressure last last week on growing
concerns that Hungary could be facing a Greek-style debt crisis.
[ID:nLDE65306M]. Also weighing on the euro were comments by
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon on exchange rates.
 Fillon said he was not concerned by the current level of the
euro to the dollar and that he saw only ""good news"" in the parity
between the two currencies. Later the remarks were clarified
saying his reference to ""parity"" was about the general evolution
of the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar.
[ID:nWEA4967].
 The euro's weakness helped the U.S. dollar index <.DXY> climb
to a fresh 15-month high of 88.50. The greenback's gains came
despite disappointing U.S. jobs numbers on Friday.
 U.S. employers created 431,000 jobs in May, the Labor
Department said, below the 513,000 predicted by analysts polled
by Reuters. The jobless rate fell more than expected to 9.7
percent from 9.9 percent in April. [ID:nOAT004640]
 The jobs data reinforced the view the U.S. economic recovery
may be slow, leading to a fresh bout of risk aversion which
slugged Wall Street <.SPX> and commodities <.CRB>.
 Against the yen, the dollar was steady at at 91.63 yen
, having fallen more than 1 percent on Friday. The euro/yen
 was on the defensive at 109.66 yen, not far from recent
lows of 108.78 yen struck on May 25.
 The euro was also sharply lower on the Swiss franc at 1.3900
, after tumbling from 1.4090 on Friday.
 Meanwhile, the Australian  and New Zealand dollars
 were under pressure, having endured a big sell-off on
Friday.
 The Aussie  was trading below $0.8200, having sunk
from a $0.8477 high early Friday to break support at $0.8280 in
the process.
 Charts indicate a repeated failure to sustain a bounce above
85 cents would mean the Aussie was headed lower with support
around $0.8065. The New Zealand dollar likewise down at $0.6678
, having slid from a $0.6864 peak on Friday. Some support
at $0.6680 but risk is for a retreat toward 66 cents.

that formed a government last month in Hungary after winning
parliamentary elections by a landslide in April.
 Here are some key facts about the Fidesz party and what is
known about its programme:
 
 * Initially an anti-communist liberal party, Fidesz is now
centre-right, pro-church and pro-family. It wants to attract
foreign investment but favours supporting domestic entrepreneurs
and farmers, and wants to improve competitiveness via tax cuts.
 * Fidesz won elections in April, giving it 263 out of 386
Parliament seats, a supermajority that authorises it to enact
deep reforms and even change the Constitution. [ID:nLDE63L1O6]
 * It is led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, 47, who was also
premier from 1998 to 2002.
 * The party, seen as fiscally conservative during its last
term in power, won the elections on promises of tax cuts. It
warned repeatedly that the 2010 budget deficit could be double
the targeted 3.8 percent of GDP, set in Hungary's financing deal
with the International Monetary Fund and European Union.
 * It said it would rewrite the 2010 budget to boost economic
growth and create a million jobs in 10 years. It has not tabled
a detailed economic programme, which has kept investors
uncertain. [ID:nLDE64Q166]
 * Fidesz officials ignited a broad sell-off of Hungarian and
European assets on Thursday and Friday by saying Hungary had
only a slim chance of avoiding a Greek-style debt crisis.
[ID:nN04140239]
 * The party backtracked on those remarks on Saturday, with a
top official calling them ""exaggerated"" and ""unfortunate"" and
saying Hungary would strive to meet the 3.8 percent deficit
target this year. [ID:nLDE65406W]
 * Fidesz has said it aims to seek a new financing deal with
the IMF and the EU. [ID:nLDE63E0OA]
 * Fidesz has said it would cut taxes to favour families and
job creation, but has been tight-lipped about the type of tax
modifications or their timing. It said a 16 percent flat income
tax was one alternative to examine. [ID:nBUD005357]

(Adds further Juncker comments, background)
 By Sudip Kar-Gupta
 PARIS, June 6 (Reuters) - The chairman of the Eurogroup of
euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, dismissed
concerns on Sunday that Hungary might face a Greek-style debt
crisis and said the current level of the euro did not worry him.
 ""The situation in Hungary doesn't worry me,"" Juncker, who
chairs the regular monthly meetings of euro zone finance
ministers, told TV5 Monde and Radio France Inter in an interview
due to be broadcast later on Sunday.
 Fears of a Hungarian debt crisis pushed the euro to a
four-year low against the dollar on Friday and reignited
concerns that more Eastern European nations could reveal
financial frailties.
 However, Hungary's government said on Saturday it aimed to
meet this year's budget deficit target and described talk of a
debt crisis as ""exaggerated.""
 Juncker, who is also Prime Minister of Luxembourg, also said
he was not worried by the current level of the euro, although he
had been taken aback by the speed at which the euro has recently
fallen.
 He backed calls from European politicians for Europe to have
its own ratings agency, following criticism of rating agencies
for their role in the global credit crisis.
 Juncker also said he felt that China's yuan currency was
undervalued, echoing similar criticism of China's monetary
policy from other politicians.
 China's currency policies were spared a specific mention in
the Group of 20 communique on Saturday, but U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner and the International Monetary Fund
kept up pressure for a stronger yuan.
 On June 3, Juncker said that steps taken by euro zone
members to deal with their debt crisis would be sufficient if
markets understood them and governments treated seriously the
conditions under which help is provided.

 LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron has signalled that growth forecasts would be revised
down while welfare bills and public sector pay would be high on
the target list for spending cuts, the Sunday Times reported.
 The newspaper quoted Cameron, a Conservative who came to
power in May, as saying that there were ""serious problems"" with
the forecast of 3 percent growth in 2011 inherited from the
previous administration.
 ""There is a huge amount of debt that has got to be dealt
with. Crossing our fingers, waiting for growth and hoping it
will go away is simply not an option,"" he was quoted as saying
in an interview due to be published on Sunday.
 Excerpts were sent to media late on Saturday.
 Britain's budget deficit ballooned during the economic
downturn due to lower fiscal revenues and higher welfare bills,
reaching 156 billion pounds ($228 billion) in the past fiscal
year, or about 11 percent of Gross Domestic Product.
 ""You have to address the massive welfare bills. You have to
address public sector pay bills. You have to address the size of
the bureaucracy that has built up over the past decade,"" Cameron
was quoted as saying.
 ""Otherwise you will have to make reductions across the board
which you don't want to do. We need to address the areas where
we have been living beyond our means.""
 Without giving quotes to that effect from Cameron, the
Sunday Times said measures being considered included benefit
freezes, cuts in tax credits for families with children and
freezes or severe restrictions on public service pay increases.
 Cameron said he would work to make the public understand why
the measures were necessary. 
 His Conservative Party has been saying for a long time that
Britain needed to rein in spending in order to avert a downgrade
of its AAA credit rating, which would in turn raise the cost of
borrowing for government.
 ""Proper statesmanship is taking the right action, explaining
to people the purpose behind the pain ... We have got to take
people with us on this difficult journey,"" he said.
 George Osborne, the finance minister, is due to unveil an
emergency budget on June 22.
 The government, a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats, has already announced 6.2 billion pounds of cuts for
this year, but Osborne's budget is expected to contain details
of greater cuts stretching further into the future.

 * Markets expected to firm on prospects of stronger ties

 By Ralph Jennings
 TAIPEI, June 5 (Reuters) - The low turnout at a
demonstration in Taiwan on Saturday against a trade pact with
China pointed to broad but guarded acceptance of the deal by the
Taiwanese public.
 The 10,000 who attended Saturday's demonstration in the
southern city of Kaohsiung, an opposition stronghold, fell far
short of the 50,000 to 100,000 who rallied in previous years
against overtures to Beijing by the China-friendly Taiwanese
government.
 Political analysts said the size of the protest, a month
after a sit-in in Taipei attracted only a few hundred, was an
indication that Taiwan's public accepted the deal, wanted to
know more details or believed the government was deaf to
protests.
 The pact with China, known as the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA), is expected to boost the island's
$390 billion export-led economy.
 Stronger opposition, and possible delays to the pact as a
result, would cool Taiwan markets which are otherwise expected
to firm on prospects of stronger ties between Taiwan and
economic powerhouse neighbour.
 Analysts say much of the public wants a deal of some kind
and is keeping quiet until the details and effects become
clearer.
 ""You're shooting a very vague target through a dense fog,""
Alexander Huang, strategic studies professor at Tamkang
University in Taipei, said of the protests. ""And at the bottom
of your heart you want a better Taiwan and a better economy.""
 The ECFA would boost about $100 billion in annual two-way
trade by reducing tariffs on 300 items, but some Taiwanese fear
it would flood the island with chear Chinese goods, costing
Taiwanese jobs, or lead to a dependence on political rival
Beijing, which claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan.
 An official of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
which organised Saturday's demonstration, said some of those
attending were more concerned about the rejection by Taiwanese
officials of a petition to hold a referendum on the ECFA than
because of the deal itself.
 ""The opposition has a tough time selling the idea that ECFA
is a bad thing for Taiwan per se without knowing what is being
discussed and included,"" said Raymond Wu, managing director of
the Taipei-based political risk consultancy e-telligence.

 * Trade talks need ""quantum of political energy""
 
 By Yoko Kubota
 SAPPORO, Japan, June 5 (Reuters) - Regional trade
negotiations are a good idea so long as they do not sap energy
from the main Doha round of world trade talks, the World Trade
Organisation's head said on Saturday.
 Regional trade deals are gaining impetus while the WTO's
Doha round has stalled. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said he
was monitoring the progress of regional deals to make sure there
was political momentum left for Doha.
 ""As long as it doesn't divert political energy, it's fine,""
he told Reuters when asked about the Asia-Pacific trade pacts.
 ""But this is something which we need to watch. The capacity
of people to negotiate is not unlimited -- there is a capacity
problem,"" Lamy said on the sidelines of a meeting of trade
ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Japan.
 ""I am concerned. I am watching this carefully because we
know that we need a quantum of political energy in these trade
issues and we need a large part of that to conclude the round.""
 The Doha round was launched in 2001 to correct some of the
imbalances in the global trading system and help poor countries
prosper through trade.
 Under a current draft deal, rich countries would lift
barriers to their food markets and cut trade-distorting farm
subsidies while developing countries, excluding the poorest,
would open their markets to more products and services.
 However, agreement on an overall package has proved elusive,
with the United States arguing that big emerging economies such
as Brazil, China and India should do more to facilitate a deal.
 Trade ministers of the 21-member APEC group, meeting in
northern Japan, discussed the goals of regional trade as well as
the stalled Doha discussions.
 Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kazuo Kodama said there
was a sense of urgency to push forward the Doha negotiations.
 However, Michael Punke, the U.S. representative at the WTO,
said he did not sense a substantive move.
 ""I think there's still some question about whether there is
a willingness on a part of all parties to engage in
negotiations,"" he told Reuters. ""The bottom line is that there
is a lot of hard work ahead of us.""
 The WTO has forecast world trade will expand by 9.5 percent
this year after falling by 12.2 percent in 2009.

 BUSAN, South Korea, June 5 (Reuters) - China's currency
policies were spared a specific mention in the Group of 20
communique on Saturday, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner and the IMF kept up up pressure for a stronger yuan.
 Both in a letter to G20 colleagues and comments after the
conclusion of their meetings here, Geithner characterized a more
flexible yuan exchange rate as a central and necessary component
of rebalancing the global economy.
 He said China had ambitious reform plans aimed at
strengthening domestic consumption so it could rely less on
exports for its growth.
 ""A necessary part of that process of reform, and the Chinese
leaders have acknowledged this and recommitted to this, is to
resume what they call the reform of their exchange rate
mechanism,"" Geithner told a news conference in South Korea's main
port city.
 International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn joined Geithner in pointing out that China's
currency, also known as the renminbi, was too weak.
 ""The IMF still believes that the renminbi is still
substantially undervalued...even a revaluation of 20-25 percent
doesn't solve all the imbalances and you have more to do, so it's
only part of the problem and you still have other imbalances,
Strauss-Kahn told reporters.
 After allowing the yuan to strengthen gradually over three
years from about 8.28 to the dollar in July 2005 to 6.83 in July
2008, the Chinese authorities virtually pegged it to the dollar
in 2008 to help exporters weather the global financial storm.
 Beijing has resisted pressure from manufacturers and
lawmakers in Western countries to unshackle the yuan and let it
appreciate in line with China's growing economic strength.
 SOFTER APPROACH
 Geithner in recent months has taken a softer approach on
pressing China to move towards a market-determined yuan rate,
saying it was ""China's choice,"" to do so.
 In April, he postponed a much-anticipated U.S. Treasury
report on whether China was manipulating its currency, preferring
instead to use international gatherings, such as last month's
U.S.-China economic talks and G20 summits to lobby Beijing for
change.
 But lack of action by a summit of G20 leaders later this
month in Toronto could prompt some U.S. lawmakers to push for
punitive trade sanctions against China.
 Europe's debt crisis, which has prompted a steep drop in the
euro , has caused markets to dampen their expectations for
a stronger yuan anytime soon. Yuan offshore forwards, or
non-deliverable forwards  now price in barely any yuan
appreciation in the next 12 months.
 But U.S. Treasury officials want to keep the focus on the
yuan as a key component of the rebalancing debate, as many
economists do not believe that trade and financial imbalances can
shift without it.
 ""Within the G-20, we discussed how the ongoing shift toward
higher savings in the United States would need to be complimented
by stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and in the European
surplus countries, and sustained growth in private demand,
together with a more flexible exchange-rate policy, in China,""
Geithner said in a statement delivered in Busan.
 Beijing shot back with an admonishment for rich nations to
take ""effective measures"" to tackle their tepid growth and fiscal
woes.
 The official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese finance
minister Xie Xuren after the G20 meeting as urging developed
economies to ""maintain basic stability among the major reserve
currencies"".
 He urged policy makers to keep an eye on inflationary and
fiscal risks, while seeking to restore growth, Xinhua said.

 Medvedev said he was confident the EU would be able to cope

 ""If today, you remove this pillar from the global financial

 ""The G20 meeting will above all address the question of

 By Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, June 5 (Reuters) - Hungary's government said on
Saturday it aimed to meet this year's budget deficit target,
seeking to draw a line under ""exaggerated"" talk of a possible
Greek-style debt crisis that has unnerved global markets.
 State secretary Mihaly Varga, leading a review of the
country's public finances, said Hungary's previous socialist
governments had hidden the true extent of the fiscal shortfall,
and that additional measures would be needed to reach the 3.8
percent of GDP goal agreed with international lenders.
 Analysts welcomed the government's intention to meet the
target, which they said should calm markets somewhat on Monday,
although details were needed and any tax cuts should be offset
by spending cuts. The market consensus for this year's deficit
is 5 percent.
 They also said the government would need to work hard to
restore credibility in its policies following a spate of
contradictory comments on fiscal issues.
 Fears of a Hungarian debt crisis pushed the euro to a
four-year low on Friday after a ruling party official said the
country had only a slim chance of avoiding Greece's fate, and
the prime minister's spokesman said he supported this view.
 ""Those comments ... are exaggerated, and if a colleague
makes them it is unfortunate,"" Varga told a news conference.
 ""The situation is consolidated, and the planned deficit
(target) is attainable, but for it to be attainable the
government must take measures.""
 He said some tax revenues were lower than planned in the
current budget and several spending items higher or not included
at all.
 ""We must state that the (recent) Bajnai government, similar
to the Gyurcsany government in 2006, ... did not present a
credible picture of the real state of the country,"" Varga said.
 Asked repeatedly if it could be stated that Hungary was not
close to default, Varga said: ""Any comparison with countries
with much higher CDSs (debt risk profiles) is unfortunate. These
do not give a credible picture of the state of Hungary ...""
 He said the government would come up with an action plan at
a meeting ending on Monday.
 Varga later told MTI news agency he trusted that decisions
on the economy would be made on Monday and made public either on
Monday, or by Tuesday morning the latest.
 Varga declined to give an estimate for the 2010 deficit but
said the government did aim to meet the 3.8 percent target
agreed with the IMF and the European Union, which rescued
Hungary from financial collapse in October 2008.
 ""Calmly, but firmly, we must prepare an action plan as soon
as possible, a series of measures that can help us attain the
deficit target,"" he said. ""The Hungarian economy needs
immediate, urgent measures.""

 EXPLANATIONS SOUGHT
 Hungary's new centre-right government, sworn in a week ago
after winning elections in April, has so far not put forward a
clear economic plan, saying only it wants to cut taxes and
create jobs to boost growth.
 Financial markets and investors had initially welcomed the
new administration, saying its strong mandate -- a two-thirds
parliamentary majority -- would encourage it to carry out much
needed structural reforms in the inefficient state sector.
 But damage done this week by comments that seemed to show
up profound divisions within the government over how to tackle
the fiscal conundrum will take time to repair, analysts said.
 The European Commission warned Hungary on Thursday against
losing the confidence of markets after talks with Prime Minister
Viktor Orban, and urged it to accelerate fiscal consolidation.
 The mixed messages from the government suggested it either
wanted to backtrack on earlier promises of deep tax cuts, or set
the domestic stage for potentially painful spending cuts or
reforms, some analysts said. 
 Others said the government had failed to anticipate the
market impact of chasing a domestic political agenda.
 ""We believe that yesterday's dramatic comments were intended
for domestic consumption and were used to build a dramatic
backdrop that would let Fidesz backtrack on a large share of its
campaign promises and broadly continue with the fiscal policies
of the previous government, as well as preparing the ground for
another round of IMF talks,"" Goldman Sachs said.
 Hungarian political scientist Richard Szentpeteri Nagy of
think tank Meltanyossag told Reuters: ""(Ruling party Fidesz) had
to sketch out some economic nightmare scenarios.
 ""The motivation behind this was domestic, and not the
careful, well thought-out public comments that would be correct
in the international world.""

 CREDIBLE PROGRAMME NEEDED
 The IMF's mission chief is expected in Hungary for informal
talks next week. Varga said it would not be an official review.
The last regular review was in February.
 Local news website portfolio.hu said the IMF mission chief
would arrive on Monday.
 Hungary has not drawn on any IMF funds this year so far, but
the new government has said it wanted to seek a new deal with
lenders because the current financing deal expires by October.
 Analysts said programme details were needed and tax cuts may
be delayed.
 ""The 3.8 percent target is achievable only if the government
... cuts spending or raises revenues. I don't think that tax
cuts are possible in this situation,"" Zoltan Torok at Raiffeisen
said.
 Hungary had a deficit of 4 percent in 2009 at the price of
deep spending cuts that exacerbated a recession but rebuilt
market confidence.
 The finance minister of the previous government said there
were risks attached to the 2010 budget but the target could be
met with tight fiscal policy.

 BUSAN, South Korea, June 5 (Reuters) - Britain's new finance
minister George Osborne claimed a first success on the
international financial stage on Saturday after a shift in G20
language that he said backed his budget plans and bolstered other
European countries seeking to cut deficits.
 Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20 group
of developed and emerging economies met in the South Korean port
of Busan on Friday and Saturday to plan coordinated economic
policies and proposals for tougher financial regulation before a
summit of G20 leaders in Toronto later this month.
 The meeting was Osborne's first appearance at a global
financial forum since he became finance minister after Britain's
May 6 election, in which his Conservative Party came first after
campaigning on a platform of faster action to cut Britain's
record deficit.
 In the wake of Greece's financial crisis, the new government
pushed to speed up budget deficit cuts, starting in the current
financial year, even as the economy is only just emerging from
recession. Osborne said the post-meeting statement was a note of
G20 approval for Britain's plans. 
 It did not name Britain specifically, but supported ""recent
announcements by some countries"" about spending cuts to take
effect in 2010 and stronger national monitoring bodies -- a
probable reference to the Office of Budget Responsibility created
by Osborne.
 ""I think we've achieved a significant success by getting the
endorsement of the G20 for the fiscal position we adopted just
three weeks ago,"" he told a news conference after the meeting.
 Moreover, Osborne said G20 also offered backing to euro zone
countries pushing through unpopular austerity programmes.
 ""From my conversations with other participants there's been a
notable change of tone,"" he said. ""The new British government has
contributed to changing the tone at the G20 and making sure we're
focused on these issues of countries with high deficits. The G20
communique will help some of the governments in the euro zone who
face these challenges stick to their course.""

294,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2010 06:15AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-German FinMin: varied priorities in G20 on deficits," BUSAN, South Korea, June 5 (Reuters) - There are
""differences of opinion"" within the G20 on the extent to which
deficit reduction is a priority, German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Saturday.
 Schaeuble said the Group of 20 industrial and emerging
economies had agreed on the need for a ""determined
consolidation"" but the United States and other countries had
focused primarily on strengthening demand to sustain growth.
 In a letter he sent to ministers on Thursday, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner said global growth would fall short
of potential unless the rest of the world made up for a drop in
aggregate demand caused by a rise in U.S. savings as
debt-strapped households tighten their belts.
 Geithner singled out the need for ""European surplus
countries"" -- code principally for export powerhouse Germany --
to ensure sustained growth in domestic demand.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned
against large imbalances between countries with large trade
surpluses and those with high deficits.
 But deficit spending is anathema to most German politicians
and voters, and Schaeuble has insisted on prioritising fiscal
consolidation, particularly from 2011.
 ""I made no bones about the fact that I share the IMF's
underlying philosophy only in a very limited way,"" he said.
 Schaeuble said that if Europe were considered as a whole
rather than as individual countries, it did not contribute to
global imbalances. ""I advocated considering Europe or at least
the euro zone as a whole,"" he added.
 Schaeuble said there had been no agreement on the question
of a global bank levy or a financial market tax: ""I pointed out
that we need a decision on this (the participation of banks in
the costs of the crisis) in Toronto"".
 The G20 has abandoned a proposal for a global levy -- an
idea that had been opposed by Canada, Australia, Brazil and
India -- but agreed that the financial sector should make a
""fair and substantial contribution"" towards any future
government bailouts.
 To that end, leaders will be asked to endorse a set of
policy options when they meet in Canada later this month.

 By David Lawder and James Pomfret
 BUSAN, South Korea, June 5 (Reuters) - The International
Monetary Fund believes global growth will suffer if the Group of
20 rich and developing economies fail to coordinate efforts to
rebalance global demand, IMF officials said on Saturday.
 Coordinated policies to encourage savings and cut budget
deficits in wealthy countries such as the United States and to
spur domestic demand in developing economies like China could
boost growth substantially.
 Speaking at the end of a G20 summit for finance ministers and
central bank governors in the Southern Korean port city of Busan,
the IMF's managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he was
also ""totally comfortable"" with a final communique calling for
troubled euro zone countries to accelerate fiscal consolidation.
 ""They have to consolidate strongly even if it has some bad
effect on growth,"" he said, referring to Greece and other
southern European countries saddled with huge debts.
 ""Some countries have to go back rapidly to normalcy. Some
others may go on with letting the stimulus expire by its own.""
 An IMF report presented at the G20 meeting earlier estimates
that coherent adoption of the adjustment policies could increase
global growth by as much as 2.5 percent annually over a
medium-term five year period.
 Strauss-Kahn said 30 million extra jobs could be created
with these policy moves.
 Last September, the G20 leaders pledged to take steps to
rebalance global growth to eliminate huge trade surpluses in Asia
and a massive buildup of debt in wealthier countries. They asked
the IMF to study effects of differing speeds of implementing such
policies.
 Strauss-Kahn said Europe's woes were a global problem and it
was important that Asia, through its currencies, help with the
vital global economic rebalancing.
 ""The IMF still believes the renminbi (yuan) is till
substantially undervalued ... (but) even a revaluation of 20-25
percent doesn't solve all the imbalances and you have more to do,
so it's only part of the problem and you still have other
imbalances.""
 It found that if the wealthy countries cut deficits and
increased savings without complementary actions by developing
export-oriented economies to boost domestic demand, short term
growth would suffer in both. The wealthy countries would see more
growth in the longer term as a result of an improved fiscal
footing, but developing countries would see lower growth in both
the short term and long term.
 The paper was one of three presented by the IMF to G20
meetings in Busan. In a final draft of its study of bank taxes to
pay for bailouts, it recommended that financial institutions pay
levies similar to insurance premiums.
 These would be based on risk-weighted liabilities. ""The more
risk you create, the more you should pay,"" the official said.
 The IMF favours collecting the levies before a financial
crisis hits because this would spread costs of banking failures
evenly -- to both survivors and failed institutions.
 The bank tax recommendations, however, may fall on deaf ears,
as there was little agreement at Busan on bank levies, with some
countries steadfastly against them, and differing views on their
methods. The final communique by the ministers made no reference
bank levies.
 ""I won't say it's the end of this idea,"" said Strauss-Kahn,
while conceding countries might end up doing different things.
 The IMF's other briefing paper reaffirmed its global economic
forecasts issued in April, which predicted global economic growth
at 4.2 percent for 2010.
 The IMF official said the financial turbulence emanating from
Europe has ""added to the realism of the downside risks that were
already described in the World Economic Outlook.""

297,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2010 05:07AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-ECB's Trichet says bank stress tests nearly complete," (Adds Geithner on European stress tests)
 By Huw Jones and Sophie Taylor
 BUSAN, South Korea, June 5 (Reuters) - Europe is close to
completing stress tests on its banks to gauge their ability to
withstand a market slump and the results should be published to
help restore market confidence, top European Central Bank
officials said on Saturday.
 Washington has been urging Europe to conduct such tests in
the belief that publishing similar assessments of U.S. banks heed
bolster confidence on Wall Street and prodded banks to raise
needed extra capital.
 The ECB said last week that euro zone banks faced potential
writedowns totalling 195 billion euros by the end of 2011.
 Speaking after a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and
central bank chiefs, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said he
expected the authorities to take stock of the stress test
exercise done according to guidelines from the ECB and the EU's
executive, the European Commission.
 ""I expect appropriate communication will take place at that
moment,"" Trichet told a news conference.
 The tests are being conducted by the Committee of European
Banking Supervisors (CEBS) which is made up of the EU's 27
national bank regulators.
 The results will be passed on to EU finance ministers.
 Details of a previous test were made public only in broad
terms with no reference to individual banks.
 Mario Draghi, the Bank of Italy governor who heads the
Financial Stability Board, said Europe should take a leaf out of
Washington's book and publish the results.
 ""The decision of the U.S. government to undertake these tests
last year and publish them had a very beneficial impact both on
the market and on the banks themselves,"" Draghi told reporters in
Busan.
 ""It clears the air and basically puts the banks in a
condition they would be able to raise capital. I think we should
aim at doing the same,"" said Draghi, who is also a member of the
ECB governing council.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, urged Europe to
make further efforts to restructure and recapitalise its banks.
 In response to a question on whether Europeans should take
additional steps, such as disclosures of stress tests, Geithner
said the basic commitment to transparency in America's bank
stress tests had been critical to recapitalising banks.
 ""Markets work better when people have a better sense of how
to assess risk, markets work better when they're not operating in
the dark,"" Geithner told a news conference in Busan.
 European banks needed to undertake a serious effort to
improve their transparency, Draghi said.
 Italy's banks are properly capitalised and not under threat
from market volatility due to worries over the economic problems
of Hungary and Greece, Draghi added.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The euro slumped below $1.20
for the first time in more than four years on Friday while U.S.
stocks sank over 3 percent on fears Hungary could become the
next casualty in an escalating European debt crisis.
 Disappointing growth in U.S. payrolls in May added to
doubts about the sustainability of the economic recovery,
driving investors to the traditional safe havens of U.S. and
German government bonds.
 The aversion to risk weighed heavily on commodities, with
oil sinking more than 4 percent to below $72 a barrel.
 Hungary, perceived as the weak link in Eastern Europe due
to its high debt ratios, spooked investors again on Friday when
a spokesman for the new prime minister said recent comments
about a Greek-style debt crisis there were not exaggerated.
 Stocks fell across the board to hit their lowest closing
levels. The Dow closed below 10,000 points and the S&P 500 slid
to its lowest level since early February.
 ""The market is reacting to disappointing jobs report and
Europe. The story about Hungary facing budget pressures is just
another in a line of worries coming out of Europe,"" said
Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in
Westport, Connecticut.
 European banks with exposure to Eastern Europe were hit
hard, adding pressure to the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of top shares, which closed lower after four
consecutive sessions of gains.
 The euro  was down 1.52 percent at $1.1972, also
pressured by comments by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon,
who said he only saw ""good news"" in the parity between the
European single currency and the dollar. [ID:nLDE6531E6]
 Fillon's remarks were later clarified by a source, who said
his reference to ""parity"" was about the general evolution of
the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar.
[ID:nWEA4967]
 BANK FEARS
 Stocks extended losses after the European single currency
pierced the psychological level of $1.20.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell
2.8 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> finished down
324.06 points, or 3.16 percent, at 9,931.22, while the Standard

to 1,064.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> slid 83.86
points, or 3.64 percent, to 2,219.17.
 Financial stocks were among the worst performers, with both
the KBW Banks index <.BKX> and S&P Financial sector <.GSPF>
down around 4 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed down 1.86 percent at 998.60 points, led lower by
banking stocks.
 Shares of French bank Societe Generale  fell 7.6
percent concerns about the firm's derivatives operations. A
bank spokesman said there was nothing to be said about the
matter. [ID:nWEA4961]
 Banks with exposure to eastern European countries also
fell, with Raiffeisen International  and Erste Group
Bank  down 8.3 percent and 7.8 percent respectively.
 Most stocks of banks with a significant exposure to Eastern
Europe feature among Europe's biggest losers so far in 2010,
with Societe Generale down about 35 percent and Raiffeisen down
21 percent.
 They have been underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Banks
<.SX7P>, which is down 15.3 percent year-to-date.
 Emerging market stocks were 1.2 percent lower according to
a MSCI index <.MSCIEF>.
 JOBS FRUSTRATION
 Investors were also disappointed by data showing U.S.
nonfarm payrolls rose by 431,000 in May, far below a consensus
estimate for 513,000 new jobs as private sector hiring slowed
sharply.
 Although payrolls last month grew at their fastest pace in
10 years, about 90 percent of the gains came from temporary
hiring for the decennial U.S. Census. Private-sector hiring was
hurt as businesses opted to increase hours rather than take on
new workers.
 ""The market is bothered by the fact that you had a smaller
headline gain in private payrolls, and very little of it was in
the services sector,"" said Cary Leahey, senior managing
director at Decision Economics in New York.
 The services sector is the largest segment of the U.S.
economy.
 Investors rushed into assets considered safer after the
jobs data, pushing 10-year Treasury notes  up 45/32
in price. Yields on the benchmark bond fell to 3.2023 percent
from 3.37 percent on Thursday.
 German Bund futures rallied to a record high in after-hours
trading. The June contract  jumped 113 ticks to
129.63.
 The aversion to risk also drove currency trade, with
investors buying currencies perceived as safe-havens, such as
the yen and Swiss franc.
 ""The euro was already getting hammered on worries about
Hungary and with the nonfarm payrolls not living up to
expectations, the risk trade is under assault from every
angle,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research
at GFT Forex, in New York.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was 0.87 percent lower
at 91.84 yen, after hitting a session low of 91.69 yen
according to Reuters data.
 The yen also rose against the euro and the Australian and
New Zealand dollars.
 Spot gold  rose 0.97 percent to $1,219.30 an ounce,
after touching a session low of $1,196.65 an ounce.
 Assets seen as higher risk fell. Copper fell to near a
five-month low, and U.S. crude oil futures fell 4.15 percent,
to $71.51 per barrel.

 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The euro fell below $1.20 for
the first time in more than four years on Friday on concern
that Europe's debt crisis is expanding and as U.S. stocks slid
more than 3 percent.
 Investors shunned riskier assets and bought currencies
perceived as safe-havens, such as the yen and Swiss franc, as a
government report showed U.S. non-farm payrolls grew at a
slower-than-expected rate in May. The slump in equities added
to the safety bid.
 Analysts said the jobs data reinforced the view the U.S.
economic recovery may be slow.
 Growing concerns that Hungary could be facing a Greek-style
debt crisis weighed on sentiment toward the euro as the
Hungarian forint fell to a one-year low against the euro.
 ""The euro was already getting hammered on worries about
Hungary, and with the non-farm payrolls not living up to

said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT

platform, and in midafternoon trading in New York was 1.6
percent lower at $1.1959.
 U.S. employers created 431,000 jobs in May, the Labor
Department said, below the 513,000 predicted by analysts polled
by Reuters. The jobless rate fell more than expected to 9.7
percent from 9.9 percent in April.
 ""It's mainly disappointing,"" said Vassili Serebriakov,
senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York.
""The pace of the recovery in the jobs sector is not as fast as
some of the optimistic expectations in the market.""
 Against the yen, the dollar was down 1.1 percent at 91.64
yen, after hitting a session low of 91.43 yen, according to
Reuters data. The yen also rose against the euro and the
Australian and New Zealand dollars.
 ""The data is clearly risk negative and the purest currency
trades are short commodity currencies versus the Japanese yen,""
said Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS Global
Banking & Markets, in Stamford, Connecticut. ""But the most
pressing problems are in Europe.""
 For the week, the euro fell 2.5 percent against the dollar,
bringing its two-week decline to 4.6 percent, the biggest since
the two weeks ended Nov. 2, 2008.
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent against the yen this week, with
a cumulative increase of 1.6 percent over the last two weeks at
current prices.
 . 
 FRENCH PM'S REMARKS
 Selling pressure on the euro started prior to the U.S. jobs
report, with the single currency hitting its lowest level
against the dollar in more than four years after comments by
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon on exchange rates.
 Fillon said he was not concerned by the current level of
the euro to the dollar and that he saw only ""good news"" in the
parity between the two currencies. Later the remarks were
clarified saying his reference to ""parity"" was about the
general evolution of the exchange rate between the euro and the
dollar.
 Still, the comments also caused the euro to fall steeply
against the Swiss franc, which traders attributed to an absence
of bids from the Swiss National Bank, which has recently
intervened to keep the franc from appreciating.
 The euro fell 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc and 0.7
percent against sterling.
 A daily close under the 50 percent retracement of the
2000-2008 euro rally at $1.2135 would be seen as a bearish
signal for the euro, technical analysts said.
 Hedge fund adviser Medley Global Advisors issued a report
saying China is buying euro-denominated assets in order to
underpin the currency, which may have contributed to a slight
strengthening in the euro against the dollar earlier.
 The Australian dollar fell 2.6 percent against its U.S.
counterpart while the New Zealand dollar plunged 2.1 percent.
Sterling slipped 1 percent against the dollar to $1.4466.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 02:19PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Hungary rekindles investor fears over emerging Europe," By Sujata Rao and Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Dire warnings by Hungary's new
government have reignited market concern about the fiscal health
of countries in eastern Europe, but many analysts believe the
region's sound economic fundamentals will prevent a Greek-style
debt crisis.
 With investor nerves already frayed over the state of public
finances in the euro zone, remarks by the Hungarian prime
minister's spokesman supporting the view that the country had
only a slim chance of avoiding a debt crisis similar to that of
Greece triggered a regional sell-off on Friday. ""The market
fears another Greece situation ... Fear is taking its toll,""
said Marc Chandler, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 As many economies in eastern Europe had secured billions of
dollars in multilateral aid at the height of the global
financial crisis nearly two years ago, investors had tended to
be more sanguine about fiscal slippages in the region.
But the latest comments from Hungary hasten a discernable
erosion in belief that emerging Europe can withstand the crisis
of investor confidence in the euro zone, sparked by concerns
about debt-laden Greece, Portugal and Spain.
 The Hungarian forint fell to a 12-month low to the euro on
Friday, having lost 4.5 percent this week. Budapest stocks have
fallen 5 percent this week.
 Nor is the weakness confined to Hungary. Polish, Romanian
and Czech stocks have all fallen between 2 and 3 percent this
week while currencies have posted steep losses to the euro. 
 Debt insurance costs for Hungary and Romania are at one-year
highs and bond yields across the region have spiked.
 Eastern European stocks are down 8.5 percent this year,
underperforming broader emerging equities which have fallen 7.7
percent over the same period.
 ""If you're a fund manager sitting in Greenwich, Connecticut,
and you see eastern Europe going down the pan, you get rid of
everything,"" Neal Shearing, economist at Capital Economics said.
 ""(This) will also put the spotlight on other weaker
economies such as Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and I'm also still
not sure we've seen the end of the problem in the Baltics.""
 
 FEARS REKINDLED
 For investors, the sell-off rekindles memories of 2008 when
emerging Europe was at the epicentre of default fears, stepping
back from the brink only with emergency aid from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its multilateral partners.
 Now, investor concerns are resurfacing over rising deficits
in the region.
Romania, also on an IMF programme, this week suffered its
third bond auction failure in a month with investors unconvinced
about Bucharest's ability to implement austerity measures needed
to access the crucial IMF funds.
 Analysts say Poland, which faces an election next year, is
also dragging its feet on trimming its fiscal deficit which is
expected to come in at 7 percent of gross domestic product.
 Hungary's new government has warned that its deficit could
hit 7.5 percent compared with the 3.8 percent target set by the
previous administration under its agreement with the IMF.
 Meanwhile, this week's sharp currency falls could be
perilous for the region's households, many of whom have debt in
foreign currencies.
 About 60 percent of all outstanding loans and mortgages in
Hungary, for instance, are in euros or Swiss francs.
 The country's total external debt is around 140 percent of
gross domestic product.
 Hungary also faces heavy foreign debt refinancing
obligations with about 12 billion euros due in 2010 and 16
billion euros next year.
 Western Europe's battered banking sector could also take a
hit via its $1.3 trillion exposure to the former Communist bloc.
 Banks such as Unicredit and Raiffeisen which are heavily
exposed to emerging Europe, were among the biggest losers as
stock markets fell on Friday.
 
 KNEE-JERK REACTION?
 Some of the fears may be overblown though. Analysts point
out that the region still has the backing of the IMF and while
Hungarian debt levels are high, public or government debt is 80
percent of GDP compared to 120 percent in Greece. 
 Short-term external government debt due within the next year
is just 2.4 percent of GDP, Shearing of Capital Economics
estimates. Budapest is yet to touch any of its IMF cash since
the start of 2010 and its foreign currency reserves have doubled
since October 2008 to 34.2 billion euros.
""There's been an overreaction caused by the political noise
we're getting out of Hungary that is out of sync with the
fundamentals of the economy. The spillover to the region is
overdone,"" said Simon Quijano Evans, strategist at Chevreaux.
While economies in the region rely heavily on western Europe
for exports, their economic fundamentals look much more solid
than euro zone states. Poland was the only European Union
country to avoid recession last year and growth is still
relatively robust with the government forecasting at least 3
percent growth this year.
 ""Although the Hungarian comments dented sentiment for the
region as a whole, we do see some signs of investors
differentiating between countries,"" said Andreas Kolbe, EEMEA
credit strategist at Barclays.
 Hungarian CDS have now surged above Romania's, despite
typically being lower, he said. ""Going forward, I'd expect
increased differentiation on fundamentals when the general
market volatility settles,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar on Friday to the lowest in more than four years on
concern Europe's debt crisis is expanding and a 2 percent drop
in U.S. stocks.
 Investors shunned riskier assets and bought currencies

recovery may be slow. For details, see [ID:nLDE65306M]

platform, and in midafternoon trading in New York was 1.2
percent lower at $1.2010 .
 U.S. employers created 431,000 jobs in May, the Labor
Department said, below the 513,000 increase predicted by
analysts polled by Reuters. The jobless rate fell more than
expected to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent in April.
[ID:nOAT004640]
 ""It's mainly disappointing,"" said Vassili Serebriakov,
senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York.
""The pace of the recovery in the jobs sector is not as fast as
some of the optimistic expectations in the market.""
 The dollar was 1.1 percent lower at 91.58 yen ,

trades are short commodity currencies versus the Japanese yen,""
said Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS Global
Banking & Markets, in Stamford, Connecticut. ""But the most

 FRENCH PM'S REMARKS
 Selling pressure on the single currency started prior to
the U.S. jobs report, with the euro hitting its lowest against
the dollar in more than four years after comments by French
Prime Minister Francois Fillon on exchange rates.
 Fillon said he was not concerned by the current level of
the euro to the dollar and that he saw only ""good news"" in the
parity between the two currencies. Later the remarks were
clarified saying his reference to ""parity"" was about the
general evolution of the exchange rate between the euro and the
dollar. [ID:nWEA4967]
 Still, the comments caused the euro to fall steeply also
against the Swiss franc, which traders attributed to an absence
of bids from the Swiss National Bank, which has recently
intervened to keep the franc from appreciating.
 Traders cited model and macro accounts, as well as central
banks, as selling the single currency.
 A daily close under the 50 percent retracement of the
2000-2008 euro rally at $1.2135 would be seen as a bearish
signal for the euro, technical analysts said.
 But hedge fund advisor Medley Global Advisors issued a
report saying China is buying euro-denominated assets in order
to underpin the currency, which may have contributed to a
slight strengthening in the euro against the dollar earlier.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The euro slumped below $1.20
for the first time in more than four years on Friday and global
stocks slid as investors feared Hungary could become the next
casualty in an escalating European debt crisis.
 Disappointing growth in U.S. payrolls in May added to
doubts about the sustainability of the economic recovery,
driving investors to the perceived safety of U.S. and German
government bonds.
 The aversion to risk weighed heavily on commodities, with
oil sinking more than 3.5 percent to below $72 a barrel.
 Hungary, perceived as the weak link in Eastern Europe due
to its high debt ratios, spooked investors again on Friday when
a spokesman for the prime minister said recent comments about a
Greek-style debt crisis there were not exaggerated.
 European banks with exposure to Eastern Europe were hit
hard, adding pressure to the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of top shares, which closed lower after four
consecutive sessions of gains.
 ""The market is reacting to disappointing jobs report and
Europe. The story about Hungary facing budget pressures is just
another in a line of worries coming out of Europe,"" said
Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in
Westport, Connecticut.
 The euro  was down 1.36 percent at $1.1992, also
pressured by comments by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon,
who said he only saw ""good news"" in the parity between the
European single currency and the dollar. [ID:nLDE6531E6]
 Fillon's remarks were later clarified by a source, who said
his reference to ""parity"" was about the general evolution of

[ID:nWEA4967]
 Stocks added to losses once the European single currency
pierced the psychological level of $1.20. The euro fell as low
as $1.1972, according to EBS trading platform.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell
about 2 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slumped 236.92
points, or 2.31 percent, at 10,018.36, while the Standard &

 Financial stocks were among the worst performers, with both
the KBW Banks index <.BKX> and S&P Financial sector <.GSPF>
down more than 2 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed down 1.86 percent at 998.60 points, led lower by
banking stocks.
 Shares of French bank Societe Generale  fell 7.6
percent concerns about the firm's derivatives operations. A
bank spokesman said there was nothing to be said about the
matter. [ID:nWEA4961]
 Banks with exposure to eastern European countries fell,
with Raiffeisen International  and Erste Group Bank
 down 8.3 percent and 7.8 percent respectively.
 Most stocks of banks with a significant exposure to Eastern
Europe feature among Europe's biggest losers so far in 2010,
with Societe Generale down about 35 percent and Raiffeisen down
21 percent.
 They have been underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Banks
<.SX7P>, which is down 15.3 percent year-to-date.
 Emerging market stocks were 0.9 percent lower according to
a MSCI index <.MSCIEF>.
 Stocks were already under pressure as the U.S. Labor
Department said nonfarm payrolls in May rose by 431,000, far
below a consensus estimate for 513,000 new jobs.
 Although payrolls last month grew at their fastest pace in
10 years, buoyed by temporary hiring for the decennial census,
private hirings slowed sharply as businesses opted to increase
hours rather than take on new workers.
 ""The market is bothered by the fact that you had a smaller
headline gain in private payrolls, and very little of it was in
the services sector,"" said Cary Leahey, senior managing
director at Decision Economics in New York.
 Investors rushed into assets considered safer after the
jobs data, pushing 10-year Treasury notes  up 42/32
in price. Yields on the benchmark bond fell to 3.2132 percent
from 3.37 percent on Thursday.
 The aversion to risk also drove currency trade, with
investors buying currencies perceived as safe-havens, such as
the yen and Swiss franc.

 Assets seen as higher risk fell. Copper fell to near a

to $72.17 per barrel.

 By Joanne Frearson
 LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - European shares snapped their
four-day winning streak to end lower on Friday after U.S. jobs
data disappointed and banks fell, with Societe Generale down on
concerns over its derivatives operations.
 The U.S. Labor Department showed payrolls rose by 431,000 in
May, well below a forecast of 513,000 in a Reuters poll.

 Banks were under pressure and snapped the previous sessions

concerns about its derivatives division, but a spokeswoman at
SocGen said: ""If we had something to say we would have said it.""
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index shares closed down

 ""Today is a day of bad news and there has not been any

 Friday's sharp sell-off represented a market cap wipeout of
about 1.9 billion euros ($2.32 billion) for SocGen.
 
 BP PARES GAINS
 BP pared earlier gains and was up 0.3 percent. The company
said it resisted political pressure to stop dividend payouts on
Friday as oil continued to spill from one of its wells into the
Gulf of Mexico.
 However, other energy stocks fell along with crude down 3.6
percent after the U.S. jobs data tempered optimism over the
strength of the economic recovery.
 BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Cairn Energy were
down 1 to 2.9 percent.
 Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was down 1.6 percent,

 * Timeframe, extent of approvals unclear, opposition likely
 * U.S. corn imports may get boost
 
 By Gus Trompiz
 PARIS, June 4 (Reuters) - The EU's plan to overhaul the
approval system for genetically modified crops is a milestone in
the world's most GM-hostile region that could boost output, but
it's unlikely to prompt a rush to biotech seeds in the bloc.
 Under proposals due to be adopted on July 13, the European
Commission would be given greater freedom to approve new GM
varieties for cultivation in return for letting EU governments
decide whether or not to grow them. (See Reuters Exclusive:)
 Traders and analysts say the impact could be varied given
contrasting attitudes in Europe, with the new policy potentially
boosting GM trade in countries like Spain, a major importer and
also currently the EU's top GM crop grower, but unlikely to
transform a hostile climate in leading grain producer France.
 GM crop authorisations in Europe have been controversial for
years, with public hostility to GM content in food making EU
politicians reluctant to back the technology.
 EU politicians have approved just two GM varieties for
growing in 12 years, compared with more than 150 worldwide,
while commercial GM planting in Europe last year covered less
than 100,000 hectares versus 134 million hectares globally.
 
 BOOST TO OUTPUT, IMPORTS
 If the new rules lead to many approvals, this could boost
European crop output. ""You can clearly see the impact this has
had in the U.S. with higher yields,"" the French trader said.
 But a limited number of new approvals, coupled with
potential vetoes in some countries, could curb GM expansion.
 ""This announcement won't necessarily lead to sharp rises in
GM crop production and it would make it easier for countries who
want to go GM free to do so,"" said Emma Hockridge, head of
policy at the Soil Association in the UK. 
 Imports of GM products, which have been stifled by the
non-approval of varieties, could also accelerate, notably corn
from the United States, analysts said.
 ""Eventually, they could open up Europe for corn imports. It
may be two years away,"" said grains analyst Charlie Sernatinger
of Fortis Clearing Americas in Chicago. ""If they allow GMO crops
to be cultivated, they would allow these crops to be imported.""
 The EU does not import significant volumes of U.S. corn due
to non-approval of GM varieties. 
 In the current 2009/10 marketing year ending Aug. 31, the
European Union has purchased a mere 4,500 tonnes of U.S. corn.
But by comparison, the EU has purchased 2.7 million tonnes of
approved-variety soybeans from the United States.
 Don Roose, grains analyst with U.S. Commodities in West Des
Moines, Iowa, said any change in Europe's stance on GMO crops
could help a rethink in countries opposed to these crops.
 ""If it is accepted there in Europe, does that help push some
of the other countries to move in the same direction?""

 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - A dour U.S. jobs report
coupled with fears over European banks and talk of a
""Greek-style"" debt crisis in Hungary drove down global stocks
and sent the euro to a four-year low on Friday.
 Safe-haven investments such as gold and government debt
rose while oil and other commodities extended losses after the
U.S. Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls in May rose by
431,000, far below a consensus estimate for 513,000 new jobs.

 By David Brunnstrom
 BRUSSELS, June 4 (Reuters) - The European Union told
Pakistan on Friday it could gain increased access to EU markets
in one to three years but ruled out immediately granting
Islamabad new trade concessions.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said after
talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani that
World Trade Organisation rules prevented the bloc from offering
concessions to a single country.
 ""I believe that we can, if we work properly, in a relatively
short period, one to three years ... advance in terms of market
access to the European Union,"" Barroso told a news conference.
 ""We need to have an agreement for any kind of preferential
agreement on trade -- indeed any agreement on trade -- not only
of all (EU) member states but also the European Parliament.""
 Some products from Pakistan enter the EU market duty free or
at a reduced rate but textile products such as bed linen and
towels, which represent more than 65 percent of Pakistan's
exports to the EU, still face a 12 percent tariff.
 The EU has pledged to boost economic ties with Pakistan to
support its struggle against militancy but some member states
such as Italy which have competing textile industries have
opposed reducing tariffs in that area.
 The two sides did agree on a five-year plan to strengthen
political, security, economic and development cooperation.
 But Gilani had said this week he wanted more trade breaks
from the 27-country EU, Pakistan's largest trading partner, and
that he would push for a start of negotiations on a free trade
agreement leading to a complete removal of trade barriers.
 Islamabad has been seeking benefits under the EU's
Generalised System of Preferences Plus status, which would allow
more duty- and quota-free exports to Europe. The EU is a huge
market, with more than 500 million people. 
 EU diplomats said discussions on a possible start of free
trade talks were not ""off the table,"" but Islamabad needed to do
more by creating competition and regulatory authorities.
 More than 20 percent of Pakistan's exports go to the EU and
two-way trade was more than 7 billion euros in 2009.
 Under the agreement to boost political and other ties,
Barroso said that for the 2011-13 period the EU would boost its
development funding to 75 million euros ($91.40 million) per
year from 50 million annually. 
 It will also provide 69 million euros for a trust fund for
the insurgent-troubled northwest of Pakistan.
 Pakistan, which joined the U.S.-led campaign against
Islamist militancy after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the
United States, has been struggling with a homegrown insurgency.
 Last year, EU member states pledged more than 149 million
euros ($183 million) in emergency aid to help 1.4 million people
displaced by fighting in the northwest of the country.

 * Britain urges completion of new rules to end uncertainty
 * Banks likely to welcome delay after fierce lobbying
 * Lagarde says no reason to extend Basel timetable
(Adds French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde)
 By Louise Egan and David Milliken
 BUSAN, South Korea, June 4 (Reuters) - Tough new global bank
capital rules will be phased in over a longer time than
originally planned, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said
on Friday in a sign that intense lobbying by banks is paying off.
 The Group of 20 leading emerging and developed economies
agreed last year to finalise sweeping new bank capital and
liquidity rules this year and to put them into effect by the end
of 2012.
 Banks have mounted a vocal campaign for a longer phase-in,
arguing the new rules will make it hard to continue lending to
support the economy and to build up bigger capital buffers in
volatile markets.
 ""Implementation is a variable. Some would like a shorter
period, some would like a longer period. I think that can be
worked out over time,"" Flaherty told reporters on the sidelines
of a G20 finance ministers' meeting.
 ""There can be a compromise on that,"" Flaherty said.
 The so-called Basel III rules will force banks to hold more
and higher-quality capital so they are less likely to need
government bailouts again when the next crisis hits.
 Basel is seen as the world's core regulatory response to the
financial crisis and a litmus test of G20 resolve to apply
lessons from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.
 The world's top banks will unveil a study in Vienna next week
showing how the new rules will dent economic growth significantly
by forcing them to raise billions of dollars in fresh capital.
 Regulators say the economic impact will be far smaller.
 SCOPE TO TALK
 French Economy Minister, Christine Lagarde, said Basel III is
very technical and quality of work should not be compromised by
speed.
 ""It is something too complicated to be botched. I hope that
we stick to the timetable. There is no reason to extend it,""
Lagarde told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 meeting.
 British finance minister George Osborne said in Busan he
wanted Basel III finalised on time this year.
 ""One of the things I'll be pressing for is that the
agreements that were reached last year on capital leverage and
liquidity are now concluded. We want to end the uncertainty,""
Osborne said in remarks distributed by his staff.
 Britain is concerned that some European countries are
attempting to weaken the rules on the quality of core capital.
 Basel III would scrap so-called hybrid capital, which is a
mixture of debt and equity used by many continental European
banks, in favour of pure equity or retained earnings.
 Britain also sees scope for negotiation over when the rules
come into effect, but not over their essential content.
 Flaherty stressed the need to continue working on the tougher
definition of bank capital so that G20 leaders can see progress
when they hold a summit in Canada later this month.
 ""If we get some more work accomplished here this weekend,
then I would expect the leaders in Toronto would be able to
express with assurance that we're going in the right direction,
that we're on time ... to have the agreement in place by the end
of the year,"" Flaherty said.
 The United States has yet to fully implement the existing
global bank capital accord, known as Basel II, and its Treasury
secretary, Timothy Geithner, said on Wednesday he was open to a
longer phase-in for the new capital rules.
 ""It is perfectly reasonable to use transition periods to make
it easier for countries to adjust to what we believe should be
substantially a more demanding, more ambitious set of constraints
on leverage,"" Geithner said.
 ""That's a responsible policy and I'm perfectly comfortable
negotiating using a reasonable transition period,"" Geithner
added.
 Separately, tougher bank trading book capital rules were due
to take effect next January, but the European Union and United
States announced last month that they were negotiating a later,
coordinated implementation date.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 10:19AM ET</span>","GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Wobbles, but an improving backdrop"," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Financial markets remain in a
jittery mood heading into the new week although riskier assets
such as emerging market stocks are well off their lows and
expectations of future volatility have come back down to earth.
 A new worry about debt default in Hungary and some
moderately disappointing U.S. jobs data on Friday acted as a
brake on what had been a gradual return of composure after a
rough couple of months.
 But the underlying mood among investors is still one of
slowly developing optimism.
 This is in part because despite various ructions in markets,
long-term investors have hung on to their belief that the world
economy is generally in recovery mode.
 Friday's U.S. jobs data were not as positive as analysts had
hoped for but still indicated improvement from past months,
adding to an overall picture of steady, if uninspiring, growth.
 Reuters latest polling on global GDP underlined this.
 They showed economists now expecting 4.1 percent growth this
year, up from a 3.6 percent projection in January, and 3.8
percent next year, down slightly from 4.0 percent.
 Perhaps more significantly, the range of projections for
growth next year both narrowed and rose, suggesting that
optimism is beginning to outweigh pessimism.
 ""We have seen a strong rebound driven by fiscal measures and
a restocking of inventories,"" said Alessandro Bee, an economist
at Bank Sarasin in Zurich.
 He expects a slowdown of the current rate of growth towards
the end of the year and into the early part of next year, but
nothing in the way of a double dip.
 ""We are optimistic that it will be kind of a mid-cycle
slowdown. Monetary conditions are still very supportive,"" Bee
said.
 This relatively positive macroeconomic backdrop has allowed
investors to get over some of their worst fears about European
debt defaults, not withstanding dire circumstances in economies
such as Greece and Hungary.
 Since hitting a year low on May 25, world stocks are up some
6 percent with the more volatile emerging market component
gaining more than 8 percent.
 Some technical specialists, such as Richard Ross of Auerbach
Grayson, even see buy signals emerging.
 ""Wednesday's 95 percent upside volume day on the (New York
Stock Exchange) added to the litany of evidence in support
of our view that the painful May correction has run its course
and a powerful advance has commenced,"" Ross said in a note.
 Significantly, the CBOE volatility index, the so-called fear
gauge of stock market expectations, has fallen back to around 30
from a level near 50 that was implying major trouble ahead for
equities and riskier assets in general.
 Investors, meanwhile, are re-assessing their earlier fears
about a major economic catastrophe springing from debt problems
in the Europe.
 ""We do not expect an economic stalemate like in the
aftermath of the Lehman failure,"" Klaus Wiener, head of research
at Generali Investments in Cologne, said in a note.
 ""The growth impact is without doubt negative, but there are
offsetting factors as well: a weaker euro, strong reactions of
the monetary policy, and the fact that sovereign credit risk is
not an issue in Asia (ex Japan).""
 
 BACK TO BASICS
 This is not to say that all is back to normal. Far from it.
Investors still have a large number of questions even beyond the
ones surrounding the euro zone.
 ""Will the U.S. deal with its fiscal burden? What is the
inflation outlook for the major economies? How far will the
regulatory pendulum swing?"" said Andrew Milligan, head of
strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh.
 ""On balance, investors are still pretty nervous.""
 Reaction on Friday to gloomy prognostications from Hungarian
officials underlined the fragility of market sentiment. 
 The focus is what will happen to leading banks if Hungary
defaults or if the fall in the forint fuels a rise in loan
delinquency among Hungarians who have borrowed heavily in euros
and Swiss francs.
 The coming week will offer a range of events to keep
investors on their toes, including speeches on Wednesday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in Richmond, Virginia and
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet in
Frankfurt.
 On Thursday, Trichet will hold a news conference after the
ECB makes its latest policy decision. The Bank of England and
ECB hold rate meetings, with both expected to stay on hold.
 The Fed also releases its Beige Book on Wednesday, offering
anecdotal hints about current economic conditions in the world's
largest economy from the Fed's various districts.
 Euro zone and other European Union finance ministers,
meanwhile, meet at the beginning of the week where it is almost
inevitable that they will discuss Hungary, Greece and possibly
even the tumbling euro.
 The single currency has fallen some 16 percent against the
dolalr so far this year and is currently trading around $1.20, a
four-year low.
 Brown Brothers Harriman suggested on Friday that the fall
was welcome news to the euro zone because of its implications
for exports. It said there was ""malign neglect"" in the euro's
fall as opposed to the oft-cited ""benign neglect"" said to be
practiced by the United States.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 10:15AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-Merkel's tough choices to tackle German deficit," BERLIN, June 4 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
meets cabinet ministers on Sunday and Monday to take tough
decisions on spending cuts and/or tax rises next year to
consolidate the budget deficit in Europe's biggest economy.
 Although Germany's public deficit is likely to be
significantly lower than levels in some other euro zone states
this year, it is still expected to exceed 5 percent of gross
domestic product, breaching the EU's three percent cap.
 The government also has for the first time to take into
account a new ""debt brake"" rule which requires the government to
reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio and cut the structural deficit by
roughly 10 billion euros, experts say.
 However, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said the
government faces less of a challenge than previously anticipated
to consolidate its finances this year and in the mid-term.
 The ministry expects federal net new borrowing to total some
70 billion euros this year, roughly 10 billion below its
previous forecast, officials in the ruling coalition say.
 Here are some of the options which ministers will haggle
over at the weekend:
 
 SALES TAX RISE
 * Some experts have suggested raising sales tax to 25
percent from 19 percent, saying that could generate more than 50
billion euros.
 Another option is to increase sales tax to the full rate of
19 percent on some items that benefit from a lower rate of 7
percent.
 Likelihood: A blanket rise seems highly unlikely, not least
because it would be politically difficult on top of a 3
percentage point increase in 2007. That was the biggest tax rise
in post-war Germany. In addition, the move could fuel criticism
from other euro zone states that Germany should do more to boost
domestic demand.
 
 OTHER TAX RISES
 * The government is considering raising tax on tobacco, say
sources, which would generate several hundred million euros.
 * The government may also extend a highway toll for trucks
which would bring in hundreds of millions of euros. 
 * The environment ministry has said it is considering a new
tax on the burning of nuclear fuel rods which would be linked to
companies benefiting from a planned extension of the lives of
some nuclear plants. It is unclear how much this could raise.
 * Media have speculated about talk of a possible special tax
on flights.
 Likelihood: At least some of these measures look likely
 
 OTHER REVENUE-BOOSTING MEASURES
 * The government may park the proceeds from its sale of UMTS
telecoms licences into the 2011 budget. That could boost
revenues by some 4 billion euros.
 Likelihood: This one-off trick seems a likely option.
 
 SPENDING CUTS/BENEFIT CURBS
 * Ministers will be urged to swallow spending cuts and
budget discipline in 2011 but a few areas are sacred. 
 Media have reported that Merkel does not want to make major
cuts in pensions or unemployment benefits. 
 However, cuts in parental benefits for the long-term
unemployed are possible. This could result in savings of about
400 million euros.
 Merkel, who has a long-term policy of lifting spending on
education to 10 percent of GDP, is also loathe to make major
cuts to the education budget.
 Transport is an obvious target for cuts but Transport
Minister Peter Ramsauer has put up stiff resistance so far.
 Likelihood: Big cuts to pensions, unemployment benefit and
education look unlikely but smaller adjustments are expected.
 
 DEFENCE 
 * Germany's armed forces could be reduced in size by up to
40 percent, German media have reported. One newspaper has said
the size of Germany's Bundeswehr army could be cut to 150,000,
around 100,000 less than the present total. That would yield
savings of about 400 million euros a year. Another paper said
the reduction could be around 50,000.
 Abolishing Germany's compulsory military service is also
under discussion but Merkel seems to have ruled out that option,
partly because the resulting savings would not make such a
controversial move worthwhile.
 Likelihood: Army cuts are likely, military service to stay.

 (Adds details, comments. Changes byline)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell versus the yen on Friday
but rose against the euro after a government report showed U.S. non-farm
payrolls grew at a slower than expected rate in May.
 Analysts said the data disappointed investors looking for a stronger figure
and reinforced the view that the recovery in the U.S. economy and labor market
was a gradual one.
 ""It's mainly disappointing,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency
strategist at Wells Fargo Bank in New York. ""The pace of the recovery in the
jobs sector is not as fast as some of the optimistic expectations in the
market.""
 U.S. employers created 431,000 jobs in May, the U.S. Labor Department said,
below the 513,000 increase predicted by analysts polled by Reuters. The jobless
rate fell more than expected to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent in April. For
more, see [ID:nOAT004640]
 In morning trading in New York, the dollar was 0.7 percent lower at 92.06
yen , after hitting a session low of 91.91 according to Reuters data.
 ""We've seen the dollar fall versus the yen. The euro has also extended its
losses and that's mainly a risk aversion thing. The market has a very cautious
tone right now,"" said Serebriakov.
 The euro extended losses and was last trading down about 1 percent at
$1.2052 . It traded as low as $1.2019, according to Reuters data.
 Selling pressure on the single currency started prior to the U.S. jobs
report, with the euro hitting its lowest against the dollar in more than four
years after comments by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon on exchange
rates.
 Fillon said he was not concerned by the current level of the euro to the
dollar and that he saw only ""good news"" in the parity between the two
currencies. Later the remarks were clarified saying his reference to ""parity""
was about the general evolution of the exchange rate between the euro and the
dollar. [ID:nWEA4967]
 Still, the comments caused the euro to fall steeply also against the Swiss
franc, which traders attributed to an absence of bids from the Swiss National
Bank, which has recently intervened to keep the franc from appreciating.
 Traders cited model and macro accounts, as well as central banks, as
selling the single currency.
 ""The euro was already getting hammered... and with the nonfarm payrolls not
living up to expectations, the risk trade is under assault from every angle,""
said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT Forex, in New
York.
 ""This could push the euro below $1.20, as the market had been so primed for
a stronger jobs number.""
 There are so many stops from here to $1.20 that the temptation to run them
is going to be overwhelming,"" he said.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 09:36AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-French PM says not concerned by euro decline," (Adds background detail)
 PARIS, June 4 (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Francois
Fillon said on Friday he was not concerned by the decline of the
euro against the dollar, saying the previous higher exchange
rate had damaged French exporters.
 ""I have not changed my position for years. With the
President, we were complaining about the fact that the level
between the euro and dollar did not correspond to the reality of
the economies and was strongly handicapping our exports,"" he
told reporters at a news conference.
 ""Therefore, I have no worries regarding the current rate.""
 Fillon's comments sent the euro  to its lowest level
against the dollar in more than four years, although it
subsequently recovered a little.
 His comments reflect a longstanding position among French
leaders including President Nicolas Sarkozy that the strength of
the euro in past years was damaging the country's export sector.
 Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said this week that
exporters appeared satisfied with the weaker euro, while
European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer
said that the euro was close to its long-term average.
 The single currency has fallen from some $1.44 at the start
of the year to just above $1.20 on Friday afternoon amid
mounting worries about the stability of public finances in the
16-member monetary zone.
 The largest share of France's exports goes to its partners
in the euro zone but one of its industrial flagships is Airbus
parent company EADS , which competes primarily with U.S.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - A dour U.S. jobs report
added to fresh fears on Friday over European banks and talk of
a ""Greek-style"" debt crisis in Hungary, pushing global stocks
lower and the euro to a new four-year trough to the dollar.
 Safe-haven investments like gold and government debt rose
while commodities and European shares extended losses after the
U.S. Labor Department said non-farm payrolls in May rose by
431,000, far less than a consensus estimate of 513,000.
 While payrolls last month grew at their fastest pace in 10
years, buoyed by temporary hiring for the decennial census,
private hirings slowed sharply as businesses opted to increase
hours rather than sign on new workers.
 German bund futures  hit a new session high, rising
to as high as 129.48 compared with 128.99 before the jobs data.
The yield on the two-year Schatz fell to 0.468 percent from
0.488 percent. For details see: [ID:nLDE65317C]
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  traded up
28/32 in price at 101-30/33, compared with being 10/32 higher
shortly before the employment data.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell
0.8 percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares was down 1.5 percent at 1,001.31 points, led by banking
stocks.
 ""The initial take is this is a pretty bad number; well
below expectations,"" T.J. Marta, founder and market strategist
with Marta on the Markets in Scotch Plains, New Jersey:
 ""The key disappointment was in the private payrolls. While
we did get the census hiring, the private economy is not hiring
the way we would have liked.""
 Spot gold  turned higher, reaching $1,208.75 an
ounce, after the payrolls data missed expectations.
 Assets seen as higher risk fell. Copper fell to near a
5-month low and U.S. crude oil futures fell almost $2 to below
$73 a barrel.
 U.S. stock index futures also extended losses. S&P 500
futures  fell 26.4 points and were below fair value, a
formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest
rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.
 Dow Jones industrial average futures  slumped 191
points, and Nasdaq 100 futures  lost 45 points.
 The dollar fell versus the Japanese yen, while the euro
extended losses, down more than 1 percent at a session low of
$1.2019 , according to Reuters data.
 The euro hit a record low versus Swiss franc.
 European stocks were hurt by concern over the derivatives
division of French Societe Generale.
 Societe Generale, which declined to comment on speculation
about losses in its derivatives division, fell 6.3 percent.
 Investors earlier had been spooked again by comments out of
Hungary, perceived as the weak link in eastern Europe due to
high debt ratios.
 A spokesman for the prime minister said a leader of the
newly elected ruling party had not exaggerated when he had said
on Thursday Hungary may face a Greek-style debt crisis.
 That pushed the forint currency to a one-year low and hit
shares in European banks exposed to eastern Europe.
 ""There is fear coming back into the market,"" said Matthew
Brown, sales trader at ETX Capital in London. ""There are
unsubstantiated rumors of a French bank having derivative

said on Friday it would present an economic action plan within
days to reform the economy and address what it says is a much
higher budget deficit than that reported by the last cabinet.
 Comments by ruling party officials that the country had a
slim chance of avoiding a Greek-style crisis have sent the
forint sharply lower and bond yields -- or Hungary's cost of
borrowing -- soaring.

 DEFICIT AND DEBT
 Analysts say revealing a higher deficit figure may just be a
bargaining tactic for talks with the IMF. They project a deficit
of around 5 percent  for this year. 
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy has said the cabinet would
seek to agree on a deficit of 5-6 percent with the EU and IMF.
 The deficit was 4 percent of GDP last year, public debt
about 80 percent, and public and private external debt around
130 percent of GDP. Hungary ran a current account surplus in
2009 and the economy is expected to grow by 0.9 percent this
year according to the central bank.
 For comparison, Greece's deficit target this year is 8.1
percent, down from 13.6 in 2009. Debt is expected at 133.3
percent of GDP and the current account deficit was 14.1 pct of
GDP last year. It expects GDP to fall 4 percent in 2010.

 ANALYSTS' VIEWS
 GYORGY BARCZA AT K&H BANK, BUDAPEST
 ""The same thing is happening as in every election year, they
push up the deficit by one-off items, and then take on a deficit
reduction. This time there could also be tax cuts and structural
reforms, which is better than before.""
 
 GYORGY BARTA AT CIB BANK, BUDAPEST
 ""The government is well advised not to underestimate the
importance of the deficit target, as it is one of the single
most important guideposts for the market. In the current uneasy
global environment, market players do not simply frown on fiscal
loosening but actually bite. It is a logical sequence to first
help sustain a balanced fiscal consolidation path and only carry
out major tax easing afterwards.""
 
 LARS CHRISTENSEN, SENIOR ANALYST AT DANSKE BANK
 ""Hungary was significantly more like Greece in 2006 than
today. (It) has turned a massive current account deficit into a
current account surplus. Second the forint is not overvalued and
Hungary therefore doesn't have the same competitiveness
problems. Third, budget finances - even in the negative scenario
- are in a better shape. That said, there is no room for
mistakes and certainly no room for looser fiscal policy and bad
communication.""

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Friday to a its
lowest against the dollar in more than four years after comments
by the French Prime Minister on exchange rates.
 Investors awaited U.S. non-farm payrolls data at 1230 GMT,
which analysts expect to show strong jobs growth. 
 French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said he was not
concerned by the current level of the euro to the dollar.
 The comments caused the euro to extend falls that followed a
steep drop against the Swiss franc, which traders attributed to
an absence of bids from the Swiss National Bank, which has
recently intervened to keep the franc from appreciating.
 ""The SNB was expected to be on the bid at 1.4000 but
wasn't,"" a trader in London said. 
 Analysts said strong U.S. jobs data could give the dollar a
further boost as the market focuses on the relative
outperformance of the U.S. economy. 
 ""Going into the jobs report, all the indications are that it
will be a strong number and we could see a strong dollar
reaction to it,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman, currency strategist
at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 The euro  fell to a more than four-year low against
the dollar of $1.2034. At 1218 GMT, it was down 1 percent at
$1.2040.
 The single currency hit a record low against the Swiss franc
 of 1.3865 francs, according to electronic trading
platform EBS.
 Traders said there were stops all the way down to the
psychologically important $1.2000 support level.
 Below $1.2000, traders say there is little support for the
euro before its November 2005 low of $1.1638. The euro's launch
level in 1999 at $1.1747 was also a potential key marker.
 Traders said concerns about public finances in Hungary also
weighed on sentiment towards the single currency as the
Hungarian forint fell to a one-year low versus the euro.
 [ID:nLDE6530ZT]
 They also cited large option structures expiring on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday around the $1.2200 level,
as well as a huge double-no-touch structure with a $1.21-$1.25
range set to expire later in the day.
 A daily close under the 50 percent retracement of the
2000-2008 euro rally at $1.2135 would be seen as a bearish
signal for the euro, technical analysts said.
 
 JOBS DATA

 * New rules expected in place by mid-July, but face hurdles

(Adds details from draft proposals, French agriculture
ministry comment, reactions)
 By Charlie Dunmore and Julien Toyer
 BRUSSELS, June 4 (Reuters) - The European Union is to
radically overhaul its approval system for genetically modified
(GM) crops from next month, opening the way to large-scale GM
cultivation in Europe, draft proposals seen by Reuters on Friday
showed.
 With most Europeans showing no appetite for GM produce in
food, EU politicians have approved just two varieties for
growing in 12 years, compared with more than 150 worldwide.
 Under proposals due to be adopted on July 13, the EU
executive Commission will be given greater freedom to approve
new GM varieties for cultivation in return for letting EU
governments decide whether or not to grow them.
 ""It is expected that the authorisation process of GMO
cultivation at EU level will become more efficient"", a
Commission analysis accompanying the proposals said.
 The French Agriculture Ministry said it could not comment on
the plans until it had studied them.
 EU governments may give initial reactions to the proposals
at a meeting of environment ministers in Luxembourg next Friday,
where France has called for a debate on the bloc's GMO policy.
 Commercial GM planting in Europe last year covered less than
100,000 hectares, mostly in Spain, compared with 134 million
hectares globally.
 The plan is likely to see an increase in commercial planting
in countries already using GM technology, such as Spain,
Portugal and the Czech Republic, while legally endorsing
existing GM bans in countries including Italy, Austria and
Hungary.
 But critics said the proposals could spark internal market
disputes within Europe, and leave the EU open to legal
challenges in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which backed a
U.S. complaint in 2006 that the EU's GM policy was unscientific.
 The new rules were drawn up by Maltese Health and Consumer
Affairs Commissioner John Dalli, who caused controversy in March
by approving cultivation of a GM potato used in starch
production.
 The plans are based on a joint Austrian Dutch proposal,
which European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso pledged
to implement last year as part of his bid for reappointment.
 
 TWIN-TRACK APPROACH
 The Commission proposal has two main elements, the drafts
showed.
 The first is an interim measure designed to quickly
introduce the changes, which will see the Commission issue new
guidelines to member states on the ""coexistence"" of GM and
non-GM cultivation.
 These would allow countries to set their own technical
standards for GM farming, for example requiring buffer zones of
10 km (6.2 miles) between GM and non-GM fields, which would in
effect rule out GM cultivation in entire regions and countries.
 The second is a ""restricted amendment"" to current EU
legislation on the release of GM organisms in the environment,
that would allow countries to ban GM cultivation altogether for
reasons other than safety or coexistence grounds.
 The legislative change would have to be agreed by a
qualified majority of EU governments and the European Parliament
under the EU's system of weighted voting.
If the debate cannot be limited to this one change alone as
the Commission hopes, it could mean two or more years of complex
political argument before a decision is reached.
When contacted by Reuters, a spokesman for Dalli refused to
confirm the details of the plan, but said the commissioner had
previously given his backing to the idea and promised to table
proposals before the summer.
 
 OPPONENTS SHARE CONCERNS
 ""These proposals are legally questionable, contrary to the
single market and will sow deep division between the member
states,"" said an industry source who had seen the proposals but
asked not to be named.
 The move could open new European markets for biotech
companies such as Monsanto, Dow Agrosciences, a subsidiary of
Dow Chemical Co., and Syngenta.
 Syngenta's shares initially rose after the news, but closed
down on the day.
 Monsanto spokeswoman Kelli Powers said without more details
the company was not in a position to comment. Officials at Dow
AgroSciences also said they were reserving comment until more
details of the proposal emerge.
 The plan would be a boost to biotech seed companies, said
Jeffries and Co. analyst Laurence Alexander, but broad public
acceptance that would open up the EU to more imports is a more
pressing concern, he added.
 The EU currently blocks all imports containing the tiniest
trace of unapproved GM material, but the Commission is set to
propose a tolerance margin later this year to avoid a repeat of
feed supply disruptions caused by this rule in 2009.
 Environmental campaigners who were briefed on the proposal
by the Commission on Thursday said it confirmed Barroso's
intention to promote GM cultivation in Europe.
 ""The public and environment will only be protected if the
Commission's proposal is backed up by Europe-wide measures to
prevent our food and feed from being contaminated. Until then we
need an immediate ban on growing GM crops,"" said Adrian Bebb,
food and agriculture campaigner with Friends of the Earth.

322,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 07:35AM ET</span>",Q+A - What happens if EU relaxes GMO rules?," By Charlie Dunmore
 June 4 (Reuters) - The EU executive European Commission has
drawn up plans for a radical overhaul of the 27-nation bloc's
rules on genetically modified (GM) crop cultivation, according
to sources, which if approved could see huge growth in plantings
in Europe. Click for Reuters exclusive
 Below are questions and answers the plans raises.
 
 WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED? 
 * The plan set to be adopted in mid-July has two elements:
""fast-track"" technical guidelines immediately enabling member
states to grow or ban GM crops as they choose, and a legislative
change designed to confirm the new approach in EU law.
 * The Commission hopes that by giving countries opposed to
GM cultivation the option to ban it, they will end their
opposition to approving new varieties for growing in the EU and
unblock the paralysis in Europe's approval system.
 * Approvals would still be granted at EU level following a
scientific safety assessment, but member states would be free to
ban cultivation at any time without the need for scientific
justification, and the Commission will not intervene.
 
 WHAT IMPACT WILL THE PLANS HAVE?
 * If approved the proposals are likely to see rapid growth
of GM cultivation in parts of Europe, particularly in countries
seen as favourable to the technology such as Spain, the
Netherlands, Sweden and the Czech Republic.
 * They would also legally confirm cultivation bans in
anti-GM countries such as Italy, Austria and Hungary, and raise
the prospect of new national bans in the future should
governments change their position on GM crops.
 * Multinational biotech companies such as U.S. seed and
chemical giant Monsanto and Swiss agro-chemicals firm Syngenta
could see lucrative new markets opening up in Europe, but
countries' ability to ban cultivation at any time creates legal
uncertainty and could hamper their business plans.
 * Industry experts said new GM crops most likely to be
planted in Europe in the coming years include a maize variety
resistant to the corn root worm, and a fungal-resistant potato
currently being trialled.
 * New GM oilseed rape varieties could be available within a
decade, and GM wheat with resistance to septoria disease could
be developed within 10 to 20 years, they added.
 
 WILL THE PLANS BE APPROVED?
 * The ""fast-track"" guidelines would only need to be
rubber-stamped by EU governments to take effect, which could
happen within weeks of publication in mid-July, though countries
such as France are thought to be strongly opposed to the plans.
 * The legislative change is even more uncertain, as it must
be approved by a qualified majority of EU governments and
members of the European Parliament under the bloc's weighted
voting system.
 * The Commission believes it can restrict the scope of the
legal review to its proposal alone, but EU lawmakers could try
and open up the EU's entire GM policy for review, which could
take several years and make the final outcome very uncertain.

 HOW HAVE THE PLANS BEEN RECEIVED?
 * The biotech industry has criticised the proposals for
introducing unscientific concepts and legal uncertainty into the
EU's approval system, and warn that different rules in different
countries will disrupt the EU's internal market and lead to
legal disputes.
 * Environmentalists are also unhappy, because they fear an
end to the EU's largely GM-free stance, which has seen
commercial planting limited to less than 100,000 hectares to
date, compared with 134 million hectares worldwide.
 * The EU's trading partners are known to be watching
developments closely, and could challenge the new rules in the
World Trade Organisation if they percieve them as anti-science
or a barrier to trade.

 * Unions plan one-day general strike
 *Investors shun debt, fear govt may fail to cut costs
 * Cost cuts needed to secure IMF-led financial aid
 By Sam Cage and Marius Zaharia
 BUCHAREST, June 4 (Reuters) - Romania's government faces a
major test next week, seeking to secure international aid for
its sputtering economy by forcing austerity measures through
parliament in the face of a planned general strike.
 A failed bond auction on Thursday highlighted investor
concern over promised spending cuts, needed to secure the next
tranche of a 20 billion euro ($24.37 billion) International
Monetary Fund-led aid deal.
 The centrist coalition government faces a confidence vote in
parliament over the measures, which could force it to step down.
 ""You have the risk the government will fall, you have social
instability with a one-day general strike planned next week,
those don't look good in the eyes of investors,"" said Nicolaie
Alexandru-Chidesciuc, chief economist at ING Bank in Bucharest.
 Prime Minister Emil Boc's Democratic Liberal Party relies on
the support of an ethnic Hungarian party and independents to
command a majority in parliament and analysts say it would
probably retain enough votes to survive since parliamentarians
fear the consequences of the government falling.
 Romania needs the trust of financial markets -- which fear
the government may fail to cut an oversized state apparatus and
slash wages as social pressure mounts -- to finance its deficit,
which is more than twice the EU's three percent of GDP limit.
 The finance ministry has now rejected all bids in a bond
tender for the third time in the last month, indicating
investors are moving towards shorter-term securities due to both
domestic and international uncertainties.
 ""Given the recent developments, we expect the increased
level of risk aversion towards investing in longer-term
securities to persist and translate into high demanded yields,""
UniCredit analysts said in a note.
 Romania's economy shrank more than 7 percent last year and
the European Union's second-poorest member is still mired in
recession.
 Bucharest has agreed a wider budget deficit target of 6.8
percent of gross domestic product for this year with the IMF but
also has to slash spending and has promised to cut state
employees' wages by 25 percent and pensions by 15 percent.
 The vast and highly unionised public sector accounts for a
third of all jobs and the state payroll swallows 9 percent of
gross domestic product, a figure experts say is twice as high as
it should be.
 Analysts say the five-month-old centrist government will
struggle to force some of the measures through due to growing
social unrest and probable legal challenges. Trade unions hope a
million Romanians will support next week's strike, which will
coincide with whichever day the confidence vote is on.
 
 PRICIER DEBT
 Romania sold less debt than planned in May, rejecting bids
at bond tenders for the first time this year as uncertainty over
the government's fiscal policies and ability to rein in public
spending put upward pressure on yields.
 Yields at Thursday's failed tender for three-year treasury
bonds were probably at about 7.3 percent, said ING's
Alexandru-Chidesciuc, versus an average accepted yield of 6.80
percent at an April 1 auction.
 ""They can't afford reject bids for too long, I was expecting
they would accept some even from yesterday,"" he said.
 ""They probably count on the fact they will get the tranche""
worth some 2 billion euros, he added, referring to the next
installment of the IMF-led aid package.
 ""But even if they do, social turbulence will keep investors
on their toes and this will reflect in yields being
significantly higher than central bank's key rate (of 6.25
percent),"" he said.
The finance ministry has increased domestic debt issuance
plans for June to 4.6 billion lei from the 2.5 billion lei worth
of local currency bills and bonds it sold in May.
 Daniel Hewitt of Barclays Capital said the problems selling
debt are reminiscent of last year when the collapse of Romania's
government led to the IMF aid programme's temporary suspension,
though he still believes parliament will pass the spending cuts.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 06:19AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-UK's Osborne urges G20 bank capital deal," By David Milliken
 BUSAN, South Korea, June 4 (Reuters) - The world's leading
countries should end uncertainty over introducing tough new
bank capital rules that were agreed in principle a year ago,
British finance minister George Osborne said on Friday.
 ""One of the things I'll be pressing for is that the
agreements that were reached last year on capital leverage and
liquidity are now concluded. We want to end the uncertainty,""
Osborne said in remarks distributed by his staff.
 Osborne is meeting other finance ministers from the G20
group of developed and emerging economies in the South Korean
port city of Busan to broker a deal on bank regulation and
policies to boost economic growth.
 G20 leaders agreed last September that banks must hold far
more capital and liquidity by the end of 2012 so they are less
likely to need more taxpayer handouts in the next crisis.
 Banks are lobbying hard to have the new rules phased in
over a longer period and tough new capital rules on bank
trading books due in January already appear set to be delayed.
 Britain is concerned that some European countries are
attempting to weaken tough new rules about the capital banks
are required to hold as a buffer against losses by allowing
hybrid mixes of debt and equity to count towards required
levels.
 Britain sees scope for negotiation over when the rules come
into effect but not over their essential content, though many
details have yet to be finalised.
 Global agreement on this is seen as more urgent for Britain
than a deal on bank taxes -- which is also proving difficult --
as capital rules posed a greater risk of banks locating
business to areas where rules are looser, a G20 source said.
 Nonetheless, Osborne said boosting global growth was the
top priority for the G20 meeting in Busan.
 ""Countries with high budget deficits must show that they
can deal with them. Equally surplus countries such as china
must show that they too can support economic growth going
forward,"" he said.

 TOKYO, June 4 (Reuters) - Mexico could see its automobile
production double to around 3 million vehicles in the next three
to five years as global carmakers such as Volkswagen expand
capacity, its economy minister said on Friday.
 With the world's largest network of free trade agreements,
low manufacturing costs and a relatively stable currency, Mexico
is already the 10th-biggest automobile producer, and exports
account for about 80 percent.
 ""There are new investments coming,"" Economy Minister Gerardo
Ruiz Mateos told Reuters in an interview in Tokyo, pointing to
recent announcements from Fiat SpA, Volkswagen, Nissan Motor Co,
Ford Motor Co, among others, about building new models in the
country.
 ""We think we can reach (around) 3 million cars a year in the
next three to five years. We are hoping that many of the other
players will start building cars in Mexico,"" he said.
 Mexican auto production sank to 1.6 million vehicles in
crisis-hit 2009, but topped 2 million units in each of the
preceding three years as automakers took advantage of Mexico's
proximity to both the United States, the world's second-biggest
auto market, and the fast-growing Latin American market.
 Mexico is recovering from a deep recession thanks to renewed
demand for the cars, televisions and refrigerators it exports to
the United States.
 Ruiz Mateos said the main task for Mexico to attract more
investment was fostering domestic demand, which he said was
unnaturally low -- at 1 million vehicles in a typical year -- for
a country with a population of 100 million.
 ""Brazil has a bigger internal market than Mexico, so many
companies are going to Brazil to attack the local market plus
other small countries in Latin America,"" said Ruiz Mateos, who
worked in the auto parts industry for two decades before joining
the government in 2006.
 ""One of the things that we are working with the automotive
sector in Mexico is to see how we can grow the domestic volume,""
he said, adding that providing better financing for consumers
should help to possibly double Mexico's domestic car sales.
 Ruiz Mateos is in Japan to attend a meeting of APEC trade
ministers this weekend.

 * Equities may find support from US jobs number

(Updates prices, adds quote)
 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Fresh fears over European banks
and talk of a ""Greek-style"" debt crisis in Hungary pushed stock
markets into the red on Friday while the euro hit a new
four-year low to the dollar and a record low versus Swiss franc.
 Markets had earlier been cautiously higher on expectation
that U.S. jobs data would show recovery is gathering pace in the
world's largest economy. 
 Analysts expect the data, due at 1230 GMT, to show the
highest U.S. jobs growth last month since 1983 at 513,000. , the
fifth straight month of gains. Some expect an ever bigger
number.
But by 1200 GMT MSCI world stocks fell 0.6 percent. European
stocks were down 0.6 percent. led by the heavyweight banking
sector which was hurt by concern over the derivatives division
of French Societe Generale.
 Societe Generale, which declined to comment on market
rumours about losses in its derivatives division, fell 6.3
percent. BBVA and Credit Agricole fell 5 and 3.8 percent
respectively.
Before the falls started, global equity markets and U.S.
Treasury yields had in the past week recovered nearly a quarter
of the losses incurred over the previous two months when the
European sovereign debt crisis triggered a scramble out of risk.
 Investors were also spooked again by comments out of
Hungary, perceived as the weak link in eastern Europe due to
high debt ratios. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said a
leader of the newly-elected ruling party had not exaggerated
when he had said on Thursday Hungary may face a Greek-style debt
crisis.
 That pushed the forint currency to a one-year low and hit
shares in European banks exposed to eastern Europe.
 ""There is fear coming back into the market,"" said Matthew
Brown, sales trader at ETX Capital in London. ""There are
unsubstantiated rumours of a French bank having derivative
losses and there are also comments coming out of Hungary.""
 U.S. futures also reversed their early stronger opening. 
 S&P 500 futures fell 8.6 points. Dow Jones industrial
average futures sank 60 points and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped
15.5 points. 
 The optimism over the U.S. jobs is also tempered by the fact
that two-thirds of the new jobs are likely to be temporary hires
for the U.S. government census. 
 And worries over euro zone growth and banks are likely to
continue acting as a check on gains.
 ""If the payrolls figure is good, it'll support stocks on
both sides of the Atlantic. But this could be short-lived in
Europe, where stimulus plans have not been enough to kick-start
growth,"" said Christian Jimenez, fund manager and president of
Diamant Bleu Gestion, in Paris.

 DOLLAR REMAINS IN FAVOUR
 The euro plumbed a fresh four-year low against the dollar
after the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said he was not
concerned by the euro's decline. 
 The euro fell around half a U.S. cent to $1.2048 according
to Reuters data, its lowest level since April 2006. The
euro has lost 17 percent from early 2010 highs.
 Against the Swiss franc the euro dropped to a lifetime low
as the Swiss central bank failed to step in to stem its
currency's strength.
 The euro fell as low as 1.3865 francs according to
electronic trading platform EBS, its weakest since the single
currency's launch in 1999. 
 Fears about tougher funding conditions in Europe and the
impact of spartan fiscal policy on growth may keep a lid on the
nascent revival in risk taking and keep investors favouring the
greenback and U.S. Treasuries.
 ""The dollar continues to attract safe-haven buying on the
back of continued concern in the euro zone about sovereign debt
and credit market liquidity,"" said Michael Hewson, analyst at
CMC markets.

place because of the guidelines, the EU executive is confident
it can win majority support, an EU source said.

development projects will help cushion any slowdown in export
demand arising from the euro zone debt crisis, the World Bank's
chief economist said on Friday.
 Justin Lin also told Reuters in an interview that individual
countries have the right to adopt policy measures aimed at
slowing capital moving in and out of their countries to soften
the impact of a sudden shift in flows.
 ""China is a medium-income country and so there's scope for
infrastructure investment and green economy (projects),"" he said
on the sidelines of a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers
and central bank chiefs in the South Korean city of Busan.
 He said it was unlikely there would be a global regime under
which individual countries could impose capital controls but
imposing some regulations would be acceptable.
 ""Short-term capital inflows and outflows can cause
troubles...So I think many countries need to have policies to
deal with (them),"" he said.
 The head of South Korea's central bank separately told
Reuters on Friday the country wants to reduce volatility of its
own currency, without elaborating.
 The South Korean government is considering whether to impose
some form of controls on short-term foreign borrowing by banks to
prevent a sudden rush of money out of the country.
 Lin said the euro zone's debt crisis and resulting turbulence
in financial markets could play the role of delaying exit
strategies.
 ""With the changes in the domestic situation or the external
situations, certainly a good policy needs to adapt. In that
regard, I will not be surprised to see some kind of adjustment to
the changing situations,"" he said.

 * Growing number of Chinese exporters turn down euro
payment
 * Local governments warn exporters to steer clear of euro
 * Euro billing had been part of China's diversification
push
 By Zhou Xin and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, June 4 (Reuters) - Chinese exporters who made a
big push only a year ago to bill in euros are increasingly
turning their backs on the wounded European currency and
demanding dollars instead.
 By contrast, Beijing last week said a report it was
reviewing the euro portion in its mountain of foreign exchange
reserves was groundless and it calmed markets by saying that
Europe remained a key investment market.
 But Chinese exporters and the local governments that
oversee them are less confident. They are trying to keep a
wider berth from the euro, at least for now.
 Hangzhou Natutex Apparel Corp, a producer of special fabric
for outdoor use, ships nearly all of its 10 million yuan ($1.5
million) in annual exports to Europe.
 Last year, when the European economy looked to be on solid
footing, it settled 50 percent of sales in the euro. It has cut
that back to just 5 percent this year.
 ""The reason is obvious. You have to be alert about exchange
rates in the foreign trade business,"" Yu Yueping, Natutex
chairman, said. ""It would be too bad if your hard-earned
profits were eroded by exchange rate changes.""
 The euro has tumbled 17 percent against the yuan in 2010 as
the Chinese currency has been locked in place against a
strengthening dollar.
 SHORT-TERM CONTRACTS
 Local governments are also telling exporters to be cautious
about settling trade in the European currency.
 Trade officials in Jiangsu, a prosperous manufacturing
province, told exporters to sign short-term contracts when
dealing with European clients and to cut back on euro-based
settlements, the Jiangsu Business News reported.
 ""Considering the euro's uncertain future, exports to
European countries should be settled in yuan if possible. If
the buyers do not agree on yuan settlement, then use the
dollar,"" it said.
 More than 80 percent of total Chinese exports are paid for
in dollars, according to local reports. The government had been
trying to change that, to encourage more euro settlement as
part of a broader effort to diversify its foreign exchange
reserves.
 It had seemed a smart -- and easy -- path to
diversification. Not only do euro bond markets offer the only
real rival to the depth and liquidity of U.S. debt markets, but
the European Union is China's biggest export destination,
meaning lots of cash flows from Europe to China every year.
 Times have changed.
 Shishi Daily, official newspaper of an export base in
coastal Fujian province, reported cheerfully last week that its
exporters were doing well after heeding warnings to shun the
euro.
 ""Exporters in Shishi were told by officials via our
newspaper: Don't use the euro, use yuan or the dollar! Many
exporters accepted this suggestion, so even as the euro has
kept falling, exporters in Shishi have not reported heavy
losses,"" it said.
 HOW TO MAKE A SAUSAGE
 Peng Hu's sausage empire in northwestern China has been
less successful.
 His firm, Xinjiang Huarui Casing Products, every year
exports about 50 million yuan worth of the material that
encases sausage fillings to Europe, especially Germany and
Austria. With all his customers paying euros, he has suffered
steep losses.
 ""I have tried hard to ask my clients to settle trade in
other currencies, in dollars or yuan or whatever, just not
euro,"" Peng said. ""They have yet to agree, but I will keep
trying.""
 About 4,000 kms (2,485 miles) away in his textile factory,
Yu reflected on the vagaries of the foreign exchange market.
The dollar would probably not remain his currency of choice
forever.
 ""Life has to move on and the euro may go up again a couple
of years from now,"" Yu said.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - The euro stayed close to a
four-year low on Friday, hemmed in by options expiries with debt
problems weighing on sentiment, while the dollar gained
support on expectations of a strong U.S. employment report.
The single currency has tumbled around 17 percent from its
early 2010 highs as the crisis stemming from indebtedness of some
euro zone countries escalated, fuelling concerns over the health
of the currency bloc's banking sector.
 ""The euro remains under pressure. Even if U.S. jobs come in
weaker than expected, it's likely there will just be a
short-term correction to the upside for the single currency,""
said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank.
 A Reuters poll forecast 513,000 U.S. jobs were created in
May but some in the market are anticipating an even stronger
figure following upbeat data this week.
 ""There is talk of 600,000 jobs being added and that kind of
number would show that the U.S. economy is showing considerable
momentum,"" Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ.
 On Thursday, data showed U.S. private employers added 55,000
jobs in May and on Wednesday President Barack Obama said he
expected the non-farm payrolls report to show strong jobs
growth.
 A robust number would fuel expectations the Federal Reserve
will move first in tightening rates, ahead of the Bank of Japan,
which is tackling deflation, and the European Central Bank.
 At 0715 GMT, the euro was trading with small gains against
the dollar at $1.2170, not far from a four-year low of $1.2110
hit earlier in the week.
 Traders said large option structures were likely to keep the
price action contained on the day.
""We have a large $1.2200 strike in the euro today so that
might make this level very sticky,"" said a trader at a U.S. bank
in London.
 Traders said there was also a huge double-no-touch options
with a $1.21-$1.25 range set to expire later in the day, which
could keep the currency bottled up.
 They were looking for a daily close under the 50 percent
retracement of the 2000-2008 euro rally at $1.2135 to signal the
next leg to the downside.
 The dollar was broadly unchanged on the day versus a
currency basket at 87.074, staying close to a 15-month high hit
on Tuesday at 87.473.
 
 SAFE-HAVEN DEMAND
 As well as gaining support on expectations of an economic
recovery in the United States, safe-haven demand was
underpinning the greenback.
 ""The dollar continues to attract safe-haven buying on the
back of continued concern in the euro zone about sovereign debt
and credit market liquidity with European banks remaining
extremely nervous with respect to their lending between each
other,"" said Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC markets.
 The U.S. dollar stood at 92.75 yen, steady from late U.S.
trade. The greenback rose as high as 92.87 yen in early Asian
trade, its highest in more than two weeks.
 The euro edged up 0.3 percent to 113 yen, staying well above
an 8 1/2-year trough hit below 109 yen last week.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan, a fiscal conservative, was
chosen as Japan's next premier in a ruling party vote on Friday.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses were in favour
of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 03:43AM ET</span>",Swiss should press ahead with financial reform-SNB head," INTERLAKEN, Switzerland, June 4 (Reuters) - Switzerland
should press ahead with financial market reform and not wait for
the international community to act, the chairman of
Switzerland's central bank said on Friday.
 ""Regardless of competition implications, it would be
irresponsible here in Switzerland to wait on regulatory reform
until the relevant international regulation processes are
concluded,"" Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said
in a speech prepared for the Swiss Economic Forum.
 ""In the future all financial institutions must be able to
prove themselves in the market regardless of their size or
structure.""
 Switzerland has spearheaded the global push for tougher bank
rules, requiring its two bank giants, UBS  and
Credit Suisse , to hold twice as much capital as
required by current international standards after Switzerland
bailed out UBS during the credit crisis.
 It has also introduced new liquidity rules, and the
government is expected to propose later this year measures to
avoid a bank failure that would bring the whole economy down.
 Hildebrand said it was essential that the regulatory focus
remains on capital and liquidity measures, and the problem of
banks that are 'too big to fail'.
 ""If in the most important financial centres the core agenda
of the Financial Stability Board isn't acted on, at the end we
will stand there empty-handed,"" he said.
 The Group of 20 has pledged a string of reforms to financial
regulation to avert a rerun of the worst financial crisis since
the 1930s. [ID:nLDE63P1YN]
 G20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in South
Korea on Friday and Saturday to discuss financial regulation.
The FSB was tasked by the G20 to implement reforms.
[ID:nLDE65200B]
 Hildebrand also said the common goal of key financial
centres must be an international procedure to allow global banks
to unwind their activities in an orderly manner in case of a
crisis. But this may not yet be possible, he said.
 ""I realise that right now a single global set of rules for
the orderly unwinding of banks is an unrealistic goal,"" he said.
 ""National sets of rules will continue to co-exist also in
the future,"" he said, adding that there could be a system of
mutual recognition of national rules in this field.
 The domestic banking industry has warned that Switzerland
could suffer as a financial centre if domestic requirements turn
out stricter than international regulations.
 But regulators, led by Hildebrand, have argued that Swiss
banks focusing on wealth management may benefit from stricter
rules as these are likely to boost client trust, key to success
in this area.

 HONG KONG, June 4 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Friday
and Asian stocks slipped on profit taking ahead of a report
expected to show the highest U.S. jobs growth since 1983,
supporting this week's wary move back into riskier assets.
 More than two-thirds of the forecast 513,000 new jobs will
likely be temporary hires for the government census, giving
mixed signals to investors eager to take profits on their
bullish bets on the dollar, which hit a four-year high against
the euro on Tuesday. [ID:nN01175887]
 Financial bookmakers reckoned major European stock indexes
would open up as much as 0.5 percent ahead of the payrolls
report, which is used as a gauge of the U.S. economy. U.S.
stock futures  drifted lower in calm trade.
 Global equity markets and U.S. Treasury yields over the
past week have both recovered nearly a quarter of the losses
incurred over the last two months when the European sovereign
debt crisis triggered a scramble out of risk.
 The U.S. payrolls report may provide a supportive role to
this rebound.
 ""There is talk of 600,000 jobs being added and that kind of
number will show that the U.S. economy is showing considerable
momentum,"" said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ
in Sydney.
 Still, fears about tougher funding conditions in Europe and
the impact of spartan fiscal policy on growth may keep a heavy
lid on the nascent revival in risk taking.
 Indeed, Hungary's ruling party on Thursday said the
country's finances were in much worse shape than previously
expected, an echo of recent warnings from Greece.
[ID:nN03119651]
 The euro was largely unchanged from Thursday in New York at
$1.2178 , still trying to climb from an overnight low of
$1.2150. It touched a four-year low around $1.2110 on Tuesday.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent against the yen at 92.67 yen
. Speculation that Japan's next prime minister will be
more hawkish against yen strength has spurred traders to cut
their bets on the yen this week.

 In equity markets, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks
outside Japan edged down 0.3 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, weighed
mostly by profit taking in the materials sector after a surge
on Thursday.
 The index is trading at 12 times forecast 12-month
earnings, the lowest valuation since March 2009, when the
latest bull market began. That kind of value is probably enough
to pull some investors back into the market, though uncertainty
over Europe could keep intraday volatility high.
 Japan's Nikkei share average <.N225> finished 0.1 percent
lower after posting its biggest single-day rise in six months
on Thursday. Shares of retailers were the biggest drag on the
index, while exporters and technology sector stocks offered
support.
 The prospect of a new prime minister that would keep the
yen weak was seen as a plus for exporters, though it was still
too early to drive trading consistently.
 ""There's still a lot that's unknown -- who will be in the
cabinet, what the policies will be. That makes it hard for the
market to take it up as a factor,"" said Yutaka Miura, senior
technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, June 4 (Reuters) - Hungary's markets fell sharply
on Friday after the prime minister's spokesman supported the
view that his country had only a slim chance of avoiding a
Greek-style debt crisis, although he said it would do so.
 The new government, which was sworn in less than a week ago,
said it would soon announce an action plan to tackle the
economy's problems, after it publishes the figures about the
""true"" state of the 2010 budget this coming weekend or early
next week.
 But nervous markets and investors were spooked by the
government's comments and urged clarity on its plans.
[ID:nLDE6531BS]
 The centre-right government won elections in April by a
landslide, winning a two-thirds majority of seats and ousting
the Socialists, and has said it wanted to boost growth via tax
cuts and economic stimulus measures.
 On Thursday, Fidesz party vice chairman Lajos Kosa was cited
as saying by news website napi.hu that it had found public
finances in a much worse shape than previously expected and
there was only a slim chance of avoiding a Greek-style scenario.
 When asked about those comments, Prime Minister Viktor
Orban's spokesman Peter Szijjarto told a news conference:
 ""It was (former Socialist) Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany
who spoke about a default. Moreover, he proudly said that
Hungary was close to default, he said that a year and a half ago
... and then he was proud that he could only save Hungary from
default by taking the IMF loan.""
 ""From this aspect I do not think (Kosa's comments) are
exaggerated at all.""
 Szijjarto also told the news conference that the previous
government falsified economic data.
""In Hungary the previous government falsified data. In
Greece, they also falsified data. In Greece the moment of truth
has arrived. Hungary is still before that,"" Szijjarto said.
""This is exactly what we want to avoid, and this government
is ready to avoid the path that Greece took. After realising
what reality is, we will not hesitate to act,"" he said.
 Socialist party parliamentary group leader Attila Mesterhazy
said Hungary was not close to default.[ID:nLDE6531M7]
 Szijjarto said the austerity measures and tax hikes which
the Socialist administration tried in the past had failed.
 He said tax cuts would not be delayed even in the face of a
higher budget deficit. It was not clear how that could square
with bringing the deficit under control.
 The previous government regained markets' trust by
containing the deficit at 4 percent of GDP last year with deep
spending cuts, after Hungary resorted to IMF and EU financing in
October 2008 to avert meltdown.
 The country has been financing itself from markets again
this year and has not drawn on any IMF funds so far in 2010.
 
 DEFAULT FEAR
 Financial markets tumbled after the government's comments.
 The forint  plunged over 2 percent versus the
euro to a new one-year low of 289.80 before recovering slightly.
Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) surged 100 basis points to
430 basis points, while bond yields jumped 40-70 basis points.
 The stock of OTP Bank , the country's biggest
lender, closed down 11.1 percent.
 ""The comments made over the past 24 hours are highly
concerning as they not only increase fears in the markets over a
possible Hungarian default, but also clearly demonstrate that
the Hungarian government has very little understanding of how
the financial markets actually work,"" Danske Bank said.
 ""For now, we advise our clients to show utmost caution on
the Hungarian markets as there is a clear risk that this could
escalate further,"" the bank said.
 
 NO CLARITY
 The new government has repeatedly warned in the past few
weeks that the 2010 deficit could be much higher than the target
of 3.8 percent of GDP agreed with the EU and IMF, blaming
""fiscal skeletons"" left by the previous administration.
 Earlier on Friday, Orban said the government's action plan
would include measures to improve finances, but gave no details.
 ""It cannot be about ... an adjustment, about patching up
(the economy) ... measures aimed at improving the financial
situation must be linked with deep structural changes,"" Orban
told TV2 television over the phone from Brussels.
 The European Commission on Thursday urged Hungary to cut its
budget deficit faster.
 The central bank has said the deficit could be 4.5 percent
of GDP or 4.3 percent if the government freezes remaining budget
reserves. Analysts see a deficit of 5 percent .
""The government is now playing a very dangerous game with
investor confidence,"" Timothy Ash of Royal Bank of Scotland
said.
 ""There might be a temptation to talk of the risks of default
to manage expectations domestically towards the need for a
continued tight reign on fiscal policy and the maintenance of
fiscal austerity, but this does not go down well with
investors.""

 TOKYO, June 4 (Reuters) - The dollar retained broad gains on
Friday, supported by expectations that U.S. job figures later in
the day would point to a labour market on the mend, stoking
optimism about future growth in the world's biggest economy.
 The euro stayed under pressure at $1.2166, not far from a
four-year low of $1.2110 hit earlier in the week, with debt
problems and worries about Europe's financial sector still
weighing on investor sentiment.
 There was talk of huge double-no-touch options with a
$1.21-$1.25 range set to expire later on Friday, which could keep
the currency bottled up for now.
 Market participants are turning their focus back to the U.S.
economy as they have become bored with trading on the European
debt woes, which have sparked a steep sell-off in the euro and a
wave of risk reduction in many markets, traders said.
 ""Players are shifting their attention to U.S. data from the
euro zone,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 ""I think the market will react if today's U.S. data shows
solid job growth, unlike what we saw last month when the market
ignored robust jobs numbers.""

 Morriss said a strong non-farm payrolls number would also
give a leg up to riskier assets and higher-yielding currencies.
The Australian dollar rose 0.3 percent to $0.8446 and 0.5
percent against the yen at 78.30 yen.
 Traders are watching to see if the Australian dollar can hold
above the technically key 78.07 yen level -- a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of a fall from April 30 high of 88.08 yen
to a 10-month low of 71.89 yen hit on May 21.
 But analysts have downgraded forecasts for the Australian and
New Zealand dollars as a spike in risk aversion and doubts about
the sustainability of a global recovery prompts investors to cut
positions in higher-yielding currencies.
 The U.S. dollar stood at 92.71 yen, steady from late U.S.
trade. The greenback rose as high as 92.87 yen in early Asian
trade, its highest in more than two weeks.
 The euro edged up 0.1 percent to 112.88, staying well above

 The yen has been under broad pressure against the U.S.
dollar, and on the crosses, in the past few sessions as investors
pared long yen positions built amid a spike in risk aversion last
month.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan, a fiscal conservative once best
known for battling bureaucrats, was chosen to become Japan's next
premier in a ruling party vote on Friday.
 With the market speculating that Kan will adopt a tougher
stance in fighting the yen's strength than his predecessor,

338,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2010 01:04AM ET</span>",New Obama security strategy hardens economic resolve," * Economic prosperity key to Obama's security goals
 * Building an argument to cut defense spending
 * Borrows from Eisenhower's playbook in seeking support
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, June 4 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has
deployed a time-honored U.S. political strategy by casting his
economic goals in terms of national security, and it may boost
his chances of success in cutting the massive U.S. deficit.
 Calls for economic renewal and fiscal discipline are woven
throughout Obama's new National Security Strategy, released
last Thursday, in which he emphatically states America's
strength in the world is determined by domestic prosperity.
 Echoing President Dwight Eisenhower's characterization of
the U.S. interstate highway and federal education in the 1950s
as national security priorities, Obama links sustaining power
abroad to curbing the budget deficit, boosting the economy and
reforming energy policy, education and innovation.
 ""I think this will help (his agenda), particularly in
dealing with the deficit problem,"" said said Lawrence Korb, a
senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a
Washington-based think-tank.
 ""He is laying the foundation for an argument that 'as part
of our deficit reduction I have got to reduce defense spending
and this will make us safer',"" said Korb,
 Obama is pushing lawmakers to act on his policy agenda and
has gathered a bipartisan debt commission to recommend ways to
cut the $1.4 trillion budget deficit and be more disciplined
in the future. It is due to render its opinion by Dec. 1.
 The solution is likely to incorporate a mixture of spending
cuts and tax increases. Other analysts agree linking economic
strength at home with national security, while constantly
emphasizing the need to prioritize, helps the national security
strategy create a basis for defense budget cuts.
 ""The discussion of the need to make hard choices in general
... and promising to give citizens all the facts so that they
could judge the costs of ongoing military operations, sounds
like the administration is stockpiling talking points for
cutbacks in the security budget,"" said Lou Crandall, chief
economist at financial research firm Wrightson ICAP in Jersey
City, New Jersey.
 Defense spending, at $660 billion, accounted for almost 18
percent of the federal budget in fiscal year 2010.
 Obama's debut declaration of national security goals,
required by law of every president, extends a bipartisan hand
by leaning on Eisenhower's justification for expanding the
federal government by citing national security.
 The Republican president's 1956 law clearing massive
federal spending on statewide highways was called the National
Defense Highways Act. Likewise, federal funding of education
was approved under the National Defense Education Act of 1958.
 CHANNELING EISENHOWER
 In fact, Obama in December directly invoked his predecessor
during a speech at West Point outlining a new Afghan strategy
which was itself a coded reference to budget cuts.
 ""I'm mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who --
in discussing our national security -- said, ""Each proposal
must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the
need to maintain balance in and among national programs,"" Obama
told the assembled U.S. Corp of Cadets.
 Obama's defense document emphasizes soft power,
distinguishing it from the focus on fighting terrorism and
preemptive war laid out in President George W. Bush's defense
strategy after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.
 In contrast, Obama's vision carries the clear imprint of an
administration governing in the wake of the 2008-2009 global
financial crisis, which forced him to aggressively expand
public spending to restart growth.
 Obama's $787 billion emergency stimulus package, together
with the impact of the worst recession in 50 years and the cost
of fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has pushed the U.S.
national debt above $12 trillion.
 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton explicitly
connected deficit reduction with national security in remarks
after the Obama strategy was released.
 ""We cannot sustain this level of deficit financing and debt
without losing our influence, without being constrained in the
tough decisions we have to make,"" Clinton said, adding that it
was time to ""make the national security case about reducing the
deficit and getting the debt under control.""
 Sustaining confidence of foreign investors in the might of
world's only superpower is also vital to financing its debts.
 Foreign creditors hold $3.9 trillion of U.S. government
debt, led by China's $895 billion stake, which potentially saps
U.S. leverage over a powerful rival with whom it could clash.
 This is particularly true of Taiwan, where China claims
sovereignty and which the United States has pledged to defend.
 ""It affects the whole image of the United States and of
U.S. power around the world if the U.S. is heading toward
becoming an economic basket case,"" said Reginald Dale, senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a
Washington think-tank.
 ""If you owe all this money you become less independent in
the broader sense because you have to worry about where you are
going to raise the next loan,"" he said.

(Adds quote on Greece)
 By David Milliken
 BUSAN, South Korea, June 4 (Reuters) - The IMF needs more
funds after supporting Greece's bailout and should ""very
significantly"" increase the amount of special drawing rights, the
head of the Fund's policy-steering committee said on Friday.
 Egyptian finance minister Youssef Boutros-Ghali told Reuters
that Greece's problems were not over yet and there were doubts
about its ability to implement the reforms demanded by the IMF
and European Union in return for a 110 billion euro ($135
billion) aid package.
 ""We are not out of the woods,"" he said in an interview. ""The
measures they have been required to implement are fairly tough.
And there are in some areas doubts whether they are able to
continue implementing such tough measures.""
 Boutros-Ghali is the first official from an emerging economy
to head the IMF's International Monetary and Financial Committee,
and said the Fund should raise money from members by issuing more
SDRs, its de facto currency, instead of borrowing.
 ""If we are going to start including funds made available to
Europe, then the IMF is not properly resourced,"" he said.
 ""We need to increase SDRs very significantly. But we also
need to shift the structure of resources from mostly borrowing
and some SDRs to mostly SDRs,"" he continued, adding that members
had been talking about a doubling of the SDR allocation.
 Two allocations of SDRs last year -- the first in 30 years --
increased the International Monetary Fund's stock of SDRs almost
10-fold to total about SDR 204 billion ($313 billion). China has
suggested emerging economies buy more SDRs in return for
increased voting rights.
 G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs are meeting in
the South Korean port city of Busan to lay the groundwork for G20
leaders' meetings in Toronto on June 26-27 and in Seoul in
November.
 Boutros-Ghali said that he was working on boosting emerging
economies voting rights at the IMF, but that it was unlikely a
deal would be reached by the Seoul summit -- an informal deadline
set by world leaders.
 ""It's not easy and it's not straightforward. Given the
problems I think there's a slightly less than 50 percent chance
that it will succeed,"" he said.
 SDRs are made up of a basket of dollars, euros, yen and
pounds, and Boutros-Ghali said diversification was needed over
the long run.
 ""I don't question the need to widen the basket. What we have
to take into account is that a currency (to be added to the
basket) is broadly available ... and traded according to
transparent mechanisms.""
 DRESSING UP FOR DINNER?
 Brazil has suggested the basket be widened to include its
real and the Chinese yuan, and Boutros-Ghali said that this
prospect may provide a gentle nudge in the direction of making
China's currency more freely traded.
 ""As long as you are not required to dress up properly and you
are not invited for a dinner, you do not dress up. The minute you
are invited you dress up.""
 The United States has repeatedly called on China to allow the
yuan to move more freely and appreciate against the dollar to
boost demand for U.S. goods.
 But Boutros-Ghali said the currency should not be treated in
isolation as credit conditions and government fiscal policy were
also important drivers of any country's domestic demand.
 Nonetheless, countries which ran current account surpluses
needed to act to offset the adverse effect on global growth of
U.S. and European efforts to rein in budget deficits, he added.
 Boutros-Ghali played down the likelihood and importance of a
G20 agreement over a global bank tax -- supported by the United
States and the EU, but rejected by Canada and Brazil.
 ""Will countries agree on the principle first and then the
level of the tax? No,"" he said.
 ""The bank levy is one of many measures and certainly not the
most important one. Having good regulatory infrastructure that
watches over leverage, that watches over risk management, that
watches over banks across the world, is a lot more important.""

 HONG KONG, June 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and Asian
stocks held on to recent gains on Friday ahead of a report
expected to show the highest U.S. jobs growth since 1983,
supporting a cautious shift back into riskier assets this week.
 However, more than two-thirds of the forecast 513,000 new
jobs will likely be temporary hires for the government census,
giving mixed signals to investors eager to take profits on
their bullish bets on the dollar, which hit a four-year high
against the euro on Tuesday.
 Global equity markets and U.S. Treasury yields roughly over
the past week have both recovered nearly a quarter of the
losses incurred over the last two months when the European
sovereign debt crisis triggered a scramble out of risk.
 The U.S. payrolls report may provide a supportive role to
this rebound.
 ""There is talk of 600,000 jobs being added and that kind of
number will show that the U.S. economy is showing considerable
momentum,"" said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ

 Still, fears about tougher funding conditions in Europe and
the impact of spartan fiscal policy on growth may keep a heavy
lid on the nascent revival in risk taking.
 Indeed, Hungary's ruling party on Thursday said the
country's finances were in much worse shape than previously
expected, an echo of recent warnings from Greece.
 The euro was largely unchanged from late on Thursday in New
York at $1.2175, still trying to climb from an overnight low of
$1.2150.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen to 92.74 yen.
Speculation that Japan's next prime minister will be much more
hawkish against yen strength has spurred traders to cut their
bets on the yen this week.
 The ruling party will vote on a new prime minister on
Friday, with current Finance Minister Naoto Kan expected to
win.
 In equity markets, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks
outside Japan edged down 0.5 percent, weighed mostly by profit
taking in the materials sector after a surge on Thursday.
 The index is trading at 12 times forecast 12-month

latest bull market began. That kind of value is probably enough
to pull some investors back into the market, though uncertainty

 Japan's Nikkei share average trimmed early gains to trade
unchanged on the day. Shares of retailers were the biggest drag

 TOKYO, June 4 (Reuters) - The dollar retained broad gains
on Friday, supported by expectations U.S. jobs data later in
the day would point to the labour market on the mend, stoking
optimism about future growth in the world's biggest economy.
 The euro stayed under pressure at $1.2166, not far from a
four-year low of $1.2110 hit earlier in the week, with debt
problems and worries about Europe's financial sector still
weighing down on investor sentiment.
 There is talk of huge double-no-touch options with a
$1.21-$1.25 range set to expire later on Friday, which could
keep the currency bottled up for now.
 Market participants are turning their focus back to the
U.S. economy as they have become bored with trading on the
European debt woes, which have sparked a steep sell-off in the
euro and a wave of risk reduction in many markets, traders
said.
 ""Players are shifting their attention to U.S. data from the
euro zone,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 ""I think the market will react if today's U.S. data shows
solid job growth, unlike what we saw last month when the market
ignored robust jobs numbers.""
 The dollar index was at 87.155 and not far from 15-month
highs hit on Tuesday, with the focus on the 87.47 resistance
area if the job numbers surprise on the upside.
 A Reuters poll forecast U.S. payrolls data to show 513,000
jobs created in May but some in the market though are
anticipating an even stronger figure following upbeat data this
week.
 ""There is talk of 600,000 jobs being added and that kind of
numbers will show that the U.S. economy is showing considerable
momentum,"" Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ.
 On Thursday, data showed U.S. private employers added
55,000 jobs in May, according to a private report..
 A robust number would fuel expectations that the U.S.
Federal Reserve will move first in tightening rates, ahead of
the Bank of Japan, which is still tackling deflation, and the
European Central Bank.
 Morriss added a strong non-farm payrolls number should also
give a leg up to riskier assets and higher-yielding currencies.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.1 percent at $0.8431 and 0.2
percent against the yen at 78.13 yen.
 Traders eye whether the Australian dollar could hold above
the technically key 78.07 yen level -- a 38.2 percent Fibonacci
retracement of a fall from April 30 high of 88.08 yen to a
10-month low of 71.89 yen hit on May 21.
 The U.S. dollar stood at 92.71 yen, steady from late U.S.
trade. The greenback rose as high as 92.87 yen in early Asian
trade, its highest in more than two weeks.
 The euro was little changed versus the yen at 112.71,
staying well above an 8 1/2-year trough hit below 109 yen last
week.
 The yen has been broadly under pressure against the U.S.
dollar, and on the crosses, in the past few session as
investors pared long yen positions built amid a spike in risk
aversion last month.
 Also, with the market speculating Japan's next prime
minister would take a tougher stance in fighting the yen's
strength, traders took that as an opportunity to cut positions.
 Japanese media reported on Friday that Finance Minister
Naoto Kan looked all set to become the next premier.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses were in favour
of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen.
 The ruling Democratic Party of Japan on Friday votes on a
successor of unpopular Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who quit
this week to improve his party's chances in an upcoming upper
house poll the ruling bloc needs to win to avoid policy
deadlock. The results are due around 0330 GMT.

 TORONTO, June 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar backpedaled
from a two-week high against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as
market players reduced risky positions ahead of Friday's double
serving of jobs reports from Canada and the United States.
 The currency  began the session firmer, hitting its
highest level since May 18 at C$1.0333 to the U.S. dollar, or
96.78 U.S. cents, as oil prices rose and global equity markets
rallied on growing investor risk appetite.
 It closed at C$1.0412 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.04 U.S.
cents, down from Wednesday's close of C$1.0384 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.30 U.S. cents.
 ""It's following risk flows today. We're stuck in a broader
range for the Canadian dollar,"" said Tyson Wright, senior
foreign exchange trader at Custom House, a currency services
firm.
 Canada's dollar absorbed tepid May U.S. retail sales data
on Thursday as well as reports that the U.S. added
private-sector jobs in May and that jobless claims dipped in
the latest week. But the main course is the U.S. May jobs
report on Friday, which may provide vital evidence on the state
of economic recovery. [ID:nN0360959] 
 According to a Reuters poll, U.S. nonfarm payrolls probably
recorded a fifth straight month of gains in May, but survey
respondents said more than two-thirds of the projected 513,000
jobs will be temporary hires for the U.S. census.
[ID:nN01175887] [ID:nN02176933] 
 Canadian job statistics are also on tap on Friday, with a
median forecast for a net gain of 12,500 jobs in May after a
record gain of 108,700 in April. The median forecast for the
unemployment rate is 8.1 percent. [ID:nECICA] [ID:nN01257964]
 ""If Canada can post solid employment data to follow up on
last month's impressive numbers, then this trend will probably
be skewed slightly to the downside for dollar/Canada as the
fundamental backdrop is very favorable for more (Canadian)
interest rate hikes,"" Wright said.
 The Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate on Tuesday,
the first G7 industrialized economy to do so after the global
recession. Rate rises are likely to be a driving force for
further Canadian dollar strength in the short and medium term,
though European debt woes may cap gains, a Reuters poll found
on Thursday. [ID:nN01264788] [ID:nN03238967]
 Higher rates typically help a currency by attracting
capital flows.
 The market is expected to focus on the next key technical
levels of support at C$1.0304 to the U.S. dollar, as well as
C$1.0280, said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange trading
at BMO Capital Markets.

 Canadian bond prices were slightly higher at the short end
of the curve, while long bonds dipped in advance of Friday's

 The two-year Canadian government bond  edged up 4
Canadian cents to yield 1.757 percent, while the 10-year bond

 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose broadly
on Thursday as investors debated the outlook for the U.S. labor
market a day ahead of the government's key non-farm payrolls
report and became increasingly risk averse.
 The euro, and to some extent the dollar, gained early on
bullish bets for a strong reading of U.S. payrolls data but
later bearish investors bought dollars on risk aversion in case
expectations for jobs growth are too high.
 The euro touched a session low against the U.S. dollar and
Swiss franc due to technical trading and position adjustment
ahead of U.S. payrolls, dealers said.
 The yen fell for a second day versus the dollar due to
political uncertainty in Japan.
 ""There is a bit of concern about the jobs number with the
bar being set high,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency
research at GFT in New York. ""There is a strong chance the
non-farm payrolls number could fall short of expectations.""
 A weekly government reading on U.S. jobless claims and a
monthly report on private-sector jobs released on Thursday
showed signs of support for the U.S. economy. That prompted
analysts to upgrade forecasts for monthly payrolls data.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro was last
down 0.7 percent at $1.2160, near the session low of $1.2153
 on Reuters data. The euro touched a more than four year
low against the dollar on Tuesday at $1.2110 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 A Reuters poll gave a consensus forecast U.S. payrolls data
would show 513,000 jobs created in May. [ID:nN02176933] 
 Some economists are anticipating an even stronger figure,
with BNP Paribas upgrading its forecast to an increase of
615,000. U.S. President Barack Obama added to optimism, saying
on Wednesday the report would show strong growth.
[ID:nN02175839]
 The number of U.S. workers filing new applications for
unemployment insurance fell as expected last week, according to
government data. U.S. private employers added 55,000 jobs in
May, according to a private report. For details, see
[ID:nEAP102300] and [ID:nN02211844]
 ""These reports show the labor market is in fact
stabilizing,"" said John Doyle, senior currency strategist at
Tempus Consulting, Washington. ""Fundamentals here are much
stronger than they are across the pond, so that means interest
rates should go up here first.""
 But given such lofty expectations for the Friday report,
analysts said caution would be required going into the data
given the heavy bullish positioning.
 A sell-off in euro/Swiss franc came simultaneous with the
drop in euro/dollar. Traders said markets took out weak stops
in euro/dollar at $1.2220 and below 1.4100 in euro/swiss.
 They added that option expiries in the single currency
between $1.2300 and $1.2200 at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) may have
helped push the euro lower across the board.
 The single currency was last down 0.6 percent against the
Swiss franc at 1.4064 .
 THE YEN
 The dollar was up 0.4 percent versus the yen  at
92.57 yen. The euro  was down 0.3 percent against the
Japanese currency at 112.55 yen having earlier rallied above
114.00.
 The dollar's two-day advance against the yen was the best
two-day move since May 10 at current prices.
 Also, with the market speculating Japan's next prime
minister would take a tougher stance in fighting the yen's
strength, traders took this as an opportunity to trim long
positions in the currency.
 Finance minister and candidate for ruling party head -- and
the premiership -- Naoto Kan surprised markets earlier this
year by saying he wanted the yen to weaken more and that most
businesses were in favor of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen.

(Updates with quotes, details, background; changes dateline)
 By Krisztina Than and Marcin Grajewski
 BUDAPEST, June 3 (Reuters) - The European Commission on
Thursday urged Hungary to cut its budget deficit faster, even as
government officials reiterated the 2010 fiscal gap may reach
almost twice the target agreed with lenders including the EU.
 The new centre-right government, which had promised tax cuts
to boost growth, has warned in the past few weeks that the
deficit could be much higher than the agreed target of 3.8
percent of GDP, blaming ""fiscal skeletons"" left by the previous
Socialist administration.
 A top government official again said on Thursday that the
deficit could be 7.0-7.5 percent.
 The vice chairman of the ruling Fidesz party, Lajos Kosa,
said the government would launch a crisis management plan soon.
 Public finances were in much worse shape than previously
expected and there was only a slim chance of avoiding a
Greek-style scenario, news portal napi.hu cited him as saying.
 Analysts, who on average project a deficit of around 5
percent  this year, said suggestions Hungary's state of
finances were comparable to Greece were misleading and wrong.
 ""We maintain our view that budget deficit can be around 5
percent of GDP in this year and around 4 percent in 2011, but it
doesn't mean that Hungary is close to bankruptcy,"" said David
Nemeth at ING.
 ""Overall, Hungarian newsflow is quite concerning and even if
the negative rhetoric is 'just politics' we advise that more bad
news might well be in the pipeline. The comparison with Greece
might be 'overdone', but one can hardly say that public finances
are in good shape in Hungary,"" Danske Bank added in a note.
 While there were risks in the budget and the target could be
missed without supplementary measures, the government needed to
be wary of rhetorical excess at a time of market nervousness
over the euro zone's debt problems, analysts said.
 The forint  fell 2.6 percent versus the euro after
Kosa's comments while bond yields jumped up to 30 basis points.
 
 MARKET CONFIDENCE
 The European Commission warned Hungary on Thursday against
losing the confidence of financial markets.
 Speaking after talks with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
Orban, Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: ""The
message to Hungary ... is to accelerate fiscal consolidation,
not to reduce it. To go against fiscal consolidation in Europe
today would be a disaster.
 ""Hungary is in a very delicate situation, so no
complacency.""
 A run on its currency after the financial crisis erupted in
2008 forced Budapest to seek a $25 billion rescue from the EU
and IMF to avoid economic collapse.
 Orban said he would keep the budget deficit under control
but declined to give any details. He said his government needed
to verify figures left by the previous administration.
 ""No matter what those figures will show us, I told ... Mr
Barroso that within 72 hours I will have an action plan in terms
of short-term ... and other changes that will ensure the rise of
the competitiveness of the country,"" Orban said.
 Orban's government has not yet provided clear direction on
tax cuts or other aspects of fiscal policy, or on how it plans
to boost employment after last year's recession when the economy
shrank 6.3 percent. It is seen growing modestly in 2010
.
 The central bank said on Wednesday the deficit could be 4.5
percent of GDP or 4.3 percent if the government freezes
remaining budget reserves.
 Analysts said it was also possible Fidesz was trying to back
out from its earlier tax cut pledges by projecting a crisis
scenario.
 ""So the question is that Fidesz has a only bad communication
technique or they have no idea what to do,"" Nemeth said.
 ""In the case of the former ... it would mean that they want
to introduce a really tight fiscal policy... and they want
simply to back out of their promises and they want to cool down
slightly the overheated expectations.""
 Analysts said the new government needed to act fast to
reasssure nervous financial markets.
 ""The government needs to move quickly to restore market
confidence, and prevent the sell-off getting out of hand. It
needs to be entirely transparent in terms of its reform plans
going forward, and the state of play with respect to the IMF/EU
programme,"" said Timothy Ash at Royal Bank of Scotland.

 * Yen slips vs dollar as political uncertainty weighs
 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose broadly
on Thursday as investors debated the outlook for the U.S. labor
market ahead of the key non-farm payrolls report set for
release on Friday and became increasingly risk averse.
 The dollar first rose on bets for a strong reading of U.S.
payrolls data but later bearish investors also bought dollars
on risk aversion in case expectations for jobs growth are too
high. The euro touched a session low against the U.S. dollar
and Swiss franc due to technical trading and position
adjustment ahead of U.S. payrolls, dealers said.
 The yen fell for a second day versus the dollar due to
political uncertainty in Japan.
 ""There is a bit of concern about the jobs number with the
bar being set high,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency
research at GFT in New York. ""There is a strong chance the
non-farm payrolls number could fall short of expectations.""
 A weekly government reading on U.S. jobless claims and a
monthly report on private-sector jobs released on Thursday
showed signs of support for the U.S. economy. That prompted
analysts to upgrade forecasts for monthly payrolls data.
 In mid afternoon trading in New York, the euro was last
down 0.7 percent at $1.2160, near the session low of $1.2153
.
 A Reuters poll gave a consensus forecast U.S. payrolls data
would show 513,000 jobs created in May. [ID:nN02176933]

615,000. U.S. President Barack Obama added to optimism, saying
on Wednesday the report would show strong growth.
[ID:nN02175839]
 The number of U.S. workers filing new applications for
unemployment insurance fell as expected last week, according to
government data. U.S. private employers added 55,000 jobs in
May, according to a private report. For details, see

 A sell-off in euro/Swiss franc came simultaneous with the
drop in euro/dollar. Traders said markets took out weak stops
in euro/dollar at $1.2220 and below 1.4100 in euro/swiss.
 They added that option expiries in the single currency
between $1.2300 and $1.2200 at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) may have
helped push the euro lower across the board.
 The single currency was last down 0.5 percent against the

92.31 yen. The euro  was down 0.6 percent against the
Japanese currency at 112.28 yen having earlier rallied above

 The dollar's two-day advance against the yen was the best
two-day move since May 10 at current prices.

 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose broadly
on Thursday on bets for a strong reading for U.S. payrolls data
while the yen fell for a second day versus the dollar due to
political uncertainty in Japan.
 Expectations for a strong payrolls report on Friday whet
appetite for riskier assets and pushed the Australian and New
Zealand dollars higher, along with some emerging market
currencies. Investors tend to sell the low-yielding yen to fund
such investments.

stronger U.S. data is positive for the dollar,"" said Alan
Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS Global Banking &
Markets, in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""If U.S. data leads a risk downturn some questions will be
asked of U.S. core fundamentals, but for now, the tendency is
to give the U.S. the benefit of the doubt, and the euro no
benefit."" 
 In late morning trading in New York, the dollar was up 0.3
percent versus the yen at 92.40 yen. The euro was little
changed against the Japanese currency at 112.90 yen having
earlier rallied above 114.00.
 ""We're seeing the yen weaken overall..., which is pretty
much an indication that risk-taking has rebounded in this
market,"" said Joe Manimbo, a senior market analyst at Travelex
Global Business Payments, in Washington.
 Also, with the market speculating Japan's next prime

 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Global stocks hit a
two-week high on Thursday while the Japanese yen came under
additional pressure as expectations that Friday's U.S. jobs
data will be stronger than forecast encouraged investors to
take on risk.
 Prices of gold and U.S. Treasuries fell as risk appetite
increased following a report that significantly revised up the
number of private sector jobs created in the United States in
April. Jobs created in May were fewer than forecast, however.
 But U.S. stocks lost some ground after data showing the
U.S. non-manufacturing sector grew less than expected in May,
even as it added workers for the first time since December
2007.
 For details on recent data, see [ID:nN0360959]
and[ID:nN03226084].
 ""You have a combination of economic data and stocks with a
much better tone today,"" said Richard Lee, managing director of
fixed income at Wall Street Access in New York. ""The
flight-to-quality has started to fade a bit.""
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS>
climbed 1.0 percent, having earlier reached highs last seen on
May 19.
 On Wall Street, however, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> edged up 5.06 points, or 0.05 percent, to 10,254.60. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 0.49 points, or 0.04
percent, at 1,098.87, and The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
gained 5.35 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,286.42.
 Wall Street investors were also focusing on the performance
of retailer companies, which reported an average growth of 2.5
percent in their May same-store sales, slightly under the
expectation of a 2.6 percent growth. The S&P retail index
<.RLX> was practically flat.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top
European shares put on 1.3 percent, with financial shares such
as Banco Santander  and Barclays  among the
bright spots.
 Energy stocks ended a four-day losing run, with BP ,
which had been battered by the Gulf of Mexico disaster, rising
0.5 percent. 
 Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei share average <.N225> rose over 3.0
percent, posting its biggest one-day rise in six months.
Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> rallied 1.7 percent,
according to an MSCI index.
 YEN PRESSURED
 The Japanese currency, already on a shaky footing with
political uncertainty in Japan weighing, fell across the board.
The dollar rose 0.22 percent versus the yen  to 92.38.
 ""Financial market conditions have stabilized in the near
term. There's renewed risk-taking and that leads to a weaker
yen,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 Also, with the market speculating that Japan's next prime
minister would take a tougher stance in fighting the yen's
strength, traders took this as an opportunity to trim long
positions in the currency.
 Finance minister and candidate for ruling party head -- and
the premiership -- Naoto Kan surprised markets earlier this
year by saying he wanted the yen to weaken more and that most
businesses were in favor of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar <.DXY> was
up 0.29 percent. The euro  was down 0.44 percent at
$1.2195.
 Government bond yields rose as appetite for safe-haven
assets weakened. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes
 was down 5/32, with the yield at 3.3658 percent.
 Gold  fell 0.58 percent, to $1,215.80, but U.S. crude
oil futures  rose 0.07 percent, to $72.91 per barrel.

 * 
 (Adds economist, mortgage lenders association comments)
 By Anna Ringstrom
 COPENHAGEN, June 3 (Reuters) - Economists on Thursday played
down the risk to Denmark's large mortgage bond market, and
thereby the economy, from proposed Basel III banking reforms.
 Denmark's independent Economic Council, also known as the
""wise men"", said planned international regulations to strengthen
the banking sector would effectively make Danish short
adjustable rate mortgage loans more expensive.
 But they also said that such bonds are a source of
instability and the country can do without them.
 That jars with messages from the government, the banking
sector and the central bank that the new regulation may
undermine the entire Danish mortgage lending system.
[ID:nLDE638125][ID:nLDE63L24A][ID:nWEB2819][ID:nDKT004925]
 The Danish mortgage market -- the third-biggest by value
after the U.S. and German -- accounts for two thirds of the
total Danish bond market.
 Coupons on adjustable rate loans are reset every year or up
to every five years.
 ""These loans can in their current form hardly be seen as
necessary for Danish financing of home buying,"" the wisemen said
in a twice-yearly report on the Danish economy.
 No Danish mortgage bank has defaulted on its payments since
the system was created in 1795, and many in Denmark want the
country's mortgage bonds to be seen as fully liquid assets on
par with government bonds.
 ""Because the short adjustable rate mortgage loans can add to
macroeconomic instability, it would not necessarily be bad for
the Danish economy if households were in reality forced to
exchange part of the very short adjustable rate mortgage loans
for more stable, possibly fixed-rate loans,"" the wisemen said.
 The Basel III proposals would limit financial institutions'
use of mortgage bonds as liquidity instruments, which many say
would harm Denmark's home loan system based on such bonds.
 The market value of Danish mortgage bonds is about 2.3
trillion crowns ($416 billion), or 1.4 times Denmark's GDP.
 Under the Basel III proposal, expected to become effective
end-2012, corporate and mortgage bonds would not be allowed to
exceed 50 percent of a bank's liquid assets and could only be
included at up to 60-80 percent of market value.
 That could force Danish financial institutions to shift
large parts of their liquidity portfolios out of mortgage bonds
and into government securities.
 Danish households and businesses have 1.13 trillion crowns
worth of adjustable-rate mortgage loans, the association of
Danish mortgage lenders said in a statement.
 ""The wisemen argue that the adjustable-rate loans are
financially unstable because the interest rate may rise. But if
the adjustable-rate loans are abolished there will be new types
of loans with variable rates,"" the association said.
 These new types of loans could be expected to cost at least
0.5 percent more than the existing, increasing Danes' borrowing
costs by 5.6 billion crowns or more annually, it said.
 Nordea chief economist Helge Pedersen said borrowing costs
would probably rise by 6.2 billion crowns per year, equal to
3,692 crowns per house, if households were left to fixed-rate
loans.
 ""Scrapping variable rate loans overnight would thus be a
hard blow to Danish home owners and the Danish economy,"" he said
in a note to clients.

 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - The yen fell broadly on
Thursday as renewed appetite for risk in global markets and
political uncertainty in Japan weighed on the currency.
 Speculation that there would be a strong reading of U.S.
jobs data due on Friday prompted demand for riskier currencies,
pushing the Australian and New Zealand dollars higher.
Investors tend to sell the low-yielding yen to fund such
investments.
 A weekly government reading on the U.S. labor market and a
monthly report on private-sector jobs released on Thursday
showed signs that were ""supportive"" for the U.S. economy,
analysts said.
 ""We're seeing the yen weaken overall and the U.S. dollar
fall against the commodity currencies, which is pretty much an
indication that risk-taking has rebounded in this market,"" said
Joe Manimbo, a senior market analyst at Travelex Global
Business Payments, in Washington.
 In morning trading in New York, the dollar was up 0.4
percent versus the yen  at 92.55 yen. The euro 
also held gains of around 0.4 pct versus the Japanese currency
at 113.37 yen having earlier rallied above 114.00.
 Stock markets around the world have been stabilizing after
deep losses last month on concerns about Greece's debt woes.
 European shares <.FTEU3> rose, pulling further away from a
nine-month low hit last week and U.S. stock index futures
indicated a higher opening on Wall Street.
 ""Financial market conditions have stabilized in the
near-term. There's renewed risk-taking and that leads to a
weaker yen,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 Also, with the market speculating that Japan's next prime

 Finance minister and candidate for ruling party head -- and
the premiership -- Naoto Kan surprised markets earlier this
year by saying he wanted the yen to weaken more and that most
businesses were in favor of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen.
 The euro traded close to flat versus the dollar  at
$1.2250, slipping from the day's high of $1.2326 as traders
said option expiries at $1.2300 and $1.2200 were set to contain
price action into the 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) New York expiry time.
 The single currency has found its footing after sliding to
$1.2110 on Tuesday, its weakest in more than four years.
 The Australian dollar  rallied 0.8 percent versus
the U.S. dollar to $0.8478. with the New Zealand dollar
 gaining around 0.6 percent against the greenback at
$0.6857.

 By Nicholas Vinocur
 STOCKHOLM, June 3 (Reuters) - The Norwegian and Swedish
crowns, northern Europe's largest currencies, are expected to
strengthen against the euro but weaken against the dollar in the
next 12 months, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
 The Swedish crown has recovered some ground against the
dollar and gained steadily against the euro since the start of
2010, firming as worries over a debt crisis in southern Europe
shook confidence in the single currency.
 Analysts polled by Reuters see the trend continuing against
the euro, with the crown firming to 9.3 in 12 months from 9.5
on Thursday, according to a median forecast of 33 analysts.
 Against the dollar, however, the crown is seen weakening to
8.0 in a year from 7.7 on Thursday.
 Analysts said the Swedish currency would gain against the
euro due to expectations that the central bank will start
raising interest rates as early as July 1 against a backdrop of
improving economic prospects.
 ""The main factors are Riksbank rate hikes, continued growth
outperformance relative to trading partners ... and overall
sound economic fundamentals,"" said Carl Hammer, a currency
strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 Worries over the possibility that Greece could default on
some of its government debt payments have battered the euro and
could push it even lower against most European trading partners,
helping the crown, Hammer added.
 But the crown is expected to lose ground against the dollar
in the coming year, with the U.S. economic recovery gathering
momentum as euro zone governments tighten their belts.
 ""The basic story is that the U.S. recovery is picking up
steam. At the same time the euro outlook has become more gloomy
due to the sovereign debt crisis,"" said Cecilia Skingsley, head
analyst at Swedbank.
 Sweden's economy looks set to expand more than 3 percent
this year, according to the National Institute of Economic
Research (NIER), a leading government research body, outpacing
the more sluggish pace of growth in much of the euro zone.
 While the rest of Europe has kept borrowing costs low to
avoid strangling fragile growth, Norway recently hiked its key
policy rate for the third time since autumn last year as the
oil-based economy outpaced the euro zone.
 In 12 months, the Norwegian crown was seen at 6.5 against
the dollar against 6.4 on Thursday. Versus the euro the crown is
seen strengthening to 7.6 against 7.9 currently.
 However, with another rate hike expected in September,
analysts highlighted risks if the Norwegian crown continued to
strengthen.
 ""The Norges bank is fighting fiercely against strength in
Nokkie (Norwegian crown) to keep it from leading to deflation,""
Hammer said.

364,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2010 09:16AM ET</span>",Major currencies seen less volatile this month," BANGALORE, June 3 (Reuters) - The euro, sterling and yen
will be less volatile in June after a month of turmoil in the
currency markets, according to calculations derived from the
monthly Reuters foreign exchange poll.
 The conclusion is based on the standard deviation of
forecasts in the June currency survey, coupled with the
actual levels of one-month annualised volatility seen last
month.
 The unexpected move by the German government to ban naked
short-selling as a response to the euro zone debt crisis
pressured the euro during May.
 This saw the euro trade in a volatile range, going as low as
1.214 and rising to a high of over 1.33 in May, the widest
trading range since March 2009. Monthly annualised volatility
spiked to 17.7 percent, the highest since January 2009.
 The latest Reuters foreign exchange poll suggests that will
dip to 13.1 percent in June.
 ""The evolution of the crisis has not only been a near-term
negative for the euro, but signals poorly for its medium and
longer-term future,"" said Mengxian Jiao, currency strategist at
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
 Dollar/yen traded in a wide range between 88.0 and just
below 95.0 as worries over contagion from Greece's debt crisis
triggered investor risk aversion around the globe.
 ""The (yen) is likely to remain choppy in the immediate
period ahead on remaining risk aversion and then enter a gradual
downward trend from mid-year,"" said Jiao.
 The poll suggested monthly annualised volatility of 11.9
percent for dollar/yen, lower than the 18.7 percent actual
volatility seen last month.
 As concerns over the outcome of the UK general elections
were laid to rest in May with the formation of a coalition
government, strategists felt fiscal troubles in Britain could
pull the pound lower.
 ""The latest strength in sterling should be short-lived,""
said Neils Christensen, chief foreign exchange analyst at
Nordea. ""The serious budget problems in the UK are bound to put
a damper on sustained rise of sterling,"" he added.
 For sterling against the dollar, volatility was seen
falling to 9.4 percent this month from an actual 14.0 percent in
May.
 Analysts say the divergence of forecasts in Reuters currency
polls offers a leading indicator of exchange rate volatility in
the following month.
 Statistical analysis suggests that the more analysts'
forecasts diverge for a currency pair, the higher the actual
one-month annualised volatility is likely to be in that currency
in the following month.
 Estimates of future monthly annualised volatility are used
to calculate the value of currency options, which give investors
the right to buy or sell a currency at a fixed price in the
future.
 Generally, as a measure of financial risk, the wider the
expected trading range for a currency the higher the cost of
purchasing an option to trade it.

firm against the dollar so long as financial markets remain
jittery although the latest Reuters poll still calls for a
gradual depreciation to 100 per dollar in a year.
 The monthly survey of around 60 foreign exchange
strategists, which was taken mostly before Prime Minister Yukio
Hatoyama's resignation on Wednesday, had a generally firmer
near-term outlook for the yen compared with the May poll.
 The yen is expected to end June at 92 to the dollar, about
where it is now and compared to 94 in the previous poll. It is
seen trading at 95.7 in six months.
 The 12-month dollar/yen consensus of roughly 100 has been
unshakeable for the past year of Reuters foreign exchange polls.
But it hasn't traded at that level since April 2009.
 Near-term dollar/yen forecasts were bunched together in a
narrow 88-95 range, but on the 12-month horizon the range
widened to 70-115 from 85-112 in the last poll, suggesting
greater uncertainty about the outlook.
 While strategists are predicting a gradual depreciation in
the yen, those estimates are far from the 123 per dollar it was
trading at just before the onset of the financial crisis nearly
three years ago.
 ""The yen continues to defy fundamentals. Risk aversion gives
a helping hand to the Japanese currency while the fundamental
backdrop continues to support yen weakness,"" said Niels
Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea.
 Indeed, worries about persistent deflation in the Japanese
economy, its exposure to world demand through its export base as
well as its enormous debt pile are still taking a back seat to
trends in global financial markets.
 The euro zone debt crisis that has gripped the globe has
hammered the euro and caused investors to shun risky assets,
supporting the yen, which in recent years has been a favoured
cheap funding currency.
 The yen has soared by almost 10 percent against the
crumbling euro in the last month. However, cross rates
calculated by Reuters shows the yen gradually depreciating
against the euro as well.
 Euro/yen will remain around present levels at 113.9 in six
months, climbing to 115.6 in a year's time.
 ""While risk sentiment should rebound further in our view its
recovery should be more protracted so that the yen depreciation
should be more gradual than previously anticipated,"" said
Valentin Marinov, currency strategist with Societe Generale.
 In May the yen was the most volatile among the three major
currencies. Yen volatility, which hit a one-year high of 18.7
percent annualised rate last month, was seen at a rate of 11.9
percent in June based on calculations by Reuters.
 Japan's cloudy political scene could also temporarily weaken
the yen. But Yukio Hatoyama's resignation has had little impact
on equity and currency markets in a country that has now had
four prime ministers in the last three years.
 
 EURO/SWISS ADRIFT
 The Swiss franc will see moderate to negligible appreciation
against the euro in the twelve month forecast horizon, according
to survey's calculated cross rates.
 The medians of the poll saw the franc stay close to the 1.40
per euro level before breaking it to strengthen slightly to 1.39
in six months and back to 1.4 in a year.
 The Swiss National Bank has pumped in tens of billions of
Swiss francs through direct intervention in currency markets to
keep the currency from rallying in the face of a sliding euro. 
 ""SNB is up against strong forces - strong domestic data and
a weak euro - fighting the downward pressure on EUR/CHF. A drop
below 1.40 looks in the cards if the SNB does not step in once
again,"" said Christensen at Nordea.

 * 1-in-5 chance of euro/dollar parity by year-end
 * Sterling seen gaining more ground versus euro
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - The euro's brutal depreciation
against the dollar shows little sign of abating over the next 12
months, according to a monthly Reuters poll of analysts who
again took a cleaver to their forecasts.
 Median predictions from the survey of more than 50 foreign
exchange strategists showed the euro zone currency hitting
$1.175 in a year's time, a depth last plumbed in December 2005.
 The euro edged up above $1.22 on Thursday as a strong
rebound in stock markets lent support to higher yielding
currencies, but long-term sentiment towards the pan-European
currency remains unmistakably bearish.
 Punished by a crisis of confidence in markets over the euro
zone's fiscal health, the euro shed over 7 percent against the
dollar in May -- a performance so dreadful that no analyst in
last month's poll came close to predicting it.
 Respondents in the latest poll lopped at least 10 cents off
each of their one-, three-, six- and twelve-month forecasts
against the dollar, medians showed, making the sixth straight
month of downgrades to the euro's outlook.
 Still, a smaller sample gave just a one-in-five chance of
the euro reaching parity with the dollar this year, and almost
nobody thought European Central Bank would intervene directly in
the currency market to prop up its currency this year.
 ""The evolution of the crisis has not only been a near-term
negative for the euro, but signals poorly for its medium and
longer-term future,"" said Meng Jiao of Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch.
 He added that the ""disjointed"" policymaking of the last
month, which saw Germany introducing a ban on certain types of
short-selling without consulting its euro zone peers, was also a
bad sign for the euro.
 The ECB's announcement that it would start buying euro zone
government bonds to support ravaged markets came under fire in a
May 21 poll of economists, who said it damaged the bank's
credibility.
 The central bank had long ruled out such a policy and its
president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said only days before the May 10
announcement that it had not been discussed as an option at that
month's policy meeting.
 
 UNSTUCK AGAINST STERLING
 Against sterling, itself seen as something of a basket case
currency among G7 peers, forecasters again predicted steeper
losses for the euro.
 They sliced at least 3 pence off each one-, three-, six- and
twelve month forecasts, leaving the euro trading at 83.3 pence
in three months, 82.3 in six months and 81.3 in a year's time.
The euro was trading at around 83.5 pence on Thursday.
 ""(UK) government policies should support sterling over the
medium to longer term. EUR/GBP should continue to benefit from
broad-based weakness in the euro going forward,"" said Alexandre
Dolci at Societe Generale.
 Only against the yen is the euro seen strengthening against
a major currency.
 Analysts expected the euro to head slightly higher to 115.6
yen in 12 months' time from its current level around 113.5,
helped by a Japanese monetary policy that is expected to remain
ultra-loose for the foreseeable future.
 The euro should be less volatile against the dollar in June
after a tumultuous May that no-one in last month's poll saw
coming, according to calculations derived from the standard
deviation of forecasts in the survey.
 The poll implied annualised volatility easing to 13.1
percent in June from actual volatility of 17.7 percent seen in
May, the highest since January 2009.
 Although reduced, 13.1 percent represents a hefty dose of
uncertainty and comments about the euro were uniformly downbeat.
 ""While the fiscal woes in Southern Europe continue to weigh
heavily on the single currency, spare dollar liquidity and
higher USD libor rates add more downward pressure on EUR/USD,""
said Niels Christensen at Nordea.
 ""Most speculative accounts regard bounces in EUR/USD as
selling opportunities.""

 * Dogged by range of problems, Merkel's authority at stake
 
 By Madeline Chambers
 BERLIN, June 3 (Reuters) - Germany's Angela Merkel has hit a
low point in her chancellorship, and her decisions in the coming
days on tackling the budget deficit and who to back as president
may determine whether she bounces back or is politically doomed.
 Beset by a slump in popularity and a drubbing in a state
election last month, and accused at home and abroad of weak
leadership in the euro zone debt crisis, Merkel has also seen
two high profile allies quit unexpectedly within a week.
 This weekend, however, she has the opportunity to turn
things around.
 On Sunday and Monday she meets cabinet ministers to thrash
out how to cut the bulging budget deficit, and she is also about
to decide on a candidate for president after incumbent Horst
Koehler's shock resignation this week.
 ""Merkel is standing on the edge of an abyss. But she has a
chance to step back from it if she takes the right decisions in
the next few days,"" said Nils Diederich, a politics professor at
Berlin's Free University. He put her chances of success at about
50-50.
 A poll this week put support for Merkel's conservatives on
30 percent, their lowest in nearly four years, and support for
her Free Democrat (FDP) coalition partners has roughly halved
since September's election.
 A plethora of problems has made her look vulnerable and
given ammunition to rivals and even some in her own party who
accuse her of weak leadership during times of crisis.
 ""Quite simply, the chancellor is in a crap position,"" a
Merkel aide told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily, while Bavarian
health minister Markus Soeder said she was facing ""days of
reckoning"".
 
 BUDGET CRUNCH
 Most crucial will be how she tackles the state finances.
 Although the budget deficit in Europe's biggest economy
won't be as large as those in many euro zone states this year,
the government expects it to top five percent of gross domestic
product -- significantly above the EU cap of three percent. 
 Merkel and her hard-nosed Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble have already disappointed many voters -- and their FDP
partners -- by scrapping planned tax cuts for 2011 and 2012.
 They have warned of tough times ahead and say savings and
spending cuts are the order of the day. They are bound by law to
cut the structural deficit by 10 billion euros and the June 6-7
talks will agree the basis of the government's 2011 budget.
 ""The euro zone crisis has made voters worry about jobs and
inflation and they are irritated Merkel has given little sense
of direction. This makes the weekend meeting on budget cuts
pretty crucial,"" Manfred Guellner, who heads polling group
Forsa, told Reuters.
 For economists and voters alike, the key question will be
whether the government backs spending cuts or tax increases --
or opts for a combination of the two.
 Possible increases in value-added tax and tobacco duty could
fuel criticism that Merkel is endangering a fragile economic
recovery and experts say she must persuade her ministers to
slash spending.
 ""Merkel needs an austerity drive. If ministers agree to
budget discipline without tax hikes, she could present it as a
breakthrough and her position could stabilise,"" said Diederich.
 He said it was unclear whether she would win the necessary
backing of ministers from the FDP and Bavarian Christian Social
Union (CSU) who did not want to look to be bowing to pressure.
 Some analysts say that, to regain the initiative, Merkel
needs a flagship policy comparable with former Social Democrat
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's ""Agenda 2010"" labour market
reform which defined his second term.
 But Merkel is aware of the risks inherent in an austerity
package. The deeply unpopular Agenda 2010 helped the economy by
cutting welfare costs but also heralded Schroeder's downfall.
 Merkel biographer Gerd Langguth said the cautious chancellor
may try to play down her package to avoid scaring off voters.
""Merkel is pragmatic and unideological. I doubt she will use an
ideological headline to sell her policy,"" he said.
 
 MOUNTAIN OF PROBLEMS
 Another urgent question for Merkel is who she can get to
succeed Koehler as president after his shock resignation.
 Critics view his departure as a defeat for Merkel. They say
she failed to back Koehler when he came under fire over comments
he made about the army, even though he was her own candidate for
president in 2004.
 Merkel said she tried to persuade Koehler to stay and
Spiegel Online reported that she warned him that resigning could
trigger a crisis, and even shake public faith in state
institutions.
 His resignation, coupled with last week's exit from politics
of Hesse state premier Roland Koch, a prominent ally who leaves
a gap on the right of the conservative camp, has given the
impression of rats abandoning a sinking ship, say commentators.
 Merkel has been left scrambling to find a successor who will
be elected by a special parliamentary assembly on June 30.
 She may well get her choice -- whoever it ends up being --
through the assembly, where her coalition has a majority, but
any hiccup would undermine her further.
 Compounding her troubles is the need to persuade opposition
parties to back her policies in the Bundesrat upper house as her
centre-right coalition lost its majority there after a vote in
the state of North Rhine-Westphalia last month.
 The 2011 budget has to get through the Bundesrat, as do
plans to extend the lives of some nuclear power stations.
 Commentators say now is Merkel's chance to prove she is more
than a fair weather chancellor. In her trademark matter-of-fact
style, she has dismissed suggestions she isn't up to the task.
 ""You grow according to the challenges you are confronted
with,"" Merkel told a television interviewer this week.
 She has little option but to do just that.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2010 08:11AM ET</span>",Airline finances improve in 1st qtr except in Europe," * Asia-Pacific, Latin American airlines back in net profit
 * Most except Europeans show operating profit too
 
 GENEVA, June 3 (Reuters) - Airline finances rebounded
strongly in the first quarter of this year, as a strong increase
in cargo and passenger demand far outweighed extra capacity from
new planes, the industry association IATA said on Thursday.
 The recovery in airline performance seems to have resumed in
May after disruption to flights from the volcanic ash cloud
emanating from Iceland and economic concerns hit share prices,
particularly for European carriers, the International Air
Transport Association said in its airlines financial monitor.
 A sample of 50 of IATA's 230 member airlines saw net
post-tax losses halve to $2.0 billion in the first quarter of
this year from $4.1 billion a year earlier, while operating
losses shrank to $447 million from $2.9 billion.
 Strong improvements were recorded in all regions except
Europe, where net losses deepened, with airlines in the sample
from Latin America and the Asia-Pacific moving back into net
profit reflecting stronger economic recovery in those areas.
 IATA noted that first-quarter financial results are always
weak for seasonal reasons, and airlines typically make 80
percent of their earnings in the second and third quarters.
 ""This year there were signs of a significant improvement in
all regions at the operating level, though Europe stands out as
the weakest performer -- even before the impact of the ash
plume,"" IATA said.
 It said there was little reason for jet kerosene prices to
break out of the $80-100 per barrel range they have held for the
past six months, as ample inventories were likely to outweigh
the impact of any resurgence in economic optimism.
 Prices fell back during May as the Greek sovereign debt
crisis raised uncertainties about the strength of the recovery.
 The pace of improvement in passenger load factors -- a
measure of capacity usage -- slowed in March and April but it
remains near records when seasonally adjusted. However further
capacity utilisation gains will be hard over the rest of the
year as a further 1,340 aircraft are delivered, it said.
 But higher load factors for both passengers and freight are
allowing fares to rise, with premium fares now rising by about
10 percent a year and economy fares at half that, indicating
stronger market conditions.
 IATA forecast in March that the industry would lose $2.8
billion this year after $9.4 billion in 2009, with the crisis
taking accumulated losses over the past 10 years to $50 billion.

 IATA, whose members include British Airways, Lufthansa and
Singapore Airlines, will unveil a revised forecast on June 6 at
an air transport conference in Berlin.

 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Sterling edged higher against the
dollar and the euro on Thursday, helped by a survey showing a
rise in UK house prices, while a rebound in equities broadly
lifted currencies seen as higher-risk, including sterling.
 Gains were limited, however, as a poll showed activity in
the UK services sector grinding higher in May, but also revealed
a sharp drop in new business and a fall in hiring.
 This took the shine off earlier data from Nationwide showing
house prices in Britain rose by 0.5 percent in May, half the
rate of the previous two months but enough to lift property
values within 10 percent of their 2007 peak.
 Sterling rose against the dollar and the low-yielding yen in
tandem with gains in other higher risk currencies such as the
Australian dollar, as equities rose on growing hopes the global
economy is improving.
 ""It's a 'risk-on' day, with commodity currencies bid and the
dollar coming off, which is helping sterling, but it seems the
PMI data might have knocked the steam out of it a bit,"" said
Chris Turner, currency strategist at ING.
 At 1131 GMT, sterling was up 0.1 percent against the dollar
at $1.4659, off a high for the day of $1.4744. 
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to 83.48 pence though it stayed
shy of an 18-month low of 82.80 pence hit on Wednesday.
 ""Now that the single currency has closed below the 84.00
pence level, which had supported it until recently, ... further
euro losses continue to look likely,"" Michael Hewson, analyst at
CMC Markets said in a note to clients.
 He added that further losses could see it fall towards 81.70
pence, the 50 percent retracement of the euro's move up from the
2007 lows just above 65 pence to the 2008 highs around 98 pence.
 Although concerns remain about the UK, particularly its high
debt levels, sterling has gained around 5 percent since the euro
peaked just above 88 pence in early May as investors consider
the UK economy will probably fare better than the euro zone's.
 
 EQUITY BOOST
 Sterling was helped by a 1.6 percent rise in UK shares as
investors looked ahead to the release of key U.S. jobs data on
Friday. A Reuters poll shows 513,000 jobs were created in May.
 Some economists are anticipating an even stronger figure,

President Barack Obama also added to optimism, saying on

 Equity gains pressured the low-yielding yen in particular as
investors sought riskier assets, helping push sterling to a
three-week high against the Japanese currency of 136.43 yen.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - The yen fell against its major
rivals on Thursday amid renewed appetite for risk in global
markets, with political uncertainty in Japan also weighing on
the currency.
 Speculation that there would be a strong reading of U.S.
jobs data due on Friday prompted demand for riskier currencies,
pushing the Australian and New Zealand dollars higher. Investors
tend to sell the low-yielding yen to fund such investments.
 ""Financial market conditions have stabilised in the
near-term. There's renewed risk-taking and that leads to a
weaker yen,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 At 1115 GMT, the dollar was trading with gains of around 0.5
percent versus the yen at 92.65 yen. The euro also held gains of
around 0.5 percent versus the Japanese currency at 113.50 yen
having earlier rallied above 114.00. 
 Stock markets around the world have been stabilising after
deep losses last month on concerns about Greece's debt woes.
 European shares rose 1.8 percent, pulling further away from
a nine-month low hit last week.
 ""Equity markets are looking better today,"" said Marcus
Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit Suisse in
Zurich. ""At least for today, we're seeing some stabilisation in
risk appetite.""
 Traders also took speculation that Japan's next prime
minister would take a tougher stance in fighting the yen's
strength as an opportunity to trim long positions in the
currency.
 Finance minister and candidate for ruling party head -- and
hence the premiership -- Naoto Kan surprised markets earlier
this year by saying that he wanted the yen to weaken more and
that most businesses were in favour of a dollar/yen rate around
95 yen.
 ""Political uncertainty in Japan is also weighing on the yen
in the short-term,"" added BTM-UFJ's Hardman.
 The euro traded close to flat versus the dollar at $1.2250,
slipping from day's high of $1.2326 as traders said option
expiries at $1.2300 and $1.2200 were set to contain price action
into the 1400GMT New York expiry time.
 The single currency has found its footing after sliding as
low as $1.2110 on Tuesday, its weakest in more than four years.
The Australian dollar rallied 0.8 percent versus the U.S.
dollar to $0.8478. with the New Zealand dollar gaining around
0.5 percent against the greenback at $0.6850.
 The dollar was also trading close to unchanged versus a
basket of currencies at 86.776.

 PAYROLLS EXPECTATIONS
 Investors took heart from U.S. data on Wednesday, which
showed surprisingly strong pending home sales for April and a
jump in May auto sales.
 Expectations of a strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday also
helped to whet the market's appetite for riskier assets. A
Reuters poll shows 513,000 jobs were created in May.

 Some economists are anticipating an even stronger figure,
with BNP Paribas upgrading its forecast to +615,000, while U.S.
President Barack Obama also added to optimism, saying on
Wednesday the report would show strong growth
 But given such lofty expectations, analysts at Paribas said
caution would be required going into the data given the heavy

 ""The market may be setting itself up for some near-term

bullish on the labour market report with a 'buy the rumour sell

 * Could damage productivity, hamper trade and growth
 * Subsidies push up labour costs, weigh on budget
 
 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, June 3 (Reuters) - German subsidies to prop up
employment by reducing working hours have helped bring about a
""job miracle"", but it may prove a mirage if they prevent
necessary structural changes and hamper competitiveness.
 Firms in Europe's largest economy have shed surprisingly few
jobs in the global crisis, thanks in substantial part to state
spending to encourage ""Kurzarbeit"" -- shorter hours.
 But a number of economists are criticising the government's
decision to extend the Kurzarbeit scheme to March 2012, arguing
it is redundant in a recovery, creates false incentives for
companies to retain workers and raises labour costs.
 If the country does not wind down the stimulus measures in
good time, it could damage productivity, eating into Germany's
share of global trade and stunt growth.
 ""Kurzarbeit costs companies money, it costs the state money
and productivity has fallen,"" said Joachim Scheide, chief
economist of the Kiel-based IfW economic think tank.
 ""Over the mid-term it risks hindering structural changes at
firms and preventing natural staff fluctuations -- which could
hold back growth. How much it would cost is very hard to say.""
 Germany exited its deepest post-war recession in the second
quarter of 2009 and recent economic indicators have beaten
forecasts, with industrial output and orders surging in March
while exports rose at their fastest rate in nearly 18 years.
 The strength of the country's industrial competitiveness has
caused friction with key trading partners like France, who argue
German wage restraint has depressed demand at home, curbing
appetite for foreign goods and reducing potential for growth.
 Widespread use of reduced hours could help offset this if
the scheme leads to a lasting increase in labour costs. But it
could also damage German competitiveness.
 
 MASKING PROBLEMS
 Unemployment fell for the eleventh month running in May and
was kept in check throughout the crisis, prompting Economics
Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman to call it a ""jobs miracle"".
 Many firms, especially in export-oriented industries such as
the engineering sector, avoided mass lay-offs by exploiting the
unique legal provision of Kurzarbeit, whose origins go back to
1910 but which has been heavily ramped up during the crisis.
 However, the DIW economic think tank pointed out in a recent
research paper that even sectors hardly affected by the economic
turmoil were drawing on the Kurzarbeit scheme.
 In the meantime, others continued to opt for reduced working
hours although they were unlikely to achieve capacity levels
again that would warrant holding onto all their workers.
 ""Some sectors that were little impacted by the crisis are
perhaps drawing on the Kurzarbeit scheme because of operational
difficulties or structural problems,"" the DIW wrote.
 Jobless data look less impressive in this light, as critics
say they fail to include some long-term Kurzarbeit workers for
whom subsidies have become an ersatz unemployment benefit.
 The DIW said three quarters of all workers on Kurzarbeit had
been benefiting from it for longer than six months in December,
while 85,000 had been drawing on it for longer than a year.
 ""Around summer 2008, there was a real surge in
registrations, so two years later -- when those subsidies expire
-- there is a big risk unemployment will pick up,"" said Jennifer
McKeown, an analyst at Capital Economics.
 Instead of supporting jobs in structurally weak sectors such
as the car industry, the government should promote job creation
in sectors with more potential such as healthcare and research
and development, said Carsten Brzeski at ING Financial Markets.
 ""It doesn't need a lot now to redirect the job market and
make this success story last for a while,"" he said.
 
 EXPENSIVE SCHEME
 Furthermore, Kurzarbeit is partly to blame for the sharpest
rise in hourly labour costs in Germany in over a decade last
year, according to the Federal Statistics Office, as cuts in pay
were less than proportionate to reductions in working hours.
 The rise far outpaced the euro zone average. [ID:nLDE62T0WN]
 ""We need to be careful that we do not perpetuate the one-off
rise in unit labour costs but get them back in check over the
next few years,"" said Holger Schaefer, a labour market expert at
the Institute for Economic Research of Cologne.
 ""Unit costs should decrease with increasing labour demand at
firms, resulting in smaller working time reductions, but if not
we could have problems with competitiveness,"" he said.
 Much of the financial burden of Kurzarbeit has been taken on
by the government rather than by firms themselves. The scheme
cost the Labour Office 4.6 billion euros in 2009.
 Previously, companies had to shoulder all social security
contributions of workers on shorter hours, but under new laws
introduced in the crisis the Labour Office pays 50 percent of
this for the first six months, and 100 percent thereafter.
 Kurzarbeit is thus a major burden on the budget, at a time
when consolidation is a major concern. This is offset in part by
the fact the state has to dole out fewer jobless benefits.
 However, analysts say the dangers harboured by Kurzarbeit
are receding as the German recovery gains traction.
 The number of workers on Kurzarbeit declined to around
830,000 in March from its peak of more than 1.5 million in May
2009 and could fall further as production picks up.
 ING's Brzeski said Germany still had to be careful. ""The
government should not be complacent and overstretch a success
story,"" he said.

 * Companies holding U.S. dollar debt repay less in yuan
terms
 * Stronger Chinese spending offsets higher operating costs
 * Operating costs are less than 5 pct of expenditure - UBS
 By Kelvin Soh
 TAIPEI, June 3 (Reuters) - Asia's legion of technology
exporters may not struggle, as some predict, if China allows
its currency to appreciate.
 A stronger yuan would rather boost consumer spending power
and increase the value of Chinese assets.
The conceived wisdom has been that the Taiwanese, Singaporean
and other makers who piece together most of world's popular
gadgets in Chinese factories will be hurt by a stronger yuan,
which would raise operating costs and squeeze margins that are
often already in the low single digits.
 However, most manufacturers survived a 19 percent rise in
the yuan between 2005-08 and use hedging tools and dollar
borrowing to mitigate risk.
 Patrick Bennett, strategist at Standard Bank in Hong Kong,
doesn't see a yuan rise as a total game-changer.
 ""You're giving the Chinese consumer more spending power,
and most of these tech exporters have foreign exchange tools to
deal with any appreciation,"" he said.
 China has been under pressure from major trading partners
such as the United States to allow a more flexible yuan, and
many economists expect the currency to be revalued by 3-5
percent by the year-end.
 Many of Asia's tech exporters including Hon Hai Precision
Industry Co Ltd, Flextronics International Ltd and Quanta
Computer Inc run huge facilities in China, making and
assembling electronics gadgets for leading brands such as
Hewlett-Packard Co and Apple Inc, freeing them up to
concentrate on marketing and development.
 Most tech firms spend their yuan on wages and related
costs, but these make up less than 5 percent of a PC maker's
overall costs, UBS analyst Edward Yen said recently.
 ""It's not going to have much of an effect,"" Gary Lu, chief
financial officer at Compal Electronics Inc, the world's No.1
contract laptop PC maker, said at the Computex computer show.
 ""We bill and source for everything in U.S. dollars, so
besides some very local costs such as wages, we won't see a
hike in actual costs.""
 Many companies also have assets in China such as production
facilities and yuan cash holdings, which would be worth more
with any local currency appreciation.
 Foxconn International Holdings Ltd, the world's largest
contract mobile phone maker, had more than $1.7 billion worth
of property and equipment in China at the end of last year.
 ""Many of these companies already have a natural hedge, and
some might even come out in a net positive position if the yuan
appreciates,"" said Jenny Lai, a Taipei-based analyst with CLSA.
 ""They also have large cash holdings in yuan sitting in
Chinese bank accounts, and any subsequent hike in costs from a
currency revaluation will be offset by all that cash.""
 Beijing has said it wants to promote private consumption to
re-orient its economy away from a model that relies heavily on
foreign investment and exports -- and a currency revaluation
would fit into this policy.
 ""Chinese consumption is still a big growth story,"" said
Bonnie Chang, an analyst at Yuanta Securities. ""A stronger yuan
will have consumers spending more, which will be good for
business.""
 Twelve-month yuan NDFs were trading at 6.75 yuan to the
U.S. dollar on Thursday, implying that investors expect the
currency to appreciate about 2 percent over current levels.
 Another defence that companies have up their sleeve is
borrowing in dollars. The amount they would have to repay in
yuan terms would fall if the Chinese currency appreciates.
 The world's top webcam and keyboard manufacturer, Chicony
Electronics Co Ltd, had more than $100 million in
dollar-denominated debt at the end of its last reporting
quarter, said its chief financial officer, Molly Lin.
 ""Everyone already knows it's going to happen, so we've
already made plans and may even come out positive,"" Lin said.
""When the yuan was still weak, we used it to borrow lots of
U.S. dollars so that we repay less when it appreciates.""
 A bigger worry could be copycat appreciations by smaller
economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea as they try
to make imports cheaper and help domestic consumption.
 The Taiwan dollar and South Korean won both appreciated by
around a tenth in 2005-08 when China allowed its currency to
rise, while the Singapore dollar gained almost a fifth.
 ""All the Asian economies are very closely linked,"" said
Standard Bank's Bennett. ""If you have one major trading partner
moving on its currency, the rest are not going to be sitting
around watching.""

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - The dollar fell across the board
on Thursday as a rise in share markets on the back of strong
U.S. economic data helped to cool extreme risk aversion.
 The yen suffered against its major rivals as the Japanese
currency, which is perceived to be low risk due to its low
yield, also took a hit from improving risk appetite.
 Speculation that there would be a strong reading of U.S.
jobs data due on Friday prompted demand for riskier currencies,
pushing the Australian and New Zealand dollars higher and
supporting even the euro, which has been plagued by euro zone
debt problems.
 ""Equity markets are looking better today,"" said Marcus
Hettinger, global currency strategist at Credit Suisse in
Zurich. ""At least for today, we're seeing some stabilisation in
risk appetite.""
 Stock markets around the world have been stabilising after
deep losses last month on concerns about Greece's debt woes.
 European shares <.FTEU3> rose roughly 2 percent, pulling
further away from a nine-month low hit last week.
 Investors took heart from U.S. data released on Wednesday,
which showed surprisingly strong pending home sales for April
and a jump in May auto sales. [ID:nN02180660]
 By 0936 GMT, the euro traded 0.3 percent higher on the day
at $1.2285, near the day's high of $1.2326. The single currency
has found its footing after sliding as low as $1.2110 on
Tuesday, its weakest in more than four years.
Gains in the euro and other currencies, including the
Australian dollar  and the New Zealand dollar ,
which each rallied 1 percent versus their U.S. counterpart,
pushed the U.S. dollar index <.DXY> down 0.3 percent to 86.555.
 Despite its broad losses, the dollar  edged up 0.5
percent to 92.79 yen, its strongest in roughly two weeks. The
yen came under general selling pressure, helping to push the
euro 1 percent higher to 114.17 yen.
 In addition to risk demand, traders also took speculation
that Japan's next prime minister would take a tougher stance in
fighting the yen's strength as an opportunity to trim long
positions in the yen, market participants said. [ID:nTOE65100Q]
 
 PAYROLLS EXPECTATIONS
 Expectations of a strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday also
helped to whet the market's appetite for riskier assets. A
Reuters poll shows 513,000 jobs were created in May.
[ID:nN02176933]
 Some economists are anticipating an even stronger figure,
with BNP Paribas upgrading its forecast to +615,000, while U.S.
President Barack Obama also added to optimism, saying on
Wednesday the report would show strong growth [ID:nN02175839]
 But given such lofty expectations, analysts at Paribas said
caution would be required going into the data given the heavy
bullish positioning.
 ""The market may be setting itself up for some near-term
volatility with the risk that investors are becoming overly
bullish on the labour market report with a 'buy the rumour sell
the fact' scenario appearing to build,"" they said in a note.
 A trimming of some extreme short positions in the euro has
helped to stabilise the currency, but some analysts warn its
downtrend remains intact, and that it would remain vulnerable to
any signs that more euro zone nations are struggling from
deficit and banking problems.
 Euro/dollar implied volatility was at around 15.5 percent
, retreating from a 14-month high of 19 percent hit in
late May, when escalating risk aversion prompted volatile trade.
 But even as markets have calmed since then, overall euro
sentiment remains bearish.
 One-month 25 delta risk reversals , a
barometer for short-term fear among speculators and hedge funds,
remain bid for more euro downside, trading at 2.85 on Thursday.

 By Alan Wheatley, China Economics Editor
 BUSAN, South Korea, June 3 (Reuters) - Disagreements over how
quickly to reduce billowing budget deficits and restore balance
to the global economy risk straining high-level Group of 20 talks
that started on Thursday.
 A plunge in the euro and in global stock markets, triggered
by fears that Greece's debt woes could spread to other euro zone
countries, has added urgency to the meetings of G20 finance
ministers and central bankers in this southern port city.
 With officials ruling out agreement in Busan on key financial
and regulatory reforms, including a mooted global bank levy, the
need to strike the right balance between trimming deficits and
sustaining economic growth will take centre stage. ""Countries
with high budget deficits need to make sure they can deal with
those deficits,"" Britain's finance minister, George Osborne, said
in Beijing before flying to Busan.
 ""Surplus countries also need to play their part contributing
to global growth and that will be one of the big topics for
discussion in South Korea,"" he said.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the need to get
the balance right was a ""shared imperative"" recognised by all G20
members.
 ""As the IMF says, we want those fiscal reforms to happen in a
way that's growth-friendly,"" Geithner told reporters in
Washington on Wednesday. ""Some countries are in a very strong
position. Some countries need to move much more quickly.""
 Another G20 official put the need for coordinated fiscal
tightening more graphically: the euro zone crisis had shown that
some countries would have to withdraw stimulus earlier than
expected, but not everyone should run to the other side of the
boat at the same time, the official said.
 EXIT STRATEGIES
 G20 nations to date have merely discussed the timing of
unwinding the super-loose monetary and fiscal policies they
launched to cushion the crisis, but the Bank of Canada on Tuesday
became the first G7 nation to raise its key interest rate.
 ""I would think we are coming to a time where we could move
forward with the implementation of exit strategies,"" Canadian
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in Beijing on the way to
Busan.
 Deputy ministers were holding preparatory talks on Thursday,
a day ahead of the start of the main meeting, which is itself
clearing the ground for a June 26-27 G20 summit in Toronto.
 Putting down a firm marker, Flaherty restated Canada's firm
opposition to the idea of a bank levy to pay for any other
financial bailout.
 Flaherty said G20 countries needed to ""keep our eye on the
ball"" in reforming the financial sector, focus on capital
requirements and steer clear of a global bank levy.
 He said he had written to his G20 counterparts last week
detailing Canada's proposal of ""embedded contingent capital"" to
shore up banks' balance sheets as an alternative to a global tax.
 The G20, the premier international economic policy
coordination forum, brings together the world's systemically
important rich economies and emerging markets. Together they
account for 85 percent of global output.
 Anxious to soothe global markets, the group is expected to
back the euro zone's deficit-cutting strategy, even though China
and Brazil fret that the bloc has not acted more decisively.
 ""The euro zone crisis is of great concern and I think I'm not
saying too much when I say it came up in the meetings I've had
here. There's clearly a lot of Chinese concern about the euro
zone,"" Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said after
talks with Vice Premier Wang Qishan.
 REBALANCING
 However, differences of emphasis on how fast to plug the hole
in public finances are close to the surface within the euro zone
itself.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde brushed off concern
in some G20 capitals that Germany is preparing fresh
belt-tightening even though its deficit, while above 5 percent of
GDP, is modest by European standards.
 Speaking to reporters in Paris on Wednesday, Lagarde said
removal of the economic stimulus that governments put in place to
combat recession was all a matter of ""fine-tuning"".
 But she added: ""We need to be careful to avoid brutal
shifts.""
 Fiscally conservative Germany, the largest euro zone economy,
is considering raising value-added tax to the full rate of 19
percent on certain items that now benefit from a lower rate of 7
percent, according to sources in the coalition government.
 Beyond fire-fighting on the deficit front, ministers will
discuss the medium-term growth framework -- or how to iron out
economic imbalances that were a root cause of the 2008-2009
global financial crisis.
 Officials said that Canada, the current G20 president, hopes
to secure agreement in Toronto on the broad suite of policies
needed to reduce these imbalances.
 Individual countries would then commit themselves to specific
policies at the next G20 summit in Seoul in November.

he would run for the party leadership to replace Prime Minister

 The Democrats will vote on Friday to pick a new leader, and
hence the prime minister. Tarutoko will face Finance Minister
Naoto Kan, who is seen as the front-runner to succeed Hatoyama,
who resigned on Wednesday after just eight months in office.
 Following are some facts about Tarutoko.
 -- Tarutoko, 50, heads the lower house environment committee.
In a survey by the Mainichi newspaper ahead of last year's
general election, Tarutoko backed the party line that a decision
on raising the consumption tax from the current 5 percent should
wait until after the next general election, due by late 2013. He
also said he did not rate former Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi's structural reforms very highly. But not much is known
about his recent views on economic policy.
 -- He is one of seven members of a group led by party elder
Kozo Watanabe that has distanced itself from party heavyweight
Ichiro Ozawa, who is widely seen as pulling the strings behind
Hatoyama's government. But he is also reported to be close to
pro-Ozawa lawmakers.
 -- In the Mainichi survey, Tarutoko said he was for revising
the pacifist Article Nine of Japan's 1947 U.S.-drafted
constitution but also said Japan should never consider arming
with nuclear weapons.
 -- After graduating from the economics department of Osaka
University, Tarutoko went to a school for political leaders that
embraces free-market economic policies, called the Matsushita
Institute of Government and Management, which boasts 70
politicians among its alumni including some cabinet members.

 By Ian Chua
 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Global stocks powered to a
two-week high on Thursday while the yen came under pressure
after recent upbeat U.S. data renewed appetite for riskier and
higher-yielding assets.
 Wall Street looked set to benefit, with U.S. stock index
futures all in the black, pointing to an extension of the
previous day's gains.
 Investors welcomed data on Wednesday that showed pending
home sales rose to a six-month high in April. Expectations are
high that numbers due on Friday will show the U.S. economy
generated more than 500,000 jobs last month.
 ""Yesterday's news on U.S. pending home sales and auto sales
are signs confidence is improving in the economy,"" said David
Buik, partner at BGC Partners. ""We are also expecting decent
U.S. non-farm payroll numbers tomorrow which is quite key."" 
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI climbed 1.2 percent,
having earlier reached highs last seen on May 19, and emerging
markets stocks rallied 2 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares put on 1.8
percent, with financial shares such as Banco Santander and
Barclays among the bright spots.
 Energy stocks ended a four-day losing run, with BP, which
had been battered by the Gulf of Mexico disaster, rising 3.3
percent.
 Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei share average rose over 3 percent,
posting its biggest one-day rise in six months.
 
 YEN PRESSURED
 But the yen, already on a shaky footing with political
uncertainty in Japan weighing, fell across the board.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent versus the yen to 92.69 and the
euro gained 0.5 percent to 113.46.
 ""Financial market conditions have stabilised in the near
term. There's renewed risk-taking and that leads to a weaker
yen,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at BTM-UFJ.
 Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was flat,
having recovered from an earlier fall.
 The New Zealand dollar, which hit a two-week high at $0.69,
was last at $0.6848.
 Government bond yields rose as appetite for safe-haven
assets weakened. The 10-year German Bund yield climbed 6 basis
points to 2.719 percent, while the 10-year U.S. yield put on 3
bps to 3.380 percent.
 Gold fell, but U.S. crude oil futures rose $0.37 to $73.24 a
barrel and copper erased earlier gains to be down 0.4 percent at
$6,665.00 a tonne.

(Adds comments on China's handling of crisis, future plans)
 By Emma Graham-Harrison
 BEIJING, June 3 (Reuters) - China's yuan currency should be
looked at as part of a wider set of imbalances in the global
economy, which will be discussed at this week's G20 meeting,
British finance minister George Osborne said on Thursday.
 China came under renewed pressure to let the yuan
appreciate on Wednesday when a letter obtained by Reuters
showed the United States government was considering
investigating whether its strict currency policy created an
illegal trade subsidy.
 The Asian powerhouse has said it is committed to currency
reform, but at its own pace, and argues that the stability of
its currency contributed to the world's recovery from the
financial crisis.
 ""The currency needs to be seen in the broader context of
the broader imbalances in the world,"" Osborne said when asked
about the yuan during a trip to China before the June 4-5
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Korea.
 ""Countries with high budget deficits need to make sure they
can deal with those deficits. Surplus countries also need to
play their part contributing to global growth and that will be
one of the big topics for discussion in South Korea.""
 Osborne's comments are his first on the explosive topic
since the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition took office
in May.
 They may cheer emerging market economies, which are
concerned that the onus for adjustment of global imbalances
will fall unfairly on them. Brazilian finance minister Guido
Mantega recently blamed a weak dollar and low U.S. interest
rates -- not an undervalued yuan -- for many of the world's
woes.
 Western nations, eager to rebalance their economies
following the financial crisis, argue China's foreign exchange
policy gives it an unfair advantage in global trade. Many
economists believe the yuan  is undervalued by about
20 percent.
 But Osborne said China had managed its economy well during
recent global turmoil and he hoped it was readying to take on a
larger world leadership role in financial and political
affairs.
 ""If you look back over the last couple of years you could
fault many economies for what has happened, but actually China
has handled itself pretty well,"" he said at the end of his stay
in Beijing, his first trip beyond Europe in his new post.
 ""China is an absolutely key economic leader in the world
(and) I want it to play a bigger role in key economic forums
like the IMF and the G20, and indeed a bigger role in terms of
general global leadership,"" he said, referring to issues like
climate change and tensions with Iran over its nuclear
programme.
 EURO ZONE CRISIS
 Osborne, a deficit hawk, said China had raised their
concerns about the euro zone fiscal crisis with him during
meetings.
 Policymakers across Europe are tussling with how to bring
down bloated government borrowing without harming economic
recovery after the global downturn.
 Osborne said that, while immediate liquidity problems had
been addressed, questions remained over whether
heavily-indebted countries would be able to push through
necessary budget cuts.
 ""There's clearly a lot of Chinese concern about the euro
zone,"" he said. ""There are broader issues about fiscal
sustainability, about the ability of high deficit countries in
the euro zone to tackle those problems.""
 Osborne said it was in ""in everyone's interests around the
world that those countries do that,"" and added that he hoped it
would be discussed at the G20.
 Osborne, eager to introduce some form of bank levy perhaps
as soon as his first budget on June 22, said he wanted swift,
co-ordinated action from the G20 on financial reform.
 ""One of the things I'll be pushing for at the G20 is that
the agreements that were come to last year that we would
develop global standards ... are now made more concrete,"" he
said.
 ""Of course there will be a period of transition for banks
but we want to end the uncertainty about what those standards
are going to be and the sooner we can do that the better.""

 U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday said he believed
the jobs report would show strong growth.
 By 0744 GMT, the euro traded 0.3 percent higher on the day
at $1.2285, having climbed as high as $1.2326 at the start of
European trade.
 The single currency has found its footing after sliding as
low as $1.2110 on Tuesday, its weakest in more than four years.
 A trimming of some extreme short positions in the euro has
helped to stabilise the currency, but some analysts warn its
downtrend remains intact, and that it would remains vulnerable
to any signs that more euro zone nations are struggling from
deficit and banking problems.
 
 YEN SUFFERS
 Euro/dollar implied volatility was at around 15.5 percent,
retreating from a 14-month high of 19 percent hit in late May,
when escalating risk aversion prompted volatile trade.
 But even as markets have calmed since then, overall euro
sentiment remains bearish.
 One-month 25 delta risk reversals, a barometer for
short-term fear among speculators and hedge funds, remain well
bid for more euro downside, trading at 2.85 on Thursday.
Still, gains in the euro and other currencies, including the
Australian dollar which rallied 1 percent versus its U.S.
counterpart, pushed the U.S. dollar index down 0.3 percent to
86.555.
 Despite its broad losses, the dollar edged up 0.3 percent to
92.45 yen.
 The Japanese currency suffered against its major rivals as
improving risk demand decreased its perceived safe-haven appeal.
 Traders also took speculation that Japan's next prime
minister would take a tougher stance in fighting the yen's
strength as an opportunity to trim long positions in the yen,
market participants said.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan is tipped to succeed unpopular
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama who said on Wednesday he was
resigning.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses favoured a
dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. But since then he has mostly toed
the ministry line that stable currencies are desirable and
markets should set foreign exchange levels.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2010 04:03AM ET</span>",Euro zone services expands apace despite debt woes," * Euro zone services PMI hits 56.2 in May from 55.6 in April
 * Two-year stretch of job losses comes to an end
 * Euro zone composite PMI dips slightly
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Growing alarm about the finances
of euro zone states has yet to knock the recovery of the bloc's
dominant services sector, according to a survey which showed it
expanding in May at a pace not seen since August 2007.
 The Markit Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers' Index
covering activities from banks to restaurants also showed an end
to an almost two-year stretch of job losses among services
companies.
 The survey's headline business activity index rose to 56.2
in May from 55.6 in April, the ninth month in a row it has been
above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and
slightly higher than the 56.0 preliminary reading.
 But survey compiler Markit warned that while services
activity in France and Germany might be buoyant now, the crisis
of confidence over the euro zone's fiscal health could damage
activity in future.
 ""Inflows of new business slowed across both manufacturing
and services as the debt crisis and announcements of austerity
measures dented business and consumer confidence, increasing the
risk of slower growth in coming months,"" said Chris Williamson,
chief economist at Markit.
 Last week, French Budget Minister Francois Baroin said his
government was committed to making tough budget decisions needed
to retain its top-notch credit rating. [ID:nLDE64T0A8]
 The euro zone debt crisis gripping financial markets has
battered the euro currency, sending it to a new four-year low
against the dollar on Tuesday, and forced other members of the
currency bloc to expedite efforts to cut budgets down to size.
 The euro zone manufacturing PMI survey released on Tuesday
showed slowing expansion in euro zone factories as output growth
levelled off sharply.
 That offset Thursday's upbeat services PMI to send the
composite euro zone PMI, which combines the services and
manufacturing sectors, lower at 56.4 in May from 57.3 in April.
 Markit's Williamson said the final data, firmly in growth
territory, confirm findings from an earlier flash estimate that
euro zone GDP could expand by as much as 0.6 percent in the
second quarter.
 Median forecasts from around 40 economists in Reuters'
monthly long-term economic outlook on May 13 showed growth in
the euro zone economy not exceeding 0.5 percent in any quarter
through to the end of next year. [ECILT/EU]
 France's service sector grew at its fastest rate since
September 2006 and created jobs for the first time in two years,
a PMI report released earlier on Thursday showed.
 Surveys from periphery laggards Spain and Ireland showed
their service sectors remained in growth territory.
 ""Both Spain and Ireland have seen returns to growth in
recent months, suggesting that recovery is at last taking hold
in the region's periphery,"" said Markit's Williamson.
 Services growth slipped slightly in the euro zone's No.1
economy Germany, hindered by slower growth of new business, but
like France it enjoyed an improved jobs index.
 Helped by this, the overall euro zone services employment
index headed into positive territory for the first time since
June 2008, rising to 50.5 from 49.8 in April.
 Official unemployment in the euro zone rose to 10.1 percent
in April, its highest in nearly 12 years.

 KARACHI, June 3 (Reuters) - Pakistan's central bank
governor stepped down on Thursday citing ""personal reasons,""
two days before the announcement of the 2010/11 federal budget,
the Finance Ministry said.
 ""We don't know what the reasons are for the resignation,
but the timing of it can be worrisome,"" said Sayem Ali, an
economist at Standard Chartered Bank. ""It is right before the
budget is announced and relations with the IMF are in a bit of
a difficult stage.""
 ""There is definitely more than personal reasons to his
resignation,"" said a senior government official, requesting
anonymity. ""There were a couple of issues, and there was a
tussle going on between him and the government. I cannot
divulge on the issues, but I can say all was not well.""
 The announcement was made at 2:41 a.m. Thursday in an
e-mail from the Finance Ministry.
 ""Salim Raza, Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)
submitted his resignation from the post of Governor on 6th May
2010, citing personal reasons,"" the ministry statement said.
 It was not immediately clear why the announcement was
delayed, if he had stepped down nearly a month ago.
Earlier, a source close to Raza said the government had
accepted his resignation. ""Yes, I can confirm he has resigned
and his resignation has been accepted, but I cannot comment on
the reasons for his resignation,"" the source said.
 Raza was appointed central bank governor in December 2008.
Although he had little direct impact on the federal budget,
Pakistan's financial institutions have been under pressure from
the International Monetary Fund to make painful reforms.
 Yaseen Anwar, deputy governor of the State Bank of
Pakistan, has become acting governor, the Finance Ministry
said.
 Anwar, appointed deputy governor in March 2007, is a former
executive vice president for London's Kraken Financial Group.
 Stock brokers said Raza's resignation would have little
impact on the market and they were waiting for who the next
governor would be. Pakistan's main stock exchange index opened
0.35 percent higher at 9,532.31 points.
 ""The resignation of the SBP governor should have no
material impact on the markets especially since most policies
are coordinated with donor or multilateral agencies, leaving
little room for dynamism by individuals in formulating such
policies,"" said Asad Iqbal, chief investment officer at Faysal
Asset Management Ltd.
 Pakistan turned to the IMF in November 2008 for an
emergency package to avert a balance of payments crisis and
shore up reserves and received the fifth tranche this month
amounting to $1.13 billion of a $10.66 billion loan.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2010 12:59AM ET</span>",G20 strives to cut deficits without killing growth," * Balancing growth and deficit cuts at heart of G20 talks
 * Ministers see tough task fine-tuning clashing imperatives
 * No consensus in sight on global banking levy
 By Alan Wheatley
 BUSAN, South Korea, June 3 (Reuters) - Disagreements over how
quickly to reduce billowing budget deficits and restore balance
to the global economy risk straining high-level Group of 20 talks
starting on Thursday.
 A plunge in the euro and in global stock markets, triggered
by fears that Greece's debt woes could spread to other euro zone
countries, has added urgency to the meetings of G20 finance
ministers and central bankers in this southern port city.
 With officials ruling out agreement in Busan on key financial
and regulatory reforms, including a mooted global bank levy, the
need to strike the right balance between trimming deficits and
sustaining economic growth will take centre stage.
 ""That is a shared imperative. We all recognise it,"" U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters in Washington
on Wednesday before leaving for South Korea.
 ""As the IMF says, we want those fiscal reforms to happen in a
way that's growth-friendly,"" he added. ""Some countries are in a
very strong position. Some countries need to move much more
quickly.""
 Another G20 official put the need for coordinated fiscal
tightening more graphically: the euro zone crisis had shown that
some countries would have to withdraw stimulus earlier than
expected, but not everyone should run to the other side of the
boat at the same time said.
 Deputy ministers were holding preparatory talks on Thursday,
a day ahead of the start of the main meeting, which is itself
clearing the ground for a June 26-27 G20 summit in Toronto.
 The G20, the premier international economic policy
coordination forum, brings together the world's systemically
important rich economies and emerging markets. Together they
account for 85 percent of global output.
 NO ""BRUTAL SHIFT""
 Anxious to soothe global markets, the group is expected to
back the euro zone's deficit-cutting strategy, even though China
and Brazil have expressed concern that the bloc has not acted
more decisively.
 However, differences of emphasis, if not downright
disagreement, on how fast to plug the hole in public finances are
close to the surface within the euro zone itself.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde brushed off concern
in some G20 capitals that Germany is preparing fresh
belt-tightening even though its deficit, while above 5 percent of
GDP, is modest by European standards.
 Speaking to reporters in Paris on Wednesday, Lagarde said
removal of the economic stimulus that governments put in place to
combat recession was all a matter of ""fine-tuning"".
 But she added: ""We need to be careful to avoid brutal
shifts.""
 Fiscally conservative Germany, the largest euro zone economy,
is considering raising value-added tax to the full rate of 19
percent on certain items that now benefit from a lower rate of 7
percent, according to sources in the coalition government.
 ""If you abolish tax breaks, some will say that's a tax
increase. At the end of the day, it's about having a sensible and
balanced policy,"" Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told the
Bild am Sonntag paper last weekend.
 DIFFERENCES
 Beyond fire-fighting on the deficit front, ministers will
discuss the medium-term growth framework -- or how to iron out
economic imbalances that were a root cause of the 2008-2009
global financial crisis.
 Here, the emerging-market members of the G20 are concerned
that the onus for adjustment will fall unfairly on them,
impinging on their sovereignty in the process.
 Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega expressed this
frustration, blaming a weak dollar and low U.S. interest rates --
not an undervalued Chinese currency -- for many of the world's
economic woes.
 ""I've noticed there's a strategy by the United States and
advanced countries to increase exports and reduce their
imbalances at the cost of emerging markets,"" Mantega told Reuters
in Brasilia last month.
 ""We have to reach a compromise, otherwise the emerging
markets will seek solutions to defend their interests that will
clash with those of the Americans and Europeans,"" he said.
 Officials said that Canada, the current G20 president, hopes
it can at least secure agreement in Toronto on the broad suite of
policies needed to reduce global imbalances as the economy
recovers.
 If all goes well, individual countries would then commit
themselves to specific policies at the next G20 summit in Seoul
in November.

 * Some yen selling on view Finmin Kan to be next Japan PM
 * Euro manages to trade above $1.22, but sentiment bearish
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, June 3 (Reuters) - The yen lost ground for a second
day on Thursday, as a strong rebound in stock markets lent
support to higher-yielding currencies and even to the floundering
euro.
 Non-Japanese investors were particularly active in trimming
short positions in yen crosses before U.S. non-farm payrolls data
on Friday, which is expected to show a fifth straight month of
gains in May, market players said.
 ""Investors covered short-positions in yen crosses taking
their cue from a rally in the Nikkei and a moderate rise in U.S.
stock futures,"" said Kazuyuki Takami, senior manager for forex
exchange trading at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""Market sentiment is not so bad,"" he said, adding that a good
reading for U.S. jobs data would help to counter the long run of
negative news out of Europe.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 92.26 yen from late in New
York on Wednesday when it gained 1.2 percent to hit a two-week
high of 92.36 yen. Near term resistance is seen at 92.97 yen, a
high hit on May 18.
 The dollar found support from upbeat U.S. data, including
numbers released on Wednesday which showed pending sales of
previously owned homes topping expectations.
 But gains in the greenback during Asia trade were limited as
Japanese exporters were selling the currency above 92.00 yen,
traders said.
 There was speculation in the market that Japan's next prime
minister would take a tougher stance in fighting the yen's
strength, with investors taking this as an excuse to trim yen
long positions..
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan is tipped to succeed unpopular
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama who said on Wednesday he was
resigning.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses favoured a
dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. But since then he has mostly toed
the ministry line that stable currencies are desirable and
markets should set foreign exchange levels.
 Against the Japanese currency, the Australian dollar rose 0.5
percent to 78.08 yen after touching the day's high above 78.20
yen, breaking the 38.2 percent retracement of April's high above
88.00 and May's low of around 71.90 yen. 
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to 113.36 yen, having jumped more
than 1 percent on Wednesday. The near term resistance for the
pair is seen around last week's high at 113.67 yen.
 Japanese investors continued to pick up overseas bonds in a
bid for higher yields elsewhere as domestic bond yields remain
very low, buying a net 1.2 trillion yen ($29 billion) of overseas
bonds last week, the most since September.
 Japan's Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance told Reuters on
Wednesday it plans to boost its overseas debt holdings including
unhedged foreign bonds by 75 billion in the year to next March as
it seeks better investment returns.
 Analysts expect U.S. payrolls figures on Friday to show
513,000 jobs were added to the economy in May, which could give
the greenback a boost.
 That would bolster expectations that the Federal Reserve will
be first to raise rates ahead of the European Central Bank and
the Bank of Japan.
 The euro climbed 0.3 percent to $1.2285, having bounced from
a four-year low of $1.2110 on Tuesday.
 Despite the bounce overall sentiment towards the single
currency remains bearish. One-month 25 delta risk reversals, a
barometer for short-term fear among speculators and hedge funds,
are still showing an extreme bias for puts, sitting at 2.55/3.05.
 The euro remains sensitive to any signs the euro zone
sovereign debt crisis might spread to the banking system.
 The Australian dollar gained 0.6 percent to $0.8469.
 Traders said better appetite for risk was helping the Aussie
and the Canadian dollar.

 HONG KONG, June 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks jumped on
Thursday, posting their biggest single-day gain in four weeks,
as U.S. housing data fueled optimism about the world's largest
economy.
 Financial bookmakers expect leading European markets to
open up over 1 percent after Wall Street's rally. U.S. stock

 Solid sales growth for May from major U.S. automakers also
helped the auto sector in Japan, while stocks in Seoul received

 The weaker outlook for the yen benefitted the floundering

 But investors remained cautious over Europe's debt
problems.
 ""That (the market bounce) is not to say concerns toward the

 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 3 (Reuters) - The yen was under pressure on
Thursday, extending the previous session's losses, as a strong
rebound in stock markets lent support to higher-yielding
currencies, and even to the floundering euro.
 In Asian trade, the U.S. dollar climbed to 92.20 yen ,
from 92.10 yen late in New York on Wednesday when it gained 1.2
percent to hit a two-week high of 92.36 yen. Near term resistance
is seen at 92.96 yen, the daily high hit on May 18.
 Traders said political uncertainty was also playing a role in
the yen's sharp reversal this week. [ID:nTOE65100Q]. Japanese
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned on Wednesday, stoking
speculation that his likely successor would take a tougher stance
to fight the yen's strength.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan is tipped to be the successor. Kan
surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted the yen
to weaken more and that most businesses favoured a dollar/yen
rate around 95 yen.
 Since then he has mostly toed the Ministry line that stable
currencies are desirable and markets should set foreign exchange
levels.
 There were also signs that the yen could return as a funding
currency for carry trades.
 ""That the yen has not been able to make serious gains against
the dollar in a most favourable negative risk environment will
encourage the market to put the yen in line as a funder, albeit
after the euro,"" Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS wrote in a note.
 The U.S. dollar found support from upbeat domestic data,
including numbers released on Wednesday which showed pending
sales of previously owned homes topping expectations.
 Analysts expect U.S. payrolls figures on Friday to show
513,000 jobs were added to the economy in May, which could give
the greenback a boost. That would bolster expectations that the
Federal Reserve will be first to raise rates ahead of the
European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.
 The euro was steady on the yen  at 112.72 yen,
having jumped over 1.3 percent on Wednesday. Against the dollar,
the euro  was steady around $1.2240, having bounced from a
four-year low of $1.2110 on Tuesday.
 Despite the bounce overall sentiment towards the single
currency remains bearish. One-month 25 delta risk reversals
, a barometer for short term fear among speculators
and hedge funds, are still showing an extreme bias for puts,
sitting at 3.05.
 The euro remains sensitive to any signs the euro zone
sovereign debt crisis might spread to the banking system.
 The Australian dollar  held on to smart gains made on
Wednesday. It traded above $0.8400, with resistance seen at
$0.8436, the daily high hit on June 1.

 JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Reuters) - Rich countries need to

 In a report analysing Africa's small but evolving clout, the
Royal Institute of International Affairs at London's Chatham
House challenged the Western perception of Africa as a hopeless
case, painting it rather as home to a billion people and up to
40 percent of the world's natural resources.
 Its strategic position between Asia and the Americas
increases its long-term appeal and potential, the report said.
 ""The overwhelmingly humanitarian interest of many Western
countries and traditional partners has led to stereotyped
perceptions of Africa in terms only of problems,"" it said.
 ""These views are increasingly patronizing, recursive, out of
touch, and a deterrent to serious business interest. Meanwhile
the emerging economic powers of the G20 see Africa in terms of
opportunities, as a place in which to invest, gain market share
and win access to resources.""
 Highlighting the shift, China overtook the United States
last year as Africa's biggest trading partner, and when Barack
Obama -- whose father was Kenyan -- made his first visit as U.S.
president, he spent less than a day in just one country.
 By contrast his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, made a
four-country trip in February to remind Africa what a firm
friend it had in Beijing as the first waves of the global
economic storm washed up on the continent's shores.
 A week ago, Irish rockers Bono and Bob Geldof and their
anti-poverty ONE Campaign chastised the Group of Eight (G8) rich
nations for failing to deliver on a 2005 promise to double aid
spending by this year.
 ONE Campaign singled out Italy as ""an utter failure"" for
actually cutting aid from 2004 levels, rather than raising it,
and praised efforts by the United States and Britain.
 But the Chatham House report asked whether campaigns to open
up Western wallets were to Africa's advantage.
 ""The over-promising of what aid can deliver and the emphasis
placed on aid to the exclusion and deterrence of considerations
of business and private-sector links have diminished the
relevance of the G8 for Africa,"" it said.
 ""The emerging economies of the G20 have brought
entrepreneurialism, energy and recognition of mutual benefits
that are increasingly attractive.""
 In a note of caution, the report said Africa's political
leaders might not be able to ensure the continent accrued the
full benefits of the increased competition for its natural
resources from the likes of China, India, Brazil and Russia.
 ""Without strong, effective leadership the competition for
Africa's resources may degenerate into the kind of colonial
exploitative scramble from which much of the continent has
only recently begun to recover,"" it said.

 * Michigan senators urge Locke to launch currency probe
 * Looming deadline requires Commerce decide soon - lawyer
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department
is seriously considering investigating U.S. industry charges
that China's ""undervalued currency"" is an illegal trade
subsidy, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said in a letter
obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.
 In two separate case before the Commerce Department, U.S.
producers have argued that China's currency, known as the yuan
or the renminbi, is significantly undervalued against the
dollar, giving Chinese companies an unfair price advantage.
 The two cases involve imports of coated paper and a
manufactured aluminum product from China.
 China's currency practices have been an explosive trade
issue, with many U.S. lawmakers calling for the Obama
administration to brand China a currency manipulator. Such a
finding would trigger increased pressure on Beijing to let the
yuan rise, after having effectively pegged it to the dollar for
the past 22 months.
 ""I assure you the allegation that China's undervalued
currency constitutes an illegal subsidy is an important issue
for the department, and we are giving it our full attention and
consideration,"" Locke said in a May 13 letter to Representative
Michael Michaud.
 An investigation could occur only after confirming the
petitioner's allegation meets the statutory requirements for a
probe, Locke said.
 ""We are currently in the process of carefully analyzing the
information and arguments on the records of these proceedings
in order to make such determinations,"" he said.
 Michaud, a Democrat, was one of 130 U.S. lawmakers who
wrote to Locke and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in
March to complain about China's exchange rate practices.
 In the letter, they called on the Obama administration to
formally brand China a currency manipulator and to use U.S.
countervailing duty laws to defend ""American companies who have
suffered as a result of the currency manipulation.""
 That message was reinforced on Wednesday in a separate
letter sent by Senators Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin, both
Michigan Democrats.
 ""We urge you to promptly initiate an investigation of
whether currency undervaluation is a subsidy"" in both the
coated paper and the aluminum product case, they said.
 Geithner has tread carefully on whether China is a currency
manipulator, delaying an April 15 semi-annual report on the
issue until late June at the earliest.
 During high-level talks last week in Beijing, Geithner
welcomed Chinese President Hu Jintao's comment that China was
committed to currency reform at its own pace.
 China's currency practices are likely to be on agenda at
this week's Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in South
Korea.
 With Western economists estimating that China's yuan is
undervalued by as much as 40 percent, a gradual appreciation
would not immediately satisfy U.S. industry concerns.
 U.S. Commerce Department officials met with staffers from
Michaud and other congressional offices on Tuesday to expound
on Locke's May 13 letter.
 They gave no indication how close they are to deciding
whether to launch a countervailing duty currency probe, a
Michaud spokesman said.
 The Commerce Department's under secretary for international
trade, Francisco Sanchez, also declined to say when a decision
would come.
 ""I really can't comment other than to say it's under
review,"" Sanchez told reporters after a speech on Wednesday to
Washington International Trade Association.
 In both cases, China's exchange rate policy is just one of
many subsidies alleged by U.S. producers.
 A final decision on all countervailing duties in the coated
paper case is due Sept. 20, making it urgent the Commerce
Department decide soon whether to investigate the currency
allegation, said Gilbert Kaplan, an attorney at King & Spalding
involved in both cases.

 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied more than
2 percent on Wednesday as energy shares rebounded one day after
a steep sell-off, while the yen fell after the resignation of
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama raised concerns about
the outlook for the currency.

 TORONTO, June 2 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar hit a
two-week high against the U.S. currency on Wednesday as healthy
U.S. economic data spurred risk appetite and the market bought
into the notion that the Bank of Canada will continue to raise
interest rates.
 Figures showing stronger-than-expected U.S. pending home
sales for April provided more evidence of U.S. economic
recovery. [ID:nN02163984]
 That sparked on strong session on North American stock
markets, which pushed the Canadian dollar to an intraday high
at C$1.0371 to the U.S. dollar, a level not seen since May 18.
 ""It's just some reversal from yesterday's decent selloff
with a little risk-on today and that clearly benefits the
Canadian dollar,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, economist at BMO
Capital Markets.
 The Canadian dollar  closed at C$1.0384 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.30 U.S. cents, up from C$1.0540 to the U.S.
dollar, or 94.88 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close.
 The currency was initially weaker as the market struggled
to clarify its view of Tuesday's Bank of Canada moves. The bank
raised interest rates on Tuesday, as expected, but gave no
clear indication whether it would continue to do so.
[ID:nN01103957] [ID:nN01264788] [ID:nN01123836]
 Currencies usually strengthen as interest rates rise as
higher rates attract capital flows.
 As the day progressed, market consensus grew that rates
will have to continue to rise this year from current
emergency-level lows.
 Most of Canada's primary securities dealers, surveyed on
Tuesday, maintained their forecasts that interest rates will
continue to go up through the year. [ID:nN01126499]
 ""Canada's fundamentals are still very strong. They will be
raising rates eventually and the world doesn't seem to mind if
it's a little bit down the road, they'll still invest in the
Canadian dollar,"" said John Curran, senior vice-president at
CanadianForex, a commercial foreign exchange firm.
 ""Comparatively speaking, people are still finding value at
these levels. If you look at Canada, compared to everything
else out there, it still looks gold.""
 The market's next major focus will be Friday's U.S. and
Canadian employment data, and the currency could stay
relatively range bound until those figures are released.
 In Canada, the median forecast is for a net gain of 12,500
jobs in May after a record gain of 108,700 in April. The median
forecast for the unemployment rate is 8.1 percent. [ID:nECICA]
[ID:nN01257964]
 BONDS LOWER
 Canadian bond prices slumped across the curve as investor
sentiment shifted to riskier assets such as stocks.
 An C$3 billion auction of two-year government bonds met
with solid demand, the day after the Bank of Canada raised
interest rates and left markets to deliberate on the tempo of
future rate increases. [ID:nN02174312] [CA/AUC]
 ""There will be a lot of hand-wringing before each meeting
but ultimately we think (the Bank of Canada) will be nudged
into rate moves for most of the meetings for the remainder of
the year,"" said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income
and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 The two-year Canadian government bond  sagged 11
Canadian cents to yield 1.764 percent, while the 10-year bond
 fell 78 Canadian cents to yield 3.379 percent.
 The Canadian two-year bond was 95.4 basis points above the
U.S. 2-year yield, compared with 94.5 basis points on Tuesday.

 Earlier, the single currency fell after European Central
Bank board member Christian Noyer was cited as saying the
single currency's exchange rate against the greenback was at
around a 10-year average and ""by no means an unusually low

 Traders described the euro's gain late in the session as
""anemic"" at best, with perhaps higher U.S. stock prices
indicating slightly more risk appetite.
 ""It's a pause, that's all,"" said John McCarthy, director of
foreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in New York, of
the euro move. ""Nothing has changed from the European
standpoint.""
 Analysts at ScotiaCapital said technical signals on the
euro are mixed, but they expect further downside before the
currency is able to sustain a rally. The next key level of
support is the psychological $1.20, followed by $1.1835, the
average level of the euro since its inception.
 The euro hit a four-year low of $1.2110 on Tuesday, and
remains sensitive to any signs the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis might spread to the banking system of the 16-nation
region.
 Euro/dollar risk reversals are at extreme levels, showing a
bias for puts at a bid of -3.5 on Wednesday, according to GFI
data. Wednesday's figure was, however, off the highs from two

ever been on the euro since GFI made its data available to

 * SDR proposal by China and others gaining momentum
 * G20 could foster gradual monetary revamp for decade ahead
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - If the euro's potential as a
perfect ""anti-dollar"" in world currency reserves has been
stunted by an existential euro zone debt crisis, more radical
rethinking of the global monetary system may now gain momentum.
 Governments around the world have for decades bristled at
U.S. ""seigniorage"" from providing the world's de facto reserve
currency -- what France's Valery Giscard d'Estaing in the 1960s
called America's ""exorbitant privilege"".
 China, Russia, Brazil and the International Monetary Fund
now all want a greater use and sponsorship of Special Drawing
Rights -- a basket of dollars, euros, yen and sterling that acts
as a claim on the IMF and its 186 member countries and a
supra-national reserve asset.
 In essence, reserve status -- however well earned -- allows
the U.S. to simply print more dollars to buy dollar-priced
global goods such as oil and commodities. And any resulting drop
in its exchange rate earns U.S. entities a tidy margin on
overseas assets while foreigners' dollar reserves are devalued.
 Fear of this potential conflict of interest between the
domestic and international policy obligations of the reserve
currency country, the so-called Triffin Dilemma, has intensified
in recent years as global hard-cash reserves soared past $8
trillion and U.S. deficits ballooned.
 The euro, which cut the dollar share of world reserves by
almost 10 percentage points to 62 percent since launch in 1999,
held out some chance of dividing the risks. But if the euro,
which now accounts for more than a quarter of world reserves,
has been hit by at least a temporary roadblock, then what next?
 Few policymakers, including many in the United States, want
to rebuild a uni-polar system that has fostered a timebomb of
global imbalances between America and the developing world --
imbalances at least partly for to blame for three years of
devastating financial crises.
 What is more, the dollar-centric system has periodically led
to acute dollar shortages in global banks still heavily
dependent on dollar funding. Even U.S. Federal Reserve chief Ben
Bernanke last month said foreign banks may need to be weaned off
their over-dependency and said the Fed should not necessarily
provide a ""permanent service"" of pumping dollars overseas.
 China -- which alone holds more than a quarter of world
reserves -- and other developing countries remain anxious of the
scale of their collective $4 trillion exposure to U.S. fiscal
and monetary probity.
 But with euro angst a new backdrop, more finance chiefs from
the world's top 20 economies -- meeting in South Korea this week
-- may think beyond even the dual-currency setup.
 
 SUPRA-NATIONAL RESERVE ASSET
 Just over a year ago, China's central bank chief Zhou
Xiaochuan put the case for developing the SDR -- currently only
4 percent of world stockpiles -- as a reserve asset and
advocated inclusion of its yuan in the basket, a five-yearly
review of which is due later in 2010.
 A month after Zhou's paper, and after a gap of 30 years, the
unit was revived as a tool to ease the financial raging crisis
and the IMF transferred an allocation of $250 billion in SDRs to
all members based on their quotas at the Fund.
 Paulo Nogueira Batista, who represents Brazil and eight
other countries at the IMF board, told Reuters last week this
could be used again in a fresh bout of stress.
 One advantage of the SDR is that, as an IOU, it need not be
realized unless the reserves themselves have to be spent. Given
much of the buildup of reserves has been far in excess of what
would be required in any emergency, use of the SDR as an asset
could have a less distorting impact on capital flows than
requiring the creation of more and more dollar and euro assets.
 Its big disadvantage, at least for the 43 reserve managers
polled by Central Banking Publications late last year, is that
issuance requires political agreement and liquidity is
questionable due to a lack of use in the private sector.
 Independent analysts reckon the dollar's primary status
should not nor could not vanish over a few years. But many see
gradual development of the SDR alongside the existing world
currencies as desirable over the decade ahead.
 One proposal this week from the World Economic Forum's
year-long Global Redesign programme was to make SDR allocations
on a regular basis in amounts to satisfy on-going demand for
official reserves. It suggested $200 billion per year.
 A report led by think tank Chatham House in March detailed
measures to expand SDR usage, including an independent IMF body
to decide on new issuance; creation of an IMF substitution
account where countries can swap constituent currencies for
SDRs; and encouragement of private use by allowing SDR
securities and settlement systems to be created.
 Big banks too see the argument strengthening. ""Providing
more SDR assets would spread out the gains from seigniorage more
broadly and also reduce the structural risks associated with
requiring the U.S. to pump out more dollar assets for the
still-growing stock of overall reserves,"" Goldman Sachs said
last week.

at best, with perhaps higher U.S. stock prices indicating
slightly more risk appetite.
 ""It's a pause, that's all,"" said John McCarthy, director of
foreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in New York of
the euro move. ""Nothing has changed from the European
standpoint.""
 Analysts at ScotiaCapital said technical signals on the
euro are mixed, but they expect further downside before the
currency is able to sustain a rally. The next key level of
support is the psychological $1.20, followed by $1.1835, the
average level of the euro since its inception.
 The euro hit a four-year low of $1.2110 on Tuesday, and
remains sensitive to any signs the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis might spread to the banking system of the 16-nation
region.
 Euro/dollar risk reversals are at extreme levels, showing a
bias for puts at a bid of -3.5 on Wednesday, according to GFI
data. Wednesday's figure was, however, off the highs from two
weeks ago, which was at -3.73, the most bearish investors had
ever been on the euro since GFI made its data available to
Reuters in early 2007.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2010 01:51PM ET</span>",Iraqi Kurdish leader in Turkey for landmark visit," * Landmark visit by man long reviled by Turkish elite
 * Turks now see Iraqi Kurds as natural allies
 * Barzani may condemn terrorism, blow to PKK rebels
 * Turks, Kurds want good ties, stability in post-U.S. Iraq
 
 By Ayla Jean Yackley
 ISTANBUL, June 2 (Reuters) - Turkey and Iraq already enjoy
burgeoning trade and security cooperation, but Iraqi Kurdish
leader Massoud Barzani's first visit to Ankara since the U.S.
invasion in 2003 is a breakthrough for regional stability.
 Turkey's political and military establishment has long
reviled Barzani, president of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous
government, as a sympathiser with Turkey's Kurdish rebels and a
supporter of Kurdish independence.
 Barzani, who arrived in Ankara on Wednesday, is expected to
discuss cooperation with Turkey in its fight against Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK) guerrillas who attack Turkish forces from
bases in northern Iraq, and his visit will also help break down
barriers between the Turkish state and its own ethnic minority.
 Henri Barkey of the Carnegie Institute for International
Peace said Barzani's landmark visit, unimaginable only a few
years ago, showed how dramatically Turkish policy towards Iraqi
Kurds and Turkish strategy on Iraq had changed.
 Tension between Turks and Kurds has made for instability in
southeast Turkey and the border region for years, but the two
governments have recently given higher priority to cooperation.
 ""Someone who was only referred to as a tribal leader and
unwelcome in Turkey is now being received with dignity,"" Barkey
said. ""Turkey understands that Iraqi Kurds are its most natural
allies, dependent on Ankara for trade and diplomatic support.""
 Until recently Turkey tried to isolate Iraqi Kurds, worried
that their autonomy, enshrined in the Iraqi constitution, would
stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million Kurds.
 Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government now believes
Turkey can wield greater influence in Iraq -- and balance
Iranian clout in Baghdad -- by boosting relations with the Kurds
before the U.S. troop withdrawal in 2011, analysts said.
 ""Mutual trust between Kurdistan and Turkey is key to
stability in our region. One reason Kurds have drawn closer to
Turkey is the U.S. decision to withdraw from Iraq,"" said Sahin
Alpay, a professor at Bahcesehir University in Istanbul.
 Iraq faces a deepening power vacuum nearly three months
after an election that has failed to produce a government. Kurds
are seen as key players in the formation of a new government.
 Barzani's visit coincides with a jump in violence by the
PKK, and a Turkish foreign ministry official said Turkey expects
him to ""send a strong message against terrorism.""
 
 'SOLIDARITY'
 ""It's time for solidarity against terrorism. Barzani shares
our position. He is coming within this framework,"" Turkish
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters.
 The two sides will discuss security matters, trade and
energy links and the general election, said Safeen Dizayee, a
minister in the Kurdistan Regional Government.
 Iraqi Kurdistan has awarded Turkish companies lucrative
construction and energy contracts, and trade reached $9 billion
last year, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
 Istanbul-based conglomerates Cukurova and Dogan Holding
 are developing oil in the region, which has reserves
of up to 40 billion barrels. Kurdistan wants to build a $1
billion oil pipeline to Ceyhan on Turkey's Mediterranean coast.
 ""Iraqi Kurds have put to rest Turkey's concerns about
whether Iraqi unity will be protected,"" said Dogu Ergil,
political science professor at Ankara University. ""Of all their
neighbours, Kurds trust and need Turkey the most in the region,
and trade ties have solidifed that.""
 Resolving disputes with neighbours is a cornerstone of
Ankara's foreign policy as it seeks to become a regional power.
 Erdogan has expanded Kurdish political and cultural rights
in an effort to end the 25-year conflict with the PKK. But
progress in the so-called Kurdish opening has slowed this year.
 Turkey, the United States and the European Union all label
the PKK a terrorist organisation.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Global stocks rebounded on
Wednesday on favorable April U.S. home sales data, while the
yen fell after Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned,
because his likely successor has previously said he wanted a
weaker yen.
 Oil prices rose above $73 a barrel as the rally in U.S.
stocks eased concerns that Europe's sovereign debt crisis could
restrain a fragile economic recovery, including fuel demand.

 U.S. government debt prices dipped as rising stocks offered
a semblance of stability for jittery investors and curbed the
appetite for safe-haven bonds. [ID:nN02334707]
 Wall Street rallied more than 1 percent, boosted by a
survey that showed pending sales of previously owned U.S. homes
topped expectations in April to hit a six-month high, and as
investors snapped up shares that tumbled during Tuesday's
sell-off.
 The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home
Sales Index, based on sales contracts signed in April,
increased 6.0 percent, to 110.9, as prospective home owners
took advantage of a popular home buyer tax credit. Eligible
homeowners were required to sign sales contracts by April 30,
and must close on the sales by June 30, to qualify for the
federal tax credits. [ID:nN02163984]
 Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales
would rise 5.0 percent.
 ""This report is a confirmation that there's housing demand
out there and confirmation of an improving labor market,"" said
Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated
Investors in New York. ""All of this suggests that things are
improving.""
 European shares also eked out gains in a choppy session on
the upbeat U.S. housing data, and defensive drugmakers gained.

 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index closed up
0.1 percent at 1,003.58 points.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> pared
losses to rise almost 0.4 percent.
 But persistent fears that the euro zone's debt crisis could
jeopardize the region's recovery weighed on banking shares,
pushing down Barclays  2.2 percent and Banco Santander
 1.85 percent.
 ""Investors are still concerned that the euro zone debt
problem is not over, and it will keep hanging over the equity
market until the market gets to a more reasonable valuation,""
said Koen de Leus, economist at KBC Securities.

recovering after the latest failed attempt by BP Plc  to
halt the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the news that the
U.S. government had launched a criminal probe into the

 U.S.-listed shares of BP still managed to climb, rising 2.5

 after Hatoyama stepped aside as prime minister, making
room for his expected replacement, Finance Minister Naoto Kan.

 ""Kan is a noted dove who has been an aggressive proponent

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday as
the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama
raised concerns about the outlook for the currency, because his
likely successor has said in the past he wanted a weaker yen.
 The yen hit a two-week low against the dollar after
Hatoyama and his deputy resigned to try to boost the ruling
party's faltering fortunes in an election next month.
[ID:nTOE65100Q]
 The euro also fell against the dollar as European Central
Bank board member Christian Noyer was cited as saying the
single currency's exchange rate against the greenback was at
around a 10-year average and ""by no means an unusually low
level."" [ID:nSGE65105R]
 The Japanese currency fell as investors focused on
Hatoyama's expected replacement, Finance Minister Naoto Kan,
who has previously advocated a weak yen. Concerns about
political instability were also weighing on the Japanese
currency, analysts said.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses favored a
dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. Since then he has mostly toed
the Finance Ministry line that stable currencies are desirable
and markets should set foreign exchange levels.
 ""Kan is a noted dove who has been an aggressive proponent
of a lower yen in order to help stimulate Japanese exports,""
said Boris Schlossberg, a director of currency research at GFT,
in New York.
 ""With Japanese political situation in state of flux, the
dollar may be the only safe-haven instrument left in the
currency market for the time being,"" he added.
 In midday trading in New York, the dollar was up 1.4
percent on the day at 92.25 yen , while the euro
 gained 1.2 percent to 112.64 yen.
 Some analysts said yen losses were limited as investors
remained hungry for the Japanese currency, which has benefited
from risk aversion stemming from the euro zone debt crisis.
 ""Almost anything you throw at the yen these days is
negative, and yet here we are at these levels. That tells you
demand for yen is for reasons other than what's going on in
Japan,"" said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at BNYM.
 The dollar also rose as data released on Wednesday showed
that pending sales of previously owned homes in the United
States topped expectations to hit a six-month high in April.
[ID:nN02163984]
 ""If you look at this (report) from a yield and growth
differential perspective, I think it's positive for the
dollar,"" said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Easy Forex,
in Chicago. ""If it weren't for the EU debt crisis, I'd be in
the camp that says the Fed moves sooner rather than later"" on
raising interest rates.
 While the report was positive, analysts said the key data
remains the government's monthly reading on non-farm payrolls
due on Friday.
 NOYER COMMENTS

 * New offer to be made by mid-July
 
 GENEVA, June 2 (Reuters) - China will submit a new proposal
by mid-July to the World Trade Organization to join the WTO
government procurement agreement, which regulates trade in
public-sector purchases, trade officials said on Wednesday.
 Chinese membership in the voluntary agreement is keenly
awaited by Beijing's partners, who say the scale of government
purchases in China's economy is potentially huge.
 Yi Xiaozhun, vice-minister of commerce, told WTO members
that China would make the offer before the next meeting of the
global trade body's government procurement committee, due in the
middle of next month, the officials said.
 He was speaking during the WTO review of China's trade
policies, held every two years, at which China faced demands for
more transparency in its trade policy and calls to continue
liberalising its economy -- to which Yi responded by assuring
members that China would continue opening up.
 Some members including the United States had questioned
China's ""indigenous innovation"" policy which they said amounted
to a form of ""Buy China"" favouring domestic producers over
foreign suppliers, but Yi said it applied to all companies
established in China.
 China first applied to join the WTO government procurement
agreement in December 2007 but its partners wanted better terms
than it first offered.
 Worldwide, government procurement accounts for about 23
percent of demand -- nearly a quarter of the economy.
 China estimates that the share of government procurement in
its economy which would be covered by the agreement is much
less.
 Yi said it accounts for only two percent of gross domestic
product because China excludes purchases by state-owned
enterprises and limits the definition to purchases using
budgetary funds above a certain threshold.
 That would still make it worth some 615 billion yuan ($90
billion) a year. 
 So far 41 of the WTO's 153 members have joined the
government procurement agreement, including the EU's 27 members.
The latest to join was Taiwan in 2009.
 All WTO members undergo a trade policy review every two or
four years, with bigger economies assessed more often.
 China received a record 1,500 requests for information ahead
of the review, testifying to the interest in the rapidly growing
economy of the world's second biggest exporter and third biggest
importer.
 During the review it faced calls to open up services such as
banking, insurance, telecoms and postal services, and criticism,
particularly from the United States and European Union, about
restrictions on exports of raw materials.
 In a report for the review, the WTO said the export curbs
may not meet their aim of conserving resources but gave Chinese
manufacturers an unfair advantage.
 But developing countries, especially in Asia, and some rich
nations like New Zealand and Japan, expressed support for the
way China had kept its economy open during the crisis.

428,000 births had been registered in the first quarter, 1.5
percent more than in the same period last year.
 Population forecasts are key to the economic models which
see Russia growing much slower over the next 20 years than the
other BRIC countries, Brazil India and China.
 A sharp change in population trends could improve growth
predictions for Russia, though many experts say it is too early
to call the end of the declines which started in the chaos that
accompanied the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
 ""I hope that we have managed to break those extremely
unfavourable demographic trends which have existed in our
country over the past two decades,"" Medvedev told a Kremlin
meeting to reward the parents of extremely large families.
 ""We were simply declining and I hope we can reverse this
trend,"" said Medvedev, who before he was elected president
administered a Kremlin drive to cut the population decline.
 But Medvedev did not mention that state statistics show the
overall population actually declined by 35,500 in the first
quarter, though the decline was less steep than in the same
period of 2009.
 State statistics show Russia's population would have
declined by 87,300 in the first quarter had it not been for
migration, mostly from the former Soviet republics of Central
Asia and the Caucasus.
 Russia's official forecasts factor in a whole range of
variables that see the country's population either falling to
137 million or rising to 145 million by 2020. The figures for
2030 range from 128 million to nearly 148 million.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday as
the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama
raised concerns about the outlook for the currency, because his
likely successor has said in the past he wanted a weaker yen.
 The yen hit a two-week low against the dollar after
Hatoyama and his deputy resigned to try to boost the ruling
party's faltering fortunes in an election next month.
[ID:nTOE65100Q]
 ""The political turmoil in Japan has damaged some of the
yen's safe harbor reputation as Hatoyama became the fourth
Japanese prime minister in four years to leave the office,""
said Boris Schlossberg, a director of currency research at GFT,
in New York.
 Analysts said concerns about political instability were
weighing on the Japanese currency, though the focus was on
Hatoyama's expected replacement, Finance Minister Naoto Kan,
who has previously advocated a weak yen.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses favored a
dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. Since then he has mostly toed
the finance ministry line that stable currencies are desirable
and markets should set foreign exchange levels.
 ""Kan is a noted dove who has been an aggressive proponent
of a lower yen in order to help stimulate Japanese exports,""
said Schlossberg.
 In mid-morning trading in New York, the dollar was up 1.3
percent on the day at 92.20 yen , while the euro
 gained 1.2 percent to 112.60 yen.
 Some analysts said yen losses were limited as investors
remained hungry for the Japanese currency, which has benefited
from risk aversion stemming from the euro zone debt crisis.
 ""Almost anything you throw at the yen these days is
negative and yet here we are at these levels. That tells you
demand for yen is for reasons other than what's going on in
Japan,"" said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at BNYM.
 In the United States, a report showed pending sales of

 ""If you look at this (report) from a yield and growth
differential perspective, I think it's positive for the
dollar,"" said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Easy Forex,
in Chicago. ""If it weren't for the EU debt crisis, I'd be in
the camp that says the Fed moves sooner rather than later (on
raising interest rates).""
 Analysts also said that while the report was positive, as
regards to data the focus remains on the government's monthly
reading on non-farm payrolls due on Friday.
 NOYER COMMENTS
 Selling pressure on the euro continued on Wednesday and the
currency fell 0.2 percent to $1.2205 .
 Analysts at ScotiaCapital said technical signals on the
euro are mixed, but they expect further downside before the
currency gains the ability sustain a rally. The next key level
of support is the psychological 1.20, followed by 1.1835, the
average level of the euro since its inception.
 The euro also fell as European Central Bank board member
Christian Noyer was cited as saying the single currency's
exchange rate against the dollar was at around a 10-year
average and ""by no means an unusually low level"".
[ID:nSGE65105R]
 The euro hit a four-year low of $1.2110 on Tuesday, and
remains sensitive to any signs the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis might spread to its banking system.
 Euro/dollar risk reversals are at extreme levels, showing a
bias for puts at a bid of -3.5 on Wednesday, according to GFI
data. Wednesday's figure was, however, off the highs from two
weeks ago, which was at -3.73, the most bearish investors had
ever been on the euro since GFI made its data available to
Reuters in early 2007. 
 ""Very few investors are ready to put on long euro/dollar
positions, and any spikes are due to profit taking on short
positions,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at
Nordea in Copenhagen.

 * CDU panel proposes cuts of 150 bln euros by 2016

(Adds comments, quotes by Schaeuble)
 BERLIN, June 2 (Reuters) - The German government faces less
of a challenge than previously anticipated to consolidate its
finances both this year and over the mid-term, German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday.
 An export-led economic recovery, which has boosted the
labour market and reduced outlays on jobless benefits, meant
that federal net new borrowing would likely be below the 80.2
billion euros planned for this year, Schaeuble said in Berlin.
 ""Across the whole stretch through to 2016, the need to
reduce the structural deficit will be slightly lower,"" he said.
 From 2011, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government must take
into account a new ""debt brake"" law requiring Germany to cut the
structural deficit by around 10 billion euros and reduce the
deficit-to-GDP ratio to a limit of 0.35 percent by 2016.
 The fact that the immediate outlook had improved did not,
however, mean that Germany would lower its budgetary
consolidation target for next year, Schaeuble said.
 Merkel's cabinet is due to hold a special session on June
6/7 to discuss measures to consolidate Germany's finances.
 A number of euro zone nations have unveiled austerity
measures to bolster their strained finances in recent weeks, and
some in Germany are insisting on stringent cuts.
 On Wednesday, the pro-business economic panel of Merkel's
conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) proposed savings for the
federal budget worth some 150 billion euros by 2016.
 ""All discounted rates of value-added tax (VAT) except for
that on basic foodstuffs should be abolished,"" said Kurt Lauk,
head of the panel. This would raise VAT on goods and services
affected to 19 percent from 7 percent at present.
 Proceeds from this -- seen at 14 billion euros -- should be
used to lower income tax for middle earners, the panel added.
 In addition, the panel recommended that Germany's standard
top rate of income tax should be raised.

 * Key issue whether austerity measures rethought as result
 * Any unrest in Spain particularly worrying for investors
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - Europe is likely to see
intermittent protests over the summer against painful economic
measures, impacting markets but much tamer than the violent
unrest in Greece that sent jitters through southern Europe.
 Long regarded as the most prone to street violence in
western Europe -- as well as the most financially troubled --
Greece has seen several angry protests culminating in clashes
early last month, that left three dead in a burning bank.
 Greek militant groups have also detonated bombs, one of
which killed an Afghan youth and another targeting the bourse.
 Analysts say in southern Europe in particular, street
protests are likely to recur periodically, but the main concern
is whether governments rethink austerity measures as a result.
 ""There are going to be protests and people are going to try
to torch banks from time to time,"" said Eurasia Group analyst
Jon Levy. ""It is going to be occasional and far from the sort of
thing that will bring society crashing down. But it will get a
lot of media coverage and that means it may well have market
impact.""
 The violence in early May hit Greek assets, the euro and
broader global markets as 24-hour news channels focused on
Greece and investors worried the backlash might prompt the
government to backtrack on vital reforms.
 ""When it comes to market reaction, the important thing is
not so much how bad the violence and damage is as how much media
attention is focused on it,"" said Levy. ""With Greece... it
dominated the media agenda for several days.""
 That wall-to-wall coverage maximised market impact, he said.
 Insurer ssay they have seen a notable uptick in enquiries
about political risk cover -- which protects against
expropriation, political violence and exchange controls --
particularly for Portugal and Spain as they face stringent cuts.
 
 RISK GREATEST IN CAPITAL CENTRES
 That could marginally push up the cost of doing business in
those countries.
 ""The main risk is going to be in capital city centres where
you have a risk of protest,"" said Daniel Riordan, head of
political risk at insurers Zurich.
 But he said the increase had been limited to the southern
euro zone with Ireland -- usually included in the list of
troubled economies with Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain -- not
a big worry for investors at this stage.
 Ireland was the first euro zone country to significantly
slash public spending, mollifying markets and initially
prompting severe street protests. More recent protests have been
on a much smaller scale, if albeit occasionally violent, and
analysts say the population has largely acquiesced to the cuts.
 Ireland's trade unions have also said they are reluctant to
force a major industrial unrest campaign for fear of sparking a
bond market sell-off that would ultimately hurt Ireland more.
That contrasts with a much tougher line in Greece.
 But unions are seen as having little choice but to call
occasional strikes and protests to show they have relevance.
 Analysts say there is also a modest chance of social unrest
in Britain as it pushes through what policymakers say will be
some of the toughest cuts since the Second World War. But again,
any industrial action is expected to be limited and much lower
key than union unrest and poll tax riots in the 1980s.
 ""Britain has just had an election, which in itself usually
reduces the risk of unrest,"" said David Lea, Western Europe
analyst at Control Risks. ""The coalition has a large enough
majority that it's very unlikely unrest would change anything,
so that is also a factor.""
 
 GREEK DEATHS PROMPT REAPPRAISAL
 Overall, most analysts say Italy has probably the greatest
risk of violent unrest along with France, although the latter is
considered to be in much less dire financial difficulties than
the southern euro zone and so even sustained street violence
there would probably have less market impact.
 ""Social unrest trends in France have never had that much to
do with economic cycles anyway,"" said Lea. ""When you saw the
violence in the suburbs several years ago there was no market
impact at all.""
 Markets would probably react more negatively to violent
demonstrations in Spain, worried that could prompt the
government to roll back on its only recently announced austerity
measures and further undermine its battered creditworthiness.
 But Spanish unions are ultimately seen as reluctant to risk
toppling the government and ushering the right into power.
 Even in Greece, analysts say the death of three last month
severely dented appetites for further demonstration violence.
Since then, turnout at street protests has fallen markedly.
 ""I think the deaths ... prompted something of a
reassessment,"" said Exclusive Analysis Western Europe analyst
Pepe Egger. ""The anarchists don't have a problem with
destruction of property but they don't want to kill.""
 Greece fringe groups would continue to mount occasional bomb
attacks on banks and other targets, he said, but such incidents
have a long history in Greece with minimal investor impact.
 ""The police caught those behind the car bomb attack on the
stock exchange but there are at least two other groups and we
can expect this to continue,"" he said. ""But this is really
something you only see in Greece.""

 TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen retreated on Wednesday
after Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned, reflecting
the view that the front-runner to take over from him may take a
tougher stance on fighting yen strength.
 But Japanese stock and government bond markets are expected
to take Hatoyama's resignation in their stride, with little
fallout seen from the political turbulence in Tokyo that has
limited major economic initiatives, including tackling the huge
public debt.
 Many traders said any further trouble from the euro zone debt
crisis would overshadow the political instability in Tokyo, as
Hatoyama was the fourth straight Japanese premier to step down
after being in office a year or less.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan is seen as front-runner to lead
the Democratic Party of Japan and become prime minister, though
other senior party officials may run for the post.
 Here are some questions and answers on the market impact.
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE YEN?
 The yen dropped on hedge fund selling after Hatoyama's
resignation, partly on the view that Kan would be the most likely
successor.
 Investors may be reluctant to test the government's tolerance
threshold for a strong currency as Kan has been vocal about the
administration doing more to prevent the yen rising, especially
at times when it has climbed towards 80 per dollar. It was at
91.80 yen on Wednesday.
 Kan caused a stir when he became finance minister in January
by saying he would work with the Bank of Japan to weaken the yen,
and ""it would be nice"" if the Japanese currency slipped further.
 The BOJ's special money market funding operations, launched
in December and expanded in March, have also been seen as a means
of trying to prevent the yen from strengthening further.
 Kan, who was national strategy minister when the operation
was launched, said he was glad the BOJ acted ""quickly in
cooperation with the government in response to the yen's rise"".
 Kan has been among those repeatedly piling the pressure on
the BOJ for more action.
 ""The market may become cautious over the possibility of
government moves to restrain yen strength because Kan has shown
his preference for a weaker yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief
FX strategist in Japan at Barclays Capital.
 Japan is also struggling with the yen's surge against the
euro as the European debt crisis has slammed the single currency
across the board.
 The euro slid to an eight-year low against the yen last week
near 108.80 and was near there on Wednesday.
 WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON JGBs?
 Investors are looking for Kan or another successor to make
clear statements about raising the country's consumption tax and
other measures to rein in the deficit.
 Such a move would be very positive for the JGB market, said
Alexander Duering, head of relative value research for the Asia
Pacific region at Deutsche Securities.
 ""I think people understand that Japan cannot change the
budget situation from one day to the next. But especially with
issues like the consumption tax, there could be clear directions
taken one way or the other,"" Duering said.
 Kan has sounded more positive than Hatoyama about raising the
5 percent sales tax in the future and is regarded by market
players as recognising the need to limit debt issuance.
 One complication is the greater clout of the DPJ's coalition
partner, the People's New Party. Its leader, banking minister
Shizuka Kamei, is an outspoken advocate of big fiscal spending.
 Even if Kan were to succeed Hatoyama and to speak out in
favour of increasing taxes, he is likely to face opposition from
within his coalition.
 While some investors fret that Japan could face its own debt
crisis in coming years, that day of reckoning is not seen coming
anytime soon as the country funds its debts -- at about 200
percent of GDP -- almost entirely from domestic savings.
 At 1.240 percent, benchmark yields are near the lowest levels
in the past five years. But five-year CDS spreads have swelled to
92 basis points from just 12 basis points in the past year,
reflecting worries about trouble down the road. Volumes on
Japanese sovereign CDS have reached record highs.
 AND FOR JAPANESE STOCKS?
 Stocks are unlikely to be impacted unless the government gets
more aggressive with the BOJ and forces easier monetary policy,
or worries about the debt situation spill over into the market.
 Other issues, such as the euro zone crisis and China's
economic strength, are likely to have a greater sway over the
Nikkei, which is down 9 percent this year after the selloff in
risky assets last month.
 The stronger correlation between euro/yen and the Nikkei
compared with dollar/yen and the Nikkei highlights the growing
influence of the euro on global stocks.
 ""I don't think it's going to change anything much,"" said
Pascal Masse, head of the investment department at Aberdeen
Investment Management in Tokyo.

 By Linda Sieg and Chisa Fujioka
 TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yukio
Hatoyama and his powerful ruling party No. 2 quit on Wednesday
to try to boost the party's fortunes in an election next month,
less than a year after sweeping to power with promises of
change.
 The political turmoil could delay efforts to thrash out
plans set to be announced this month to cut the country's
public debt, which stands at about 200 percent of GDP, and a
strategy to engineer economic growth in an ageing society.
 But if, as many expect, fiscally conservative Finance
Minister Naoto Kan takes the helm, that could raise the chances
of bolder steps to rein in debt, including a pledge to consider
raising the 5 percent sales tax.
 Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) made history
with a landslide election win last year, promising to change
how Japan is governed after more than 50 years of cosy ties
among bureaucrats, companies and lawmakers under the Liberal
Democrats.
 But after eight months of indecision and broken promises,
the 63-year-old Hatoyama -- nicknamed ""The Alien"" for his
quirky comments -- bowed to pressure from his party to quit
ahead of an election for the upper house of parliament expected
in July.
 An election loss would not oust the DPJ-led government
given its majority in the more powerful lower house, but the
ruling bloc needs a majority to keep legislation from being
stalled.
 With tears in his eyes, Hatoyama told party lawmakers he
and party secretary-general Ichiro Ozawa would resign.
 Hatoyama said later that, without public support, the
government could not meet its goals.
 ""So I decided that my resignation would serve this
country's interests,"" Hatoyama, who becomes Japan's fourth
leader to quit in less than three years, told reporters.
 Hatoyama's ratings had nosedived because of voter doubts
about his leadership. Ozawa's image as an old-style powerbroker
pulling strings behind the scenes also eroded public support.
 FINANCE MINISTER KAN NEXT?
 Kan, seen as the frontrunner to replace Hatoyama, told
reporters he would run in a vote among DPJ lawmakers on Friday.
 ""Unfortunately there wasn't enough time under prime
minister Hatoyama to meet the expectations the people had when
they voted for us last autumn, so I want to keep trying,"" he
said.
 No other candidates have yet raised their hands, although
Kan's victory would not be a done deal if the still-powerful
Ozawa backed someone else.
 A new cabinet will then be formed on the same day, a DPJ
official said, quicker than many had thought.
 The yen slipped after the resignations but financial market
reaction was mostly muted given the slim chance of radical
economic policy shifts, persistent uncertainty about the
election outcome and a deep sense of deja vu after another
premier quit.
 The likely selection of Kan, who made his name battling
bureaucrats during a stint as health minister, would be
welcomed by investors and voters worried about Japan's public
debt, although lawmakers up for re-election will probably be
cautious.
 ""Whether he gets his way at this juncture is hard to tell,""
said Koichi Nakano, a Sophia University professor.
 The short-tempered Kan has in the past pressed the Bank of
Japan to do more to fight deflation and been positive about
raising the 5 percent sales tax in the future to fund bulging
social welfare costs.
 ""If finance minister Kan takes over, it would be welcome
news for the JGB market because Kan is more proactive about
fiscal discipline and about raising the consumption tax than
any other cabinet minister,"" said Hirokata Kusaba, economist at
Mizuho Research Institute.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses were in favour
of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. Since then he has mostly
toed the ministry line that stable currencies are desirable and
markets should set foreign exchange levels.
 The Bank of Japan, which wants a credible government plan
to rein in the huge public debt, is worried a policy stalemate
will delay fiscal reform. But the political vacuum will give
the central bank breathing space and ease government pressure
for more action on deflation, at least until after the
election.
 ELECTION BOUNCE
 Some analysts said the change of the party's top two
leaders would give the Democrats a boost before the election,
but most expect the party and its small ally, the New People's
Party, still to fall short of a majority in the lower house.
 ""A big reason for the falling support was the
Hatoyama-Ozawa duo,"" said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior fellow at
the Tokyo Foundation think tank. ""Now that they have gotten rid
of both, they can appeal to voters that they can govern
better.""
 Optimists say a new post-election coalition might even be
more consistent on policies, such as the need to rein in debt.
 But not all voters were impressed, and some are likely
either to cast their ballots for one of the new small parties
recently formed by Liberal Democratic Party rebels -- or stay
home.
 ""This is making me lean towards neither the Liberal
Democratic Party nor the Democratic Party. I might end up
having no party to vote for,"" said Yoshimasa Muroi, a
consultant.
 A change in leadership is unlikely to alter Japan's
ambitious goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent
from 1990 levels by 2020, but could delay a law needed to
implement it.
 Hatoyama took office in September with ratings of more than
70 percent from voters hoping the party would make good on
promises to cut waste, pry policy control away from
bureaucrats, and put more money in consumers' hands to boost
domestic demand.
 But doubts over his leadership skills helped erode the
government's approval ratings, with one poll showing support at
just 17 percent after he failed to keep a campaign pledge to
move a U.S. airbase off Okinawa island in southern Japan.
 Japan's new leader will also face a tough task keeping ties

 LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday after
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned, particularly as
his likely successor has in the past taken a tougher stance in
fighting yen strength.

and his deputy resigned to try to boost the ruling party's
faltering fortunes in an election next month. [ID:nTOE65100Q]
 Analysts said concerns about political instability were
weighing on the Japanese currency, though the focus was on
Hatoyama's expected replacement, Finance Minister Naoto Kan,
because he has previously advocated a weak yen.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses favoured a
dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. Since then he has mostly toed the
finance ministry line that stable currencies are desirable and
markets should set foreign exchange levels.
 ""If the position does fall to Kan, then the bias will be
towards a slightly weaker yen,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at nabCapital.
 At 1042 GMT, the dollar was up 1.1 percent on the day at a
two-week high around 92.00 yen , while the euro 
gained 1.2 percent to 112.37 yen.
 Some analysts said yen losses were limited as investors
remained hungry for the Japanese currency, which has benefited
from risk aversion stemming from the euro zone debt crisis.
 ""Almost anything you throw at the yen these days is negative
and yet here we are at these levels. That tells you demand for
yen is for reasons other than what's going on in Japan,"" said
Simon Derrick, head of currency research at BNYM.
 
 NOYER COMMENTS
 Against the dollar, the euro  was slightly lower at
$1.2210.
 Iran's state-owned Press TV said the Iranian central bank
would sell 45 billion euros from its foreign exchange reserves
to buy dollars and gold. [ID:nnLDE651111]
 Traders said there was limited impact on the euro, and some
were sceptical about whether Tehran would be able to buy
significant amounts of dollars, given that U.S. depository
institutions are banned from processing transfers involving
Iran.
 The dollar <.DXY> rose 0.4 percent against a currency basket
to 86.898, hovering near a 15-month high hit on Tuesday.
 The euro took a knock earlier after European Central Bank
board member Christian Noyer was cited as saying the single
currency's exchange rate against the dollar was at around a
10-year average and ""by no means an unusually low level"".
[ID:nSGE65105R]
 The euro hit a four-year low of $1.2110 on Tuesday, and
remains sensitive to any signs the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis might spread to its banking system.
 However, it recovered on Wednesday after government sources
in Brazil, India, Japan and South Korea said they would not stop
investing in the currency. [ID:nTOE650069]
 Traders also said investors were wary of renewing short euro
positions after taking a hit from the currency's sharp upswing
on Tuesday following its slide to a four-year low.
 ""Very few investors are ready to put on long euro/dollar
positions, and any spikes are due to profit taking on short
positions,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at
Nordea in Copenhagen.

 TEHRAN, June 2 (Reuters) - Iran's central bank will sell 45
billion euros from reserves to buy dollars and gold, state-owned
media said on Wednesday, signalling a u-turn on a long-standing
policy to limit exposure to the currency of its most powerful
enemy.
 The website of broadcaster Press TV quoted a report in Jam-e
Jam newspaper, in which unnamed ""reliable sources"" said the
decision, to be implemented by late September, had been taken in
response to the euro zone's debt crisis.
 The euro was little changed after the reports, easing
slightly from $1.2227 to fluctuate around $1.2200 as some market
players concluded Iran might struggle to buy such a large
quantity of dollars.
 ""Central bank foreign currency experts ... believe that this
economic crisis in Europe is getting worse and will lead to a
further fall in the value of the euro and will increase the
value of the dollar,"" the paper said in its Monday edition.
 ""This plan aims, gradually, during the next four months, to
convert around 45 billion euros into dollars.""
 The report said it ""seemed that"" the first of three phases,
a sale of 15 billion euros, started ""at the beginning of this
(Iranian) month"", which began on May 22. The operation would be
complete by the end of summer, it said. In Iran that is
considered to be Sept. 22.
 Officials at the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of
Iran declined comment. The bank usually does not announce such
decisions.
 Iran also does not usually disclose the value of its
reserves, though state television reported last December they
exceeded $80 billion. Jam-e Jam said the new policy move would
reduce the proportion of euros in Iran's total reserves to
between 20 and 25 percent from a previous 55 percent.
 
 ""WORTHLESS""
 Appearing to give precedence to economic factors over
ideology, the switch would be a major policy reversal for
Tehran, which for many years has shunned the dollar as part of
its opposition to Washington.
 At a 2007 OPEC summit, Iran -- the world's fifth-largest oil
exporter -- suggested oil should be priced in a basket of
currencies rather than dollars, but it failed to win over other
member states except Venezuela.
 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told reporters at that
time the dollar was a ""worthless piece of paper"".
 At recently as last November, central bank governor Mahmoud
Bahmani said Iran's then policy of moving away from the dollar,
both in its reserves and in the currency it received for its oil
exports had been beneficial. [ID:nDAH340738] 
 Press TV reported at the time that since late 2007, 85
percent of Iran's oil income had been in currencies other than
the dollar and that it aimed to increase that to 100 percent.
 Jam-e Jam said the central bank would now ""encourage"" a
complete reversal of that policy.
 ""For those organisations which receive the most foreign
currency, it is strongly recommended to minimise their trades in
euros,"" it said. ""The most vivid example of this issue is the
significant reduction in the acceptance of euros for the sale of
Iran's oil.""
 Traders said the news was having limited impact on the euro,
and some in the market were sceptical about whether Tehran would
be able to buy significant amounts of dollars, given that U.S.
depository institutions are banned from processing transfers
involving the country.
 A new draft of Iranian sanctions under discussion at the
U.N. Security Council cites the central bank in a paragraph
calling on U.N. member states to be vigilant in all transactions
with Iranian banks to ensure they are not linked to Tehran's
nuclear or missile programs.
 But the new sanctions would not blacklist the central bank
completely -- a proposal that was rejected by Russia, China and
Germany, who feared it would make it impossible to do any
business with Iran.
 Bahmani made a first hint that Iran would move away from the
euro last month.
 ""Considering that the value of the euro is plummeting and
that of the dollar is increasing, we will be examining the issue
of changing the composition of Iran's hard currency basket,"" he
was quoted as saying in the May 18 edition of Hezbollah daily.
[ID:nLDE64H0B3]
 Wednesday's report on the sale broke after official sources
told Reuters that some of the world's richest central banks
would continue investing in Europe's ailing single currency,
supporting its reserve status despite the sovereign debt crisis
plaguing the region.
 The liquidity of both the euro and the dollar and the
difficulty of switching large portfolios to other currencies
mean there are no alternatives to them in the near term, the
sources in Brazil, India, Japan and South Korea said in separate
interviews. [ID:nLDE6510EO]

444,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2010 07:19AM ET</span>",Euro zone sanctions would restore mkt trust-Finland," VILNIUS, June 2 (Reuters) - The euro zone needs to agree on
sanctions to make sure every member follows the rules to regain
market confidence, Finland's prime minister said on Wednesday.
 Greece has negotiated a 110 billion euro ($135 billion)
rescue package with the EU and IMF to help it deal with its debt
crisis, but the markets were gripped with fears of spill-over to
over euro zone member states, driving the euro down.
 ""Today we have a lack of confidence...Markets do not trust
that we are following our own rules,"" Matti Vanhanen told a news
conference at the Baltic Sea States Summit.
 He said sanctions were needed to punish those who are
breaking the criteria agreed in the EU treaties or not following
recommendations from the European Commission or the Council.
 ""One quite effective sanction may be if we cut payments to
the member states, one sanction has been mentioned that you have
no right to vote, or there can be also some other sanctions,"" he
said.
 ""The result has to be that we can trust everyone follows the
rules.""
 Germany, the biggest contributor to the package, wants to
strengthen the enforcement of EU budget rules with stiffer
penalties for rampant violators.
 However, EU officials have said penalties including the
withdrawal of voting rights in extreme cases already existed in
EU treaties, and that leaders were already considering creating
a stronger link between access to EU funds and compliance with
the rules.
 Vanhanen later also told journalists that he believed euro
zone member states may come up with a decision regarding
sanctions within a few months.
 ""I believe that during the next few months it is possible to
find if we have strong enough political commitments to accept
these sanctions,"" he told journalists.
 ""Actually, I think that the precondition for the Greece
package was these sanctions,"" he added.
 The euro , which fell more than 7 percent against the
dollar in May, hit a new four-year low on Tuesday on worries
that the euro zone's debt crisis is spreading to its banking
system. It is down around 14 percent so far this year.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who came
for the Baltic Sea States Summit, played down any worries on
Wednesday about the European Union's single currency.
 ""The euro is a strong and stable currency,"" he told
reporters after meeting Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite.

 By Brian Love 
 PARIS, June 2 (Reuters) - G20 finance ministers will discuss
the need to reduce debt without stifling economic recovery when
they meet in South Korea this week, French Economy Minister
Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday.
 Lagarde said the June 4-5 meeting in the port city of Busan
would focus on three areas: regulation of the financial sector,
the long-term balance of the global economy and, in the nearer
term, the need to reconcile growth promotion and debt reduction.
 ""How do we pursue necessary fiscal consolidation -- that's
to say budget consolidation or reduction of deficits -- and on
the other hand support economic growth? That's the whole
difficulty of the exercise,"" she told a news conference.
 ""Fiscal consolidation must be considered imperative. It's an
imperative that must be reconciled with support for growth which
we know is fragile at this moment in time,"" Lagarde said.
 Within the G20 group, debt reduction is more of a pressing
issue for the developed countries than emerging ones such as
China.
 The IMF expects total G20 public debt to rise to 79 percent
of gross domestic product in 2011 from 61 percent of GDP in
2007, before the financial crisis prompted a global recession.
 That masks a forecast debt rise in advanced G20 economies
from 78 to 109 percent in the same period, versus no rise at all
in emerging G20 economies, where debt is much lower and in fact
seen dipping marginally, from 37 percent in 2007 to 36 percent
of GDP in 2011, according to recent IMF estimates.
 Some officials said ahead of the G20 meeting that emerging
market countries and some of the developed economies feared that
if everyone rushed into heavy-handed fiscal consolidation at the
same time, the post-recession recovery could suffer excessively.
 
 AUSTERITY PUSH
 Mindful of the European debt crisis that forced euro zone
governments to rescue Greece and commit 750 billion euros to a
market stabilisation plan last month, Lagarde was keen to show
European countries would not let up on debt control efforts.
 She brushed off a question from one journalist about concern
in some G20 capitals that Germany was announcing fresh austerity
when it was one of the European countries with fewer holes in
its public finances to fill.
 Lagarde said it was all a matter of ""finetuning"" and that
there should be a carefully measured removal of the economic
stimulus that governments put in place to combat recession.
 ""When I said we should withdraw from stimulus programmes on
the tips of our toes, (when I said) that it's all in the
finetuning -- that's what it is all about,"" she said.
 ""We need to be careful to avoid brutal shifts.""
 On the euro zone specifically, Lagarde said: ""We're doing
everything to restore confidence.""
 The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development this month raised its forecast for global growth to
4.6 percent in 2010 and 4.5 percent in 2011, after a GDP
contraction of 0.9 percent in 2009.
 That recovery would be led by China and other emerging
economies but remained risk-prone, primarily because of the
inflated debts of advanced economies but also the difficulty of
managing overheating dangers in emerging economic powers such as
China and India.
 The G20 spans all of the large industrialised economies of
North America, Europe and Japan but also a host of others
including the major rising economies such as China, India and
Brazil.

 By Jan Strupczewski 
 BRUSSELS, June 2 (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices rose
more than expected in April driven mainly by more expensive
energy, but low growth of consumer goods prices suggested the
underlying price pressures remained muted.
 The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices
at factory gates in the 16 countries using the euro rose 0.9
percent month-on-month for a 2.8 percent yar-on-year increase.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7 percent
monthly gain and a 2.5 percent annual rise.
 Producer prices play an important role for rate-setters as a
precursor to consumer price developments. The European Central
Bank wants to keep consumer inflation below, but close to 2
percent over the medium term.
 Euro zone consumer inflation was 1.6 percent year-on-year in
May, Eurostat estimated on Monday.
 ""While the ECB will note the rise in intermediate producer
prices in April, the data overall is unlikely to fundamentally
alter the bank's view that euro zone consumer price inflation
will remain subdued over the two-year policy horizon,"" said
Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 ""It looks increasingly likely that the ECB will keep
interest rates down at 1.00 percent not only through 2010 but
deep into 2011. Inflation continues to be pushed up primarily by
higher energy prices while underlying price pressures still
appear muted,"" he said. 
 Without volatile energy and construction prices, or what
some economists call core producer price inflation, prices rose
only 0.5 percent month-on-month and 1.0 percent year-on-year.
 Eurostat said energy prices jumped 1.9 percent on the month
and 7.7 percent year-on-year while intermediate goods prices
rose 1.3 percent month-on-month and 2.7 percent in annual terms.
 But prices of durable and non-durable consumer goods rose
only 0.1 percent on the month and non-durable consumer goods,
which means mainly food, even fell 0.4 percent year-on-year.
 ""Prices for capital goods, durable consumer goods and
non-durable goods all remained muted in April suggesting that
price pressures are still being absorbed as they move up the
supply chain,"" said Archer.
 ""Still muted consumer spending across the euro zone suggests
that the rise in producer prices will be largely absorbed by
retailers,"" he said.

 Coffee bean shipments through the main coffee port of
Panjang in Bandar Lampung fell to 18,112.1 tonnes in May from
29,079.2 tonnes in the same period a year ago.
 Heavy rains meant the main harvest was delayed from March

 ""Farmers can pick the cherries but they can't dry them so
they prefer to wait for sunnier weather,"" said Muchtar Lutfie,

 Lutfie said supplies of coffee beans have slowed to a
trickle from the highlands in west Lampung.
 Robusta, a more bitter-tasting variety used in instant

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday after
the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, while
the euro was weak after European Central Bank board member
Christian Noyer said the currency was not ""unusually"" low.
 The yen hit a two-week low against the dollar after Hatoyama
and his powerful No. 2 resigned to try and boost the ruling
party's faltering fortunes in an election next month. His likely
successor, Finance Minister Naoto Kan, is seen taking a tougher
stance in fighting yen strength.
 The euro meanwhile hovered close to a four-year low versus
the dollar after Noyer told a German business daily that the
single currency's exchange rate against the dollar was at around
a 10-year average, which is ""by no means an unusually low
level"".
 The euro clawed back some losses, however, after government
sources in Brazil, India, Japan and South Korea said they would
not stop investing in the weakening currency.
 Traders also said investors were wary of renewing short euro
positions after taking a hit from the currency's sharp upswing
on Tuesday following its slide to a four-year low of $1.2110 on
trading platform EBS, though sentiment was still negative.
 ""The big theme is still one of a weak and vulnerable euro.
Very few investors are ready to put on long euro/dollar
positions, and any spikes are due to profit taking on short
positions,"" said Niels Christensen, currency strategist at
Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""The political situation in Japan could give a reason for
brief yen selling, but it is likely to be limited because risk
aversion is still very much on the table,"" he added.
 At 0807 GMT, the euro was steady against the dollar at
$1.2224, looking increasingly vulnerable to another sell-off
against the dollar on mounting concern that the euro zone's debt
crisis is spreading to its banking system.
Against the yen the euro gained 0.7 percent to 112.10 yen,
while the dollar rose 0.7 percent to 91.61 yen.
 ""The market may become cautious over the possibility of
government moves to restrain yen strength because Kan has shown
his preference for a weaker yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief
FX strategist in Japan at Barclays Capital. 
 ""But given no signs that business leaders have complained to
the current government about a higher yen, the chance of
Japanese currency intervention remains very low,"" Yamamoto said.
 
 STERLING GAINS
 Sterling outperformed, hitting an 18-month high versus the
euro, after British insurer Prudential said it was withdrawing
from a $35.5 billion deal to buy American International Group
Inc's Asian life insurance business. 
 Traders said Prudential had put in place a series of
currency hedges, selling sterling against the dollar, when the
initial bid was announced in March and these positions would
need to be unwound.
 Against the dollar, sterling gained 0.7 percent to $1.4746.
 The U.S. dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of
currencies to 86.744, hovering not far below a 15-month high as
market players looked ahead to key U.S. jobs data on Friday
expected to give more evidence of a strengthening economy.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday,
unsettled by the Japanese prime minister's resignation, while
world equities and commodity prices slipped on concerns about
the impact of the euro zone debt crisis on global growth.
 The euro steadied, helped by comments from some of the
world's biggest central banks that they would not stop investing
in the single currency. It was little affected by a report on
state-owned Iranian TV that Iran would sell 45 billion euros of
reserves to buy dollars and gold. [ID:nLDE65115U]
 But there were still signs of tension in euro zone assets.
The premium investors demand to buy peripheral government bonds
rather than euro zone benchmark Bunds rose.
 The U.S. currency rose to a two-week high of 91.97 yen
, according to Reuters data, as investors sold due to
fears over political instability and the fact that Yukio
Hatoyama's expected replacement, Finance Minister Naoto Kan, has
previously advocated a weak yen.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying he wanted
the yen to weaken more and that most businesses were in favour
of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. Since then he has mostly
toed the ministry line that stable currencies are desirable and
markets should set foreign exchange levels.
 ""If the position does fall to Kan, then the bias will be
towards a slightly weaker yen,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at nabCapital.
 The resignation news had also weighed on Tokyo's shares,
with the Nikkei average <.N225> down 1.1 percent.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> slipped 0.6 percent, on the back of weaker
markets in Asia and Europe. The index fell nearly 10 percent
last month, its worst monthly loss since February 2009.
In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index lost 0.6
percent, with oil major BP  falling 1.9 percent to extend
the previous session's 13 percent slump.
 The U.S. government has launched a widely expected criminal
and civil investigation into BP's massive oil spill, ratcheting
up pressure on the beleaguered British oil company.
 
 EURO STEADY
 The euro  steadied at $1.2226 after rising to around
$1.2249 after official sources in Brazil, India, Japan, Russia
and South Korea said that there were no alternatives to the
dollar and the euro as reserve currencies in the near term.
[ID:nTOE650069]
 The euro is down more than 14 percent against the dollar
this year on fears stemming from Greece's sovereign debt problem
and possible contagion risks which sparked a sell-off in
financial markets around the world.
 The weakness in the single currency has raised concerns
whether central banks around the world, especially those surplus
rich countries, will trim their holdings of the euro.
 However, the Italian/German 10-year bond yield spread

 TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister is likely
to skip the June 4-5 meeting of Group of 20 financial leaders in
Busan, South Korea, a ministry official said, following the
resignation of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama on Wednesday.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan is viewed by many in the markets
as frontrunner to succeed Hatoyama, who quit to try to boost the
ruling party's prospects in an election expected next month, less
than a year after sweeping to power with promises of change.
 ""Considering the schedule, it may be difficult,""
Parliamentary Secretary of Finance Hiroshi Ogushi told reporters,
when asked whether Kan would attend the weekend meeting as
initially planned.
 Another official said the ministry will decide on Thursday
who will attend on behalf of the finance minister.
 Kan is likely to run in a Democratic Party vote to become its
leader after Hatoyama resigned, broadcaster NTV reported on
Wednesday.
 The next Democratic Party leader will be the new prime
minister by virtue of the party's majority in parliament's
powerful lower house.
 Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20
wealthy and developing economies gather in South Korea this week
to grapple with Europe's debt crisis, financial reforms and
efforts to rebalance the global economy.
 The weekend meeting in the port city of Busan will prepare a
summit of G20 leaders in Toronto on June 26-27.

 TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yukio
Hatoyama and his powerful ruling party No.2 quit on Wednesday to
try to boost the party's fortunes in an election next month, less
than a year after sweeping to power with promises of change.
 The political turmoil could delay efforts to thrash out plans
set to be announced this month to cut the country's public debt,
which stands at about 200 percent of GDP, and a strategy to
engineer economic growth in an ageing society.
 But if, as many expect, fiscally conservative Finance
Minister Naoto Kan takes the helm, that could raise the chances
of bolder steps to rein in debt, including a pledge to consider
raising the 5 percent sales tax.
 Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) made history with
a landslide election win last year, promising to change how Japan
is governed after more than 50 years of cosy ties among
bureaucrats, companies and lawmakers under the Liberal Democrats.
 But after eight months of indecision and broken promises, the
63-year-old Hatoyama -- nicknamed ""The Alien"" for his quirky
comments -- bowed to pressure from his party to quit ahead of an
election for the upper house of parliament expected in July that
it must win to smooth policymaking.
 An election loss would not oust the DPJ-led government given
its majority in the more powerful lower house, but the ruling
bloc needs a majority to keep legislation from being stalled.
 With tears in his eyes, Hatoyama told party lawmakers that he
and party secretary-general Ichiro Ozawa would resign.
 Hatoyama later defended his decision, saying that without
public support, the government could not meet its goals.
 ""So I decided that my resignation would serve this country's
interests,"" he told reporters.
 Hatoyama, who becomes Japan's fourth straight leader to leave
office after a year or less, told reporters later.
 Hatoyama's ratings had nosedived on voter doubts about his
leadership, while Ozawa's image as an old-style powerbroker
pulling strings behind the scenes had also eroded public support.
 FINANCE MINISTER KAN NEXT?
 Kan, seen as the frontrunner to replace Hatoyama, told
reporters he would run in a vote among DPJ lawmakers on Friday.
 ""Unfortunately there wasn't enough time under Prime Minister
Hatoyama to meet the expectations the people had when they voted
for us last autumn, so I want to keep trying,"" he said.
 A new cabinet is then likely to be formed on Monday, quicker
than many had thought.
 The yen slipped to 91.78 per dollar from around 91.10 on the
news. The Nikkei share average, which initially gained as the yen
weakened, later ended down 1.1 percent, and bond futures edged
higher.
 The likely selection of Kan, who made his name battling
bureaucrats during a stint as health minister, would be welcome
by investors and voters worried about Japan's public debt,
although lawmakers up for re-election will probably be cautious.
 ""Whether he gets his way at this juncture is hard to tell,""
said Koichi Nakano, a Sophia University professor.
 The short-tempered Kan has in the past pressed the Bank of
Japan to do more to fight deflation and been positive about
raising the 5 percent sales tax in the future to fund bulging
social welfare costs.
 ""If Finance Minister Kan takes over, it would be welcome news
for the JGB market because Kan is more proactive about fiscal
discipline and about raising the consumption tax than any other
cabinet minister,"" said Hirokata Kusaba, economist at Mizuho
Research Institute.
 Kan surprised markets earlier this year by saying that he
wanted the yen to weaken more and that most businesses were in
favour of a dollar/yen rate around 95 yen. Since then he has
mostly toed the ministry line that stable currencies are
desirable and markets should set foreign exchange levels.
 The BOJ, which has called for a credible government plan to
rein in Japan's huge public debt, is worried a policy stalemate
will delay fiscal reform. But the political vacuum will give the
central bank breathing space and ease government pressure for
further action on deflation, at least until after the election.
 ELECTION BOUNCE
 Some analysts said the change of the party's top two leaders
would give the Democrats a boost before the election, but most
expect the party and its small ally, the New People's Party,
still to fall short of a majority in the lower house.
 ""A big reason for the falling support was the Hatoyama-Ozawa
duo,"" said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior fellow at the Tokyo
Foundation think tank. ""Now that they have gotten rid of both,
they can appeal to voters that they can govern better.""
 Optimists say a new post-election coalition might even be
more consistent on policies, such as the need to rein in debt.
 But not all voters were impressed, and some are likely either
to cast their ballots for one of the new small parties recently
formed by Liberal Democratic Party rebels -- or stay home.
 ""This is making me lean towards neither the Liberal
Democratic Party nor the Democratic Party. I might end up having
no party to vote for,"" said Yoshimasa Muroi, a consultant.
 A change in leadership is unlikely to alter Japan's ambitious
goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent from 1990
levels by 2020, but could delay a law needed to implement it.
 Hatoyama took office in September with ratings of over 70
percent from voters hoping the party would make good on promises
to cut waste, pry policy control away from bureaucrats, and put
more money in consumers' hands to boost domestic demand.
 But doubts over his leadership skills helped erode the
government's approval ratings, with one poll showing support at
just 17 percent after he failed to keep a campaign pledge to move
a U.S. airbase off Okinawa island in southern Japan.
 Japan's new leader will also face a tough task keeping ties
with Washington on track, since Hatoyama's deal with Washington
to shift the airbase to northern Okinawa is staunchly opposed by
local residents and will be hard to implement.

 By Leika Kihara and Ana Nicolaci da Costa
 TOKYO/BRASILIA, June 2 (Reuters) - Some of the world's
richest central banks will not stop investing in the euro,
supporting its reserve status, despite the sovereign debt
crisis hammering the euro zone's currency, government sources
said.
 Official sources in Brazil, India, Russia, Japan and South
Korea told Reuters in separate interviews that their reserve
currency portfolios were too big to change without affecting
markets, and there were no alternatives in the near term to the
liquidity of the euro  and the U.S. dollar.
 The four countries control nearly a quarter of the world's
$8.09 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.
 Global market sensitivity to reserve management was
highlighted last week after the Financial Times reported that
China was reviewing its euro zone bond holdings because of
growing concerns about gaping deficits in countries such as
Greece and Portugal.
 A Chinese government official told Reuters last week after
the report that China's goal of diversifying its reserves will
not change.
 The euro fell and stocks skidded, but later recouped some
of their losses after China said on Thursday the report was
groundless, adding that Europe will remain a major target of
its enormous portfolio. [ID:nTOE64Q04P]
 Like China, sources in other countries told Reuters they
were not going to walk away from the euro.
 ""Even if the dollar or the euro is in trouble, is there
anywhere else to invest? Not really. There needs to be a
certain degree of liquidity,"" said a senior Japanese government
official, who asked not to be identified because of the
political sensitivity of the issue.
 ""Currencies of countries with capital controls won't work
too. That leaves us with very few options,"" the official said.
 Japan's $1.05 trillion in reserves is second only to
China's $2.45 trillion.
 The comments suggest G20 finance ministers and central
bankers meeting in South Korea on June 4-5 will try to bring a
message of reassurance and stability to financial markets,
after the euro  fell 10 percent since April to four-year
lows against the dollar.

 Sources in Japan and India, though, were cautious about
whether some European countries could do enough to prevent
their deficits from becoming structural and if the crisis would
spread to other countries.
 ""If Europe fails to make real efforts to alleviate market
concerns, it's no use begging reserve managers not to sell the
euro,"" another senior Japanese government official said.
 NOT SPECULATORS
 Few of the large reserve managers reveal the composition of
their portfolios, though many economists believe central banks
have been slowly shifting some of their dollar holdings to
euros to diversify risks.
 Brazil's central bank has 6-6.5 percent of its $249.5
billion official reserves in euros, a Brazilian government
source said.
 The euro zone sovereign debt crisis will not affect the
make up of Brazil's foreign reserves because the composition is
based on the country's private and public debt, said the
source, who did not want to be identified in order to speak
more freely.
 ""If we end that policy, we will become a speculator. We
will be betting that a certain currency will strengthen or
weaken. We don't do that,"" the source added.
 ""We, therefore, will not touch the euro, yen, dollar mix.""
 Some investors and economists have postulated that the dire
outlook for Europe may push large central banks to look at
other currencies, such as the Canadian dollar  or
Australian dollar.
 However, all of the sources interviewed stressed their
foreign reserves were kept to maintain macroeconomic and
exchange rate stability and the euro still achieved that goal
for now.
 A source in Russia's financial circles said reserve
managers will not be able to move into Australian dollar-assets
en masse because there just was not enough assets.
 ""That is not just true for the Australian dollar, it is
true for other currencies, apart from euro and dollar -- you
cannot compare any other currency to them,"" the source said.
 Lee Eung-baek, director general of the Bank of Korea's
reserve investment office, said there was very limited room for
using any other currency than the dollar and euro as a widely
held store of value.
 ""There are few alternatives, even when looking on a
long-term basis,"" Lee said. ""There can hardly be more than two
or three reserve currencies.""
 YUAN A VERY DISTANT PROSPECT
 The Bank of Korea has said 63 percent of its reserves were
dollar dominated at the end of 2009.
 China's yuan , which is still not convertible for
purely financial purposes, is seen as a very distant prospect
and will unlikely be an established reserve currency within the
next several decades, Lee added.
 The Reserve Bank of India does not have significant euro
exposure, though there have been some ""adjustments"" of the
holdings to protect the portfolio, said an official with direct
knowledge of India's reserve management.
 A senior Indian finance ministry source said it was too
early to consider a change in the portfolio's structure,
though, since the euro itself was not fundamentally threatened.
 ""It's not easy to shift out of currencies like the U.S.
dollar, sterling and the euro overnight and unless this crisis
spreads, I don't think there is any need for that,"" the source
said.

 * Finance Minister Kan viewed as likely successor
 * Euro falls after ECB's Noyer says euro not unusually low
 * Focus shifts to U.S. labour market reports
 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, June 2 (Reuters) - The yen fell on Wednesday after
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's resignation stoked
expectations that his likely successor, the finance minister,
would take a tougher stance in fighting yen strength.
 Hedge funds jumped on the resignation news to drive the yen
lower, but the drop soon petered out after the euro fell
following comments from European Central Bank board member
Christian Noyer.
 Noyer said in an interview with the German business daily
Handelsblatt that the exchange rate of the euro against the
dollar is not unusually low. His remarks came a day after the
euro hit a four-year low against the dollar.
 The yen dropped to a two-week low against the dollar as
investors sold on the view that political instability would make
the economy more dependent on the Bank of Japan and its easy
monetary policy.
 Market players speculated that Finance Minister Kan, who
doubles as deputy prime minister, would be the likely successor
to Hatoyama, which in turn could make investors cautious about
pushing the yen higher.
 ""The market may become cautious over the possibility of
government moves to restrain yen strength because Kan has shown
his preference for a weaker yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief
FX strategist in Japan at Barclays Capital.
 ""But given no signs that business leaders have complained to
the current government about a higher yen, the chance of Japanese
currency intervention remains very low,"" Yamamoto said.
 The euro looked increasingly vulnerable to another sell-off
amid mounting concern that the euro zone's debt crisis is
spreading to its banking system.
 The dollar held firm near a 15-month high against a basket of
currencies as market players shifted their focus to reports on
the U.S. labour market due later this week, which are expected to
show a surge in employment and a slight fall in the jobless rate.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 91.78 yen on
trading platform EBS, the highest since May 20, from around 91.10
yen before the first media report on Hatoyama's resignation.
 It later trimmed gains to stand at 91.33 yen, up 0.4 percent
from late New York trade on Tuesday, after the Nikkei share
average index turned lower and Asian stocks fell.
 The ruling Democratic Party is struggling to revive its
chances in an upper house election expected in July, less than a
year after sweeping to power with promises of change.
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to 111.72 yen, but also trimming
earlier gains with investors believing concerns over the euro
zone's debt crisis will outweigh any impact from political
instability on Japan's economy in the wake of Hatoyama's
resignation.
 Traders said euro selling pressure was likely to continue as
the market grows more confident that the U.S. economy and its
banking system are in much better shape than their European
counterparts.
 ""Given the deep-seated bad debts at euro zone banks, this
looks like just the beginning of the euro's long-term slide,""
said a sales trader at a Japanese trust bank.
 ""Reaching parity in euro/dollar in the long-run is becoming
increasingly realistic.""
 The euro edged down 0.2 percent to $1.2209, shedding earlier
rises. A senior prop trader for a Japanese bank said market
players are less motivated to take big positions in the euro
after taking a hit from the currency's sharp upswing on Tuesday.
 The single European currency hit a 1-½ year low against the
pound at 82.80 pence. Sterling gained versus the dollar and the
euro after British insurer Prudential said it was withdrawing
from a $35.5 billion deal to buy American International Group
Inc's Asian life insurance business AIA.
 The euro made a brief rebound above $1.23 the previous day
after earlier dropping to a four-year low of $1.2110 on trading
platform EBS.
 It had succumbed to selling pressure on concerns about bad
loans held by euro zone banks after the European Central Bank
warned this week that euro zone banks faced up to 195 billion
euros in a ""second wave"" of potential loan losses over the next
18 months due to the financial crisis.
 Talk of a double no-touch option with perimeters at $1.2100
and $1.2500 may also keep the euro range bound against the
dollar. Market players said the option expires at the end of the
week when U.S. non-farm payroll numbers will be released.
 Technical analysts noted that the euro's break below key
support at $1.2135, a 50 percent retracement of the 2000-2008
rally, had accelerated the currency's slide on Tuesday. A daily
close below $1.2135 would suggest further downside, they said.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against other six major currencies, was at 86.910, near its
15-month high of 87.473 hit the previous day.

 By Jane Lee and Farah Master
 (Updates throughout)
 SHANGHAI, June 2 (Reuters) - Canada expects its economy to
grow by 3.3 percent in 2010, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said
on Wednesday, adding that inflation remained a concern and might
eventually force additional interest rate hikes.
 ""There is no firm plan to go forward this year with respect
to interest rates. We just have to watch and wait and see,""
Flaherty told Reuters Insider in an interview in Shanghai.
 ""We have a relatively modest situation in Canada, but
interest rates have been very low. They couldn't really be any
lower, so people should expect over time that interest rates will
go up and that there are inflationary pressures over time.""
 He said Canada's gross domestic product was expected to grow
3.3 percent this year, up from an expectation of about 2.9-3.0
percent previously.
 The Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate on Tuesday,
the first G7 industrialised economy to do so after the global
recession, but it said the European debt crisis made its next
move highly unpredictable.
 The rate hike, to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent, was a
response to two quarters of extraordinarily strong growth.
 Flaherty added that the euro zone's debt crisis was still
volatile but noted it had not changed pressure on China to let
the yuan become more flexible.
 ""In order to increase trade and create wealth, flexibility in
currencies has proven to be beneficial for those currencies that
permit flexibilities.""
 EURO CRISIS TOP PRIORITY AT G20
 Flaherty, who was in Shanghai to visit Canada's pavilion at
the World Expo, said the euro zone crisis would be the top topic
of discussion at the G20 summit, with key issues including
monetary policy, sustainable growth and financial sector reform.
 ""The concern is that Europeans make sure they fix their
banks, to put it bluntly,"" Flaherty said.
 ""Those countries that are vulnerable need to proceed with
fiscal consolidation plans, get them done, get whatever
parliamentary approvals they need so Europe can get back on a
firm footing.""
 Flaherty added that while Canada was in a strong economic
position compared to its G7 counterparts it would continue to
monitor Canadian household debts.
 ""We watch Canadian household debt carefully. It is
manageable. There is no evidence of a housing bubble in Canada.""

 The yen dropped to a two-week low against the dollar as
investors sold on the view that political instability would make
the economy more dependent on the Bank of Japan and its easy
monetary policy.
 Market players speculated that Finance Minister Naoto Kan,
who doubles as deputy prime minister, would be the likely
successor to Hatoyama, which in turn could make investors
cautious about pushing the yen higher.
 ""The market may become cautious over the possibility of
government moves to restrain yen strength because Kan has shown
his preference for a weaker yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief
FX strategist in Japan at Barclays Capital.
 ""But given no signs that business leaders have complained to
the current government about a higher yen, the chance of Japanese
currency intervention remains very low,"" Yamamoto said.
 The euro was treading water but it looked increasingly
vulnerable to another sell-off amid mounting concern that the
euro zone's debt crisis is spreading to its banking system.
 The dollar held firm near a 15-month high against a basket of
currencies as market players shifted their focus to reports on
the U.S. labour markets due later this week, which are expected
to show a surge in employment and a slight fall in unemployment.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 91.78 yen on
trading platform EBS, the highest since May 20, from around 91.10
yen before the first media report on Hatoyama's resignation.
 It stood at 91.66 yen, up 0.8 percent from late New York
trade on Tuesday.
 The ruling Democratic Party is struggling to revive its
chances in an upper house election expected in July, and Hatoyama
becomes the fourth Japanese leader to leave office in a year or
less.
 The euro rose 1 percent to 112.33 yen, as investors sold the
yen further after earlier reversing their safe-haven buying of
the previous day.
 But traders said euro selling pressure was likely to continue
as the market grows more confident that the U.S. economy and its
banking system are in much better shape than their European
counterparts.
 ""Given the deep-seated bad debts at euro zone banks, this
looks like just the beginning of the euro's long-term slide,""
said a sales trader at a Japanese trust bank.
 ""Reaching parity in euro/dollar in the long-run is becoming
increasingly realistic.""
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.2254, helped by its gains
against the yen.
 The single European currency hit a 1-½ year low against the
pound at 83.08 pence, but a senior prop trader for a Japanese
bank said market players are less motivated to take big positions
in the euro after taking a hit from the currency's sharp upswing
on Tuesday.
 The euro made a brief rebound above $1.23 the previous day
after earlier dropping to a four-year low of $1.2110 on trading
platform EBS.
 It had succumbed to selling pressure on concerns about bad
loans held by euro zone banks after The European Central Bank
warned this week that euro zone banks faced up to 195 billion
euros in a ""second wave"" of potential loan losses over the next
18 months due to the financial crisis.
 At one stage on Tuesday, the euro rose as
stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing and construction
spending data encouraged some investors to dip out of the
perceived safety of the U.S. dollar and the yen, though that
positive sentiment waned as trade wound down in New York.
 Talk of a double no-touch option with perimeters at $1.2100
and $1.2500 may also keep the euro range bound against the
dollar. Market players said the option expires at the end of the
week when U.S. non-farm payroll numbers will be released.
 The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against other six major currencies, was at 86.675, near its
15-month high of 87.473 hit the previous day.
 Some traders said comments from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden
on Tuesday on the upcoming May U.S. employment report were
encouraging for the dollar. Biden predicted the jobs report would
show a much larger number of jobs created than in the previous
month, when 290,000 jobs were added.

Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said he intends to resign,
prompting investors to sell the currency on the view that

the Bank of Japan and its easy monetary policy.
 The dollar rose to 91.57 yen from around 91.10 yen. The yen
fell after public broadcaster NHK said Hatoyama intended to

saying he would step down.
 The fall in the yen helped the benchmark Nikkei share average

 ""But if a young person is chosen as the new prime minister,

478,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2010 05:39PM ET</span>",Republicans urge Obama outline plans for trade deals," WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Republican senators urged
President Barack Obama on Tuesday to lay out a ""specific
timeline"" for winning approval of long-delayed free trade
agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea.
 ""The immediate consideration of these FTAs has never been
so important,"" Senator Orrin Hatch and 15 of his colleagues
said in a letter touting the ""significant"" job gains that could
come from the pacts.
 The deals have been on Obama's desk since he took office in
January 2008 and he appears unlikely to send them to Congress
before the November mid-term elections.
 They were negotiated during the tenure of his predecessor,
George W. Bush, who was unable to persuade the Democratic-run
Congress to ratify the pacts.
 Obama has said he wants to fix problems with the deals, but
has resisted setting any deadlines for action.
 ""We respectfully request that your administration provide,
on an expedited basis, to Korea, Colombia and Panama a
well-defined and finite list of those particular outstanding
issues to be accomplished and provide Congress with a proposed
specific timeline for the enactment of these FTAs once those
articulated matters are resolved,"" the senators said.
 They argued quick action is needed because the United
States risks losing exports to competitors such as the European
Union and Canada, which have struck their own trade deals with
one or more of the three countries.
 Many Democrats oppose the agreements, making it unlikely
Obama could win their approval without a major and divisive
fight within his own party.
 The Obama administration says it wants South Korea to make
changes to its agreement that would open the Korean market to
more American cars.
 It has called on Colombia to do more to stop violence
against trade unionists and to prosecute those responsible.
 It has pressed Panama to reform its bank secrecy laws and
strengthen its labor regime.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 1 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar fell
against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, hit by global economic
fears and the failure of the Bank of Canada to provide a clear
signal that more interest rate increases were in the works
after it raised its key rate by a quarter point.
 The Bank of Canada became on Tuesday the first Group of
Seven central bank to raise interest rates since the financial
crisis began, pulling up its benchmark overnight rate to 0.50
percent, a move highly anticipated by the market.
 But the central bank gave no indication that more hikes
were on the way, causing the Canadian dollar to slump.
[ID:nN01103957] [ID:nN01264788]
 Currencies usually strengthen as interest rates rise as
higher rates attract capital flows.
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0540 to the
U.S. dollar, or 94.88 U.S. cents, down from Monday's close of
C$1.0435 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.83 U.S. cents.
 ""The currency was priced for a hike, so the market wasn't
disappointed from that perspective. Quite simply it was the
accompanying guidance that was somewhat more dovish than
expected,"" said Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign
exchange at National Bank Financial.
 ""Much of the volatility in the Canadian dollar has come on
the back of global factors again.""
 Global risk sentiment was hit by a warning from the
European Central Bank on European Union public finances, which
overcame support provided by better-than-expected U.S. April
construction and May manufacturing data. [MKTS/GLOB]
[ID:nN01112488] [ID:nLAG006303]
 Pressure from oil prices, which fell nearly 2 percent to
below $73 per barrel on worries about Chinese and European
demand, made sure the commodity-linked currency stayed on the
negative side of break-even at the end of the day.
 BONDS RISE
 Canadian bond prices were higher across the yield curve
due to strong risk aversion in markets and uncertainty about
the Bank of Canada's interest-rates path.
 Most of Canada's primary securities dealers, however,
maintained their interest rate forecasts for 2010 even though
the Bank of Canada warned against betting that it would embark
on an uninterrupted campaign of rate increases.
[ID:nN01126499]
 All but one of 12 dealers forecast 25 basis point rate
increases in July, September and October. The majority also saw
a 1.50 percent year-end rate, implying a quarter-percentage
point rate rise at each of the bank's four remaining
policy-setting dates.
 ""This is the main forecast but, of course, we see the
possibility to have a pause depending on the uncertainty in the
world markets,"" said Benoit Durocher, senior economist at
Desjardins Economics.
 The forecast for a rate increase in July is in line with
market expectations as reflected in yields on overnight index
swaps, which suggest there is about 66 percent chance of a 25
basis point hike at the bank's next announcement date.

 The two-year Canadian government bond  jumped 31
Canadian cents to yield 1.702 percent, and the 10-year bond
 gained 60 Canadian cents to yield 3.284 percent.
 The Canadian two-year bond was 106 basis points above the
U.S. two-year yield, compared with 93.2 basis points on
Monday.

plans to sell C$600 million in bonds maturing in 2039.

 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a fresh
four-year on low Tuesday after the European Central Bank warned
the region's banks may face a new wave of losses, and U.S.
stocks plunged as the government launched a criminal probe into
BP's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
 U.S. Treasury bond prices rose as fears of hefty writedowns
by European banks sparked new worries about global economic
recovery and unleashed demand for safe-haven assets such as
government debt and gold.
 Risky assets such as the euro and stocks rose earlier in
the day following better-than-expected U.S. construction and
manufacturing data. They gave up gains on fears the euro zone's
debt crisis would spread into its banking system.
 The ECB cautioned on Monday that euro zone banks could face
a ""second wave"" of potential loan losses totaling 195 billion
euros ($239 billion) over the next 19 months due to the
financial crisis.
 U.S. and UK financial markets were closed Monday for
national holidays.
 ""The ECB warning Monday set the stage for euro selling,""
said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto. ""Markets remain jittery and overall risk
sentiment is bearish.""
 After May marked the most volatile month of trading since
the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' collapse in late 2008,
investors focused on concerns euro zone growth would slow as
the region struggles to rein in debt. That could, in turn,
reduce demand for exports from economies like China and slow
production there.
 Concerns over another crisis in the banking sector were
compounded by data signaling slower manufacturing growth in
Europe and China. In the United States, a revival in the
factory sector due to overseas demand and inventory restocking
has helped lead an economic rebound over the past three
quarters.
 ""Treasuries and the dollar remain the safe haven because
the euro zone problem will not go away any time soon,"" said
Frank Cholly Sr., a senior market strategist at Lind Waldock in
Chicago.

the U.S. manufacturing sector expanded for a tenth straight
month but at a slower pace than in April, which was the highest
in almost six years. Meanwhile employment rose to its best
level in six years, according to an industry report.
 The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 2.7
percent, and investment in private construction surged 2.9
percent, the largest increase since July 2004. Also, the
Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index expanded
more than expected in May.

 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a fresh
four-year low against the dollar on Tuesday, on signs the euro
zone's debt crisis is spreading to its banking system.
 The European Central Bank warned on Monday that euro zone
banks face up to 195 billion euros in a ""second wave"" of
potential loan losses over the next 18 months due to the
financial crisis. The ECB said it had increased purchases of
euro zone government bonds.
 Stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing and construction
spending data momentarily boosted stocks and encouraged some
investors to briefly leave the perceived safety of the U.S.
dollar and the yen, though the positive sentiment waned as the
global session wound down in New York.
 ""The ECB warning on Monday set the stage for euro selling,""
said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto. ""Markets remain jittery and overall risk
sentiment is bearish.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.5
percent against the dollar at $1.2240 after dropping earlier to
a four-year low of $1.2112, according to Reuters data. It fell
to $1.2110 on electronic trading platform EBS.
 The single currency rose as high as $1.2353 as U.S. stocks
advanced in the aftermath of reports showing the manufacturing
sector expanded in May for a 10th straight month and April
construction spending recorded the largest monthly increase in
nearly 10 years.
 The focus will now shift to reports on the U.S labor
markets due later this week, and euro selling pressure is
likely to continue, analysts said.
 STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS, BOC
 The euro closed Monday with its sixth consecutive monthly
decline against the dollar, the single currency's longest
losing sequence since shortly after its inception in 1999. The
euro fell over 7 percent against the dollar in May.
 Growth concerns were heightened as a survey showed that
euro zone manufacturing activity expanded in May at a
considerably more sluggish pace than April's 46-month high.
 ""The data just confirmed some of the structural problems
Europe is facing,"" said Strauss at RBC.
 Traders said euro/dollar stop-losses were triggered under
the previous low at $1.2143, while technical analysts
highlighted a break below key support at $1.2135, the 50

 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a four-year
low on Tuesday on worries the euro zone's debt crisis is
spreading to its banking system, and the price of U.S.
Treasuries and gold rose as investors sought safe havens.
 U.S. stocks bounced between negative and positive
territory, hurt by a warning from the European Central Bank on
the region's public finances but buttressed by
better-than-expected U.S. construction and manufacturing data.
 The European Central Bank warned on Monday that euro zone
banks could face another 195 billion euros $239 billion in a
""second wave"" of potential loan losses over the next 19 months
due to the the financial crisis. For more, see [ID:nLAG006303]

 After May marked the most volatile month of trading since
the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' collapse in late 2008,
investors focused on concerns that growth would slow in a euro
zone struggling to rein in debt, in turn reducing demand for
exports from economies like China, slowing production there.
 Concerns over another crisis in the banking sector were
compounded by data signaling slowing manufacturing growth in
Europe and China. In the United States, a revival in the
factory sector due to overseas demand and inventory restocking
has helped to lead an economic rebound over the past three
quarters.
 ""Treasuries and the dollar remain the safe haven because
the euro zone problem will not go away any time soon,"" said
Frank Cholly Sr., a senior market strategist at Lind Waldock in
Chicago.
 European stocks eked out a small gain, reversing losses
that had dragged the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
down nearly 2 percent. The strong U.S. data helped to ease
investors' worries about the global economic recovery.
 BP  tumbled 13.1 percent after its attempt to plug
the worst oil spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico
failed.
 U.S. government bond prices rose with the benchmark 10-year
U.S. Treasury note  up 4/32, with the yield at
3.2867 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 1/32, with the yield at 0.7816 percent. The 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond  was up 10/32, with the yield at 4.198
percent.
 The Institute for Supply Management said U.S. manufacturing
sector expanded for a tenth straight month but at a slower pace
than in April, which was the highest in almost six years
[ID:nEAP101100]. Meanwhile employment rose to its best level in
six years, according to an industry report [ID:nWEN5329].
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 40.58

a slowing economy.
 The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 2.7
percent, and investment in private construction surged 2.9

more than expected in May. For details, see [ID:nN0198011] and

 Halliburton Co  slumped 11.8 percent to $21.91 as
Goldman Sachs removed the oilfield services company from its

percent. The index has lost nearly 10 percent since April,
putting it on track for its biggest quarterly loss since March
2009.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.2 percent to
close at 1,002.80 points.
 The euro  was down 0.29 percent at $1.2269, after
having fallen to a four-year low against the dollar at $1.2112,
its lowest since April 2006 as signs the euro zone's debt
crisis is spreading to its banking system. The dollar rose to
its highest in 15 months against a basket of major currencies.
 A survey showed manufacturing activity in the euro zone
expanded in May at a considerably more sluggish pace than in
April, while separate data showed the pace of China's factory
output eased last month.
 China's PMI, an indicator of factory activity, compiled by
the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, fell to 53.9
in May from 55.7 in April, close to analysts forecasts of
54.0.
 However, it stood above the threshold of 50 that separates
expansion from contraction for the 15th consecutive month.
 ""The figures point to slower economic growth toward the end
of this year,"" said Eugen Weinberg, commodities analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The fear is that Chinese officials

 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, June 1 (Reuters) - Euro zone financial markets
weakened on Tuesday amid rising concern about banks' bad debts
and doubts about the pace of economic recovery.
 France reaffirmed a longstanding call for a formal economic
government of the 16-nation euro area, which has aroused German
suspicions in the past of an attempt to undermine the
independence of the European Central Bank. [ID:nPAB008371]
 The European Commission defended to trade unionists the need
for austerity measures to curb public debt and deficits swollen
by the financial crisis, as new data showed unemployment hit an
almost 12-year high of 10.1 percent in the euro zone in May.
[ID:nLDE65019A]
 The euro  briefly hit a four-year low against the
dollar and European shares <.FTEU3> were down as much as 2
percent when U.S. and British markets reopened after a long
weekend and investors reacted to ECB warnings of more big
write-downs to come for euro zone banks. [ID:nLDE6500FD]
 But they recovered after U.S. manfacturing data pointed to a
continued steady recovery in the world's biggest economy, in
contrast to the euro zone, where manufacturing activity grew at
a much more sluggish pace in May than April.
 Middle East tension over Israel's storming of a convoy of
Gaza-bound aid ships, and concern over slowing growth in China
contributed to a flight from risk.
 But jitters over Spain were also a factor after last
Friday's downgrade of Madrid's sovereign rating to AA+ from AAA
by Fitch Ratings. On Tuesday came news that number two savings
bank Caja Madrid has asked for up to 3 billion euros ($3.65
billion) from a government rescue fund as it continues merger
talks with five smaller banks. [ID:nLDE6500O7]
 Although the amount is within expectations, the request
disclosed by a source close to the company highlights the
headache the Spanish government faces in funding an overhaul of
the ""cajas"" in a climate of rising money market costs.

 ""ECONOMIC GOVERNMENT""
 In Paris, Economy Minister Christine Lagarde told
parliament: ""We must imperatively strengthen the economic
governmance of the European Union and even more the euro zone
with a true economic government.""
 Her comment came after Le Monde newspaper said President
Nicolas Sarkozy was pressing European partners to install the
group of euro zone leaders with a secretariat to act as an
economic government for the single currency bloc.
 European Union finance ministers will discuss next week how
to strengthen fiscal discipline to prevent a repetition of the
Greek debt crisis and improve economic coordination in the bloc.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel accepted the notion of
""economic governance"" for the first time earlier this year but
Berlin remains suspicious of French efforts to give governments
too much economic power at the expense of the market.
 Germany's top priority is to improve budget discipline --
backed by tougher sanctions on laggards -- including in France,
which is forecast to run a deficit of 8 percent of output this
year and a public debt of 88 percent of GDP.
 Worries about divergent budget trends as well as a widening
gap in competitiveness between Germany and its southern European
partners have increased tensions in credit markets.
 The cost of insuring Italian government dbet against default
reached a record 250 basis points on the credit default swaps
market, according to Markit data, while France's CDS edged up to
76 bps over the German benchmark.
 In Brussels, EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor told
the European Trade Union Confederation that governments needed
to balance austerity and economic growth to overcome the crisis.
 ""Europe's economy is under the stress of financial market
speculation, while national governments face excessive public
deficits and must engage in austerity programmes,"" Andor said.
 Trade unions face a tough choice between acquiescing to
austerity steps at the risk of angering members, or fighting
them with strikes that could undermine economic recovery and
cause a market backlash. [ID:nLDE65019E]

 * Says European austerity measures to hurt growth
 * Says Europe to face high volatility for foreseeable future
 
 By Mia Shanley
 STOCKHOLM, June 1 (Reuters) - Global economic growth will be
""markedly lower"" by the end of the year as European governments
push through painful austerity measures, strangling the region's
recovery, Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said.
 Stiglitz, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Economics, said
on Tuesday it was not yet clear whether the world was headed for
a double-dip recession, but that one thing was certain: Europe
is going to face a roller coaster ride for the ""foreseeable
future"".
 ""I think the only thing one can be confident about at this
juncture is that there is likely to be volatility,"" he told
Reuters in an interview in Stockholm.
 ""And volatility is bad for growth. This is not a zero sum
game, this is a negative sum game.""
 World stocks fell on Tuesday and the euro skidded to a
four-year low against the dollar on expectations that slowing
growth in the euro zone and China would hamper the global
economic recovery.
 ""The problem is that we're in, you might say, a vicious
cycle,"" Stiglitz said on the sidelines of a development
conference. ""Austerity is going to lower growth. A weak euro and
a weak Europe is going to be bad for the United States.""
 European Union member states including Greece, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland and Italy have announced austerity measures to
placate nervous financial markets worried by Europe's debt
problems. [ID:nLDE64Q1OF]
 Spain's parliament passed by just one vote last week
government plans to shave 15 billion euros ($18.2 billion) off
the fiscal deficit with measures including salary cuts for
public workers and pension freezes.
 
 UNDER PRESSURE
 Europe's single currency has come under pressure on concerns
that sovereign debt problems and slowing growth will usher in a
new round of writedowns for the banking sector.
 Exactly how painful the impact on growth will be is
uncertain, Stiglitz said.
 ""It would depend to some extent on how successful the
countries are in bringing austerity, how fast they bring those
policies in. Because we have had such bad accounting of the
banks, we don't know how bad a shape they are in.""
 The fact that not just fiscally weak southern European
countries, but also nations such as France and Germany at the
euro zone's core are under pressure to cut debt and deficits
amassed during the financial crisis, is adding to concerns.
 Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University in New York and
formerly a chief economist at the World Bank, said Europe needed
to restructure expenditures and taxes in ways that would bring
down government deficits while also enhancing growth.
He would not say whether the euro was currently undervalued
or whether it could fall further against the dollar but said
exchange rates and markets would remain extremely volatile until
steady global growth resumed.
 Apart from a potential spillover of Europe's fiscal debt
woes to the United States, Stiglitz said the world's biggest
economy had a host of its own problems to deal with: the banks,
poor accounting standards, bad credit supply and higher mortgage
defaults.
 ""Many Americans were hoping we would have an export-led
recovery. That looks increasingly unlikely,"" he said.
 ""A weak America will make it difficult for Europe. And we
are unfortunately in a mutual framework that is likely to impede
rather than accelerate a recovery.""

489,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2010 11:35AM ET</span>",Global manufacturing growth slows but still strong," LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - Global manufacturing expanded at
a slower pace last month than in April but still grew at its
second-fastest rate during the past six years, a survey showed
on Tuesday.
The Global Manufacturing PMI, produced by JPMorgan with
research and supply management organisations, fell to 57.2 in
May from 57.8 in April, marking the 11th month above the 50 mark
that divides contraction from growth.
 ""The latest PMI data suggest that the global manufacturing
sector maintained both its solid growth momentum and broad base
in May,"" said David Hensley at JPMorgan.
 ""However, rates of expansion in output and new orders eased
from their April highs, suggesting that this initial recovery
phase may have already passed its peak.""
The global output index fell to 59.5 from 60.9 in April
while the new orders index dropped to 59.2 from April's six-year
high of 60.3.
 However, global manufacturing employment increased for the
fifth successive month in May, with jobs added at the fastest
pace in six years. JPMorgan said the sharpest growth in staffing
levels was recorded in the United States.
 Earlier data showed China's PMI fell last month, as did
those in the euro zone, the U.S. and some other Asian nations.
However, the UK managed to buck the trend with its index holding
at April's 15-year high.
 The index combines survey data from countries including the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and
Russia.

value 
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 1 (Reuters) - The drop in commodities prices
following the financial crisis has made it much harder for the
world's poorest countries to buy manufactured goods, according
to a study issued on Tuesday.
 The report by the International Trade Centre (ITC) shows
that least developed countries (LDCs) suffered a disastrous
decline in 2009 in their terms of trade -- which compare a
country's export and import prices, and hence indicate how much
it needs to sell in order to buy goods.
 A limited fall in import costs last year failed to
compensate for much sharper falls in export earnings, said
Willem van der Geest, lead economist of the ITC, a joint agency
of the United Nations and World Trade Organization.
 The terms of trade deterioration means that poor countries
are worse off, even though global trade volumes are reviving.
 LDC terms of trade had improved between 2004 and 2008 as
commodity prices rose, allowing them to fund more imports, but
have now dropped back to 2004-2005 levels, he said.
 ""2009 has essentially eroded all the favourable terms of
trade movements ... All that gain has been wiped out on account
of the financial crisis,"" he said in an interview.
 The economic slowdown following the financial crisis
depressed demand, and with it prices of LDC exports.
 The report shows that LDCs suffered deteriorating terms of
trade not only with rich partners such as the United States or
the European Union, but also with emerging economies such as
Brazil or China (data for India and Russia are not available).
 ""Terms of trade declined even more than those with the EU
and U.S.,"" van der Geest said. ""South-South trade enthusiasts
should take note of that.""
 Trading the same basket of goods, LDCs would have had to
export more than twice as much in the first quarter of 2009 to
finance the same level of imports from China as in the third
quarter of 2008, the report shows.
 LDCs can draw some relief this year from the fall in the
euro, the unit of account used for imports from the EU, from
which they source much of their machinery, van der Geest noted.
 The study builds on an earlier report from January that
looked at the impact of lower commodity prices on export
earnings compared with export volumes for LDCs.
 Although there was some improvement in the last quarter of
2009, LDCs now have to ship more to earn less. Exports,
excluding oil, grew 5.8 percent in volume terms last year while
export earnings fell 8.5 percent.
 The figures vary widely by commodity. Exports of copper,
sold by poor countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo,
rose 63 percent in volume terms last year but produced an
increase in earnings of only 14.6 percent.
 But volumes and earnings for textiles ticked down only
slightly, leaving Bangladesh little affected.

* Further hikes depend on domestic, global developments
(Adds details)
 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, June 1 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada raised its
key interest rate on Tuesday from emergency low levels, but
said the European debt crisis made its next move highly
unpredictable.
 The rate hike, to 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent, made
Canada the first of the G7 major industrialized countries to
begin hiking interest rates after the global financial crisis.
 ""Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the
outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have
to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic
developments,"" the central bank said in a statement.
 The bank said economic activity was broadly in line with
its expectations after two quarters of robust domestic growth,
and inflation was also matching expectations.
 It said the debt crisis in Greece and some other European
countries has so far had only a limited impact on Canada
through lower commodity prices and tighter financing
conditions. But some countries will now have to cut spending
quickly and that, combined with debt reduction by banks and
households, could slow global growth.
 The bank said its 0.5 percent interest rate was still
highly stimulative and would help it achieve its 2 percent
inflation target amid considerable slack in the economy, strong
domestic spending and an uneven global recovery.
 Markets had expected the rate hike. In a Reuters poll of 40
analysts, 32 forecast a quarter-point rate hike and that view
was unanimous among Canada's 12 primary securities dealers.
 The Canadian dollar  eased after the news, sliding
to around C$1.0556 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.70 U.S. cents,
from C$1.0498, or 95.26 earlier in the day.
 Canada's economy fell into mild recession last year, but
its banks emerged unscathed from the credit crisis and jobless
rates did not soar as high as in the United States.
 Consumer spending and hot housing market have fueled a
faster-than-expected recovery since then. The economy grew at a
surprising 6.1 percent annual clip in the first quarter, and by
4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 But the bank suggested the Canadian recovery could be at
risk from developments beyond its borders.
""Recent tensions in Europe are likely to result in higher
borrowing costs and more rapid tightening of fiscal policy in
some countries - an important downside risk identified in the
April Monetary Policy Report,"" it said.

 BEIJING, June 1 (Reuters) - China wants the yuan to play an
active role in denominating international trade and investment
flows in its northwestern Xinjiang region, the central bank said
in a statement on Tuesday.
 The Chinese government has recently unveiled a series of
policies to promote the development of Xinjiang, of which the
central bank's announcement is the latest.
 It also points to an expansion of trade-settlement trials
using the yuan, intended to promote the Chinese currency's
gradual internationalisation. According to bankers and local
media, China will soon significantly expand the programme, which
until now has been confined to a couple of select regions.
 Until now, foreign trade throughout China has predominantly
been denominated in dollars and the yuan has limited
convertibility.
 ""An important central bank measure in supporting Xinjiang is
to make full play of the yuan's positive role in cross-border
trade and investment activities,"" Zhou Xiaochuan, the People's
Bank of China governor, said in the statement.
 Xinjiang, whose vast territory borders Russia, Mongolia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and
India, has abundant oil reserves and is China's largest natural
gas-producing region.
 It is the key base for China's trade with central Asia.
According to Chinese official statistics, Xinjiang's exports
fell 43.9 percent to $10.8 billion in 2009 and the region's
imports rose 3.0 percent to $3.0 billion last year.
 The local Uighurs are a Turkic people who are largely Muslim
and share linguistic and cultural bonds with Central Asia.
 Xinjiang has long been a tightly-controlled hotbed of ethnic
tension, fostered by an economic gap between many Uighurs and
Han, government controls on religion and culture and an influx
of Han migrants who now are the majority in most big cities.
 In April, China replaced the top official in Xinjiang, hit
last year by deadly rioting and a scare over syringe stabbings.
 Xinjiang's economy grew by 8.0 percent in 2009, compared to
national GDP growth of 8.7 percent.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) -The euro fell to a 4-year low
against the dollar on Tuesday as signs the euro zone's debt
crisis is spreading to its banking system hit the single
currency, while deteriorating sentiment supported the greenback.
 Rising Middle East tensions following Israel's storming of
aid ships bound for Gaza fuelled safe-haven demand for the
dollar, with tepid Chinese data also hurting risk appetite.
 ""Disappointing Chinese data and Middle East tensions are
favouring the dollar today,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman,
currency analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 The European Central Bank warned on Monday that euro zone
banks faced up to 195 billion euros in a ""second wave"" of
potential loan losses over the next 18 months due to the
financial crisis, and said it had increased purchases of euro
zone government bonds. [ID:nLAG006303]
 ""We're seeing follow-though selling after the ECB warning,""
said ING FX strategist Tom Levinson, noting the closure of the
UK and U.S. markets on Monday had delayed the impact of the
warning.
 At 1135 GMT, the euro was trading around 1.2 percent lower
versus the dollar  at $1.2165 after dropping to a
four-year low of $1.2112.
 Traders said stop-losses were targeted under the previous
low at $1.2143, while technical analysts highlighted a break
below key support at $1.2135, the 50 percent retracement of the
2000-2008 rally.
 A daily close below $1.2135 was key for further downside
potential, while options traders noted significant barrier
interest at $1.2000.
 The closed Monday with its sixth consecutive monthly
decline, the longest losing sequence the single currency has
experienced since 1999, just after its inception.
 Growth concerns were heightened as euro zone manufacturing
activity expanded in May at a considerably more sluggish pace
than April's 46-month high, a survey showed. [ID:nSLAVGE65K]
 Versus the yen, the euro traded with losses of around 1.5
percent at 110.50 yen. It also slipped to an 18-month low versus
sterling  of 83.35 pence. 
 ""The euro is still reacting to negative issues,"" said Ian
Stannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas, with Spain's
ratings downgrade last week also weighing.
 Fitch cut Spain's credit ratings to AA+ from AAA on Friday,
saying its economic recovery would be more muted than the
government forecast. [ID:nLDE64R1ZE]
 RISK AVERSION

 The RBA held rates at 4.5 percent but traders watching for
hints it might hold rates steady for the coming months only got
a statement saying that policy was appropriate for the near
term. [ID:nSGE650052]
 The Australian dollar  slipped around 1.6 percent to
trade at $0.8320.
 China's official purchasing managers' index fell to 53.9 in
May from 55.7 in April. Australia's heavy reliance on trade with
China makes it sensitive to Chinese indicators.
 The dollar was up around 0.7 percent versus a currency
basket <.DXY> at 87.212, after moving to its highest level since

 By Anooja Debnath and Matthias Williams
 BANGALORE/NEW DELHI, June 1 (Reuters) - India's
manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest rate in over two
years in May, bolstered by steady growth in output and new
orders, reinforcing expectations of a further hike in interest
rates late next month.
 Automakers also posted sharp sales growth for May, although
stocks dropped more than 2 percent on fears that Europe's debt
problems would hurt fund inflows from foreign investors and
potentially derail the global economic recovery.
 Many economists and traders expect worries about the euro
zone debt crisis will keep the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from
raising its policy rates before its next quarterly review on
July 27, as some market watchers had earlier predicted.
 But the central bank is still expected to raise rates by 25
basis points at the July meeting as it struggles to contain
mounting price pressures. It has already increased rates by 50
basis points since mid-March. [ID:nSGE64C0FS]
 ""Inflation is not at peak level. It is still higher than we
would like it,"" RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said on Tuesday.
 Monsoon rains arrived in southern India on time on Monday,
and policymakers will keep watch on how the rainy season pans
out after last summer's drought sent food prices sharply
higher.
 In a sign economic growth is accelerating, the HSBC Markit
Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), based on a survey of 500
firms, surged to a 27-month-high of 59.0 in May from 57.2 in
April.
 It was the 14th consecutive month that the indicator has
been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction.
The rate of growth had slowed in March and April.
 ""The tightening mode of policy will continue but the timing
and quantum of hikes will also be dependent on the evolving
global situation. Today's data does aid a tightening bias...,""
said Namrata Padhye, an economist with IDBI Gilts in Mumbai.
 Another report showed Indian exports rose an annual 36
percent in April, their sixth straight rise, although the
figure was flattered by weak shipments last year and could take
a knock if the euro zone debt crisis worsens and saps demand.
 ""The Indian economy is hardly pausing for breath,"" said
Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC.
 ""Output growth remains at a robust pace and new orders
continue to pour in. This is benefiting the job market as more
and more firms are hiring,"" he added.
 The new orders index climbed to 63.7 in May from 61.9 in
April, mainly driven by domestic demand, the PMI report showed.
It was the 14th consecutive month when new orders expanded.
 The employment index rose to its highest since August 2005,
signalling modest job creation across the economy.
 On Monday, data showed India's economy grew 8.6 percent in
the March quarter, the strongest in six months.
 Investors, however, largely ignored the bullish domestic
reports, with Indian shares <.BSESN> falling 2.2 percent on
doubts over the health of the global recovery. The yield on the
10-year benchmark bond  eased one basis point to
7.55 percent.
 ROBUST AUTO SALES
 Maruti Suzuki , the country's largest car maker,
reported record monthly sales, which rose 28 percent annually
in May [ID:nBMA007676], and utility vehicles leader Mahindra &
Mahindra  posted a 69 percent jump.
 While such figures point to a sharp improvement in business
conditions and consumer confidence, prices remain a worry as
Asia's third-largest economy battles stubbornly high inflation.
 Wholesale prices , the Reserve Bank of India's
most closely watched gauge of inflation, eased slightly in
April to 9.6 percent, but are not far from 10.1 percent seen in
February, which was the highest since October 2008.
 ""Price pressures are of concern. However, the recent
readings point to a stabilisation, with both the input and the
output price indices easing a little in May,"" Neumann said.
 On Tuesday, other PMI data from export-dependent countries
like China showed a slowdown in growth amid uncertainty over
the fallout from Europe's debt crisis. [ID:nTOE65001Z].
 An Indian government official said the country's April
trade numbers did not reflect the possible impact of Greece's
debt crisis on trade. [ID:nSGE64J03A]
 April imports  rose 43 percent from a year
earlier to $27.3 billion, data showed. Non-oil imports grew 34
percent in April to $19.2 billion, reflecting healthy
industrial activity.
 Indian exports have shown strong growth in the past half
year. Exports had dropped 4.7 percent in the fiscal year
2009/10 as the global slowdown dampened demand. The trade
deficit  stood at $10.4 billion in April.

 By Joerg Voelkerling
 NUREMBERG, Germany, June 1 (Reuters) - German unemployment
fell for the eleventh month running in May, data showed on
Tuesday, as Europe's largest economy pursued a path towards
durable growth by adding jobs in struggling a euro zone market.
 Joblessness declined by a seasonally adjusted 45,000
month-on-month, far more than expected as labour reforms paid
dividends and a weaker euro boosted exports, though analysts
warned the spreading debt crisis in the single currency zone
might weigh on the German recovery in the coming months.
 The decline pushed the adjusted jobless rate down to 7.7
percent in May from 7.8 percent in the prior month, Federal
Labour Office data showed.
 Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the total would
decrease by 20,000 .
 ""The labour market is looking extraordinarily robust,"" said
Stefan Schilbe, an economist at HSBC Trinkaus. ""It's profiting
not just from the seasonal pick-up, but also the fact that
exports are doing well.
 ""There are also signs that companies are not laying people
off from shortened hours, but that they're taking people on full
time again. That's positive and should result in improved
consumer spending,"" he added.
 Earlier on Tuesday, data showed that retail sales rose
modestly in April as consumers upped their spending.
 The headline unadjusted unemployment total fell by 165,000
on the month to 3.242 million, the Office said.

 ""The bogeyman of mass unemployment has been shooed away.
Successful labour market reforms, the government's famous crisis
tool of short-work schemes and companies' prudence have made the
labour market the bright spot of the recession,"" said Carsten
Brzeski, economist at ING Financial Markets.
 The government's subsidy scheme for short-term working,
known as ""Kurzarbeit"", has helped Germany weather its worst
postwar economic recession with only a modest rise in
unemployment.
 ""It should only be a matter of a few months before the
unemployment rate returns to its pre-crisis level,"" said
Brzeski.
 If adjusted unemployment declines at the same rate as in May
for another two months, the jobless total will fall to its
lowest level since the start of 1993, Bundesbank data show.
 
 RISKS TO CONSUMER RECOVERY
 Germany exited its recession in the second quarter of last
year and recent economic indicators have beaten forecasts.
 Industrial output and orders surged in March, while exports
rose at their fastest rate in nearly 18 years, surpassing even
the most optimistic predictions.
 ""May's fall in German unemployment confirms that the euro
zone's largest economy is faring relatively well despite the
periphery's troubles,"" said Jennifer McKeown, an analyst at
Capital Economics.
 However, forward-looking surveys suggest the euro zone debt
crisis may burden the recovery. The GfK market research group
said last week consumer sentiment was likely to fall in June as
uncertainty over the euro zone crisis weighed heavily on
households' view of the economy and income expectations.
 In addition, unemployment could rise as subsidies expire,
and wage growth looks set to fall further, said McKeown. Fiscal
tightening will also weigh on households' incomes.
 ""In all, then, while the export recovery is having a
positive impact on the labour market, there is still little hope
of the consumer revival that would be needed to ensure a
sustained recovery in Germany and support growth in the euro
zone as a whole,"" she said.

 SEOUL, June 1 (Reuters) - The proposed introduction of a bank
levy and possible ways to control cross-border capital flows will
top the agenda at this week's G20 finance ministers meetings,
host South Korea said on Tuesday.
 Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun also told an unscheduled
media briefing that the euro zone's debt crisis was becoming a

leading economies meet in Busan, South Korea, on Friday and
Saturday to fine-tune their views on key global issues before
their leaders hold a summit later in the month in Canada.
 There is broad support for the proposal but some countries,
which experienced no heavy cost of bailing out financial
institutions, are opposed to it.
 Yoon said drawing up some form of regulations to cushion the
capital flows across countries would also likely be discussed at
the meetings.
 ""The IMF's position has also changed (toward introducing
controls),"" he said.
 Regarding the domestic economy, Yoon said the government's
position was to maintain its existing economic policy because
private sector recovery was not yet fully self-sustaining.
 But he played down the slowing pace of annual growth in the
statistics agency's composite leading indicator in recent months,
which many analysts took as underlining the moderating recovery
of Asia's fourth-largest economy. [ID:nSEL003108]

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - Manufacturing in the euro zone
expanded in May, but at a far slower rate than April's 46-month
high as cost pressures and tighter margins drove firms to take
their feet off the production accelerator, a survey showed on
Tuesday.
 The 16-nation bloc and its common currency have been hit by
waves of investor insecurity churned up by the region's debt
crisis and fears that troubles in Greece may be spreading to
other peripheral euro zone economies.
 ""There has been a slowdown in growth globally and in the
euro zone there is subdued domestic demand due to the austerity
measure implemented in some countries,"" said Luigi Speranza at
BNP Paribas.

 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
for May sank to 55.8 from 57.6 in April, nudged down from an
earlier flash estimate of 55.9.
 This is its eighth month above the 50.0 mark that divides
growth from contraction, but markets were unmoved by the data.
 Cost pressures were on the rise, with the price of
factories' raw materials forced up by the weaker euro.
 The output index recorded its second fastest slide in the
survey's history -- only surpassed in the aftermath of
Lehman Brothers' collapse -- to stand well shy of April's near
10-year high of 61.2 at 56.8. It inched up from a flash reading
of 56.7.
 ""Importantly, however, the pace of growth remained robust,
and the slowdown in May no doubt reflects a payback from April's
ultra-strong growth to some extent,"" said Chris Williamson at
data provider Markit.
 In Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, manufacturing
activity slowed from the previous month's survey's record high.
Neighbouring France, the second biggest, saw growth in its
sector slow from April's near 4-year high.
 Spain and Italy also saw a dip in their main indexes. A
separate survey on the UK showed manufacturing activity holding
on to its strongest pace in 15 years.
 Euro zone manufacturers were hit by rising input prices,
with that index reaching its highest level since July 2008 at
73.7 last month, compared to 73.4 in April.
 The euro has been battered in recent weeks, driving up costs
of materials from outside the bloc, on fears that Greece's debt
problems will spread and in spite of a $1 trillion safety net
set up by European policymakers earlier this month.
 However, the output price index fell from last month,
suggesting producers had more trouble passing on price rises to
customers.
 Flash data released on Monday showed prices in the bloc rose
1.6 percent in May, faster than the 1.5 percent seen in April.

 * Riksbank slashes forecast for 2010 loan losses

 * Says risks remain, uncertainty has increased
 * Says high level of household debt no immediate threat
 
 By Mia Shanley and Simon Johnson
 STOCKHOLM, June 1 (Reuters) - Sweden's central bank slashed
its forecast on Tuesday for loan losses for its four major
financial groups and said the country's lenders were in a strong
position to weather uncertain market conditions.
 Sweden's top four lenders have focused on reducing risk and
boosting capital levels during the financial crisis which led to
big losses for the banks, many of which had built up big
exposures to the crisis-hit Baltic region.
 The central bank said it expected loan losses at the four
major banks -- Nordea , SEB , Handelsbanken
 and Swedbank  -- would reach 61 billion
crowns ($7.85 billion) over the next three years.
 It cut its forecast for loan losses this year to 28 billion
crowns, from a previously seen 65 billion.
 The Riksbank said in a twice-yearly stability report that
while risks remained, mainly due to the effect of Greece's debt
woes on markets and the possibility that a recovery in the
Baltic region would stall, banks' finances were robust.
 ""The Riksbank therefore makes the assessment that the banks
are well-equipped to meet unexpected and negative events in the
period ahead,"" the Riksbank said in a statement.
 ""But there are still large risks, and uncertainty has
recently increased,"" the central bank said.
 In the event of a much more negative outcome than its main
scenario, the Riksbank said Sweden's banks would still have
enough capital to manage potentially higher loan losses but that
they could face trouble obtaining funding.
 
 IN GOOD SHAPE
 While markets remain on edge over a recovery in Europe due
to concerns over countries' debt problems, most indicators show
Sweden is in good shape after its worst recession since World
War Two.
 Sweden's economy grew a much better-than-expected 1.4
percent in the first quarter from the previous three months
while data on Tuesday showed the purchasing managers' index
climbing to 66.0 points for the manufacturing sector in May,
from 64.0 points in the previous month. [ID:nSAT008577]
 Its financial system has little direct exposure to the debt
problems in southern Europe, but with much of Sweden's exports
bound for the euro zone, any slowdown there would drag on the
Nordic economy's recovery.
 Nordea analyst Torbjorn Isaksson said domestic economic
developments gave weight to arguments for a rise in interest
rates.
 ""But the uncertainty surrounding the debt crisis in the
eurozone and worries that could arise in the financial markets
could restrain interest rate hikes going forward,"" he added.
 The Riksbank also highlighted potential problems in Sweden's
housing market due to fast-rising property prices.
 It said the high level of household debt did not entail an
immediate threat to the banks or financial stability, but warned
that a fall in house prices -- as seen in many other countries
-- could create unease on the bond market and hurt funding.
 It added that net interest income at the Swedish lenders
will continue to decline in 2010 due to ultra-loose monetary
policy, weak demand for corporate loans and higher funding costs
due to new bank regulations.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) -The euro fell on Tuesday as fears
the euro zone's debt crisis could spread to its banking system
hit the single currency, while deteriorating sentiment supported
the greenback.
 Rising tensions in the Middle-East following Israel's
storming of aid ships bound for Gaza fuelled safe-haven demand
for the dollar, with disappointing Chinese data also hurting
risk appetite.
 The European Central Bank warned on Monday that euro zone
banks faced up to 195 billion euros in a ""second wave"" of
potential loan losses over the next 18 months due to the
financial crisis, and said it had increased purchases of
euro-zone government bonds.
 ""Focus is back on to euro zone problems this morning and it
is the bad loans story that is weighing on the euro in early
trading,"" said Audrey Childe-Freeman, currency analyst at Brown
Brothers Harriman.
 At 0730 GMT, the euro was trading with losses versus the
dollar of around 1 percent at $1.2185.
 It was hovering above a four-year low of $1.2143 struck on
May 19. Near-term support is seen around $1.2135, the 50 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the currency's 2000-08 advance.
 The euro's close on Monday marked its sixth consecutive
monthly decline, the longest losing sequence the single currency
has experienced since 1999, just after its inception.
 Versus the yen, the euro traded with losses of over 1
percent at 110.60 yen. It also slipped to a 1-year low versus
sterling of 84.15 pence. 
 ""The euro is still reacting to negative issues,"" said Ian
Stannard, currency strategist at BNP Paribas, adding that
Spain's downgrade by Fitch last week was also weighing on the
currency.
 Fitch Ratings cut Spain's credit ratings to AA+ from AAA on
Friday, saying its economic recovery would be more muted than
the government forecast.
 
 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR
 The Australian dollar was knocked after approvals for
building new Australian homes dived in April, backing bets the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would not raise interest rates
again soon.
 The RBA kept rates on hold at 4.5 percent but traders who
were watching for hints that it might hold rates steady for the
coming months, only got a central bank statement saying that its
policy was appropriate for the near term.
 ""Economic fundamentals in Australia are not so negative but
the impact from Europe, worries that the pace of China's
economic growth may slow, and weakness in stocks are all
weighing on the Aussie,"" said Tomohiro Nishida, treasury
department manager at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.
 The Australian dollar slipped around 1.5 percent to trade at
$0.8330.
 China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to
53.9 in May from 55.7 in April. Australia's heavy reliance on
trade with China makes it sensitive to Chinese indicators.
 The dollar traded with gains of around 0.5 percent versus a
currency basket at 87.044 as European equity markets followed
Asian stocks into negative territory and risk appetite
deteriorated.
 ""Disappointing Chinese data and Middle-East tensions are
favouring the dollar today,"" said Brown Brothers'
Childe-Freeman.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Tuesday and
the euro hit a four-year low against the dollar as expectations
that slowing growth in China and the euro zone would hamper the
global economic recovery hit riskier assets.
 European stocks dropped nearly 2 percent with BP 
losing more than 15 percent after its attempt to plug the worst
oil spill in U.S. history in the Gulf of Mexico failed.
 After May saw the most volatile month of trading since the
aftermath of Lehman Brothers' collapse in late 2008, investors
focused on concerns that growth would slow in a euro zone
struggling to rein in debt, in turn reducing demand for exports
from economies like China, reducing production there.
 A survey showed manufacturing activity in the euro zone
expanded in May at a considerably more sluggish pace than in
April [nSLAVGE65K], while separate data showed the pace of
China's factory output eased last month [nTOE65001Z].
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street,
down around 1.4 percent . U.S. shares fell one percent on
Friday before a long weekend.
 ""With the weakness on Wall Street we saw on Friday, and the
uncertainty over the euro zone, the fragility of the market
certainly hasn't gone away ... we are back to risk aversion,""
said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown.
MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell more than 1
percent on the day. The index has lost nearly 10 percent since
April, putting it on track for its biggest quarterly loss since
March 2009.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> fell 1.8 percent while
emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> lost 2.1 percent.
 The cost of protecting Italian government debt against
default hit a record high of 250 basis points as concerns about
euro zone sovereign ratings grew after a downgrade of Spain's
credit rating last week.
 The five-year BP credit default swap shot up by 71 basis
points to 173 bps, according to CDS monitor Markit.
 
 EURO DOWN AGAIN
 The euro fell 1.4 percent to $1.2112 , its lowest
since April 2006. The dollar <.DXY> rose to its highest in 15
months against a basket of major currencies.
 The single currency has been under pressure as concerns grew
that the region's sovereign debt problems and slowing growth
will usher in a new round of writedowns for the banking sector.
 The European Central Bank warned on Monday that euro zone
banks faced up to 195 billion euros ($239 billion) in a ""second
wave"" of potential loan losses over the next 18 months due to
the financial crisis, and said it had increased purchases of
euro zone government bonds. [ID:nLDE64U0OS]
 ""The situation remains difficult for the euro,"" Commerzbank
said in a note to clients.
 ""Concerns about the consequences of the savings measures
that have been initiated in many countries demonstrate how bad
sentiment for the joint currency currently is.""
 Global growth concerns weighed on oil, with U.S. crude oil
 losing 3 percent at one point to below $72 a barrel.
Falling risky assets boosted demand for government bonds,
pushing Bund futures  up 47 ticks.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the
euro zone expanded in May at a considerably more sluggish pace
than April's 46-month high as firms let off the production
accelerator, a survey showed on Tuesday.
 Cost pressures were also on the rise, with the price of
factories' raw materials forced up by the weaker euro.
 The 16-nation bloc and its common currency have been hit by
waves of insecurity churned up by the region's debt crisis and
fears that troubles in Greece may spread to other peripheral
economies.
 ""The May PMIs highlight the speed with which uncertainty
surrounding the sovereign debt crisis appears to have hit
business activity,"" said Chris Williamson at data provider
Markit.
 The Markit Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index
for May sank to 55.8 from 57.6 in April, nudged down from an
earlier flash estimate of 55.9, but its eighth month above the
50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction.
 The output index recorded its second fastest slide in the
survey's history -- only surpassed in the aftermath of the
Lehman's collapse -- well shy of April's near 10-year high of
61.2 at 56.8 but inching up from a flash reading of 56.7.
 ""Importantly, however, the pace of growth remained robust,
and the slowdown in May no doubt reflects a pay-back from
April's ultra-strong growth to some extent,"" Williamson said.
 In Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, manufacturing
activity slowed from the previous month's survey record high.
Neighbouring France, the second biggest, saw growth in its
sector slow from April's near 4-year high.
 Spain and Italy also saw a dip in their main indexes from
April.
 Manufacturers were hit by rising input prices with the index
reaching its highest level since July 2008 at 73.7 last month,
compared to 73.4 in April.

 TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro and the Australian dollar
fell on Tuesday as investors remained keen to cut risk, but the
Aussie trimmed losses after comments from the Australian central
bank were neutral on monetary policy rather than dovish as some
had expected.
 The euro fell back towards a four-year trough against the
dollar marked last month, under pressure as worries mount that
the region's sovereign debt problems may spread to the banking
system.
 The European Central Bank on Monday warned that euro zone
banks faced up to 195 billion euros in a ""second wave"" of
potential loan losses over the next 18 months due to the
financial crisis, and said it had increased purchases of
euro-zone government bonds.
 The Australian dollar was knocked lower after approvals for
building new Australian homes dived in April, backing bets the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would not raise interest rates
anytime soon..
 The RBA kept rates on hold at 4.5 percent as expected but
traders who were watching for hints that it might hold rates
steady for the coming months, only got a central bank statement
saying that its policy was appropriate for the near term.
 That helped the Aussie pare losses. The Australian dollar was
0.7 percent lower at $0.8398 after falling as far as $0.8354.
Against the yen, it dropped 1 percent to 76.47 yen after sliding
at one point to 76.05 yen.
 ""Economic fundamentals in Australia are not so negative but
the impact from Europe, worries that the pace of China's economic
growth may slow, and weakness in stocks are all weighing on the
Aussie,"" said Tomohiro Nishida, treasury department manager at
Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.
 The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2273, hovering above a
four-year low of $1.2143 struck on May 19. Near-term support is
seen around $1.2140, the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
currency's 2000-08 advance.
 ""Over the next 18 months calm water could turn turbulent in
the blink of an eye,"" RBC Capital senior currency analyst David
Watt wrote in a note.
 ""Accordingly, euro rallies seem likely to remain rather
shallow and in that regard it is struggling to maintain the $1.23
handle.""
 Traders said investors were looking at every bounce in the
single currency to sell. Against the yen, the euro slipped 0.1
percent to 111.93 yen.
 Speculators and funds have gone short on the euro in droves
in recent months with the latest data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission suggesting they were still wary of cutting
those positions.
 Eyes are on the G20 meeting of finance officials and central
bankers in South Korea later this week, with investors keen for
reassurance that the euro zone debt problems are being dealt
with.
 The dollar inched down 0.1 percent against the yen to
91.16 yen.
 But the dollar index edged up 0.1 percent to 86.67, supported
by safe-haven inflows amid growing worries about the
sustainability of a global recovery.
 Underlining those economic risks, China warned on Monday that
global growth remained vulnerable to sovereign debt risks and the
possibility of a second downturn.
 Data showed on Tuesday China's official purchasing managers'
index (PMI) fell to 53.9 in May from 55.7 in April. The reading
was in line with the median forecast and marked the 15th straight
month that the PMI has stood above the threshold of 50 that
demarcates expansion from contraction.
 In Japan, Tokyo market players were split on how much impact
political woes for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama would have on
the yen and other assets.
 Hatoyama said on Tuesday that he would stay on in his post,
media reported, despite pressure from within his own party to
resign as his approval ratings slide ahead of an upper house
election.
 ""A change in leadership won't end Japan's political
confusion. The yen is likely to weaken just as political
confusion in Britain has recently hit sterling,"" said Koji
Fukaya, senior FX strategist at Deutsche Securities.
 Cross/yen was also hurt after news that Argentina extended
the deadline for its debt swap by two weeks on Monday.

 SEOUL, June 1 (Reuters) - South Korea's exports grew faster
than expected in May, but are expected to moderate in months
ahead as Europe's efforts to rein its debt are seen hurting
global trade and economic recovery.
 Asia's fourth-largest economy has been recovering from the
global downturn faster than initially thought, but uncertainty
about future demand for its goods is cementing market view that
the central bank will not hurry to raise interest rates.
 ""Today's data show no signs yet of any significant impact
of the euro-area debt crisis on European demand for Korean
exports,"" said Brian Jackson, senior emerging market strategist
at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 ""But the key word here is 'yet' and there still must be
some caution about the near-term strength of external demand,
not only for Korea but for the rest of Asia.""
 Exports in May rose 41.9 percent from a year earlier,
beating a forecast of a 38.2 percent growth in a Reuters poll.
 May's average exports value per working day rose to a
record high of $1.84 billion in May from a revised $1.64
billion in April, government data showed.
 ""Exports will inevitably slow down with the euro zone's
problems, which will result in weaker growth in the second
half. That may make it more difficult for the Bank of Korea to
increase rates,"" said Hwang Tae-yeon, a Tong Yang Securities'
fixed-income analyst.
 South Korea is the first major exporting economy in the
region to report foreign trade data each month, providing an
indication of strength of global demand for goods.
 Other data also backed market view that interest rates
remained on hold.
 A manufacturing survey showed the sector expanding at its
slowest pace in five months in May, while annual inflation came
in at subdued 2.7 percent, below market forecasts.
 Reflecting caution about the economy's outlook, Seoul
shares fell 0.8 percent by 0500 GMT, the won was down 0.4
percent and June treasury bond futures were up 0.06 point.
 EXTERNAL FACTORS SEEN WEIGHING
 Lingering worries about the euro zone, along with further
possible tightening moves by China, are expected to hurt South
Korea's trade balance in the second half, a senior government
official said, although annual growth in shipments to the
European Union during the first 20 days of May more than
doubled from April.
 ""European economies are expected to slow down on the euro
zone fiscal crisis and exports to China will be affected by
Beijing's exit strategy,"" said Kim Kyung-sik, deputy minister
for trade and investment policy at the Ministry of Knowledge
Economy.
 The trade surplus is expected to shrink in the second half
compared with a surplus of up to $15 billion expected in the
first six months of the year, Kim said.
 In a sign of that the euro zone debt crisis has begun
affecting the currency bloc's economy, its economic sentiment
gauge plunged in May, data showed on Monday.

 COMMENTARY:
 DAVID COHEN, ECONOMIST, ACTION ECONOMICS, SINGAPORE
 ""A lot will depend on the trajectory for inflation. It
should continue creeping up, year-on-year going forward. In
part the base effect should boost it a little going forward.
 ""We had been saying September for a rate rise to 6.75
percent but we keep hearing continued statements from the
government that there's no hurry. So we will see what happens.
 ""Economic growth seems to be continuing and there's this
nervousness around the world about the fallout from the
eurozone problems. But the BI will be playing it by ear.
 ""There's a sense the global economic recovery is
continuing.
 ""For the rupiah, a lot will hinge on the global
environment. It has firmed in the last few days. It came under
pressure like most regional currencies when there was a flight
to safety when markets were displaying diminished risk appetite
but that seems to have calmed down a bit over the past two
days.
 ""Assuming the global economic recovery continues and the
financial problems in the eurozone don't spiral into another
major financial crisis, then the rupiah should be able to
strengthen further and perhaps get back to its highs of a
couple of years ago. It should be able to test the 9000 level
again, that's hardly very far away.""
 ANDRY ASMORO, ECONOMIST, BAHANA SECURITIES, JAKARTA
 ""This is largely in line with our expectations.
 ""But price pressure is likely to increase in June, July and
August. June is the month for school enrolments, so there will
likely be pressure from higher school fees. There will also be
higher price pressure due to the Eid al-Fitr celebrations.
 ""We expect price pressure in the second half. We forecast
year-end inflation at 5.8 percent.
 ""There will also likely be upward price pressure from
expected stronger economic performance. We forecast interest
rates at 7 percent by the end of the fourth quarter.""
 DAVID SUMUAL, ECONOMIST, BCA
 ""This is within market expectations, but it will not make
the central bank raise the interest rate. However, I think for
Q3 and Q4, inflation will accelerate, especially due to an
electricity price hike and petrol subsidy adjustment.
 ""This number shows that inflation is creeping up, I suspect
from processed food.
 ""It will also depend on the external situation, Europe's
financial crisis. If the crisis continues then Indonesia may
maintain the interest rate (at 6.5 percent). Our forecast
remains unchanged: at the end of year, the interest rate at 7
percent and inflation at 5.5 percent.""
 WELLIAN WIRANTO, ASIAN ECONOMIST, HSBC, SINGAPORE
 ""Overall, this is basically still a very tame number for
Indonesia. For many months now there has been not surprisingly
low inflation.
 ""It hasn't changed our view that Bank Indonesia will keep
the rate unchanged this week. We see them hiking rates by 25
basis points at the end of this year. Our current forecast is
7.5 percent by the end of this year but if inflation continues
to be tame then obviously BI might be able to push it back
further into 2011.
 ""Overall we don't expect any huge increase in policy rate
at all. The rupiah is acting as a shield to deflect inflation.
It's not a coincidence and it's one of the things that the BI
is looking out for.
 ""The rupiah will be a factor of global risk appetite. BI is
in a strong position in terms of credibility as it has sizeable
reserves.
 ""Our currency forecast team has [the rupiah] at 8,800 (per
dollar) by the end of the year. Going by their forecast, I
think we will see a trend towards a strengthening rupiah
because of the fundamentals. But if the economy still has
strong fundamentals without any big pickup in inflation then BI
will have the space to continue providing support to growth by
keeping rates low.""
 MARKET REACTION:
 - The rupiah  was little changed at 9,213 per dollar
as of 0501 GMT, from 9,205 before the announcement.
 - Indonesia's composite index <.JKSE> weakened slightly
after the announcement, and was down 1.26 percent.

 BACKGROUND:
 - A Reuters poll had expected Indonesia's annual inflation
to have risen slightly to 4.20 percent in May from 3.91 percent
in April, on higher food price pressure.
 - The central bank targets year-end inflation at 4-6
percent and has indicated that it would keep its record low
interest rate of 6.5 percent unchanged this year.
 - Analysts, however, expect inflation pressures to build in
the second half of the year, prompting Bank Indonesia to raise

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday towards a
four-year low against the dollar, hurt by fears that the region's
sovereign debt problems may spread to the banking system, while
the Australian dollar dropped after weak building data.
 Approvals for building new Australian homes dived in April,
backing bets the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would not raise
interest rates anytime soon.
 The central bank is announcing its rate decision at 0430 GMT
and it expected to keep rates on hold at 4.5 percent.
 But investors are waiting to hear its assessment of the
balance of risks, given the euro-area debt crisis has become a
far more destabilising factor to global growth than earlier
thought.
 ""Investors are watching whether the RBA becomes more dovish,""
said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the foreign asset department
at Okasan Securities.
 ""The RBA is drawing lots of attention as Australia is the
only place investors feel really comfortable about putting their
money as Europe has its debt crisis and as there are signs of
economic bubbles in some emerging countries.""
 Any hint that the central bank may hold interest rates steady
for the coming months could prompt investors to further trim risk
assets, hurting the Australian dollar and other higher-yielding
currencies, traders said.
 The European Central Bank on Monday warned that euro zone
banks faced up to 195 billion euros in a ""second wave"" of
potential loan losses over the next 18 months due to the
financial crisis, and said it had increased purchases of
euro-zone government bonds.
 ""Over the next 18 months calm water could turn turbulent in
the blink of an eye,"" RBC Capital senior currency analyst David
Watt wrote in a note. ""Accordingly, euro rallies seem likely to
remain rather shallow and in that regard it is struggling to
maintain the $1.23 handle.""
 The euro was down 0.4 percent at $1.2263, hovering above a
four-year low of $1.2143 struck on May 19. Near-term support is
seen around $1.2140, the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
currency's 2000-08 advance.
 Traders said investors were looking at every bounce in the
single currency to sell. Against the yen, the euro fell 0.3
percent to 111.73 yen.
 Speculators and funds have gone short on the euro in droves
in recent months with the latest data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission suggesting they were still wary of cutting
those positions.
 The dollar inched down 0.2 percent against the yen to
91.08 yen.
 But the dollar index edged up 0.2 percent to 86.72, supported
by safe-haven inflows amid growing worries about the
sustainability of a global recovery.
 Underlining those economic risks, China warned on Monday that
global growth remained vulnerable to sovereign debt risks and the
possibility of a second downturn.
 Data showed on Tuesday China's official purchasing managers'
index (PMI) fell to 53.9 in May from 55.7 in April. The reading
was in line with the median forecast and marked the 15th straight
month that the PMI has stood above the threshold of 50 that
demarcates expansion from contraction.
 The Australian dollar slid 0.7 percent to $0.8398. Against
the yen, the Australian dollar dropped 1 percent to 76.47 yen.
 Cross/yen was hit after news that Argentina extended the
deadline for its debt swap by two weeks on Monday, hurting
sentiment towards emerging economies.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, June 1 (Reuters) - The euro and Asian stocks
slipped on Tuesday on creeping suspicion that a peak in the
recovery has passed and slowing growth in China and Europe in
the second half of the year will be obstacles to risky trades.
 Major European stock futures were down 0.6 percent,
indicating a slightly lower open, with traders looking
cautiously at declines in Chinese manufacturing gauges and BP's
attempt to plug a disastrous oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico
failed.
 After the most volatile month of trading since the wake of
Lehman Brothers' failure in the fall of 2008, investors now
focused on pricing in to what extent reduced demand from the
more fiscally austere euro zone would hit production in
economies like China and South Korea.
 Dealers brushed aside stronger-than-expected May export
growth figures from Korea, which precede the rest of Asia, and
solid Australian retail sales, taking more interest in
forward-looking manufacturing indexes from China and India.
 Indian factory activity was at a 27-month high in May, a
private sector index showed. However, growth in China's factory
output slowed and hiring eased in response to a critical drop
in new orders, an official survey showed.
 ""The result indicates weakening of momentum in the
manufacturing sector and confirms our expectation that GDP
growth will slow sharply in Q2 and continue decelerating in
Q3,"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist with SJS
Markets in Hong Kong, said in a note.
 The Australian dollar held on to most of its losses on the
day after the Reserve Bank of Australia stood pat on rates and
said after a policy meeting they would remain unchanged in the
near term. The RBA said global growth would be close to trend
this year, although the euro sovereign debt crisis meant
continued weakness in Europe.
 The Canadian dollar was largely unchanged before an
expected rate rise from the Bank of Canada that would make it
the first G7 central bank to tighten policy after the financial
crisis.
 CYCLICAL SECTORS UNDER FIRE
 Declines in equity markets were modest, though cyclical
sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary appeared
more vulnerable to selling pressure.
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.6 percent, with Fast
Retailing, which owns the Uniqlo casual clothing line, leading
the index lower.
 The Nikkei tumbled 11.7 percent in May, the largest monthly
drop since a 23.8 percent plunge in October 2008.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks, which has
been underperforming world equity markets so far this year,
fell 1.1 percent, with the consumer discretionary sector the
biggest drag.
 U.S. stock futures were down 0.4 percent after a long
holiday weekend in the United States and Britain.
 There were more than enough reasons to keep winding down
portfolio risk, especially after the European Central Bank
warned overnight of a ""second wave"" of writedowns at lenders of
up to 195 billion euros.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent to $1.2275, about a cent and
a half away from a four-year low hit against the dollar last
month. The currency is down 14 percent so far this year.
 Traders were not in a mood to sell Treasuries or gold, with
risk reduction still the order of the day. The benchmark yield
on the U.S. 10-year note was at 3.30 percent, down around 50
basis points since the end of March when fears about Europe's
fiscal health picked up.
 Gold climbed 0.4 percent to $1,218 an ounce, having
rebounded about $45 in the past week.

 * Still 'grave concerns' about human rights in Russia
 * Joint modernisation drive launched, but short on details

(Recasts after closing briefings)
 By Conor Humphries
 ROSTOV-ON-DON, Russia, June 1 (Reuters) - EU leaders hailed
warming ties with the Kremlin at a summit on Tuesday, but warned
that Moscow was falling short in its bid to achieve the modern,
democratic state President Dmitry Medvedev has called for.
 At the end of two days of talks filled with friendly words,
but marred by a police crackdown on opposition protesters, EU
President Herman Van Rompuy said Europe retained grave concerns
about human rights in Russia and called for swift reforms.
 ""The modernisation of Russia has to become reality ... With
Russia, we do not need a 'reset'. We want a 'fast forward',"" Van
Rompuy said, referring to President Barack Obama's attempts to
'reset' U.S. relations with Moscow.
 Relations between Moscow and Brussels have improved sharply
in recent months after a dramatic reconciliation between Russia
and Poland, but the two-day summit in the southern Russian city
of Rostov-on-Don exposed the limits to cooperation.
 The two sides officially launched a Programme for
Modernization under which the EU has promised to provide
investment, training and technology in return for reforms to
open up Russia's economy and society.
 But there was no clear progress on demands that the EU
reduce visa barriers to Russians visiting Europe and open
strategic European firms to Russian investment.
 
 CIVIL REFORMS
 And the EU made clear it was not satisfied with Medvedev's
efforts to boost human rights and civil society in Russia.
 ""The situation for human rights defenders and journalists in
Russia is of grave concern to the European public at large,"" Van
Rompuy said at a briefing after his first twice-yearly Russian
summit as EU president.
 Human rights and democracy have long been a thorn in ties
between Russia and the West, although tensions have eased
somewhat since Medvedev took over from Vladimir Putin in 2008
with a pledge to boost civil society.
 Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch (HRW) urged the EU not to let Medvedev off lightly.
 At the start of talks on Tuesday, Van Rompuy suggested
Russia must expand democracy in order to modernise.
 ""Your choice to base Russia's modernisation in the 21st
century on democratic values and building a modern economy
implies significant development,"" Van Rompuy said.
 But Van Rompuy voiced no criticism of Russia's
uncompromising handling of opposition protests that took place
in Moscow and St Petersburg during a summit dinner on Monday
evening. More than 150 people were detained..
 On the financial front, Medvedev praised European efforts to
solve the EU financial crisis.
 He reminded EU leaders that 41 percent of Russia's $450
billion in currency reserves are held in euros, but did not
offer any assurances that Russia would not sell some.

 MODERNISATION
 Medvedev, who has made modernisation and innovation
watchwords of his presidency, says European technology is needed
to wean the economy, which slumped 7.9 percent last year, off
its reliance on energy exports.
 For its part, the EU is hoping to boost trade with Russia.
 After rising for nearly a decade, EU exports to Russia fell
sharply during the financial crisis, dropping to 66 billion
euros ($80 billion) last year from 105 billion euros in 2008.
 The summit declaration announced the official launch of the
Programme for Modernisation. But it gave no deadlines, saying
that the sides were ""committed to working together to address
common challenges with a balanced and result-oriented approach"".
 Before the summit, Russian officials expressed impatience at
the lack of progress in securing visa-free travel to Europe for
Russians, two decades after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
 But the EU refused to set a date for an agreement. ""We
remain committed to making concrete progress as soon as possible
on the ground,"" Van Rompuy said. 
 The Kremlin has watched in frustration as, despite the
post-Soviet economic recovery, the EU scrapped visa requirements
for poorer states such as Bosnia and Albania, but not Russia.
 EU officials fear dropping visas could spark a wave of
overstayers and a backlash among voters in western Europe.

 TORONTO, May 31 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar rallied on
Monday after stellar quarterly growth figures added to
expectations that Canada will be the first Group of Seven
country to raise interest rates since the global recession.
 The currency firmed after data showed Canada's economy
expanded at the fastest clip in more than a decade in the first
quarter, with consumer spending and a hot housing market
helping boost gross domestic product by 6.1 percent at an
annual rate. [ID:nN31253710]
 The Canadian dollar  jumped to a session high of
C$1.0414, or 96.02 U.S. cents, shortly after the report, its
strongest level since May 19.
 ""The risk backdrop was minorly favorable for the Canadian
dollar (overnight) and then that basically carried over into
the North American session with the stronger-than-expected GDP
numbers domestically, adding to that upward momentum,"" said
George Davis, chief technical analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
 But market watchers said trading was light given the U.S.
and British long weekends and a lack of direction from flat
overseas equity markets. [MKTS/GLOB]
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0435, or 95.83 U.S. cents, well up from Friday's
finish at C$1.0520 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.06 U.S. cents.
 Still, the currency was down nearly 2.7 percent on the
month.
 Overnight index swaps, which reflect market expectations
for the Bank of Canada's key rate, were pricing in an 84
percent probability of a 25 basis point hike on Tuesday.
 [ID:nN25118365]
 ""It seems like if anything, expectations of a bank hike are
gelling a little bit more in the market's eye and the GDP data
did nothing to sway that view,"" said Doug Porter, deputy chief
economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 Davis said that until the central bank's decision on
Tuesday morning, the Canadian dollar is likely to trade between
C$1.0400 to C$1.0500.
 Given that a rate hike is already largely priced into the
market, Davis said investors will be closely reading the Bank
of Canada's accompanying statement for clues on future moves.
 ""The tone of the accompanying statement will be probably a
more important factor then the actual announcement itself
assuming we get a rate hike,"" he said.
 ""If we don't get a rate hike then I certainly think the
Canadian dollar is at the risk of weakening.""
 BONDS FALL ON POSITIVE SENTIMENT
 Given the strong domestic data, growing rate hike
expectations and stabilizing equity markets, Canadian bond
yields edged higher across the curve.
 The two-year Canadian government bond  lost 25
Canadian cents to yield 1.848 percent, and the 10-year bond
 shed 50 Canadian cents to yield 3.36 percent.
 ""Some of those flight to quality gains that we saw last
week and the week before in the bond market are slowly starting
to unwind,"" Davis said.
 However, he added, similar to the FX markets, flows have
been extremely quiet. ""Everybody is just waiting to see what
happens tomorrow now.""

 * ECB discloses increased euro zone sovereign bond buying
 * Spain says will reform labour market even without accord
 * China says euro zone debt crisis poses global growth risk

(Updates with ECB on euro zone bank write-offs)
 By Krista Hughes and Paul Day
 FRANKFURT/MADRID, May 31 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank warned on Monday that euro zone banks face up to 195
billion euros in a ""second wave"" of potential loan losses over
the next 18 months due to the financial crisis, and disclosed it
had increased purchases of euro zone government bonds.
 As the euro recouped losses but remained on the back foot
after a cut in Spain's credit rating and China warned that the
global economy remained vulnerable to sovereign debt risks,
Spain assured investors it would reform its rigid labour market
even if employers and trade unions cannot agree.
 The ECB said euro zone banks would need to make provisions
for further losses this year of 90 billion euros, and 105
billion in 2011, on top of some 238 billion euros in bad debts
written off by the end of 2009. That was the first time it has
given an estimate for next year. 
 Although total write-downs from bad loans and securities
between 2007 and the end of 2010 were likely to be lower than
previously expected, the ECB said in its latest Financial
Stability Report, write-downs this year and next year would be
still larger if heightened sovereign debt risk and the impact of
government belt-tightening dragged down economic growth.
 The ECB began buying up mostly Greek, Portuguese and Spanish
bonds on May 3 in a contentious move to calm debt markets and
support an $1 trillion stabilisation package for the euro agreed
by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 The central bank said in a statement it had settled 35
billion euros in bond purchases by May 28, up from 26.5 billion
a week earlier. It did not detail the nationality of the debt
but ECB officials have said it is mostly from south European
countries hardest hit by financial market turmoil.
 The ECB acknowledged in its report that euro zone debt
tensions may force it to delay a phasing-out of cheap lending
operations designed to help banks through the financial crisis.
 After Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, the ECB
began offering euro zone banks unlimited, flate-rate loans in a
bid to revive inter-bank lending and keep credit flowing to the
real economy.
 ECB governing council member Axel Weber, president of
Germany's powerful Bundesbank, urged a tight cap on the bond
buying programme and said the extraordinary steps taken to ease
the euro zone debt crisis posed a risk to price stability.
 ""The purchases of government bonds in the secondary market
should not overshoot a tightly-capped limit,"" Weber said in a
speech prepared for delivery in Mainz, Germany. He did not
suggest a figure.
 Spain, the fourth-largest euro zone economy, saw its credit
rating downgraded a notch by Fitch Ratings agency from the
maximum AAA to AA+ late on Friday after a 15 billion euro
austerity programme squeaked through parliament by a single
vote.
 Market reaction to the downgrade was limited, partly because
U.S. and British markets were closed for holidays on Monday. 
 The euro recouped losses incurred after the Spanish debt
downgrade to trade at around $1.23 but remained on the back foot
as the downgrade highlighted ongoing structural weaknesses in
the euro zone. The 10-year Spanish-German bond spread widened
only slightly but Spanish stocks fell 0.7 percent while the
index of leading European shares gained 0.4 percent.
 
 LABOUR REFORM
 Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado told a conference in
Madrid that the government aimed to pass a much anticipated
labour market reform by the end of June with or without
consensus with the unions and business representatives.
 The minority Socialist administration extended the deadline
for an agreement by one week from Monday but officials have said
the social partners are still far apart.
 The left-leaning daily El Pais said the government planned
to allow companies to make greater use of cheap work contracts
for a broader range of employees, reducing redundancy payments
and making it easier to fire workers.
 Trade unions have threatened to strike if the government
imposes the reform by royal decree, a move that would set the
ruling Socialists on a collision course with their traditional
allies in organised labour.
 In a sign of continued international concern about the
impact of Europe's problems, China warned that Europe's struggle
to contain ballooning debt posed a risk to global economic
growth, raising the spectre of a double-dip recession.
 Premier Wen Jiabao, addressing business leaders during an
official visit to Japan, issued his warnings a day after France
admitted it would struggle to keep its top credit rating.
 ""Some countries have experienced sovereign debt crises, for
example Greece. Is this kind of phenomenon over? Now it seems
that it's not so simple,"" Wen said. ""The sovereign debt crisis
in some European countries may drag down Europe's economic
recovery."" 
 He added it was too early to wind down stimulus deployed
during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
 Governments around the world ran up record debts during the
$5 trillion effort to pull the economy out of its deepest slump
since the Great Depression and now face a tough balancing act:
how to reduce debt without choking off growth.
 ECB Governing Council Member Mario Draghi warned that
austerity programmes by European governments could snuff out a
fragile recovery unless they were coordinated internationally.
 Economic sentiment in the euro zone fell in May, defying
analysts expectations of a slight improvement, in part due to
the wave of austerity announcements.
 However, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the economy
may expand more than expected in the second quarter.
 The fact that not just fiscally weak southern European
countries, but also nations such as France and Germany at the
euro zone's core are under pressure to cut debt and deficits
amassed during the financial crisis, is adding to concerns.

 (Recasts with ECB bond buying, Spanish labour plans)
 By Krista Hughes and Paul Day
 FRANKFURT/MADRID, May 31 (Reuters) - The European Central
Bank disclosed increased purchases of euro zone government bonds
on Monday as Spain assured investors it would reform its rigid
labour market even if employers and trade unions cannot agree.
 The ECB began buying up mostly Greek, Portuguese and Spanish
bonds on May 3 in a disputed action to help stabilise the euro
zone and support an emergency $1 trillion package agreed by the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 The central bank said in a statement it had settled 35
billion euros in bond purchases by May 28, up from 26.5 billion
a week earlier. It did not detail the nationality of the debt
but ECB officials have said it is mostly from south European
countries hardest hit by financial market turmoil.
 ECB governing council member Axel Weber, president of
Germany's powerful Bundesbank, urged a tight cap on the bond
buying programme and said the extraordinary steps taken to ease
the euro zone debt crisis posed a risk to price stability.
 ""The purchases of government bonds in the secondary market
should not overshoot a tightly-capped limit,"" Weber said in a
speech prepared for delivery in Mainz, Germany. He did not
suggest a figure.
 Spain, the fourth largest euro zone economy, saw its
credit rating downgraded a notch by Fitch Ratings agency from
the maximum AAA to AA+ late on Friday after a 15 billion euro
austerity programme squeaked through parliament by a single
vote.
 Market reaction to the downgrade was limited, partly because
U.S. and British markets were closed for holidays on Monday. 
 The euro recouped losses incurred after the Spanish debt
downgrade to trade at around $1.23. The 10-year Spanish-German
bond spread widened only slightly but Spanish stocks fell 0.7
percent while the index of leading European shares gained 0.4
percent.
 
 LABOUR REFORM WHATEVER
 Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado told a conference in
Madrid that the government aimed to pass a much anticipated
labour market reform by the end of June with or without
consensus with the unions and business representatives.
 The minority Socialist administration extended the deadline
for an agreement by one week from Monday but officials have said
the social partners are still far apart.
 The left-leaning daily El Pais said the government planned
to allow companies to make greater use of cheap work contracts
for a broader range of employees, reducing redundancy payments
and making it easier to fire workers.
 Trade unions have threatened to strike if the government
imposes the reform by royal decree, a move that would set the
ruling Socialists on a collision course with their traditional
allies in organised labour.
 In a sign of continued international concern about the
impact of Europe's problems, China warned that Europe's struggle
to contain ballooning debt posed a risk to global economic
growth, raising the spectre of a double-dip recession.
 Premier Wen Jiabao, addressing business leaders during an
official visit to Japan, issued his warnings a day after France
admitted it will struggle to keep its top credit rating.
 ""Some countries have experienced sovereign debt crises, for
example Greece. Is this kind of phenomenon over? Now it seems
that it's not so simple,"" Wen said. ""The sovereign debt crisis
in some European countries may drag down Europe's economic
recovery."" 
 He added it was too early to wind down stimulus deployed
during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
 Governments around the world ran up record debts during the
$5 trillion effort to pull the economy out of its deepest slump
since the Great Depression and now face a tough balancing act:
how to reduce debt without choking off growth.
 ECB governing council member Mario Draghi warned that
austerity programmes by European governments could snuff out a
fragile recovery unless they were coordinated internationally.
 ""These are difficult courses of action and unless
coordinated at the international level they risk extinguishing
the hesitant economic recovery,"" he said.
 As if on cue, economic sentiment in the euro zone fell in
May, defying analysts expectations of a slight improvement, in
part due to the wave of austerity announcements.
 However, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the economy
may expand more than expected in the second quarter.
 The fact that not just the fiscally weakest southern
European countries, but also nations at the euro zone's core are
under pressure to cut debt and deficits amassed during the
financial crisis, is adding to concerns.
 On Sunday, France said keeping its AAA credit rating would
be a stretch without some tough action on its deficit, while
Germany indicated it might resort to raising taxes to bring its
shortfall closer to the EU's limit of 3 percent of gross
domestic product.
 France, the euro zone's second-largest economy, expects the
budget deficit to hit 8 percent of GDP this year, but aims to
bring it down to the EU limit by 2013. Germany, Europe's biggest
economy, expects its deficit to exceed 5 percent of GDP in 2010.

 By Yelena Fabrichnaya and Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, May 31 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank cut
interest rates on Monday for the 14th time in a year-long easing
cycle and signalled a pause, saying policy should now be at a
level where loans are affordable and inflation is contained.
 A Reuters poll last week gave even chances of a rate cut or
of unchanged policy in May, making this month's decision the
most finely balanced one in the current cycle. [ID:nLDE64R15B
 The benchmark refinancing rate will be reduced by 25 basis
points to a new historic low of 7.75 percent effective from
Tuesday, taking the cumulative easing since April 2009 to 525
basis points.
 ""The parameters set ... create the conditions for the
formation of money market rates which will enable an acceptable
balance between the affordability of borrowing funds and
inflation risks,"" the central bank said in a statement.
 ""Consequently, the Bank of Russia thinks it likely that the
achieved level of interest rates will be maintained in the
coming months.""
 April economic data pointed to signs of a sturdier recovery
from recession, while banks' lending activity has finally picked
up, and rouble appreciation -- seen as another reason for past
central bank rate cuts -- ran out of steam.
 All were seen as reasons for rates being on hold this month,
while still-benign inflation levels supported the argument that
there was still room left for a bit more monetary easing.
 Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach on Monday forecast
May inflation at 0.2-0.3 percent on the month.
 ""It looks like the central bank focused to a greater extent
on ... inflation, which is quite favourable,"" said Yaroslav
Lissovolik, chief strategist at Deutsche Bank in Moscow.
 ""The fact that there is such instability on financial
markets may have eased the central bank's decision, which
stimulates the economy even more and compensates for the
negative impact of global markets.""
 The Russian stock market and the rouble have come under
pressure along with oil prices in recent weeks.
 The central bank said it was not concerned by the level of
rouble volatility and that the new level of rates should not
create significant reasons for capital inflows.
 Nikolai Podguzov, fixed income analyst at Renaissance
Capital, said ""a weaker rouble is more of a boon for the Russian
economy"" which will enable the central bank to take a breather.
 ""The central bank gave a pretty clear signal that at least
for 2-3 months, for the summer period, they are taking a pause
in cuts,"" he said, adding that hikes this year are unlikely,
while another cut is possible if inflation remains tame.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who has touted the fall in
inflation to its lowest in Russia's post-Soviet Union history as
a key success, on Monday called on private companies to help the
government to keep prices in check.
 The central bank statement came after the close of rouble
trade on Russia's MICEX exchange. News of the cut could add
pressure on the rouble, but markets will likely take heart from
the chances that policy will now remain on hold for a while at
levels which still leave yields attractive compared to many
developed and emerging economies.
 For the first time in recent months, the rate move was not
uniform, with overnight deposit rates -- a key barometer for
interbank rates -- left on hold at 2.50 percent.
 The central bank also issued a separate statement revising
the fixed Lombard rates set for June 1 operations, which had
earlier been announced at unchanged levels. (Additional

 (Adds economist quotes)
 COPENHAGEN, May 31 (Reuters) - Denmark's gross domestic
product grew by a bigger-than-expected 0.6 percent in the first
quarter of 2010 from the previous quarter, marking a third
consecutive quarter of recovery, official data showed.
 First-quarter GDP was still down 0.4 percent from the same
quarter last year, Statistics Denmark said on Monday.
 The Danish economy is clawing back from its deepest
recession since the Second World War. GDP shrank 5.1 percent in
2009 from the previous year.
 ""Against the background of today's figures, the conclusion
must be that the upturn is taking hold in the domestic economy,""
Nordea Markets global chief economist Helge Pedersen said.
 Economists in a Reuters survey had expected GDP to increase
0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter and to show a 0.9 percent drop
from the same quarter last year. [ID:nLDE64R17P]
 ""Today's numbers were a positive surprise, particularly as
jobs are also being created in the Danish economy now,"" Danske
Bank chief economist Steen Bocian said.
 Investment fell in the first quarter, but there was an
increase in both private and public consumption, Statistics
Denmark said in a statement, adding that imports and exports
also grew.
 Jes Asmussen, chief economist at Handelsbanken Capital
Markets, said that increased disposable income had fed through
into private consumption which was one of the main drivers of
growth in the quarter.
 ""One of the reasons for the more positive growth
development, however, is also to be found in a positive
contribution from net exports,"" he said.
 ""The export sector has begun to follow the positive efects
of stabilisation and growth in global trade,"" Asmussen added.
 The finance ministry this month bumped up its forecast for
GDP growth this year to 1.4 percent from a previous 1.3 percent
and its 2011 forecast to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent.
[ID:nDKT004980]
 Asmussen said that the year-on-year drop in first-quarter
GDP despite three sequential quarters of recovery reflected how
hard the Danish economy was hit by the crisis and showed that
Denmark has lagged peer economies in recovery.
 The question now, Asmussen said, is how the rolling back of
fiscal stimulus will affect the recovery ahead, not only in
Denmark but throughout the Western world.

 * Falloff in remittances seen hitting growth, currencies
 * Returning migrants struggle to find jobs at home 
 
 By Luiza Ilie
 BUCHAREST, May 31 (Reuters) - Eastern Europeans working
abroad are sending less money home this year, severing a
lifeline for hundreds of small towns and slowing the recovery in
some of Europe's poorest emerging economies.
 Analysts say exact calculations for how much the slump may
shave off GDP across the region are hard to pin down. However,
in one of the region's biggest economies, Romania, they make up
3 percent of GDP and fell by a third in the first quarter after
a similar drop last year.
 Neighbouring Bulgaria has also seen a slide and analysts
expect other diasporas to send less funds to Southeast Europe
this year.
 The trend is an example of how weak recovery in the euro
zone will impact poorer eastern European states who depend on
remittances, hurting an important growth factor, driving up
external imbalances and putting pressure on currencies.
 ""When I arrived in Spain seven years ago people were
knocking on your door at all hours to give you a job,"" said
Cristian Moldovan, 32, who returned to his small central
Romanian town of Campina in December.
 ""Now you're knocking on theirs, but they don't have any.""
 With unemployment at 20 percent in Spain and 9 percent in
Italy, where most Romanian migrants have found jobs, analysts
say the fall in remittances would worsen and spread across the
region in countries ranging from Albania to Poland.
 Returning migrants are also expected to struggle to find
jobs in mostly recession-hit countries that must enforce fiscal
cuts to address large structural deficits.
 ""With a falloff in the inflows eastern European migrants
send home there are risks to current account deficits and
exchange rates,"" said Eurasia Group analyst Jon Levy.
 ""More directly, it just means families have diminished
purchasing power ... in many cases remittances are probably
pretty integral to just the ability to provide housing.""
 
 RETURN TO SENDER
 Remittances account for roughly 3 percent of gross domestic
product in Romania and Bulgaria, and less than half that figure
in Poland. But they reach up to 27 percent in smaller countries
like Moldova, Bosnia and Albania, meaning their plunge is a real
threat to economic growth.
 Roughly 800,000 Albanians of the state's 1.2 million
emigrants have jobs in Greece, mainly in construction, farming
and tourism, the largest number of foreign workers there.
 But as the Greek government enforces sharp cuts, leading to
violent protests and an expected economic contraction of 4
percent this year, many Albanians are returning home.
 For decades Eastern Europeans were driven abroad by dying
local industries, ethnic wars and poverty. Their savings helped
families back home buy houses and start businesses.
 The cash helped strengthen currencies and served as a
counterbalance to widening external shortfalls, but it also
drove up real estate prices and fuelled an imports-dependent
consumption boom that further widened imbalances.
 Falling remittances added to woes caused by investor flight
at the height of the global financial crisis that prompted
Romania, Serbia, Ukraine and others to seek aid from the
International Monetary Fund.
 The bailout helped stabilise the leu currency 
after it fell to a multi-year low of 4.35 per euro at the start
of last year, but analysts said depreciation pressure was rising
again as the external shortfall flared up in the first quarter.
 ""Funding for a bigger current account deficit will be
tighter and more reliant on other, less predictable investment
inflows,"" said Raffaella Tenconi, an economist at Wood&Co.
 Tenconi has halved her forecast for net transfers to Romania
-- most of which are remittances -- to 2-2.5 billion euros for
this year, and said the overall current account gap would grow
from last year's roughly 5 billion euros.
 
 UPSIDE
 Net remittances to Romania fell from 950 million euros to
620 million euros in the first quarter, adding to a plunge of 35
percent in 2009.
 Bulgarian remittances fell 11 percent. Its diaspora of 1
million hold jobs mainly in Greece, Spain and Italy. Other
eastern European states have yet to release first-quarter data.
 World Bank experts predict global remittances will recover
and rise some 6 percent this year to $437 billion due to better
world growth prospects. They say Europe and central Asia, which
last year had the sharpest drop at 21 percent will also rise.
 But analysts warn that recovery in western Europe was
unlikely to bring back remittances to levels before the crisis.
 Moldovan, who returned in December has found a job as a
distributor only three weeks ago. The pay is one tenth of what
he made working on farms and at gas stations in Spain and
significantly below the unemployment aid he received there.
 ""There is no comparing here to there,"" he said. ""I don't
know if we could ever catch up to them.""

552,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2010 09:19AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-WTO questions China's export barriers," * Export curbs not economically effective for conservation
 * Can give advantage to domestic producers
 * No comment on yuan rate

(Adds U.S. comments)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 31 (Reuters) - China's curbs on exports of some
raw materials to conserve resources may not meet the stated
goals while giving Chinese manufacturers an unfair advantage,
the World Trade Organization said on Monday.
 The remarks, in a report prepared for China's two-yearly
trade policy review, constituted a rare comment by the WTO's
secretariat on a current dispute between members.
 By cutting off exports of some raw materials, China makes
them more expensive for foreign manufacturers who use them while
making them cheaper for its own processing industry, which is
able to sell finished goods abroad more cheaply than foreign
competitors can.
 China's restrictions on raw materials sales have been
challenged by the United States, European Union and Mexico, and
the WTO set up a panel in December to rule on the complaints.
 The WTO noted that China has continued to open its markets
since joining the global trade body in 2001, and its average
tariff is now 9.5 percent against 9.7 percent in 2007.
 But it said export barriers have not fallen as fast as
import barriers.
 China uses restrictions such as prohibitions, licensing,
quotas, taxes and partial tax rebates to manage certain exports
in order to conserve resources and energy, it said.
 The report questioned whether this approach was economically
effective, and noted that such restraints tend to reduce export
volumes of the targeted products, diverting supplies to the
domestic market and depressing their domestic prices.
 ""Export restraints... may implicitly assist domestic
downstream processing of the products concerned,"" it said.
 
 EXTERNAL/DOMESTIC BALANCE
 WTO officials are normally reluctant to comment on issues
that are subject to litigation for fear of influencing the
outcome, and the report steered a discreet path around other
disputes involving China.
 It refrained from any recommendation on China's currency,
whose level concerns the United States and some other trading
partners. It noted that when the International Monetary Fund had
last examined it, some IMF directors had agreed that the yuan
was substantially undervalued, while the central bank wants to
keep the rate basically stable.
 The report was prepared on April 26 but released only on
Monday for the start of the three-day review of trade policies
at the world's biggest exporter and second-biggest importer.
 China was making greater use of trade actions such as duties
on unfairly priced imports, while itself remaining the most
frequent target of such anti-dumping measures, it said.
 Since 2008 China has been involved in four disputes as a
complainant and 11 as a defendant, it said.
 The United States said it disagreed with the WTO report's
statement that China was continuing to open its economy, saying
that progress towards liberalisation had slowed since 2006.
 ""In the United States' view, China has become much more
focused on developing industrial policy initiatives aimed at
helping Chinese enterprises move up the value chain in key
industries, and China has demonstrated a highly selective
interest in continuing to open its market more fully and fairly
to foreign participation,"" U.S. ambassador to the WTO Michael
Punke said in a statement at the review.
 Besides export restrictions, Punke cited special Chinese
standards, ""Buy China"" procurement policies, a postal law
excluding foreign suppliers from much of express delivery
services, restrictions on supplying telecoms or entering the
telecoms market and limits on foreign investment.
 The United States wants China to do more to protect
intellectual property rights, despite recent efforts, and
services including banking, insurance, telecoms, electronic
payments, express delivery and law are still subject to high
levels of state control and lack of competition, he said.

fell on Wednesday after Israeli marines stormed a convoy of
Gaza-bound aid ships but traders said any impact was likely to
be short-lived and limited.
 The blue-chip Tel Aviv 25 index was down 1.8 percent to
1081.02 points at 1255 GMT while the broader TA-100 was off 1.7
percent.
 Bond prices were marginally lower while the shekel was
trading at 3.867 per dollar, compared with Friday's official
rate of 3.829. There will be no official rates set on Monday due
to holidays abroad.
 Israeli marines stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza
and 10 pro-Palestinian activists were killed, triggering a
profound diplomatic crisis.
 Israel's allies in Europe, as well as the United Nations and
Turkey, voiced shock and outrage at the bloody end to a bid by
international campaigners to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza
Strip. Its navy stopped six ships ferrying 700 people and 10,000
tonnes of supplies toward the Islamist-run Palestinian enclave.
 ""What you are seeing today is partially influenced by the
geopolitical events of the day but in addition, local
institutions are stil digesting the MSCI upgrade last week,""
said a trader in Tel Aviv.
 ""There was a surprise with a heavy sell side influence on
Wednesday, people were expecting to see a bit more of a boost.
Local institutions are taking stock of events.""
 Index compiler MSCI last Wednesday upgraded Israel to
developed-market status from emerging market, including Israel
in its World Index and its EAFE Index. Passive investors in
emerging markets sold Israeli holdings in the run-up to the
change.
 A currency dealer at Israel Discount Bank said 100 percent
of the weaker shekel was due to the fallout from the Gaza convoy
but stressed that holidays in London and New York had kept
liquidity low.
 The stocks trader said he believed about half of the
market's decline on Monday was due to the attack on the aid
ships.
 ""I don't think the market will be impacted by this beyond
the next 24-48 hours,"" he added.
Shares in Elbit Systems, Israel's largest publicly traded
defence company, were down 1.6 percent at 196.4 shekels in late
trade.
 ""Elbit's investor base is largely domestic, If foreigners
sell locals will come in to buy,"" the trader said. ""There are
some questions about future contracts with Turkey but Turkey is
only a small part of Elbit's business.""
 The Discount currency dealer said he expected the shekel to
remain weak, especially since dollar-shekel had broken above a
key resistance level of 3.8150.
 ""It's been a bad month for the world but Israel was seen as
a safe haven,"" the dealer said. ""But this (flotilla incident)
was a reminder that we still live in the Middle East.""

(Adds cbank comments, markets)
 By Gergely Szakacs and Sandor Peto
 BUDAPEST, May 31 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank kept its
main interest rate  on hold at a record low of 5.25
percent  on Monday, halting a long series of cuts due
to increased global uncertainty and inflation risks.
 The bank has cut rates by a combined 425 basis points since
July to help the recession-hit economy return to growth, mindful
of a crisis of confidence on its currency and bond markets that
drove it to seek an IMF-led bailout in 2008.
 A negative shift in global sentiment over euro zone debt
woes, a deterioration in the risk assessment of Hungarian
assets, inflation risks and uncertainty over the new Hungarian
government's fiscal policy have made the bank cautious.
 ""In light of increased perceptions of risk associated with
Hungarian financial assets and inflation risks, the Monetary
Council has decided to leave interest unchanged,"" the rate
setting panel said in a statement.
 But it left the window open for more easing.
 ""Interest rates may only be reduced further if the outlook
for inflation as well as perceptions of risk allow,"" it added.
 The decision to pause was in line with the majority of
analysts in a Reuters poll  last week -- 17 of 23
forecast no change. Six had predicted a 25 basis point reduction
but the forint  and bonds saw little reaction to the
decision.
 The currency has weakened 4 percent since the last meeting
while government bond yields are 70-100 basis points up from
multi-year lows hit last month.
 Analysts see the base rate at 5.0 percent at the end of this
year.
 Governor Andras Simor told a news conference the decision
had a ""convincing majority"" in the 7-member Council, which
discussed two options: holding rates and cutting by a further 25
basis points.
 
 UNCERTAINTY
 The bank revised its price forecasts upwards for both 2010
and 2011 in its inflation report and expected inflation to fall
to around its 3 percent target in the first half of 2011.
[ID:nBUS002139]
 It also revised its growth projection upwards for this year
and now sees the economy expanding by 0.9 percent after a 6.3
percent contraction last year.
 Another factor worrying investors is the new government's
warning that the 2010 budget deficit would be way above the 3.8
percent target agreed under the IMF bailout as well as attacks
on the central bank itself by ministers. [ID:nLDE63S24A]
 Analysts have urged the cabinet to present a clear economic
plan [ID:nLDE64Q166] and the bank on Monday warned about the
need for fiscal sustainability.
 ""Considering that fiscal sustainability has become the focus
of international investors' attention, it is particularly
important to maintain disciplined, long-term sustainable fiscal
policies. This is especially relevant for countries with high
debt levels, such as Hungary,"" it said in a statement.
 The finances of Central European states are in much better
shape than in the euro zone periphery but Hungary's public debt
is the highest in the region at around 80 percent of GDP.
 The bank expects this year's budget deficit at 4.3-4.5
percent of GDP.

 * Analysts say euro to stay under pressure
 * Currencies little changed in holiday-thinned market

(Adds comment, updates throughout)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro inched up on Monday,
recouping small losses incurred after a cut to Spain's debt
rating, but the currency remained on the back foot as the
downgrade highlighted ongoing structural weaknesses in the euro
zone.
 A warning from China that the global economy remained
vulnerable to sovereign debt risks capped demand for higher-risk
currencies, while investors were wary of taking on big positions
given market holidays in the UK and the United States.
 Spain's downgrade by ratings agency Fitch on Friday tracked
a move by S&P last month, and analysts said the reaction from
currency markets had been limited as the cut had been widely
expected. [ID:nLDE64R25A]
 But many say the euro is poised for more losses after its
dramatic tumble this month given that structural problems remain
in some euro zone countries, while uncertainties about the scale
of the debt crisis in the region will keep investors jittery.
 ""I wouldn't draw the conclusion that because the markets
didn't react to the downgrade that the pressure isn't to the
downside on the euro,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""We don't have a solution for the debt crisis right now. The
pressure on the euro will remain.""
 By 1139 GMT, the euro  was little changed on the day
at $1.2290 in holiday-thinned European trade, regaining its
composure after a slide to $1.2263 on Friday, according to
Reuters data.
 Against a broadly weaker yen, it rose 0.7 percent to 112.40
yen.
 But a short-covering rally that had pushed the currency up
to around $1.2670 just a over week ago has petered out, the
latest IMM positioning data shows. [IMM/FX]
 Analysts said investors had already started to increase
short positions in the single currency, which may add to
increasing downward pressure in the coming weeks.
 ""The latest IMM data shows no significant reduction in short
euro positions, and we think that many speculators added to
short euro positions when we went higher (two weeks ago),"" said
John Hydeskov, senior currency analyst at Danske in Copehagen.
 He added that lack of follow-through in the euro's
short-covering rally was a reason for the pullback to $1.23.
 Even as the single currency looked set to have fallen around
7.5 percent against the dollar during May, European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet on Monday said the euro was a
""credible currency"" which was holding its value very well.

percent higher versus a currency basket, while it rose 0.5

(Adds Makuch comment)
 By Martin Santa and Marc Jones
 VIENNA/FRANKFURT, May 31 (Reuters) - European Central Bank
policymaker Axel Weber on Monday urged a tight cap on the bank's
government bond buying programme, saying extraordinary steps
taken to ease the debt crisis posed a risk to its main goal of
price stability.
 Despite figures showing a slump in economic sentiment as the
crisis crimps activity in the real economy, ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet said euro zone GDP may expand more than
expected in the second quarter though future growth was not
assured.
 The ECB abandoned a long-held resistance to buying
government debt early this month, helping to calm bond markets
and bring down borrowing costs for heavily-indebted Greece and
other financially strained euro zone members.
 Trichet defended the move as a necessary intervention while
a third ECB policymaker, Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi,
said the programme would end as soon as possible.
 But Weber, who has already gone public with his concerns,
urged a tight cap on buying.
 ""Monetary policy has taken new paths in the wake of the
crisis. I am critical of this because of the risks to policy
stability,"" Weber said in a speech prepared for delivery in
Mainz, Germany.
 To minimise the risk to price stability, he said the bond
buying had to be targeted precisely and tightly limited in
scale, though he did not give a number.
 ""The purchases of government bonds in the secondary market
should not overshoot a tightly-capped limit,"" he said.
 ""These operations should have the character of a bridge
facility until the financing facilities of the EU and special
purpose vehicles take over.""
 Fears about the finances of some euro zone countries,
notably Greece, Portugal and Spain, have driven a 15 percent
drop in the value of the euro since the start of the year.
 ECB Governing Council member Jozef Makuch said in Vienna on
Monday he was happy with the euro's current exchange rate
against the dollar, saying it was very close to fundamentals and
good for the euro zone's exports [ID:nDEP003316].
 Trichet said euro zone governments need to make a ""quantum
leap"" in improving budget oversight mechanisms to prevent
recurrences of bad fiscal behaviour.
 ""These are challenging times for Europe and for the ECB,""
Trichet told an Austrian central bank conference, warning the
bond buying was time-bound and would not allow countries to
sidestep the hard task of scaling back spending and mending
public finances.
 Trichet said the bond buying was not akin to printing money
-- so-called 'quantitative easing'. Like Weber he said it was
aimed purely at getting trading in the euro zone bonds in
question back up and running.
 Draghi said the buying would be discontinued ""as quickly as
possible, as soon as the markets resumed trading the securities
of the countries in question"".
 
 HIGHER GROWTH
 The OECD upped its forecasts for the euro zone's economic
growth last week and Trichet said the recovery now looked to be
stronger than previously expected.
 ECB money supply figures showed loans to euro zone
households hit a record high although lending to firms fell to
its lowest level in almost two years.
 ""Within the euro area, some recent data suggest a phenomenon
of a recovery in growth in the second quarter of 2010 that is
slightly higher than expected,"" Trichet said.
 However, future growth was not ""set in stone"".
 Euro zone economic sentiment fell sharply in May, reflecting
concerns that a broadening of the debt crisis begun in Greece
will stall bank lending and stop the recovery in its tracks.
 Asked in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde whether
the euro currency was in danger as a result of the current
trouble, Trichet jumped to its defence.
 ""The euro is a very credible currency which keeps its
value... The euro's capacity to maintain its value is absolutely
essential for the confidence of investors both inside and
outside the euro area,"" he said.
 Draghi warned that austerity programmes across the region
could snuff out the fragile recovery unless coordinated
internationally.

 * Can give advantage to domestic producers
 * No comment on yuan rate
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 31 (Reuters) - China's curbs on exports of some
raw materials to conserve resources may not meet the stated
goals while giving Chinese manufacturers an unfair advantage,
the World Trade Organization said on Monday.
 The remarks, in a report prepared for China's two-yearly
trade policy review, constituted a rare comment by the WTO's
secretariat on a current dispute between members.
 China's restrictions on raw materials sales have been
challenged by the United States, European Union and Mexico, and
the WTO set up a panel in December to rule on the complaints.
 The WTO noted that China has continued to open its markets
since joining the global trade body in 2001, and its average
tariff is now only 9.5 percent against 9.7 percent in 2007.
 But it said export barriers have not fallen as fast as
import barriers.
 China uses restrictions such as prohibitions, licensing,
quotas, taxes and partial tax rebates to manage certain exports
in order to conserve resources and energy, it said.
 The report questioned whether this approach was economically
effective, and noted that such restraints tend to reduce export
volumes of the targeted products, diverting supplies to the
domestic market and depressing their domestic prices.
 ""Export restraints... may implicitly assist domestic
downstream processing of the products concerned,"" it said.
 In other words, by cutting off exports of some raw
materials, China makes them more expensive for foreign
manufacturers who use them while making them cheaper for its own
domestic processing industry, which is thus able to sell its
finished goods abroad more cheaply than foreign competitors can.
 
 EXTERNAL/DOMESTIC BALANCE
 WTO officials are normally reluctant to comment on issues
that are subject to litigation for fear of influencing the
outcome, and the report steered a discreet path around other
disputes involving China.
 For instance it refrained from any recommendation on China's
currency, whose level concerns the United States and some other
trading partners. It noted that when the International Monetary
fund had last examined it, some IMF directors had agreed that
the yuan was substantially undervalued, while the central bank
wants to keep the rate basically stable.
 The report was prepared on April 26 but only released on
Monday for the start of the three-day review of trade policies
at the world's biggest exporter and second-biggest importer.
 China was making greater use of trade actions such as duties
on unfairly priced imports, while itself remaining the most
frequent target of such anti-dumping measures, it said.
 Since 2008 China has been involved in 4 disputes as a
complainant and 11 as a defendant, it said.
 The WTO said heavy reliance on manufacturing had resulted in
over-investment and excess capacity in some industries which
became obvious when external demand fell, leading to a 16
percent fall in exports in 2009. Chinese exports have rebounded
this year.
 This over-investment was partly due to the absence of a
proper capital market, monetary policy that is not fully based
on market instruments, and government guidance in allocating
resources, it said.
 A better balance between external and domestic demand to
drive growth, and further liberalisation of import and export
policies would strengthen China's ability to work with other
countries to manage trade and economic imbalances, it said.
 It said the crisis has reinforced China's intention to
undertake longer-term structural reforms.
 These include strengthening domestic demand by strengthening
social safety nets, reducing household precautionary savings,
diversifying the economy and developing capital markets to
reduce high enterprise savings.

 (Recasts with economists' comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 31 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment
defied market expectations of a small gain and fell sharply in
May, data showed on Monday, indicating that the euro zone debt
crisis has begun affecting the real economy.
 The European Commission said economic sentiment (ESI) in the
16 countries using the euro fell to 98.4 in May from 100.6 in
April while economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to
100.8 points.
 ""The worsening in economic confidence in May confirms that
the sovereign debt woes in the southern periphery have started
to spill over into the real economy,"" said Martin van Vliet,
economist at ING.
 ""Domestic recovery prospects in the euro zone are darkening.
Nevertheless, with May's index still well above Q1's average,
second-quarter GDP growth is still expected to be quite
flattering,"" van Vliet said.
 Prices of debt in some euro zone countries have been falling
sharply due to market concern over bloated public finances and
low growth rates, forcing governments to announce fiscal
austerity measures that are likely to slow growth further.
 The monthly Commission survey showed that sentiment in the
euro zone services sector fell to +3 from +6, to -18 from -15
among consumers and to -5 from -1 in the retail sector.
 Only sentiment in industry inched up to -6 from -7 which
economists said was thanks to strong demand for euro zone
exports.
 
 INFLATION UNDER CONTROL, RATES SEEN ON HOLD
 But second quarter economic growth was still likely to be
much better than the 0.2 percent in the first three months of
the year.
 ""We are back below the long-term average and the threat to
economic recovery has started to materialise, although we are
highly confident that Q2 GDP growth will be strong,"" said
Dominique Barbet, Senior Economist at BNP Paribas.
 But some economists noted that the May decline in sentiment
was also partly due to a methodological change, which the
Commission said had affected the magnitude of the decline, but
not the direction of the change.
 ""The outcome does not change the general sense that
confidence indicators in the euro zone have been resilient in
the face of the sovereign debt crisis, up until now,"" Nick Kounis
Chief European Economist at Fortis Bank Nederland.
 Separately, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat
estimated that euro zone inflation in May inched upwards as
expected in a Reuters poll of economists to 1.6 percent
year-on-year from a 1.5 percent rise in April.
 No monthly numbers or a detailed breakdown of the May
inflation is available yet -- the numbers will be published only
on June 16. The European Central Bank (ECB) wants to keep
inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term.
 ""It is likely that in May food prices continued to increase
at a higher pace; energy prices probably increased too, albeit
at a slower pace with respect to April,"" said Clemente de Lucia,
economist at BNP Paribas. 
 ""The fall in oil prices in US dollars more than compensated
the sharp fall of the euro. Over the month, oil prices decreased
by more then 3 euros,"" he said. ""However, there is no
inflationary threat at the horizon."" 
 The Commission survey also showed that selling price
expectations in industry rose to 7 from 5 in April and to 12
from 8 among consumers, which economists said was still well
below the ECB goal.
 ""We had already expected the ECB to delay raising interest
rates until early-2011 but it is looking ever more likely that
the bank will keep interest rates down at 1.0 percent until the
final months of next year,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS
Global Insight.
 The ECB said that lending to euro zone firms fell again in
April to its lowest level in almost two years and although loans
to households increased to a new record high, economists warned
against over-optimism.
 ""The April Eurozone money supply data indicate that
underlying inflationary pressures remain muted,"" Archer said. 
 ""Even allowing for muted demand from businesses for bank
credit, the lending data maintain concern that euro zone
recovery could be held back over the coming months by a
significant number of companies being unable to get the credit
that they need,"" he said.

565,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2010 07:03AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-IMX Resources sees profit in 2010/11," * Expects operating profit from 2010/11
 * Plans first iron/copper ore shipments to China by early Oct
 By Alison Leung
 HONG KONG, May 31 (Reuters) - Australia's IMX Resources
 will send its first iron ore shipment to China by early
October and expects to post its first operating profit in the
next financial year, senior executives said on Monday.
 Mining company IMX has projects in South Australia, Tasmania
and Tanzania in East Africa focussed on a range of commodities,
including iron ore, nickel, gold, copper and uranium.
 ""We should get our first revenue in around the end of
September, early October so for us that will be a historic day --
we change from an exploration company into a mining company,""
chairman Johann Jacobs told Reuters.
 Listed on the Australian stock exchange since 1996, IMX has
posted A loss every year except for 2008/09 when it made a small
profit as it sold a uranium royalty during the global financial
crisis.
 Based on current iron ore prices, IMX could make a pre-tax
profit of about A$30 million ($25.4 million) a year from its 50
percent stake in the first phase of the Cairn Hill iron and
copper mine in South Australia, Jacobs said.
 The ore would be processed by its buyer in China and IMX would
charge 80 percent of the spot prices that Rio Tinto 
 charges its customers for the iron output and 80 percent
of LME prices for copper output, he said.
 Production in the mine started earlier this month with a
projected output of 1.1 million tonnes for the year ending June
2011, ramping up to 1.7 million tonnes per year thereafter, said
Managing Director Duncan McBain, who was in Hong Kong for a
company road show.
 CHINESE PARTNERS
 IMX signed an agreement with China's Jilin Tonghua Iron &
Steel Group (Mining) Co Ltd, which will buy all output from the
first phase of the project, 55 km southeast of Australia's Coober
Pedy, for the entire five-year life of the mine.
 Jilin Tonghua Iron & Steel has a 7.1 percent stake in IMX and
Sichuan Taifeng Group holds 13 percent.
 IMX signed a A$49 million ($41.53 million) deal with Sichuan
Taifeng in January to fund development of the project. Sichuan
Taifeng will own half of the Cairn Hill project and its stake in
IMX will rise to 19.9 percent.
 ""We have probably spent the last four years in China looking
for the right partners,"" McBain said.
 The Sichuan Taifeng investment is pending Australian
government approval as the Cairn Hill project lies within the
Department of Defence-controlled Woomera protection area.
 Last year, Treasurer Wayne Swan blocked Chinese
government-controlled China Minmetals from buying Oz Minerals'
 Prominent Hill mine as it sat within the sensitive
defence area.
 McBain said he expected the investment to be approved by the
end of June as Sichuan Taifeng was not a state-owned company and
IMX already had a mining agreement with the Department of
Defence.
 Sichuan Taifeng also has an offtake agreement with IMX for
the second phase of the project. The second phase is purely iron
ore with a life of five years and is expected to start in 2012.
 Shares of IMX have fallen nearly 16 percent this month,
lagging a 9 percent drop on Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200
index <.AXJO>, after the Australian government proposed a 40
percent resources tax on mining companies. But IMX has
outperformed the index this year with a 1.2 percent gain against
the broader market's 8.8 percent fall.
 McBain said the resources tax was expected to be modified
substantially before it came to effect in 2012. In the proposal's
present form, though, it took money that could be reinvested out
of companies, he said.
 ""That forces us and others to go back to the market to raise
more money, go to the banks to get more debts or go to China to
get more money,"" he said.

 By Mike Peacock
 LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro steadied from recent
falls and world stocks were becalmed on Monday with a Chinese
warning about risks to global growth and a downgrade of Spain's
credit heightening investor caution in holiday-thinned trade.
 Europe's common currency inched up, recovering modest losses
suffered after a cut to Spain's sovereign debt rating late on
Friday, but the currency remained on the back foot as the
downgrade served as a reminder about the euro zone debt crisis.
 Fitch cut Spain's credit rating by one notch, saying its
recovery will be more muted than the government forecast due to
its austerity measures. The downgrade helped send Wall Street
lower ahead of a three-day weekend. [ID:nLDE64R1ZE]
 Analysts said the move had largely been priced in and Fitch
still rated it higher than fellow agency Standard & Poor's.
 ""It's just a reminder that the euro zone crisis hasn't gone
away. It's still lurking,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment
strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 By 0920 GMT, the euro  was little changed on the day
at $1.2300, pulling back from the day's high of $1.2334 hit in
early European trade.
 The single currency looks set to end the month of May around
7.5 percent lower against the dollar as ongoing debt problems in
euro zone countries have rocked confidence in the euro system.
 A French government minister also said on Sunday keeping its
top-notch credit rating would be ""a stretch"" without some tough
budget decisions.
 June Bund futures  were trading at 128.62, up 12
ticks from Friday's settlement close. About 60,000 lots changed
hands so far compared with a daily average of around one million
lots seen this month.
 German government bonds have been one of the main
beneficiaries of investors seeking harbour from the euro zone
debt crisis. The 10-year Spanish/German spread
 widened about 3 basis points to 160 bps.
 With market holidays in London and New York, investors
needed few excuses to trade with caution but China provided
another one.
 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao warned that global economic
growth remained vulnerable to sovereign debt risks and the
possibility of a second downturn, but said his own nation's
growth remained on track. [ID:nTOE64U03S]

down nearly 10 percent this month, heading for its worst monthly
loss since February 2009.
 European shares <.FTEU3> were up 0.2 percent with trading

574,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2010 05:19AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Euro zone lending to firms falls in April-ECB," * Business borrowing at lowest in nearly two years
 * Household borrowing rises to new record high
 * Analysts said back outlook for low growth, inflation
 
 FRANKFURT, May 31 (Reuters) - Lending to euro zone firms
fell again in April to its lowest level in almost two years and
although loans to households increased to a new record high,
economists warned against over-optimism. 
 European Central Bank figures on Monday showed corporate
borrowing fell 14 billion month-on-month in April to its lowest
level since June 2008, 2.6 percent weaker over the year.
 But this was offset by a 17 billion euro increase in
household borrowing, taking overall lending to a new record high
and posting the sixth annual increase in a row, of 2.5 percent.
 This helped loans to the private sector overall to a 0.1
percent increase over the year, compared to a drop of 0.2
percent in March, but economists said it did not change the
outlook for a bumpy economic recovery.
 ""The ECB will likely stick to its assessment that we have
seen a trough in momentum but recovery will be slow,""
Commerzbank economist Michael Schubert said.
 Global Insight economist Howard Archer said the data
confirmed the ECB would likely keep rates at current record low
levels well into 2011.
 ""Even allowing for muted demand for businesses for bank
credit, the lending data maintain concern that Eurozone recovery
could be held back over the coming months by a significant
number of companies being unable to get the credit that they
need,"" he said. 
 M3 money supply, a measure of cash readily available to
spend which the ECB sees as a leading indicator for inflation,
fell 0.1 percent on an annual basis, against expectations of a
0.2 percent fall.
 At -0.2 percent, the three-month moving average of M3 growth
remains well below the ECB's reference rate of 4.5 percent,
above which the bank sees dangers to medium-term price
stability.

 By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Abhijit Neogy
 NEW DELHI, May 31 (Reuters) - India's economy grew at its
fastest in six months in the quarter through March thanks to
government and consumer spending, which was roughly in line with
expectations and likely to keep the central bank on its path of
gradual monetary tightening.
 While worries over Europe's debt crisis had dampened
expectation that the Reserve Bank of India would raise interest
rates before its next scheduled policy review on July 27, when
most analysts expect another rate rise, Monday's report adds to
the case for tightening, an HSBC economist wrote.
 ""Investment and manufacturing have powered the expansion so
far, with consumption and services still lagging the advance.
The details suggest that growth could be stronger still in the
coming quarters, lending yet more urgency to rate hikes by the
RBI,"" wrote Frederic Neumann, regional economist at HSBC in Hong
Kong.
 The rupee  trimmed losses after the data but gave up
those gains in line with the choppy stock market <.BSESN>.
 The 5-year swap rate  and the benchmark bond
yield  rose as much as 7 basis points each from
before the release as the data reaffirmed expectations that the
RBI's tightening would be at a gradual pace.
 Dealers said hopes that the eurozone crisis may slow the
process of rate hikes had abated Monday's data release.
 Meanwhile, the monsoon rains that are vital for farm output
in India hit the country's southern coast as forecast, the
weather office said on Monday, welcome economic news after last
summer's drought, which drove up food prices.
 ""This release is a backward-looking number and our sense is
that policymakers would remain considerate of the external
developments and any associated downside risk to overall
growth,"" said Anubhuti Sahay, a Standard Chartered economist in
Mumbai.
 Sahay expects the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to raise rates
by 25 bps in the July policy review. The RBI has already lifted
rates twice by a total of 50 basis points since mid-March.
 Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya lowered his expectation
for an increase in the key repo policy rate in the second half
of 2010 to 50 basis points from an earlier 75 basis points,
citing debt concerns in Europe and a slowdown in inflows. He
maintained his outlook for a further 100 basis points of
tightening in 2011.
 RBI Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said the central bank would
""steadily"" normalise its policy rates, in an interview to the
Indian Express newspaper that was published on Monday.
 
 GROWTH DRIVERS
 The 8.6 percent expansion in the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year 2009/10 was broadly in line with a median forecast
of 8.7 percent in a Reuters poll and lifted the annual growth
rate for the full fiscal year to a slightly better-than-expected
7.4 percent.
 India's economy grew 6.7 percent in 2008/09, and the
Jan-March 2009/10 growth rate matches the revised data for the
second quarter of 2009/10.
<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
Manufacturing output grew 16.3 percent year-on-year in the
quarter as consumers bought more cars and other goods, while
farm output grew an annual 0.7 percent, thanks to a good winter
harvest.
 The government expects the economy to grow 8.5 percent in
the current fiscal year that started on April 1 on the prospects
of a better farm output and a global recovery. Finance Minister
Pranab Mukherjee on Monday said growth would exceed that
estimate. [ID:nBMA007666]
 
 INFLATION WORRIES
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week said an annual
economic growth rate of 10 percent is needed in the medium term
to address poverty and malnutrition, which continue to plague
the world's second-most populous country.
 But even as Singh aims for high economic growth, inflation
has come to haunt his government and appears to be undermining
its support base.
 Wholesale prices, the most closely watched inflation gauge
in India, rose 9.59 percent in April from a year earlier,
although government officials have said that headline inflation
had peaked.
 The wholesale price inflation vaulted above the RBI's
end-March 2010 inflation forecast of 8.5 percent, made in
January, and crossed the 10 percent mark in February.
 Rising cost pressures are also dragging down the pace of
manufacturing growth, as a second-straight monthly decline in
the HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers' Index  in April
showed. [ID:nBMA007452]
 The rapid acceleration in the world's second-fastest growing
major economy after China is boosting consumer demand ahead of
what can be met by existing supply capacity.
 Analysts expect monetary policy tightening along the year,
as the RBI moves to cool demand through rate hikes until firms
crank up their capacity. A Reuters poll last month showed median
expectations for a cumulative 100 basis points worth of
tightening in key interest rates by the end of March 2011.

 MADRID, May 31 (Reuters) - Debt-laden Spanish builder Sacyr
said it was close to reaching a deal with banks to refinance
its core real estate unit's debt, cheering investors and sending
its shares up as much as 5 percent in opening trade.
 Sacyr said on Monday it had reached a provisional agreement
on the main aspects of a debt consolidation plan for its real
estate business, Vallehermoso.
 Shares in the company were up 5.6 percent at 0830 GMT,
bucking the trend of the wider IBEX-30, down 0.7 percent after
media reported the company would be exempt from paying its
principal 1.64 billion euros debt and interest until 2015.
 Earlier this month, Sacyr promised to cut its 12 billion
euro ($14.70 billion) debt pile as it announced positive
first-quarter results, with a strong diversification in
international orders compensating for its exposure to Spain's
battered construction industry.
 The company has been grappling with high debts since its
acquisition of a 20 percent stake in oil major Repsol at the
height of the property boom and missed its 11.5 billion euros
debt reduction target for 2009.
 Aside from deferring its principal maturities, Vallehermoso
unit would also recive receive 320 million euros of credit
lines to allow it to complete pending projects, media reported.
 ""This deal is a material milestone for the group, helping to
materialize the value of its residential portfolio,"" BPI
analysts said.
 The credit line is of ""capital importance"" to develop
Vallehermoso's portfolio, BPI said, giving the unit an
enterprise value of 2.7 billion euros.

 * But analysts say euro vulnerable to more losses
 * Currencies little changed in holiday-thinned market

(Adds comment, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro inched up on Monday,
recovering slight losses suffered after a cut to Spain's
sovereign debt rating, but the currency remained on the back
foot as the downgrade highlighted weakness in some euro zone
countries already suffering from debt problems.
 China's warning that the global economy remained vulnerable
to sovereign debt risks capped demand for higher-risk
currencies, while investors were wary of taking on big positions
given market holidays in London and the United States.
 Spain's downgrade by Fitch ratings agency on Friday followed
a similar move by S&P last month, and analysts said the reaction
from currency markets had been limited as the move had been
widely expected.
 But many say the euro is poised for more losses after its
dramatic tumble this month given that structural problems remain
in some euro zone countries, while uncertainties about the scope
of the debt crisis in the region will keep investors jittery.
 ""I wouldn't draw the conclusion that because the markets
didn't react to the downgrade that the pressure isn't to the
downside on the euro,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""We don't have a solution for the debt crisis right now. The
pressure on the euro will remain.""
 By 0748 GMT, the euro was little changed on the day at
$1.2290, pulling back from the day's high $1.2334 hit in early,
holiday-thinned European trade. Against a broadly weaker yen, it
rose 0.6 percent to 112.40 yen.
 The euro regained its composure after slipping to $1.2263 on
Friday, when Fitch announced its downgrade.
 But the single currency is on track to end the month of May
around 7.5 percent lower against the dollar as ongoing debt
problems in euro zone countries including Greece has rocked
confidence in the euro system.
 This has made investors averse to risk, prompting many to
flee to the safe-haven dollar. On Monday, the U.S. currency
rose 0.2 percent versus a currency basket to 86.617, while it
rose 0.4 percent to 91.39 yen.
 
 CHINA WARNING
 Sterling edged up 0.2 percent to $1.4490 as traders covered
short positions in the currency, which slipped earlier in the
day after a UK treasury minister resigned on Saturday following
revelations about his expenses.
Underlining ongoing economic risks, China's Wen warned on
Monday that global growth remained vulnerable to sovereign debt
risks and the possibility of a second downturn.
 Traders said Wen's comments prompted market players to be
cautious of China's stance on euro zone bond holdings, even
after China's central bank said last week that Europe remains a
key investment market for China's foreign exchange reserves.
 Underscoring worries about regional debt pressures, France
admitted on Sunday that keeping its top-notch credit rating
would be ""a stretch"" without some tough budget decisions,
following German hints that Berlin may raise taxes to help bring
down its deficit.
 Investors await a U.S. employment report for May due on
Friday to see if it can help market sentiment as concerns about
Europe's fiscal problems continue, traders said.

 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the
dollar on Monday, recovering some of its losses made following a
downgrade in Spain's credit rating, while the yen fell broadly as
save-haven buying of it faded in holiday-thinned trade.
 Euro's gains were capped after remarks by China's Premier Wen
Jiabao that international sovereign debt risks may not be over,
but market players avoided building positions up as the United
States and Britain are on holiday on Monday.
 ""The mood in the market is calm and stable, but that is
because few players are in the market today,"" said a senior
options trader at a Japanese bank.
 ""We're very likely to see another volatile month ahead since
the debt problems seem to be spreading into the bigger economies
in the euro zone,"" the trader said.
 The euro is on track for a fall of more than 7 percent
against the dollar in May, in what would be its sixth straight
monthly fall and the biggest percentage drop since January 2009.
 Traders say euro support lies at this month's four-year low
of $1.2143 and then around $1.2135, a 50 percent retracement of
its 2000-08 advance.
 It stood at $1.2315 on Monday, up 0.3 percent on the day but
off an earlier high of $1.2332 hit on trading platform EBS.
 China's Wen warned on Monday that global economic growth
remained vulnerable to sovereign debt risks and the possibility
of a second downturn.
 Traders said Wen's comments prompted market players to be
cautious of China's stance on euro-zone bond holdings, even after
China's central bank said last week that Europe remains a key
investment market for China's foreign exchange reserves.
 The euro fell on Friday after Fitch cut Spain's credit rating
by one notch to AA-plus, saying its economic recovery will be
""more muted"" than the government forecast due to its austerity
measures.
 Underscoring worries about regional debt pressures, France
admitted on Sunday that keeping its top-notch credit rating would
be ""a stretch"" without some tough budget decisions, following
German hints that Berlin may raise taxes to help bring down its
deficit.
 Attention is shifting to the U.S. employment report for May
due on Friday to see if it can help market sentiment as concerns
about Europe's fiscal problems continue, traders said.
 ""The market is waiting for the jobs data to see if the U.S.,
whose economic figures are relatively firm, can provide support
for the global economy,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, head of forex and
money trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking in Singapore.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 91.52 yen.
 Some month-end dollar demand emerged against the yen but
Japanese exporters were expected to sell into moves up to 91.50
yen, traders said.
 The euro rose 0.8 percent to 112.78 yen, having fallen 0.7
percent on Friday.
 Another focus of the market this week is the meeting of
finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20
wealthy and developing economies in South Korea.
 The meeting is expected to grapple with Europe's debt crisis,
financial reforms and efforts to rebalance the global economy.
 The Australian dollar was steady at $0.8476 ahead of the
Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision on Tuesday, with
expectations the central bank will keep its key rate on hold at
4.50 percent.
 Market players said the yen may weaken further after media
polls showed support for Japan's government continued to fall
before a looming election for parliament's upper house, as calls
emerge within the ruling party for struggling Prime Minister
Yukio Hatoyama to quit over broken campaign promises.
 In the latest blow to Hatoyama, the tiny Social Democratic
Party left the ruling coalition on Sunday after the premier
abandoned his pledge to move a U.S. Marine airbase off Okinawa
island in southern Japan.
 But other traders say the impact of Japan's political
instability on the yen will be secondary to safety buying as soon
as the market turns nervous about the European debt woes.
 Sterling lost 0.1 percent to $1.4449 after after a British
treasury minister, an architect of plans to rein in the budget
deficit, resigned on Saturday following revelations about his
expenses.

 * No mention of yuan; full revival in China trade needs time
 * Achieving China inflation target an important goal
(Writes through)
 By Chris Buckley
 TOKYO, May 31 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao warned
on Monday that global economic growth remained vulnerable to
sovereign debt risks and the possibility of a second downturn,
but said his own nation's growth remained on track.
 Wen told an audience of Japanese business executives that it
was too early for economies to consider exiting stimulus spending
that has shored up growth since the global financial crisis hit
in 2008.
 But he also warned that mounting government debt risks could
frustrate full economic recovery.
 ""Some people say the global economy has already recovered,
and now we can consider exit mechanisms. I believe that this
judgement is premature,"" Wen said in the speech, given on the
second day of a three-day visit to Japan.
 High joblessness in the United States and other economies,
and sovereign debt risks laid bare by Greece's crisis could all
drag down the global recovery and trigger a second dip in growth,
Wen said.
 ""Some countries have experienced sovereign debt crises, for
example Greece. Is this kind of phenomenon over? Now it seems
that it's not so simple and we must take a full measure of the
difficulties,"" he said.
 ""Some people ask is there the possibility of a double dip in
the world economy? I believe that we can't say with absolute
certainty, and so we must undertake close observation and act to
prevent a double dip,"" he said later.
 ""The world economy is stable and beginning to revive, but
this revival is slow and there are many uncertainties and
destabilising factors.""
 Wen gave his blunt overview of the Chinese and world economy
in a speech that he said was not from a written script. No script
could be seen on the podium.
 NO MENTION OF YUAN
 But the Chinese leader stayed away from mentioning the yuan
exchange rate, which many politicians and economists in the
United States and elsewhere say is held artificially low and is
exacerbating the global economic imbalances that Wen described.
 Wen's cautious assessment of China's trade outlook suggested
that he could see dangers in quickly moving to lift the value of
the yuan, which would make the country's exports relatively more
costly.
 China's exports appeared to have bounced back in the first
quarter, but that was compared to a low base last year, said Wen.
China recorded a $1.7 billion trade surplus last month, defying
expectations of a second straight deficit after March's $7.2
billion shortfall.
 ""For (Chinese) external trade to revive to pre-financial
crisis levels needs time and is a difficult process,"" he said.
 Those uncertainties make it all the more important for China
and other economies to refrain from exiting stimulus spending
policies launched to counter the financial crisis, said Wen.
 ""In these circumstances, all countries must coordinate in
unity and strengthen policy support for the economy. There cannot
be the least relaxation,"" he said.
 ""To ensure that the (Chinese) economy continues growing in a
steady, relatively fast pace, we must maintain a certain level of
intensity in economic stimulus"", he said.
 China's economic growth reached 11.9 percent year-on-year in
the first quarter.
 While China ploughs ahead with expansionary fiscal policies,
however, it will also keep a close eye on inflationary pressures
that have risen in recent months, Wen said.
 China's consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8 percent in April
from a year earlier, nudging close to the target of keeping it
within about 3 percent across the year, he noted.
 ""Achieving this task is an important goal for this year,"" he
said.

percent on Friday.

 HONG KONG, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro steadied on Monday
but remained under pressure after Fitch downgraded Spain's
credit rating and France said keeping its top credit rating may
be a stretch without tough budget cuts.
 The European single currency is on track for a hefty 7.7
percent drop against the dollar in May on worries that Greece's
debt crisis will spread to other countries in the euro zone,
potentially derailing the global economic recovery.
 May's decline would be the euro's sixth straight monthly
fall and its biggest percentage drop since January 2009.
 European shares were expected to open slightly higher,
tracking modest gains in Asia, but trade was likely to be thin
with U.S. and UK markets closed for holidays.
 Asian stocks outside of Japan rose 0.3 percent but looked
set to post their worst month since October 2008 as Europe's
sovereign debt woes prompted investors to dump riskier assets
such as equities and commodities.
 ""The market is susceptible to negative news and small
rallies in the euro on short-covering don't last for long,""
said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 ""This jitteriness in the market is likely to continue for a

sentiment as there are worries that further bad news about
southern European countries may come out,"" he said.
 EURO STEADIES
 The euro was steady at $1.2282 staying above a four-year
low of $1.2143 hit this month.
 The currency fell 0.8 percent on Friday after Fitch cut
Spain's credit rating by one notch to AA-plus, saying the
country's economic recovery will be ""more muted"" than the
government forecast due to its austerity measures.
 Underscoring worries about regional debt pressures, France
admitted on Sunday that keeping its top-notch credit rating
would be ""a stretch"" without some tough budget decisions,
following German hints that Berlin may resort to raising taxes
to help bring down its deficit.
 The euro was also capped on Monday by remarks from China's
Premier Wen Jiabao, who said global growth remained vulnerable
to sovereign debt risks and the possibility of a second
downturn.
 The euro rose 0.8 percent against the yen to 112.69 yen
while the dollar rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 91.50 yen
a 10-day high.
 Traders are awaiting manufacturing surveys from Europe,
Britain, China and the United States on Tuesday which may
provide the first detailed look at whether May's market mayhem
inflicted any serious damage on the global recovery.
 Market attention is also shifting to the U.S. employment
report for May due on Friday to see whether it can help revive
market confidence, even as concerns about Europe's fiscal
problems continue.
 ""The market is waiting for the jobs data to see if the
U.S., whose economic figures are relatively firm, could provide
support for the global economy,"" said Satoshi Okagawa, head of
forex and money trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking in
Singapore.
 WORST MONTH SINCE LEHMAN
 Despite modest gains for the day, the MSCI index of Asia
Pacific stocks outside Japan was on track for a loss of more
than 11 percent for May, its worst month since the aftermath of
the Lehman Brothers collapse. The index has lost close to 9
percent so far this year.
 Japan's Nikkei ended up 0.1 percent as the yen sagged to a
10-day low against the dollar, boosting shares of Japanese
exporters. The Nikkei lost 11.7 percent on the month.
 According to Nomura, the last two weeks of May saw net
outflows of US$24 billion from global equity mutual funds as
market volatity grew, which in absolute terms, negated inflows
from the past 15 weeks.
 U.S. crude oil futures rose 45 cents to $74.44 a barrel.
 Front-month crude fell $12.18, or 14.1 percent, in May, the
biggest monthly percentage loss since December 2008, on worries
that a setback in the global recovery would dampen energy
demand.

 NUSA DUA, Indonesia, May 31 (Reuters) - Indonesia, the
world's largest thermal coal exporter, is evaluating whether it
still needs to introduce letters of credit for coal exports,
Mahendra Siregar, vice trade minister, said on Monday.
 ""The plan was to improve the import and export environment,
the conditions at the time needed an increase of foreign
exchange flow. But now things have started to change,"" he said
at the Coaltrans conference in Bali.
 The government issued the regulation in April 2009 as part
of moves to reduce capital outflows. It was intended to support
the rupiah currency by ensuring that revenue from exports of
commodities including palm oil, rubber, cocoa, coffee and
mining products are kept onshore.
 The ministry postponed the implementation of the regulation
on Sept. 1, then delayed it again to Nov. 1.
 Exporters have strongly opposed the regulation because they
fear that the mandatory use of letters of credit could scare
away buyers who prefer other payment methods.
 Indonesia is also the world's top producer of palm oil and
number two producer of rubber and robust coffee, which is used
for instant coffee.

Reserve and the European Central Bank on Monday both singled
out emerging economies as key to global financial stability.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the world
economy depends ever more on emerging markets to maintain
strong domestic growth and economic and financial stability.
 ""Improvements in emerging market policies and policy
frameworks ... have ramifications beyond the emerging market
economies themselves,"" he said in videotaped remarks prepared
for delivery to a conference sponsored by the Bank of Korea.
 Bernanke did not discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy
or interest rates.
 His remarks were echoed by European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet who said in separate videotaped comments to
the conference that emerging economies have been a source of
strength in the global financial crisis.
 ""One distinctive aspect of this crisis has been its
originating in industrial economies. Emerging countries have
also been severely affected, but as a group remained a source
of strength for the world economy,"" Trichet said in the
prepared comments.
 Commenting on South Korea, Bernanke said actions taken by
its government and central bank since the Asian financial
crisis of the late 1990s helped it weather the crisis that
swept economies around the world in 2007-2009.
 South Korea had amassed a budget and trade surplus and
pushed banks to prepare for shocks, Bernanke said. In addition,
its central bank's move to focus on domestic price stability
rather than on stabilising exchange rates also helped the
country during the turmoil.
 As a result of a formal inflation-targeting regime adopted
by South Korea's central bank in 1998, it could lower rates
during the crisis without scaring investors off, Bernanke said.
 ""In earlier crises, foreign investors were not inclined to
give emerging market policy makers the benefit of the doubt
when they promised low inflation and sustainable fiscal
policies,"" he said.

 * Market holiday in U.S. and UK keep investors low key
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 31 (Reuters) - The euro stabilized against the
dollar on Monday but remained under downward pressure after Fitch
Ratings downgraded Spain's credit rating, refuelling concern
about Europe's debt woes hurting the global economy.
 Investors may avoid building positions up as the United
States and the UK are on holiday on Monday, though some month-end
flows may be seen in the market, traders said.
 The European single currency is on track for a hefty 7.7
percent decline against the dollar in May, in what would be its
sixth straight monthly fall and the biggest percentage drop since
January 2009.
 ""The market is susceptible to negative news and small rallies
in the euro on short-covering don't last for long,"" said a trader
at a Japanese bank.
 ""This jitteriness in the market is likely to continue for a
while, and it is difficult to see a recovery in market sentiment

 Fitch cut Spain's credit rating by one notch to AA-plus on
Friday, saying the country's economic recovery will be ""more
muted"" than the government forecast due to its austerity
measures. The outlook on the new rating is stable.
 The euro was steady at $1.2282, staying above a four-year low
of $1.2143 hit this month.
 ""The next 24-hours might put the recent euro low in play at
$1.2143,"" said a trader at a major Canadian bank.
A key support is seen around $1.2135, a 50 percent retracement
of the 2000-08 advance.
 Charts indicate a monthly close below $1.2135 would favour
additional weakness with the next downside support seen near
$1.1640 -- a trough hit in November 2005.
 The euro was little changed at 111.88 yen, having fallen 0.7
percent on Friday.
 The dollar was steady at 91.05 yen. Japanese exporters are
expected to sell the greenback when it nears 91.50 yen, traders
said.
 Month-end flows may have some impact on dollar/yen towards
the Tokyo fixing time (0100 GMT) but the currency pair is
basically seen staying around 91 yen, they said.
 Market players are keeping an eye on Japan's political
turmoil after Japan's tiny Social Democratic Party on Sunday left
the ruling coalition ahead of an election, although its impact on
the currency market so far is seen as limited.

of U.S. jobs, a Democratic senator said on Sunday he will push
legislation to make companies inform customers when their calls
were being transferred outside the United States and charge
companies for those transferred calls.
 ""This bill will not only serve to maintain call center jobs
currently in the United States, but also provide a reason for
companies that have already outsourced jobs to bring them
back,"" Senator Charles Schumer said in statement.
 Customers calling 800 numbers are often transferred
overseas, and in such cases the bill would mandate that callers
be told where their calls were rerouted.
 Companies would also be required to certify to the Federal
Trade Commission annually that they were complying with the
requirement, and face penalties if they did not certify.
 Schumer's bill would also impose a $0.25 excise tax on any
customer service call placed inside the United States which is
transferred to an agent in a foreign location. The fee would be
assessed on the company that transferred the call.
 Customer service call centers have become increasingly
popular with businesses in recent years to deal with questions
ranging from billing to technical support.
 But the practice brings frequent complaints from customers
who say their issues are not resolved or that representatives
are merely providing scripted responses.
 Schumer said the most popular countries for outsourcing of
U.S. call centers included India, Indonesia, Ireland, the
Philippines and South Africa, places where workers generally
receive lower wages and work longer hours than their U.S.
counterparts.

 * Crown to recoup pre-vote losses
 * Still some risk of bickering among centre-right parties
 * For other election stories, click on
 
 By Jason Hovet
 PRAGUE, May 30 (Reuters) - Czech markets looked set for a
post-election rally starting on Monday after a decisive victory
for centre-right parties seen as having the best shot at forming
an austerity-minded government.
 The outcome was the one markets had most hoped for and
almost eliminates fears of a stalemate that could have led to
drawn-out coalition talks and delay plans on next year's budget.
 The crown fell 0.8 percent when the polls opened on Friday
due to fear over the vote in a country that has not had a stable
cabinet this decade, causing it to lag neighbours in reform.
 With the strong centre-right victory, RBC Capital Markets
strategist Nigel Rendell said the crown could quickly recoup
those losses on Monday and double its gains throughout the week.
 ""Over the course of the week it could be one of the
best-performing currencies in emerging markets without a shadow
of a doubt,"" he said. 
 ""I would imagine most people will want to buy as soon as
they get to their desks Monday morning.""
The three centre-right parties, which led by the Civic
Democrats won 118 seats out of 200, have promised fiscal
austerity measures to avoid falling into what the say is a
Greek-style debt trap.
 Civic Democrat leader Petr Necas said on Sunday he aimed to
cut the 2011 budget deficit to 4.0 to 4.5 percent next year from
this year's 5.3 percent, more than the outgoing government's
plan of 4.8 percent.
 Analysts say cuts are needed but could prove to be a drag on
domestic demand in the country of 10.5 million.
 ""These elections suggest decisive action on the budget and
pension reform. They should significantly ease market concern
over any vulnerabilities,"" said RBS strategist Timothy Ash.
 ""That said, the Czech economy has been badly impacted by the
global crisis ... The prospect of fiscal austerity will further
slow the recovery.""
 This, he said, may lead to lower interest rates even after a
surprise cut to an all-time low of 0.75 percent on May 6.
Interest rate swaps dropped around 40 basis points since then
and only started to rise again last week. 
 The crown is often seen as safer haven than the more
volatile Hungarian forint or Polish zloty and it has led gainers
in the region with a 1.8 percent rise so far this year
 But it is 3.8 percent off an April 15 high this year of
25.015 against the euro as Europe's debt crisis sours investor
appetite. The Prague stock market lost 11 percent this month.
 Analysts said shares in 69.8 percent state-owned CEZ may
drop as some investors had expected a higher dividend payment
because of left campaign pledges to use the power group's record
profits to fund a bonus pension payment.
 The centre-right's tight fiscal pledges, though, can support
long-end bond yields. But the outlook was still for higher
yields in the last half of the year when the country must raise
about 70 percent of its gross borrowing needs, analysts said.
The yield on the benchmark 2019 bond has risen 40 basis
points since mid-April, widening the spread over benchmark
German bonds to 150 basis points.
 Two new political parties, TOP09 and Public Affairs, would
be in the coalition now in the works and a risk remains fighting
between the parties could paralyse policy.
 RBC's Rendel said that as long as they come up with credible
budget cuts, markets will be happy.
 ""Hopefully they'll consider the greater good of the country
and put fiscal differences to one side and concentrate on
sorting out the economics and the budget,"" he said.
 ""That's what markets will hope for.""

 * AAA rating important for the future

(Adds details)
 PARIS, May 30 (Reuters) - France's Budget Minister Francois
Baroin said on Sunday the objective of keeping the country's AAA
rating was ""a stretch"" and had an impact on economic policy
decisions related to cutting the deficit.
 In an interview on Canal+ TV, Baroin was asked whether
France's plans to tackle its ballooning deficit had been
announced in order to keep its AAA credit rating, which is the
highest rating issued by ratings agencies.
 He replied: ""The objective of keeping the AAA rating is an
objective that is a stretch, and it is an objective that, in
fact, partly informs the economic policies we want to have.""
 Contacted by Reuters, the Budget Ministry later clarified
that the target was ""a demanding (objective) which we're
committed to.""
 Talks are taking place on pension reform -- a key part of
the plan to cut the deficit -- and France has frozen central
government spending barring pensions and interest payments
between 2011 and 2013.
 France is also considering introducing a constitutional
amendment that would set binding budget deficit limits.
 Baroin added: ""We must maintain our AAA rating, reduce our
debt to avoid being too dependent on the markets, and we must do
this for the long-term."" 
 Fitch Ratings said on Friday the recently stepped-up
dialogue in France was an important first step in addressing
France's fiscal deficit.
 France has forecast its deficit will come in at 8 percent of
GDP this year, and aims to bring it down to within the European
Union's 3 percent limit by 2013.

 * But will also face call for concessions
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 30 (Reuters) - World Trade Organization members
agree they must push on with difficult talks on a global trade
deal, but November's U.S. mid-term elections mean they are
unlikely to bear fruit before next year.
 The United States, ultimately the key to any pact, says that
what is on the table after 8 years of talks on the Doha round is
simply not compelling enough to attract support back home.
 Emerging economies say they have given enough in the current
draft of what is meant to be a deal promoting development, so
the scene is set for some bruising confrontations in which
Washington too will be under pressure to make concessions.
 ""We've walked up to the water's edge... What we haven't done
yet is dive into the actual give and take of negotiations,"" said
a senior U.S. official.
 The WTO's consensus-driven system requires negotiations to
move in a carefully choreographed dance, with proposals shared
among ever-widening groups to ensure that none of the 153
members feels excluded from decision-making.
 But the time has now come for ""frank, open and difficult
negotiations"" rather than exercises in transparency, U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk told a briefing.
 He was speaking after trade ministers met in Paris on May 27
to review the state of the Doha talks and agreed to pursue
negotiations in whatever form is needed to aim for a deal.
 In particular, Kirk wants China, India and Brazil -- as the
three prime beneficiaries of globalisation and the source of
much future growth in the world economy -- to make a bigger
contribution to a deal.
 Kirk insists it is not just the United States pushing the
big emerging economies. Other rich countries, and some
developing ones, also want a more ""ambitious"" deal, he said.
 U.S. negotiators also complain that talks so far have
concentrated on agriculture and manufactured goods, with little
progress in services such as insurance and express delivery.
 
 REDRESSING IMBALANCES
 China, India and Brazil retort that with hundreds of
millions of their citizens still living in poverty, they cannot
give all that it will take to clinch a deal in the Doha round --
launched in 2001 to right some of the imbalances in the global
trading system and help poor countries to prosper through trade.
 In practice that means that the United States, which says it
has already made generous offers on cutting trade-distorting
farm subsidies, must do more too.
 ""I think they now fully understand, and it's been made very
clear to them, that if they want to push for any additional
opening they need, then they're going to have to be responsive
in some of the areas where people want things from them,""
said one senior official familiar with the talks.
 It is now widely accepted that a deal will require the big
emerging economies to make additional offers, said this
official. The question is whether the administration of
President Barack Obama actually wants a deal before the mid-term
elections.
 ""It may be something they prefer to do next year rather than
this year,"" the official said.
 But that will deter America's trading partners from making
concessions now for fear they will face fresh demands in 2011.
 Even the strongest proponents of a Doha trade agreement now
acknowledge that the talks are at an impasse, despite statements
that a deal is the shot in the arm the global economy needs.
 Only 21 WTO members were represented at the Paris meeting,
and of those only nine at ministerial level -- far fewer than in
previous years where similar gatherings have taken place, and an
indication of the current low level of expectations.
 Proponents of a Doha deal argue that the boost it would
provide to business sentiment by opening new trading
opportunities in everything from corn to chemicals would
represent a welcome stimulus to the recovering world economy --
and one with little impact on stretched budgets.
 ""Despite the fact that there have been disagreements about
how much the value of the Doha Round on the table is worth,
there is no doubt that trade not only sustains and strengthens
economic growth, it also creates job opportunity,"" said
Australian Trade Minister Simon Crean.
 The problem is that trade also destroys jobs, and its
victims tend to be more vociferous than those whose firms are
benefiting from new export opportunities or consumers enjoying
cheaper goods from abroad.
 Trade is not just about exports. For many businesses in
today's sophisticated networked economy, the ability to source
intermediate goods and components through competitive imports
makes a crucial difference to their bottom line.
 But the fact remains that few votes are currently to be won
over trade in the United States, where labour unions and other
core constituencies of Obama's Democratic Party remain
suspicious of new trade deals.
 Trade is such a sensitive topic that Obama may prefer not to
argue for a new deal even next year, as he readies for a
re-election bid in 2012. ""Trade is a second-term issue,"" said
one WTO ambassador.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell across the board
on Friday after Fitch Ratings downgraded Spain's credit rating,
rekindling concerns about a sovereign debt crisis in the euro
zone.
 The euro was on track for a hefty 7.7 percent decline
against the U.S. dollar in May, in what would be the sixth
consecutive monthly fall and the biggest percentage drop since
January 2009.
 Fitch cut Spain's credit rating by one notch to AA-plus,
saying the country's economic recovery will be ""more muted""
than the government forecast due to its austerity measures. The
outlook on the new rating is stable. For details, see
[ID:nWNA2365]
 ""This should serve as a reminder that while the news stream
out of Europe was generally quiet this week, the potential and
risk is for more bad news to emerge from time to time and roil
markets,"" said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York.
 ""We are still negative on the euro. We think this is going
to be a multiyear bear trend for the euro,"" he added.
 In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2271 ,
down 0.8 percent, after dipping as low as $1.2265, according to
electronic trading platform EBS.
 Analysts said a key support level is $1.2135, the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the 2000-08 advance, just
above the recent four-year low of $1.2143. Charts further show
a monthly close below $1.2135 would favor more weakness, with
analysts seeing the next downside support at $1.1640, a low hit
in November 2005.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.9 percent at 111.56
, after hitting an intraday low of 111.35 on EBS.
 The dollar  slipped 0.2 percent to 90.89 yen, while
the dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback's
performance against a basket of currencies, was up 0.7 percent
at 86.751.
 The dollar and yen gained as U.S. stocks fell and data
showing U.S. consumer spending unexpectedly stalled in April
weighed on risk appetite. See wrap-up [ID:nN28167458].
 ""U.S. data today is not really that good for risk trades,""
said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at Wells
Fargo in New York. ""So we have seen equities lower.""
 800 POUND GORILLA
 Analysts said the downgrade of Spain was largely expected,
though the timing caught the market by surprise.
 ""We see multiple downgrades ahead for Spain,"" BBH's Thin
said. ""Indeed, Spain is the 800-pound gorilla in the room.
Greece and Portugal are small countries, but Spain is about
five times their size with regards to GDP.""
 Spain's head of Treasury said the country's sovereign debt
rating was still high despite the Fitch downgrade.
[ID:nMDT009070]
 A $1 trillion safety net set up by European officials
earlier this month to ward off the adverse effects from
Greece's debt problems and the announcements of new austerity
measures from Spain and Portugal have failed to brake the
euro's decline.
 Analysts said concerns about the euro zone's debt troubles
remain entrenched.
 Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy
at BNY Mellon in Boston, said there has been a lot of
short-term borrowing by European governments in the past two
years with an average maturity of less than two years.
 As a result, refinancing will be a big risk. ""That's going
to be a constant test as far as market sentiment is concerned,""
he said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell across the board
on Friday after Fitch Ratings downgraded Spain's credit ratings
on concern that austerity measures will dampen the country's
economic recovery.
 The euro was on track for a hefty 7.5 percent decline in
May, in what would be the sixth consecutive monthly fall and
the biggest percentage drop since January 2009.
 Fitch cut Spain's long-term foreign- and local-currency
issuer default ratings to AA-plus from AAA, saying the
country's economic recovery will be ""more muted"" than the
government forecast due to its austerity measures. The outlook
on the new ratings is stable.
 ""There are still some strong concerns about the euro,"" said
Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy at
BNY Mellon in Boston.
 ""In the grand scheme of things, this is pretty much
expected,"" Shankar said of the downgrade.
 The euro fell as low as $1.2284 after the Fitch downgrade,
according to electronic trading platform EBS, near a session
low. It recovered slightly to last trade down 0.5 percent at
$1.2301.
 Analysts said a key support level is $1.2135, the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the 2000-08 advance, just
above the recent four-year low of $1.2143. Charts further show
a monthly close below $1.2135 would favor more weakness, with
analysts seeing the next downside support at $1.1640, a low hit
in November 2005.
 Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago,
said the downgrade came on a day ""when the market is already
paper thin, so we may not see the full effect until we open
after the weekend.""
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.8 percent at 111.72
yen, after hitting an intraday low of 111.40 on EBS.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 90.84 yen, while the
dollar index, which measures the greenback's performance
against a basket of currencies, was up 0.5 percent at 86.592.
 Analysts said concerns about the euro zone's debt troubles
remain entrenched.
 Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities
in Toronto, cited a heavy debt auction schedule ahead in the
euro zone and some lumpy government bond redemptions over the
next few months, which could turn the market's focus to Italy.
 ""While Italy may not be aw structurally vulnerable as
Greece or Portugal, the relative underperformance of Italian
credit default swaps this month suggests that investor concerns
may be rotating away from Greece,"" Osborne said.

 * Move more euro buying than dollar selling
 * Data next week includes U.S. May non-farm payrolls
 NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - The dollar is expected to fall
against the euro in the coming week with investors betting that
most of the bad news on European fiscal woes is already priced
in with the single currency's 7 percent decline in May.
 Euro zone sovereign debt concerns remain in spite of a near
$1 trillion safety net set up by European officials to ward off
any contagion from Greece, but investors are willing to bet
that at least for now, the euro has touched solid support.
 This was so particularly after China's Central Bank this
week discounted a Financial Times report that Beijing was
concerned about its euro zone bond holdings.
 And though the monthly U.S. jobs report is scheduled for
Friday, investors are only likely to take their focus from
Europe if tensions on the Korean Peninsula explode into
conflict.
 ""It's probably dollar down a little bit with the fire put
out for now in Europe,"" said T.J. Marta, chief market
strategist at Marta on the Markets in Scotch Plains, New
Jersey. ""The euro could see a short covering rally but all bets
are off if there is more risk.""
 While Greece was the first country to exhibit signs of
fiscal stress, contagion has always been a fear and those
concerns came to the fore with the Spanish central bank's
takeover of a savings bank in the last week. [ID:nLDE64L007]
 The move highlighted the weakness of the banking sectors of
some euro zone members, already suffering from fiscal problems
and struggling to bring down their budget deficits. It also
marks sovereign debt risk spreading from the public to the
private sector.
 No new negative news would allow the euro to at least
consolidate.
 ""We get consolidation in the euro between 1.2100 and 1.2500
while waiting for more bad news from somewhere,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey. The euro last traded at $1.2347.
 For the week, the euro fell 1.6 percent  against the
dollar, while the dollar rose 0.7 percent against the yen
. For the month, the euro fell 7.2 percent against the
dollar, while the dollar fell 3.2 percent against the yen.
 KOREA
 The other risk factor at a global level is the mounting
antagonism between North and South Korea after the South,
backed by the United States, blamed its communist neighbor for
the March sinking of a South Korean naval ship.
 Any escalation from rhetoric to border skirmish would
rattle investors and prompt a flight into the relative safety
of the U.S. dollar. The yen would also gain, analysts said, not
on safe haven buying, given Japan's geographical proximity to
the two Koreas, but rather on investors selling euro against
yen.
 Coincidentally, finance ministers and central bankers from
the Group of 20 wealthy and developing economies gather in the
South Korean port city of Busan later next week to grapple with
Europe's debt crisis, financial reforms and efforts to
rebalance the global economy. The meeting will lay groundwork
for a summit of G20 leaders in Toronto later in June.
 The G20 needs ""to send some kind of signal about what they
plan to do to stabilize markets, because next week, we probably
start to focus on Italy and Spain,"" said Michael Malpede,
senior analyst at Easy Forex in Chicago.
 DATA GLUT
 A glut of U.S. data releases will also give investors much
to ponder with the schedule of reports getting heavier as the
week progresses. U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday
for the Memorial Day holiday.
 Tuesday's releases include a report on construction
spending in April, forecast to have fallen 0.1 percent and the
ISM manufacturing index for May, expected to post at 59.7.
 Wednesday's reports include Challenger layoffs data for May
and U.S. pending home sales for April with the latter seen
rising 3.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll.
 Thursday's data includes the ADP national employment
report, forecast to show an increase of 51,000 and the
government's weekly initial jobless claims.
 Later that day, April factory orders, expected to rise 1
percent, and the ISM services index for May, expected at 55.6,
will be released.
 The U.S. non-farm payrolls data will round out the week on
Friday. The government report is expected to show 425,000 new
jobs for the month, up from 290,000 new jobs created in April,
with the unemployment rate falling to 9.8 percent from 9.9
percent.
 ""Jobs is still an event risk but have to miss
(expectations) by 50,000 to get any type of move,"" said Marta.

 NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro drifted lower against
the dollar in a choppy session on Friday as
weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data tempered risk appetite,
weighing on stocks and triggering modest selling of the single
currency after early gains.
 U.S. data showing consumer spending was unexpectedly flat

euro after stocks fell. [ID:nN27266059].
 In recent weeks, the euro has become a proxy for risk
appetite in the currency market amid the euro zone's debt
crisis, rising and falling in tandem with global stocks.
 ""U.S. data today is not really that good for risk trades,""
said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at Wells
Fargo in New York. ""So we have seen equities lower and some
mild selling in the euro and also in the Aussie dollar, another

 In midday New York trading, the euro was down 0.1 percent
against the dollar at $1.2354  after rising to $1.2452.
 The euro started declining after the U.S. personal
consumption and spending report, with investors trying to make
a run at stops in the $1.2330 area. There was some German
buying interest in the euro early in the New York session, but
a trader said that could reverse if the single currency breaks
below $1.2330.
 A separate report showing business activity in the U.S.
Midwest grew more slowly than expected in May initially boosted
the euro, but the currency later fell as investors grew
cautious of risk trades. For the data, see [ID:nN28172391].
 Against the yen, the euro  fell 0.2 percent to
112.35.
 The dollar  slipped 0.2 percent to 90.89 yen, while
the dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback's
performance against a basket of currencies, was up at 86.341.
 Earlier in global trading, the euro was higher against the
dollar, boosted by month-end demand as investors square up
positions for May, a period that featured massive selling of
the single currency due to the debt crisis in the region.
 The euro fell about 12 cents against the dollar in the
month to hit a 4-year low of $1.2143. It was on track for a
hefty 7.1 percent monthly decline, which would be the biggest

 By Ben Berkowitz
 AMSTERDAM, May 28 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said it
would pay $4.7 billion cash to buy privately held East
Resources Inc, giving it more exposure to promising shale gas
reserves in North America.
 The deal would raise Shell's daily gas production in North
America by about 7.5 percent and give it access to a swathe of
the Marcellus Shale, the northeastern U.S. rock formation that
is a crucial source of future U.S. gas production.
 Shale gas accounts for between 15 percent and 20 percent of
U.S. gas production, but is expected to quadruple in coming
years, touching off a scramble among producers large and small
for access to resources.
 Analysts cautioned the deal would put pressure on Shell's
balance sheet at a time the company already is planning to
spend plenty of money on other projects.
 ""Although this is a good move, it will put further pressure
on the balance sheet, which is weakening with the high level of
organic capital expenditure the group has committed to,""
Panmure Gordon analyst Peter Hitchens said in a note.
 Hitchens said that weakened balance sheet would keep Shell
from increasing its dividend over the next two years.
 A Shell spokeswoman said the company was not commenting on
how it intended to finance the purchase. Shell had $8.45
billion cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at March 31
and generated nearly $4.8 billion in cash flow from operating
activities in the first quarter.
 Shell shares rose 0.41 percent to close at 1,822 pence on
the London Stock Exchange.
 PORTFOLIO UPGRADE
 Shell said growing and upgrading the quality of its North
American tight gas portfolio would be an ongoing strategy.
Tight gas refers to gas trapped in rock and sand formations.
 Shell is the latest in a line of international oil players
that have bought into the Marcellus, named for a town in New
York that sits near an outcropping of the rock formation. They
include Statoil, Exxon Mobil, Mitsui & Co and Reliance
Industries.
 The rush for acreage in U.S. shale, however, has met
persistent weakness in gas prices. Front month gas prices are
down more than 22 percent this year, though after a steady
decline they began to bottom out in late March.
 Shale gas is also harder and more expensive to extract
because it comes from rock rather than traditional reservoirs.
 Drilling could also become more expensive due to
environmental challenges. Environmentalists say the drilling
fluids that crack the rock and free the gas can contaminate
drinking water. The industry disputes this.
 East controls 650,000 net acres (2,600 square kilometers)
in the Marcellus Shale, and 1.05 million net acres overall.
 Depending on how they value the acreage outside of the
Marcellus, analysts pegged the price Shell is paying per acre
between $4,500 and $7,200. Companies have paid as much as
$14,000 an acre in recent months to buy into the Marcellus.
 Much of the acreage Shell is buying is located in two prime
counties for Marcellus drilling, Pritchard Capital partners
analyst Ray Deacon said.
 ""The quality of the assets in Tioga and Susquehanna
counties are probably the best in the Marcellus. That's just
based on how much production they're getting early in the life
of the wells -- that really improves the returns,"" Deacon
said.
 Besides its majority owners, East counts private equity
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co as an investor and Jefferies
& Co. as an adviser.
 The acquisition came hours after the U.S. government said
it would review Shell's plans to begin drilling exploratory
wells off Alaska this summer, delaying the project.
 The already controversial project has faced increased
scrutiny in recent weeks in the wake of the massive BP oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
 ""The news (on East) masks other bad news for Shell,""
Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers analyst Peter Heijen said in a
research note. ""That the delay falls right in the summer, just
as drilling can happen there, is extra bad.""

 TORONTO, May 28 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened
against the U.S. currency on Friday, after climbing to a
one-week high, as North American equities surrendered early
gains and investors squared off positions at the end of the
month, ahead of a U.S. holiday weekend.
 Stock markets fell on both sides of the border as risk
appetite was spoiled by U.S. data that showed consumer spending
was unexpectedly flat last month and growth in business
activity in the Midwest slowed. [.N]
 ""You're having a lot of people that are closing up equity

 There was no market-moving Canadian data to speak of ahead

which the market is pricing in a nearly 80 percent chance of a
25 basis point hike. 
 In a Reuters poll released Thursday, all of Canada's
primary securities dealers and most other global forecasters
predicted the Bank of Canada will start raising interest rates
next week as the economy roars ahead. [ID:nTOR007523]
 At 11:45 a.m. (1156 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was
at C$1.0505 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.19 U.S. cents, down a
touch from Thursday's North American close at C$1.0500 to the
U.S. dollar, or 95.24 U.S. cents.
 Earlier, the currency raced up to C$1.0444 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.75 U.S. cents, its highest level since May 20, as
oil topped $75 a barrel on broader-based U.S. dollar weakness,
while global stocks rose for a third straight session. [O/R]

 Gavsie said that, for the rest of the day, market observers
will be watching technical levels with support roughly around
C$1.0460 and resistance at C$1.0560 to the greenback.
 BONDS FIRMER
 Canadian bonds firmed along with U.S. Treasury notes, as
bargain hunting emerged after heavy losses the previous day and

 By Harry Papachristou
 ATHENS, May 28 (Reuters) - Greece will likely miss its
budget deficit target for this year as recession wreaks havoc on
construction firms and small businesses, leading to lower tax
receipts and higher social spending.
 Research firm Capital Economics expects the deficit to
shrink to about 9 percent of GDP from 13.6 percent in 2009,
short of an 8.1 percent target set out in Greece's bailout deal
with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.
 ""While Greece will make significant inroads into its
deficit, there remains a strong chance that it will miss its
2010 deficit target,"" said Capital Economics analyst Ben May.
 Greece this month received the biggest bailout in financial
history, with the IMF and the EU pledging 110 billion euros
($134.8 billion) in 2010-2013 to save the country from default.
 In return, the debt-laden nation promised to ram through
deficit cut measures of a total of 45 billion euros over the
same period to narrow its budget gap by an unprecedented 11
percentage points of GDP, to below an EU ceiling of 3 percent.
 But early budget figures suggest the planned deficit cut of
more than 20 billion euros in 2010 is too ambitious due to a
economic contraction seen at 4 percent of GDP, the country's
deepest recession since 1974.
""I think the Greek government's chances of implementing the
deficit target this year is 30 percent,"" said Diego Iscaro,
London-based analyst with IHS Global Insight. ""This reflects
risks both on the tax revenue and on the spending side.""
 Gross tax receipts between January and April rose 6 percent
year-on-year, far below an 11 percent target. The finance
ministry said on May 25 it had fired 20 heads of regional tax
offices for missing their collection targets.
 ""It's already whispered in finance ministry corridors that
the deficit won't fall below 9.5 percent this year"" said George
Romanias, an economist with Greece's main labour union GSEE.
 
 NOT A SOUL IN THE STORE
 Construction, a key growth engine over the past years
accounting for about 10 percent of GDP, has virtually screeched
to a halt after the government boosted property taxes in March.
 ""Building has dropped dead after the measures,"" Dimitris
Kapsimalis, head of Greece's home-builders' association, told
Reuters.
The government expects to raise about 2.5 billion euros this
year and next by its property tax increases and by sales of
pardons for past building code violations.
 But a virtual freeze in real estate deals that followed the
measures stands to cost Greece about 1.5 billion euros in lost
transaction tax revenues, says the Athens Real Estate Brokers'
Association.
 The building industry, which employed about 400,000 people
at its peak in 2005, is currently employing barely half that,
Kapsimalis said.
 Greek unemployment climbed to 12.1 percent in February, its
highest monthly level on record and above an average 2010
estimate of 11.8 percent foreseen in the bailout plan.
 Higher unemployment may force the government to spend more
on jobless benefits than previously expected. Unemployment
agency OAED is already selling bonds and shares in its portfolio
at firesale prices to pay out jobless benefits, Romanias said.
 State grants to OAE, the pension fund of the self-employed
OAEE, have already reached 65 percent of funds earmarked for the
full year, as small businesses close or delay contributions.
 About 60,000 smaller retailers, around a third of the total,
are expected to shut down by the end of the year, said Vassilis
Korkidis, chairman of Trade Association ESEE.
 Squeezed by a four-point VAT hike to 23 percent and an
estimated loss of households' purchasing power of about 10
percent as a result of public sector pay cuts, smaller retail
players are in danger of vanishing.
 ""Turnover is down 30 percent year-on-year,"" Korkidis told
Reuters. ""Many shops don't see a single customer for days"".
 Fuel tax increases, which have boosted the price of unleaded
gasoline by 36 percent to 1.52 euros a litre since February,
have shrunk sales volume by up to 15 percent, refinery sources
say, casting doubt on a target to generate about 1.5 billion
euros in additional revenues.
 
 NO HELP FROM TOURISM
 Tourism, Greece's biggest foreign currency earner, will not
be a big help this year either. Tourism receipts are set to
shrink for a second consecutive year, by up to 15 percent, as
strikes and violence sparked by austerity scares visitors away.
 About 30,000 room reservations were cancelled in Athens
alone after protesters set fire to a bank in May, killing three
people, according to the country's hotel association POX. ""They
say that any publicity is good publicity, but that's not the
case in tourism,"" said Athens hotelier Alexandros Vassilikos.
 Any deficit slippage could quell Greek hopes to return to
financial markets as early as next year, sooner than the EU/IMF
deal's assumption that this will happen in 2012.
 ""It's important for markets to see Greece meeting their
targets,"" said Iscaro at IHS Global Insight.
 ""If Greece comes out with a deficit of about 9.5 percent
in 2010, then concerns will rise that the only way out will be
debt restructuring. Obviously, it would then be much more
difficult to return to markets as early as 2011.""
 Still, analysts say the sheer size of the austerity measures
will reduce the deficit by a degree comfortable enough for the
IMF and the EU to continue funding Greece.
 ""As long as Greece comes close to meeting its 2010 target
and implements additional measures to ensure that it achieves
its 2011 goal, I doubt the EU and the IMF would withdraw their
support,"" May said.

 * ECB board member says euro zone troubles are a bellwether
 * Bini Smaghi criticises Germany for alarmist language
 * France to push ahead with pension reform
 
 By Jose Gonzalez
 MADRID, May 28 (Reuters) - Talks between Spanish unions and
business leaders on labour reform ended without success on
Friday, the latest sign that the euro zone is struggling to
steer its way out of a debt crisis and into growth.
 Spain is among the 'peripheral' countries whose debts have
stretched unity in the single currency zone to the limit as the
richer members, led by Germany, have been forced to set up a $1
trillion safety net.
 European Central Bank policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of
Italy accused Germany of exacerbating the crisis with alarmist
language, and said Europe's predicament was an early signal of
similar problems in other regions.
 ""We could say that euro area tensions are the 'canary in the
coal mine' of the challenges that policymakers worldwide are
going to face,"" he said in the text of a speech to be delivered
at a conference in Morocco.
 He said financial markets were testing countries' ability to
force through necessary fiscal corrections, and the problems
facing Greece and other financially strained euro zone members
were already spreading.
 ""Just look at the screens and you'll see the contagion under
way, spreading not only to peripheral countries but also to the
largest euro area countries and through the financial system.""
 Spain's public debt is modest by the standards of Greece,
Ireland or Italy.
 But economists say cutting the cost of hiring and firing is
vital if Spain is to regain competitiveness ando achieve
sustainable growth.
 On Friday, Madrid revised down its growth forecasts and said
unemployment would remain close to 20 percent.
 The difficulty of combining fiscal cuts with economic growth
was highlighted by HSBC group chairman Stephen Green, who said:
 ""We may yet see further shocks to some Western nations as
they come to terms with the reality of large national debts,
while conditions will remain challenging for households and
businesses alike, as long as jobs and growth remain elusive.""
 
 CLOCK TICKING
 With swingeing budget cuts already announced in Spain under
pressure from markets, the government must now try to broker
agreement in the next few days between labour unions and
business leaders who failed to reach a deal in bilateral talks.
 If there is no deal by May 31, the government will ram
through changes to labour laws anyway, said the parliamentary
spokesman for the governing Socialists, Jose Antonio Alonso.
 ""I am aware that things are not going too well and it is
possible that the government will have to reform the labour
market through a royal decree,"" he told Spanish radio.
 Unions are already set for a one-day strike over public
sector pay cuts for June 8, and said on Thursday that reform by
decree would prompt a general strike -- piling pressure on a
minority government already struggling to hang on to power.
 It seemed to narrowly avoid being brought down on Thursday
when parliament approved a vital 15 billion euro austerity
package by just one vote.
 However, Spanish unions had a limited turnout at their last
anti-austerity protest, like other protests elsewhere in Europe
that have failed to put governments under pressure, and Spanish
government bond prices showed little reaction.
 A Greek rally last week drew only half the crowd that turned
out for a riot-scarred protest on May 5. 
 France signalled on Friday it would go ahead with plans to
raise the retirement age after unions failed to rally enough
street power against the reform of a costly pension system.
 ""Whether one regrets or welcomes it, one must say the idea
of necessary sacrifice is advancing,"" wrote the French left-wing
daily Liberation.
 Austerity programmes and labour reforms are widely seen as
vital to underpin the emergency $1 trillion safety net.
 Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy have all agreed to push
through multi-billion euro savings despite fierce opposition.
 Germany, furious at having to dig deep to help profligate
nations despite the EU treaty's no-bailout clause, has insisted
the mechanism is only temporary and does not breach the treaty.
 It indicated on Friday that it would make permanent some of
the bans on short selling of securities --- uncoordinated with
euro zone partners that triggered falls in stocks and the euro
last week.
 
 ""ALARMIST""
 Bini Smaghi, one of the ECB's six-strong Executive Board,
accused Germany of making the situation worse as it tried to win
domestic support for aid to Greece.
 ""In one large euro area country it was thought that public
support for swift action could be achieved only by dramatising
the situation, for instance, by telling the public that
'the euro is in danger',"" he said referring to comments by
Chancellor Angela Merkel on May 19.
 ""But it was not realised that, in the midst of a financial
upheaval, such words are like fanning the flames and that the
cost of the support package could only increase following
such dramatic declarations,"" he said.
 World equities rose for the third day running and the euro
was stable against the dollar as investors refrained from
betting on further trouble in the euro zone ahead of a holiday
in major markets.
 But the euro has fallen around 7 percent against the dollar
this month and is set to register its sixth consecutive monthly
loss.

 NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher against
the dollar on Friday, boosted by month-end demand as investors
square up positions for May, a period which featured massive
selling of the single currency due to the ongoing debt crisis
in the region.
 The euro fell some 12 cents against the dollar in the month
to hit a 4-year low of $1.2143. It was on track for a hefty 6.9
percent monthly decline, which would be the biggest drop since
January 2009. It would also be the sixth straight monthly
fall.
 That was in spite of a $1 trillion safety net set up by
European officials earlier this month to ward off the adverse
effects from Greece's debt problems which threatened to spill
over into other euro zone countries, and the announcements of
new austerity measures from Spain and Portugal.
 ""The main feature is the covering of short euro positions
and this has lifted the single currency...against the dollar.
Its downside momentum has faded and the near-term risk is
position squaring,"" said Brown Brothers Harriman in a research
note.
 In early New York trading, the euro was slightly up against
the dollar at $1.2379 , after rising to $1.2452.
 U.S. data showing consumer spending was unexpectedly flat
in April, its weakest reading since September, initially
weighed on the euro after stocks traded flat. [ID:nN27266059].
 In recent weeks, the euro has become a proxy for risk
appetite in the currency market amid the euro zone's ongoing
debt crisis, rising and falling in tandem with global stocks.
 But the euro quickly recovered as month-end buying
resumed.
 Analysts said a key support level was $1.2135, the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the 2000-08 advance, just
above the recent four-year low of $1.2143.
 Charts show a monthly close below $1.2135 would favour more
weakness, with analysts seeing the next downside support at
$1.1640, a trough hit in November 2005.
 While market turmoil has calmed, concerns about the euro
zone remain entrenched.
 ""The financial package was a big step but it has its flaws.
The biggest issue is the turnaround by the European Central
Bank in buying government bonds,"" said Derek Halpenny, European
head of global currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ.
 Against the yen, the euro  was up at 112.81 yen.
 The dollar  was little changed at 91.15 yen, while
the dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback's
performance against a basket of currencies, was flat at 86.169.

626,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2010 09:31AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Fear and opportunity grip investors," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Investors are in a skittish mood,
bouncing between selling off risk at the first hint of trouble
and snapping up bargains when things are calm.
 Some are suggesting that the corrections of the past few
weeks may be hitting bottom, but few, if any, forsee anything
but volatility ahead.
 With this in mind the meeting of G20 finance ministers in
South Korea in the coming week is likely to be a key focus.
 It brings with it everything from macroeconomic appraisals
to talk of currency imbalances and even geopolitical tension
from neighbouring North Korea.
 The main question for investors, meanwhile, is whether the
roughly 17.5 percent fall in MSCI's all-country world stock
index between mid-April and last Tuesday was it for the
correction. The index has rebounded around 6 percent since then.
 Keith Springer, president of California-based wealth
advisers Capital Financial Advisory Services, think it might be.
 ""The selling action (during the week) looks like a selling
climax where people throw in the towel and run for the hills:,
he told Reuters. ""People were panicking.""
 There are other tell-tale signs that the sell-off, which has
infected other assets such as emerging market debt,
growth-linked commodities and high-yielding currencies, may be
limited.
 Reuters asset allocation polls, for example, showed large,
long-term investors stepping away from equities, but at less of
a rate that they have been.
 There is also no sign of the wholesale dash to cash by
investors that was seen when the subprime crisis threatened to
overturn the global banking system.
 Data from iMoneyNet showed a net $7.3 billion moved into
U.S. money market funds in the week to May 25. But this followed
a net $36.9 billion outflow the week before that.
 In all, a net $27 billion has come out of the cash funds
since around April 20, suggesting that despite stock market
volatility there remains a strong appetite for yield.
 
 PICKING UP BARGAINS
 One of the things this cash may be being used for is to pick
up bargains, which would be a logical move for investors who do
not believe that the world is on the brink of another
fundamental crisis.
 Springer, for example, reckons the mood around financial
markets provides an opportunity.
 ""Investor sentiment is overwhelmingly negative and getting
worse, which is great for stocks,"" he said.
 A similar view is held by Investec Asset Management, whose
emerging market debt team believe that what is happening
globally is positive economic and market trends being hit by not
untypical volatility after last year's very strong bull market
rally.
 ""We believe such a scenario provides good opportunities.
Knee-jerk reactions from market participants to events or
developments far removed from our investment universe have
typically created value opportunities,"" the team said in a note.
 ""For example, we took advantage of recent bond movements as
a result of European markets jitters to add to our long
positions in South African and Polish rates.""
 In the background, both views assume that fundamentals
remain positive -- improving U.S. and global growth, contained
euro debt problems, attractive corporate earnings -- and that
the sell-off is either not going to continue or will not get as
bad as the one that followed subprime.
 
 PARLEY IN BUSAN 
 Enter the G20. The finance ministers and central bankers
will meet in the South Korea city of Busan on June 3 to 5, with
the state of the global economy at the top of their agenda along
with Europe's debt problems.
 The main issue is a concern that the attempts by governments
to put their finances in order will act as a brake on the slowly
improving global economy.
 But there will also be discussion about regulation of banks
and financial markets following moves in the United States and
Germany.
 Both issues have been part of the market jitters of the past
few weeks.
 Currencies likely will come up on the sidelines as well,
with some discussions about reserve currencies given the euro's
recent fall and the dollar's domination.
 Some Asian countries, including Japan and China, are
concerned about the sharp rise of their currencies against the
tumbling euro.
 The week, as with the first week of every new month, will be
capped on Friday by the monthly U.S. jobs report.

 (Adds details, background) 
 By Bate Felix
 BRUSSELS, May 28 (Reuters) - The European Union faces
persistent barriers to free trade from some of its most
important partners, despite a gradual improvement in the global
economy, the EU executive said in a report released on Friday.
 The European Commission, which is responsible for EU trade
policy, also said in its annual trade report there were risks
that rising job losses around the world could fuel a new wave of
protectionist policies in the second half of 2010.
 ""There is a risk that trade restrictive measures introduced
by our partners during the crisis will become part of the trade
regime even when the economy picks up speed,"" EU Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht said in a statement.
 The annual report said almost 280 restrictive trade measures
had been put in place by the 27-country bloc's major G20 trading
partners in the past 18 months.
 It said few of the protectionist measures adopted by
countries at the height of the economic and financial crisis in
2008, to shield them from competition, had been removed as
promised by G20 states.
 About 1.7 percent of EU exports had been hit by others'
protectionist moves, compared to a World Trade Organisation
(WTO) estimate that such measures affect about 0.7 percent of
total G20 imports.
 Protectionist measures range from classic trade barriers,
such as import bans or tariff increases, to ""buy national"" and
other ""behind-the-border policies"", the Commission said.
 
 RUSSIA, ARGENTINA CRITICISED
 The Commission said EU exporters faced most restrictions in
Argentina and Russia, where a customs union with Belarus and
Kazakhstan was hurting the bloc's steel, automotive and
agri-food industries.
 ""The creation of the customs union of Russia, Kazakhstan and
Belarus, effective from January 2010, saw the consolidation of
most of Russia's duty increases introduced during the economic
crisis,"" it said.
 EU exporters face up to 69 trade restrictive measures in
Russia and 61 in Argentina, the majority of the measures
disproportionately hitting the textile, steel, automotive and
agricultural sectors, the report said.
 Russia which is seeking the EU's support in its bid to join
the WTO, has said it will keep the high trade tariffs on goods
such as cars and metals until it completes the accession
process.
 Russian and European Union leaders will meet on May 31 in
the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, to discuss several
issues including trade, climate change and the global financial
and economic crisis.
 The report covers restrictive trading measures in over 30 EU
trading partners including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
Ecuador, Nigeria, South Africa and the United States.
 It said exporters faced 18 and 19 trade restrictive measures
in the United States and China respectively, the EU's two top
trading partners.

 By Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, May 28 (Reuters) - Switzerland's economy is set to
grow more in coming months, the KOF barometer showed on Friday,
heightening the central bank's dilemma of how to respond to a
solid domestic recovery while fighting a rise in the currency.
 Also on Friday, data showed Swiss exports rose for the
second consecutive month in April as stronger global demand for
Swiss goods offset the potential dampening effect of the
strength of the franc, which has become a magnet for investors
seeking a safe haven.
 UniCredit economist Alexander Koch said the conundrum for
the Swiss National Bank was getting trickier after the KOF rose
to 2.16 in May, its strongest since Aug. 2006.
 ""(If) the pressure on the Swiss franc remains, and at the
same time the Swiss economy is fundamentally showing you should
raise rates, it's a tough question -- what do you do?,"" Koch
said.
 Switzerland weathered the global downturn better than other
European countries. With the euro pummelled by concerns about
sovereign debt in southern Europe, the franc strengthened nearly
3 percent against the euro between April 1 and May 19, when it
hit a record high just past 1.40 francs to the euro, despite
repeated SNB interventions to halt its rise.
 ""We consider 1.40 not to be dramatic, we would need a much
stronger franc to dampen exports,"" said Credit Suisse economist
Fabian Heller.
 Exports rose by 3.2 percent in April from a year earlier to
15.755 billion Swiss francs ($13.6 billion), the Federal Customs
Office said. That lifted Switzerland's merchandise trade surplus
to 2.022 billion francs, from 1.696 billion in March.
 SNB Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan said last week that Swiss
exporters had coped comparatively well so far with a stronger
currency, adding that global demand and not the exchange rate
were key to their success.
 The SNB's next interest rate decision is on June 17, but
given the euro zone crisis, economists do not expect the bank to
raise rates just yet.
 Interest rate futures indicate the SNB may tighten policy in
in December.
 Swiss imports in April from euro zone members Germany and
Italy saw a ""massive increase"", the customs office said.
 Watch exports rose 11.5 percent in nominal terms from a year
earlier, largely thanks to demand in emerging markets.
 ""Again China and Hong Kong are the growth drivers. The watch
makers are a Chinese story,"" said John Cox, an analyst at Kepler
Capital Markets.

 TUNIS, May 28 (Reuters) - The son-in-law of Tunisia's
president launched the country's first Islamic bank on Friday to
tap into growing demand for alternative finance and investment
products in the secular-leaning country.
 North Africa has begun to embrace Islamic finance after
years watching from the sidelines, partly to channel more Arab
Gulf petrodollars into the region.
 Sharia-compliant finance bans the receipt of interest and
investments in companies dealing in alcohol and gambling. The
global industry is estimated to be worth around $1 trillion,
according to sector analysts.
 Azzitouna Bank, set up with capital of $30 million, will
develop Islamic loan and saving products for businesses and
individuals, said Sakher Materi, who is married to the daughter
of 73-year-old President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.
 ""Azzitouna Bank will develop a comprehensive and innovative
range of banking products and services ... in accordance with
the principles of Islamic finance,"" Materi said.
 Materi leads Princesse Holding, which contributed 51 percent
of the capital with the rest shared by local partners. Capital
is expected to grow to $71 million in 2011, he said.
 The bank is starting with nine branches and managers want to
grow to 20 next year.
 State news agency TAP said Azzitouna would have a mission to
promote commerce across the Maghreb. North Africa has one of the
weakest levels of cross-border trade in the world.
 Tunisia has one of the most open economies in the region and
attracts substantial investment from the European Union,
something that is expected to accelerate after 2014, when the
government has said it will make the currency fully convertible.
 Tunisia and Morocco authorised Islamic finance in 2007,
partly to channel more investment into their fast-growing
tourism and real estate industries.
 Several Moroccan banks now offer Islamic finance products
but they have been slow to catch on, with some consumers
complaining of uncompetitive commercial terms. Islamists have
blamed the government for deliberately hindering their growth.

 LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday, nearing
an end to a month to forget for the single currency as euro zone
sovereign risk concerns sparked its worst crisis since its
inception 11 years ago.
 The euro has fallen some 12 cents against the dollar in the
month to hit a 4-year low of $1.2143. It is on track for a hefty
6.7 percent monthly decline, which would be the biggest drop
since January 2009 as well as the sixth straight monthly fall.

 His firm forecasts the euro to rebound to $1.26 in the next
month, but to fall to $1.10 in 12-months time.
 
 MONTH-END FIXING
 On the day, the euro gained on month-end fixing demand for
euros, as well as position-squaring before a long weekend in
both the U.S. and UK markets.
 But the euro's upside was limited as options with a strike
price of $1.2400 were set to expire later in the day.
 By 1115 GMT, the euro rose 0.1 percent at $1.2386 ,
after rising to $1.2452.
 ""There seem to be a lot of month-end fixings and the euro is
gaining from these. No matter how bad things are, if the
market's positioning is all one way then there's a bit of a need
for a breather,"" one London-based trader said.
 The euro gained more than 1.5 percent on Thursday after
China reaffirmed its commitment to diversify currency holdings
away from the dollar, easing concerns that the euro may be
quickly losing favour as a reserve currency.
 Analysts said a key support level was $1.2135, the 50

 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - European trade unions are facing
up to a difficult choice: acquiesce to austerity measures and
infuriate members, or fight them with strikes and risk a market
backlash that could make the economic situation worse.
 At one extreme is Ireland, where unions have avoided
widespread industrial action over existing cuts -- some of the
earliest and sharpest in Western Europe -- in part because the
resulting market reaction would hurt workers more.
 Trade union congress leader Jack O'Connor told Reuters last
week that he feared foreign investors would interpret serious
strikes as a sign Ireland might not be able to push through cuts
and meet debt obligations, leaving it unable to borrow.
 ""Even if you win (the strike campaign), you could end up
losing,"" he said -- but he said the decision was costing him
sleepless nights and would not rule out further strikes if the
government pushed through new cuts.
 At the other extreme is Greece -- where the European Union
and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are demanding harsh
spending cuts -- where unions say they will strike in June and
push for Europe-wide action against austerity measures.
 ""We'll be pushing until the end to prevent the worst,"" GSEE
union head Yannis Panagopoulos, promising maximum resistance to
a bill that raises the retirement age and curtails early
pensions.
 Panagopoulos says he is already talking to other European
unions and hopes they can work together to hold back a wave of
austerity measures as governments pull back on stimulus spending
and start to address deficits. [ID:nLDE64Q0S6]
 An increasing number of European countries are announcing
austerity measures to placate nervous bond markets. Spain,
Portugal, Britain, Italy, Holland and France all announced new
steps in recent weeks. [ID:nnLDE64Q1OF]
 
 EUROPE-WIDE ACTION UNLIKELY
 Unions have tended to respond with open hostility,
complaining the poor and public sector workers are being made to
pay the cost of the mistakes of the rich. 
 Italian unions say they will strike in June, while Spanish
unions have threatened action if labour laws are changed without
their consent.
 Europe's unions will hold a scheduled quarterly meeting in
Brussels on June 1. But with electorates in northern Europe in
particular already angry over having to bail out Greece, few see
any real prospect of a concerted campaign of solidarity.
 ""It's hard to see this really bringing the masses onto the
streets in Liverpool or Lubeck,"" said David Lea, Western Europe
analyst at Control Risks. ""The Irish example is very
instructive. There is a lot of soul-searching going on within
unions and the emergence of the bond market as a political
arbiter is weighing on their minds more than they might admit.""
 The widespread market alarm -- hitting not just Greek debt
but also the euro -- that followed protests in Athens that led
to violence and the death of three in a burning bank is seen as
a warning.
 ""The Irish unions have it right,"" said Elizabeth Stephens,
head of credit and political risk at London insurance broker
Jardine Lloyd Thompson. 
 ""My worry would be that the Greek unions may win in the
short term and prompt an end to the measures but the crisis of
confidence that would produce could lead to default. The
economic damage would mean the unions would not stay powerful
for long.""
 A Greek march last week drew only half the crowd seen in
the May 5 protests, while in France the government signalled it
would push ahead with plans to raise the pension age after weak
protests. [ID:nLDE64R0F8]
 
 PUBLIC SUPPORT LIMITED
 ""The public support just isn't there,"" said Control Risks'
Lea. ""The unions will need to take some action to avoid
accusations of irrelevance but it will be limited.""
 A Europe-wide day of protest -- probably not explicitly tied
to Greece -- is possible, analysts say, but would likely only be
observed by more leftist unionists with turnout perhaps
strongest in Italy but weaker elsewhere.
 After Greece, Italy is seen as probably the next most
vulnerable country to labour unrest with unions already at
loggerheads with Silvio Berlusconi's government -- although
unions there tend to strike for hours rather than days, reducing
both the impact and market alarm.
 Spain's unions are seen likely to protest but ultimately
acquiesce to cuts, as are Portugal's
 ""In Spain, the unions know that at the end of the day if
they bring down the leftist government the right will get back
in,"" said Exclusive Analysis analyst Pepe Egger.
 In Britain, trade union UNITE is locked in a row with
British Airways but analysts say the labour movement will likely
take a less aggressive line against austerity measures from a
newly elected coalition government.
 ""The British Airways case is really a one-off,"" said Control
Risks' Lea.""Again, It just comes down to public support.""
 Even Greek union boss Panagopoulos concedes cultural
differences across Europe make coordinated action hard.
 ""Scandinavians act differently and think southern Europeans
act strangely, central Europeans also have a different way,"" he
said. ""It is very difficult.""

 * Germany at odds with EU partners, makes own proposals
 * EU Institutions act slowly, doubts over Belgian presidency
 By Timothy Heritage
 BRUSSELS, May 28 (Reuters) - Three weeks after it agreed a
$1 trillion safety net to protect the euro, the European Union
is struggling to convince financial markets it has got what it
takes to save the currency.
 Since the safety net was agreed early on May 10 to appease
markets worried that Greece's debt problems could be contagious,
countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal have announced
austerity plans to head off any crisis.
 But new divisions, above all a rift between Germany and
nearly all the other 26 member states, have renewed doubts about
the EU's ability to unite behind the painful reforms needed to
hold the 16-country euro area together.
Concerns are also growing because Belgium is unlikely to
have a government in place when it takes over the EU presidency
on July 1 and markets are worried the EU's institutions and
leaders are ill-equipped to handle a crisis of this magnitude.
 ""We are at a crossroads today. Either we take determined and
joint action for Europe's economic and political revival or we
face economic stagnation and political irrelevance,"" EU Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said this week.
 It would be easy to assume such apocalyptic visions would
reassure markets that the EU has grasped the gravity of the
situation. But a decline in the value of the euro and falls on
stock markets this month suggest otherwise.
 A ban imposed by Germany last week on certain financial
transactions to quell the market ""speculators"" it blames for the
euro's problems has caused particular alarm.
 Berlin compounded the problem by saying this week it would
extend to other transactions its ban on some naked short-selling
-- the sale of financial instruments without first borrowing the
security or ensuring it can be borrowed.
 Economic analysts say markets have seen this move as a sign
that Germany, Europe's biggest economy, may still think the
markets are to blame for the crisis, rather than structural
problems and imbalances between the EU states' economies.
 
 GERMAN MOVES LIKELY TO AGGRAVATE MARKETS
 ""This is the worst possible message they could be sending
the markets because it suggests they are still not acknowledging
what the underlying problem here is,"" said Simon Tilford, chief
economist at the Centre for European Reform think-tank.
 ""Far from reassuring the market and stabilising market
sentiment, this will further undermine confidence in the ability
of euro zone governments and policymakers to get on top of the
crisis. It will aggravate the situation further.""
 Germany has, with France, long been the engine driving the
EU towards closer political and economic coordination. That is
changing because German taxpayers now fear they will have to
bail out one profligate euro zone member after another.
 In efforts to satisfy a public that seems less pro-Europe
than in the past, the German government has become isolated in
Europe and faces a battle with the executive European Commission
over reforms of the budget rules that govern the EU.
 Germany says the Commission's plans do not go far enough and
has made its own nine-point proposal, leading to unusually
bitter squabbles with Brussels.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso described
Germany's calls to change the EU treaty to enact reforms as
""naive"" this week, using unusually tough language to criticise
the most powerful member state.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel may have won over some of her
domestic critics, and has shown she wants to shake the EU into
action by taking a tough stance on the budget rules, but she has
alienated her EU partners and upset the markets.
 ""This has obviously created instability on the markets
because markets do not really like Germany acting on its own.
They would much rather there is an agreement across the EU,""
Sharon Bowles, head of the European Parliament's economic and
monetary affairs committee, told Reuters.
 Germany's spat with the Commission, and increasingly with
France, augurs badly for prospects of a quick agreement on
reforms to boost growth, reduce unemployment and make the
flagging European economies more competitive.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy hardly helped Merkel by
declaring the May 10 agreement a victory for France.

 CONCERNS OVER GERMANY BASHING
 ""If this Germany bashing continues, Germany will become an
even more problematic actor in EU politics and it will be harder
to find compromises in the EU,"" said Janis Emmanouilidis
of the European Policy Centre think-tank.
 ""You won't get the old Germany back. You need to accommodate
this new player, this changed player.""
 Rehn said this week the failure to carry out tough reforms
could set Europe back a decade.
 He said average annual growth in EU output would be at best
around 1.5 percent, instead of the target of more than 2
percent, and unemployment would be 7 to 8 percent instead of the
target of about 3 percent by the end of the decade.
 Investors are also concerned it will take months to agree on
the reforms and that they will either prompt labour unrest in
some countries or be watered down during negotiations because of
fears they could cause strikes.
 A task force set up by EU President Herman Van Rompuy has
given itself several months to make proposals, reinforcing the
view that the EU cannot act swiftly.
 The fall of Belgium's government, and the likelihood that
lengthy coalition talks will prevent it forming a government
quickly after the June 13 election, also complicates matters.
 The impact of this may be limited by the fact that Spain,
which holds the presidency until June 30, has often seemed a
bystander during the euro zone crisis and the big member states
are likely to continue to pay the lead roles in the crisis.
 Spain's government has also had to focus on its own economic
problems. It won parliament's approval for its austerity plan by
only one vote on Thursday and talks with business and unions on
overhauling rigid labour laws are going badly.
 Van Rompuy has been criticised for his low profile but
supporters say much of his work is done behind the scenes and he
will be vital as his task force presses on with its work.
 The Commission has also been criticised for showing a lack
of leadership, but its ability to act quickly has been hindered
by the disagreements among the member states.
 ""The crisis has not been handled adequately and things went
wrong but this has a lot to do with the magnitude of the
crisis,"" Emmanouilidis said.
 ""Would things be done better with a different institutional
setting? Well, the EU is not a state. You always need to come up
with a consensus and at a time of crisis this is hard.""

 * Risk aversion slightly, but euro zone debt worries remain
 * Euro still on course for 6th monthly fall in a row vs dlr
 
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday as
investors unwound hefty short positions ahead of the month-end,
while the recent extreme risk aversion stemming from euro zone
debt concerns eased.
 Traders said fixings related to position squaring before the
end of the month dominated the session, with many trades brought
forward due to Monday's U.S. and UK public holidays.
 The euro gained more than 1.5 percent on Thursday after
China reaffirmed its commitment to diversify currency holdings
away from the dollar, easing concerns that the euro may be
quickly losing favour as a reserve currency.
 Thursday's Spanish parliament approval of a 15 billion euro
austerity package also brought relief. However, analysts
expected euro gains to be limited as investors stayed mindful of
the severity of the euro zone's debt problems.
 ""There seem to be a lot of month-end fixings and the euro is
gaining from these. No matter how bad things are, if the
market's positioning is all one way then there's a bit of a need
for a breather,"" a London-based trader said.
 ""But there is bound to be more bad news on the horizon,
which will send the euro into another downward spiral.""
 The Spanish package was passed by one vote and investors
were concerned about possible strike action by Spanish unions,
as well as the risk of civil unrest in Greece.
 At 0958 GMT, the euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.2409, having
risen as high as $1.2452, with traders citing buying by a large
European bank, though they also mentioned market talk of options
barriers at $1.2500, which were capping gains.
 Analysts said a key support level was $1.2135, the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the 2000-08 advance, just above
the recent four-year low of $1.2143.
 The euro was up 0.4 percent at 113.12 yen, while it rose 0.4
percent against sterling to 85.09 pence.
 Data last week from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators were heavily short euros to the tune of
107,143 contracts in the week to May 18, although slightly less
than the record net short position the prior week.
 
 TREND STILL DOWN
 Analysts saw the euro's gains over the last two days --
which took it above $1.2400 from the week's low hit on Thursday
of around $1.2152 -- as a temporary reprieve before concerns
stemming from the euro zone crisis return to haunt the currency.
 The euro is set for its sixth consecutive monthly fall
against the dollar and has fallen close to 7 percent in May. 
 ""Our underlying unease with the euro remains. This is one
currency where the market continues to be terrified about what
might be lingering around the next corner,"" Daragh Maher,
currency strategist at Credit Agricole CIB said in a note.
 Charts show a monthly close below $1.2135 would favour more
weakness, with analysts seeing the next downside support at
$1.1640, a trough hit in November 2005.
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent to 91.17 yen, while the dollar
index, which measures the greenback's performance against a
basket of currencies, fell 0.15 percent to 86.048.
 A large amount of options in dollar/yen is expected to
expire during New York trading hours on Friday with a strike at
90.00, and that may provide near-term support to the dollar
against the yen, a senior options manager at a European
investment bank said in a note to clients.

634,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2010 06:03AM ET</span>",ECB's Bini Smaghi-Greece a warning sign to others worldwide," By Marc Jones
 FRANKFURT, May 28 (Reuters) - European Central Bank
policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on Friday the euro zone's
problems were an early warning to the rest of the world and took
a swipe at Germany for fanning the flames of the crisis.
 Bini Smaghi, one of the ECB's six-strong Executive Board,
also slammed predictions that Greece will eventually default on
its debt, saying anything along those lines ""was not a viable
option"" in the eyes of euro zone governments, the ECB and the
IMF.
 In the text of a speech to be delivered at a Group of 30
conference in Rabat, he said the euro zone turmoil, which has
wiped off more than 15 percent of the euro's value since the
start of the year, was a signal to others to fix their finances.
 ""To repeat a much used metaphor, we could say that euro area
tensions are 'the canary in the coal mine' of the challenges
that policymakers worldwide are going to face,"" he said.
 Financial markets were in the process of testing countries'
ability to force through necessary fiscal corrections, he said,
and the problems facing Greece and other financially strained
euro zone members, were already spreading.
 ""Just look at the screens and you'll see the contagion under
way, spreading not only to peripheral countries but also to the
largest euro area countries and through the financial system.""
 There was also a thinly-veiled swipe at Germany for using
alarmist rhetoric to try and garner domestic support for Greek
aid.
 ""In one large euro area country it was thought that public
support for swift action could be achieved only by dramatising
the situation, for instance, by telling the public that
'the euro is in danger',"" he said referring to comments by
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on May 19. [ID:nBAT005472]
 ""But it was not realised that, in the midst of a financial
upheaval, such words are like fanning the flames and that the
cost of the support package could only increase following
such dramatic declarations.""
 Bini Smaghi slammed the idea that Greece's problems would
force it to default on its debt eventually.
 ""The IMF, the euro area governments, the Greek government
and the ECB however take a different view.
 ""They all consider that a default is not a viable solution.
And they have taken decisions consistent with this view and
put money - taxpayers' money - where their mouths are.""
 He also stressed that the ECB would not permit a rise in
inflation to erode the real value of governments' debts.
 There would be grave consequences if Greece was allowed to
default or inflation was allowed to rise.
 ""Sticking to commitments, in particular in the case of the
Greek programme, is essential for the credibility of the (euro)
currency,"" he said.

 GENEVA, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro's depreciation is no
cause for alarm, and will help solve the credit squeeze in the
euro zone, the head of the U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) said on Friday.
 ""I think this is a natural trend,"" UNCTAD Secretary-General
Supachai Panitchpakdi told reporters in Geneva. ""This is
something that will help solve the problems of the euro zone.""
 The UNCTAD chief also said China was stocking up on copper
to get ahead of commodity speculators and said he expected the
price of minerals and other raw materials to remain volatile,
causing strains on both importers and exporters.
 Supachai, who formerly led the World Trade Organisation,
said it was unlikely that G20 leaders would again call for a
quick completion of the Doha Round, given their previous appeals
for a tariff-slashing agreement had little effect.
 ""This has created some kind of loss of credibility,"" he
said, urging countries instead to empower their negotiators to
make the concessions needed to reach the global accord that the
WTO has been struggling to clinch since 2001.
 ""Eventually people will be driven back to the negotiating
table because of the fact that we need to have stimulus in
trade,"" Supachai said, adding it may be necessary to ""calibrate""
expectations on big emerging economies such as India for the
deal to be palatable to all.

 * Crown gains vs euro, dollar
 
(Adds further comment, market reaction)
 STOCKHOLM, May 28 (Reuters) - Sweden's economy grew rather
than contracted at the end of 2009 and the recovery has gained
far more traction than forecast this year, figures showed,
making a July rate hike more likely and boosting the crown
currency.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg said Friday's data, which
showed first quarter gross domestic product grew 1.4 percent
from the previous three months, pointed to a strong upturn and
indicated GDP forecasts might be revised up. [ID:nLDE64R0PP]
 Most Swedish indicators of recent months have provided cause
for optimism following the country's worst recession since World
War Two last year.
 Until the past few weeks, when concerns about Greece's debt
woes spreading to other parts of Europe began to intensify,
analysts had pencilled in July for the first rate hike since the
financial crisis.
 Now with firm evidence Sweden's economy is expanding
robustly, the balance of opinion is again swinging towards the
Riksbank hiking rates from a record low of 0.25 percent this
summer, helping the crown to firm against the euro .
 ""We've said that they will hike in July and this indicates
that they will in fact do this,"" said Annika Winsth, economist
at Nordea.
 ""This is a strong figure and the fact that the profile looks
different, that things have been stronger for a longer period,
that is also a strong signal.""
 The data offered a marked contrast to economic developments
among most of Sweden's European neighbours. First quarter growth
in a euro zone since weighed down by fresh austerity measures in
several states came in at a paltry 0.2 percent, data released
earlier this month showed. [ID:nLDE64B0K0]
 The crown was around 0.6 percent stronger against the euro
on Thursday, trading at around 9.67 against the single currency.
It was nearly 1 percent firmer against the dollar  at
around 7.78 after trading above 8 earlier this week on worries
over fiscal problems in southern Europe. Yields on Swedish bonds
rose .
 
 RECOVERY
 First quarter GDP grew 1.4 percent from the last quarter of
2009 and rose 3.0 percent from a year earlier, Sweden's
statistics office said.
 Quarterly figures for the final three months of last year
were revised to show output grew 0.4 percent. Previously they
had been shown shrinking at a similar pace.
 The figures compared with forecasts for 0.9 percent growth
in the quarter and an expansion of 0.6 percent from a year
earlier, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
[ID:nLDE64N19M]
 The central bank said in April it would soon be time to
start returning borrowing costs to more normal levels, pointing
to either summer or early autumn for a hike.
 Analysts expected worries over the housing market and
surging lending to push the Riksbank into moving sooner rather
than later, but Greece's debt crisis has made the timing of a
hike more problematic.
 Data published this week also showed an unexpected jump in
unemployment in April, while falling retail sales in April are
another factor which could make the Riksbank more cautious in
raising rates. [ID:nSAC016689]
 The NIER think-tank, which prepares forecasts for the
government, also pointed to muted inflation pressure ahead.
 ""That we now see productivity on its way up is something
that will dampen cost pressures, so it is not self-evident that
one should draw the conclusion that they (the Riksbank) will
carry out a tighter monetary policy due to the (GDP) figure,""
NIER Director Mats Dillen said.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - World equities rose for the third
day running on Friday and the euro extended gains against the
dollar as investors refrained from betting on further trouble in
the euro zone's debt crisis ahead of a holiday in major markets.
 Crude prices advanced to above $75 a barrel, touching a
two-week high, while the cost of protection against government
debt default in Greece and other peripheral euro zone sovereigns
fell.
 Fears that other euro zone countries could head the way of
Greece had sparked a sell-off in financial markets around the
globe. But there has been no major shock from Spain, Portugal or
Ireland to spook markets in recent sessions.
 Investors are also squaring positions so as not to be
exposed through a long holiday weekend in London and New York.
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2418 on Friday. But it has
fallen 6.6 percent against the dollar this month and is set to
register its sixth consecutive monthly loss.
 ""There seem to be a lot of month-end fixings and the euro is

market's positioning is all one way then there's a bit of a need
for a breather,"" a London-based currency trader said.
 ""But there is bound to be more bad news on the horizon,

 The single currency gained more than 1.5 percent against the
dollar on Thursday after China reaffirmed its commitment to
diversify currency holdings away from the greenback and denied
it was reviewing its holdings of euro assets.
 Euro gains on Friday came despite signs from Spain that
talks with unions and business to overhaul rigid labour laws
were going badly, casting doubt over reforms crucial to reassure
markets about the country's long-term solvency.
 European Central Bank policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said
the euro zone's problems were an early warning to the rest of
the world.
 
 STOCKS REBOUND
 Stocks were also helped by a relatively strong economic
picture in the United States and emerging economies, as well as
robust corporate earnings.
 Global equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
advanced 0.8 percent to hit a one-week high. The index,
however, is down 9 percent this month, on track for its worst
monthly loss since February 2009.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index added 0.5 percent, while
Tokyo's Nikkei average rose 1.3 percent in its best one-day
performance for two weeks as exporter shares climbed on a halt
in the yen's advance.
 U.S. stock index futures gained about 0.2 percent,
indicating a firmer start for Wall Street.
 Some analysts were still pessimistic.
 ""This recovery rally could soon hit resistance on the
upside. This week's low point wasn't the capitulation point, so
the risk is still on the downside,"" said Alexandre Le Drogoff,
technical analyst at Aurel BGC.
 The cost of insuring Greek government debt fell to 655 basis
points, 27 bps tighter than on Thursday, according to
credit-default swaps monitor Markit. The CDS of other peripheral
sovereign issuers, such as Portugal and Ireland also fell.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year Bunds fell 3 bps to 2.690
percent, while those on 10-year U.S. Treasuries dipped 3 bps to
3.3272 percent.
 In the commodity market, copper prices gained for the third
straight day, up 0.6 percent on better risk appetite.

 LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro dipped versus the dollar
on Friday, paring hefty gains made the previous day, as
investors squared positions ahead of the month-end while worries
over the impact of the euro zone debt crisis capped rallies.
 The euro gained more than 1.5 percent against the dollar on
Thursday after China reaffirmed its commitment to diversifying
currency holdings away from the dollar and denied it was
reviewing its holdings of euro sovereign bonds
 A Spanish parliament vote on Thursday to approve a 15
billion euro austerity package also provided relief. However, it
passed by a single vote and investors were concerned about
possible strike action by Spanish unions.
 Analysts and traders expect trade to be dominated by
month-end position adjustment, with UK and U.S. markets closed
on Monday for a public holiday.
 ""The trend is clearly there for more euro weakness and the
focus will be on what is happening to the Spanish banking sector
and whether there is anything that could ruin this recovery in
risk appetite,"" said Carl Hammer, SEB currency strategist in
Stockholm.
 ""But the market has come to a more mature level (in
euro/dollar) and the euro could rebound short-term due to
extreme short euro positioning,"" he said.
 At 0746 GMT, the euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.2335 after
rising close to $1.2400 the previous session when stops above
$1.2340 were triggered.
 Analysts said a key support level was $1.2135, the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the 2000-08 advance, just above
the recent four-year low of $1.2143.
 The euro is down against the dollar more than 7 percent on
the month and set for its sixth consecutive monthly fall. Charts
show a monthly close below $1.2135 would favour more weakness,
with the next downside support at $1.1640, a trough hit in
November 2005.
 ""The euro zone's fiscal problems are deep-seated. No one is
truly confident about the euro right now and people think
$1.2400 is probably the highest it can reach,"" a senior trader
at a Japanese securities firm in Tokyo said.
 Against the yen, the euro fell 0.1 percent to 112.54. On
Thursday, it climbed 2.7 percent for its biggest one-day
percentage rise in 15 months.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 91.25 yen, while the dollar
index, which measures the greenback's performance against a
basket of currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 86.494.
 A large amount of options in dollar/yen is expected to
expire during New York trading hours on Friday with a strike at

against the yen, a senior options manager at a European

 The options manager said positions at options desks are
gamma short in yen crosses, a factor that has contributed to
their recent market swings. With gamma shorts, options desks
tend to chase spot moves, to hedge their books.

 SALTAIRE, England, May 28 (Reuters) - The rise in British

will need to set interest rates to control it, Prime Minister

 In a speech later, Cameron said his government's plans to

economic recovery and ease inflationary pressures.
 ""Our budget deficit is set to overtake Greece,"" Cameron told
business leaders in Saltaire, northern England. ""If we don't
deal with this, there will be no growth, there will be no
recovery.""
 Cameron's concerns about rising inflation appear to
contradict assurances from the Bank of England that a recent
spike -- to nearly double the 2 percent target in April -- is
temporary and will subside over the coming year.
 ""Policy set independently by the Bank of England, that is
the right way to do things,"" Cameron told GMTV.
 ""We have seen a slightly worrying increase in inflation in
recent months so interest rates will be set to control
inflation.""
 Conservative leader Cameron, who became prime minister
earlier this month after forming a coalition with the smaller
Liberal Democrats, has been outspoken about monetary policy in
the past -- an area usually avoided by government ministers.
 At the Conservative conference in October 2009, Cameron,
then in opposition, said ""printing money leads to inflation"". He
was referring to the Bank of England's quantitative easing
programme, under which it bought assets with newly created cash.
 
 BANK LEVY
 Earlier this week the OECD said the Bank should raise
interest rates no later than the fourth quarter of 2010 due to
the gradual drift up of some measures of inflation expectations.
 However, if rates go up to contain inflationary pressures,
analysts say there will be little to protect the still frail
economy from sweeping government spending cuts.
 The Office for National Statistics said this week the
economy grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, up from an
initial estimate of 0.2 percent.
 In his first major speech since taking office, Cameron said
the coalition's emergency budget on June 22 would outline how
the deficit -- running close to 11 percent of gross domestic
product -- would be dealt with over the next few years.
 He warned that failing to take action now would kill off
Britain's recovery from the worst recession since World War Two.
 ""Getting the deficit down and keeping it down will ... allow
interest rates to remain lower for longer,"" he said.
 The coalition has outlined this week an initial 6.2 billion
pounds ($8.9 billion) of spending cuts this year.
 Cameron also said he and his finance minister, George
Osborne, would be pressing for an international agreement on
some form of banking levy at meetings with their G20
counterparts in Korea and Canada in June.
 ""Given all the money that the public had to put into the
banks, the idea of a modest bank levy going into the future
makes sense,"" Cameron said.
 ""I'm pretty hopeful that other countries -- and speaking to
the French and the Germans and listening to what (U.S.)
President (Barack) Obama has said -- pretty hopeful that can
happen.""
 Asked about the problems still faced by many British
businesses in accessing credit to keep their operations running
smoothly, Cameron said he was aware of the problem and it was
""absolutely vital"" for the government to help address it.
 ""We are looking specifically at loan guarantees and the
existing government schemes and can we expand them. We are also
looking at net lending agreements with banks and how they can
work better,"" Cameron said.

641,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2010 03:59AM ET</span>",Taiwan eyes delay in China trade deal," * Negotiators may miss goal to sign pact in June
 * Two sides at odds over import tariff details - local
media
 * Taiwan president needs deal for good poll showing
 (For full trade deal coverage, see [ID:nTOE64D06L])
 TAIPEI, May 28 (Reuters) - A landmark China-Taiwan trade
deal scheduled to be signed in June could be pushed back as the
two sides wrangle over import tariffs, the government and
analysts said on Friday.
 Unless Taiwan gets a deal it wants, it will scrap a June
signing target for the controversial economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, which may unsettle
Taiwan markets after months of expecting smooth completion of
the pact.
 Export-reliant Taiwan and economic powerhouse China, which
began talking trade two years ago after decades of political
hostilities, dispute how far Beijing should go in allowing
import tariff cuts for the other side, analysts and local media
say.
 ""In case conditions of the deal do not meet our goals, we'd
rather postpone the signing,"" a Taiwan economics ministry news
official said. ""We won't rule out delaying the deal. And we
can't say whether our goals will be met.""
 Chinese industry and China's other trade partners may cry
foul if too much is ceded to Taiwan, though Premier Wen Jiabao
said in March his government would ""yield benefits"" to the
self-ruled island that Beijing hopes to charm into
reunification through economic incentives.
 A list of 300 items set for tariff cuts is expected to
anchor the trade deal, with auto parts, machinery and
petrochemicals from the $390 billion Taiwan economy seen as
winners.
 Taiwan wants to add another 100 items, the details of which
have worried Beijing, the local China Times newspaper said.
 Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou needs a strong deal to help
his Nationalist Party win Nov. 27 local elections seen as a
bellwether for the 2012 presidential race against the
anti-China main opposition, analysts say.
Taiwan's ties with China have improved since Ma took office
two years ago and spurned the pro-independence position of his
predecessor in office. China is Taiwan's biggest trade partner
and number one foreign investor with bilateral trade estimated
at around $100 billion.
 Political opponents say ECFA could lead to overdependence
on China, including an unwelcome flood of cheaper Chinese
goods.
 ""Ma Ying-jeou needs to deliver the beef. We need meat we
can bite into,"" said Raymond Wu, managing director of the
Taipei-based political risk consultancy e-telligence. ""If we
want it signed in June, we might just get a weak framework.""
 A delay should last no more than a few months as both sides
want the deal, said Kou Chien-wen, assistant political science
professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei.

(Adds shares, background)
 AMSTERDAM, May 28 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said it
would pay $4.7 billion in cash to buy privately held East
Resources Inc, giving it substantially more exposure to crucial
shale gas plays in North America.
 The deal will increase Shell's daily gas production in North
America by about 7.5 percent and give it access to a swathe of
the Marcellus Shale, the northeastern U.S. rock formation that
is one of the crucial sources of future U.S. gas production.
 Shale gas accounts for between 15 percent and 20 percent of
U.S. gas production but is expected to quadruple in coming
years, touching off a scramble among producers large and small
for access to resources.
 Shell shares fell 0.8 percent to 1,800.5 pence in early
London trading, in line with declines in oil indices.
 A Shell spokeswoman said the company was not commenting on
how it intended to finance the purchase. Shell had $8.45 billion
cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at March 31 and
generated nearly $4.8 billion in cash flow from operating
activities in the first quarter.
 ""These acreage additions form part of an on-going strategy,
which also includes divestments, with an objective to grow and
to upgrade the quality of Shell's North America tight gas
portfolio,"" Shell chief executive Peter Voser said.
East controls 650,000 net acres (2,600 square kilometres) in
the Marcellus Shale, and 1.05 million net acres overall.
 The rush for acreage has been met, however, with persistent
weakness in gas prices. Front month gas prices are down more
than 22 percent this year, though after a steady decline they
began to form a bottom in late March.
 Shale gas is also harder and more expensive to extract,
given that it comes from rock and not traditional reservoirs,
further pinching margins.
 Shell said closing the deal was subject to customary
regulatory approvals. Besides its majority owners, East counts
private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. as an investor
and Jefferies & Co. as an advisor.
 The acquisition came hours after the U.S. government said it
would review Shell's plans to begin drilling exploratory wells
off Alaska this summer.
 The already controversial project has faced increased
scrutiny in recent weeks in the wake of the massive BP oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico.

 HONG KONG, May 28 (Reuters) - Asian stocks bolted on Friday
posting their third straight day of gains after China's pledge
to remain invested in Europe boosted confidence, but the euro
dipped after rebounding from near four-year lows the previous
day.
 European shares opened higher, with Britain's FTSE 100

The return of the appetite for risk pushed the Japanese yen
lower, boosting exporter shares in Tokyo.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose
2.1 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, adding to the previous day's 2.2

 The People's Bank of China said on Thursday a Financial
Times report that Beijing was concerned about its euro-zone
bond holdings due to the European debt crisis was groundless.
[ID:nTOE64Q04P]
 The report had driven the euro to a near four-year low
against the dollar and near an 8-1/2-year low against the yen,
and soured risk appetite globally as investors worried that
Europe's debt woes would grow into a larger financial crisis.
 Beijing's denial fuelled a rally on Wall Street, with the
benchmark S&P 500 marking the biggest percentage gain in nearly
three weeks.
 In Asia, energy <.MIAPJEN00PUS> and financial services

 The euro handed back some gains as worries about Europe's
debt problems returned to haunt investors who sold into the
single currency's strength.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was down 0.1 percent from
late New York at $1.2298 against the dollar.
 ""In our view, uncertainty remains in Europe and the sources

 ""It could come from the negative economic impact of the

percent and 3.1 percent against the dollar, respectively.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro edged lower on Friday,
giving back some of the hefty gains made the previous day after
China assured investors it was not losing confidence in euro zone
assets.
 The euro dipped 0.4 percent to $1.2307 after having gained
over 1.5 percent in the previous session when stops above $1.2340
were triggered, traders said.
 Still, the euro is down more than 7 percent on the month and
charts indicate a monthly close below $1.2135 would favour
additional weakness with the next downside support seen near
$1.1640 -- a trough hit in November 2005.
 Near-term support is at $1.2135, the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the 2000-08 advance. That lies just under the
euro's four-year low of $1.2143 struck last week on trading
platform EBS.
 A trader for a Japanese bank said the euro's dip on Friday
was likely due to selling by Japanese exporters.
 ""Since the euro has rebounded from levels around 109 yen or
so, selling tends to emerge in Tokyo trading hours,"" he said,
referring to the euro's recent bounce off of an 8-½ year low of
108.83 yen hit earlier in the week.
 Medium-sized Japanese exporters have fallen behind in taking
care of their euro-selling needs compared with major exporters,
and may sell the euro again next month, the trader added.
 ""Medium-sized exporters still have some exposure they need to
take care of in June ... and they may sell again toward the
month-end,"" he said.
 The euro dipped 0.5 percent against the yen to 112.07 yen,
easing back after climbing 2.7 percent on Thursday for its
biggest one-day percentage rise in 15 months.
 The euro had slipped back towards its four-year low against
the dollar on Thursday after the Financial Times reported that
Beijing was concerned about its euro zone bond investments. But
China's central bank on Thursday said the report was groundless.
 South Korea's central bank also said it has no plans to
reduce euro assets in its foreign reserves, the world's
sixth-largest.
 Market players said the reassuring comments from global
reserve managers prompted investors to cover short positions in
the euro, but added that the euro still faced downside risks.
 ""Headline risk has potential to lift euro temporarily,
especially given the presence of a significant position overhang
in that currency, but the near-term trend is clear, and downside
pressure on the euro is unlikely to dissipate quickly,"" JPMorgan
said in a morning note.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 91.14 yen.
 A large amount of options in dollar/yen are expected to
expire during New York trading hours on Friday with a strike at
90.00, and that may provide near-term support to the dollar
against the yen, a senior options manager at a European
investment bank said in a note to clients.
 The options manager said positions at options desks are gamma
short in yen crosses, a factor that has contributed to their
recent market swings.
 With gamma shorts, options desks tend to chase spot moves, up
or down, to hedge their books.

(Adds background)
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, May 28 (Reuters) - Japan expects Group of 20 finance
leaders to discuss Europe's debt problems and how they are
affecting currency markets, Finance Minister Naoto Kan said on
Thursday.
 The euro fell to a four-year low against the dollar and an
8-½ year low versus the yen this month as investors dumped the
currency on worries about Europe's public finances. It has
bounced back somewhat but the rebound lacks strength on
persistent worries about the region's debt woes.
 ""Depending on the countries, there will be some interest in
currency issues,"" Kan told a news conference. ""I expect the G20
to discuss how the situation in Europe is affecting currencies.""
 G20 policymakers will meet on June 4-5 in the South Korean
port city of Busan to lay the groundwork for a summit of G20
leaders in Toronto on June 26-27.
 ""Europe's problems are affecting other countries through
exports to Europe. So that's going to be a major topic,"" said
Kan, who plans to attend the G20 gathering.
 Japan views the euro's falls against the yen as unlikely to
severely hurt exports as shipments to Europe make up only about
10 percent of total Japanese exports to the world.
 Still, the euro's weakness is unwelcome news for many
Japanese exporters, who have set their currency assumption rates
for euro/yen at 120-125 yen for the year to March. That is much
higher than the euro's current levels around 111 yen.
 Japanese policymakers worry that if the market turmoil
stemming from Europe's debt problems persist, it may hurt
business sentiment and affect the country's fragile and
export-reliant recovery.
 Kan also said financial regulation will also be a major topic
at the G20 meeting, Kan said, although he did not elaborate on
Japan's stance on the issue.
 The Group of 20 developing and developed economies agreed
last year to toughen global banking rules to make another
meltdown less likely, focusing on capital and leverage standards.
 The United States and EU countries favour new bank taxes and
want them to be global. But countries whose banks did not come
close to collapse -- such as Canada, Australia and most emerging
economies -- are opposed.
 Japan has said there is no need for it to take such
additional steps as it has already introduced a similar scheme
called a deposit insurance system.

 SYDNEY, May 28 (Reuters) - The euro steadied higher on
Friday, benefiting from a short-covering bounce after China
assured investors it was not losing confidence in euro zone
assets, while higher-yielding currencies held on to broad gains.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was broadly steady around
$1.2350, having gained over 1.5 percent in the previous session

 Still, the euro is down about 7 percent on the month and

target to watch.
 Near term, support is at $1.2135, the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the 2000-08 advance. Traders said there were
offers lined up at around $1.2200, although investors were
looking to sell the currency at every uptick.
 ""Headline risk has potential to lift euro temporarily,
especially given the presence of a significant position overhang
in that currency, but the near-term trend is clear, and downside
pressure on the euro is unlikely to dissipate quickly,"" JPMorgan
said in a morning note.
 Speculators and funds have gone short against the euro in
droves in recent months on escalating worries about Greece and
related sovereign debt problems. Those worries are now spreading
to the region's banking sector with U.S. banks wary of lending to
European banks with significant exposure to euro zone's debt.
 The euro had fallen to a near four-year low against the
dollar on Thursday after the Financial Times reported that
Beijing was concerned about its euro zone bond investments. But
China's central bank on Thursday said the report was groundless.

 South Korea's central bank also said it has no plans to

 Analysts said the reassuring comments from global reserve
managers prompted investors to cover short positions in the euro.
 As a result, the euro bounced back, rallying more than 3
percent against the yen. The euro was firmer on the yen
 at 112.23 yen, rebounding sharply from its 8-1/2-yr
low of 108.78 struck earlier this week.
 The yen , which is in great demand when investor risk
appetite suffers, was sold off as investors veered towards
riskier assets and higher yielding currencies like the Australian
and New Zealand dollars.
 The Australian dollar  was at $0.8470, having risen
more than 3.5 percent against its U.S. counterpart on Thursday.
The New Zealand dollar  was at $0.6810 after gaining 3.1
percent in the previous session.
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> was down over 1 percent at
86.317. On Thursday, data showed the U.S. economy grew at a
slightly slower pace than previously estimated in the first
quarter but the recovery still appeared solid, suggesting the
economy could withstand fallout from a European debt crisis.

648,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2010 07:03PM ET</span>",Cameron says Britain must rebalance its economy," * Cameron says UK economy has become over-indebted, unstable
 * Says debt is warning sign Britain is on wrong track
 
 LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron said
on Friday that Britain must rebalance an economy that has become
over-indebted, unstable and too dependent on the public sector.
 In excerpts released in advance of a speech he was due to
give later on Friday in northern England, Cameron said the
British economy had been heading in the wrong direction for
years, was over-reliant on welfare and increasingly hostile to
enterprise.
 It was billed as his first major speech since he became
prime minister this month, ending 13 years of Labour Party rule.
 Cameron, whose centre-right Conservatives formed a coalition
with the smaller, centre-left Liberal Democrats after a May 6
election failed to produce an outright winner, has set reducing
Britain's large budget deficit as his top priority.
 ""As a country we have become indebted on an unprecedented
scale. Our huge public debt is the clearest manifestation of our
economic mistakes -- the glaring warning sign overhead telling
us we have taken the wrong route,"" he said.
 ""We have been sleepwalking our way to an economy that is
unsustainable, unstable, unfair and, frankly, uninspiring.""
 The economy had become ""far too dependent on the public
sector, with over half of all jobs created in the last 10 years
associated in some way with public spending,"" he said.
 Referring to London's financial services industry which
drove British growth for years before being jolted by the
financial crisis, Cameron said the economy had become
increasingly unbalanced, ""with our fortunes hitched to a few
industries in one corner of the country, while we let other
sectors like manufacturing slide.""
 Cameron said he believed Britain could rebalance economic
power across different regions and industries, inject new life
into the private sector and move to an economy built on savings
and investment rather than debt and borrowing.
 ""We have set out a series of clear, transparent benchmarks
for our economy, from ensuring macroeconomic stability to
creating more balanced growth, getting Britain working and
ensuring our whole country shares in rising prosperity,"" he
said.
 Cameron's coalition outlined this week 6.2 billion pounds
($8.9 billion) of spending cuts this year. Further action to
tackle a deficit running at 11 percent of GDP -- just a few
percentage points below that of Greece -- is expected in an
emergency budget on June 22.
 However, senior lawmakers from Cameron's Conservative Party
are unhappy at plans to raise capital gains tax to bring it
close to income tax rates, a policy promoted by the Lib Dems.
 Cameron inherited an economy just emerging from deep
recession. The Office for National Statistics said this week the
economy grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, up from an
initial estimate of 0.2 percent.

 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro staged a broad rally
and U.S. stocks jumped about 3 percent on Thursday, after China
said Europe remains a key investment market for its
foreign-exchange reserves.
 The People's Bank of China said a Financial Times report
that Beijing was concerned about its euro-zone bond holdings
due to the European debt crisis was groundless. The report had
driven the euro to a near four-year low on Wednesday and cut
short a rally in U.S. stocks.
 Stocks in Europe and emerging markets also jumped and crude
oil prices jumped 4 percent as the perceived risk that China
might change the composition of its foreign exchange reserves
was reduced.
 ""Reports from the front suggested that investors might
become frightened that China could do something drastic,"" said
Douglas Peta, an independent market strategist in New York.
""Getting some assurance that Chinese sales of European
sovereign debt isn't imminent is making everyone feel better.""
 European shares closed above the 1,000 mark for the first
time in just over a week while government debt prices fell as
the bid for safety ebbed. Stocks in emerging markets also
surged, with Brazil shares up more than 3 percent.
 Bargain hunters picked through stock markets that had been
beaten down by fears that Europe's debt crisis could spark a
credit crunch and undermine the global economic recovery.
 At the close of trade, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> gained 284.54 points, or 2.85 percent, to 10,258.99. The

 The PHLX Semiconductor index <.SOXX> gained 5.2 percent.
Technology stocks had been battered recently due to the

 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> closed up
2.9 percent at 1,000.46 points. The index remains down around
10 percent from a mid-April peak on worries about Europe's debt
crisis. MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
also rose 2.9 percent.
 Banks, which have been heavily hit by concerns about
Europe's debt crisis, rose for a second straight day and were
among the top risers.
 BP  gained 5.9 percent. The company said it was
making progress with its effort to plug its rupturred Gulf of
Mexico oil well.
 EURO GAINS
 The euro gained 1.67 percent at $1.237 while the dollar
fell against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with
the U.S. dollar index <.DXY> falling 1.05 percent at 86.208.
 Stock market gains also supported the euro, while the yen
came under broad pressure as investors put on riskier bets
funded by cheap borrowing in the Japanese currency. The dollar
rose 1.38 percent to 91.06 yen  in late New York trade.
 ""We're following the equity markets. The dollar/yen started
to gain some traction ... and that's dragging the whole risk
trade up, which is giving another boost to the euro,"" said Tim
O'Sullivan, chief dealer at Forex.com in Bedminster, New
Jersey.
 China has been trying to diversify its currency reserves to
reduce the dollar's dominance in favor of the euro and yen to
curb risks.
 On Wednesday the euro collapsed 1.5 percent against the
dollar after the Financial Times reported China's State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) was meeting foreign
bankers because of concerns about its exposure to debt troubles
in Europe.
 SAFE, the arm of the central bank, manages China's $2.4
trillion in foreign exchange reserves -- the world's largest
stockpile.
 Separately, the Kuwaiti Investment Authority on Thursday
denied a local media report that it, too, was reducing its
exposure to euro zone investments. The sovereign wealth fund
stated there was no change to its long-term investment strategy
including Europe.
 In response to the better risk appetite, safe-haven
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded 1-12/32 lower, driving
the yield up to 3.35 percent .
 Euro zone government bond futures settled 39 ticks lower at
128.33, well off the session low of 128.34 .
 Crude oil prices posted their biggest two-day gain since
mid-August, as a forecast for an intense Atlantic hurricane
season fueled fears of disruptions in U.S. supplies and spurred
speculative buying. Oil had also risen more than 4 percent on
Wednesday.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  settled up $3.04, or 4.25
percent, to $74.55 per barrel, and spot gold prices  rose
$2.20, or 0.18 percent, to $1212.10. Gold is up about 3 percent
this week.

 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Oil jumped 4 percent on
Thursday and posted its biggest two-day gain since mid-August
as China's assurance about its euro-zone investments sparked a
global rebound in equities and fed more bets for riskier
assets.
 Oil also rose as a forecast for an intense Atlantic
hurricane season fueled fears of disruption in U.S. supplies,
also prompting speculative buying.
 Prices were already up more than 3 percent before the
government released its initial forecast for this year's storm
season.
 ""The NOAA forecast calling for an intense Atlantic
hurricane season this year is having an impact on oil futures,
with storm premium being factored into prices,"" said Phil
Streible, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 ""This adds to the earlier boost that came from higher
equities. We've also seen a weakening of the dollar ... that
has encouraged speculators to buy in,"" Streible said.
 The day's rally was a follow-through of Wednesday's heady
advance that was supported by encouraging demand for U.S. fuels
last week as reported by the government, even though domestic
crude stocks continued to rise. [EIA/S]
 U.S. crude futures for July delivery  settled $3.04
higher, up 4.25 percent, at $74.55 a barrel. That extended
gains in two days to 8.4 percent, the biggest since a two-day
advance on Aug. 18-19. July crude has recovered from Tuesday's
low of $67.15, the contract's lowest since July 2009.
 ICE Brent July crude futures  gained $2.92, or 4
percent, to settle at $74.66. Brent also gained for two
straight days, advancing 7.3 percent in that period, after nine
losing sessions.

 At one point, U.S. crude gained as much as 24 cents against

fell to a discount as deep as $6.57 in mid-May due to a
build-up in crude stored in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery hub
for oil futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 But Wednesday's data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration showed inventories at the hub slipped in the
week to May 21 for the first time in nine weeks, narrowing the
WTI/Brent spread. 
 However, on Thursday industry data provider Genscape said
that inventories there hit another record high in the week to
May 25, rising 478,000 barrels to 39.9 million barrels, from a

 A forecast by the top U.S. government climate agency that

 In its first outlook for the storm season that begins next

(Adds quotes, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Thursday after China said Europe remains a key investment
market for its foreign-exchange reserves while a global stocks
rally buoyed risk appetite.
 China's central bank said a Financial Times report on
Wednesday that Beijing was concerned about its euro zone bond
holdings was groundless. The report had driven the euro to a
near four-year low against the dollar earlier in the global
session.
 Strong gains in European and U.S. shares also helped
support the euro, while the yen came under broad pressure as
investors put on riskier bets funded by cheap borrowing in the
Japanese currency.
 ""In general, we're seeing an unraveling of yesterday's
action,"" said Tim O'Sullivan, chief dealer at Forex.com in
Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""We're following the equity markets. The dollar/yen started
to gain some traction ... and that's dragging the whole risk
trade up, which is giving another boost to the euro,"" he said.
 In late New York trading, the euro traded 1.6 percent
higher at $1.2364, well of a session high of $1.2395, according
to electronic trading platform EBS. It had earlier fallen to a
near four-year low of $1.2154.
 Kuwait Investment Authority on Thursday also denied a media
report that it is reducing its exposure to euro zone
investments and affirmed it is a long-term investor in Europe.
 Meanwhile, South Korea's central bank said it has no plans
to reduce euro assets in its foreign reserves, the world's
sixth-largest.
 Analysts said the comments from global reserve managers
prompted investors to cover short positions in the euro, which
has taken a beating the last few months.
 ""A lot of this euro rally is due to short-covering given a
'risk on' environment. This is also a relief rally on the back
of the Chinese story,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX
research at GFT in New York.
 ""It's not because investors are more upbeat about the
future. I think they are relieved things are not getting any
worse and there are no exogenous shocks out there for the time
being,"" he added.
 The euro rallied 3 percent against the yen to 112.56 yen,
pulling away from an 8-1/2-year low of 108.83 yen hit this
week.
 The dollar rose 1.1 percent to 90.88 yen.
 Thin volume ahead of market holidays in Britain and the
United States on Monday exacerbated the moves, traders said.
 Despite the denial from China, Alan Ruskin, chief currency
strategist at RBS Global Banking and Markets, said ""it would be
silly"" to think that the recent events in the euro zone have
not changed and won't change China's behavior at all.
 ""No serious investor can be inured to the chilling events
at the euro's periphery and its repercussions for long-term
confidence in the single currency,"" he wrote in a note.
 Higher-yielding, commodity currencies soared as oil prices
climbed. The Australian dollar rose 3.7 percent against its
U.S. counterpart to US$0.8518 and the New Zealand dollar gained
3.1 percent to US$0.6839.
 Earlier in the session, data showed the U.S. economy grew
at a slightly slower pace than previously estimated in the
first quarter but the recovery still appeared solid, suggesting
the economy could withstand fallout from a European debt
crisis.

* Clinton urges new ""national security"" budget
(Adds quotes, updates throughout)
 By Andrew Quinn
 WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - The United States' huge
national debt -- now topping $13 trillion -- is becoming a
major threat to U.S. security and leadership in the world,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Thursday.
 ""The United States must be strong at home in order to be
strong abroad,"" Clinton said in remarks on the Obama
administration's new national security doctrine, which was made
public on Thursday.
 ""We cannot sustain this level of deficit financing and debt
without losing our influence, without being constrained in the
tough decisions we have to make,"" Clinton said, adding that it
was time to ""make the national security case about reducing the
deficit and getting the debt under control.""
 The new Obama security strategy joins diplomatic engagement
with economic discipline and military power to boost America's
standing, and pledges expanded partnerships with rising powers
like India and China to share the global burden.
 Clinton emphasized controlling the budget deficit, saying
it was ""personally painful"" for her to see the yawning U.S.
spending gap after her husband, former President Bill Clinton,
ended his second term in 2001 with budget surpluses.
 ""That was not just an exercise in budgeteering. It was
linked to a very clear understanding of what the United States
needed to do to get positioned to lead for the foreseeable
future, far into the 21st century,"" she said.
 Clinton said that as a Democratic U.S. senator from New
York during the administration of former President George W.
Bush, she had voted against ""tax cuts that were never
sustainable, wars that were never paid for"" -- but without
success.
 ""Now we're paying the piper,"" she said.
 Clinton in February blamed ""outrageous"" advice from Former
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in part for the grim
U.S. deficit picture.
 POLITICALLY TOUGH
 President Barack Obama, who pushed through his own huge
stimulus spending plan last year amid the global financial
crisis, was committed to taking the politically difficult steps
needed to put government finances back in order, Clinton said.
 ""We are in a much stronger economic position than we were.
And that matters. That matters when we go to China. That
matters when we try to influence Russia. That matters when we
talk to our allies in Europe,"" Clinton said.
 Obama has formed an 18-member bipartisan commission to
study ways to reduce the U.S. deficit projected at about $1.5
trillion this year and bring long-term debt to manageable
levels. It aims to find $229 billion in savings in 2015 to
bring the deficit down to 3 percent of the overall economy from
about 10 percent now.
 The U.S. debt this week topped $13 trillion, according to
USDebtClock.org, a website that tracks real-time growth in U.S.
debt. That amounts to about 90 percent of annual gross domestic
product, a level that could start impacting the economy.
 Big budget deficits and rising U.S. debt are becoming major
issues in the run-up to November's congressional elections, and
the European debt crisis that has unnerved financial markets
has fueled these voter concerns.
 While arguing for tighter overall economic discipline,
Clinton said it was no time for the United States to roll back
spending on international diplomatic and development programs,
particularly as civilian agencies take up more of the work in
Iraq and Afghanistan formerly done by the military.
 ""In order for us to meet the obligations that are now being
asked of our civilian personnel, it costs money,"" Clinton said,
adding that it was time to look at an overall ""national
security budget"" that would encompass funding for diplomatic,
development and military operations.
 ""You cannot look at a defense budget, a State Department
budget and a USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development)
budget without defense overwhelming the combined efforts of the
other two and without us falling back into the old stovepipes
that I think are no longer relevant for the challenges of
today,"" Clinton said.

 TORONTO, May 27 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar surged to
its highest level in a week against the U.S. currency on
Thursday as relieved investors returned to riskier assets after
China said Europe remains a key market for its foreign exchange
reserves.
 The Canadian dollar shot up almost 2 U.S. cents, or nearly
2 percent, to hit a session high of C$1.0487 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.36 U.S. cents, as oil topped $74 a barrel and
global stocks rallied sharply. [O/R] [.N] [.TO]
 ""I think what we've seen is a dramatic reversal in risk
sentiment, triggered in large part by the denial of Chinese
officials overnight of the rumors that they were divesting
themselves of euro-denominated assets,"" said Millan Mulraine,
economics strategist at TD Securities.
 ""That certainly helped the shift that we saw beginning
yesterday, with investors getting a better flavor for
increasing their appetite for risk.""
 As a result, the euro, which in recent weeks has become a
proxy for risk appetite, surged across the board on the
comments from Beijing. [FRX/] [ID:nTOE64Q04P]
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0500 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.24 U.S. cents,
decidedly higher than Wednesday's close at C$1.0686 to the U.S.
dollar, or 93.58 U.S. cents.
 Also buoying sentiment for the currency were rising
expectations that the Bank of Canada will hike rates on June 1,
with the market pricing in more than a 70 percent chance on
Thursday afternoon, compared with only about a 50 percent
chance on Wednesday. [BOCWATCH]
 In a Reuters poll released Thursday, all of Canada's
primary securities dealers and most other global forecasters
predicted the Bank of Canada will start raising interest rates
next week as the economy roars ahead. [ID:nTOR007523]
 ""Our view is that they do hike rates because the Bank of
Canada has made it very, very clear that they don't lose focus,
and they focus on fundamentals, namely inflation,"" said Camilla
Sutton, a currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 ""That should help the Canadian dollar leading into it.""
 Sutton said further support for the currency will be met at
the 200-day moving average of C$1.0479.
 BOND PRICES PLUNGE
 Canadian bonds sank across the curve, tracking U.S.
Treasury notes, as renewed risk appetite dulled the traditional
safe-haven appeal of government debt. [US/]
 The two-year government bond  dropped 33 Canadian
cents to C$99.42 to yield 1.796 percent, and the 10-year bond
 plunged C$1.03 to C$101.05 to yield 3.375 percent.
 With a rate hike still being priced in the near term,
Canadian bonds lagged U.S. treasuries at the short end of the
curve but outperformed at the long end.
 Bond prices, particularly for near-term issues, typically
fall when interest rates go up as their fixed coupon payments
seem less profitable than rising yields on other investments.
 ""Treasuries have rallied aggressively, they outperformed
Canadian bonds on the way up and now we're seeing a bit of a
reversal,"" added Mulraine.
 The Canadian 10-year bond was 2.7 basis points above the
U.S. 10-year yield, compared with 6.3 basis points above on
Wednesday.
 In new issues, Ontario sold C$600 million of debt in a
reopening of an existing 4.60 percent bond, while Quebec sold
C$500 million of debt in a reopening of an existing 5.00
percent issue. [ID:nN27266731] [ID:nN27269894]

 Thin volume conditions ahead of market holidays in Britain

the regions' debt problems, analysts said.
 ""The Portuguese debt auction yesterday went well, while the
Spanish parliament approved a 15-billion-euro austerity
package,"" said David Watt, senior currency strategist, at RBC

 ""So we're starting to see some progress in the euro zone
and things are getting done. Given that the market is

selling is overdone, and therefore the euro is due for a
bounce,"" Watt added.
 Higher-yielding, commodity currencies soared as oil prices
climbed. The Australian dollar  rose 3.5 percent

 * Paramo warns euro would not survive repeat of Greek crisis
 
(adds quotes, detail)
 By Nigel Davies and Boris Groendahl
 BARCELONA/VIENNA, May 27 (Reuters) - European Central Bank
members took differing lines on the euro's recent slump on
Thursday, with one calling the volatility unwelcome as others
cheered the drop as a tonic for the economy.
 Analysts said the divide was unlikely to help the euro,
which has slumped over 15 percent since January  on
the back of persistent fears that the debt crisis begun in
Greece was worsening across the 16-country bloc. 
 Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, one of the ECB's six-strong
Executive Board, warned that the euro zone could not afford
another country to mislead markets on the scale of its deficit
problems in the way Athens had.
 ""It's obvious that another Greece with regards a country's
statistics cannot be repeated. It is unimaginable. The euro
would not survive if there was another Greece,"" he said,
speaking in Barcelona.
 ""A currency should always reflect the fundamentals of an
economy ... sharp movements in a currency are undesirable for
growth,"" he said when asked about the euro's recent slump.
 The head of the Austrian central bank Ewald Nowotny and Bank
of France Governor Christian Noyer took a more positive view of
the decline.
 ""May I remind you that not a long time ago, there were
concerns that the appreciation of the euro would slow down the
economy. This (depreciation) is a clearly positive development,
our industry certainly won't regard it as negative,"" Nowotny
said in Vienna. 
 But he stressed that others might not be so happy about the
situation. ""We'll have to see how long this development will be
seen as acceptable by the United States,"" he said.

 Analysts said the comments did not suggest intervention was
on the cards but instead underscored a divide in euro zone which
has added to the recent market turmoil.
 ""The ECB's rhetoric is all over the place and is not doing
the euro any good,"" said Lloyds economist Kenneth Broux
 ""Saying the volatility is not welcome is fine, it's been
running through G7 and G2O statements for years. But I have an
issue with the comments that the euro will not survive another
Greek crisis. It is certainly not the kind of comment that is
going to improve confidence in the currency,"" he said.
 
 ARSENAL
 The euro hit a four-year low of $1.2143 against the dollar
last week  in reaction to the ongoing troubles.
 It rebounded above $1.225 on Thursday after Chinese
officials denied the country was distancing itself from euro
zone debt holdings and Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund rebuffed a
report it was reducing its euro zone exposure. (for story click
)
 Noyer told French TV station LCI that he had never felt any
concerns about the euro zone from China, adding that the euro
was now trading at ""more normal"" levels and benefitting
exporters. [ID:nPAB008365]
 The debt crisis forced the ECB to abandon its long-held
resistance to buying government bonds earlier this month.
 Some economists argue the ECB has now used its ultimate
crisis-fighting weapon, leaving it with little in the locker if
the troubles worsen.
 Gonzalez-Paramo countered the accusations. ""Our arsenal is
not exhausted. Our ability to act is not diminished, we will use
all instruments at our disposal,"" he said. Nowotny said the ECB
was ""well equipped"".
 Speaking to reporters, Gonzalez-Paramo warned that while the
ECB's decision to buy bonds had stabilised markets, the measures
would not rectify the euro zone's underlying problems.
 ""Markets' problems cannot all be solved by this programme
(bond buying)... Markets are perceiving high sovereign risk and
that is something that needs to be resolved at a national
level,"" he said.

 * Euro advances as China affirms FX diversification policy
 * China refutes report it's reviewing euro bond holdings
 * Bargain-hunting helps global stocks gain traction
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - Investors drove a broad rally
in the euro and pushed U.S. stock indexes up more than 2
percent on Thursday, after China's assertion that Europe will
remain a major investment market.
 The People's Bank of China said a Financial Times report
that Beijing was concerned about its euro-zone bond holdings
was groundless. The report had driven the euro to a near
four-year low on Wednesday and cut short a rally in U.S.
stocks.
 Markets charged higher as the perceived risk that China
might change the composition of its foreign exchange was
reduced.
 ""Reports from the front suggested that investors might
become frightened that China could do something drastic,"" said
Douglas Peta, an independent market strategist in New York.
""Getting some assurance that Chinese sales of European
sovereign debt isn't imminent is making everyone feel better.""
 Commodity prices rose as the dollar fell, boosted by
improving U.S. oil demand and a drop in crude stockpiles. Gold
rose slightly.
 European shares closed above the 1,000 mark for the first
time in just over a week and U.S. shares rose more than 2
percent. Government debt prices fell as the bid for safety
ebbed. Bargain hunters picked through a market that had been
beaten down by fears that Europe's debt crisis could spark a
credit crunch and undermine the global economic recovery.
 ""The market is bouncing off oversold, but I think the big
catalyst this morning is comments coming out of China that
tempered concerns about the Chinese government possibly
trimming back its $600 billion plus of euro zone bond
holdings,"" said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A.
Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, New York.
 In midday New York trade, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> rose 204.05 points, or 2.05 percent, at 10,178.50. The
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 24.66 points, or 2.31
percent, at 1,092.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
climbed 61.80 points, or 2.81 percent, at 2,257.68.
 Equity markets shrugged off a report showing the U.S.
economy grew at a slower pace than previously estimated in the
first quarter as business investment slackened.
[ID:nN27259780]
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> closed up
2.9 percent at 1,000.46 points. The index remains down around
10 percent from a mid-April peak on worries about Europe's debt
crisis.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
2.65 percent.
 A Reuters poll out Thursday showed institutional investors
held onto their equities exposure more than might have been
expected in May, given extreme volatility on financial markets,
but also put more money in safe-haven cash. [ID:nLDE64Q0FM]
 EURO GAINS
 The euro rose 1.67 percent at $1.237 while the dollar fell
against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the
U.S. dollar index <.DXY> down 1.05 percent at 86.208.
 China has been trying to diversify its currency reserves to
reduce the dollar's dominance in favor of the euro and yen to
curb risks.
 On Wednesday the euro collapsed 1.5 percent after the
Financial Times reported China's State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE) was meeting foreign bankers because of
concerns about its exposure to debt troubles in Europe.
 SAFE, the arm of the central bank, manages China's $2.4
trillion in foreign exchange reserves -- the world's largest
stockpile.
 Separately, the Kuwaiti Investment Authority on Thursday
denied a local media report that it, too, was reducing its
exposure to euro zone investments. The sovereign wealth fund
stated there was no change to its long-term investment strategy
including Europe.
 In response to the better risk appetite, safe-haven
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded 1-1/32 lower, driving
the yield up to 3.31 percent .
 Euro zone government bond futures settled 39 ticks lower at
128.33, well off the session low of 128.34 .
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $2.90, or 4.06
percent, to $74.41 per barrel, and spot gold prices  rose
$1.25, or 0.10 percent, to $1211.10.

(Updates throughout)
 PARIS, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro, which has declined
sharply in recent weeks, is now trading at a ""more normal"" level
which is good news for exports from the single currency zone,
European Central Bank board member Christian Noyer said.
 Noyer said the current level of the euro, which has fallen
on fears that a debt crisis in the euro zone could escalate, was
near the currency's long-term average.
 ""It is clear that we are currently in an area which is ...
more normal. Certainly, we are benefiting from it in terms of
exports,"" Noyer, who is also governor of the Bank of France,
told French TV station LCI.
 He added he had never felt any concerns from China over the
euro zone. On Thursday, Beijing denied a report it was looking
to cut its holdings of euro zone sovereign debt. [ID:nTOE64Q04P]
 Concerns over the euro zone have seen financial markets
oscillate wildly during the last month. Noyer said he hoped
markets would return to a calmer period and attacked
rumour-mongering, which had contributed to the volatility.
 ""I hope that we will very quickly return to a moment of
calm. People must stop believing any old rumour,"" he said.
Noyer also said France should aim to bring its public sector
debt down to 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
 ""One should target that in the long term,"" he said, adding
it was imperative for France to show investors that it had
credible measures for cutting its debt.
 France's debt rose to 77.6 percent of GDP at the end of the
fourth quarter of last year -- well above the limit of 60
percent imposed under European Union fiscal stability rules.
 Noyer added that authorities still had to work to do
concerning the regulation of financial market infrastructure.

 * Calls economy the ""wellspring of American power""
 * Obama distancing himself from ""Bush Doctrine""
(Adds Clinton, paragraph 13)
 By Matt Spetalnick
 WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on
Thursday unveiled a new national security doctrine that would
join diplomatic engagement and economic discipline with
military power to bolster America's standing in the world.
 Striking a contrast to the Bush-era emphasis on going it
alone, President Barack Obama's strategy called for expanding
partnerships beyond traditional U.S. allies to encompass rising
powers like China and India in order to share the international
burden.
 Faced with a struggling economy and record deficits, the
administration also acknowledged that boosting economic growth
and getting the U.S. fiscal house in order must be core
national security priorities.
 ""At the center of our efforts is a commitment to renew our
economy, which serves as the wellspring of American power,"" the
wide-ranging policy statement said.
 Obama's first official declaration of national security
goals, due to be released in full later on Thursday, pointedly
omitted predecessor George W. Bush's policy of pre-emptive war
that alienated some U.S. allies.
 Laying out a vision for keeping America safe as it fights
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the document formalized Obama's
intent to emphasize multilateral diplomacy over military might
as he tries to reshape the world order.
 The administration even reiterated Obama's determination to
try to engage with ""hostile nations,"" but warned
nuclear-defiant Iran and North Korea it possessed ""multiple
means"" to isolate them if they ignored international norms.
 The National Security Strategy, required by law of every
president, is often a dry reaffirmation of existing positions
but is considered important because it can influence budgets
and legislation and is closely watched internationally.
 SEEKS ""FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE PATH""
 Obama, who took office faced with the worst financial
crisis since the 1930s, took a clearer stand than any of his
predecessors in drawing the link between America's economic
health at home and its stature overseas.
 ""We must renew the foundation of America's strength,"" the
document said, asserting that the sustained economic growth
hinges on putting the country on a ""fiscally sustainable path""
and also urging reduced dependence on foreign oil sources.
 There was no discussion of what has become an emerging
consensus in foreign policy circles -- that heavy U.S.
indebtedness to countries like China poses a security problem.
 But the report did reflect Washington's enigmatic
relationship with Beijing, praising it for a more active role
in world affairs while insisting it must act responsibly. It
also reiterated unease over China's rapid military buildup.
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States'
fiscal problems presented a long-term threat to its diplomatic
clout. ""We cannot sustain this level of deficit financing and
debt without losing our influence, without being constrained
about the tough decisions we have to make,"" she said in a
speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
 Bush used his first policy statement in 2002 to stake out
the right to unilateral and pre-emptive military action against
countries and terrorist groups deemed threats to the United
States in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 Obama's plan implicitly distanced his administration from
what became known as the Bush Doctrine and underpinned the 2003
U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, which lacked U.N. authorization.
 While renewing previous presidents' commitment to preserve
U.S. conventional military superiority, the doctrine laid out
on Thursday put an official stamp on Obama's break from what
Bush's critics called ""cowboy diplomacy.""
 ""We need to be clear-eyed about the strengths and
shortcomings of international institutions,"" the document said.
But it said Washington did not have the option to ""walk away.""
 ""Instead, we must focus American engagement on
strengthening international institutions and galvanizing the
collective action that can serve common interests such as
combating violent extremism, stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons and securing nuclear materials, achieving balanced and
sustainable economic growth, and forging cooperative solutions
to the threat of climate change,"" it said.
 MESSAGE TO EMERGING POWERS
 Obama's insistence the United States cannot act alone in
the world was also a message to current and emerging powers
that they must shoulder their share of the global burden.
 Obama already has been widely credited with improving the
tone of U.S. foreign policy but still is struggling with two
unfinished wars, nuclear standoffs with Iran and North Korea
and sluggish Middle East peace efforts.
 Critics say some of his efforts at diplomatic outreach show
U.S. weakness, and they question whether he jeopardizes
American interests by relying too heavily on ""soft power.""
 Obama's strategy repeated his goal to ""disrupt, dismantle,
and defeat"" al Qaeda but insisted that in the process the
United States must uphold and promote human rights. It also
rejected torture as a tool of U.S. national security.
 Obama has reached out to the Muslim world, where the U.S.
image under Bush was hurt by the Iraq war, the Abu Ghraib
prisoner abuse scandal and his use of phrases like ""war on
terror"" and ""Islamo-fascism.""
 Curbing the threat of ""home-grown"" terrorism was also
listed as a top priority. This comes in the aftermath of the
failed Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. airliner and the botched
Times Square car bombing attempt earlier this month.

 * President Medvedev wants businesses to innovate
 * Weak demand for innovation at home
 
 (Refiles to fix typo in 'businessman', first paragraph)
 By Gleb Bryanski
 LAPPEENRANTA, Finland, May 27 (Reuters) - When Russian
businessman Dmitry Svetlov opened a joint venture producing
antiseptics in 1994, it was a St Petersburg official called
Vladimir Putin who signed the permit.
 Sixteen years on, he wants Putin, now prime minister, to
help him crack the European market.
At the first EU-Russia Innovation Forum, held this week in a
sleepy Finnish town near the Russian border, Svetlov lamented
the difficulty for Russian entrepreneurs of penetrating foreign
markets with innovative products -- something President Dmitry
Medvedev has sought to encourage.
 ""We would like to sell our products here. We are tired of
middlemen who simply want to get hold of our research,"" said
Svetlov, deserted by Finnish partners after the 1998 rouble
devaluation and now sole owner of the Soft Protector venture.
 ""We (Russians) are viewed in the West as raw material
suppliers. It is very difficult to enter the market with a
ready-made product,"" he said. 
 Medvedev wants Russian businesses to innovate as part of his
drive to make the economy less dependent on natural resources
like oil and gas, but his critics say innovation should be
driven by demand and not by orders or budget handouts. 
 Medvedev's chief of staff Sergei Naryshkin said in an
article published this week the country was becoming dangerously
dependent on foreign innovation ideas, posing the biggest threat
to national economic security. 
 Domestic demand for innovative products is wrecked by cheap
imports, while entry barriers in foreign markets are too high
for a small company like Svetlov's, operating in a country which
is not even a member of the World Trade Organisation. 
 
 ENTER THE MARKET
 Russia is already spending a fortune to address the supply
side of innovation through a giant state venture fund, Rusnano,
tasked with financing innovative businesses and headed by 1990s
privatisation architect Anatoly Chubais. 
 The country has also announced a plan to build Russia's
answer to California's Silicon Valley outside Moscow, where
officials promise to create a special zone for innovative
businesses without red tape and corruption. 
 However, Putin himself complained recently that the bulk of
state-sponsored research projects were not even formally
required to result in product patents. ""What kind of R&D
projects are these?"" he fumed at a government meeting.
 The Russian economy is dominated by a small number of giant
holdings, controlled by either the state or tycoons, which are
able to deal with bureaucracy and corruption but generate
neither innovative ideas nor demand for innovative products. 
 Putin, keen to bring Russia back on the path to growth, is
negotiating global deals to sell Russian energy resources,
nuclear reactors or weapons, but helping small businesses to
carve their niche in competitive markets will be more difficult.
""We are looking for a partner who can help us enter the
market and we are ready to share the profit because we know we
are going to get it,"" said Valery Saxon, CEO of Polyinform, a
company which cleans up oil spills using biotechnology. 
 
 TOO BUSY TO RESPOND
 Saxon says his enterprise survived the turmoil of the 1990s,
when similar high-tech firms with rights to Soviet-era
technology had collapsed, because it offered services rather
then products that can be copied. 
 The company is now working on remote diagnostics of oil
pipelines to prevent spills, and plans to install its device on
remotely controlled submersibles to detect faults in deep-sea
installations. 
 ""We wrote to BP to tell them about our research but they are
probably too busy to respond right now,"" Saxon said in reference
to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico. ""It (the leak) was the
result of poor diagnostics.""
 Vsevolod Opanasenko, CEO of Russian supercomputers maker
T-Platforms, has recently struck a deal to supply coolers for a
data centre to be built in Finland. He said 80 percent of the
market for supercomputers is controlled by U.S. companies.
 ""This is a very competitive market and no one is welcoming
us here,"" Opanasenko said. His vision is to conquer 3-5 percent
of the supercomputers market in three to five years, up from a
current stake of less than one percent.

 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro and global stock
markets surged higher on Thursday, bolstered by China's
knock-down of a report saying it was looking to cut its
holdings of euro zone sovereign debt.
 The People's Bank of China's assertion that Europe is a key
investment market for its foreign exchange reserves helped lift
the euro from near four year lows. The central bank called the
Financial Times report on Wednesday groundless.
 ""The fact that they came out with a statement today

they're not concerned. But they're looking at the euro from a
long-term perspective and the base-case scenario is that the

currency strategist, at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 Commodity prices rose as the dollar fell, with the added
benefit of improving U.S. oil demand and a drop in crude
stockpiles. Gold rose slightly.
 U.S. and European stock markets extended gains while
government debt prices fell as risk appetite favored equities.
Bargain hunters picked through the beaten-down market felled

undermine the global economic recovery.
 ""The market is bouncing off oversold, but I think the big

 * Fiscal loosening, c.bank attacks a risky mix -analysts
 * Talks with IMF/EU expected in June to bring more clarity
 
 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, May 27 (Reuters) - Hungary's incoming centre-right
government has taken a few symbolic steps to please voters since
winning April elections but has yet to present a consistent
economic plan, which is starting to unnerve investors.
 The election winner, the Fidesz party, has set economic
growth and tax cuts as its top priority and wants to reduce
public debt with the help of faster growth over time.
 It has also mounted an attack on the central bank, calling
on its governor to resign and urging lower interest rates.
 Analysts said the tensions with the central bank and planned
fiscal easing represented a risky mix, especially given
Hungary's track record of budget laxity and the fact that
investors are heavily focused on debt and deficits in Europe.
 ""While it is still early days, it is fair to say that (the)
government has got off to a disappointing start,"" said Neil
Shearing at Capital Economics in London.
 ""We are becoming increasingly concerned that it will
prioritise economic populism over much-needed fiscal
discipline. Accordingly, Hungarian bonds and the forint look set
for a rough ride over the coming months.""
 The forint has weakened about 5 percent to 277 versus the
euro from 263 the day after the April 25 vote.
 The yield on Hungary's 3-year government bonds has jumped 90
basis points to 6.30 percent since mid-April, while the yield on
5-year paper has surged over 110 basis points to 6.85 percent.
 Prime Minister-designate Viktor Orban and his new government
are due to be sworn in on Saturday. He will have to start talks
with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union soon
after, as the next quarterly review by lenders -- who committed
$25 billion to rescuing Hungary from a financing and currency
crisis in 2008 -- is due in June.
 Analysts said these talks should bring more clarity on
plans.
 
 LACK OF DETAIL
 Fidesz, which won a two-thirds parliamentary majority in
April elections, was welcomed by financial markets as investors
hope its strong mandate will prompt the new government to reform
the inefficient state sector and the healthcare and education
systems.
 But the programme put forward by Orban's government last
week lacked details on tax plans, on how it wants to offset
planned tax cuts on the expenditure side, and how it plans to
reduce the budget deficit and reverse a rise in public debt. 
 It was also thin on any reform ideas.
 Hungary's public debt, at around 80 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), is the highest in central Europe even
after tough spending cuts carried out under the scrutiny of the
IMF and EU last year which resulted in a deficit of 4 percent in
2009.
 While Hungary can finance itself from the markets now,
analysts said it will likely need a new IMF programme as the
current deal expires by October 2010 and its debt repayment
obligations will rise in 2011 and 2012.
 ""A new government may well be forced to take additional IMF
tranches in order to overcome these funding needs, especially if
the structural deficit widens anyway,"" Nomura said in a note.
 Fidesz has said it wants a new deal with lenders.
 
 RISKY PATH
 On the domestic policy front, Fidesz has set up a smaller,
more centralised government than its Socialist predecessor and
passed legislation to almost halve the size of parliament from
2014. A new law on Wednesday made it easier for ethnic
Hungarians in neighbouring states to obtain Hungarian
citizenship -- a measure that drew retaliation from Slovakia but
enjoys wide backing at home.
 ""In terms of domestic politics, Fidesz has been acting in a
realistic way: it has done a few symbolic things which were easy
and could be done,"" said political analyst Csaba Toth of think
tank Republikon Institute.
 A poll by Median on Thursday showed support for Fidesz at 50
percent among all voters against 11 percent for the outgoing
Socialists.
 But since the elections, the global environment has changed
for the worse, with investors demanding a higher premium on
riskier assets, including those in central and eastern Europe --
a fact reflected in Hungary's rising bond yields.
 The central bank is expected to halt its rate cuts on Monday
due to a negative shift in sentiment.. Analysts said Fidesz'
attacks on the independent central bank and its calls for lower
rates could upset markets.
 ""We feel that our assumption that the new government would
take market sentiment into account is being challenged,"" Morgan
Stanley analysts said in a note on May 25.
 ""Fidesz must realise they need markets onside for the
difficult shift of policy ideology they are attempting. They are
treading a very dangerous road with contagion risks piled on
top,"" Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura said.

 * Market flooded with francs after repeated SNB intervention
 * Too much liquidity raises inflation risk

 By Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, May 27 (Reuters) - Switzerland's central bank must
find a way to drain liquidity without stalling the economy after
repeated currency interventions flooded the market with Swiss
francs and pushed a key interest rate to a record low.
 With the euro pummelled by concerns about sovereign debt in
southern Europe, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) pumped nearly 29
billion Swiss francs ($25 billion) into markets in April to stem
the franc's rise.
 As a consequence, the key 3-month Swiss franc LIBOR started
to fall and hit a record low of 0.11 percent on Thursday, below
the SNB's target of 0.25 percent.
 The SNB has been aggressively fighting a rally in the Swiss
franc since the currency, a traditional safe haven, began
attracting investors during the credit crisis, and the euro
crisis has intensified this trend. Since Aug. 2008 the franc has
risen some 13 percent against the euro.
 ""They face a policy dilemma. The balance sheet is expanding
again when there is already a large stock of liquidity
domestically. But the exchange rate is too strong,"" BNP Paribas
economist Eoin O'Callaghan said.
 ""The pool of excess liquidity created by the SNB represents
a more significant threat to medium term price stability than
elsewhere in Europe,"" he said.
 Whereas money markets in the euro zone are strained, the
Swiss money market is flush with liquidity that could push the
3-month LIBOR even lower, a Zurich-based trader told Reuters.
 ""There's much too much money in the system. Interventions
are the only reason there's so many francs around,"" he said. 
 ""We could imagine the 3-month LIBOR going into single
digits.""
 The central bank has been intervening for the last 14 months
to stave off deflation risks exacerbated by a strong franc, part
of ultra-loose measures it adopted in March 2009 to fight
recession.
 But Switzerland has weathered the global economic downturn
better than other European countries and is expected to grow
about 1.5 percent this year, the SNB says.
 ""Given the shallow downturn and the strong recovery, (the
SNB's) policy stance is overly accommodative,"" O'Callaghan said.
 ""Their domestic deflation worries have receded,"" he said.
""And the market knows.""
 SNB Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan warned last week the SNB's
currency interventions may fuel inflation. But he also said
downside risks to the Swiss economy remained given the debt
crisis in the euro zone, Switzerland's main trading partner. 
 The SNB's mandate is price stability in the medium and long
term. At its most recent policy review in March it said it saw
inflation exceeding its 2 percent threshold in 2012.

 TOO MUCH LIQUIDITY
 The SNB has already begun tackling abundant Swiss franc
liquidity by suspending on May 14 its daily offer of one-week
funds via a repo.
 It has also boosted auctions of its own debt -- so called
SNB bills. It auctioned 84.3 billion francs of bills in April, a
third more than in March.
 Traders have said the SNB could consider additional means of
draining funds, such as starting to use reverse repos to take in
Swiss francs.
 ""The reverse repo option is probably the most favoured,"" one
money market trader said.
 SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said on April 30 liquidity
generated via interventions needed to be absorbed in good time,
and that the SNB had the necessary means at its disposal -- SNB
bills and even reverse repos.
 But trying to drain liquidity while fighting the franc's
rise through intervention could have the side effect of offering
people a place to park francs and would be counterproductive to
deterring speculative flows, one analyst said.
 UBS economist Reto Huenerwadel said siphoning off cash could
handicap the SNB's fight against a franc rally. He said the SNB
would likely act on liquidity only once its assessment of
Switzerland's economic prospects had become more optimistic.
 ""They would probably put these measures in place once the
time is right, i.e. when there's not too much pressure on the
Euro-Swiss any more,"" Huenerwadel said.
 Despite the SNB's interventions, the Swissie hit an all time
high of 1.3995 against the euro last week on concerns about
Europe's indebtedness.
 The SNB will next decide on interest rates on June 17. Given
the euro zone crisis, economists do not expect the bank to raise
rates as yet.
 Interest rate futures indicate the SNB may tighten policy in
in December.
 ""Via the bills the SNB can drain some liquidity short term,
but there's got to be a time when one thinks about ending it.
Too much liquidity poses the threat of inflation longer term,""
Fabian Heller of Credit Suisse said.

670,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2010 09:48AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Trade powers to push for Doha deal to boost economy," * New trade deal would be economic stimulus
 * Doha talks, launched in 2001, at an impasse
 
 (Adds David Cameron quote, trade and protectionism data)
By Jonathan Lynn
 PARIS, May 27 (Reuters) - Ministers from major trading
powers decided on Thursday to redouble efforts for a deal in the
stalled Doha round, arguing that opening up global trade would
boost the world economy without hitting budgets.
 They acknowledged the 8-1/2-year-old Doha round was at an
impasse and that serious negotiations -- away from the glare of
the media and public diplomacy -- were now needed to break the
deadlock.
 Australian Trade Minister Simon Crean said ministers meeting
in Paris had held frank discussions about the difficulties they
faced.
 ""All of the evidence points to the significance of trade and
the liberalisation agenda that facilitates trade being an
important economic stimulus -- a stimulus that does not impact
upon budgets,"" Crean told a briefing after hosting the meeting.
 ""And we will keep at it. We won't be deterred simply by the
difficulty because the outcome is too important to sustainable
economic recovery,"" he said.
 UK Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking in London, agreed.
 ""I think if the world wants a stimulus, and it's a stimulus
that would really benefit, we should be pushing much harder on
getting the Doha trade round going again,"" he told BBC radio.
 
 NOT ECONOMICALLY COMPELLING
 WTO members launched the Doha round in 2001 to free up world
commerce and help poor countries prosper through more trade.
 The outlines of a deal are clear: rich countries will remove
barriers to their food markets and cut trade-distorting farm
subsidies while developing countries, except the poorest, open
their markets to more goods and services.
 But agreeing an overall package has proven impossible so
far, with the United States arguing that big emerging economies
such as Brazil, China and India -- who are now major players in
the global economy -- should do more to facilitate a deal.
 The United States wants the emerging giants to open up their
markets more to goods -- from cars to chemicals and services to
banking and express delivery -- in return for Washington paying
farmers less to produce crops such as wheat and soybeans.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk repeated that call on
Thursday, saying the current draft package was not economically
compelling and real, substantive negotiations were now needed.
 Kirk categorically rejected the idea that the United States
should make a ""pre-payment"" to get those negotiations moving,
pointing to concessions already made by the U.S. in agriculture.
 But Kirk made it clear that the United States was ready for
further concessions once those negotiations start in order to
get a satisfactory deal.
 ""We have asked everyone to engage with us in honest, very
tough negotiations -- we'll do that,"" he told reporters.
 Ministers agreed the WTO's 153 members should now broaden
the Doha talks to look at the overall package rather than
individual sectors such as agriculture or manufactured goods.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said it was important to
make progress on trade in services and environmental goods and
on fisheries subsidies, where gaps remain wide.
 Lamy said the international trading system rules banning
protectionist tit-for-tat policies had helped to prevent an even
worse crisis. Leaders of the G20 rich and emerging countries
have also promised not to close their markets.
 But a report by independent experts, Global Trade Alert,
said governments had continued to resort to protectionism, even
though the proportion of benign trade measures was increasing.
 ""Since the first G20 crisis-related summit in November 2008,
the governments of the world have together implemented 496
beggar-thy-neighbour policy measures -- that is, more than one
for every working day,"" the report said.
 Despite the lack of progress on Doha, trade is rebounding
this year as the global economy recovers. The WTO forecasts it
will expand by 9.5 percent this year after slumping 12.2 percent
in 2009.
 The airline association IATA said air cargo -- which
accounts for about 30 percent by value of international trade --
was 25.2 percent higher in April than a year earlier.

 * China reviewing euro zone debt holdings -- FT
 * Euro sentiment negative; contagion risk remains in focus
 * U.S. durable goods orders, new home sales rise in April
(Updates prices, adds comment)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro approached a
four-year low against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday on
persistent concerns about Europe's debt woes and after news
suggesting that China was reassessing its euro zone debt
holdings.
 China is reviewing its euro zone bond holdings because of
growing concerns about gaping deficits in countries including
Greece and Portugal, the Financial Times reported on
Wednesday.
 ""China will likely move to clarify this headline in the
near future and in the process try to placate market fears of
China dumping euro bonds,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""However, the damage is done and the notion will stick,
especially in a market that still prefers to embrace euro
negative rather than positive news,"" he added.
 In late New York trading, the euro EUR=EBS> fell 1.6
percent to $1.2171, after hitting a session low of $1.2166 on
electronic trading platform EBS.
 The euro last week hit its lowest level since April 2006 at
$1.2143 on EBS and is down about 15 percent so far this year.
 The euro could re-test the key $1.2135 long-term support
level in the next few days, with a break opening the door for a
deeper slide toward $1.2125 to $1.2050, according to BNP
Paribas.
 The FT said representatives of China's State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, which manages the reserves under
the country's central bank, have been meeting with foreign
bankers in Beijing to discuss the euro zone bond holdings.
 SAFE holds an estimated $630 billion of euro-zone bonds in
its reserves, the newspaper said. The exact makeup of China's
roughly $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves is a state
secret.
 Against the yen, the euro was at 109.48 yen, near a session
low. On Tuesday, it tumbled to 108.83 yen, its lowest since
November 2001. The euro also slid to a two-week low versus
sterling.
 Concerns about tighter dollar funding, with three-month
dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month high, and poor
demand at a German debt auction also weighed on the euro,
analysts said.
 U.S. data showing a surge in durable goods orders and sales
of new homes at nearly two-year highs added to the market's
view the U.S. economy will outperform Europe.
 ""The overarching themes remain the same. The market is very
fearful of the contagion factor and the debt issue dragging on
the economy over there,"" said John Doyle, foreign exchange
strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""We're still very bearish on the euro and very hawkish on
the dollar. It does appear that the economies in the euro zone
are in a much weaker position than here in the United States,""
Doyle said.
 This week's pressure on the euro started after the Spanish
central bank took over a small savings bank over the weekend,
which raised fears of weaknesses in Europe's banking system.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said on Wednesday that
Europe has the right ideas to solve its fiscal crisis and needs
to put them into practice to calm markets.
 Geithner was in London at the start of a two-day European
visit to confer with officials about ways to shore up the world
economic recovery. He pressed for greater international
cooperation to cope with the crisis spreading through southern
Europe, which is sapping investor confidence.
 The dollar was off 0.4 percent against the yen at 89.95.
The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks the performance
of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies,
was up 0.6 percent at 87.306.

 KUWAIT, May 27 (Reuters) - Kuwait Investment Authority
(KIA), the country's sovereign wealth fund, said on Thursday it
did not plan to reduce its exposure to euro zone investments,
denying a Kuwaiti newspaper report.
""KIA denies local newspaper reports that there is a
consideration by (KIA) to reduce its investments and presence in
European countries ... as a reaction to crises that some
European countries are facing,"" KIA said in an emailed
statement.
 Citing sources familiar with the matter, Kuwaiti newspaper
Al-Anba had said on Thursday that the sovereign fund was
planning to reduce investments in the euro zone on fears another
crisis involving Portugal and Spain was lurking. 
 The paper added that KIA's economic reports ""confirmed the
escalation"" of the crisis in Greece, which could lead to new
debt problems for the two other European states.
 KIA holds a stake in Germany's Daimler  and is a
majority stakeholder in telecom firm Zain .

BlackRock  last year, and said in January it was eyeing

 In December, KIA sold its $3 billion stake in Citigroup Inc
for a profit of $1.1 billion.
 The authority said in the statement that it was a long-term
investor and there was no change to its investment strategy
including in the euro zone.
 Steffen Kern, economist at Deutsche Bank and a sovereign
wealth fund expert, said he viewed any substantial currency
restructurings by sovereign funds on the basis of recent
economic events in Europe as premature.
 ""Most sovereign wealth funds have a time frame of well
beyond 10 years in their portfolio investments. Based on that,
the current economic developments do not warrant a significant
shift,"" he said.
 Kern said portfolio diversification, particularly currency
diversification, has been a major priority for sovereign funds,
and expected it to remain a key focus going forward.
 ""I expect that they will take a prudent approach,"" he said,
adding that despite the seriousness of fiscal problems in some
euro zone countries he expected the European Union and its
member states to manage and see growth prospects back on track
in the medium- to long-term.

 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Institutional investors hung on
to their equities exposure more than might have been thought in
May, given extreme volatility on financial markets, but also put
more money in safe-haven cash, Reuters polls showed on Thursday.
 Demand for alternatives, which include gold, rose. But
perhaps surprisingly in the face of regional crisis, investors
increased exposure to euro zone equities.
 Surveys of 47 leading investment houses in the United
States, Japan, Britain and continental Europe showed an average
mixed portfolio holding 52.3 percent of its holdings in
equities.
 This compares with 52.8 percent in April, but is a
relatively small decline given that MSCI's all-country world
stock index has fallen close to 12 percent in the period between
polls.
 At the same time, they cut back slightly more on bonds -- to
34.9 percent of a portfolio compared with April's 35.5 percent
and put money into cash. Cash holdings rose to 5.1 percent from
4.7 percent.
 With the month dominated by the crisis in euro zone debt,
managers in the polls, longer-term investors were not
universally glum.
 ""We expect the global economy to gradually move to a
sustainable recovery path on improvements in employment and
capital spending, centring on the United States. The world's
share markets will likely return to an uptrend,"" said Kenichi
Kubo, senior fund manager at Tokio Marine Asset Management.
 The polls even showed relative faith in Europe, the centre
of the current crisis. Allocations within equities to the euro
zone rose to 23.2 percent from 22.2 percent a month earlier.
 Despite this, concern remained that the euro zone crisis and
the government cost-cutting needed to solve it could harm future
economic growth.
 ""I do think what's happening will result in slower growth in
Europe,"" said Steven Bleiberg, head of global asset allocation
at Legg Mason Inc.

 REGIONALLY
 U.S. fund managers held on to their high exposure to
equities. Based on 11 U.S.-based management firms surveyed
between May 18 and 26, the poll found an average of 65.2 percent
of assets in equities, unchanged from April.
 Managers also cut bond holdings to an average of 28.8
percent in May, from 29.5 percent in April, while raising cash
exposure to 2 percent, from 1.7 percent.
 Continental European investors lifted their cash holdings to
its highest in at least a year in May and cut back on bonds.
 The poll of 13 Europe-based asset management companies
showed a typical mixed portfolio holding 47.9 percent of its
assets in equities this month, up from 47.5 percent in April.
 The allocation to bonds -- which includes government bonds
and corporate debt -- fell to 38.1 percent from 39.7 percent.
Cash rose to 8.0 percent from 6.9 percent.
 Japanese fund managers slightly raised their weighting for
stocks in May from the previous month's seven-year low.
 The average share weighting among 11 institutions edged up
to 45.0 percent from 44.8 percent in April.
 The average bond weighting dropped to 48.4 percent from a
10-month high of 49.1 percent in April. The weighting for cash
rose slightly to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent.
 British fund managers continued to reduce exposure to
equities in favour of bonds.
 The survey of 12 fund managers showed allocations to
equities dropped for the third month running, falling to 50.9
percent in the average global balanced portfolio in May, from
53.5 the previous month.

deal
 * Earlier gains came on talk takeover may be abandoned
 * Sterling up 0.8 percent vs dlr, helped by easing risk
aversion
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Sterling fell back from an
eleven-month high versus the euro and a two-week high against
the dollar on Thursday as sources said Prudential was pushing
ahead with its bid for AIG's Asian business.
 The comments rebuffed earlier market talk that the UK
insurer's proposed $35.5 billion takeover may be abandoned.
 Shares in Prudential had jumped on the talk of a threat to
the deal, while sterling gained as much as two cents versus the
dollar at one point, with traders citing expectations Prudential
would need to unwind previous purchases of dollars.
 The pound remained higher on the day versus the dollar,
however. It gained in line with a rise in the euro versus the
U.S. currency after Chinese officials denied a report the
country may be distancing itself from euro zone debt holdings,
which slightly eased risk averse sentiment. 
 ""The Pru story is the main driving force behind sterling at
the moment, but it is also gaining from a tentative edge back
into risk,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
nabCapital.
 The currency shrugged off a survey showing British retail
sales suffered an unexpected hit in May, with the Confederation
of British Industry's monthly distributive trades survey's
reported sales balance tumbling to a 14-month low.
 At 1216 GMT, sterling was up 0.8 percent on the day at 1.4474
, but it was off an earlier two-week high of $1.4587, a rise of
two cents from the opening level of $1.4386. Traders earlier
cited talk of sterling buying by a UK clearer.
 On March 1, when the Pru deal was first announced, sterling
fell as much as 4-1/2 cents from its opening level, prompting a
fall below the key $1.50 level.
 
 EURO/STERLING
 Euro/sterling has fallen recently as investors switched into
the pound on the view that the UK's debt problems are less
severe and less complex than euro zone's.
 The euro was steady at 84.63 pence, just above an earlier
eleven-month low of 84.22 pence. It is on course for its biggest
weekly percentage fall against sterling since November.
 ""The euro zone government debt worries are outweighing
concerns about the UK and there is more downside for
euro/sterling, at least in the near term,"" said Geraldine
Concagh, economist at AIB Group Treasury in Dublin.
 With UK political risk out of the way after the election
earlier this month, investors have turned their attention to the
euro zone, where several countries have severe debt problems and
policymaker response has been seen as uncoordinated.
 However, nabCapital's Friend said the market ""may be getting
a little ahead of the curve"" and ignoring the headwinds facing
the UK economy, which were demonstrated by the weak CBI survey.

 By Dmitry Sergeyev and Oksana Kobzeva
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, May 27 (Reuters) - Russia's economy
and currency should weather the euro zone crisis without serious
implications and there is no need to change the structure of
reserves, Central Bank Chairman Sergei Ignatyev said.
 ""The (euro zone) problem is more political than economic,""
he said on Thursday. ""With swift coordinated actions of European
nations, the problem is fully solvable.""
 The Greek debt crisis has sent a shiver through investors
across the globe who rushed to ditch the euro for dollars and
gold.
 Ignatyev called the recent swings in the euro normal and
said no changes to the structure of the central bank's gold and
foreign exchange reserves -- the world's third largest worth
some $450 billion [ID:nMOS007572] -- have been discussed.
 ""We are conservative, we do not change the structure of
currency reserves -- at least in recent months,"" he told
reporters. ""The euro moves one way, another way -- one should
get used to it.""
 Asked whether there were any plans to sell European assets
from reserves, Ignatyev replied: ""For now, I do not feel panic.""
 As of end 2009, 2.9 percent of the central bank's assets
were held in Spanish assets and 0.4 percent in Italian ones.
 Nominally, Russia keeps the FX portion of its reserves in 47
percent U.S. dollars, 41 percent euros, 10 percent sterling and
2 percent yen. [ID:nLDE634089] It has been gradually increasing
the volume of gold, a trend Ignatyev said would likely continue.
 
 FITTING FX INTERVENTION MECHANISM
 As a result of the euro zone crisis, though, financial
markets have become jittery and prices for oil and other goods
have slumped -- affecting the Russian currency.
 The rouble is slowly recovering from an 8-1/2 month low
versus the dollar of 31.69 earlier this week, trading at 30.78
per dollar on Thursday . [ID:nLDE64Q0HQ]
 Ignatyev said the currency remains under the regulator's
control -- even if the control has softened somewhat.
 ""The exchange rate regime reflects much better the current
volatile situation on global financial and goods markets,"" he
said, adding later that exchange rate fluctuations of 2-3
percent a day are normal.
 ""The mechanism (of interventions) is very successful and
corresponds to the situation and swiftly adapts to a new
situation,"" Ignatyev said.
 The central bank keeps the rouble within a floating corridor
against a euro-dollar basket , shifting the band by 5
kopecks for each $700 million of interventions in the boundary.
In addition, it buys up to $250-300 million a day in ""planned""
interventions within the band.
 Ignatyev said interventions have totalled around $5 billion
so far this month.
 
 CONTAINING INFLATION A PRIORITY
 Ignatyev declined to comment on whether the central bank
would continue its 1-year-old monetary easing cycle -- which has
slashed the refinancing rate by 400 basis points to a historic
low of 8.00 percent -- with another cut this month.
 ""The central bank intends to follow monetary policy so as on
the one hand to stimulate the growth of bank lending and thus
economic growth, and on the other hand not allow inflation to
exceed 7 percent this year or next,"" he told a banking forum.
 He said year-on-year inflation was running at 5.7 percent as
of May 24.
 Economists and officials expect the inflation rate to
increase in the second half of 2010, with pressure from stronger
domestic demand and a traditional end-of-year increase in
federal expenditures.
 Ignatyev said inflation will also determine any need to
increase minimum reserve requirements towards the end of the
year, a move which would curb the volume of liquidity in the
banking system.

 * Geithner upbeat on prospects for global framework
 * German minister says two positions quite close
 
 By Glenn Somerville and Gernot Heller
 BERLIN, May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner said the United States and Europe broadly agreed on the
need for controls on risk taking but should ensure they do not
impede recovery.
 ""I think we all agree we want more conservative restraints
on capital and leverage,"" Geithner told a joint news conference
with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in Berlin.
 There was broad agreement on the need for controls ""on risk
taking, more conservative capital requirements, bringing
transparency and disclosure to derivatives markets, making sure
that regulators and supervisors can do their jobs in protecting
the economy from risk and these things"", Geithner said.
 But this must be designed carefully so that it ""makes the
system more stable in the future but doesn't create a risk of
financial headwinds to the recovery we are seeing happening"".
 The U.S. Treasury Secretary did not refer to his earlier
criticism of his German hosts over their unilateral move last
week to ban naked short-selling of certain assets, which spooked
financial markets and angered Germany's European Union partners.
 Schaeuble said the United States and Germany were more in
agreement on the approach to regulation than it might seem.
 ""As far as what could be done or what needs to be done with
financial market regulations, we're actually a lot closer with
our assessments than it might appear at times,"" Schaeuble said.
 ""But it's clear one also has to keep in mind that the
traditions and structures of the financial sectors in the United
States are naturally quite different than in continental
Europe,"" he said. ""And that's why not everything that goes in
the same direction can be translated one-to-one for both areas.""
 Geither said that ahead of next month's Toronto G20 summit
there had been progress on a framework for the global financial
system, meaning leaders were ""in a very good position to put in
place a much better system than we had coming into this crisis"".
 Geithner said the United States was committed ""to cover the
cost of this crisis and the cost of future crises by imposing a
fee on the largest financial institutions"" and welcomed backing
for this approach in Europe, including from Germany.
 The Treasury Secretary said global recovery and a return to
growth required ""clear commitments to restore gravity to our
fiscal positions over time"", while recognising that different
countries had ""different room for manoeuvre"".
 Geithner gave few details of his talks earlier on Thursday
and late on Wednesday with European Central Bank chief
Jean-Claude Trichet and its governing council member Axel Weber.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro and European shares
pushed higher on Thursday after China denied a report it was
looking to cut its euro zone sovereign debt holdings.
 Crude oil prices rose above $72 a barrel on the back of
advances in stock markets which bolstered positive sentiment
from data the previous day showing a surge in U.S. demand.
 The euro - pressured by persistent uncertainty about the
scale of the single currency zone's debt crisis - received badly
needed support from the Chinese central bank, which said Europe
remained a key investment market for its foreign exchange
reserves.
 Traders said a report stating Kuwait was mulling reducing
investments in the euro zone later knocked the euro off its
highs.
 The euro had shed 1.5 percent after the Financial Times
reported China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)
was meeting foreign bankers because of concerns about its
exposure to debt troubles in Europe.
 That report was groundless, said SAFE, the arm of the
central bank that manages China's $2.4 trillion in foreign
exchange reserves -- the world's largest stockpile.
 ""The China comments downplaying the alleged change in
diversification policy are reassuring on the surface and that
has helped the euro rise,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at
BTM-UFJ.
 ""But it comes down to actions rather than words and if the
European debt crisis keeps rising, there will be less attraction
for China to diversify from dollars into euros,"" he said.
 The euro extended gains against the dollar to a session high
at $1.2342, up 1.4 percent on the day after the Chinese
comments. By 1115 GMT, the euro was up 1.0 percent at $1.2279.
 China has been trying to diversify its currency reserves to
reduce the dollar's dominance in favour of the euro and yen to
curb risks.
 
 BARGAIN-HUNTING BOOSTS STOCKS
 The MSCI index of world stocks rose 1 percent as investors
picked up shares beaten down in a sell-off fuelled by fears
Europe's debt crisis could spark a credit crunch and undermine
the global economic recovery.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose over 2 percent
to a one-week high of 994.92. The index remains down around 11
percent from a mid-April peak, on worries about Europe's debt
crisis.
 Attractive stock valuations and technically oversold
conditions prompted selective buying in Asia, but investors are
treading cautiously amid persistent concerns over the economic
fallout from the euro zone's debt woes.
 ""There's still a general reflection that equity markets have
become pretty oversold during the last couple of weeks. Global
economic numbers all look good still and... it's a good day for
the bargain hunters,"" said Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at
Williams de Broe.
 A Reuters poll released on Thursday showed big investors
kept relative faith with Europe despite the debt crisis, with
allocations within equities to the euro zone rising to 23.2
percent in May from 22.3 percent a month earlier.
 A rise in U.S. stock futures provided an additional boost.
S&P futures climbed 2.4 percent, with some in the market saying
they thought U.S. shares were due a technical rebound.
 U.S. Treasuries and euro zone government bond prices
retreated as the rally in equities cut bids for fixed income
assets.
 Gold ticked higher on safe-haven buying.
 Spot gold was at $1,214.15 an ounce by 1130 GMT from
1.209.90 late in New York on Wednesday. The metal hit a record
high of $1,248.95 in mid-May.

 (Adds quote, detail, updates prices)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday after
Chinese officials denied a report that Beijing may distance
itself from bond holdings from the euro zone, which has been
afflicted by debt problems in Greece and other countries.
 China said Europe remains a key investment market for its
massive currency reserves. This helped the euro recover losses
suffered on Wednesday, when the Financial Times reported that
Beijing was reviewing its euro zone debt holdings.
 Analysts said comments from China's government and central
banks knocking down the report provided an opportunity for
investors to cover short positions in the euro, which has taken
a beating on concerns about the euro zone debt crisis.
 But they added that worries about how global growth may be
impacted by deficits in the euro zone and belt-tightening
efforts to reduce them would keep investors wary about holding
risky assets, and would keep the euro under selling pressure.
""The China comments downplaying the alleged change in
diversification policy are reassuring on the surface and that
has helped the euro rise,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at
BTM-UFJ.
 ""But it comes down to actions rather than words and if the
European debt crisis keeps rising, there will be less attraction
for China to diversify from dollars into euros,"" he said.
 At 1118 GMT, the euro traded 1 percent higher on the day at
$1.2285, having climbed as high as $1.2342. Traders said short
covering in thin conditions ahead of market holidays in Britain
and the United States on Monday had exacerbated moves.
 A 2 percent rise in European shares due to a short-covering
rally helped to support the euro as higher-risk currencies
rallied as equity and commodity pries climbed.
 The euro rallied 1.8 percent against the yen to 111.15 yen,
pulling away from an 8-1/2 year low of 108.83 yen hit this week
as gains in risky assets stung the low-yielding yen. The dollar
rose 0.7 percent to 90.50 yen.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar rose more than 2 percent
against its U.S. counterpart and 3 percent versus the yen.
SPAIN AUSTERITY MEASURES
 The euro offered little reaction to the Spanish parliament's
approval of a 15 billion euro austerity package on Thursday.
Analysts said this was due to doubts about whether Spain will be
able to implement the measures.
 ""(The lack of reaction) displays deep-seated scepticism
about whether a country like Spain can really stomach further
austerity,"" said Jane Foley, research director at Forex.com.
 She added that Spain's moves to rein in its budget did not
chase away worries about the potential threat of debt problems.
She said that while short covering was supporting the single
currency at the moment, more losses were in store.
 The euro managed to hold above last week's four-year trough
of $1.2143 as well as support near $1.2135, which is roughly a
50 percent retracement of its rally from a record trough near
$0.8225 to its all-time peak of $1.6040.
 China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange said there
was ""no basis in fact"" of a Financial Times report on Wednesday
that Beijing was reviewing its euro zone debt holdings because
of growing concerns about gaping deficits in countries including
Greece and Portugal.
 The denial comes as market participants speculate that China
may be getting nervous about Europe's economic outlook, and that
it may be wary about increasing its euro zone debt holdings.
 Traders said a report Kuwait was mulling reducing euro zone
investments also highlighted the possibility that other
countries may shy away from euro zone assets.

* Nippon Life says no change in investment plan despite euro
* Nippon Life lowers average unhedged euro buying level 10 yen
 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Japan's top life insurers have kept
their hedged euro-denominated debt holdings steady and said they
had been happy to see a rally in some major euro debt markets due
to a rush of safe-haven buying amid the deepening debt crisis in
Europe.
 Nippon Life, the country's biggest insurer, said it was not
considering changing its investment plan at this point, adding
that it was actively managing the forex risk its unhedged euro
bond holdings face after the flare-up in market volatility which
sent the yen soaring against the euro this month.
 Just a month ago, when Japan's new financial year started,
some life insurers were planning to increase foreign bond
holdings without currency hedging due to the prospect of rising
interest rates in the United States and rising hedging costs.
 But now many of Japan's nine biggest insurers have tip-toed
back to the investment strategies they took last year when they
boosted their currency-hedged foreign bond holdings. The
escalation of the euro zone's debt jitters has revived the view
that central banks in major economies such as the Federal Reserve
will keep policy interest rates low.
 ""We had about 260 billion yen of hedged euro-denominated
bonds at the end of last fiscal year. They are not only hedged
against currency risk, but rather producing unrealised profits as
bond prices rise sharply,"" said Toshihiko Yamashita, general
manager of investment planning at Meiji Yasuda Life, Japan's
third largest life insurer with 24 trillion yen in assets.
 Yamashita said at the insurer's news conference on its
earnings that the company had not bought any new unhedged euro
bonds since it sold all such debt in the fiscal year that ended
in March.
 Japan's No.4 insurer Sumitomo Life said it owned German,
French and Belgian bonds, making up 90 percent of its roughly 1
trillion yen of hedged euro-denominated bond holdings. Recent
gains in those bonds have benefited its portfolio.
 Japan's nine biggest insurers held a total of $1.6 trillion
in assets as of September 2009 -- about the size of Brazil's
economy -- and around 10 percent of that was invested in foreign
bonds including euro-denominated debt.
 Their investment moves are followed closely by market players
because they can influence financial markets.
 MANAGING UNHEDGED EURO BONDS
 Still, the yen's 10 percent jump against the euro this month
was scary enough to prompt some of the top insurers holding
unhedged euro bond holdings to actively trade to reduce the forex
risk to their portfolios.
 No.1 Nippon Life said it had kept its holdings of unhedged
euro bonds flat but was controlling the forex risk by lowering
the average euro/yen rate of its unhedged euro debt buying by 10
yen from the level at the end of March.
 ""We are improving our portfolio so that it can withstand
price volatility,"" said Yosuke Matsunaga, general manager of
finance and investment planning at Nippon Life.
 But it declined to give the current average euro/yen rate of
its unhedged euro bond holdings.
 Market experts said Japanese life insurers cut unhedged
overseas debt holdings and buy them back on dips in order to
lower the average currency rate of their debt buying.
 This should enable them to avoid a situation in which they
are forced to sell unhedged overseas bonds just before the fiscal
year-end in March the following year.
 They need to report unrealised losses on unhedged foreign
bond holdings at the year-end if the yen rises 15 percent from
the level at which they originally bought the bonds.
 For example, a company that bought unhedged euro bonds at 130
yen would have to report losses if the euro fell below 110.50 yen
at the fiscal year-end.
 It can avoid this by lowering the average purchase level of
the debt to 125 yen, which would shift the threshold for the 15
percent rule to 106.25 yen.
 The euro stood at 111.05 yen on Thursday after sliding as low
as 108.83 yen this week, its lowest since November 2001. That
compares with around 130 yen a year ago.

 * China to build 6 million units of social housing
 * Dollar strength, U.S. housing to undermine copper
 
 By Pratima Desai and Humeyra Pamuk
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Damage to copper demand from
Europe's debt crisis is likely to hurt prices of the metal, but
that could be a buying opportunity because the market is tight
and consumption in top consumer China is still strong.
 But some think a weak U.S. housing market and a prolonged
period of turmoil in Europe could wreck longer-term prospects
for the metal used widely in power and construction.
 The short-term worry for investors is that Europe's debt
problems, triggered by Greece, could create a global liquidity
crisis similar to that seen after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in 2008, with knock-on effects for economic growth.
 ""With Greece and things like that there is potential for
more downside ... But beyond three months through to the end of
the year we could easily see $7,500,"" said Michael Banks,
analyst at fund manager Hermes Commodities.
 ""China is planning to build 6 million units of social
housing, that will continue to sustain copper demand even in the
face of rate hikes and policy tightening,"" Banks said.
 Hermes Commodities does not rule out copper rising to a
record high later this year.
 Perceptions of stagnant Chinese demand combined with
European chaos last week helped push the copper price down to
$6,415 a tonne -- a fall of nearly 20 percent since the year
high above $8,000 a tonne seen mid-April.
 The metal hit a record high of $8,940 a tonne on July 2,
2008. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange was trading
at around $6,900 a tonne on Thursday.
 
 EURO/DOLLAR PARITY?
 Credit downgrades for Greece, Spain and Portugal and worries
about sovereign default have hit the euro, which is hovering
near recent four-year lows.
 ""Most of the smart money we speak to says the euro could
very easily go below $1.20,"" said Randy North, a base metals
trader at RBC Capital Markets. ""If that happens, you'll probably
see base metals testing the lows they hit last week.""
 A stronger U.S. currency makes commodities priced in dollars
more expensive for holders of other currencies.
 Some expect to see the single currency at parity against the
dollar within the next year.
 ""I wouldn't be surprised to see the copper price with a '5'
in front of it, but it won't stay there for too long,"" said
Robin Bhar, analyst at Credit Agricole, adding that robust
Chinese demand over coming years would underpin copper prices.
 China is said to account for between 30 and 40 percent of
global consumption estimated at around 19 million tonnes this
year.
 Moves by China to slow growth and rein in price pressures
have spooked the market, one reason why Chinese imports of
refined copper fell in April.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ""Inflation concerns have seen China impose restrictions on
bank lending. We are trading copper tactically from the short
side,"" said John Brynjolfsson, chief investment officer at fund
manager Armored Wolf.
 ""Housing in the developed world is going to be flat on its
back for some years, if not decades ... There is speculation
that consumer spending in the U.S. has been driven by homeowners
spending their mortgage payments.""
 That could mean a rise in the rate of repossessions in the
United States, the world's largest economy and second-largest
copper consumer, despite recent data showing signs of economic
stabilisation, perhaps even recovery.
 However, others are more confident that when the market is
freer of speculators, robust fundamentals will be more obvious.
 Looking at the open interest on copper contracts -- down at
around 270,000 lots or 6.76 million tonnes from about 290,000
lots or 7.23 million tonnes in the middle of April -- that
awareness could come sooner rather than later.

""Sometimes price discovery is overweighed by speculative
activity,"" said Shawn Hackett, president of U.S.-based Hackett
Financial Advisors. ""We are probably getting to an area where
supply/demand factors are going to be price supportive.""
 One of those factors is stocks of copper, which in LME
warehouses are down 15 percent since the middle of February to
below 480,000 tonnes.
 ""We will again see large stock drawdowns. The market will
move into deficit in the second half of the year,"" Bhar said.

 ROME, May 27 (Reuters) - Italy's employers lobby
Confindustria on Thursday backed the government's 24-billion
euro austerity plan but said the budget cuts should have been
achieved through more structural measures.
 Speaking at Confindustria's annual meeting in Rome,
president Emma Marcegaglia said the budget, which has already
led Italy's largest trade union to announce national strike
action, should have gone further in reining in spending.
 ""We give full support to the policy of rigour of the economy
minister and approved by the cabinet on Tuesday, but there is a
lack of structural measures that affect the way public spending
is generated, we need reforms to boost growth,"" she said.
 ""Putting public accounts in order is not enough, and it's
not permanent either without deep structural reforms.""
 The budget includes a freeze on state salaries for four
years, cuts back on public sector hiring and delays retirement
for a few months for people due to take their pension in 2011.
 The plan aims to lower the budget deficit to 2.7 percent of
national output in 2012 from 5.3 percent last year.
 Market analysts have been broadly positive about the plan
although there is concern that some of the measures are
temporary rather than more permanent, structural changes.
 Marcegaglia said Italy needed legislation to permanently
increase the average retirement age, currently around 61, and
reduce spending on the health service in order to free up
resources for tax cuts.
 She also called for more stringent cuts to Italy's bloated
political apparatus which, she said, employs far too many people
and wastes money in the various layers of central and local
government.
 ""We have to say it clearly: politics employs too many people
in Italy, and it's the only sector that never suffers crises or
lay-offs,"" she said.
 Italy's economic recovery this year from its worst post-war
recession remained fragile and was threatened by the debt crisis
in Europe, Marcegaglia warned.
 At the same time the weakening of the euro's value ""helps
our exports and supports the weak recovery, but the lack of
confidence that lies behind it could limit the benefits.""

 * Will buy back up to 10 million shares over two years
 * Shares down, lag sector index
 
 (Adds details from conference call, shares, analyst comment)
 By Silke Koltrowitz
 ZURICH, May 27 (Reuters) - Cartier maker Richemont warned on
Thursday that Europe's uncertain economic prospects could hit
demand for expensive watches and jewellery despite recent signs
the luxury goods sector was starting to recover.
""What is going on in the western world is not very
encouraging, look at Europe and what may happen in the U.S. as
well,"" Deputy Chief Executive Officer Richard Lepeu told
journalists on a conference call after the group posted a
disappointing annual profit.
 ""The only piece of good news is Asia-Pacific that continues
to boom,"" Lepeu said.
 The Swiss luxury goods maker, the world's second largest
behind LVMH, posted 603 million euros ($739 million), in annual
profit from continuing operations, down 18 percent hit by
currency losses.
 Its shares were down 1.04 percent as of 0948 GMT, lagging a
rise in the European sector index as traders digested its
lower-than-expected profit.
 Sales down 4 percent to 5.18 billion euros in the year to
March beat expectations.
 Lepeu's comments echoed those of other executives in a
luxury goods sector grappling to recover from its deepest slump
in decades.
 Hermes has said its growth rate is likely to slow during the
year while British group Burberry is banking on momentum for its
brand to shield it from economic uncertainty.
 Richemont, which makes Cartier jewellery and IWC watches,
gave investors some encouraging news as it announced a new share
buyback programme.
 The group, which is controlled by South Africa's Rupert
family, said it would pay a dividend of 0.35 Swiss francs -- up
17 percent. It also reported that shops were replenishing stocks
after cutting back during the economic crisis, lifting sales 24
percent in April.
 
 CASH IS A FORTRESS
 Richemont more than doubled its net cash position to 1.9
billion euros at the end of March and its share buyback
programme amounted to around 380 million euros, leaving the
group enough firepower to go for buys.
 ""Having cash is more important than ever in these times. It
gives you the opportunity to have a long time view,"" Lepeu said.
 ""It also allows us to seize opportunities: Cash is a
fortress and we intend to keep it that way and wait for
opportunities.""
 Speculation has swirled that Richemont was targeting Italian
fashion house Prada and analysts expect acquisitions to pick up
in the luxury goods sector thanks in part to the euro's
weakness.
 Earlier this year, Richemont said it was looking to buy the
67 percent of UK online fashion retailer Net-a-Porter it did not
already own in a move that boosted its position in luxury
internet shopping.
 Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said the long-term prospects for
Richemont were good and the group was on track to post
stronger-than-expected sales and margin recovery in the next
couple of years.
 ""High, fast-growing EM (emerging markets) exposure; a
unique, high-end brand portfolio; increased capital and cost
discipline; strong balance sheet and cashflow generation:
Richemont captures the attributes of a good, long-term growth
story,"" he said.
 Richemont's shares trade at 14.7 times expected March 2012
earnings, according to Reuters data, against 15.8 times
estimated 2011 earnings for LVMH and 28.8 times for Hermes.

 WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on

economy, which serves as the wellspring of American power,"" the
wide-ranging policy statement said.
 Obama's first official declaration of national security
goals, due to be released in full later on Thursday, pointedly
omitted predecessor George W. Bush's policy of pre-emptive war
that alienated some U.S. allies.
 Laying out a vision for keeping America safe as it fights
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the document formalized Obama's
intent to emphasize multilateral diplomacy over military might
as he tries to reshape the world order.
 The administration even reiterated Obama's determination to
try to engage with ""hostile nations"" -- a veiled reference to
nuclear-defiant Iran and North Korea -- but threatened to
isolate them if they continued to defy international norms.
 The National Security Strategy, required by law of every
president, is often a dry reaffirmation of existing positions
but is considered important because it can influence budgets
and legislation and is closely watched internationally.
 SEEKS ""FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE PATH""
 Obama, who took office faced with the worst financial
crisis since the 1930s, took a clearer stand than any of his
predecessors in drawing the link between America's economic
health at home and its stature overseas.
""We must renew the foundation of America's strength,"" the
document said, asserting that the sustained economic growth
hinges on putting the country on a ""fiscally sustainable path""
and also urging reduced dependence on foreign oil sources.
 There was no mention of what has become an emerging
consensus in foreign policy circles -- that heavy U.S.
indebtedness to countries like China poses a national security
problem.
 Bush used his first policy statement in 2002 to stake out
the right to unilateral and pre-emptive military action against
countries and terrorist groups deemed threats to the United
States in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 Obama's plan implicitly distanced his administration from
what became known as the Bush Doctrine and underpinned the 2003
U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
 While renewing previous presidents' commitment to preserve
U.S. conventional military superiority, the doctrine laid out
on Thursday put an official stamp on Obama's departure from
what Bush's critics called ""cowboy diplomacy.""
 ""We need to be clear-eyed about the strengths and
shortcomings of international institutions,"" the document said.
But it insisted the United States did not have the option to
""walk away.""
 ""Instead, we must focus American engagement on
strengthening international institutions and galvanizing the
collective action that can serve common interests such as
combating violent extremism, stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons and securing nuclear materials, achieving balanced and
sustainable economic growth, and forging cooperative solutions
to the threat of climate change,"" it said.
 MESSAGE TO EMERGING POWERS
 Obama's insistence the United States cannot act alone in
the world was also a message to current and emerging powers
that they must shoulder their share of the burden.
 Obama already has been widely credited with improving the
tone of U.S. foreign policy -- an achievement noted when he won
the Nobel Peace Price in 2009 -- but still is struggling with
two unfinished wars, nuclear standoffs with Iran and North
Korea and sluggish Middle East peace efforts.
 Critics say some of his efforts at diplomatic outreach show
U.S. weakness, and they question whether he jeopardizes
American interests by relying too heavily on ""soft power.""
 Obama's strategy repeated his goal to ""disrupt, dismantle,
and defeat"" al Qaeda but insisted that in the process the
United States must uphold and promote human rights. It also
rejected torture as a tool of U.S. national security.
 Obama has reached out to the Muslim world, where the U.S.
image under Bush was hurt by the Iraq war, the Abu Ghraib
prisoner abuse scandal and his use of phrases like ""war on
terror"" and ""Islamo-fascism.""
 Curbing the threat of ""home-grown"" terrorism was also
listed as a top priority. This comes in the aftermath of the
failed Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. airliner and the botched
Times Square carbomb attempt earlier this month.

(Adds quote from fund manager)
 By Akiko Takeda
 TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers slightly
raised their weighting for stocks in May from the previous
month's seven-year low on the view that recent market pessimism
over Europe's debt woes is overblown, a Reuters survey showed.
 But some fund managers are nervous about market volatility
and fret that further fallout from the European debt crisis could
infect the global economy.
 ""Market players have recently sold the euro on almost any
excuse, including Germany's ban on naked short-selling. To me,
these reactions smack of typical overshooting,"" said Yoshinori
Nagano, senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.
 The average share weighting edged up to 45.0 percent in May
from 44.8 percent in April, which was a seven-year low.
 ""We expect the global economy to gradually move to a
sustainable recovery path on improvements in employment and
capital spending, centring on the United States. The world's
share markets will likely return to an uptrend,"" said Kenichi
Kubo, senior fund manager at Tokio Marine Asset Management.
 The average bond weighting dropped to 48.4 percent from a
10-month high of 49.1 percent in April, according to the poll of
11 fund managers taken from May 13-21. The weighting for cash
rose slightly to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent.
 During the survey period, global share prices plunged on
concerns that Europe's deepening debt crisis might derail a
global economic recovery.
 The U.S. Standard and Poor's Index has fallen nearly 10
percent so far this month, while Japan's Nikkei share average has
dropped more than 13 percent.
 The massive fall in share prices has made some fund managers
cautious.
 ""We are reducing risk assets, considering Europe's debt
problems and their impact on the global economy. We are also
increasing our short positions on the euro to prepare for further
deterioration in Europe's fiscal woes,"" said a fund manager who
declined to be identified because of company policy.
 But others were more bullish on the global economic outlook.
 ""At first, the EU wasn't so united in supporting bailout
schemes but their political determination is getting strong,
reducing the risk of full-scale global financial crisis,"" said
Yuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Life.
 ""Financial markets may be too pessimistic about the European
situation.""
 Fund managers increased their weightings on euro zone shares
within their equity portfolio to 12.1 percent from 10.4 percent.
 Meiji Yasuda's Kodama said the German economy is gaining
strength and is expected to benefit further from the recent fall
in the euro.
 On the other hand, the weighting for U.S. and Canada dropped
to a 5-½ year low of 42.0 percent from 43.6 percent in April,
while that for the UK slipped to a six-year trough of 6.4 percent
from 6.6 percent.
 Within bond portfolios, the weighting for North American
bonds dropped to match a record low of 25.9 percent hit in
February, compared with 26.5 percent in April.
 The weighting for euro zone bonds increased slightly to 32.2
percent from 32.0 percent. Japanese investors mostly invest in
major euro zone nation bonds, such as German debt, and have
limited exposure to southern European sovereign bonds.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded from near
four-year lows against the dollar and European shares rose on
Thursday after China denied a report it was reviewing its
investments in euro zone debt.
 U.S. crude oil futures  rose $1 to $72.51 a barrel as
stock markets pushed higher, bolstering the positive sentiment
from data showing a surge in U.S. demand.
 The ailing euro received badly needed support from the
Chinese central bank which said Europe remained a key investment
market for its foreign exchange reserves. [ID:nTOE64Q04P]
 The euro had shed 1.5 percent after the Financial Times
reported that China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange
(SAFE) was meeting foreign bankers because of concerns about its
exposure to debt troubles in Europe.
 That report was groundless, said SAFE, the arm of the
central bank that manages China's $2.4 trillion in foreign
exchange reserves, the world's largest stockpile.
 ""The China comments downplaying the alleged change in
diversification policy are reassuring on the surface and that
has helped the euro rise,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at
BTM-UFJ.
 ""But it comes down to actions rather than words and if the
European debt crisis keeps rising, there will be less attraction
for China to diversify from dollars into euros,"" he said.
 The euro extended gains against the dollar to a session high
at $1.2342 , up 1.4 percent on the day after the Chinese
comments. By 0750 GMT, the euro was up 1.1 percent at $1.2289.
 China has been trying to diversify its currency reserves,
the world's largest that have topped $2.4 trillion, to reduce
the dollar's dominance in favour of the euro and yen to curb
risks.
 
 BARGAIN-HUNTING BOOSTS STOCKS
 The MSCI index of world stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.8
percent as investors picked up shares beaten down in recent
sessions in a sell-off fuelled by fears Europe's debt crisis
could spark a credit crunch and undermine global economic
recovery.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.8
percent, adding to the previous session's rise and tracking
gains in Japan. The index is still down more than 12 percent
from a mid-April peak, on worries about Europe's debt crisis.
 The FT report had fed broad risk aversion and hit U.S.
stocks on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
closing below 10,000 for the first time since early February.
 ""It's mostly a reaction to oversold conditions. Equities are
cheap in most places, other than in the worst affected regions,""
said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB
Stockbrokers, in Dublin.
 Attractive stock valuations and technically oversold
conditions after a recent selloff prompted selective buying in
Asia, but investors tread cautiously amid persistent concerns
over the economic fallout from the euro-zone's debt woes.
 A rise in U.S. stock futures provided an additional boost.
S&P futures  climbed 1.7 percent, with some in the market
saying they thought U.S. shares were due a technical rebound.
 Gold ticked higher as persistent worry about Europe's debt
crisis attracted buying from investors trying to avoid risk.
 Spot gold  gained 0.4 percent to $1,214.45 an ounce.
Gold hit a record high of $1,248.95 in mid-May as investors
ditched the euro on fears that euro zone austerity policies
could undermine the global economic recovery.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Thursday, buoyed
by short covering ahead of a long weekend and after Chinese
officials denied a report that the country may be distancing
itself from euro zone debt holdings.
 The euro first rebounded sharply after nearing last week's
four-year low earlier in the day, gaining steam as bargain
hunting in equity markets gave a broad lift to yen crosses.
 It then extended gains after a government official told
Reuters that China remains committed to its long-standing goal
of diversifying its foreign exchange reserves.
 Separately, the head of China's $300 billion sovereign
wealth fund, China Investment Corp, told Xinhua news agency in
an interview that the Greek debt crisis would not have a big
impact on China's overseas investments.
 China will continue to follow a principle of diversification
in investing its foreign exchange reserves, and Europe will
remain one of its key investment markets, the People's Bank of
China said in a statement on its website (www.pbc.gov.cn).
 ""The China comments downplaying the alleged change in
diversification policy are reassuring on the surface and that
has helped the euro rise,"" said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at
BTM-UFJ.
 ""But it comes down to actions rather than words and if the
European debt crisis keeps rising, there will be less attraction
for China to diversify from dollars into euros,"" he said. 
 The euro, battered by Europe's debt crisis, had come under
more pressure after the Financial Times reported on Wednesday
that China was reviewing its euro zone debt holdings because of
growing concerns about gaping deficits in countries including
Greece and Portugal.
 
 YEN SOLD AS EQUITIES RISE
 At 0730 GMT, the euro was trading up around 1 percent on the
day at $1.2305. Traders said short-covering in thin conditions
ahead of market holidays had exacerbated moves.
""Singapore is on holiday tomorrow and some overseas markets
will be closed on Monday, so this may be short-covering ahead of
a long weekend,"" said a trader at a Japanese brokerage. 
 The euro's rise took it up from its intraday low of $1.2154
on trading platform EBS.
 The euro managed to hold above last week's four-year trough
of $1.2143 as well as support near $1.2135, which is roughly a
50 percent retracement of its rally from a record trough near
$0.8225 to its all-time peak of $1.6040.
 The euro rallied 1.8 percent against the yen to 111.25 yen,
pulling away from an 8-1/2 year low of 108.83 yen hit on trading
platform EBS on Tuesday.
 A sharp rise in Asian equities and a positive open for
European stocks fuelled selling of the low-yielding Japanese
currency and buying of higher-yielders such as the Australian
dollar.
 ""There appears to be some bargain hunting going on for
riskier assets after a period of risk aversion over recent
weeks,"" said BTM-UFJ's Hardman.
 The Australian dollar rose 1.8 percent to 0.8362 and made
strong gains versus the yen, rallying over 2 percent to 75.50
yen.
 Speculation that the launch of an overseas investment fund
in Japan on Friday may attract solid demand from Japanese retail
investors helped weigh on the yen.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent against the yen to 90.35 yen,
but was broadly weaker versus a currency basket as investors
sold the greenback on reduced safe-haven demand.

 As the economic climate has dented rich-world political
power, some sovereign wealth funds themselves are sounding more
confident about their need for discretion.
 ""SWFs are not publicly traded companies. We do not have
obligations to publish quarterly information to the public,"" Jin
Liqun, chairman of the board of supervisors at China Investment
Corp, told Reuters in October.
 ""Indeed, this kind of quarterly disclosure has done more
harm than good. It has encouraged managers to do reckless

 As sovereign wealth funds strengthen their south-south
partnerships, this could also feed into a more closed-door
culture in broad financial markets, which are already jumpy
after a series of shocks.
 ""South-south investing would not necessarily improve
transparency much more due to the nature of the parties
involved,"" said Efraim Chalamish, who advises various sovereign
funds and is a global fellow at New York University Law School.
 ""Some south-south investing is driven by strategic
alliances, which again raises the concern of combining politics
and commerce -- how much of these investments are driven by
politics and other non-commercial motives?""
 Just as in the 17th century it was European corporations
that laid the grounds of modern global finance, today the
sovereign wealth funds are driving the world towards a new
financial order.

 * Growth 'could rival United Arab Emirates' 
 * Unpredictable rule makes some investors wary 
 * Muammar Gaddafi's sons competing for influence 
 
 By Christian Lowe
 SIRTE, Libya, May 27 (Reuters) - At the marina under
construction so yachts can moor off Muammar Gaddafi's hometown,
the floodlights are switched on even though the mid-morning sun
is beating down.
 Lights are often left on through the day at Libya's
airports, along roads and on construction sites, because this is
a country with money to burn: it has about $150 billion in
foreign reserves, or $24,000 for every citizen.
 Libya is using the cash pile it built up from exporting oil
and gas to fund a frenzy of economic development. Foreign
businessmen are rushing in to the boom, which is undimmed by the
slowdown affecting the rest of the world.
 But there is a catch.
 Libya may have stopped being an international pariah,
renounced banned weapons programmes and dropped the brand of
Socialism set out in the ""Green Book"" written by its leader
Gaddafi, but it can still be volatile and unpredictable.
 It has few clear rules and, analysts say, decision-making
often depends on which of Gaddafi's children is in favour: the
reform-minded Saif al-Islam, his brother Mutassim, who has ties
to the old guard, or one of six other siblings.
 A protracted diplomatic row between Libya and Switzerland
was a case in point. It began with the brief 2008 arrest of
another Gaddafi son, Hannibal, in a luxury hotel in Geneva and
led to Libya threatening U.S. business interests and -- until
late March -- withholding visas from most European citizens.
 ""Libya might have had a point in its row with Switzerland,""
said Mustafa Fetouri, a Libyan political analyst and professor.
But its actions ""made every single potential (foreign investor)
ask twice about the wisdom of any investment decision"".

 BOOM TOWN
 In the Libyan capital Tripoli, 500 km (310 miles) west of
Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte, few of the people in the newly
opened Radisson Blu hotel seemed concerned.
 In the lobby, a European businessman negotiated one deal
after another on his mobile phone. Nearby, visiting executives
from a U.S. bank handed out their business cards.
 These days, it is a typical Tripoli scene. ""If you go into a
cafe in the morning you'll see people signing contracts,"" said a
Libyan who returned home after living in the United States.
""This town is booming.""
 British retailers Marks & Spencer and Monsoon have opened
stores in the city, a 5-star Marriott hotel will open next year
and migrant workers from south east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa
rush to finish shiny new office blocks. 
 It is not all chic. One weekday afternoon at the Tripoli
stock exchange -- where Libya's two mobile phone firms are
expected to float shares this year -- an old woman with carpet
slippers on her feet took a rest on the front steps.
 While there are few signs of extreme poverty in Libya --
gross domestic product per head is five times higher than in
neighbouring Egypt -- there is plenty of neglect.
 In Tripoli's historic old city, the medina, the walls of
some of the houses have collapsed and residents use the exposed
rooms to dump their rubbish.
 Still, Libya is a country on the move.
 Its economy will grow 5.4 percent in 2010, according to the
International Monetary Fund. United Nations figures show foreign
direct investment into Libya rose to $4.1 billion in 2008 from
$1.038 billion in 2005.
 The government says it has earmarked $150 billion for
spending on infrastructure, though the timetable for that is not
clear, and is inviting foreign firms to bid for contracts.
 ""Most people would agree that it's high time Libya took back
its place in the international market,"" said Pervez Akhtar, a
partner with law firm Allen & Overy.
 ""There's no reason why it shouldn't be at the same level as,
for example, UAE (the United Arab Emirates),"" he said.
 At an investment conference in Tripoli, Trade Minister
Mohamed Hweji made his pitch. ""The Libyan environment provides
you with security and economic stability,"" he told delegates.
""This is a very good time to make investments in Libya.""

 UNPREDICTABILITY
 That same conference also demonstrated the risks of
investing in this country of 6.3 million people, most of it
covered by desert. 
 The event opened three days after Tripoli lifted the ban on
issuing visas to most Europeans: as a result, only one employee
with the European conference organiser managed to get into the
country in time. Organisers had to ask a Tripoli-based diplomat
to step in and help hand out delegates' name badges.
 There are other examples of Libya's unpredictability.
 Max Goeldi, the head of Libyan operations for Swiss
engineering firm ABB has been barred from leaving Libya since
soon after Hannibal Gaddafi's arrest. He is now in jail. Libyan
officials deny any link between the two cases.
 In a separate case, a U.S. company which was negotiating a
big supply contract suddenly found its executives were being
denied visas, said a person familiar with the issue who did not
want to be identified.
 One of the reasons decision-making in Libya can sometimes
seem arbitrary, say some analysts, is the rivalry among
Gaddafi's own offspring.
 Foreign-educated Saif al-Islam took part in the talks that
led to international sanctions being lifted. He is lobbying for
Libya to reform its institutions. Mutassim is national security
adviser and close to the military and security apparatus.
 When Libya raised the stakes in its dispute with Switzerland
-- a move many interpreted as the work of the old guard -- Saif
al-Islam made his feelings clear by telling a newspaper he was
""sad about these quixotic battles"".
 In the background are five other sons and a daughter. They
include Hannibal, who is head of the national shipping company,
Khamis, a senior military leader and Saadi, a businessman who
used to play professional soccer in Italy.
 Gaddafi's daughter Ayesha is a lawyer who was part of the
defence team of executed former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
 Fetouri, the Libyan academic, says weak rule of law, poor
management, and corruption -- which he describes as ""a national
sport"" -- are holding back foreign investment.
 But he is hopeful. ""Transparency is still lacking but it's
making progress ... Rule of law is gaining ground,"" he said. ""We
have come a long way and the way ahead is still a bit longer.""

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro surged on Thursday, buoyed
by short-covering ahead of a long weekend and after comments from
an official in China alleviated some concerns that the country
may be distancing itself from euro zone debt holdings.
 The euro first rebounded sharply after nearing last week's
four-year low earlier in the day, gaining steam as a climb in
Asian shares gave a broad lift to yen crosses.
 It then extended gains and touched an intraday high after a
government official told Reuters that China remains committed to
its long-standing goal of diversifying its foreign exchange
reserves.
 Separately, the head of China's $300 billion sovereign wealth
fund, China Investment Corp, told Xinhua news agency in an
interview that the Greek debt crisis will not have a big impact
on China's overseas investments.
 The euro, battered by Europe's debt crisis, had come under
more pressure after the Financial Times reported on Wednesday
that China was reviewing its euro zone debt holdings because of
growing concerns about gaping deficits in countries including
Greece and Portugal.
 ""It is not as if there was some particular trigger, but
equities are rising and recently the moves in yen crosses have
been linked pretty closely to the stock market,"" said a trader
for a Japanese brokerage house.
 ""In addition, Singapore is on holiday tomorrow and some
overseas markets will be closed on Monday, so this may be
short-covering ahead of a long weekend,"" the trader said.
 The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.2261, up about a full cent
from its intraday low of $1.2154 on trading platform EBS.
 The euro managed to hold above last week's four-year trough
of $1.2143 as well as support near $1.2135, which is roughly a 50
percent retracement of its rally from a record trough near
$0.8225 to its all-time peak of $1.6040.
 But traders said there was good selling interest in the euro
at $1.2300.
 There was also talk of option barriers at $1.2100 and then at
$1.2000. Any investors holding such positions would likely buy
the euro when it falls toward those levels to defend the barrier.
But the euro's fall could deepen if such levels are breached.
 The euro rallied 1 percent against the yen to 110.58 yen,
pulling away from an 8-½ year low of 108.83 yen hit on trading
platform EBS on Tuesday.
 ""As the euro fell to historical levels, some short-covering
emerged but the currency is expected to try new lows,"" said
Michiyoshi Kato, senior vice president for forex sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank.
 Worries about tighter dollar funding, with costs for banks to
borrow dollars in the interbank market posting fresh 10-month
highs on Wednesday, may prompt investors to shift to the relative
safety of the greenback and away from riskier assets and
currencies, traders said.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent to $0.8302 and climbed
1.4 percent to 74.81 yen.
 There was much talk about a Japanese mutual fund to be
launched by Nomura Asset Management on Thursday.
 Speculation that the fund may attract solid demand from
Japanese retail investors helped weigh on the yen, although some
market players were sceptical.
 The fund will invest in bonds issued by international
organisations while taking currency exposure in high-yielding,
emerging market currencies.
 The upper subscription limit for the Nomura Asset Management
fund is 150 billion yen. One caveat is that actual launch amounts
for Japanese mutual funds are often much smaller than the upper
limit.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 90.16 yen.

foreign affairs researcher said on Thursday.
 The comments by Yang Jiemian, brother of Chinese foreign
minister Yang Jiechi, are representative of one school of thought
in Beijing about how a sharp rise in the yuan  would
hurt China's own interests.
 ""Our reserves are accumulated at the price of our sweat and
blood, environment and hard labour, but the so-called exchange
rate issue may cause us to lose these fruits,"" said Yang,
president of the Shanghai Institute for International Studies.
 ""Of course we have to be firmer than before on this issue,""
he told a regular forum sponsored by China Centre for
International Economic Exchanges, a newly created think-tank
under China's planning agency.
 Yang listed the exchange rate, along with Taiwan and Tibet,
as issues that matter to China's ""core interests"".
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said this week at
talks in Beijing that whether to reform the yuan was China's own
choice. Chinese President Hu Jintao said that the government
would continue to reform the yuan exchange rate formation
mechanism. [ID:nLDE64O175]

-c.bank
 * Euro, stocks up after diversification goal restated
 * China likely to be more cautious about euro-banker
(Adds analyst's comments, background)
 By Aileen Wang and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, May 27 (Reuters) - Europe remains a key investment
market for China's foreign exchange reserves, the Chinese
central bank said on Thursday, helping to soothe markets
unnerved by a report that it was reviewing its euro-zone bond
holdings.
 The Financial Times said on Wednesday that China's State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) was meeting foreign
bankers because of concerns about its exposure to debt troubles
in Europe.
 ""This report has no basis in fact"", said SAFE, the arm of
the central bank that manages China's $2.4 trillion in foreign
exchange reserves, the world's largest stockpile.
 Roughly a quarter is estimated by analysts to be held in
euro-denominated assets, primarily sovereign bonds. The euro
has fallen more than 14 percent against the dollar this year,
reflecting investor concerns over the euro area debt crisis.
 A Chinese banker in Beijing, who has worked with the
country's reserve managers, said they were nervous about
Europe's outlook and were likely to exercise more caution about
buying euros in the short term.
 But Beijing has few other outlets for investing its vast
cash holdings and was quick to squelch any suggestion that it
was losing confidence in the euro, which would only undermine
the value of its own reserves.
 ""China is a responsible and long-term investor in the
investment of foreign exchange reserves and we always follow
the principle of diversification,"" it said in a statement on
the central bank's website (www.pbc.gov.cn)
 ""Europe was, is and will remain one of the major investment
markets for China's foreign exchange reserves,"" it said.
 It also said that China was confident that the euro zone
would be able to overcome its difficulties, adding that Beijing
supported the actions taken by the International Monetary Fund
and the European Union to stabilise financial markets.
 DIVERSIFICATION
 Earlier on Thursday, a government official familiar with
China's reserve management, said the country remained committed
to its long-standing goal of diversifying its foreign exchange
reserves.
 The euro, which had fallen towards a four-year low on
Wednesday, jumped to a day's high, after the official said that
the direction of diversification ""will not change"".
 U.S. stock futures also extended gains.
 Over the past few years, when China has mentioned
diversification, it has often been interpreted as referring to
its objective of reducing exposure to the dollar by lifting
investments in other currencies, such as the euro.
 Since China's reserves are expressed in dollar terms, when
the price of the non-dollar portion falls, the overall value of
the reserves declines.
 SAFE said on May 14 that the strength of the U.S. dollar
had reduced reserves by $48 billion in the first quarter.
 Analysts say that China has been shifting some of its
reserves into a wider range of currencies in recent months,
including assets elsewhere in Asia and in commodity-producing
countries.
 The Chinese banker who has worked with SAFE said that it
regularly sought outside opinions about the global economy and
there was nothing unusual about it setting up meetings to
discuss the euro.
 ""Marginally, I think they are concerned about what is
happening in Europe and they want to reduce their risk,"" he
said. ""What is happening in Europe is very uncertain and that
is what they want to avoid. At the end of the day, these guys
are bureaucrats.""
 FEW ALTERNATIVES
 China has been accumulating foreign exchange reserves at a
pace of about $30 billion per month this year.
 Only Europe and the United States offer debt markets large
enough and liquid enough to absorb that amount of cash, Stephen
Green, an economist with Standard Chartered in Shanghai, said.
 ""Last year the United States looked creaky. Now Europe
looks creaky. As the world's biggest international creditor,
China has a problem in a world where debtors are not looking so
healthy,"" he said.
 It would be hard for China to stop buying European assets,
let alone start selling its holdings, when it has to invest
such a volume of foreign exchange on a daily basis, Green said.
 ""At the margin, I think is it plausible that they buy less
euro and more dollar assets,"" he added.
 China has gone to lengths in the past day to assure global
markets that it still has confidence in the euro.
 The country's $300 billion sovereign wealth fund will not
cut its investments in Europe despite the fall in the euro, Gao
Xiqing, chairman of China Investment Corp, said on Wednesday in
Paris.
 ""For a while, we were debating whether to underweight
Europe, but our conclusion probably is not to underweight it,""
he said.

 * Very few companies have cancelled orders due to euro crisis
 * China most important market, very strong this year

 By Farah Master
 SHANGHAI, May 27 (Reuters) - Finnish lift and escalator maker
Kone is upbeat about its profit and sales outlook for 2010
despite a worsening debt crisis in the euro zone, its chief
executive said on Thursday.
 Kone's order book for 2010 remains very strong with robust
growth in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, Chief
Executive Matti Alahuhta said in an interview.
 ""We have confidence for this year. We have a very strong
order book, which is one of the big reasons why we have this
forecast,"" Alahuhta said. He added that the company had very few
cancellations of global orders in the past few months.
 Alahuhta remained confident that the company, which builds
elevators for skyscrapers, ships and airports, would achieve an
operating profit of between 580 million euros ($705.6 million)
and 620 million euros this year, a forecast made in April.
 Kone's Asia-Pacific business accounts for about 17 percent of
its global total, with China making up the bulk of that, he said.
 ""Demand in China this year has been very strong. Urbanisation
has been and will be driving the Chinese market in a strong way,
and therefore China is high on our priorities,"" Alahuhta said.
 He declined to provide sales projections for China, but said
the firm, which has sold elevators for use in high-profile
buildings including Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium, was continuing
to add new offices and employees there.
 Kone currently employs 3,500 people in China, out of a global
workforce of 54,000.
 That growth will come in part by Kone's expanding into the
country's relatively underdeveloped interior, where government
policies supporting urbanisation will lead to more construction,
Alahuhta said.
 Kone shares closed up 3.7 percent at 30.88 euros on
Wednesday.

716,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2010 11:31PM ET</span>",POLL-Japan fund managers raise stock weightings in May," * Allocation shifts slightly to stocks from bonds
 * Some see worries over European debt as overblown
 * Fund managers raise euro zone stock weighting, cut U.S.
 By Akiko Takeda
 TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers slightly
raised their weighting for stocks in May from the previous
month's seven-year low on the view that recent market pessimism
over Europe's debt woes is overblown.
 But some fund managers are nervous about market volatility
and fret that further fallout from the European debt crisis could
infect the global economy.
 ""Market players have recently sold the euro on almost any
excuse, including Germany's ban on naked short-selling. To me,
these reactions smack of typical overshooting,"" said Yoshinori
Nagano, senior strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.
 The average share weighting edged up to 45.0 percent in May
from 44.8 percent in April, which was a seven-year low.
 The average bond weighting dropped to 48.4 percent from a
10-month high of 49.1 percent in April, according to the poll of
11 fund managers taken from May 13-21. The weighting for cash
rose slightly to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent.
 During the survey period, global share prices plunged on
concerns that Europe's deepening debt crisis might derail a
global economic recovery.
 The U.S. Standard and Poor's Index has fallen nearly 10
percent so far this month, while Japan's Nikkei share average has
dropped more than 13 percent.
 The massive fall in share prices has made some fund managers
cautious.
 ""We are reducing risk assets, considering Europe's debt
problems and their impact on the global economy. We are also
increasing our short positions on the euro to prepare for further
deterioration in Europe's fiscal woes,"" said a fund manager who
declined to be identified because of company policy.
 But others were more bullish on the global economic outlook.
 ""At first, the EU wasn't so united in supporting bailout
schemes but their political determination is getting strong,
reducing the risk of full-scale global financial crisis,"" said
Yuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Life.
 ""Financial markets may be too pessimistic about the European
situation.""
 Fund managers increased their weightings on euro zone shares
within their equity portfolio to 12.1 percent from 10.4 percent.
 Meiji Yasuda's Kodama said the German economy is gaining
strength and is expected to benefit further from the recent fall
in the euro.
 On the other hand, the weighting for U.S. and Canada dropped
to a 5 1/2-year low of 42.0 percent from 43.6 percent in April,
while that for UK slipped to a six-year trough of 6.4 percent
from 6.6 percent.
 Within bond portfolios, the weighting for North American
bonds dropped to match a record low of 25.9 percent hit in
February, compared to 26.5 percent in April.
 The weighting for euro zone bonds increased slightly to 32.2
percent from 32.0 percent. Japanese investors mostly invest in
major euro zone nation bonds, such as German debt, and have
limited exposure to Southern European sovereign bonds.

 * Strong demand in Asia, particularly China, supports

(Adds details)
 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Japanese exports marked their
fifth-largest annual gain on record in April, a sign that brisk
demand from fast-growing emerging Asian nations is underpinning
the country's fragile economic recovery.
 The euro's weakness triggered by the European debt crisis had
little effect on shipments to the region, although analysts warn
the effect may gradually be felt if the crisis is prolonged.
 Exports rose 40.4 percent in April from a year earlier, more
than a median market forecast for a 38.9 percent increase and the
fifth straight month of gains, trade balance data released by the
Ministry of Finance showed on Thursday. Compared with March,
exports rose 2.3 percent in April.
 ""Exports remain very firm even after very strong growth in
January-March. The pace of export growth will slow in April-June,
but we expect exports to continue to expand,"" said Azusa Kato, an
economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo.
 Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's
total exports, rose 45.3 percent from a year earlier, on strong
demand for electronic and auto parts. While the rise was smaller
than annual gains exceeding 50 percent marked each month so far
this year, it was bigger than any other export destination.
 Asian economies, particularly China, have enjoyed robust
growth even as developed nations suffer concerns about huge
public debt in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
 The OECD forecasts China's economy will grow 11.1 percent
this year, far stronger than 3.0 percent predicted for Japan and
3.2 percent in the United States.
 U.S.-bound shipments were up 34.5 percent on brisk car
demand. Shipments to the European Union increased 19.8 percent
from a year earlier, slowing from a 26.7 percent gain in March
but marking the fifth straight month of increase.
 The slowdown was due almost entirely to the fact that exports
to Europe staged a rebound in April last year, making the annual
pace of gains appear small for this year's April data, analysts
said.
 LIMITED IMPACT FROM EUROPE
 Transport disruption caused by the volcano in Iceland, which
led to flight cancellations and airport closures in Europe, had
little impact on Japan's trade with the region, a finance
ministry official told a briefing on Thursday.
 Economists say the debt crisis in Europe will also have
little impact on the Japanese economy as exports to the region
account for only about 10 percent of total exports.
 But some say further turmoil in financial markets could
disrupt the global economic rebound and stifle Japan's export-led
recovery.
 ""The European problems will not directly impact Japanese
exports but they may affect the country's exports indirectly from
the latter half of this year if Asia takes a hit, as it depends
on European-bound shipments to a greater degree,"" said Junko
Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities.
 The yen's rises against the euro may also hurt exports if
they are prolonged and lead to yen gains against the dollar.
 The euro hovered near 8-½ year lows versus the yen at
around 109.90 yen on Thursday on persistent worries about
Europe's debt problems.
 That is unwelcome news for many Japanese exporters, who have
set their currency assumption rates for euro/yen at 120-125 yen
for the year to March. A stronger yen eats into exporters'
profits when repatriated.
 The finance ministry official said the government is closely
watching how Europe's debt problems and the ensuing fall in the
euro against the yen will affect exports.
 Exports have been recovering faster than many economists
forecast in the past few months, prompting economists to revise
up their forecasts for Japan's growth.
 Strong exports helped the Japanese economy grow 1.2 percent
in January-March, outpacing growth in the United States and the
euro zone in the same period.
 The trade balance came to a surplus of 742.3 billion yen
($8.25 billion), compared with the median estimate for a 709.3
billion yen surplus.

 * Trade deficit, inflation, reserves still a worry
 * Markets see 8.4 pct slide in dong vs dollar in 12 months
 By John Ruwitch and Rafael Nam
 VINH PHUC, Vietnam, May 27 (Reuters) - Costantino Sambuy,
local head of scooter maker Piaggio, opened a plant in Vietnam
last June and faced two risks that beset most foreign investors
-- a dollar shortage in the banking system and the ever-present
threat of devaluation of the local currency.
 The first, he says he's skirted by paying in euros whenever
possible for imported parts that go into Piaggio's stylish,
upmarket motorbikes. ""We are trying to eliminate the dollar
from our process, and it's working,"" he said.
 The second, the government appears to have solved, removing
a major risk for foreign investors and local traders alike --
at least for now.
 A two-year struggle by Vietnamese authorities -- which
included four devaluations -- has taken pressure off the dong
and brought the foreign exchange market under control.
 Central Bank Governor Nguyen Van Giau declared in mid-April
foreign exchange supply and demand in balance. On May 13, the
State Bank vowed to keep the forex rate stable.
 The dong has strengthened around 4 percent since peaking
near 20,000 per dollar on the unofficial market and it now
trades mostly within the central bank-mandated band of 3
percent on either side of a daily reference rate.
 But some economists say challenges remain in the wider
economy, and those may have knock-on effects on the longer-term
strength of the dong.
 ""The challenges now are not short term, but they are the
medium-term challenges about inflation and the trade deficit
and the level of reserves that they have. Those fundamentals
haven't changed,"" said Jonathan Pincus, dean of Ho Chi Minh
City's Fulbright Economic Teaching Program.
 Relecting the unease, Vietnam's five-year credit default
swaps, which reflect the cost of insurance against default, are
at about 245 basis points, or about 80 basis points more than
regional peers the Philippines and Indonesia.
 The exact level of Vietnam's gross reserves is a state
secret, but the World Bank has estimated reserves will rise to
$17.5 billion by year-end after a fall of nearly 34 percent in
2009.
 Annual inflation was 9.23 percent in April, easing a tad
from March, but could hit double digits in coming months, which
officials have said would be a problem. The trade deficit hit
$4.65 billion in the first four months of the year.
 CONFIDENCE
 Where the dong heads will reflect overall confidence in the
economy, economists say.
 Last year's economic stimulus measures pushed Vietnam's
fiscal deficit to among the highest in the region. Officially
it was 6.9 percent of gross domestic product, but the
International Monetary Fund, which uses a different standard,
says it was closer to 9 percent.
 Non-deliverable forwards reflect expectations that a dollar
will be able to buy 19,725 dong in six months' time and 20,725
in a year, implying a slide of 3.7 percent and 8.4 percent
respectively from current values around 19,000.
 Still, the dollar crunch that hurt importers for most of
2009 has ended. The gap has almost disappeared between official
dollar-dong rates and unofficial, or black market, rates, which
widened to more than 10 percent last year.
 The currency has also benefited from the end of a cap on
dong lending rates, which has lifted the cost of dong loans
while dollar lending and deposit rates have been tethered at
much lower levels. Dollar loans at the end of April were up
17.5 percent from the end of 2009, while dong loans were up 2.3
percent, state media reported.
 But that, said a senior currency trader at a major foreign
bank in Vietnam, could be sowing the seeds of trouble down the
line. Most of the loans were on three-month terms, he said.
 ""They will need to be re-paid,"" he said, adding that would
increase demand for dollars and potentially push down the dong.
 Fitch, the ratings agency, warned in March it may downgrade
Vietnam's BB-minus local and foreign currency ratings due to
low confidence and lack of transparency for key economic data.
 Matt Hildebrandt, an economist at JP Morgan in Singapore,
said there was plenty to be concerned about. ""When I look
across Asia right now, of all the countries out there the most
likely for a downgrade for the external debt is Vietnam,"" he
said, adding however he did not expect a default.
 Down on Hanoi's Ha Trung Street, the heart of the city's
currency black market, business is slow but the money changers
aren't closing shop and changing jobs.
 ""It will go down again,"" said one foreign exchange dealer
who declined to be named because transactions in the dong
outside the official trading band are illegal.
 ""And everyone thinks by the end of the year it may be at
20,000, or possibly 21,000 if things are bad.""

719,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2010 08:03PM ET</span>",Japan April exports up 40.4 pct year/year - MOF," TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose 40.4 percent
in April from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on
Thursday, a sign that brisk demand particularly from Asia
underpins an export-led recovery in the world's No.2 economy.
 The gain in exports was above economists' median forecast for
a 38.9 percent rise, and imports were up 24.2 percent, against a
23.0 percent increase expected.
 Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's
total exports, rose 45.3 percent from a year earlier, while
shipments to European Union increased 19.8 percent.
 Japanese policymakers are wary that Europe's debt crisis may
be prolonged and hurt global economy, which in turn will hamper
Japan's recovery if its key export destinations in emerging Asia
take a hit.

 * Market talks of option barriers at $1.21, then $1.20
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 27 (Reuters) - The euro approached a four-year low
against the dollar and an 8-1/2-year low against the yen on
Thursday as a sell-off led by nagging worries about Europe's debt
trouble showed no signs of abating.
 The euro was also dragged down after the Financial Times
reported on Wednesday that China is reviewing its euro zone debt
holdings because of growing concerns about gaping deficits in
countries including Greece and Portugal.
 ""The report on China raises the prospect that other emerging
nations may follow suit. The impact is large as market attention
on China is high at the moment,"" said a trader at a Japanese
bank.
 ""The market is vulnerable to bad factors now and the euro
seems to have fallen into a negative spiral,"" he said.
 The euro inched down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade to
$1.2167, just above a four-year low of $1.2143 hit on trading
platform EBS last week.
 The euro has lost more than 8 percent against the dollar so
far this month and is heading for its biggest monthly fall since
October 2008.
 There was market talk of option barriers at $1.2100 and then
at $1.2000.
 The euro was little moved on the day at 109.46 yen, hovering
close to an 8-1/2-year low of 108.83 yen hit on EBS earlier this
week.
 Worries about tighter dollar funding, with costs for banks to
borrow dollars in the interbank market posting fresh 10-month
highs on Wednesday, are prompting investors to shift to the
relative safety of the greenback and away from riskier assets and
currencies, traders said.
 U.S. two-year swap spreads, a key gauge of financial system
stress, ended on Wednesday around 48 basis points, having widened
to one-year highs on Tuesday.
 The dollar was steady at 89.85 yen.

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and the euro
ended lower on Wednesday, with the Dow closing below 10,000
for the first time since early February, after a report said
China was reviewing its euro-zone debt holdings -- feeding
investors' concerns that the European debt crisis could
reverse the global economic recovery.
 Gold prices rose about 1 percent, building its best
three-day gain since January as dealers hedged against
Europe's sovereign debt problems and took advantage of the
desire for asset protection.
 Stocks lost their day's gains late in New York session on
investors' worries after Britain's Financial Times newspaper
said China is reviewing its euro-zone bond holdings because of
growing concern about gaping deficits in euro-zone member
countries, including Greece and Portugal. [ID:nWNA2135]
 The Dow slipped below 10,000, with the late turnaround in
stocks showing investor psyche is still fragile.
 The euro slid 1.6 percent to $1.2169, close to a four-year
low hit last week. The single European currency was stung by
concerns about tighter dollar funding, with three-month dollar
interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month high. Poor demand at
a German debt auction also weighed, analysts said. For more
see [ID:nLDE64P0GQ] and [ID:nLDE64P0VB].
 Oil prices however, settled above $71 a barrel, climbing 4
percent in the biggest one-day increase in nearly eight
months, due to an improvement in risk appetite and a big
increase in U.S. oil demand. [ID:nN26228524] U.S. July crude
futures  shot up $2.76 to settle at $71.51 a barrel.
 U.S. June gold futures ended at $1,213.40 an ounce, up 1.3
percent, or a gain on the day of $15.40.
 ""It is not as if the market needs new reasons to be
bearish the euro, but the news that the market seems to be
reacting to now is a Financial Times piece claiming,
apparently without attribution, that China's State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is reviewing its
holdings of European bonds,"" Marc Chandler, global head of
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said
in a note.
 UNDERSTANDING CHINA
 Stock market investors were pushed by the FT report to
take some profits, driving the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> to drop 69.30 points, or 0.69 percent, to close at
9,974.45.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 6.08 points,
or 0.57 percent, to end at 1,067.95. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> lost 15.07 points, or 0.68 percent, to finish at
2,195.88.
 ""One rule that we have found is useful when trying to
(put) one's head around China is that China does not leak.
This would be, it seems, a leak. Therefore, while we suspect
all investors must be thinking about what is happening in the
euro zone, we don't see this as really news,"" Chandler added.
 Concerns over European bank funding, specially after Spain
took over a small savings bank, CajaSur, over the weekend,
have pushed investors to take profits and buy into safe-haven
assets.
 In afternoon New York trading, the euro  fell
more than 1 percent to $1.2193/96, pulling back from a session
low of $1.2182 set on electronic trading platform EBS. The
euro hit a four-year low of $1.2143 on EBS last week and is
down about 15 percent so far this year.
 Earlier in the session, the euro took another dive on
speculation a large Spanish bank has been struggling to roll
over $1 billion in short-term funding in the U.S. commercial
paper market.
 A surge in U.S. durable good orders and new home sales for
April had boosted U.S. stocks and overall risk sentiment
earlier in the session, but did not help the euro.
[ID:nN25139665].
 In recent weeks, the euro has become a proxy for risk
appetite, given Europe's debt crisis, rising or falling in
tandem with global stocks.
 ""The overarching themes remain the same. The market is
very fearful of the contagion factor and the debt issue
dragging on the economy over there,"" said John Doyle, foreign
exchange strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""We're still very bearish on the euro and very hawkish on
the dollar. It does appear that the economies in the euro zone
are in a much weaker position than here in the United States,""
he added.
 EURO TALK
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner urged Europeans
on Wednesday to work for a globally consistent approach to
financial reform as the European Union said it might go it
alone with a plan to tax banks to pay for future rescues.
[ID:nSGE64P04M].
European shares <.FTEU3> rebounded by 2.5 percent from
Tuesday's nine-month lows, but the euro  remained under
pressure amid continuing signs of banks' reluctance to lend to
euro-zone counterparts exposed to southern European sovereign
debt.
 Geithner's stress on coordination of new regulation
appeared aimed chiefly at Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
which stunned markets and angered its European Union partners
by unilaterally banning some speculative financial trades last
week. [ID:nLDE64O1HJ]
 BONDS SLIP AFTER AUCTION
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell on Wednesday, pulling
benchmark yields up from one-year lows, as the week's $113
billion worth of government bond auctions weighed on a market
that has rallied to rich levels recently.
 Though the moves weren't dramatic, they suggested the
market had become pricey after weeks of safe-haven flows into
Treasuries and dollar assets as investors sought refuge from
the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Overall demand for Treasury's $40 billion five-year
auction was a tad lower than last month and pricing suggested
that dealers were somewhat aggressive in bidding prices lower
to secure a yield premium. For details see [ID:nN26215188].
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 9/32, with the yield at 3.1922 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at
0.8172 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 22/32, with the yield at 4.0956 percent.

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, May 26 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar climbed
against the U.S. currency on Wednesday as investors piled back
into riskier assets, including stocks and oil, but it pared
gains late in the day as optimism about the global economy
waned.
 The Canadian dollar jumped more than a cent to hit a
session high of C$1.0580, or 94.52 cents, early in the day as
North American equities rallied and the price of oil leaped
over $71 a barrel, its biggest gain in three months. [.N] [.TO]

 Adding impetus was a newspaper report that said the
Australian government is planning to dampen the impact of its
planned resources tax by lifting the threshold at which it
would kick in. That would be good news for mining shares and
commodity-linked currencies such as Canada's. [ID:nLDE64P228]
 But the Canadian dollar weakened as the day progressed as
stocks reversed course after the Financial Times reported China
was reviewing its euro-zone debt holdings, which brought
European debt jitters back to the fore. [ID:nWNA2135].
 ""It was higher ... when the news came out about Australia
rethinking its mining tax, Canada rallied quite aggressively
but really it's been moving hand in hand with equities
generally,"" said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange trading
at BMO Capital Markets.
 The Canadian dollar closed the North American session at
C$1.0686 to the U.S. dollar, or 93.58 U.S. cents, up from
Tuesday's close of C$1.0700 to the U.S. dollar, or 93.46 U.S.
cents.
 The Canadian dollar did better on the crosses, Askari said.
It held near multi-year highs against the euro, rising as high
as C$1.2958, or 77.17 euro cents.
 On Tuesday, the Canadian dollar fell to its lowest mark in
almost seven months in a broad global selloff of riskier assets
amid growing concern about Europe's debt crisis and the
prospect of a Korean military conflict.
 In a note to clients on Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets'
chief technical strategist, George Davis, said the currency
had to break C$1.0525 to show the weakening trend is losing
momentum.
 Recent volatility afflicting financial markets has spurred
debate whether the Bank of Canada will start raising interest
rates on June 1, its next scheduled policy setting date.
 ""The recovering risk appetite keeps the door open to a Bank
of Canada rate hike next week, that's supportive of the
Canadian dollar,"" said Fergal Smith, managing market strategist
at Action Economics.
 The expectations of a central bank rate increase, reflected
in yields on overnight index swaps, are tilted slightly toward
a 25 basis point hike in Canadian interest rates next week.

 BONDS LOSE AT SHORT END
 Canadian bonds mostly fell, tracking U.S. Treasuries, which
were weighed down as renewed risk appetite and strength in
stocks eroded the safe-haven appeal of government debt. [US/]
 The two-year government bond  dropped 7 Canadian
cents to C$99.76 to yield 1.622 percent, but the 10-year bond
 clawed back from losses to gain 2 Canadian cents to
C$101.100 to yield 3.253 percent.
 However, Canada's auction of 30-year real return bonds met
with tamer demand than usual as investors, fearing Europe's
debt crisis will dampen global growth, shied away from
lower-yielding but inflation-protected government debt.
[ID:nN26213207]
 With a rate hike still being priced in near term, Canadian
bonds lagged U.S. Treasuries at the short end of the curve, but
outperformed at the long end.
 Bond prices, particularly for shorter-term issues, tend to
fall when interest rates go up as their fixed coupon payments
seem less lucrative than rising yields on other investments.
 ""In periods of risk aversion, the front of the Canadian
curve has outperformed because the market has been backing out
of Canadian rate hikes,"" Smith said. ""We've had a bit of an
unwind of the flight to quality today.""
 The Canadian 10-year bond was 6.7 basis points above the
U.S. 10-year yield, compared with 9.5 basis points above on
Tuesday.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro approached a
four-year low against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday on
persistent concerns about Europe's debt woes and after news
suggesting that China was reassessing its euro zone debt
holdings.
 China is reviewing its euro zone bond holdings because of
growing concerns about gaping deficits in countries including
Greece and Portugal, the Financial Times reported on
Wednesday.
 ""China will likely move to clarify this headline in the
near future and in the process try to placate market fears of
China dumping euro bonds,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""However, the damage is done and the notion will stick,
especially in a market that still prefers to embrace euro
negative rather than positive news,"" he added.
 In late New York trading, the euro fell 1.6 percent to
$1.2171, after hitting a session low of $1.2166 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 The euro last week hit its lowest level since April 2006 at
$1.2143 on EBS and is down about 15 percent so far this year.
 The euro could re-test the key $1.2135 long-term support
level in the next few days, with a break opening the door for a
deeper slide toward $1.2125 to $1.2050, according to BNP
Paribas.
 The FT said representatives of China's State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, which manages the reserves under
the country's central bank, have been meeting with foreign
bankers in Beijing to discuss the euro zone bond holdings.
 SAFE holds an estimated $630 billion of euro-zone bonds in
its reserves, the newspaper said. The exact makeup of China's
roughly $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves is a state
secret.
 Against the yen, the euro was at 109.48 yen, near a session
low. On Tuesday, it tumbled to 108.83 yen, its lowest since
November 2001. The euro also slid to a two-week low versus
sterling.
 Concerns about tighter dollar funding, with three-month
dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month high, and poor
demand at a German debt auction also weighed on the euro,
analysts said.
 U.S. data showing a surge in durable goods orders and sales
of new homes at nearly two-year highs added to the market's
view the U.S. economy will outperform Europe.
 ""The overarching themes remain the same. The market is very
fearful of the contagion factor and the debt issue dragging on
the economy over there,"" said John Doyle, foreign exchange
strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""We're still very bearish on the euro and very hawkish on
the dollar. It does appear that the economies in the euro zone
are in a much weaker position than here in the United States,""
Doyle said.
 This week's pressure on the euro started after the Spanish
central bank took over a small savings bank over the weekend,
which raised fears of weaknesses in Europe's banking system.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said on Wednesday that
Europe has the right ideas to solve its fiscal crisis and needs
to put them into practice to calm markets.
 Geithner was in London at the start of a two-day European
visit to confer with officials about ways to shore up the world
economic recovery. He pressed for greater international
cooperation to cope with the crisis spreading through southern
Europe, which is sapping investor confidence.

 * Icesave talks with Britain, Netherlands unresolved
 * Bank crisis still haunts Iceland's state budget
 (Adds details)
 By Justyna Pawlak
 BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) - Iceland should ensure that
Dutch and British investors in failed bank Icesave receive at
least minimum compensation for lost deposits, a European trade
body overseeing Iceland's cooperation with the EU (EFTA) said
on Wednesday.
 The British and Dutch governments paid out billions of
euros to depositors whose funds were frozen in failed online
Icelandic bank Icesave. The two countries have held so far
unsuccessful talks with Iceland on being repaid for footing the
compensation bill.
 The EFTA Surveillance Authority said in a letter of formal
notice, the first stage in legal proceedings that can end up in
court, that Iceland had breached relevant directives in
treating Dutch and British depositors differently from those in
Iceland.
 Under the terms of Iceland's participation in the European
Economic Area Agreement, the country is required to provide
compensation of at least 20,000 euros ($24,570) per deposit, it
added.
 ""Iceland ... (is) under obligation to provide the minimum
compensation,"" the authority added in a letter to the
government of Iceland, which has applied to join the European
Union.
 The authority also noted that talks with the Dutch and
British were taking place and that if a solution was found then
it would not need to take any further action.
 The authority said Iceland had argued that setting up a
guarantee scheme was enough to fulfill its obligations.
 Iceland's government also argued that a major bank crisis
could mean the deposit guarantee directive was not applicable.
 ""The Authority disagrees on both points,"" it said. Iceland
had two months to respond to the warning, the authority said.
 ""This is important. It is the start of a process which
could end up before the EFTA court,"" Economics Minister Gylfi
Magnusson was quoted as saying on the website of Icelandic
newspaper Morgunbladid.
 TALKS ON ICE
 Magnusson said Iceland still wanted a solution to its
dispute with the British and the Dutch. ""We will continue our
efforts to bring the Dutch and the British to the negotiating
table but they have been reluctant to do so in recent weeks,""
he said.
 He said little had been heard from the new British
government on the issue, although there had been contacts
between the two governments before and after the UK election.
 He said he was disappointed the ESA did not support
Iceland, but expressed optimism the dispute would not end up in
court.
 A Dutch spokesman said Wednesday's ruling was in line with
his government's expectations and reiterated that the country,
which holds an election in early June, was waiting for a new
proposal from Reykjavik.
 ""The Netherlands has consistently argued there were
obligations and it therefore welcomes the decision. We trust
that this will contribute to a timely solution,"" he said.
 ""We stand ready to engage Iceland constructively, however,
we have been waiting quite some time for a realistic proposal
that takes into account the Icelandic obligations,"" he added.
 In March, Icelanders overwhelmingly rejected the terms of a
deal to repay the $5 billion lost by savers in a banking
collapse that followed the 2008 global financial crisis.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell for a third
straight session against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday,
pressured by persistent worries that a debt crisis in the euro
zone will spread and hamper economic growth in the region.
 The euro zone common currency extended losses to hit a
session low after Britain's Financial Times newspaper said
China is reviewing its euro zone bond holdings because of
growing concern about gaping deficits in euro zone member
countries including Greece and Portugal.
 Concerns about tighter dollar funding, with three-month
dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month high, and poor
demand at a German debt auction also weighed, analysts said.
 U.S. data showing a surge in durable goods orders and new
home sales at nearly two-year highs added to the market's view
the U.S. economy will outperform Europe.
 ""The overarching themes remain the same. The market is very
fearful of the contagion factor and the debt issue dragging on

strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""We're still very bearish on the euro and very hawkish on

he added.
 In afternoon New York trading, the euro fell more than 1
percent to $1.2193/96, pulling back from a session low of
$1.2182 set on electronic trading platform EBS.
 The euro hit a four-year low of $1.2143 on EBS last week
and is down about 15 percent so far this year.
 Pressure on the euro this week started after the Spanish
central bank's takeover of a savings bank over the weekend,
which highlighted weaknesses in Europe's banking system.
 Earlier in the session, the euro took another dive on
speculation a large Spanish bank has been struggling to roll
over $1 billion in short-term funding in the U.S. commercial
paper market.
 Europe has the right ideas to solve its fiscal crisis and

international cooperation to cope with the crisis spreading

 Investors dumped the euro even as global stocks rallied
after the stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data.
 In recent months, the euro has become a proxy for risk
appetite, rising or falling in tandem with stock performance.
But that pattern changed on Wednesday.
 ""We're having a cautious bounce in market sentiment after
upbeat U.S. data, but it's not helping the euro because people
are still concerned about debt problems in the euro zone,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo
in New York.
 ""Markets are being selective and are instead buying those
with healthier fundamentals such as the Aussie and Canadian
dollar,"" he said.
 Against the yen, the euro was at session lows at 109.88. On
Tuesday, it tumbled to 108.83, its lowest since November 2001.
The euro also slid 1.3 percent to 84.60 pence.
 The dollar was off more than 1 percent against the yen at
90.10.

 * Not IMF role to tell Spain what to do-Strauss-Kahn
 * IMF SDRs should be convertible to yuan, real-Mantega
(Adds details)
 BRASILIA, May 26 (Reuters) - Part of a rescue package meant
to shore up the euro should go toward sparking growth, the
managing director of the International Monetary Fund said on
Wednesday.
 While the $1 trillion euro stabilization plan from the IMF
and the European Union, meant to ease concerns about a
sovereign debt crisis in some nations, is helpful, ""part of
this money should be used to boost growth,"" Dominique
Strauss-Kahn told reporters in Brazil's capital.
 ""Because without growth prospect in the euro zone and
European countries it will be difficult to get out of the
crisis.""
 Nor is it the role of the IMF to tell Spain -- among euro
zone nations now facing fiscal crisis -- how to solve its
problems, Strauss-Kahn said.
 But, he added, that country is going in the right
direction.
 Deep debts in Spain, Greece and Portugal, among others,
have roiled markets in recent weeks, sparking investor fears of
sovereign defaults and the possibility of a hobbled euro zone
economy dragging on a global recovery.
 Investors have responded by dumping riskier assets and
running to safe havens such as the U.S. dollar and the Japanese
yen.
 In contrast, Strauss-Kahn heaped praise on Brazil's
economy, noting its brisk expansion and praising government
policies taken during the global financial crisis to bring the
country back to growth.
 Now is probably time for those stimulus measures to be
withdrawn, Strauss-Kahn said.
 The IMF will ""see how the (Brazilian) government will
manage to have again next year and the year after this high
level of growth, but I am confident that this will be done,"" he
said.
 But he said little about increasing the participation of
emerging countries in the IMF, even as Brazil's finance
minister, Guido Mantega, called for a bigger role for Latin
America's biggest economy in the fund while speaking at the
same event.
 The IMF's special drawing rights should be convertible into
the Chinese yuan and the Brazilian real  as well, Mantega
said.
 The SDR is the IMF's international reserve asset, meant to
supplement member countries' official reserves. The basket of
currencies that defines the rights includes the euro, yen,
pound sterling, and dollar.

 (Adds background, more quotes)
 By John Irish
 PARIS, May 26 (Reuters) - China's sovereign wealth fund will
not cut its investments in Europe despite the fall in the euro,
but will closely monitor how the continent tackles currency and
regulation issues, the fund's head said on Wednesday.
 ""We will keep our allocation in Europe,"" China Investment
Corporation president and chief investment officer Gao Xiqing
said at a the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) 2010 Forum in Paris.
 ""For a while, we were debating whether to underweight
Europe, but our conclusion probably is not to underweight it,""
he said.
 Sovereign funds, which together manage around $3 trillion
of assets, are becoming more aggressive after turning cautious
in 2008 at the height of the credit crisis when they lost
billions on banks such as UBS and Citigroup.
 Gao said Europe remained a very important market, albeit
with problems, and CIC would have to look carefully whether or
not policies in the European Union on currency and regulations
would allow a return to previous growth rates.
 CIC was set up in September 2007, with the aim of seeking
higher returns for part of the country's massive stockpile of
foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $2.39 trillion at the
end of 2009. 
 It has invested $110 billion since then taking its assets
under management to about $300 billion and has a minimum
investment of $100 million, Gao told reporters. 
 ""(Our weighting) depends on the overall GDP growth, so we're
actually higher in North America and Europe if you count it by
GDP calculation,"" Gao told reporters, calling its weighting in
those areas ""too high.""
 He said the fund was looking at emerging markets including
in Latin America and the Middle East and was open to sectors
other than military manufacturing, gambling and tobacco.
 
 SPECTRE OF COMMUNISM
 He said Europe needed to open itself more to foreign
investors to spur growth, joking that the ""spectre of communism""
seemed still to be haunting the continent.
 Referring to a line from Karl Marx's ""Communist Manifesto"",
Gao said Europe appeared to be embracing greater state control

 ""Karl Marx said the spectre of communism was haunting

distressed assets this year.
 Some of the world's biggest state funds from Asia, Kuwait

few sources of long-term capital prepared to ride out bouts of

western governments concerned that it could be positioning
itself to gain control over strategic sectors.

 * Icesave talks with Britain and the Netherlands unresolved
 * Bank crisis still haunts Iceland's state budget
 
 (Adds Dutch reaction)
 By Justyna Pawlak
 BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) - Iceland should ensure that
Dutch and British investors in failed bank Icesave receive at
least minimum compensation for lost deposits, a European trade
body overseeing Iceland's cooperation with the EU (EFTA) said on
Wednesday.
 The British and Dutch governments paid out billions of euros
to depositors whose funds were frozen in failed online Icelandic
bank Icesave. The two countries have held so far unsuccessful
talks with Iceland on being repaid for footing the compensation
bill.
 The EFTA Surveillance Authority said in a letter of formal
notice, the first stage in legal proceedings that can end up in
court, that Iceland had breached relevant directives in treating
Dutch and British depositors differently from those in Iceland.
 Under the terms of Iceland's participation in the European
Economic Area Agreement, the country is required to provide
compensation of at least 20,000 euros ($24,570) per deposit, it
added.
 ""Iceland ... (is) under obligation to provide the minimum
compensation,"" the authority added in a letter to the government
of Iceland, which has applied to join the European Union.
 The authority also noted that talks with the Dutch and
British were taking place and that if a solution was found then
it would not need to take any further action.
 The authority said Iceland had argued that setting up a
guarantee scheme was enough to fulfil its obligations.
 Iceland's government also argued that a major bank crisis
could mean the deposit guarantee directive was not applicable.
 ""The Authority disagrees on both points,"" it said. Iceland
had two months to respond to the warning, the authority said.
 ""This is important. It is the start of a process which could
end up before the EFTA court,"" Economics Minister Gylfi
Magnusson was quoted as saying on the Website of Icelandic
newspaper Morgunbladid. 
 He said Iceland still wanted a solution to its dispute with
the British and the Dutch. ""We will continue our efforts to
bring the Dutch and the British to the negotiating table but
they have been reluctant to do so in recent weeks,"" he said.
 He said little had been heard from the new British
government on the issue, although there had been contacts
between the two governments before and after the UK election.
 He said he was disappointed the ESA did not support Iceland,
but expressed optimism the dispute would not end up in court.
 Talks with the Dutch government should pick up after an
election there in early June and a spokesman said Wednesday's
ruling was in line with Amsterdam's expectations.
 ""The Netherlands has consistently argued there were
obligations and it therefore welcomes the decision. We trust
that this will contribute to a timely solution of the Icesave
issue,"" he said.

 * U.S., European stocks rise as risk appetite returns
 * Oil jumps nearly 4 pct,
 * Safe-haven bonds fall on risk appetite
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar for a third straight day on Wednesday on persistent
fears over the euro zone's debt problems, even as renewed risk
appetite boosted global stocks.
 The euro slid more than against the dollar, stung by
concerns about tighter credit conditions, but stayed above the
8-1/2 year lows hit on Tuesday. Jittery investors also drove up
the price of gold as they sought safety in a hard asset amid
the concerns about Europe and volatile currency markets.
 But other markets shrugged off fears to charge higher. Oil
prices rallied nearly 4 percent, climbing back above $71 a
barrel as gains in equity markets overshadowed rising crude
stocks. [ID:nSGE64P06D]
 The euro, however, continued to stagger, also hit by
concerns about tighter dollar funding conditions as three-month
dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month high on
Wednesday and a surprisingly lackluster German debt auction.

 ""There is still a deeply negative sentiment toward the euro
due to the debt situation in Europe, the issue with Spain over
the weekend and how investors are bracing for the possibility
that other banks in the region may follow suit and may need a
bailout,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Travelex
Global Business Payments in Washington.
 Spain took over a small savings bank, CajaSur, over the
weekend, and analysts said the move highlighted weakness in the
European banking sector.
 Although the euro in recent weeks has become a proxy for
risk appetite, given Europe's debt crisis, and has tended to
rise or fall in tandem with global stocks, that link was
missing on Wednesday.
 The euro  dipped to $1.2222 against the dollar, down
1.21 percent on the day, according to Reuters data.
 The index of world stocks rose 2.1 percent, and emerging
stocks rose 2.7 percent, partially recovering Tuesday's 4
percent decline -- their biggest one-day fall in over a year.
 Since global equity markets peaked on April 15, $4.2
trillion in market value has been erased from the MSCI
all-country world stocks index. <.MIWD00000PUS>
 On Wall Street, investors snapped up shares of beaten-down
companies and were also boosted by a surge in U.S. durable good
orders and new home sales for April.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 76.93
points, or 0.77 percent, at 10,120.68. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 10.42 points, or 0.97 percent, at
1,084.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 27.31
points, or 1.24 percent, at 2,238.26.
 Banks and industrial stocks, among the worst-hit issues in
the pullback, were among the day's top gainers, with Citigroup
Inc  climbing 3.7 percent to $3.92 and industrial
conglomerate General Electric Co  up 3.2 percent.
Citigroup was upgraded to ""outperform"" by analysts at
Oppenheimer, which said the stock was a good value. For

Wednesday to work for a globally consistent approach to

 European shares rebounded, and the pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> closed up 2.4 percent at 972.17

the top gainers, lifted by improving risk appetite as copper

 Geithner's stress on coordination of new regulation
appeared aimed chiefly at Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
which stunned markets and angered its European Union partners
by unilaterally banning some speculative financial trades last
week. [ID:nLDE64O1HJ]

 ""I think the market really overreacted,"" said Nick Kalivas,
vice president of financial research and senior equity index
analyst, at MF Global. ""You've basically seen a comeback from
the lows and that has essentially created some positive
momentum.""
 Manufacturing is leading the economy's recovery from the
worst recession since the 1930s, but consumers are now stepping
up to the plate as the labor market improves.
""We now have five quarters of increases, and that's a good
sign of transitioning from a recovery to sustainable growth,""
said John Canally, investment strategist and economist at LPL
Financial in Boston.
 ""It's too early to gauge the impact of the European crisis
... (we) probably have to wait until May or even July to see an

 U.S. Treasuries briefly extended price losses after the
home sales rise in April, eroding the safe-haven luster of
government debt. 
 The rise in risk appetite hurt Treasuries, and the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down
21/32, with the yield at 3.234 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 3/32, with the yield at
0.8528 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 37/32, with the yield at 4.1212 percent.
 Treasuries prices were also undermined by traders looking

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell for a third
straight session against the dollar on Wednesday, pressured by
nagging fears about the European debt crisis.
 Concerns about tighter dollar funding conditions, with
three-month dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month
high on Wednesday, and a surprisingly lackluster German debt
auction also weighed on the euro, analysts said. For German
auction see [ID:nLDE64P0VB].
 A surge in U.S. durable goods orders and new home sales for
April boosted U.S. stocks and overall risk sentiment, but did
not help the euro. In recent weeks, the euro has become a proxy
for risk appetite, given Europe's debt crisis, rising or
falling in tandem with global stocks.
 But that changed on Wednesday and investors dumped euros
even as global stocks rallied.
 ""We're having a cautious bounce in market sentiment after
upbeat U.S. data, but it's not helping the euro because people
are still concerned about debt problems in the euro zone,"" said
Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist, at Wells Fargo
in New York.
 ""Markets are being selective and are instead buying those
with healthier fundamentals such as the Aussie and Canadian
dollar,"" he said.
 The euro's decline this week started with the Spanish
central bank's takeover of a savings bank over the weekend,
which highlighted systemic risks in Spain's banking system.
 Earlier in the session, the euro took another dive lower on
speculation that a large Spanish bank has been struggling to
roll over $1 billion in short-term funding in the U.S.
commercial paper market.
 In midday New York trading, the euro  fell 1.1
percent against the dollar to $1.2225 after hitting session
lows at $1.2191, according to electronic trading platform EBS.
On Tuesday it had hit a low of $1.2177 when investors pulled
back sharply from riskier assets. The euro last week hit its
lowest level since April 2006, falling to $1.2143.
 Data showing U.S. durable goods orders surged in April and
new home sales rose to a two-year high last month further
boosted the dollar against the euro. [ID:N26186476].
 David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International in New York, noted that the rise in home sales in
April came as the U.S. stock market hit its highest level in a
couple of years.
 ""It doesn't really tell us much at all except the economy
was clearly gaining some traction when the stock market
stumbled at the beginning of this month,"" he said.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner began a two-day,
multi-city European visit on Wednesday to confer with officials
about ways to shore up the world economic recovery. In London
Geithner said Europe has the right ideas to solve its fiscal
crisis but needs to put them into practice to calm markets.
 Geithner pressed the case for greater international
cooperation to cope with the crisis spreading through southern
Europe, which is sapping investor confidence. [ID:nLDE64P123].

sales
 
 By Polina Devitt and Alfred Kueppers
 MOSCOW, May 26 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin's description of steel price hikes as ""inexplicable""
served notice to local mills that raising prices further
threatens the nascent recovery in domestic manufacturing.
 Analysts said that while Monday's announcement and the
widening investigation by the Russian FAS anti-monopoly
regulator are unlikely to lead to steep fines against the
companies involved, they will curb prices in the local market.
 ""The government is frustrated by the weak manufacturing
recovery and sees that export-oriented businesses such as steel
are performing strongly; therefore, we speculate that steel
companies are being politely 'asked' to keep prices at
manageable levels,"" analysts at Moscow's Alfa Bank wrote in a
note to clients.
 At Monday's meeting, FAS head Igor Artemyev told Putin his
regulators had launched a case against Evraz after the prime
minister said the matter must be treated with ""the utmost
seriousness.""
 Putin's spokesman on Wednesday said the prime minister will
meet with metals firms to discuss the matter further next week.

 Officials at the watchdog then told Reuters prices at
Severstal, Russia's largest producer, and Magnitogorsk Iron &
Steel Works were being investigated alongside those at Evraz.
 Both Severstal and MMK declined to comment on Wednesday.
Evraz has said it was cooperating fully with the probe.
 
 WATCHDOG BARKS
 The FAS, which can impose fines totalling 1-15 percent of a
company's yearly sales, said its investigation arose out of
complaints by railway car and tank maker Uralvagonzavod about
rising prices.
 ""In the beginning of June, the FAS plans to complete an
analysis of price formation during production at Severstal and
MMK, and the result will show whether there are signs that these
companies' activities have violated anti-monopoly statutes,"" FAS
spokeswoman Irina Kashunina said.
 Press reports last month said Uralvagonzavod head Oleg
Siyenko had written to Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin calling
for domestic steel prices to be fixed until April 1, 2011
following a recent price surge.
 If steel makers disagreed, he asked the government to
introduce a 15 percent export duty.
 Analysts said there would be no such drastic measures.
 ""We believe, as in the previous years, that the
investigation is unlikely to lead to any significant
consequences for steel names this time,"" VTB analysts wrote in a
note.

 PRICE ENVIRONMENT
 Global steel prices have risen sharply in recent months in
response to an improved demand environment and surging iron ore.
 ING analyst Maxim Matveev noted that domestic steel prices
have risen about 25 percent this year, while export prices are
up roughly 40 percent.
 ""Our estimates for example in May for Russian domestic HRC
(hot rolled coil) was $690 per tonne and export was about $740,""
he said.
 HRC is widely used in the auto sector. Russian producers
said earlier this year they wanted to raise prices for all steel
shipments to the industry by 30 percent in the second half of
the year.
 Russian Technologies head Sergei Chemezov on Tuesday said a
price increase of at most 17 percent would be fair.
 ""I don't understand where this 25-30 percent comes from,""
Chemezov told journalists.
 His company holds a 25 percent stake in Russia's largest
automaker, Avtovaz, as well as a 37.8 percent stake in the
leading truck maker, Kamaz.

735,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2010 11:51AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-Russia revives WTO bid. Will it collapse again?," By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, May 26 (Reuters) - Russia will resume talks to join
the World Trade Organisation next month, a year after suspending
them to create a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan.
 Creating the customs union proved to be more complicated
than anticipated and the three countries have postponed its
planned launch date.
 The European Union says Russia, which remains the largest
economy still outside the 153-member body, could join the WTO
within a year amid generally better ties with Brussels and
Washington.
 But as talks have been going on for the past 16 years,
experts are far from certain about the final outcome.
 The following are potential scenarios on how Russia's
long-standing bid to join the WTO may play out.

 RUSSIA SPEEDS UP WTO TALKS, DUMPS CUSTOMS UNION FOR NOW
 Russia is looking to diversify its exports away from
commodities and energy and shift trade from slow-growing
developed markets to fast-expanding emerging and frontier
markets.
WTO membership will help Russia achieve both goals,
increase the country's attractiveness to foreign investors and
facilitate new bilateral trade deals. 
 ""Many countries which are looking into trade with Russia
would like it to become a WTO member before launching bilateral
trade initiatives,"" said Yaroslav Lissovolik, Chief Economist at
Deutsche Bank. 
 Remaining obstacles include the status of Russian
state-owned enterprises, intellectual property rights and
farming subsidies.
 The WTO bid is likely to dominate a Russia-EU summit next
week and a potential summit between Presidents Dmitry Medvedev
and Barack Obama later this year.
 
 RUSSIA GOES FOR CUSTOMS UNION IF WTO CHANCES UNCLEAR
 The move would upset foreign investors, who were already
rattled when Prime Minister Vladimir Putin gave the order last
year to suspend talks with the WTO until the creation of the
customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan.
 Analysts struggled to explain Putin's move, which came at a
time when Russia was closer to joining the WTO than ever. Some
saw in it frustration at the slow pace of talks, or Moscow's
unwillingness to open its markets at the peak of the global
economic crisis.
 ""You change the rules of the game overnight and tell
everyone about it at the last minute. Russia still has a lot of
explaining to do,"" said one Moscow-based European investor.
 Russia will have to compromise on thorny issues such as
duty-free oil exports -- a demand of Belarus -- or car import
duties which help protect the Russian auto industry from foreign
second-hand vehicles.
 Belarus wants to import Russian oil duty-free, process it at
its own refineries and export oil products at a hefty profit.
 Russia, which ships 1 million barrels per day of oil to
Europe via Belarus, says it will only cover Belarus' domestic
consumption with duty-free oil supplies.
 The issue looks set to dominate a summit of the leaders of
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus on July 5.
 
 RUSSIA CREATES UNION WITH KAZAKHSTAN ONLY
 Russia may try to create a customs union with Kazakhstan
only, Russian government sources have said -- although Putin's
spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this would be the ""least desirable""
outcome.
 The economies of Russia and Kazakhstan have similar profiles
and both focus on energy, which partly explains the lack of big
differences in negotiations. The move would complicate talks
with the WTO and create only marginal economic benefits.
 It would further worsen relations between the Kremlin and
Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has recently
opposed integration with Russia amid better ties with the West
and due to what analysts say are his fears of losing control of
Belarus.
 It could also increase the likelihood of oil pricing spats
between Moscow and Minsk which have previously led to disruption
of Russian oil flows across Belarus to Germany and Poland.
 
 CLOSER UKRAINIAN TIES
 The Kremlin has invited Ukraine to join the customs union
but Kiev says the idea contradicts its WTO commitments.
 Ukraine, already a WTO member, is a larger trade partner for
Russia than Belarus and Kazakhstan. 
 After five years of chilly relations with Moscow under
Kiev's previous pro-Western leadership, relations between the
two states have improved since President Viktor Yanukovich, seen
as more loyal to the Kremlin, came to power earlier this year.
 Closer ties are unlikely to lead to Ukraine's membership in
the customs union but will rather help Russia's WTO membership
and thus facilitate trade between Moscow and Kiev.

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell for a third
straight session against the dollar on Wednesday, still
pressured by nagging fears that the European debt crisis could
hurt global growth prospects.
 Concerns about tighter dollar funding conditions, with
three-month dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month
high on Wednesday, and a surprisingly lackluster German debt
auction also weighed on the euro, analysts said.
 A surge in U.S. durable good orders and new home sales for

 Earlier, the euro suffered after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said the U.S central bank's dollar funding
facility was unlikely to last forever. That partly dimmed risk
appetite, although the impact was short-lived.
 Speaking in Tokyo, Bernanke said dollar swap lines, which
were reinstated as the Greek debt crisis escalated, played an
important role in stabilizing markets but that the Fed did not
want to provide a permanent service.
 Later on Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner will meet his new UK counterpart, George Osborne, and
Bank of England Governor Mervyn King in London before traveling

 (Adds quotes, background)
 COPENHAGEN, May 26 (Reuters) - Denmark's central bank cut
its certificate of deposit rate by 10 basis points to 0.50
percent to curb the strength of the crown, but kept its main
policy rate unchanged on Wednesday.
 The reduction came exactly a week after the Nationalbank's
last 10 bps cut in the CD rate to curb the crown.
 ""The rate reduction is a consequence of purchases of foreign
exchange in the market,"" the Nationalbank said in a statement,
using its usual formula for saying it has been intervening to
curb the crown.
 It kept its main interest rate, the lending rate, steady at
1.05 percent, but the bank trimmed its current account rate --
another secondary rate -- by 10 bps to 0.40 percent.
 Danske Bank foreign exchange analyst John Hydeskov said in a
note to clients: ""The crown has in the past few days had further
tailwind as many investors have fled to Danish shares which are
seen as a good shelter from the current financial woes in the
markets.""
 The bank changes interest rates for the sole purpose of
keeping the crown within a narrow band to the euro, but big
inflows of foreign currency into the crown have driven the
currency up in recent months.
 ""The rate cut comes just a week after the Nationalbank had
to make a similar move to reduce the benefit of holding crowns
compared with euros,"" Hydeskov said.
 ""That was apparently not enough and so now the Nationalbank
needs to again adjust its rate levels. The rate cut is no
surprise in the market,"" Hydeskov added.
 The crown was virtually unmoved by the rate cuts, trading at
7.4401 to the euro  at 1435 GMT, flat at the same
levels visited just before the announcement.
 EU member but euro zone outsider Denmark runs a
fixed-exchange-rate policy, which aims to keep the crown within
a plus/minus 2.25 percent fluctuation band around a central rate
of 7.46038 crowns to the euro. In practice the band is tighter.
 It was the 18th cut in the Nationalbank's CD rate since it
began cutting from a peak of 5.50 percent in November 2008,
though it has held the lending rate steady since mid-January
when it took the spread to the euro zone's official rate to a
record narrow 5 basis points.
 ""Today's rate cut brings Danish monetary policy closer to
euro zone monetary policy but it's not entirely there,"" Hydeskov
said.
 ""As long as rates are higher on Danish crowns there will be
a certain inflow of foreign exchange into Denmark, since the
Nationalbank has also showed they want to keep the EUR/DKK close
to or slightly below the central parity and has thereby reduced
the foreign exchange risk considerably,"" he said.
 ""The crown has in the past few days had further tailwind as
many investors have fleed to Danish shares which are seen as a
good shelter from the current financial woes in the markets,""
Hydeskov added.

 By Manuela Badawy and Sujata Rao
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Bargain-hunting lifted
U.S. stocks at the open on Wednesday, but the euro fell against
the dollar for a third straight day as U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner urged European leaders to find a unified
approach to the region's deepening debt crisis.
 The euro slid against the dollar but stayed above the 8-1/2
year lows hit on Tuesday. Oil prices rallied nearly 4 percent,
climbing back above $71 a barrel after a U.S. industry report
showed a steep drop in gasoline stockpiles. [ID:nSGE64P06D]
 ""There is still a deeply negative sentiment toward the euro
due to the debt situation in Europe, the issue with Spain over
the weekend and how investors are bracing for the possibility
that other banks in the region may follow suit and may need a
bailout,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Travelex
Global Business Payments in Washington.
 Spain took over a small savings bank, CajaSur, over the
weekend, and analysts said the move highlighted weakness in the
European banking sector.
 Since global equity markets peaked on April 15, $4.2
trillion in market value has been erased from the MSCI
all-country world stocks index. <.MIWD00000PUS>
 The index of world stocks on Wednesday rose 2.1 percent,
and emerging stocks rose 2.7 percent, partially recovering
Tuesday's 4 percent decline -- their biggest one-day fall in
over a year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 83.66
points, or 0.83 percent, at 10,127.41. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 11.04 points, or 1.03 percent, at
1,085.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 29.09
points, or 1.32 percent, at 2,240.04.
 Banks and industrial stocks, among the worst-hit issues in
the pullback, rose in early trading, with Citigroup Inc 
climbing 4.5 percent and industrial conglomerate General
Electric Co  up 3.2 percent. Citi was upgraded to
""outperform"" by analysts at Oppenheimer, which said the stock
was a good value. For details, see [ID:nSGE64P0FU]
 EURO-TALK
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner urged Europeans on
Wednesday to work for a globally consistent approach to
financial reform as the European Union said it might go it
alone with a plan to tax banks to pay for future rescues.
[ID:nSGE64P04M].
European shares <.FTEU3> rebounded by 3.1 percent from
Tuesday's nine-month lows, but the euro  remained under
pressure amid continuing signs of banks' reluctance to lend to
euro-zone counterparts exposed to south European sovereign
debt.
 The euro  dipped to $1.2222 against the dollar, down
1.21 percent on the day, according to Reuters data.
 Geithner's stress on coordination of new regulation
appeared aimed chiefly at Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
which stunned markets and angered its European Union partners
by unilaterally banning some speculative financial trades last
week. [ID:nLDE64O1HJ]
 The dollar extended gains against the euro on Wednesday
after U.S. durables goods orders rose more than expected in
April [ID:nN25139665].
 Manufacturing is leading the economy's recovery from the
worst recession since the 1930s, but consumers are now stepping
up to the plate as the labor market improves.
""We now have five quarters of increases, and that's a good
sign of transitioning from a recovery to sustainable growth,""
said John Canally, investment strategist and economist at LPL
Financial in Boston.
 ""It's too early to gauge the impact of the European crisis
... (we) probably have to wait until May or even July to see an
impact.""
 The rise in risk appetite hurt Treasuries, and the 30-year
bond  shed 36/32 in price, with its yield rising to
4.14 percent from 4.08 percent late on Tuesday. The benchmark
10-year note  was trading 25/32 lower in price to
yield 3.25 percent, up from 3.18 percent.
 While investors watched stocks, Treasuries prices were also
undermined by traders looking for price concessions ahead of
the auction of $40 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday
afternoon.
 ""Risk trades seem to be in a better mood today,"" said
Andrew Brenner, managing director at Guggenheim Partners in New
York.

 By Vuyani Ndaba
JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (Reuters) - South Africa's economy will
probably get a boost from the soccer World Cup, but the uplift
may fall short of lofty hopes when the country first got news it
would be host for the tournament, a Reuters poll showed.
 With a little over two weeks to go until kick-off, football
fever is growing in Africa's biggest economy. Spain has edged
ahead of five times world champions Brazil as the tournament
favourites, a separate poll of economists showed.
The Reuters survey of 22 economists forecasting the event
found a range of views, saying it would add between 0.1 and 0.7
percentage points to growth, with a median forecast of 0.3
percentage points, boosted by an expected 300,000 visitors.
 The South African economy is expected to expand by 4.0
percent in the second quarter and 3.9 percent in the third,
rounding off an average rate of 3.1 percent over the duration of
2010, the poll showed.
 The biggest impact is seen in the current quarter, where the
median forecast predicted a 0.5 percentage point boost to the
economy. The tournament runs for a month, from June 11.
 South Africa's economy grew by an annualised 4.6 percent in
the first quarter, beating expectations, well ahead of the 3.2
percent expansion in the fourth quarter of 2009. That was partly
due to preparations for the event.
 ""Although there will be a lasting positive effect on the
South African economy via further infrastructure development,
investment and tourism related to the World Cup, it is likely to
disappoint from initial expectations,"" Noelani King Conradie, at
NKC Independent Economists in Cape Town.
 ""The lasting effects of the global financial crisis and
South Africa's image abroad as a dangerous crime-ridden country
will be the biggest negative factors.""
 Indeed there are reasons for caution in predicting a large
boost to the economy. Germany saw a jump in retail spending and
services activity running up to and including the tournament it
hosted in 2006 but also a sharp slowdown afterward.
 ""We had some investment in infrastructure before the World
Cup, and tourists which came to Germany and a positive effect in
retailing,"" said Stefan Muetze, economist at Helaba in
Frankfurt. ""But the net effect was relatively small.""
 
 FEWER VISITORS EXPECTED
 In-depth research conducted by Grant Thornton last month
showed that 373,000 foreigners were expected to visit South
Africa for the tournament, about 230,000 of them ticket holders.
 But that was much lower than on earlier predictions of
450,000 overseas visitors and has left some economists more
sceptical about how much of a real boost it will provide.
 ""The World Cup will probably have an impact on the economy,
but by less than what was initially expected as the number of
foreign arrivals (and estimated amount spent per traveller)
looks set to fall short of expectations"" said Jean-Francois
Mercier, an economist at Citi.
 Slightly more than half of the economists polled, 12 of 22,
expected the World Cup to have a lasting impact on foreign
direct investment.
 Preparations for the World Cup, including billions of rands
spent in constructing and upgrading stadiums and the country's
transport system, helped create thousands of short-term jobs.
 ""Certain sectors like construction, hospitality and
transport will benefit but exactly quantifying the influence
will be difficult,"" said Salomi Odendaal at Citadel.
 ""The bigger impact may be on increased optimism among South
African residents because of the 'feel good' factor.""
 Economists said the tournament is not expected to have a
lasting impact on employment.
 The poll showed unemployment at a median of 25 percent of
the labour force in the third quarter, little changed from the
first quarter of this year.
 Forecasters on average expect the jobless rate to fall back
to 24.3 percent of the labour force in the last quarter of the
year compared with 25.2 percent in the first quarter.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro slid for a third
straight session against the dollar on Wednesday, still
pressured by nagging fears that the European debt crisis could
hurt global growth prospects.
 Concerns about tighter dollar funding conditions, with
three-month dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month
high on Wednesday, and a surprisingly lackluster German debt
auction also weighed on the euro, analysts said.
 Despite such a negative backdrop, the euro remains in a
narrow trading range, with a rebound in global stocks helping
limit the euro's losses. In recent weeks, the euro has become a
proxy for risk appetite, given Europe's debt crisis, rising or
falling in tandem with global stocks.
 ""There is still a deeply negative sentiment toward the euro
due to the debt situation in Europe, the issue with Spain over
the weekend and how investors are bracing for the possibility
that other banks in the region may follow suit and may need a
bailout,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Travelex
Global Business Payments in Washington.
 In early New York trading, the euro fell 0.8 percent
against the dollar to $1.2271. It recovered from a low of
$1.2172 on Tuesday when investors pulled back sharply from
riskier assets. The euro hit a trough of $1.2143 last week, its
lowest since April 2006.
 Data showing U.S. durable goods orders surged in April
further boosted the dollar against the euro.
 ""I think you have to average the last two months' worth of
durables data and it's definitely better than expected and
consistent with the economy growing at a 3 to 4 percent pace
this year,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist
at BNY Mellon in New York.
 ""The economy is unimpeded by the turmoil in Europe for now.
After the flash crash, perspectives changed, and the market was
willing to view problems in Europe as potentially dangerous for
global growth. I think that's still premature at this stage.""
 Earlier, the euro suffered after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said the U.S central bank's dollar funding
facility was unlikely to last forever. That partly dimmed risk
appetite, although the impact was short-lived.
 Speaking in Tokyo, Bernanke said dollar swap lines, which
were reinstated as the Greek debt crisis escalated, played an
important role in stabilizing markets but that the Fed did not
want to provide a permanent service.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will meet his new
UK counterpart George Osborne and Bank of England Governor
Mervyn King in London on Wednesday before traveling to
Frankfurt for dinner with European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet.
 Geithner is expected to discuss the debt crisis in Europe,
which has led to global market turmoil in the past few weeks.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
slightly at 86.833.
 Against the yen, the euro was down nearly 0.8 percent at
110.77 yen. On Tuesday, it tumbled to 108.83 on trading
platform EBS, its lowest since November 2001.
 The dollar was little changed against the yen at 90.27
yen.

 BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) - The EU's monetary affairs chief
said on Wednesday Europe faced economic stagnation and political
irrelevance if it did not carry out reforms and chided Germany
for acting alone in banning some short-selling activities.
 Olli Rehn, the European Union's commissioner for economic
and monetary affairs, said the EU was at a crossroads as it
tackled debt problems in Greece and other countries using the
euro.
 ""Either we take determined and joint action for Europe's
economic and political revival or we face economic stagnation
and political irrelevance,"" Rehn told an economic conference in
Brussels.
 He later told Reuters it was vital for most of the 16 states
in the euro zone to accelerate fiscal consolidation and praised
a 24-billion-euro ($30 billion) austerity plan announced by
Italy.
 ""These budget cuts are very significant and go in the right
direction. Such significant measures of fiscal consolidation as
decided by Italy yesterday do help restore confidence in the
euro zone,"" Rehn said.
 Confidence in the euro zone as been damaged by Greece's debt
problems and concerns that other countries such as Italy, Spain
or Portugal could face similar problems.
 The EU also faces criticism for not responding faster to the
crisis, which has damaged its global image and caused falls in
the value of the euro.
 Asked about German moves to ban some short-selling
activities, Rehn said: ""We would prefer coordinated action."" 
 ""I do understand German concerns based on their
long-standing stability-oriented culture and fiscal discipline,""
he added.
 Germany caught markets and its EU partners unawares last
week when the government's financial watchdog announced a ban on
naked short-selling of shares of Germany's top 10 financial
institutions, and of euro government bonds and related credit
default swaps.
 Naked short selling involves short selling a financial
instruments without first borrowing the security or ensuring
that the security can be borrowed.
 Germany also aims to ""regulate further points"" with a draft
law it plans to enact, a German finance ministry spokesman said
on Wednesday.
 Such moves are intended to stabilise financial markets hit
by concerns over the euro zone debt crisis.

 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Wednesday but
was off near four-year lows hit against the dollar the previous
day as equities rebounded, although sentiment remained shaky for
the single currency.
 The euro was also dented by lacklustre demand at a German
debt auction [ID:nTAR001747]. A separate auction of Portuguese
government paper that saw robust demand [ID:nLIS002381] failed
to bolster the single currency.
 Concerns about tighter dollar funding conditions, with
three-month dollar interbank rates hitting a fresh 10-month high
on Wednesday, also weighed on the euro.
 As extreme risk aversion eased, European shares <.FTEU3>
rallied 2 percent and U.S. stock futures  rose 0.8 percent
after Wall Street staged a late-day rally the previous day.
 By 1113 GMT, the euro  was 0.3 percent lower on the
day to $1.2321. It recovered from a low of $1.2172 on Tuesday
when investors pulled back sharply from riskier assets. The euro
hit a trough of $1.2143 last week, its lowest since April 2006.
 ""The market has been very short and maybe it's time for the
market to take a breather... but tentative is a good way to
describe the rebound,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at
UBS.
 Nomura currency strategist Ned Rumpeltin said the market was
in ""consolidation mode,"" and position adjustments may drive the
currency as high as $1.26 before it resumes its downtrend
towards $1.20.
 Earlier, the euro suffered after U.S. Federal Reserve

753,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2010 07:47AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Financial fears could spread through EU -UK minister," (Adds quotes, background)
 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - There is a risk that lack of
financial confidence could spread across the European Union and
affect previously untouched countries, Britain's Chief Secretary
to the Treasury David Laws said on Wednesday.
 Laws, a Liberal Democrat, holds the number two Treasury job
in a coalition government led by the Conservative Party that
took office two weeks ago. The government has announced spending
cuts worth 6 billion pounds this year to tackle the deficit.
 ""Even in this morning's news and over the last few days, we
see the very real risk that the lack of financial confidence
could spread across the European Union and could engulf even
some of those nations who have not been affected to date,"" Laws
told parliament during a question and answer session.
 Britain posted a budget deficit of 156.1 billion pounds,
close to 11 percent of GDP, for the fiscal year 2009-2010.
Financial markets have been keen to see quick and decisive
action to improve the public finances.
 In Britain's case, Laws said, ""there was a real risk had we
not acted to maintain the credibility of our fiscal policy, that
we could have seen a big rise in interest rates that would have
gobbled up additional expenditure and also helped to wreck the
recovery that is now taking place.""
 In the run-up to the May 6 election, the Liberal Democrats
argued against cutting public spending this year on the basis
that it would jeopardise a fragile recovery from the worst
recession since World War Two.
 Asked why he had changed his mind in government about the
timing of cuts, Laws said it had now become clear to him that
action was needed quickly to avoid difficulties on the markets.
 ""Anyone would know ... just how much the international
situation has worsened over the last couple of months, just how
much the sovereign debt risk means that countries that are seen
not to be taking action on their public finances are at risk of
having an adverse reaction in the international markets,"" he
said.
 ""Had we had that, the consequence inevitably of that loss of
confidence would have been difficulty in auctioning the gilts
that we have to sell to fund this deficit,"" he said.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro slipped across the board
on Wednesday, prodded lower after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke highlighted the possibility that the U.S central bank's
dollar funding facility would not last forever.
 The single currency trimmed losses as European shares
rallied, but its recovery was dashed after a poorly received
German debt auction underlined overall negative sentiment on the
euro zone.
 Speaking in Tokyo, Bernanke said dollar swap lines, which
were reinstated as a Greek debt crisis escalated, played an
important role in stabilising markets, but that the Fed did not
want to provide a permanent service.
While many in the market acknowledge the funding cushion is
temporary, analysts said Bernanke's comments were keeping risk
aversion high and helping to keep sentiment negative on the
euro, which hovered near a four-year low versus the dollar.
""There seems to be scepticism in the market about how long
or how large swap facilities will continue to be,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
""The possibility of a test of the downside level in
euro/dollar is more strong than a test of the upside,"" he added.
 Signs of tighter funding, with costs for banks to borrow
dollars in the interbank market hitting 10-month highs this
week, are driving investors to the relative safety of U.S.
dollars, away from risky assets and currencies.
 This has been driven by uncertainty about how debt problems
in Greece and other euro zone countries will impact the global
economy.
 Traders said weak demand at an offer of five-year German
government bonds on Wednesday was keeping the euro under selling
pressure.
 By 1003 GMT, the euro had slipped 0.4 percent on the day to
$1.2315, having hit a session trough of $1.2263. A fall below
$1.2143 touched last week would mark its weakest since April
2006.
 Short covering since last week has kept the euro away from
that level, and Nomura currency strategist Ned Rumpeltin said
position adjustments may drive the currency as high as $1.26
before it resumes its downtrend towards $1.20.
 ""We're in a consolidation mode. While additional negative
developments can spark another wave of risk aversion at any
time, we're looking for a few more days of letting the market
catch its breath,"" he said.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.5 percent at 111.13 yen
. On Tuesday, it tumbled to 108.83 yen on trading platform EBS,
its lowest since November 2001.
 The euro recovered from the day's low versus the dollar and
the yen as European shares rallied 2 percent and U.S. stock
futures rose 0.6 percent.
 Some analysts said equity moves reflected short covering
following recent losses, rather than improving risk demand.
 Higher-risk currencies including sterling and the Australian
and New Zealand dollars slipped against the U.S. currency, but
trimmed losses as stocks rose. This nudged the dollar 0.1
percent lower versus a currency basket to 86.684.
 Market participants say credit tightness has been less
severe than was seen after the Lehman shock in 2008.
 But fresh memories of the global credit crunch are making
financial institutions cautious about lending to those who may
have big exposure to debt-ridden countries or banks in the euro
zone, traders say.
 The Bank of Spain's weekend takeover of savings bank CajaSur
kept investors determined to cut risky trades as the move fanned
fears more banks may need to be bailed out by euro zone members.

 * UK's Osborne pleased that EU states back bank levy

(Updates after news conference)
 By Glenn Somerville and Sumeet Desai
 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Europe has the right ideas to
solve its fiscal crisis and now needs to put them into practice
to calm markets, U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said on
Wednesday.
 But he also once again stressed the need for a common
approach to financial regulation, seemingly a swipe at Germany
which has gone it alone on banning certain types of
speculatative trading.
 Geithner was in London at the start of a 2-day European tour
to press the case for greater international cooperation and
discuss the latest in the crisis spreading through southern
Europe, which is sapping global investor confidence.
 ""The European leaders have put together a very strong
programme of reforms on the fiscal side and a very strong
commitment on the financial side,"" he said at a news conference
alongside new British finance minister George Osborne.
 ""I think it's got the right elements and again I see a very
strong political commitment -- you see that not just in Germany
but across Europe -- to make it work. I think what Europe should
do is implement the program they've laid out.""
 Osborne said that it was in both countries' interests to see
stability in the euro zone.
 Policymakers in Washington and London have been dismayed by
how far the Greek crisis has spread to the rest of the euro zone
and once again put the entire world banking system under threat
due to what some say was a lack of decisive and early action.
 It was the U.S. Treasury that initiated this month's G7
emergency conference calls that led to a $1 trillion EU/IMF
rescue package but there is rising concern that this may not
have been enough and markets are still falling sharply.
 The message from Geithner was that it needed time to work.
""It's a good programme (and) has got the right elements. What
markets want to see is action,"" he said.
 ""The basic lesson from the U.S. crisis is that you have got
to act quickly and with force.""
 
 GERMAN CONCERN
 Geithner also affirmed America's ""special relationship"" with
Britain after his meeting with Osborne, the first since the
latter took office two weeks ago in London's new
Conservative/Liberal Democrat coaltion government.
 The Treasury Secretary, a former Federal Reserve policymaker
himself, is also meeting with Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King before he flies to Frankfurt for dinner with European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet.
 He then goes on to Berlin to meet his German counterpart
Wolfgang Schaeuble. 
 Geithner said he was not here to tell Europe what to do but
Washington is clearly irked by Germany's decision to impose a
unilateral ban of naked short selling -- the practice of selling
instruments which are neither owned or borrowed -- of some
securities.
 He said that he and Osborne had discussed a common approach
to regulation ahead of next month's meeting of G20 finance
ministers in Korea and leaders in Canada.
 Osborne said he was happy that other European states agreed
on the need for a bank levy to fund the cost of future bailouts,
and reiterated Britain's position that the funds raised should
be treated as general taxation rather than saved until a crisis
happens. [ID:nDE64P13E]

 * Sees commodities as best exposure to emerging economies
 By Kevin Lim
 SINGAPORE, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro will continue to
fall and interest rates will stay low as European governments
slash spending and economic growth lags other parts of the
world, according to a global macro fund manager at Legg Mason.
 ""We think the euro will continue to weaken,"" investment
director Ajay Dayal said at the Singapore launch of the Legg
Mason Permal Global Absolute Fund, which aims to provide annual
returns of 8-10 percent regardless of how markets perform.
 The other main assumptions driving the fund's investments
are that developed economies will not raise rates as quickly as
the market expects and that commodities are the best way to bet
on continued strong growth in emerging economies, he said.
 The euro has fallen by over 20 percent against the dollar
since the start of this year, and Dayal said there could be
further downside given Europe's growing debt burden and
likelihood of new problems emerging on the continent.
 ""If another European bank goes down or if another European
country goes down, we might decide to hold on a little bit
longer,"" he said, adding the fund currently has relatively
large short positions on both the euro and the yen.
 Dayal said the fund is invested in 1-3 year U.S. and
European government bonds via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as
it does not expect their central banks to raise rates anytime
soon.
 As for emerging markets, the fund is tapping the growth
through exposure to commodities and an ETF that track the
stocks of global consumer staple firms such as Tyson Foods.
 The Legg Mason Permal Global Absolute Fund, which is aimed
at retail investors, returned 2.67 percent between the start of
2010 and end-April, and is up 3.45 percent since it was set up
about seven months ago.
 Legg Mason launched the fund in Singapore on Wednesday and
plans to offer it to retail investors in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
 According to data from Legg Mason and Lipper, a unit of
Thomson Reuters, the Global Absolute Fund is about 20 percent
invested in 1-3 year U.S. and European government bonds.
 The fund's other large holdings include gold, hedge funds
with macro and event-driven strategies, and an ETF that tracks
dollar-denominated corporate bonds.
 The fund increased its cash holdings from about 1 percent
at end-March to 15 percent at end-April, and its exposure to
European equities fell to zero from 5.1 percent at the end of
last year.
 Dayal said Legg Mason favoured Japanese and frontier market
equities because they have become cheap relative to stocks
elsewhere following a correction in global markets.
 ""Japanese companies have cut cost, they are still as
efficient as before and they are cash-rich,"" he said.

24 billion euros of deficit-reducing cuts that target public
workers and local government and could hit the popularity of
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
 The cabinet approved the measures on Tuesday night and they
will be outlined at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.
 There have been reports of friction between Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi and his Treasury Minister Giulio Tremonti,
with Berlusconi wanting less severe cuts and Tremonti taking a
harder line.
 Here are brief excerpts from editorial comments about the
cuts in Wednesday newspapers:
 IL SOLE 24 ORE: ""It is no mystery that these dramatic budget
cuts are being born under the sign of Giulio Tremonti and not
under that of Silvio Berlusconi ... the long season of
Berlusconi-style optimism, with its corollary of carefree
attitudes and cheap faith is over.""
 LA REPUBBLICA: ""It is a budget that wants to take in as much
money in the least possible time, without worrying about
reaching long-term savings or thinking about growth. It seeks to
reassure the markets but it risks giving the image of a country
with a gas tube in its mouth.""
 CORRIERE DELLA SERA: ""Tremonti (had let it be known) that
the situation is on the edge and how irritated he is by the
protests that his budget is causing. Even though it is
considered obligatory because of the European crisis, it is not
guaranteed that it will be enough to stop financial speculation
... as watered-down as it may be, the budget will make someone
unhappy.""
 LA STAMPA: ""There is no doubt that it will be the harshest
and most severe budget of any Berlusconi government. It will
also be one of the few budgets with real spending cuts.""

 * Avoiding excess capital inflows is key challenge
 * Cuts inflation rate fcast to 6.5 pct in 2010 vs 6.9 pct
 * Sees budget deficit shrinking to 5.1 pct of GDP

 PARIS, May 26 (Reuters) - Russia's oil-fuelled economic
recovery poses a risk of a new boom-and-bust cycle should oil
prices and capital inflows continue to increase, the OECD said
on Wednesday.
 The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development raised its growth forecast for Russia to 5.5 percent
this year from a November forecast of 4.9 percent, citing a
recovery in oil prices since early 2009.
 ""If oil prices and capital inflows continue to increase,
avoiding excesses will be the main policy challenge,"" the OECD
said in its latest Economic Outlook.
 According to official data, the economy grew 2.9 percent in
the first quarter of 2010, year-on-year [ID:nLAG006285].
 The OECD said that the main risk for Russia has shifted from
relapsing into a recession to another excessive boom as trade
and private capital inflows pick up, as in the run-up to the
financial crisis.
 Russia saw GDP growth of above 6 percent in the years
preceding the crisis, fuelled in part by massive short-term
inflows reaching a record high of $82.3 billion in 2007.
 However, once the global financial crisis began the funds
fled the country leaving the rouble to lose nearly a third of
its value within a few months in late 2008 as the country headed
for its first recession in a decade.
The rouble has recovered from heavy losses since then on the
back of strong oil prices but came under renewed pressure this
month as prices for Russian Urals crude  fell close to
the key threshold of $65, below which many positive fundamentals
-- such as the current account surplus -- will be erased.
 
 SHRINKING BUDGET DEFICIT
 The OECD said that the rise in commodity prices over the
past year and higher corporate earnings have improved the
outlook for balancing Russia's budget. 
 It revised its budget deficit forecast for this year to 5.1
percent of the GDP from an earlier 6.0 percent for this year.
Next year, the deficit should shrink even more to 2.2 percent,
versus previous estimates of 3.0 percent.
 Russia's government aims to rid itself of the deficit by
2015, but Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said this month that if
oil prices remained above $70 a barrel, the budget might be
balanced earlier [ID:nLDE64H0CC].
 The government should save windfall revenue and could
withdraw demand-boosting measures, such as the incentives for
new car purchases, sooner than earlier planned, the OECD said.
 ""Strong fiscal consolidation in the upswing would also help
take the pressure off monetary policy, which is likely to be
faced with a sharper trade-off between managing capital inflows
and bringing down inflation as a number of favourable factors
for inflation fade,"" the OECD.
 The OECD has cut its earlier inflation rate forecast to 6.5
percent for this year, from the earlier 6.9 percent but would
rise to 7.1 percent in 2011.
 ""The pick-up in domestic demand, coming at the same time as
the recovery in global trade volumes and combined with the
strong real appreciation of the rouble over the past year, will
push import volumes up strongly,"" the OECD said.

"
763,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2010 04:48AM ET</span>",Germany must cut spending as deficit deepens -OECD," PARIS, May 26 (Reuters) - Germany needs to cut spending to
consolidate a budget balance that is set to deteriorate markedly
in 2010, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) said on Wednesday.
 Berlin's deficit is expected to widen to over 5 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP) this year, partly due to tax cuts
introduced by Chancellor Angela Merkel's new government at the
start of 2010, the Paris-based organisation said.
 That was in line with the government's own forecast.
 ""When choosing options for consolidation going forward,
priority should be given to expenditure cuts and reductions in
tax expenditures, rather than tax increases,"" the OECD said in
its twice-yearly Economic Outlook.
 Earlier this month, Merkel ruled out further tax cuts for
2011 and 2012 due to a tight budget situation, effectively
abandoning one of the main platforms of her coalition deal.
 The government wanted to implement the tax cuts to stimulate
the economy, Europe's largest, which emerged last year from its
deepest recession since World War Two.
 The OECD said the underlying growth momentum in Germany was
intact, although it had slowed over the winter months due to ""a
significantly negative contribution from stock-building"" and
adverse weather conditions.
 ""Growth is expected to pick up strongly from the second
quarter onwards as the improvement in world trade continues and
firms gradually raise their investment expenditures,"" it said.
 ""In 2011, both private consumption and investment are
expected to return to past positive growth trends.""
 Recent economic indicators have beaten forecasts, with
industrial output and orders surging in March, while exports
rose at their fastest rate in nearly 18 years, surpassing even
the most optimistic predictions.
 Downside risks to growth were the development in world
trade, as exports continued to be Germany's growth motor, and
the robustness of the banking sector, the OECD said. However, if
the labour market proved more resilient than expected, private
consumption could rise, boosting the economy.
 German unemployment fell far more than expected in April,
declining for a 10th consecutive month, and the Economy Minister
and analysts have spoken of a ""job miracle"". [ID:nLDE63S0SF]
 ""The labour market continues to be exceptionally robust
given the magnitude of the output contraction,"" said the OECD,
forecasting the jobless rate to rise to 7.6 percent in 2010 from
7.4 percent last year, and to hit 8.0 percent in 2011.
 ""Nevertheless labour hoarding has left some enterprises with
excess employment and some increase in layoffs and in
unemployment is expected,"" the think tank said.

764,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2010 04:47AM ET</span>",OECD sees BRIC economies powering ahead in 2010-11," PARIS, May 26 (Reuters) - China, India, Brazil and Russia are powering
ahead, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on
Wednesday, revising upwards its growth outlook for all four largest emerging
economies.
 The Paris-based OECD said overheating was becoming a problem in China and
called for some increase in interest rates and ""ideally"" a greater exchange rate
flexibility.
 With the expected rebound of agricultural output in India, growth should be
strong in the near term while inflationary pressures would also remain high amid
strong outlook for demand.
 Russia should use windfall oil revenues to eliminate fiscal deficits more
quickly but if oil prices and capital inflows continue to increase rapidly the
country would face another boom-and-bust cycle.
 In Brazil, infrastructure investment will help lift growth again despite
tighter monetary policies and the beginning of spending cuts.
 Following is a summary of what the OECD said about non-members Brazil,
India, China and Russia in its latest Economic Outlook released on Wednesday.
 
 CHINA
 2008 2009 2010 2011
GDP 9.6 8.7 11.1 9.7
INFLATION (CPI) 5.9 -0.7 2.5 2.5
CURRENT ACCOUNT (pct of GDP) 9.4 6.1 2.8 3.4
FISCAL BALANCE (pct of GDP) 1.0 -0.9 1.0 1.6

 In its previous forecast in November, the OECD had projected GDP growth of
10.2 percent this year and 9.3 percent in 2011
 It said growth would slow slightly next year as the impact of the stimulus
package diminishes.
 ""With the terms of trade deteriorating and domestic demand remaining strong,
the current account surplus may continue to fall sharply in 2010... With food
prices easing, inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued,"" it said.
 ""Overheating has recently started to become more of a risk. Measures have
been taken to cool the property market but it is important to continue to move
towards a more neutral monetary policy stance.
 ""This would involve some increase in interest rates and, ideally, greater
flexibility in the exchange rate regime in order to allow a gradual appreciation
of the renminbi against a basket of currencies,"" the report said.
INDIA
 2008 2009 2010 2011
GDP (calendar year basis) 6.2 5.6 8.2 8.5
INFLATION (WPI) 8.4 4.0 8.1 6.3
CURRENT ACCOUNT (pct of GDP) -2.4 -3.0 -2.3 -2.8
FISCAL BALANCE (pct of GDP) -7.3 -11.4 -10.8 -9.5
 The OECD had forecast growth of 7.3 percent this year and 7.6 percent in
2011 in its previous report.
 ""With agricultural output expected to rebound sharply, economic growth
should be strong in the near term before moderating to around trend rates,"" it
said.
 ""The expected rebound in agricultural activity should help limit further
increases in food prices, which have been a major contributor to recent high
inflation.""
 But it said that underlying inflationary pressures are likely to persist
given the strong outlook for demand. 
 
BRAZIL
 2008 2009 2010 2011
GDP 5.1 -0.2 6.5 5.0
INFLATION (WPI) 5.9 4.3 6.2 5.0
CURRENT ACCOUNT (pct of GDP) -1.7 -1.5 -2.8 -2.6
FISCAL BALANCE (pct of GDP) -1.9 -3.3 -0.8 -0.9

 The OECD had been forecasting GDP growth of 4.8 percent in 2010 and 4.5
percent for 2011 for Brazil in its previous report.
 ""Domestic demand could slow somewhat in coming quarters given a tighter
monetary stance,"" it said. ""Subsequently, infrastructure investment will help
lift growth anew.""
 ""The remaining monetary stimulus injected during the global
crisis should now be rapidly withdrawn""
 ""Withdrawal of fiscal stimulus as soon as possible would be
advisable, the recent announcement of spending cuts to the 2010 budget is a
welcome move in this direction"".
 RUSSIA
 2008 2009 2010 2011
GDP 5.6 -7.9 5.5 5.1
INFLATION (WPI) 14.1 11.7 6.5 7.1
CURRENT ACCOUNT (pct of GDP) 6.0 3.8 7.0 5.3
FISCAL BALANCE (pct of GDP) 4.8 -6.2 -5.1 -2.2
 The OECD had forecast Russia's GDP growth at 4.9 percent in 2010 and 4.2 in
2011 and said the growth had been aided by the rise in oil prices since early
2009.
 ""The unexpectedly strong recovery should be used to eliminate the fiscal
deficit more quickly than previously planned. 
 ""Windfall revenues should be saved and fiscal measures to support demand
phased out more quickly. As the effects of the crisis fade, longer-term policy
priorities should be
brought to the fore.""

 * Inflation, fiscal tightening will subdue growth in 2010
 * Uncertainty means fiscal outlook may be worse than thought
 
 By Peter Griffiths
 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Britain's new coalition
government must announce a strong and credible medium-term plan
to cut its record budget deficit or risk driving up inflation
and damaging the recovery, a thinktank said on Wednesday.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) said policymakers will have to balance the fragile state
of the economy with the need to maintain credibility when they
decide on the pace of cuts.
 ""A concrete and far-reaching consolidation plan needs to be
announced upfront,"" it said in a report on the economic outlook.
""A weak fiscal position and the risk of significant increases in
bond yields make further fiscal consolidation essential.""
 Britain has a budget deficit running at 11 percent of GDP
and is emerging from its worst recession since the war. The
government will set out its spending plans in an emergency
budget on June 22 after announcing a first stage of cuts on
Monday. [ID:nLDE64N0X4]
 The Paris-based thinktank, funded by 30 countries including
Britain, said UK policymakers face ""substantial challenges"" over
fiscal decisions, particularly as estimates of the loss of
output during the economic crisis are highly uncertain.
 If bond yields rise faster than expected or inflation edges
further above its 2 percent target, Britain may need to take
tougher measures to maintain credibility.
 ""The underlying fiscal position could be even worse and
inflation pressures would build up quicker than expected,
forcing swifter and more dramatic policy tightening,"" it said.
 The planned fiscal contraction amounts to 2 percent of GDP
between 2009 and 2011. Fiscal deficits are projected to stay
above 10 percent of GDP in 2010-11 and gross public debt is
expected to rise to 86 percent of GDP in 2010-11, the OECD said.
 Fiscal tightening, high inflation and the effects of the
credit crunch will subdue growth in 2010.
 However, rising global demand for Britain's exports and
sterling's weakness will underpin the recovery in 2010-11, the
survey said. After a weak 2010, stronger household consumption
and rising business investment should bolster the recovery.
 Unemployment will bottom out in the second part of 2010
before slowly picking up during 2011, the report said.
 As the recovery gathers pace, the Bank of England should end
the period of ultra-low interest rates during the second half of
2010. Rates have stood at 0.5 percent since March 2009 and the
central bank has spent 200 billion pounds ($286.1 billion) on an
asset-buying scheme to help the economy.

 * Euro off Tuesday's lows but still weak 
 * Investors still inclined to reduce risk exposure
 
 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Bargain-hunting lifted world
stocks on Wednesday off the previous session's nine-month lows
while the euro pared some losses but was capped by a poorly
received German bond sale.
 Buying kicked in on stocks after global indices hit their
lowest levels since last August this week, and Wall Street also
looked set to open on a firm note.
 The MSCI index of world stocks rose 1 percent
<.MIWD00000PUS> after falling 1.8 percent on Tuesday while
emerging stocks rose 2.2 percent, partially recovering Tuesday's
4 percent decline -- their biggest one-day fall in over a year.
 The euro was down on the day but above lows hit on Tuesday
while the oil price rallied nearly 3 percent, climbing back
above $70 a barrel after a U.S. industry report showed a steep
drop in gasoline stockpiles. [ID:nSGE64P06D]
 Financial markets remained jittery, however, and investors
still appeared inclined to reduce risk exposure because of tough
financing conditions in the euro zone that are fuelling fears
the slowdown in credit will hit the banking sector.
 Tightening U.S. banking regulation and talk of war on the
Korean peninsula are also weighing on risk appetite, which means
equity gains could prove fleeting.
 ""We are technically very oversold so we expect to see a
bounce in the market,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research
at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. 
 ""But the longer-term picture is still quite challenging ...
Italy has just made cuts to its budget which mean the economy
will be put under severe pressure for quite some time.""
 By 1120 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
European shares was up 2 percent, recouping almost all of the
the previous session's losses.
 Banks rose the most, with British banks Lloyds Banking Group
 and Royal Bank of Scotland  up 5-6 percent and
the rebound in energy and commodity prices boosted mining and
oil firms.
 U.S. stock futures were higher. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures
  rose 0.7 percent each while Dow Jones 
futures were up 0.5 percent by 1120 GMT. 
 However, close to $4 trillion has been wiped off the MSCI
world stocks index since April 15 and many investors expect
selling to resume once the bargain hunters step away.
""I don't interpret (higher shares) as a sign that risk
appetite is coming back to the market,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann,
currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 
 MONEY MARKETS
 Leuchtmann said he expects more weakness in the euro.
 By 1113 GMT, the single currency  was 0.3 percent
lower on the day at $1.2321 but up from Tuesday's low of
$1.2172.
 However, it remains near a four-year low against the dollar
and upside was dampened by a poorly received German bond auction
that underscored the euro zone's problems.
 ""The market has been very short and maybe it's time for the
market to take a breather ... but tentative is a good way to
describe the rebound,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at
UBS.
One key sign of continued stress comes from the money market
where short-term dollar funding costs are rising, sparking
memories of the fallout from the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse.
 The three-month Libor dollar rate  is currently
at the highest since last July and is expected to rise almost 20
basis points more over the next four weeks, according to a
Reuters poll of analysts. [ID: nLDE64P0FI]
 In 2008 it was a breakdown in trust between counterparties
that led to dollar hoarding and a lending freeze. This time
investors have been spooked by the rush out of euros and fears
that last weekend's takeover of a small Spanish savings bank by
the central bank might be an omen of more widespread problems in
the European banking sector.
 Fears of a funding crunch grew further after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke highlighted that the U.S. central bank's
dollar funding facility would not last forever. The Fed had
reopened dollar swap lines when the Greek crisis was escalating.
 Meanwhile on bond markets, U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds
slipped as the safe-haven bid eased and the disappointing German
bond auction weighed. [ID: nLDE64P19S]
 Ten-year U.S. Treasury note futures  were down 0.5
percent after hitting a one-year high on Tuesday. On the cash
market, 10-year yields rose 6.9 basis points to 3.23 percent
.
 Bund futures  slipped 0.4 percent to 128.88.

767,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2010 04:39AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-FACTBOX-What's in Italy's austerity package?," By Gavin Jones
 ROME, May 26 (Reuters) - Italy's cabinet approved an
austerity package on Tuesday to cut the deficit by 25 billion
euros in 2011 and 2012 with the aim of lowering it to 2.7
percent of gdp in 2012 from 5.3 percent last year.
 Here are some key measures of the 54-article plan, which
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said was based largely on
spending cuts and a crackdown on tax evasion and welfare fraud. 
 
 SPENDING CUTS
 * Cuts in funding to city and regional governments. Economy
Minister Giulio Tremonti said these would amount to 4.5 billion
euros per year, which he classified as ""substantial but not
unsustainable"".
 * Three-year freeze on public sector pay rises.
 * Cuts for three years in public sector hiring, replacing
only one employee for every five who leave.
 * Progressive pay cuts of up to 10 percent for high earners
in the public sector, including ministers and parliamentarians.
 * Delays of three months or six months in retirement for
those who reach retirement age in 2011.
 * Indexing of retirement age to average national life
expectancy from 2015.
 * 10 percent cut per year in 2011 and 2012 in spending by
all government ministries. 
 * Abolition of provincial governments of areas with fewer
than 220,000 inhabitants.
 * Elimination of 27 publicly-funded institutions, including
ISAE, which conducts Italy's consumer and business confidence
surveys. ISAE's tasks will pass to the economy ministry.
 
 REVENUE-RAISING
 * Partial amnesty for people with houses they have not
declared to the authorities.
 * A crackdown on tax evasion and false benefit claims.
 This includes:
 -- 100,000 checks per year in 2010, rising to 200,000 in
2011 and 2012 on claims for invalidity pensions.
 -- A ban on cash payments for sums above 5,000 euros,
lowering the ceiling from a previous level of 12,500 euros.
 * Tightening tax on stock options and bonuses, in line with
G20 guidelines.
 
 INCENTIVES FOR COMPETITIVENESS
 * Tax breaks for companies investing in Italy's
underdeveloped south.
 * Measures to link salary increases to rises in
productivity, in a bid to eliminate Italy's widening
competitiveness gap with major EU partners.
 * Allowing foreign companies investing in Italy to apply the
tax regime of any European Union country.
 * Creation of ""zero bureaucracy"" zones in southern Italy
which will cut down on red tape.
 
 WHEN WILL THE MEASURES TAKE EFFECT?
 The vast majority will take effect in 2011. A few will be
brought forward to 2010.
 
 WHAT ARE ITALY'S MOST RECENT ECONOMIC FORECASTS?
 Following are the government's multi-year targets issued on
May 6. Previous forecasts, issued in January, are in brackets.

 2010 2011 2012
GDP 1.0% (1.1%) 1.5% (2.0%) 2.0% (2.0%)
DEFICIT/GDP 5.0% (5.0%) 3.9% (3.9%) 2.7% (2.7%)
DEBT/GDP 118.4% (116.9%) 118.7% (116.5%) 117.2% (114.6%)
PRIMARY BALANCE* -0.4% (-0.1%) 1.0% (1.3%) 2.5% (2.7%)
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 8.7% (8.4%) na (8.3%) 8.2% (8.0%)
TAX/GDP RATIO 42.8% 42.4% 42.3%
 *excludes debt servicing costs
 
 HOW URGENT IS DEFICIT REDUCTION FOR ITALY?
 Italy has been spared the worst of the market volatility
since Greece's debt crisis exploded, thanks mainly to the
cautious fiscal policy of Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti,
meaning it is now under less pressure to adopt draconian cuts.
 Italy shunned large-scale stimulus during the recession of
2008 and 2009 and its deficit, at a projected 5 percent of GDP
in 2010, rose far less than in Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland
or Britain, which are all in or close to double digits.
 However Italy remains vulnerable due to its massive public
debt of around 118 percent of GDP. Markets and ratings agencies
want evidence that recent rises in the debt can be reversed
through structural deficit cuts and pro-growth policies.
 
 ARE THE MEASURES SURE TO BE APPROVED?
 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has an ample parliamentary
majority, meaning that in theory there should be little threat
of the package not being approved.
 However, Italy's largest trade union, the left-wing CGIL,
has already attacked the budget for unfairly hitting the poorest
Italians hardest. It announced on Wednesday that it would
propose a four-hour general strike in June in protest.
 Berlusconi's popularity has been dropping for months due to
coalition bickering, corruption scandals and a growing awareness
of the size of deficit cuts needed.
 There is a risk that discontent over the cuts could increase
government instability, raise the chance of early elections or
even lead Berlusconi to row back on some of the measures.
 However, senior members of the Berlusconi's centre-right
coalition, including the leader of the pro-autonomy Northern
League Umberto Bossi, have defended the measures as necessary.

crisis.
 ""I'm going to meet the new UK government to prepare for the

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell across the board,
closing in on a four-year low against the dollar after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke highlighted the possibility that
its dollar funding facility would not last forever.
 Speaking in Tokyo, Bernanke said dollar swap lines, which
were reinstated as the Greek debt crisis escalated, played an
important role in stabilising markets, but that the Fed did not
want to provide a permanent service. [ID:nTOE64P01H]
While many in the market already acknowledge the funding
cushion will not last forever, analysts said Bernanke's comments
were keeping risk aversion high and helping to drive the euro
lower.
""There seems to be scepticism in the market about how long
or how large swap facilities will continue to be,"" said Ulrich
Leuchtmann, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
""The possibility of a test of the downside level in
euro/dollar is more strong than a test of the upside,"" he added.
 Signs of tighter funding, with costs for banks to borrow
dollars in the interbank market soaring to 10-month highs, are
driving investors to the relative safety of the U.S. dollar and
away from riskier assets and currencies.
 This stampede has been driven by uncertainty about how debt
problems in Greece and other euro zone countries will impact the
wider global economy.
 By 0748 GMT, the euro  had fallen 0.6 percent on the
day to $1.2290 by 0727 GMT, hovering near the day's low around
$1.2263. A fall below the $1.2143 level touched last week would
mark its weakest since April 2006.
 Against the yen, it was down 0.7 percent at 110.80 yen
. On Tuesday, it tumbled to 08.83 yen on trading
platform EBS, its lowest since November 2001.
 Also keeping the euro under selling pressure were comments
from OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan, who on Wednesday
said a drop in the currency's value should help offset the toll
that austerity measures take on euro zone economic growth.
 ""The weak euro, in the short- to medium-term, is a welcome
development,"" he told Reuters in an interview. [ID:nLDE64O1OG]
Higher-risk currencies including sterling and the Australian
and New Zealand dollars each fell more than half a percent
against the U.S. currency, helping to prod the dollar 0.1
percent higher versus a currency basket <.DXY.>
 Currency traders brushed off a rally in European shares
<.FTEU3>, and analysts said higher equities were being driven by
short covering after recent losses, rather than a return of risk
appetite.
 Highlighting the tight funding situation, U.S. two-year swap
spreads , a key gauge of financial system stress,
expanded to their widest in a year on Tuesday. They eased
somewhat on Wednesday, but are still about 6 basis points wider
for the week. [ID:nLDE64O1MP]
 Market participants acknowledge that credit tightness has
been much less severe than was seen after the Lehman shock in
2008.
 But fresh memories of the global credit crunch are making
financial institutions cautious about lending to those who may
have big exposure to debt-ridden countries or banks in the euro
zone, traders say.
 The Bank of Spain's takeover of struggling regional savings
bank CajaSur at the weekend kept investors determined to cut
risky trades as it underlined weakness in the euro zone and
fanned fears that more banks may need to be bailed out by euro
zone members.

 ""We should join the euro zone when European economy expands

 ""And today, when we have a faster growth pace, it's the

hold for now and was cautiously monitoring the debt crisis.
 In the interview with Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, Komorowski
also said he hoped to name a candidate for a new central bank
governor before the presidential election set for June 20.

 * Tighter funding seen supporting demand for dollar
 * Month-end selling by Japanese exporters weighs on euro/yen
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday,
slipping back towards a four-year low against the dollar and an 8
1/2-year trough against the yen as concerns about the health of
the euro zone's banking sector weigh on the single currency.
 Signs of tighter funding, with costs for banks to borrow
dollars in the interbank market soaring to 10-month highs, are
driving investors to the relative safety of the U.S. dollar and
away from riskier assets and currencies, traders said.
 U.S. two-year swap spreads, a key gauge of financial system
stress, also widened to one-year highs on Tuesday. They slipped
off that peak on Wednesday, but are still about 6 basis points
wider for the week.
 ""Nothing has changed since yesterday. The money market strain
is there,"" said a FX trader at a Japanese trust bank. ""That is
making players in the currency market very nervous and reluctant
to take risks.""
 Month-end selling from Japanese exporters helped drag the
euro lower against the yen, traders said.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.2285, staying above Tuesday's
low of $1.2177, which was not far from a four-year low of $1.2143
struck last week.
 The euro has lost over 7 percent against the dollar so far
this month and is heading for its biggest monthly fall since
January 2009.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent against the yen to 110.79 yen. The
European single currency fell as low as 108.83 yen on Tuesday on
trading platform EBS, its lowest since late November 2001.
 Traders said credit tightness had been much less severe than
was seen after the Lehman shock in 2008.
 But fresh memories of the global credit crunch are making
financial institutions cautious about lending to those who may
have big exposure to debt-ridden countries or banks in the euro
zone, they said.
 The Bank of Spain said on Saturday it had taken over a small
savings bank, CajaSur. Analysts said the move highlighted
weakness in the European banking sector and heightened worries
that more banks in the euro zone may need to be bailed out. That
is likely to see more investors fleeing the euro.
 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a
basket of six currencies, edged up 0.1 percent to 86.844.
 Against the yen, the dollar stood at 90.19 yen, little moved
from late on Tuesday in New York.
 Investors generally flock to the yen and the U.S. dollar when
risk aversion and volatility spikes.
 JAPANESE MARGIN TRADERS
 ""The best hope for stability will come when cyclical exposure
has been wound down, but the latest IMM and Japanese retail data
suggest that these liquidations have further to run,"" JP Morgan
said in a report.
 Data suggests the recent sell-off in growth-linked currencies
is likely to run further.
 JP Morgan said the latest data from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show long positions in the Australian dollar
and the Mexican peso have fallen by two-thirds. For the Canadian
dollar they have fallen by only half.
 In addition, Japanese margin traders' net long positions in
the Australian dollar have touched a record high this month.
 Tensions on the Korean peninsula are also likely to keep
traders away from the Australian dollar, which is hugely
leveraged to the Asian growth story.
 The Aussie dollar fell 0.4 percent to $0.8236, having earlier
rallied from a 10-month low of $0.8066 hit on Tuesday.
 Against the Japanese currency, the Australian dollar fell 0.8
percent to 74.25 yen.
 A trader at a major Australian bank said some Japanese
investors sold the Aussie in early Asian trade.
 At the same time, Japanese margin traders were looking for a
chance to hunt bargains in the Australian dollar, which was
likely to limit its slide, said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of
the foreign securities department at Okasan Securities.

cut the rate it charges the European Central Bank for dollar
swaps to spur the flow of dollars to banks in Europe if strains
from the European debt crisis increase, the Wall Street Journal
reported on Tuesday.
 Officials at the Fed Board of Governors in Washington and
the New York Federal Reserve Bank declined to comment on the
newspaper's report, which did not source the information.
 Financial markets were awash with rumors on Tuesday that
the Fed and ECB could take further steps to bolster market
liquidity in Europe, which some market participants speculated
could be lower swap rates.
 The Fed charges 1 percentage point above the Overnight
Indexed Swap (OIS) rate, an index of anticipated central bank
rates, for transactions using the swap lines.
 Hundreds of billions of dollars flowed through the Fed's
dollar swap lines during the global financial crisis.
 St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard
earlier on Tuesday said the Fed's newly reopened currency swap
lines with European central banks had seen scant use to date,
evidence that current financial strains pale in comparison to
the market turmoil in late 2008.
 The Wall Street Journal said, without attribution, that the
Fed could cut the interest rate to encourage more borrowing and
ease some of the financial strain on foreign banks in need of
dollars.
 With worries rising that the European debt crisis could
lead to another financial market freeze like in 2007-2009, the
Fed may consider cutting the cost of using the swap lines as ""a
primary option,"" the Journal said.

 By Kevin Plumberg
 HONG KONG, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Wednesday
driven by fears that Europe's debt woes can wreak havoc in its
banks, though Asian stocks rebounded from nine-month lows as
value investors hunted for bargains.
 European shares were poised to open as much as 2.3 percent
higher, financial bookmakers said, helped by a late-session
rally on Wall Street where the big indexes finish largely
unchanged.
 Overall, investors continued to cut risk in their books
because of ever more difficult financing conditions in the euro
zone, tightening U.S. banking regulation and mounting
antagonism between North and South Korea.
 Since global equity markets peaked on April 15, $4.2
trillion in market value has been erased from the MSCI
all-country world stocks index <.MIWD00000PUS>. Unless
confidence builds around a solution to Europe's debt crisis,

 ""Doubts and caution pervade the market. There are doubts
whether southern European countries are the only ones with debt
problems,"" said Suh Dong-pil, a market analyst at Hana Daetoo
Securities in Seoul. ""Growing tensions with North Korea are
also a negative.""
 The euro was down 0.8 percent on the day at $1.2270 ,
creeping back to a four-year low near $1.2140 hit on May 14. It
is on its way to its biggest monthly decline since January
2009.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 1 percent to 110.67 yen
, with support at 108.85 yen, an 8-1/2-year low
struck on Tuesday.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $0.8233 ,
on track for the biggest monthly decline since October 2008.
 STRESSED OUT
 Stress in funding markets has brought back memories of the
fallout from the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008 when a
breakdown in trust of counterparties led to U.S. dollar
hoarding and a lending freeze.
 This time a combination of a rush out of euros and into
U.S. dollars and fears that last weekend's takeover of a small
Spanish savings bank by the country's central bank might be a
sign of widespread trouble have pushed up short-term dollar
financing costs.
 Three-month dollar Libor fixed on Tuesday at 0.5362
, the highest since July 2009, having more than
doubled in the past three months.
 A Reuters poll of money market traders showed the rate was
expected to rise to 0.70 percent over the next month.
[ID:nLDE64O1WE]
 Japan's Nikkei share average rose 0.7 percent <.N225> after
plumbing a six-month low on Tuesday, but was ultimately
dependent on the direction of the euro.
 ""We're likely to see short-covering and bargain-hunting
today, given how far the Nikkei fell yesterday,"" said Toshiyuki
Kanayama, a market analyst at Monex Inc in Tokyo. ""But there's
still a lot of longer-term uncertainty and if the euro turns
volatile the way it was yesterday, things could change.""
 VALUATIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was up
1.7 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>, helped by a bounce in
resource-related and technology shares. Since April 15, Asian
stocks have fallen 18 percent, just short of a 20 percent mark
usually defining a bear market.
 The index was trading at 11.8 times earnings expected in
the next 12 months, the lowest since March 2009, Thomson
Reuters I/B/E/S data showed.
 Valuations have also tumbled in Japan, the United States
and and Europe to where they were at the start of the 2009
rally. With investors focused on economic and financial risks
though, attractive prices may not be enough to support the
market in the near term.
 Ten-year U.S. Treasury note futures  were down 0.2
percent after hitting a one-year high on Tuesday and as
equities gained. The cash market was stable, with the benchmark
10-year yield at 3.18 percent compared with Tuesday's intraday

 * Treasurer Swan says more than 80 companies in
consultation
 * Group of economists backs the new tax
(Recasts, adds Treasurer Swan comments)
 By Victoria Thieberger
 MELBOURNE, May 26 (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd
said on Wednesday it was concerned that other nations could
follow Australia's lead by introducing a windfall tax on mining
profits.
 Australia's new super profits tax, due to come into effect
in mid 2012, has angered the mining industry, which has warned
it puts mine expansions at risk and could push investment
overseas.
 Uncertainty over the tax proposal has wiped billions of
dollars off Australian mining firms' market value and added to
pressure on the Australian dollar, which is leveraged to the
Asian growth story and has lost 11 percent against the U.S.
dollar since the tax was announced in early May.
 ""We are concerned that other countries may see this as
something they want to try out, too,"" Rio CEO Tom Albanese told
shareholders, later adding the government should reconsider
what he called a ""seriously flawed"" tax.
 Analysts have said another resource-rich nation, Brazil,
could consider Australia's tax as a precedent and also raise
taxes on iron ore.
 Mongolia, Zambia, Peru and Ecuador have also considered and
in some cases implemented a similar mining windfall profits
tax.
 Chile, the world's biggest copper exporter, had already
announced temporary higher royalties to help pay to rebuild
towns destroyed by a major earthquake earlier this year.
 A senior Australian Treasury official, David Parker, who is
leading government consultations with miners over the new tax,
said resource-rich nations were increasingly moving towards
mining rent taxes and away from royalty systems.
 He said some provinces in Canada and some U.S. states also
had resource rent taxes.
 Australian iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group has
threatened to pull $15 billion in projects over the tax, while
Rio Tinto has put every Australian investment plan under
review.
 Albanese, who has labelled the new tax as his company's top
global sovereign risk issue, said he was confused by the
government's messages on the tax.
 ""I've been confused by the government's mixed messages,"" he
told Rio's annual meeting, in reference to suggestions the
booming mining sector needs to be slowed to help other parts of
the economy and bring down the Aussie dollar.
 INTERIM REPORT ON TAX DUE THIS WEEK
 Rio has also strongly criticised the consultations over the
new tax, saying the talks are too narrow and do not address
issues around the competitiveness of Australia's industry.
 Treasurer Wayne Swan, however, said more than 80 mining
companies were now involved in consultations over the new tax,
although he declined to comment on areas of possible
compromise, including the starting threshold for the new tax,
set at around 6 percent and based on the 10-year government
bond rate.
 ""The government is continuing to talk to many mining
companies about their views. We are genuine in our
consultation,' Swan told reporters.
 ""I'm not ruling anything in, or out, because I'm going to
repeat what I said at that press conference on day one, which
we are committed to getting a fair share for the Australian
people,"" he said.
 ""We've put out the design of the tax and we are consulting
on that, and that is what we are continuing to do.""
 The tax is the centrepiece of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's
re-election campaign and efforts to counter sliding opinion
polls that hold the outside chance of a hung parliament.
 Australia's Treasury hopes to hand the government an
interim report later this week on its initial talks with
miners.
 The government on Wednesday won backing for its tax plan
from a group of leading economists, who said the new super
profits tax would not harm Australia's current resources boom.
 The group of 20 mainly academic and policy economists
issued an open letter in which they said the replacement of
state-based royalties with a resource rent tax offered a
""superior"" tax that would benefit Australians.

 * Sees aluminium demand improving, led by China demand
 * Still cautious on near term, to manage capital prudently
 * Rio focused on BHP iron ore jv synergies, not BHP's
payment
(Adds details, analyst comment, share price)
 MELBOURNE, May 26 (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto on
Wednesday predicted strong iron ore demand to continue and gave
an upbeat outlook for aluminium, defying sharp slides in
commodity prices and fears of a double-dip global recession.
 Chief Executive Tom Albanese, addressing the firm's annual
meeting in Australia, voiced some caution over near-term
prospects and said he would manage capital cautiously, but made
no substantial revision to the firm's overall bullish outlook.
""The outlook for global iron ore remains very positive and
growth fundamentals remain the same as before the financial
crisis, dominated by the rise of China,"" Albanese said, echoing
comments he made in April to a London meeting of UK
shareholders. Since that meeting global investor confidence
has been shattered by concerns that Europe's sovereign debt
crisis could spark another international banking crisis.
 Commodity prices have tumbled, with the CRB index shedding
nearly 11 percent in the past month in part due to a surging
U.S. dollar.
 Iron ore prices have fallen by more than 20 percent in the
last month on signs China's appetite may be cooling. Copper
prices are down by 12 percent and aluminium by 13 percent.
 A prolonged downturn in iron ore and other metal prices
could hit Rio, BHP Billiton, Vale and other miners furiously
digging for more supplies.
 Current annual worldwide demand for 1.3 billion tonnes of
iron ore suggests a deficit, according to official Australian
government forecasts.
 But that deficit could vanish if iron ore output matches
some growth forecasts of 50 percent more ore by 2015, while
according to UBS uncertainty over the timing and scale of
China's fiscal stimulus over the next two to three years
creates uncertainty for iron ore's demand outlook.
 But Rio Tinto's Albanese put a brave face on the sell-offs
in commodities at the Melbourne meeting on Wednesday, keeping
faith with his longer-term predictions for booming Asian
demand, led by China.
 On aluminium, a metal that once threatened to wreck the
company's finances after a disastrous acquisition in 2007, Rio
Tinto was also upbeat.
 ""China is still the driver of commodities even if its
growth goes to 8 percent and Rio is simply reflecting that
sentiment in today's remarks,"" said Eagle Mining research
analyst Keith Goode.
 Rio shares rose as much as 4.5 percent, outpacing gains in
the wider market, ending up 3.7 percent at A$63.95.
 IRON ORE JV PRIZE
 Rio Tinto said despite concerns about Australia's hefty new
mining tax proposal it remained committed to its planned iron
ore joint venture with BHP Billiton in Western Australia's
Pilbara region.
 Albanese and Chairman Jan du Plessis deflected questions
about shareholders complaining that the $5.8 billion BHP has
agreed to pay to equalise its stake in the joint venture is too
little, focusing instead on the long term benefits of combining
the businesses were far more significant.
 Du Plessis said the $5.8 billion that had been negotiated
was a ""good faith attempt...to establish a number which
appropriately compensates Rio Tinto for the proportion of the
business that will move across to BHP effectively.""
 ""There is too much focus on the detail of this number. In
the long run, the industrial benefits to us and to BHP Billiton
and indeed the industry of putting these businesses together is
what the deal is about,"" du Plessis told reporters, when asked
whether there was scope to renegotiate the equalisation
payment.
 The two companies have estimated that combining their iron
ore operations would result in savings of more than $10
billion. Albanese said in his talks with shareholders, the
focus was on the importance of the synergies.
 ""They like the synergies,"" he said.
 Rio Tinto is concentrating on getting the joint venture
approved by regulatory authorities around the world, he said.
 The first decision is likely to come from the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission. It was to have ruled on
the joint venture on May 27, but has postponed the decision.

 * Tighter funding costs to drive demand for USD
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, May 26 (Reuters) - The euro was off lows on
Wednesday, but there was little respite in store for it as
investors look to sell on every uptick and sentiment bearish on
concerns about the health of the euro zone's banking sector.
 Signs of tighter funding, with costs for banks to borrow
dollars in the interbank market soaring to 10-month highs, is
likely to drive investors to the relative safety of the U.S.
dollar and away from riskier assets and currencies, traders said.
 U.S. two-year swap spreads , a key gauge of
financial system stress, also widened to one-year highs on
Tuesday. [ID:nLDE64O1MP]
 The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over a small
savings bank, CajaSur. Analysts said the bailout highlighted
weakness in the European banking sector and heightened worries
that more banks in the euro zone may need to be bailed out. That
is likely to see more investors fleeing the euro.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was down 0.3 percent at
$1.2335, staying above Tuesday's low of $1.2177 which was not far
from a four-year low of $1.2143 struck last week.
 The euro has lost over 7 percent against the dollar so far
this month and is heading for its biggest monthly fall since
January 2009 at current prices.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback
against a basket of six currencies, was down at 86.59. Against
the yen, the dollar was higher at 90.44 yen  from 90.18 yen
late in New York on Tuesday.
 Against the yen, the euro was at 111.44 yen, recovering from
around 108.85 yen  -- its lowest since late November
2001 -- struck on Tuesday. Investors generally flock to the yen
and the U.S. dollar when risk aversion and volatility spikes.
 ""The best hope for stability will come when cyclical exposure
has been wound down, but the latest IMM and Japanese retail data
suggest that these liquidations have further to run,"" JP Morgan
said in a report.
 JP Morgan said latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show long positions in the Australian dollar and the
and the Mexican peso have fallen by two-thirds but for the
Canadian dollar by only half. Also, Japanese margin longs in the
yen crosses were near all-time highs at the start of the week.
 All of which suggests the recent sell-off in growth-linked
currencies was likely to run further. Tensions on the Korean
peninsula are also likely to keep traders away from the
Australian dollar  which is hugely leveraged to the Asian
growth story.
 The Aussie dollar was steady at $0.8264, having earlier
rallied from 10-month lows against the U.S. dollar.

 * Will proceed with membership bid unilaterally
 * To inform WTO members about Customs Union
 
 By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, May 25 (Reuters) - Russia will next month resume
negotiations to join the World Trade Organisation, suspended
last year after it decided to form a Customs Union with Belarus
and Kazakhstan, Russia's chief negotiator told Reuters.
 ""On June 17 we will resume the WTO accession talks which had
been suspended,"" Maxim Medvedkov said after informal
consultations with members of the working group on Russia's
accession in Geneva on Monday and Tuesday. 
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took investors by surprise
last year when he said that Russia, tired of being kept in the
WTO's waiting room for 16 years, had opted for a union with its
former Soviet neighbours instead. 
 However, the launch of the Customs Union, initially planned
for July 1, was postponed last week after Russia and Belarus
failed to find common ground over the issue of duty-free oil
exports to Belarus. 
 Putin, who personally led the union negotiations with his
Kazakh and Belarussian counterparts, said it would take some
time to iron out differences. 
 Medvedkov said Russia had pledged to provide detailed
information on the Customs Union to all WTO members. He said the
working group members had agreed to amend the report on Russia
to reflect its membership of the union. 
 Medvedkov said Russia would seek WTO membership
unilaterally. Last month it dropped its earlier proposal to join
as a union with Belarus and Kazakhstan.
 ""Our position has not changed, we are continuing
negotiations as sovereign states but agree our positions on all
issues concerning the Customs Union,"" he said. 
 Russia is looking to diversify its exports away from
commodities and energy and shift trade from slow-growing
developed markets to fast-growing emerging and frontier markets.
 WTO membership would help Russia achieve both goals,
increase the country's attractiveness for foreign investors and
facilitate new bilateral trade deals. 
 The United States and the European Union list the status of
Russia's state-owned enterprises, intellectual property rights
and farming subsidies as among stumbling blocks to membership.
 Even before the Customs Union's talks ran into troubles,
Russia had signalled renewed interest in the WTO.[ID:nN26503194]
 A political decision on Russian membership could be taken at
a special summit between Presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack
Obama. The WTO bid is also likely to dominate a Russia-EU summit
next week.

 By Sumeet Desai
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner is heading to Europe this week to press for a united
front against tackling the unfolding euro zone fiscal crisis
that has sent stock markets tumbling around the world.
 U.S. and European officials have so far given no indication
if Geithner will be proposing a new series of measures to
stabilise the region after investors have apparently lost faith
with this month's 750 billion euro ($916.5 billion) rescue.
[ID:nSGE64O00O]
 But Washington is clearly unhappy with Germany's decision
to go it alone in banning some types of speculative trading as
it considers the measures counterproductive.
 Geithner flies into London from Beijing on Wednesday
morning for his first face-to-face meeting with George Osborne
since Britain's new finance minister took office 2 weeks ago.
 They plan a joint press conference in the afternoon.
Geithner also will meet with Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King, the U.S. Treasury Department said.
 The next stop is Frankfurt for a meeting with European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. He then goes to
Berlin on Thursday where no doubt German finance minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble will get a stern dressing down for his
government's unilateral restrictions on speculative trading.
 Osborne refused to be drawn on whether Geithner was
attempting to stitch together some kind of second stabilisation
package to bring confidence back to markets. Asked the question
on Monday, he said that he had not had the meeting yet
 ""He is coming to talk about the situation in the euro zone,
the situation in European banking, the G20 agenda for the
finance ministers meeting in South Korea and the G20 leaders'
summit in Canada,"" he said.
 QUICK ACTION NEEDED
 Washington has been dismayed by how far the Greek crisis
has spread to the rest of the euro zone and once again put the
entire world banking system under threat by what it thinks was
a lack of decisive and early action.
 It was the U.S. Treasury that initiated this month's G7
emergency conference calls that led to the massive rescue fund
for the euro zone but there is rising concern that this may not
have been enough and markets are still falling sharply.
 A senior U.S. Treasury official said that Europe has now
put in place a substantial framework of policy measures aimed
at preventing the risk that problems originating in Greece will
spill over into other countries.
 But Washington is unhappy with Germany's move to ban naked
short selling -- the practice of selling securities that are
neither owned nor borrowed.
 The official said such actions were more likely
counter-productive and tended to cause more damage to public
confidence.
 STRESS TESTS
 Geithner will urge European officials this week to conduct
some form of banking system stress tests, CNBC reported on
Tuesday, citing an Obama administration official.
 A Treasury spokesman decline to comment on the report.
 The stress tests, however, would have to differ from those
conducted by U.S. regulators in the spring of 2009, because
Europe lacks a huge bailout fund like the $700 billion Troubled
Asset Relief Program to plug any capital deficiencies found,
CNBC said.
 Geithner and other Treasury officials routinely cite the
U.S. stress tests, which helped open the door for private
capital to return to the banking sector, as calming intense
market turmoil caused by the financial crisis.
 In October EU finance ministers unveiled the results of
stress tests on the region's lenders, saying European banks
would be able to withstand a harsh recession in spite of
further heavy losses.
 Investors are nervous that banks could see their capital
cushion evaporate if loans go unpaid in a recession, forcing
them to turn to the state for further help.
 In a worst-case scenario, not one of the region's 22 most
important banks would see its capital buffer slip into perilous
territory, the minister said.
 However, the European stress tests were widely perceived by
the financial markets as less strenuous, less extensive and
less transparent than the U.S. tests.
 LONDON SUPPORT
 Geithner will find some backing for a broader position in
London where the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat government
has said greater cooperation in policymaking is essential and
officials have privately derided Berlin's actions as mad.
 The U.S. Treasury official said the talks with Osborne were
partly to meet a new colleague but also to discuss European
issues ahead of a busy round of international diplomacy with
G20 finance ministers meeting in Korea and leaders in Canada in
June.
 Washington may also want to sound the new British
administration out on how quickly fiscal policy will be
tightened.
 Former U.K. Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government
had been a big supporter of keeping fiscal stimulus in place
until recovery was more assured. Its demise might mean that the
U.S. has less cover for its own fiscal laxity when markets are
getting increasingly focused on public debt.
 Settling things down in Europe is also essential for
Washington's other big policy aim. Geithner has been in Beijing
this week for two days of talks which ended with the U.S.
Treasury Secretary saying when and how to go ahead with reform
of its yuan currency was a matter for the Chinese authorities.
 But analysts say Washington's hopes of China moving toward
letting its yuan currency float more freely against the dollar
and thus make U.S. firms more competitive have taken a body
blow from the problems in the euro zone as Beijing is less
likely to move when markets are so volatile.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and the euro pared
deep losses to end mostly flat on Tuesday as investors had
second thoughts that a festering euro zone banking crisis will
spread worldwide and strangle a reviving economy.
 A late-day rally pulled the benchmark S&P 500 into positive
territory minutes before the closing bell and wiped out most of
the session's losses for the Dow, which closed above the key
barrier of 10,000.
 U.S. Treasuries gave up most of their gains as equities
rebounded from a broad sell-off and the euro staged a rebound
from multi-year lows. Earlier, major stock indexes from Asia to
Europe closed sharply lower and Wall Street fell more than 3
percent. For details see: [ID:nN25148217]
 ""It's a selling climax. This has all the looks to me of a
capitulation, this being the bottom,"" said Keith Springer,
president of Capital Financial Advisory Services in Sacramento,
California.
 He said investors had overreacted to fears that a European
banking crisis could worsen and fester like the U.S. subprime
mortgage crisis that sparked the global recession.
 ""We know about the banking crisis. Too many people are
assuming it is going to turn into something different and be a
contagion, and it's not going to be a contagion,"" Springer
said.
 The euro earlier fell to an 8-1/2-year low against the yen
and neared a four-year trough versus the dollar as investors
fretted about the weekend takeover of a small Spanish savings
bank, CajaSur.
 Traders said small buy orders pushed the euro higher amid
thin volumes, triggering stops above $1.2300.
 The euro  was down 0.02 percent at $1.2348,
recovering from losses of more than 1 percent.
 Severe stress signs appeared in the credit markets, where
dollar interbank lending rates rose as the debt crisis made
banks wary of lending to European peers. [ID:nLDE64O1MP]
 Other measures of stress in money markets were at their
highest since the financial system emerged from the subprime
mortgage crisis a little more than a year ago.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 22.82
points, or 0.23 percent, at 10,043.75. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> gained 0.38 points, or 0.04 percent, at
1,074.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> fell 2.60 points,
or 0.12 percent, at 2,210.95.
 The rebound in U.S. stocks dimmed the allure of safe-haven
government bonds and erased the day's large price gains.
 The benchmark 10-year note  cut gains sharply
late in the session, last up 7/32 in price. That was a far cry
from earlier gains that pushed 10-year yields down as far as
3.06 percent, their lowest since April 2009.
 ""We're just trading off stocks right now,"" said Keith
Blackwell, U.S. interest rate strategist at RBC Capital Markets
in New York.
 The equity sell-off and escalating tensions in the Korean
peninsula had pushed investors to flock to the yen and dollar
for safety.
 ""Increasingly, market participants are getting scared and
fearful that we may have a repeat of late 2008,"" said Camilla
Sutton, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto, said before markets turned around.
 U.S. oil futures slid 2 percent, falling below $70 a barrel
as investors fled riskier assets to dollar safety.

 U.S. crude  fell $1.46, or 2.08 percent, to settle at
$68.75 a barrel, trading in a range from $67.15 to $69.91.
 ICE Brent crude  fell $1.62, or 2.28 percent, to
settle $69.55 a barrel.
 Dropping from a 2010 peak of $87.15 on May 3, the highest
since October 2008, U.S. crude prices could post their biggest
monthly loss since the height of the financial crisis.
 U.S. gold futures finished with moderate gains in a

capped gold's gains. [ID:nN25546218]

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro plunged to an
8-1/2-year low against the yen and fell to a near four-year
trough against the dollar on Tuesday, as Spain's takeover of a
small bank fueled fears of systemic risks within the banking
system that could hurt global growth prospects.
 The single euro zone currency, however, recouped some
losses in afternoon trading as Wall Street shares recovered
from an early plunge. Traders said small buy orders have pushed
the euro higher in thin volume, triggering stops above $1.23.
 A slide in global stock prices and escalating tensions in
the Korean peninsula also drove investors to flock to the yen
and dollar for safety, attracted by the generally stable
financial systems of the United States and Japan and the high
liquidity of their respective currencies.
 ""The general fear is that developments in Europe would have
a much broader global impact. Increasingly, market participants
are getting scared and fearful that we may have a repeat of
late 2008,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over a
small savings bank, CajaSur. Analysts said the bailout
highlighted weakness in the European banking sector and spurred
worries that more banks may need to be bailed out at a time
when European countries are trying to repair their public
finances.
 In late afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.1
percent at $1.2338, coming off session lows at $1.2177. The
euro last week touched a four-year low of $1.2143 on electronic
trading platform EBS.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks the
greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.4 percent
to 86.571.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.3 percent to 89.93.
Sterling was down 0.3 percent at $1.4381.
 ""We had some short-covering in the euro this afternoon,
which led to some stop-losses,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Technically, he added, that there may be a reversal in
trend in the next few days, suggesting that U.S. stocks may
have notched a key low and the U.S. dollar a crucial high.
 EURO TREND STILL LOWER
 The euro has lost 7.2 percent against the dollar so far
this month and is heading for its biggest monthly fall since
January 2009 at current prices.
 Scotia's Sutton said she expects the euro to breach that
four-year low at $1.2143, with $1.18 as the next key level.
 Against the yen, the euro fell to around 108.85 yen -- its
lowest since late November 2001 -- according to EBS. It last
traded at 111.28, slightly down on the day.
 Tensions on the Korea peninsula also buoyed the dollar and
yen after South Korea's Yonhap news agency said North Korean
leader Kim Jong-il had told his troops to prepare for combat.
The South Korean won at one point fell nearly 5 percent.
 Investors were also on edge after three-month dollar Libor
rates soared to 10-month highs as banks became more cautious
about lending to European institutions after the Spanish
bailout over the weekend. U.S. two-year swap spreads, a key
gauge of financial system stress, also widened to one-year
highs on Tuesday.
 Growth-linked currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars initially retreated, but recovered late in the
session. The Aussie dollar was flat on the day at 74.51 yen
after trading lower for most of the session.
 The Australian currency also rallied from 10-month lows

 TORONTO, May 25 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slumped to
its weakest level in almost seven months on Tuesday in a broad
global selloff of riskier assets, amid growing concern about
Europe's debt crisis and the prospect of a Korean military
conflict.
 Risk aversion dragged down global stocks, the price of oil
and commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar,
which hit C$1.0854 to the U.S. dollar, or 92.13 U.S. cents, its
lowest level since Nov. 3. [MKTS/GLOB] [O/R] [FRX/]
 Instead, investors flocked to the traditional safety of the
greenback, yen, Swiss franc and gold. [GOL/] [US/]
 ""It was part of the broader risk aversion theme that we saw
unfolding late yesterday in North American trading,"" said
Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets.
 ""That whole push saw not only equities but also commodities
selling off quite aggressively and taking dollar/CAD above
C$1.08""
 But the Canadian dollar made up some ground after North
American stocks sharply cut losses to end near flat.
 ""We're starting to see aggressive moves in North American

 The Canadian dollar closed Tuesday's session at C$1.0700 to

C$1.0593 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.40 U.S. cents, at Friday's
finish. Canadian financial markets were closed on Monday for
the Victoria Day holiday.
 The euro fell to an 8-1/2-year low against the yen and
neared a four-year low versus the U.S. dollar after Spain's
weekend move to rescue the small CajaSur savings bank sparked
worries the euro zone sovereign debt crisis is spreading.

 Meanwhile, North Korea said it was cutting all ties with
the South and threatened its wealthy neighbor with military
action over alleged violations of its waters off the west
coast. [ID:nSGE64O03B]
 ""Korea probably played into the risk aversion theme but
without Europe it wouldn't have been such a significant issue,""
said Strauss.
 The volatility on financial markets brings into question
whether the Bank of Canada will start raising interest rates in
June. Its next scheduled policy setting is in a week's time.
 Central bank rate hike expectations, reflected in yields on
overnight index swaps, have fallen hard from April 20 when the
Bank of Canada removed its conditional commitment to hold rates
at record lows until June.
 At that point the market was pricing in more than a 90
percent chance of a June 1 hike, compared with about 45 percent
on Tuesday. 
 ""There are too many moving parts to suggest that the Bank
of Canada, at this point in time, is good to go,"" said Jack
Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange at National Bank
Financial.
 Currencies tend to strengthen as interest rates rise as
higher rates attract capital flows.
 CANADIAN BONDS OUTPERFORM
 With rate hike expectations in doubt, Canadian bond prices
rallied across the curve, despite U.S. Treasury issues giving
up gains as stocks mounted a late rebound. [US/]
 Last week, a Reuters survey found all of Canada's primary
securities dealers still forecast a rate hike in June, but
cautioned the fallout from Europe's debt crisis means a rate
increase is not certain. [ID:nN21160493]
 ""The market is pretty much sitting on the fence,"" said
Strauss.
 Bond prices tend to fall when interest rates go up as their
low-yielding fixed payments seem less lucrative compared with
rising yields on other investments and vice versa.
 The two-year government bond  jumped 5 Canadian
cents to C$99.81 yield 1.596 percent, while the 10-year bond
 soared 86 Canadian cents to C$102.00 to yield 3.265

 * Package short on structural moves to help growth
 * Will hurt Berlusconi's ratings, may endanger govt

 By Gavin Jones
 ROME, May 25 (Reuters) - Italy's austerity package approved
on Tuesday contains real cuts and will probably lower the budget
deficit as targeted but may also accelerate the recent decline
in popularity of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
 Italy's need for fiscal adjustment is less urgent than that
of Greece, Spain and Portugal and its measures are accordingly
less draconian, but they should still protect its sovereign debt
against market volatility, at least in the short term.
 Analysts would have preferred to see more structural steps
such as legislation to raise the average retirement age,
currently around 61, and measures to increase Italy's
notoriously low economic growth potential.
 However, unlike many Italian budgets of the past, most of
the main measures, such as the public sector staff and salary
cuts and the reduced funding for local government, can be
expected to produce the savings targeted.
 ""The combination of these austerity measures with even a
mediocre improvement in growth should be enough to bring the
deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2012,"" said Deutsche Bank
economist Gilles Moec.

 MAIN LOSERS
 The package hits public employees, in particular, by
blocking salary rises for three years while replacing only one
in five of those who leave.
 Workers who had earned the right to retire are forced to
work an extra six months and public services will be hurt by
deep cuts in the funding of city and regional governments.
 No details were released after the cabinet meeting, but the
main features of the budget had already been announced.
 From an economic point of view, the reliance on spending
cuts rather than taxes hikes or amnesties is to be welcomed.
 The tax burden is already at record levels above 43 percent
of GDP and public spending, at 52.5 percent, has also has been
rising steadily and is notoriously inefficient.
 But while economists might applaud -- at least quietly --
millions of Italians will not, with a probable backlash for
Berlusconi and perhaps also for government stability.
 
 BERLUSCONI RISK
 Even as Italy went through its worst post-war recession, the
73 year-old media tycoon's approval ratings remained stubbornly
high, seemingly invulnerable to economic woes and scandals over
his private life.
 However, his popularity has recently fallen sharply as the
extent of the looming cuts became clear. The most recent poll,
by the ISPO agency on Monday, showed only 35 percent thought the
government had performed well, down from 50 percent a year ago.
 After keeping an uncharacteristically low profile during the
budget's preparation, the prime minister must now try to
convince Italians yet again that the future is rosy, even as
their salaries and frontline services are cut.
 Berlusconi, who owns Italy's three main commercial
telelevision channels and controls state broadcaster RAI, is
famous for his communication skills. But the task may still be
beyond him, with unpredictable consequences for stability.
 The centre-right coalition is already creaking. Berlusconi
is at loggerheads with right-wing leader Gianfranco Fini,
co-founder of his People of Freedom party, and the pro-autonomy
Northern League suspect he will not keep his pledge to devolve
fiscal powers to the regions.
 These tensions will only increase if Berlusconi's
popularity goes into free fall, increasing the risk of a
government collapse.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro plunged to an
8-1/2-year low against the yen and neared a four-year trough
versus the dollar on Tuesday, as Spain's weekend takeover of a
small bank fueled fears of systemic risks within the banking
system that could hurt global growth prospects.
 A slide in global stock prices and escalating tensions in
the Korean peninsula also drove investors to flock to the yen
and dollar for safety, attracted by the generally stable
financial systems of the United States and Japan and the high
liquidity of their currencies.
 ""The general fear is that developments in Europe would have
a much broader global impact. Increasingly, market participants
are getting scared and fearful that we may have a repeat of
late 2008,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist at
Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over a
small savings bank, CajaSur. Analysts said the bailout
highlighted weakness in the European banking sector and spurred
worries that more banks may need to be bailed out at a time
when European countries are trying to repair their public
finances.
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.3
percent at $1.2322 after coming off a session low at $1.2177.
The euro last week touched a four-year low of $1.2143 on
electronic trading platform EBS .
 Sutton said she expects the euro to breach that four-year
low, with $1.18 the next key level.
 The euro has lost 7.8 percent against the dollar so far
this month and is heading for its biggest monthly fall since
January 2009 at current prices.
 Against the yen, the euro fell to around 108.85 yen
, its lowest since late November 2001, according to
EBS. It last changed hands at 110.77, down 0.5 percent.
 Tensions on the Korea peninsula also buoyed the dollar and
yen after South Korea's Yonhap news agency said North Korean
leader Kim Jong-il had told his troops to prepare for combat.
The South Korean won  fell nearly 5 percent at one point.

rates soared to 10-month highs July as banks became more

 U.S. two-year swap spreads  , a key gauge of
financial system stress, rose to one-year highs on Tuesday.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the
greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.9 percent
to 86.965.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.3 percent to 89.93
. Sterling was down 0.3 percent at $1.4381 .
 Growth-linked currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars retreated. The Aussie dropped 1.2 percent
against the yen  and fell to a 10-month low versus
the U.S. dollar at US$0.8068 .
 ""Market conditions have been extremely good over the last
year or so and people have built up very large positive risk
positions,"" said Aroop Chatterjee, senior currency strategist
at Barclays Capital in New York.
 ""If volatility and risk worsens further, we will see a
continued move by investors to cut those positions.""

 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - Global stocks and commodity
prices fell sharply on Tuesday on fears that euro zone banking
troubles could spread to dampen the world recovery and as
tensions over the two Koreas added to investors' unease.
 Oil fell below $68 a barrel at one point and gold prices
shot above $1,200 an ounce as investors fled riskier assets to
the safety of bullion, and the U.S. and Japanese currencies.

worries the euro zone sovereign debt crisis is spreading.
[ID:nN25121933]
 ""People are worried the euro zone crisis will spread and
derail the global economic recovery,"" said Carsten Fritsch,
analyst at Commerzbank.
 There were signs of stress in credit markets. Dollar
interbank lending rates rose and were seen pushing higher as
the debt crisis made banks wary of lending to European peers.

 Other measures of stress in money markets were at their
highest since the financial system emerged from the subprime
mortgage crisis a little more than a year ago.
 ""It's a run for dollar liquidity. Everybody wants to move
out of the euro and wants dollars, so the problem is access to
dollar liquidity is strained,"" said Patrick Jacq, a strategist
at BNP Paribas.
 On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 touched its lowest
point since early November 2009 and was trading down about 13
percent from its closing high in late April. Some traders said
they were looking for a 20 percent drop from that April peak,
which would mark a move into a bear market.

 * Germany's unilateral move set for criticism
 * Markets tumble, safe haven assets sought
 * Bank stress tests to be in spotlight
 
 By Sumeet Desai
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim
Geithner is heading to Europe this week to press for a united
front against tackling the unfolding euro zone fiscal crisis
that has sent stock markets tumbling around the world. 
 U.S. and European officials have so far given no indication
if Geithner will be proposing a new series of measures to
stabilise the region after investors have apparently lost faith
with this month's 750 billion euro ($916.5 billion) rescue.
 But Washington is clearly unhappy with Germany's decision to
go it alone in banning some types of speculative trading as it
considers the measures counterproductive. 
 Geithner flies into London from Beijing on Wednesday morning
for his first face-to-face meeting with George Osborne since
Britain's new finance minister took office 2 weeks ago.
 The next stop is Frankfurt for a meeting with European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. He then goes to
Berlin on Thursday where no doubt German finance minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble will get a stern dressing down for his
government's unilateral restrictions on speculative trading.
 Osborne refused to be drawn on whether Geithner was
attempting to stitch together some kind of second stabilisation
package to bring confidence back to markets. Asked the question
on Monday, he said that he had not had the meeting yet.
 ""He is coming to talk about the situation in the euro zone,
the situation in European banking, the G20 agenda for the
finance ministers meeting in South Korea and the G20 leaders'
summit in Canada,"" he said.
 
 QUICK ACTION NEEDED
 Washington has been dismayed by how far the Greek crisis has
spread to the rest of the euro zone and once again put the
entire world banking system under threat by what it thinks was a
lack of decisive and early action.
 It was the U.S. Treasury that initiated this month's G7
emergency conference calls that led to the massive rescue fund
for the euro zone but there is rising concern that this may not
have been enough and markets are still falling sharply.
 A senior U.S. Treasury official said that Europe has now put
in place a substantial framework of policy measures aimed at
preventing the risk that problems originating in Greece will
spill over into other countries.
 But Washington is unhappy with Germany's move to ban naked
short selling -- the practice of selling securities that are
neither owned nor borrowed.
 The official said such actions were more likely
counter-productive and tended to cause more damage to public
confidence.
 
 STRESS TESTS
 Geithner will urge European officials this week to conduct
some form of banking system stress tests, CNBC reported on
Tuesday, citing an Obama administration official.
 The stress tests, however, would have to differ from those
conducted by U.S. regulators in the spring of 2009, because
Europe lacks a huge bailout fund like the $700 billion Troubled
Asset Relief Program to plug any capital deficiencies found,
CNBC said.
 Geithner and other Treasury officials routinely cite the
U.S. stress tests, which helped open the door for private
capital to return to the banking sector, as calming intense
market turmoil caused by the financial crisis.
 In October EU finance ministers unveiled the results of
stress tests on the region's lenders, saying European banks
would be able to withstand a harsh recession in spite of further
heavy losses.
 Investors are nervous that banks could see their capital
cushion evaporate if loans go unpaid in a recession, forcing
them to turn to the state for further help.
 In a worst-case scenario, not one of the region's 22 most
important banks would see its capital buffer slip into perilous
territory, the minister said.
 However, the European stress tests were widely perceived by
the financial markets as less strenuous, less extensive and less
transparent than the U.S. tests.
 
 LONDON SUPPORT
 Geithner will find some backing for a broader position in
London where the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat government
has said greater cooperation in policymaking is essential and
officials have privately derided Berlin's actions as mad.
 The U.S. Treasury official said the talks with Osborne were
partly to meet a new colleague but also to discuss European
issues ahead of a busy round of international diplomacy with G20
finance ministers meeting in Korea and leaders in Canada in
June.
 Washington may also want to sound the new British
administration out on how quickly fiscal policy will be
tightened.
 Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government had
been a big supporter of keeping fiscal stimulus in place until
recovery was more assured. Its demise might mean that the U.S.
has less cover for its own fiscal laxity when markets are
getting increasingly focused on public debt.
 Settling things down in Europe is also essential for
Washington's other big policy aim. Geithner has been in Beijing
this week for two days of talks which ended with the Treasury
Secretary saying when and how to go ahead with reform of its
yuan currency was a matter for the Chinese authorities.
 But analysts say Washington's hopes of China moving toward
letting its yuan currency float more freely against the dollar
and thus make U.S. firms more competitive have taken a body blow
from the problems in the euro zone as Beijing is less likely to
move when markets are so volatile.

 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro neared a four-year
low against the U.S. dollar and hit a 8-1/2-year trough against
the yen on Tuesday after Spain's weekend takeover of a small
bank fanned fears the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis is

 The dollar and yen rallied as global stock prices tumbled
and tensions in the Korean peninsula escalated, prompting
investors to flock to the U.S. and Japanese currencies for

bank CajaSur. Although CajaSur is relatively small, analysts
said the bailout highlighted weakness in the European banking

public finances.
 ""People have looked at Greece over the last three to four
months and now they're focusing their attention on Spain and
its banking sector,"" said Aroop Chatterjee, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital in New York.
 ""For the euro, our bias is to be bearish. We're not looking
for an extremely sharp selloff in the short term. We think it's
going to be a slow grind lower,"" he added.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was down 0.8 percent
at $1.2259 after coming off a session low at $1.2177 -- not far
from a four-year low of $1.2143 touched last week on electronic

 MONEY MARKET STRAINS
 The International Monetary Fund said on Monday that Spain
faces ""severe"" challenges including a large fiscal deficit and
a banking sector ""with pockets of weakness,"" and must make
far-reaching reforms if it is to make its economy competitive
again.
 ""The ability to deliver is more important in Spain than
anywhere else -- for the euro and for broader risk sentiment as
well,"" Thomas Stolper, global head of FX strategy at Goldman
Sachs, said in a note. ""At 12 percent of euro zone GDP, Spain
is systemically important.""
 The euro's downside targets stood at the recent low of
$1.2143 and at $1.2133, a 50-percent retracement of a rally
from its all-time low around $0.8225 in October 2000 to its
record peak of $1.6040 touched in July 2008, traders said.
 The next support would be the psychologically important
$1.2000, where many stops are believed to be set, they said.
 Worries about the euro-zone debt crisis pushed U.S.
two-year swap spreads -- a key gauge of financial system
stress. Dollar interbank rates rose as banks are wary of

 * Egyptian pound's weakness hits carry trade
 * Non-resident Egyptian T-bill holdings decline
 
 By Patrick Werr
 CAIRO, May 25 (Reuters) - The Egyptian pound non-deliverable
forwards market has almost ground to a halt in recent weeks as
buyers flee risk because of the euro zone debt crisis.
 Just two months ago, traders estimated notional turnover in
the offshore NDF market was running at about $20 million to $40
million a day as foreign institutions used NDFs to speculate.
 But by pushing the euro  down to four-year lows
against the dollar and increasing safe-haven demand for dollars,
the euro zone crisis is depriving the NDF market of liquidity.
 The shift illustrates the fragility of trade in frontier
markets that are heavily dependent on fund flows from foreign
financial institutions, which can quickly pull in their horns
when the global climate worsens.
 ""Risk aversion is quite high at the moment. It will depend a
lot on what happens. The whole situation in Europe has got
people a bit scared,"" said a London-based trader of Egyptian
pound NDFs.
 ""There is no interest to sell dollars against Egyptian,""
said another trader in London, estimating that six months ago,
notional totals of between $100 million and $200 million were
going through the Egyptian pound NDF market on some days.
 ""Now it just tends to be the odd trade. Obviously the
volatility of the euro is a particularly adverse fact.""
 
 BIGGEST
 By some estimates, Egypt has Africa's biggest spot foreign
exchange market after South Africa, but capital controls make it
hard for banks to profit in the onshore spot market for Egyptian
pounds , which is tightly managed by the central bank.
 So speculators have flocked to offshore NDFs, which are
contracts for notional currency trades settled on future dates.
Traders used the 12 p.m. spot rate on the Egyptian foreign
exchange page on Reuters  as their base rate.
 About 30 percent of NDF  demand was linked to
underlying commercial or investment transactions and the rest
was speculation, traders estimated.
 NDF trade was boosted by the fact that early this year, the
pound's stability attracted a strong carry trade, with investors
raising money in lower-yielding currencies and exchanging it to
buy 91-day Egyptian Treasury bills.
 Foreign investors were happy to obtain after-tax yields of
around 9 percent on Egyptian bills on the assumption that the
local currency would remain steady.
 ""Egypt is the darling of international yield-hungry
investors,"" one NDF dealer said at the time.
 Eleven economists polled by Reuters early last month
forecast that the pound would remain virtually unchanged at
around 5.51 against the dollar until the end of 2010.
[ID:nLDE63625W]
 
 WEAKNESS
 Since then, however, the pound has dropped to 5.65, a
14-month low, as Egypt has allowed the currency to weaken in
response to the dollar's crisis-induced strength against the
euro and the currencies of Egypt's main trading partners.
 Although the Egyptian pound's fall has been small compared
to the drops of some other emerging market currencies during the
crisis, it has shattered investors' faith in the stability of
the pound.
 Non-resident holdings of Egyptian T-bills rose to about $5.5
billion in mid-March, Deutsche Bank calculated in an April 15
report.
 But they have now fallen back substantially, said Moustafa
Assal, a bond specialist at Beltone Financial.
 ""The U.S. dollar's appreciation against the euro forced many
non-residents to sell Egyptian Treasury bills,"" Assal said. ""The
EU debt crisis is pushing equity and fixed income investors out
of Egyptian markets.""

 * Allied Irish shares down 14 percent, Bank of Ireland 12
percent
 
 DUBLIN, May 25 (Reuters) - Irish bank shares fell up to 14
percent on Tuesday amid a global sell-off, posing a risk for
Allied Irish Banks' private capital raising plans and to a
lesser extent for Bank of Ireland's rights issue.
Bank of Ireland last week received shareholder approval for
its 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) capital raising plan,
including a 1.7 billion euro rights issue, which the government
wants to showcase as an example other lenders such as Allied
Irish could follow.
 Bank of Ireland's cash call is fully underwritten, but a
poor take-up of its shares would send a negative signal for the
whole Irish financial sector, with bancassurer Irish Life &
Permanent also looking to raise about 700 million euros.
 ""People might not bother taking up their rights but it's
fully underwritten,"" one Dublin-based trader said after Bank of
Ireland's shares fell 12.3 percent to 64 cents by 1349 GMT,
compared with a rights issue price of 55 cents.
 ""Allied Irish in particular is struggling because people are
struggling to work out how they can raise their capital by the
year end with their share price where it is at the moment"", the
trader said.
 Shares in Allied Irish traded 14.4 percent weaker at 89 euro
cents, down from a peak of 1.79 euros in March and
underperforming a 4.6 percent weaker European banking sector.
 Allied Irish needs to raise 7.4 billion euros to plug the
hole after transfers to the National Asset Management Agency
(NAMA), a ""bad bank"", and to meet new regulatory requirements by
an end-of-year deadline.
 It has put up for sale some of its most profitable units,
including stakes in Poland's BZ WBK and M&T Bank Corp in the
United States, and traders said the current volatility could hit
the prices it is looking for.
 ""Because of what has happened globally in the last week or
two, especially in the last two or three days, no bank is going
to stick its head above the parapet and start buying other
banks,"" the trader said.
 Even if AIB gets satisfactory value for the asset sales, it
will still need to raise over 3 billion euros according to
Stephen Lyons, analyst at Davy Stockbrokers and will need to
follow Bank of Ireland in launching a rights issue.
 ""At today's price and looking at the value of its stakes (in
its US, Polish units), you're talking about it having to raise
about 3.1 billion euros,"" Lyons said.
 If investor appetite is lacking and Allied Irish is unable
to make its offerings by the regulator's deadline, that could
lead to the government shareholding in the group rising to as
much as 83 percent.

 SAO PAULO, May 25 (Reuters) - A sovereign debt crisis in
Europe is the biggest threat to global economic recovery,
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, said on Tuesday.
 European countries must settle their fiscal problems as
they seek to expand their economies, he added.
 ""The main risk is related to the so-called debt crisis,""
Strauss-Kahn said at an event in Sao Paulo.
 While some reforms to financial systems have already
happened, work remains, he said, adding that regulatory reform
must not derail the global economy further.
 The European Union and the IMF have already announced a
nearly $1 trillion lifeline for heavily-indebted nations such
as Greece, Portugal and Spain, in a bid to reinforce the euro
and contain fiscal problems before they spill further.
 But global investors have been largely unconvinced,
punishing riskier assets such as stocks around the world and
the euro currency .

 The stiff austerity measures dictated by the euro zone
rescue plan have investors worried an already-sluggish global
economic rebound could slow further.
 Europe's debt problems are unlikely to snowball into a
global credit crisis similar to the one that followed the
collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, IMF director Nicolas
Eyzaguirre said earlier this month.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday to a
8 1/2-year low against the yen and neared a 4-year trough
versus the U.S. dollar after Spain's weekend takeover of a
small savings bank fanned fears the euro-zone sovereign debt
crisis is spreading.
 The dollar and yen rallied as global stock prices tumbled
and strains in money markets worsened, prompting investors to
flock to the U.S. and Japanese currencies for safety.
 The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over
savings bank CajaSur. Although CajaSur is relatively small,
analysts said the bailout highlighted weakness in the European
banking sector and fueled worries more banks may need to be
bailed out at a time when European Union governments are trying
to repair their public finances.
 ""There appears to be concern that the takeover of the
Spanish bank over the weekend is an indication that possibly
the EU debt crisis is spreading,"" said Michael Malpede, chief
market analyst at Easy Forex in Chicago.
 ""You have that coupled with the IMF making statements
urging Spain to do more to overhaul its banks, and that seems
to bring the focus to the risk of debt contagion,"" he added.
 In early New York trading, the euro was down 1.3 percent at
$1.2190, near a four-year low of $1.2143 hit last week on
electronic trading platform EBS.
 Against the yen, the euro fell to around 108.85 yen, its
lowest since late November, 2001, according to Reuters data. It
was last at 109.06 yen, down 2 percent.
 Signs of problems in the Spanish banking system added to an
already grim outlook for euro zone growth, with Italy becoming
the latest country in the region to unveil austerity measures.
 ""Fears are growing that a collapse in confidence could undo
the positive growth impulses that are still present, with
tensions in money markets resulting in dollar liquidity drying
up,"" said Kenneth Broux, senior market economist at Lloyds TSB.
 The euro has lost 8.2 percent versus the dollar this month,
heading for its biggest monthly fall since January 2009 at
current prices.
 MONEY MARKET STRAINS
 The euro's downside targets stood at the recent low of
$1.2143 and at $1.2133, a 50-percent retracement of a rally
from its all-time low around $0.8225 in October 2000 to its
record peak of $1.6040 touched in July 2008, traders said.
 The next support would be the psychologically important
$1.2000, where many stops are believed to be set, they said.
 Worries about the euro-zone debt crisis pushed U.S.
two-year swap spreads pushed out to their widest levels in 13
months on Tuesday and traders expecting benchmark dollar LIBOR
to keep ratcheting higher as banks are wary of lending to
European institutions.
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks the
greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 1.3 percent
to 87.311.
 Against the yen, the dollar dipped 0.7 percent to 89.52.
Sterling was down 0.8 percent to $1.4308.
 Growth-linked currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars retreated. The Aussie dropped 1.8 percent
against the yen and fell to a 10-month low versus the U.S.
dollar of $0.8068. Traders reported strong selling interest
above $0.8120.
 Tensions on the Korea peninsula also buoyed the dollar and
yen after South Korea's Yonhap news agency said North Korean
leader Kim Jong-il had told his troops to prepare for combat.

 * Hedge funds down 2.91 percent so far this month
 * Favours global macro managers, some long-short equity
 
 By Laurence Fletcher
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have aggressively cut
back bets in recent weeks during a difficult month that has seen
the euro tumble and stock market volatility soar, said Pictet's
head of alternative investments, Nicolas Campiche.
 Hedge funds are now positioned defensively with lower levels
of borrowing, said Campiche, who oversees more than $8 billion
invested in portfolios of hedge funds.
 He thinks global macro managers are best placed to profit
from the turbulence.
 ""The first week of May was difficult,"" Campiche said in an
interview late on Monday. ""Since then managers have derisked
quite aggressively. Like everyone, they don't have a clue where
things are heading so they've reduced their balance sheet.
 ""Right now, leverage is very low,"" he added. ""Funds are
playing defence but there's no panic... Everyone is much more on
their toes.""
 However, funds are still not as cautious as during the nadir
of the credit crisis in late 2008 and early 2009, he added.
 Hedge fund long leverage was just over 1.5 times in October
2008, according to data from Britain's Financial Services
Authority, rising to 1.78 times by October 2009.
 Campiche's comments come during a volatile month for stocks
and currencies.
 The VIX index of volatility has doubled between the end of
April and last week, following the Dow Jones's temporary slump
in the first week of May and a slump in the euro on worries over
the debt of southern European countries.
 Hedge funds are already losing money this month as despite
constant publicity around short-selling activities, most are
often positioned to benefit more from market rises than falls.
 According to Hedge Fund Research's HFRX index, funds are
down 2.91 percent from the start of the month to May 20, more
than wiping out their gains this year. Equity hedge funds are
down 4.48 percent.
 With the FTSE 100 down 2.5 percent at 1206 GMT on Tuesday,
further losses look likely.
 
 UNCERTAINTY TO PREVAIL
 Campiche said he is backing global macro funds -- which bet
on currencies, stocks, bonds and commodities -- to profit in the
current turbulence.
 ""We think markets will continue to be dominated by political
and macro events. The managers best positioned to analyse and
react are global macro managers,"" he said.
 ""We think uncertainty will prevail in markets and economies,
which will lead to high volatility, which is a positive for
global macro.""
 He also likes long-short equity funds that focus on company
fundamentals and that can profit both from share price rises and
falls.
 ""We like long-short. We think there will be more opportunity
to create alpha than in 2008 or 2009, when the market tended to
move as a whole. We have a feeling investors will pay more
attention to company fundamentals.""
 Campiche said his fund of hedge funds is up 2 percent so far
this year, after a 16 percent loss in 2008 and a 14 percent gain
last year.

809,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2010 09:27AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Germany may extend short sale ban on shares -draft," * May ban naked short selling of shares - FinMin paper
 * Government source says new ban would affect all stocks
 * Currency derivatives also covered
 * Impact of unilateral measure seen limited - analysts
 * Spanish watchdog says German bans ill-judged
 
 (Adds details, quote)
 By Dave Graham
 BERLIN, May 25 (Reuters) - Germany may widen a ban on
speculative trades in financial stocks to cover all shares, a
draft finance ministry document showed on Tuesday.
 The draft said a raft of measures aimed at stabilising
financial markets would include a ""ban on naked short selling of
shares, including derivatives referring thereto.""
 The document did not state whether the proposals were aimed
at all shares or specific companies, and finance ministry
officials were not immediately available for comment.
 One government source, speaking to Reuters on condition
anonymity, said it was intended to apply to all shares traded in
Germany.
 A week ago, Germany caught markets and its European Union
partners unawares when the government's financial watchdog
announced a ban on naked short-selling of shares of Germany's
top 10 financial institutions, and of euro government bonds and
related credit default swaps.
 Tuesday's news, by contrast, had little market impact, and
traders and economists questioned the efficacy of such a ban.
 ""This is an isolated step in a globalised world,"" said
Christoph Schmidt, the head of Germany's RWI economics
institute. ""Hence it could simply have no impact.""
 The finance ministry draft did not list specific shares to
be affected.
 But it said there was also a proposal to introduce a
""transparency system for naked short-selling positions"", and the
ban would also cover euro currency derivatives not used for
hedging.
 Naked short selling involves selling securities without
owning or borrowing the underlying assets in the hope of buying
them back at a lower price.
 In contrast to the sharp fall in the euro and shares
prompted by last week's announcement, a share trader in
Frankfurt said the news was having a limited impact.
""As long as Germany is doing this alone, I really see it as
very questionable. The G20 countries would need to act together,
but there would always be a chance to find a hole,"" he said.
""Too much regulation is also not going to help.""
 Regulatory activity is picking up internationally, which
German financial watchdog Bafin cited on Tuesday as a reason for
postponing its annual news conference for a second time. This
one had been scheduled for June 1, but Bafin cancelled it due to
""many international meetings organised at short notice"".
 The head of Spain's stock market regulator CNMV, Julio
Segura, said Germany's crackdown on short selling was
ill-judged.
 ""The regulatory changes ... encouraged by the German
government are heading in the wrong direction,"" Segura said
during an address to parliament.
 ""If what we are trying to do is just ban or hamper every
kind of bet on the downside ... then we would have to ban
selling debt futures, or call options, which would be
ridiculous,"" he added.
 A second trader in Hanover said: ""As long as other European
countries don't go along, such a ban is really meaningless.""

 May 25 (Reuters) - Reactions to the legislative programme of
Britain's new government presented by Queen Elizabeth on
Tuesday:
 JOHN CRIDLAND, CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY
 ""The coalition is right to put deficit reduction and
securing economic growth at the heart of its first Queen's
Speech.
 ""National Insurance Contributions are a tax on jobs and
reducing next year's increase to the employers' contribution is
the right move at a time when we want to encourage businesses to
create jobs. This is good news for firms of all sizes.
 ""Businesses are greatly encouraged by the prospect of a
five-year roadmap for reform of the corporation tax system.""
 
 OXFAM
 ""A Robin Hood Tax on financial transactions could be used to
fund ... changes in the welfare system, rather than increasing
VAT, which would undoubtedly be felt by the poorest first.""
""We warmly welcome the government's confirmation they will
honour their commitment to spend 0.7 percent of Gross National
Income on overseas aid from 2013 ... However, the coalition
government has missed a key opportunity to follow through on its
promise to enshrine this commitment in law.""
 
 PAUL COOK, TEARFUND, DEVELOPMENT CHARITY
 ""It's not enough to see overseas development assistance
simply reiterated as a government commitment. We need to see
development aid spending at 0.7 percent of Gross National Income
made law, as laid out in last week's coalition agreement.""
 
 DAVID NUSSBAUM, WWF ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP
 ""The UK needs a revolution in the way we think about and
source our energy, and we strongly support the Bill announced in
today's Queen's Speech. The proposed implementation of an
emissions performance standard, provided it is set at the right
level, could prevent saddling us to a new generation of
polluting coal-fired power plants. Furthermore, the delivery of
a smart grid will be crucial for the UK's low carbon future.""
 
 MARK SERWOTKA, PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES UNION
 ""We are deeply concerned about the further erosion of state
services that have been built up over many years and which
millions of people rely on. We are not only committed to
defending our members' jobs and livelihoods, but we are also
calling for a major coalition of trade unions and community
groups to come together to fight these cuts and defend public
services.""

 BILLY HAYES, COMMUNICATION WORKERS UNION
 (On plans to part-privatise state-owned Royal Mail)
 ""We will fight these proposals. There's no mandate from the
public to privatise Britain's postal services. It's not
supported by the public and it's not supported by postal
workers.""
 
 CHRISTINE BLOWER, NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS
 (On plans to allow more state-funded schools to opt out of
local authority control and become independent ""academy""
schools):
 ""Creating academies on the scale proposed by the government
will have the effect of transferring billions of pounds of
publicly funded assets in the form of buildings and land into
the hands of private sponsors...
 ""This is a retrograde step which will cause social division
and planning gridlock, and drive a bulldozer through properly
accountable local authority provision of education.""
 
 MARY BOUSTED, ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS AND LECTURERS
 ""These proposals to turn more schools into academies are
just irresponsible. They have not been properly thought through
and could end up making a mess of education provision through
their unintended consequences.""
 
 
 DAVID FROST, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE
 ""We are pleased that the government is prioritising a
reduction in the budget deficit -- and that it has broadly
chosen to avoid placing additional regulatory burdens on
wealth-creating businesses. Over the coming weeks, we will be
judging the government's performance against the delivery of a
clear plan to enable business growth.""
 
 
 DAVE PRENTIS, PUBLIC SECTOR TRADE UNION UNISON
 ""The plans set out in this dismal Queen's Speech spell
danger for public services, and for economic growth and offer
little hope to either the young or long-term jobless.
 ""With the recovery at an embryonic stage, it is vital that
support for growth is maintained. Cutting public services and
jobs now will hit local economies, stunting economic growth, and
ultimately force long-term borrowing up.""

 By Jan Strupczewski and Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, May 25 (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial new orders
rose in March at their fastest rate in 10 years, data showed on
Tuesday, suggesting economic activity is likely to pick up
strongly in the second quarter in an export-led surge.
 The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said
industrial new orders in the 16 countries using the euro jumped
5.2 percent month-on-month for a 19.8 percent year-on-year rise,
well ahead of expectations.
 The monthly rise was the highest since June 2007 and the
annual increase the strongest in a decade, reinforcing a
positive picture for the region's manufacturers driven by demand
from abroad while domestic economies struggle.
 ""The global economic backdrop is extremely positive. We have
also seen a fall in the euro so the export situation still looks
very good,"" said Nick Kounis, economist at Fortis Bank.
 ""There are of course clouds on the horizon especially on the
domestic side, where we see heightened economic uncertainty
added to additional fiscal tightening and more generally
continued weak dynamics for domestic demand.""
 In terms of euro zone GDP, he said he expected an ""extremely
positive"" second quarter, followed by a slowdown in growth
rates.
 The region's economy grew only modestly in the first quarter
after stalling in the fourth, but stronger than expected March
industrial output also suggested economic activity was picking
up.
 
 GERMAN SURGE
 Industrial new orders point to trends in economic activity
as they translate into production over the coming months.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 2 percent
monthly rise in orders in March and a 14.6 percent annual gain.
 Without the volatile component for ships, planes and trains,
the monthly increase in orders was 4.5 percent and the
year-on-year jump 20.2 percent.
 Orders in the euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, rose 5.7
percent on the month and surged 31 percent year-on-year.
 ""The orders and production data do tend to have closely
related trends and so the continued strength in manufacturing
orders bodes well for the general direction of industrial
production in the months ahead,"" said James Ashley, economist at
Barclays Capital.
 Economists have said euro zone growth is likely to
accelerate to 0.5 percent in the second quarter after 0.2
percent growth in the first three months of the year and
stagnation in the last three months of 2009.

 * Examples include nuclear arms deal, thaw with Poland
 * Baltics, EU powers, India, China top priority list
 
 By Michael Stott
 MOSCOW, May 25 (Reuters) - Russia has discovered a new
ideology in its foreign policy: money.
 Cold War-style tirades against the West are out. In has come
a new friendly face for investors and business, which advertises
pragmatism and profit over ideology and invective.
 A leaked Russian Foreign Ministry draft of the new policy
this month set diplomats' tongues wagging. But experts say
Moscow has been implementing it for some time already, with
President Dmitry Medvedev in the vanguard.
 ""If you look at the treaty on strategic nuclear weapons
signed with the United States, the improved relations with
Poland, the agreement with Norway on Arctic sea borders...you
see a warming on a broad front towards the West,"" said Igor
Yurgens, head of INSOR, a think-tank sponsored by the Kremlin.
 ""If that is not a new foreign policy, then what is?""
 But behind Russia's new focus lies a cold reality: Moscow
needs foreign money and knows it must behave in order to get it.
 The 2008 global financial crisis hit Russia much harder than
the Kremlin anticipated, pushing GDP down 7.9 percent last year.
Over-leveraged Russian companies, which owed over $450 billion,
found their access to Western capital cut off. The weaknesses of
Russia's uncompetitive oil-fuelled economy were cruelly exposed.
 The government responded with a campaign to modernise.
 ""The economic crisis has eliminated the hubris that marked
the end of the Putin presidency,"" said Dmitry Trenin, director
of the Moscow Carnegie Centre think-tank.
 ""If you accept that unless you modernise, you are
marginalised, and if you accept that you can't modernise on your
own....then your foreign policy is quite clear. You need to
reach out to developed countries that can become resources for
your modernisation.""
 The Kremlin certainly has plenty of ground to make up.
 In 2007, then-president Vladimir Putin made headlines with a
speech upbraided the United States for trying to dominate the
world with ""an almost uncontained use of military force"".
 The following year, Russia responded to a Georgian attack on
a pro-Russian rebel region by invading the U.S. ally, helping to
trigger a meltdown on the Russian stock market.
 At home, developments have not been helpful either. Despite
Medvedev's promises of reform, foreign investors still complain
of rampant corruption, untrustworthy courts, stifling
bureaucracy and poor protection for property rights.
 Medvedev himself lamented at a Kremlin meeting on investment
in February that foreign direct investment in Russia had slumped
41 percent last year and the country occupied 120th place on a
list of 183 nations ranked by ease of doing business.
 
 SMILING FACE?
 In an interview with a Danish journalist in April, the
president addressed Russia's image problem. When asked what face
Moscow should present to the outside world, he replied:
 ""The one that I have now: a smiling face... We must not bare
our teeth at anyone, get angry, sulk or feel offended, pushed
into a corner... I would like to see Russia smiling and taking
the face of a young modern person.""
 The leaked foreign policy document, published by Russian
Newsweek but not officially confirmed by the Foreign Ministry or
the Kremlin, lists 61 priority countries for relations.
 These include the neighbouring Baltic republics -- where it
says cheap assets are for sale -- and key EU business partners
Germany, Italy and France, but also big Russian arms clients
such as India, China and Venezuela.
 Whether global investors preoccupied with the eurozone
crisis will notice Moscow's efforts is another matter.
 ""The Russian charm offensive has unfortunately been lost
amid the overall market confusion globally,"" said Roland Nash,
head of research at Moscow investment bank Renaissance Capital.
 ""At the moment they are whispering into a hurricane.""
 Diplomats say the still-powerful hardliner faction in the
Russian elite are far from won over to the new friendlier
foreign policy and want the country to hedge its bets.
 ""They believe the crisis proved Russia was wrong to rely on
Western money,"" one envoy said. ""And they don't believe Obama is
for the long term -- they want Moscow to be ready for a return
of the Pentagon hawks in Washington in a few years.""
 Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Russian investment bank
Uralsib, believes that Putin's failed attempt last year to
broker a deal for Russia to invest in German carmaker Opel was a
good example of how Moscow wants to use its investor-friendly
foreign policy to assist economic modernisation at home.
 ""Russia needs to get companies such as Opel to invest in
Russia and to work with their Russian counterparts to help the
domestic industry to become more efficient and to modernise
quickly,"" he said in e-mailed comments.
 But the immediate beneficiaries of the new business-
friendly foreign policy have largely been Russian state-
controlled companies and banks rather than the private sector.
 Putin has helped negotiate a string of deals around the
world benefiting state oil major Rosneft, gas giant Gazprom,
state nuclear agency Rosatom and arms exporter Rosoboronexport.
 ""Putin has become something of a super-salesman or
negotiator for these companies to get deals,"" Weafer noted.
 Putin's penchant for cutting deals on foreign trips has
occasionally led to awkward moments. One EU ambassador recalls a
meeting with his head of government when Putin tried to
negotiate terms of an energy deal and was surprised to be told
that this was not something the prime minister did.
 ""Well, that's what I do and I'm a prime minister,"" Putin is
said to have replied.
 Carnegie's Trenin says that the motto ""Russia's business is
business"" first appeared in Putin's second term from 2004-8.
 ""A lot of people thought (after the Georgia war) that Russia
was in the business of... grabbing territory and invading
neighbours,"" he said.
 ""But they're not interested in land-grabbing. They're
interested in succeeding in business the way they see business,
that is the bunch of people who at the same time rule the
country and own the country. Russia Inc. is them.""

818,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2010 07:07AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-New UK governments sets out its plans," LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Britain's new coalition
government set out its goals and plans for legislation over the
next 18 months on Tuesday.
 These are some of the aims of the Conservative-Liberal
Democrat government formed after the May 6 election.

GOALS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE LEGISLATION
 
 BUDGET DEFICIT
 The new government set reducing the deficit and restoring
economic growth as its top priority. An emergency budget on June
22 will set out a plan to eliminate the bulk of the structural
deficit over the next five years.
 
 TAX SYSTEM
 Create a fairer tax system to help those on lower and middle
incomes. The government will announce a significant increase in
the personal allowance for income tax in its first budget. The
basic state pension will increase in line with average earnings
from April 2011.
 IMMIGRATION
 The government wants an annual limit on non-European Union
economic migrants admitted to Britain but has set no numbers,
beyond saying it wants to limit net migration to tens of
thousands of people a year.
 
 HOUSE OF LORDS
 The government will make proposals to replace the current
unelected upper house of parliament with a chamber that is
wholly or mainly elected on the basis of proportional
representation.
 
 HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND, HIGH-SPEED RAIL
 The government will encourage investment in new high-speed
broadband Internet connections and ""enable the construction"" of
a high-speed rail network.
 
 PLANNED LEGISLATION
 
 OFFICE OF BUDGET RESPONSIBILITY
 Create an independent Office for Budget Responsibility,
headed by former Bank of England policymaker Alan Budd, to
publish fiscal forecasts and recommendations.
 
 NATIONAL INSURANCE
 Increase rates of National Insurance Contributions (NICs), a
payroll tax, from April 2011. This will raise 9 billion pounds
($12.87 billion), which will be used to finance an increase in
the income tax personal allowance and a rise in the NICs
threshold.
 
 WELFARE REFORM
 Simplify the benefits system to improve work incentives.
 
 PENSION AND SAVINGS BILL
 Review plans to to raise the state pension age to 66 between
2024 and 2026 followed by two further increases at 10-year
intervals.
 
 FINANCIAL REFORM
 Give the Bank of England control of macro-prudential
regulation -- the financial system as a whole, and oversight of
micro-prudential regulation -- the day-to-day business of
individual institutions.
 
 EQUITABLE LIFE
 Permit payments to policyholders of British insurance firm
Equitable Life [EQL.UL] who lost money after the company nearly
collapsed in 2000.
 
 PUBLIC BODIES REFORM BILL
 Cut the cost of bureaucracy and number of public bodies,
producing expected year-on-year savings of one billion pounds.
 
 AIRPORT REGULATION
 Reform the economic regulation of airports to benefit
passengers. Having ruled out new runways in the heavily
populated southeast of England, the government plans to drive
investment in airport facilities for passengers and remove
unnecessary regulation.
 POSTAL SERVICES
 Part-privatise state-owned mail carrier Royal Mail
[GBPO.UL], which faces a pension fund deficit estimated at up to
10 billion pounds. The plan could face resistance from unions.
 ENERGY
 Improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses. Create a
framework to deliver secure, low-carbon energy supplies and fair
competition in energy markets. Legislation may contain measures
to regulate carbon emissions from coal-fired power stations,
reform energy markets, set a framework to develop a ""smart""
electricity grid and create a ""green"" investment bank.
 
 ACADEMIES
 Enable more schools to become academies and give teachers
greater freedom over the curriculum.
 
 PARLIAMENTARY REFORM
 Introduce fixed-term, five-year parliaments and pave the way
for a referendum on the alternative vote electoral system to
replace the current first-past-the-post system.
 
 FREEDOM BILL
 Scrap the previous Labour government's plans for identity
cards and restrict the scope of the existing DNA database.
 
 EUROPEAN UNION
 Give voters a say in a referendum on any future proposed
transfer of power to the European Union. No government would be
able to join the euro single currency without voter approval.

 By Nick Edwards and Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will watch
the U.S. economy's progress through autumn and into 2011 as it
decides how long it will hold interest rates at ultra-low
levels, a top Fed official said on Tuesday.
 In an interview with Reuters Insider television in London,
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard also said
the U.S. economic recovery was on track and that the Fed was
keeping a close eye on risks stemming from the euro debt crisis.
 He said the Fed could not make any promises on when it would
change its monetary policy stance. In the latest Reuters poll,
10 out of 17 primary dealers see the first Fed rate hike coming
in 2011.
 ""The economy is doing fairly well so far,"" Bullard said.
 ""We have some risk, we have the situation in Europe we're
watching very closely, but we'll see how things proceed through
the fall and into 2011.""
 He said modest take-up of new dollar liquidity lines
suggested there was less stress in the banking system than after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
 Bullard said the Fed was mindful of future risks the euro
debt crisis may have on the U.S. economy.
 ""There is some risk that the European crisis will morph into
something larger,"" he said.
 But he added: ""As of today, because of bank guarantees, I
can't really see it going through into the global banking
system.""
 As the euro zone grapples with fiscal problems in Greece and
other countries, Bullard said some form of sovereign debt
restructuring in the 16-member bloc would not be disastrous.
 ""If there is some restructuring some day, it's not really
the end of the world. It can be done,"" he said. ""It's very
painful for the country ... and it can incite a lot of
volatility in the markets, but it's not the end of the world by
itself.""

 * Kremlin boss says developed countries holding Russia back
 * Says Russia may become too dependent on foreign technology
 
 By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, May 25 (Reuters) - Russia must become more
self-sufficient in high technology equipment and avoid relying
on shoddy, ageing imports, President Dmitry Medvedev's chief of
staff said in an article published on Monday.
 Sergei Naryshkin, the highest ranking Kremlin official after
the president, warned that Russia needed to take immediate steps
to ensure its economic security.
 Developed countries were using export finance to make
Russian companies buy ageing machinery, often decades old,
hindering Russia's development, he wrote in the Voprosy
Ekonomiki academic journal.
 ""Russia is thus helping developed countries to replace
outdated machinery and modernise while it frequently remains on
the sidelines of global innovation processes, losing national
competitiveness,"" he said.
 Naryshkin did not mention any specific companies or
countries, but the comments from such a senior Kremlin official
indicate that Russia could try to increase regulation of
technology and machinery imports.
 Russia has used trade barriers and incentives to force major
foreign car makers to open assembly lines in Russia.
 ""In the foreseeable future, the main threat to Russia's
economic security is the loss of self-sufficiency in the
innovational development of production facilities,"" Naryshkin
wrote.
 ""The country may become increasingly -- and later
irreversibly -- dependent on foreign innovation ideas, including
technologies, types of products and management,"" he added.
 While Russia's economy boomed from 1999 to 2008, companies
snapped up machinery in Europe, the United States and Asia to
replace decrepit Soviet-era plants.
 Even as the economy slumped during the crisis, telecoms
giants Vimpelcom and MTS used export finance to buy equipment
from foreign producers such as Sweden's Ericsson and Nokia
Siemens Networks.
 President Medvedev says the severity of the crisis -- which
inflicted Russia's worst annual economic decline since 1994 --
has shown the need to reduce reliance on oil, gas and metals by
developing the high-technology and processing sectors.
 Naryshkin said Russia should influence investment flows,
encouraging investment in higher added value sectors, with
foreign investment contributing to ""demand for national
innovation products"".
 He also said Russia should create a system of ""investment
security management"" which would help identify the potential
consequences of investment activity, saying that developed
countries already have such a system in place.

(Adds reaction, analyst comment)
 By Keith Weir
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Britain's new coalition
government set out plans on Tuesday to reform the electoral
system and cut state interference in people's lives, while
tackling a record budget deficit.
 The Conservative-Liberal Democrat alliance, Britain's first
coalition for 65 years, also plans to allow private investment
in state-owned distribution business Royal Mail, setting the
scene for an early clash with trades unions who sharply
criticised the new government's programme.
 In a speech delivered on its behalf by Queen Elizabeth at
the formal state opening of parliament, the government also
proposed legislation to give British people a say on any
transfer of powers to the European Union.
 Analysts said the programme of 22 bills, to go before
parliament between now and late next year, was an ambitious
start to a new era after Labour lost power for the first time
since 1997.
 The centre-right Conservatives and smaller, left-leaning Lib
Dems took office after an election on May 6, swiftly smoothing
over differences on issues such as when to start cutting a
deficit running at over 11 percent of national output.
 The Treasury set out plans on Monday to trim an initial 6.2
billion pounds from the deficit.
 Further cuts are expected to follow in an emergency budget
to be presented in four weeks and the deficit issue cast a long
shadow over the programme.
 ""The first priority is to reduce the deficit and restore
economic growth,"" the Queen said in her speech.
 ""Action will be taken to accelerate the reduction of the
structural budget deficit. A new Office for Budget
Responsibility will provide confidence in the management of the
public finances.""
 The office will be led by economist Alan Budd and will take
on the task of forecasting economic growth and borrowing needs.
 Figures published earlier on Tuesday showed Britain's
economy grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of the year in
a modest recovery from an 18-month recession.
 
 PROTECTING LIBERTIES
 The coalition tapped into a sense the Labour government had
extended its reach too far into the lives of ordinary Britons by
proposing a Freedom (Great Repeal) Bill to limit the use of
CCTV, the storage of DNA samples and e-mail records and to
protect the right to peaceful protest.
 Led by Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and his Lib
Dem deputy Nick Clegg, the government is enjoying a political
honeymoon, with media largely supportive and markets calmed by
first steps on the deficit.
 An ICM poll published in the Guardian's Tuesday edition
found nearly two-thirds of voters approved of the coalition.
 However, unions, who traditionally back Labour, signalled
that they would give the government a rough ride.
""We are deeply concerned about the further erosion of state
services that have been built up over many years and which
millions of people rely on,"" said Mark Serwotka, head of the
Public and Commercial Services Union which has 300,000 members,
many of them civil servants.
He urged unions and community groups to fight cuts and
defend public services.
 Analysts said the acid test would be how the coalition hung
together when managing unexpected turbulence.
 ""All in all, it's so far, so good but it remains to be seen
how much they will be able to do when other events take
precedence,"" said Wolfango Piccoli of political risk consultancy
Eurasia Group.

 By Kim Yeon-hee
 SEOUL, May 25 (Reuters) - South Korean stocks tumbled on
Tuesday and the won slid to a nine-month low after a news
report that North Korea was preparing its military, compounding
a selloff as investors have cut risky positions on worries
about the euro zone debt crisis.
 Few analysts expect a conflict even as tensions have risen,
but the report from the Yonhap news agency rattled investors
who have already yanked funds out of South Korea. The country
is one of investors' favourite plays on Asia's strong economic
growth and expected currency appreciation.
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-il reportedly told his
military it may have to go to war but only if the South attacks
first. The report was based on an online story from May 20 that
came out before the South announced that it would punish its
reclusive neighbour for sinking a warship.
 The sharp drop in the won -- down as much as 13 percent so
far in May and poised for one of its worst monthly drops since
the financial crisis -- has underscored the investor rush for
the exits as they fret about a renewed financial crisis
stemming from Europe's debt storm.
 The selloff has added to the pressure on rising dollar
borrowing costs among banks from the mounting money market
strains around the world.
 The benchmark KOSPI index and the won later trimmed losses,
and investors said that the market had likely overreacted.
Korean financial authorities scrambled to respond and planned
to hold an emergency meeting early on Wednesday.
 ""Report of the North's alert for attacks came at a bad
time, when market was fragile with fresh euro zone fears,"" said
a fund manager at a foreign investment house, asking not to be
identified as he was not allowed to speak to media.
 Foreign investors dumped stocks for the seventh trading
session, cashing out of $5 billion worth of shares on the Seoul
bourse since the start of this month -- cutting net purchases
so far this year to $4.4 billion. The country's largest stock,
Samsung Electronics, hit a three-month low.
 But some fund managers see the selling binge should run its
course before long.
 ""At the level of 1,500 points, KOSPI will be at low
valuations over the short term,"" said Jon Jong-woo, a senior
fund manager of Samsung Investment Trust & Management.
 ""Given there will be solutions to European problems,
foreign selling seems to be at the final stages. We do not need
to be so pessimistic.""
 The KOSPI finished down 2.8 percent at 1,560. Technical
indicators suggest the KOSPI is now oversold, with the 14-day
Relative Strength Index falling to 26.8 -- below the oversold
mark of 30.
 CDS AT 10-MTH HIGH, IRS DROP
 The won has been the hardest hit of Asian currencies this
month, in part as investors have unwound euro-funded carry
trades in Asian equities and currencies -- especially the more
liquid won.
 In the past week the won has plunged 8 percent against the
single European currency.
 The won suffered its worst day in more than 14 months to
end at 1,250.0 per dollar, prompting the central bank to
intervene in support of the currency just a month after it had
been seen trying to stem its rise, traders said.
 The won is now poised to fall towards 1,291, the 38.2
percent retracement of its rally since the financial crisis
abated.
 The cost of insuring South Korea's debt against default
jumped to its highest in 10 months, with the sovereign
five-year credit default swap spread jumped 27 basis points to
175 basis points.
 Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday uncertainties from tensions
with North Korea would remain for longer, but the risk premium
on South Korean assets should not affect the economy or
corporate profitability.
 ""If anything, we believe the impact could be positive
because the associated Korean won depreciation against the
Japanese yen would boost Korea's competitiveness further,"" it
said in a note.
 Bonds markets shined. Foreign investors remained net buyers
of the bond futures, showing there was sign of a capital flight
from Asia's fourth-largest economy. The 3-year June treasury
future reversed early losses to rise 14 ticks, and the one-year
Korean swap rate fell to a one-year low as the prospect of a
near-term Bank of Korea rate hike dwindled.
 Matthew Huang, an economist at Barclays Capital, said the
won would stage a rebound soon.
 ""Even compared with Indonesia, the currency has more room
to appreciate,"" he said, expecting 15-20 percent appreciation
over the next year.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro hit a 8 1/2-year low
against the yen and neared a 4-year low versus the dollar on
Tuesday as concerns about the euro zone's fragile banking system
prompted investors to pull back from riskier assets.
 Such concerns fanned strains in money markets, boosting
demand for dollars across the board.
 Weighing on the euro was the Spanish central bank's takeover
of savings bank CajaSur on Saturday after a failed merger with
another regional lender.
 Although CajaSur is relatively small and the Bank of Spain
has said it wants to halve the number of ailing small lenders,
analysts said the bailout highlighted weakness in the European
banking sector and fanned fears more banks may need to be bailed
out by some euro zone members.
 ""Spanish banking fears certainly exacerbate contagion
risks,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 U.S. two-year swap spreads pushed out to their widest in two
years, reflecting tightening money market conditions.
 European shares fell 2.7 percent. U.S. stock futures were
down 2.6 percent, indicating a sharply lower open on Wall Street
after it lost more than 1 percent on Monday.
 Tokyo's Nikkei average hit its lowest in more than five
months, while the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside
Japan slid 3.7 percent.
 By 0916 GMT, the euro fell 1.2 percent on the day at $1.2200
, nearing a four-year low of $1.2143 hit last week.
 Against the yen, the euro fell to 109.36 yen, its lowest
since Dec, 2, 2001, according to Reuters charts. The pair was
down 1.6 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday.
 ""Fears are growing that a collapse in confidence could undo
the positive growth impulses that are still present, with
tensions in money markets resulting in dollar liquidity drying
up,"" said Kenneth Broux, senior market economist at Lloyds TSB.
 The euro has lost more than 7 percent versus the dollar this
month, heading for its biggest monthly fall since January 2009.
 The euro's downside targets stood at the recent low of
$1.2143 and at $1.2133, a 50 percent retracement of a rally from
its all-time low around $0.8225 in October 2000 to its record
peak of $1.6040 touched in July 2008, traders said.
 
 STOPS
 The next support would be the psychologically important
$1.2000, where many stops are believed to be set, they said.
 Funding conditions for banks have also been tightening.
 U.S. dollar 3-month Libor/OIS spreads were sharply wider on
Monday, with the 3-month Libor hitting a 10-month high,
indicating stressed conditions in the money market.
 The dollar index rose 1.2 percent to 87.29. The greenback
dipped 0.4 percent to 89.73 yen.
 Growth-linked currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars saw sharp pullbacks.
 The Aussie dropped more than 2.2 percent against the yen and
1.5 percent against the U.S. dollar as hedge funds and investors
took profits on the higher-yielding currency's rally this year.
 Sterling showed little reaction to data showing Britain's
economy grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of this year,
slightly faster than the 0.2 percent initially estimated.
 Tensions in Korea buoyed the dollar and yen, after South
Korea's Yonhap news agency said North Korean leader Kim Jong-il
had told his troops to prepare for combat.

 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew slightly
faster than initially estimated in the first three months of
this year after a rebound in manufacturing and business
services, but economists expect headwinds to come. 
 The Office for National Statistics said Britain's economy
grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, up from an initial
estimate of 0.2 percent.
 However this rate of growth is a touch slower than the 0.4
percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and is less than half
typical rates experienced in 2006 and 2007, before Britain
suffered its worst recession since at least World War Two.
 On the year, output was down 0.2 percent -- again an upward
revision and its smallest decline since the third quarter of
2008.
 Both revisions were exactly in line with the consensus
expectation of private-sector economists, who had revised up
their view following strong industrial output data for March.
 ""No huge surprises here,"" said Philip Shaw, UK economist at
Investec. ""The uprating of industrial production had already
been flagged by the monthly figures.""
 Britain's finance ministry -- which plans a major spending
squeeze under the newly elected Conservative/Liberal Democrat
coalition -- said the upward revision was welcome, but noted
output was still 5.5 percent below its pre-recession peak.
 Sterling and British government bond prices were little
changed on the news.
 A breakdown showed that industrial production rose by 1.2
percent on the quarter, its largest rise since the first quarter
of 2006. Business services and finance grew by 0.7 percent,
their strongest pace since the first quarter of 2008.
 However household spending showed no growth on the quarter
and general government spending grew by just 0.5 percent, its
slowest in a year.
 There was a sharp 0.7 percent fall in hotels, distribution
and catering output, which economists blamed on unusually snowy
weather at the start of the year and a rise in value-added tax.
 ""This was an okay quarter, given we know there were
obstructions such as snow and the VAT hike which have clearly
held back consumption,"" said Alan Clarke, UK economist at BNP
Paribas.
 Some economists interpreted the lack of growth in household
expenditure as a sign that the British economy was rebalancing
towards export-driven growth, unlike the pre-recession boom
which had been driven by consumer spending.
 The data confirmed upward inflation pressures shown in
consumer and producer price data this year. The implied GDP
deflator -- a measure of price pressures across the economy as a
whole -- rose by 1.7 percent on the quarter, more than double
the rate in the fourth quarter of last year and the biggest
increase since 1996.
 Year-on-year, the deflator showed a 3.6 percent rise in
prices, and wages rose at a quarterly pace of 1.2 percent, their
fastest in two years.
 The growth figures confirm economists' views that Britain is
recovering from an 18-month recession that knocked more than 6
percent off economic output. However, there are headwinds to
come, not least from ongoing debt market turbulence in the euro
zone, Britain's biggest trading partner, and a sharp squeeze on
public spending.
 ""We continue to look for only very weak growth in coming
quarters,"" said James Knightley at ING.
 ""Our pessimistic assessment is based on poor household
fundamentals and aggressive fiscal policy tightening, while
financial market weakness is also a concern.""

 * Says China to lower investment barriers in key sectors
 * Confident Europe can manage fallout from debt crisis
 By Glenn Somerville
 BEIJING, May 25, (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner on Tuesday welcomed a pledge by China's top leaders to
pursue currency reform as part of a broader agenda aimed at
boosting domestic consumption and helping rebalance global growth.
 In a statement at the close of a two-day Strategic and
Economic Dialogue, Geithner said letting markets have more sway
on currency values will benefit China by giving it more tools to
keep inflation contained.
 He also cited progress in persuading Beijing to let U.S.
firms compete more equally in Chinese markets.
 He said the discussions with Chinese leaders on the yuan were
encouraging but wouldn't speculate when Beijing might let its
yuan rise in value as American lawmakers are demanding it do.
 ""This is of course China's choice,"" he said in the statement.
 In a round of television interviews, Geithner was asked how
he interpreted remarks Chinese President Hu Jintao's remarks on
Monday that it will continue exchange rate reform at its own pace.
 ""Encouraging, promising,"" Geithner said on Bloomberg
Television. """"But again, I'm going to leave it to them to
characterize what their plans are.""
 U.S. politicians and some business groups maintain that
China keeps its yuan at an artificially low level that gives its
products an unfair price advantage in America's consumer markets.
 The yuan had risen about 21 percent between 2005 and mid-2008
when Beijing repegged it to try to add stability during the
turmoil stemming from the global financial crisis.
 Geithner said he was ""as confident as I've ever been"" that
China will see that it is in its own interest to let the yuan,
also called the renminbi, resume appreciating.
 Throughout his visit to China, Geithner has stressed that a
recovery in the United States and elsewhere has been gathering
steam, indirectly suggesting that China no longer had as strong
of a case for maintaining the currency peg.
 Asked about U.S. objections to Chinese industrial policies
aimed at promoting domestic high-tech leaders, Geithner said he
was hopeful that Beijing would be ""sensitive and responsive"" to
concerns that its so-called ""indigenous innovation"" policies
might discriminate against U.S. companies.
 ""But let me just say American companies are doing very well
in China. What they're concerned about is to make sure that going
forward, they're going to compete on a level playing field,"" he
said.
 Geithner heads for Britain and Germany on Tuesday night,
where he will discuss European efforts to stabilize its financial
markets in the wake of a debt crisis that has made investors edgy
about the region and driven down the euro's value.
 ""I'm completely certain that Europe has the ability to manage
this,"" Geithner said. The European Union has agreed on a
trillion-dollar package to deal with financial strains in the
region if necessary and, in conjunction with the International
Monetary Fund, put together a bailout package for financially
strapped Greece.
 In an interview with Fox Business Network, he said that what
was necessary now was to put the support measures in place.
 ""The most important thing is that Europe act with force and
care and speed...,"" Geithner said.
 He repeated, as he had earlier to a group of middle-aged
students at a school that trains future regional leaders, that
the Obama administration is committed to lower record budget
deficits -- though only after it is certain economic recovery is
assured.
 ""It's critically important to the United States, important to
the strength of recovery and to future U.S. growth, that we act
to bring our deficits down quickly and substantially as the
economy strengthens, "" he said.
 Geithner meets Britain's new Chancellor of the Exchequer,
George Osborne, in London on Wednesday and then travels on to
Frankfurt to meet European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet. On Thursday, he flies to Berlin for a meeting with
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble before returning to
Washington.

elections and sending the crown down versus the euro and dollar.
 Unemployment, which analysts had expected to drop slightly
to 9.0 percent from 9.1 percent in March, in fact rose sharply
to 9.8 percent in April, the statistics office said on Tuesday,
catching the market off guard.
 The centre-right Alliance government, under pressure to
prove it can deliver on campaign promises of creating jobs, has
fallen further behind the centre-left opposition in recent polls
with less than four months to go to the national vote.
 ""Of course, if it should turn out that the labour market is
changing from an improving trend to moving sideways or even
deteriorating, it could be a factor (in the election), but it's
too early to make that call,"" Danske analyst Michael Grahn said.
 Reacting to the drop, the Swedish crown slid to its weakest
level against the dollar since May 2009. It was trading at 8.04
per dollar at 0745 GMT after reaching a low of 8.05. This was
the weakest since May 2009 when it fell as far as 8.08.
 ""The market is pricing out the risk for raised rates at the
end of June, which is reflected in the crown,"" said Henrik
Gullberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
 In comments ahead of a July 1 meeting, the Swedish central
bank has been leaning toward raising its key policy rate from a
record low of 0.25 percent for the first time in almost two
years, citing improvement in the outlook for jobs.
 But with the scenario for a quick labour market turnaround
now in question, analysts said there was more weight behind
arguments to delay the first hike until September.
 ""We have been of the opinion that unemployment has reached a
turning point now, and this naturally raises some questions
marks regarding that view,"" said Olle Holmgren at SEB. ""On the
margin, this could affect the rate path.""
 SCB said total employment, which does not include government
job schemes, was 4.465 million versus 4.449 million in the
previous month.

833,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2010 04:35AM ET</span>",UK Q1 GDP revised up slightly as expected," LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew slightly
faster than initially estimated in the first three months of
this year after a strong rebound in industrial production and
business services, official data showed on Tuesday.
 The Office for National Statistics said Britain's economy
grew by 0.3 percent in the first quarter, up from an initial
estimate of 0.2 percent, though slower than the 0.4 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2009.
 On the year, output was down 0.2 percent -- again an upward
revision and its smallest decline since the third quarter of
2008.
 Both revisions were exactly in line with the consensus
expectation of private-sector economists, who had revised up
their view following strong industrial output data for March.
 A breakdown showed that industrial production rose by 1.2
percent on the quarter, its largest rise the first quarter of
2006. Business services and finance grew at their strongest pace
since the first quarter of 2008.
 However household spending showed no growth on the quarter
and general government spending grew by just 0.5 percent, its
slowest in a year. There was a sharp 0.7 percent fall in hotels,
distribution and catering output.
 The figures are likely to confirm economists' view that
Britain is recovering slowly from its worst recession since at
least World War Two, but there are headwinds to come, not least
from ongoing economic turbulence in the euro zone, Britain's
biggest trading partner, and what is likely to be the tightest
public spending squeeze in a generation.

 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - World stocks slid to their lowest
since Sept 2009, the euro eyed four-year lows and U.S. stock
futures pointed to sharp falls on Wall Street on Tuesday, on
euro zone banking worries and geopolitical risk in Korea.
 The central bank takeover of a small Spanish lender at the
weekend reminded investors that the world is only just
recovering from a banking crisis, following weeks of anxiety
over how to stop the Greek debt crisis from spreading.
 Markets tumbled in a catch-up move following holidays in
many European countries on Monday, with investors seeming to
have lost faith in the euro zone's recent 750 billion euro
markets stabilisation package.
 ""There now appear to be deeper-rooted misgivings about the
health of the global economy,"" said Owen Ireland, analyst at ODL
Securities.
 ""This morning's dramatic falls may keep money out of the
markets for a while until we see a semblance of order return.""
 Across the globe, North Korea threatened military action if
the South continued to violate its waters off the west coast,
further stoking tension on the peninsula after the sinking of a
south Korean warship.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI fell 2 percent to their
lowest since early Sept 2009, while the more volatile emerging
stocks index dropped over 3 percent to 8-/2 month lows.
 U.S. stock futures fell more than 2 percent, indicating a
sharp decline on Wall Street, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst
300 index of top shares slid more than 3 percent to nine-month
lows.
 The euro dropped over 1 percent below $1.22, hovering above
recent four-year lows, and slid more than 2 percent against the
yen.
 
 SAFE HAVENS
 The sell-off has benefited U.S. and other assets seen as a
safe haven from the storm spreading across southern Europe.
German Bund futures hit a record high at 129.55, while 10-year
yields were at their lowest ever.
 The dollar rose over 1 percent to 87.28 against a basket of
currencies and 10-year U.S. Treasuries jumped 24/32 to 103-11,
yielding 3.1091 percent.
 The Federal Reserve will watch the U.S. economy's progress
through autumn and into 2011 as it decides how long it will hold
interest rates at ultra-low levels, St. Louis Federal Reserve
Bank President James Bullard said in an interview with Reuters
Insider television.
 Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to $67.87 but spot gold
steadied at $1,192.10.
 Meanwhile, funding conditions for banks have been
tightening, with institutions in the United States increasingly
reluctant to deal with firms with large exposure to Europe.
 Three-month dollar LIBOR rates rose to their highest since
late July 2009.
 ""If a US$1 trillion-equivalent bail-out did not finally turn
sentiment, I struggle to see what can,"" said RBS strategist Tim

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday as
concern about the euro zone's banking system fanned strains in
money markets, boosting demand for dollars across the board.
 Weighing on the euro was the Spanish central bank's takeover
of savings bank CajaSur on Saturday after a failed merger with
another regional lender.
 Although CajaSur is relatively small, analysts said the
bailout highlighted weakness in the European banking sector and
fanned fears that more banks may need to be bailed out by some
euro zone members that are already saddled with heavy debt.
 ""Spanish banking fears certainly exacerbate contagion
risks,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 In the money market, U.S. two-year swap spreads pushed out
to their widest in two years, reflecting tightening funding
conditions.
 European shares fell 2.7 percent in early trade. Tokyo's
Nikkei average hit its lowest in more than five months, while
the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 3.7
percent. That came after Wall Street fell more than 1 percent
overnight.
 By 0822 GMT, the euro fell 1.0 percent on the day against
the dollar to a session low of $1.2230 and was last at $1.2231.
 The euro has lost more than 7 percent against the dollar so
far this month, heading for its biggest monthly fall since
January 2009.
 The euro's downside targets are a four-year low of $1.2143
hit last week and $1.2133, a 50 percent retracement of a rally
from its all-time low around $0.8225 in October 2000 to its
record peak of $1.6040 touched in July 2008, traders said.
 If it falls below that level the next support would be the
psychologically important level of $1.2000, where many stops are
believed to be set, they said.
 The euro fell 1.3 percent to 109.78 yen, nearing an
eight-year low of 109.47 yen hit on trading platform EBS last
week.
 Funding conditions for banks have also been tightening, with
firms in the United States increasingly reluctant to deal with
firms with large exposure to Europe, a move analysts say
reflects growing risk aversion.
 U.S. dollar 3-month Libor/OIS spreads were sharply wider on
Monday, with the 3-month Libor hitting a 10-month high,
indicating stressed conditions in the money market.
 The dollar index rose 1.0 percent to 87.11. The greenback
dipped 0.3 percent to 89.82 yen.
 In a generalised mood of risk aversion, growth-linked
currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars also
saw sharp pullbacks.
 The Australian dollar dropped more than 2.2 percent against
the yen and more than 1.5 percent against the U.S. dollar as
hedge funds and investors took profits on the higher-yielding
currency's rally this year.
 The New Zealand dollar fell to a nine-month low of $0.6610,
down 1.2 percent on the day.
 Tensions in the Korean peninsula also buoyed the dollar and
yen, after South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported North
Korean leader Kim Jong-il had told his troops to get ready for
combat.

 BEIJING, May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner told future Chinese leaders that the Obama
Administration will cut its budget deficit once it is sure the
economy is safely growing.
 In a speech to about 30 middle-aged cadres at the Central
Party School, Geithner said Washington is aiming to steadily
lower its deficit as a percentage of national output.
 ""The basic strategy is to make sure that our economy is
growing, then institute long-term reforms, and restore the basic
discipline to the budget process that we abandoned in the
previous decade,"" Geithner said.
 China, which holds some $895 billion of U.S. treasury debt,
has previously expressed concern over the size of U.S. deficits
and the safety of Chinese investments.
 Geithner, who heads for London after the conclusion of a
two-day Strategic and Economic Dialogue with China, said leaders
there were also coming to grips with their fiscal woes.
 He expressed confidence that Europe would find a way to meet
""the difficult challenge of trying to restore sustainability"" to
a budgeting process that was no longer working.
 He suggested that the European Union had set out a budget
restraint program that failed to include a mechanism for dealing
with imbalances between member countries.
 ""Europe's leaders recognize that and now are acting
forcefully to put strong reforms in place,"" he said.
 Geither meets new British finance minister George Osborne
before travelling to Frankfurt for meetings with European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and to Berlin for a Thursday
meeting with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.
 Geithner was at pains throughout the China visit to try to
assure Chinese officials that budget discipline was coming back
to the United States.
 ""We went through a period in the United States when it was
popular to think that deficits don't matter,"" he said.
 ""Nobody thinks that today.""
 Both China and the United States share a responsibility to
work toward balanced growth that will benefit the global economy,
he said, adding that the United States would hew to a line of
stricter deficit control.
 ""We are committed to make sure that we will be a source of
stability and growth in the future,"" Geithner told the assembled
students.

experts
 * Govt holds line, says tax won't derail China trade talks
 * Fortescue warns on div, but Gindalbie to go ahead with
mine
 By Amy Pyett
 SYDNEY, May 25 (Reuters) - Australian miners suffered a
setback in their campaign against the nation's proposed new
mining tax on Tuesday, with two constitutional experts saying
that a threatened court challenge was likely to fail.
 Miners including Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Fortescue
Metals Group have lashed out the 40 percent tax proposed by
Canberra this month, saying it undermines the country's
investment-friendly reputation and will hurt the
commodity-dependent economy.
 The country's biggest mining state, Western Australia, is
preparing to mount a possible legal challenge against the levy
on the grounds that it would exceed the central government's
constitutional powers.
 The constitution bars central government from taxing the
property of the six states, and mineral resources are treated
in Australia as though they were the property of the states.
 But the two experts told Reuters on Tuesday that Western
Australia, home to the nation's $28 billion-a-year iron ore
industry, would be very unlikely to overturn the tax in court,
citing the proposed structure of the tax and legal precedents.
 ""Challenges rarely succeed and there haven't been any for
some years, partly because the law itself is pretty clear that
there is great scope for how the Commonwealth (the central
government) levies a tax,"" said Professor George Williams, a
constitutional lawyer at Sydney's University of New South
Wales.
 Another expert agreed, noting that the tax would not,
strictly speaking, apply to mineral resources themselves.
Instead, it would apply to the profits derived from them.
 ""Depending on the drafting of the law it seems that a tax
on company profits derived from resources, which have become
company property, would be unlikely to fall into these limited
categories (of unconstitutional taxes),"" said Peter Mellor, tax
specialist at Melbourne's Monash University.
 LAST OPTION: DEFEAT THE PM?
 A failed legal challenge would leave Western Australia and
miners with only one real option to sink the tax: campaign for
the defeat of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's centre-left
government at general elections widely expected to be held
around October.
 The tax, to apply from 2012, is the centrepiece of Rudd's
re-election campaign. It underpins his promise to return the
budget to surplus by 2012-13, to cut the company tax rate and
to indirectly fund another pledge to boost retirement incomes.
 Rudd unveiled the tax this month, arguing the government
was not receiving its fair share of booming mine profits. He is
gambling that miners will not fulfill their threat to pull
projects -- an increasingly high-stakes bet.
 Iron ore miner Fortescue has alone threatened to pull $15
billion in projects while giant rival, Rio Tinto has put every
local investment plan under review, calling Australia its top
sovereign risk concern because of the tax plan.
 Fears that miners will cancel projects have also
contributed to a recent sharp slide in the Australian dollar
and share market, whose fortunes are tied heavily to
commodities. The mining industry makes up around half of the
nation's exports and around a fifth of the $1.15 trillion stock
market.
 Fortescue added on Tuesday that the tax would delay its
plan to start paying dividends in two years.
 ""Now all our shareholders are facing a future with no
immediate prospect of dividends,"" Chairman Herb Elliott said in
a letter to shareholders.
 BHP has already said it would not rule out a dividend cut
due to the tax.
 But Gindalbie Metals said its key Karara iron ore project
is going ahead with the full support of Ansteel, its Chinese
partner, despite the tax plans.
 ""However, the proposed tax changes will have a significant
impact, as they will reduce the returns for the project and put
planned and possible expansions at risk,"" Gindalbie said in a
statement.
 Shares in Fortescue fell 6 percent on Tuesday, while Rio,
BHP and Gindalbie all fell more than 3 percent in a broad
sell-off linked to European debt concerns.
 TAX WON'T HARM CHINA TIES: GOVT
 The government, which is holding firm on the current
proposal for now, is also dealing with concerns about the tax
from China, Australia's biggest trading partner and top buyer
of its commodities.
 Trade Minister Simon Crean, just back from a trip to China,
said he had reassured officials there that the tax would not
lead to higher prices for major commodities such as iron ore
and coal.
 ""The only time it (the tax) was raised as a concern was in
relation to a potential impact on price,"" Crean told reporters.
""I made it clear the tax will not put upward pressure on
price.""

 * Challenges for banks, debt crises weigh on outlook
* Capital inflows seen recovering slowly
 
 By Martin Dokoupil
DUBAI, May 25 (Reuters) - Economic growth in the Middle East
and North Africa will gain momentum in 2010 along with global
recovery, but challenges to some banking systems weigh on the
outlook, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.
 A potential repricing of sovereign debt due to the Dubai and
Greek debt crises was adding uncertainty to the outlook for the
MENAP region, which also includes Afghanistan and Pakistan, the
IMF said in its regional economic report.
 The region's gross domestic product should expand by 4.2
percent this year after 2.3 percent growth in 2009, but still
short of 5.7 percent seen ahead of the 2008 global credit
crunch.
 The IMF expected governments in the region's oil-exporting
countries such as Saudi Arabia to keep large fiscal stimulus
packages in place this year, helping economies grow.
 ""Clouding this outlook are challenges in banking systems
where credit remains sluggish and losses on non-performing loans
are yet to be fully recognized,"" the global lender said.
 ""Also casting doubt on an otherwise positive outlook -- for
the United Arab Emirates in particular -- is the Dubai World
debt standstill announcement,"" it said.
 The Gulf emirate's flagship firm [DBWLD.UL] reached a deal
to restructure $23.5 billion in debt with its core lenders last
week, but it still needed to secure backing from other
creditors. [ID:nLDE64J06Z]
 The IMF kept growth and inflation forecasts for key regional
economies unchanged in the new report following a release of its
World Economic Outlook last month with cash-rich Qatar well
ahead of its peers with growth seen at 18.5 percent this year.
 Higher oil prices and output should boost oil exports by 31
percent to around $680 billion, more than double exporters'
current account surplus to $140 billion and boost oil-GDP growth
to 4.3 percent in 2010, the IMF said.
 The Fund's baseline forecast for the 2010 average oil price
is $80 a barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude prices  fell in
recent weeks to around $70 a barrel due to persistent concerns
that Europe's debt woes could undermine economic recovery.
 It also said unwinding of the fiscal stimulus beyond 2010
would be warranted, particularly in countries with high debt and
that governments should also start withdrawing support for the
financial sector when recovery becomes evident.
 
 CAPITAL FLOWS
 A majority of oil importers are also experiencing some
pickup in GDP growth, the IMF said, with projected rates ranging
from 3.5 percent in Morocco to more than 8 percent in
Afghanistan. This is supported by rising trade and remittances
that are holding up well.
 However, most governments are cutting back on spending,
while weak European Union demand, stronger real exchange rates
and competition from other emerging markets will hamper
prospects for export growth.
 The IMF also said an uneven recovery of international
capital flows presented a challenge for the MENAP region with
investors seen mainly targeting low-risk assets and bonds.
 ""The region's main sources of inflows in the past -- bank
financing for the oil exporters and foreign direct investment
for the importers -- remain subdued and are not set to recover
quickly,"" it said.

 By Doug Palmer and Lucy Hornby
 BEIJING, May 25 (Reuters) - The United States is concerned
that China's revised proposals to promote innovation will still
discriminate against American firms, U.S. Trade Representative
Ron Kirk said on Tuesday.
 China's officials tried to reassure their U.S. counterparts
on Monday that the latest Chinese draft on ""indigenous
innovation"" policies had resolved U.S. concerns on intellectual
property protection.
 But there could still be some cause for worry, Kirk told
Reuters in an interview during the two-day Strategic and Economic
Dialogue between U.S. and China officials in Beijing.
 ""The challenge is because of the absence of transparency,
(it) leaves a lot a lot of very serious policy questions for our
industry and our team. What we've expressed to China is every
country in the world, right now, is rightfully trying to
incentive innovation,"" Kirk said.
 ""That's not a bad thing, but if you do so in a way that we
think unfairly discriminates and operates to the favour of your
domestic industry versus foreign industries, then that's not a
good thing.""
 Kirk's comments are the first public reaction from U.S.
officials after China said its new rules had satisfied concerns
of American companies and officials.
 During the interview, Kirk also said talks with China were
more focused on dialogue, rather than ""big bang"" achievements,
and that Chinese officials had complained about perceived U.S.
congressional bias against China.
 Kirk also said China's progress in intellectual property
protection and market access barriers could be more important
than its yuan reforms.
 ""All these could be as valuable, if not more valuable

said. ""But all of those go to our underlying ability to come in

 By Glenn Somerville and Chris Buckley
 BEIJING, May 25 (Reuters) - China will chart its own course
on currency reform, top officials from Beijing and Washington
said on Tuesday at the end of talks that both agreed had aired
plenty of disputes while leaving any answers for later.
 The two-day Strategic and Economic Dialogue covered much of
the rough economic and foreign policy terrain that has sometimes
strained ties between the world's biggest and third biggest
economies, including trade and technology barriers, North Korea
and Iran.
 At the end, both Washington and Beijing claimed some victory
on the issue that has dogged economic relations throughout the
year: China's policy of tethering its yuan currency to the
dollar, which the Obama administration says gives Chinese
products an unfair advantage.
 The U.S. said Beijing was heeding those complaints. China
said Washington was heeding Beijing's assertion that it would
steer currency reforms in its own way and own pace.
 At the close of the talks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner said the discussions on the yuan were encouraging but
would not speculate when Beijing might let its yuan rise in
value as American lawmakers have demanded.
 ""This is of course China's choice,"" he said in the
statement.
 Geithner said on Bloomberg Television that he was ""as
confident as I've ever been"" that China will see that it is in
its own interest to let the yuan resume appreciating.
 Chinese Assistant Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said the
U.S. ""clearly understanding China's stance"" on the yuan.
 ""The United States also understands that China will
independently decide on the specific steps of its exchange rate
reforms, based on its own interests, taking into account world
economic conditions and China's own development trends,"" he
said.
 The show of mutual goodwill may for now ward off a flare-up
in tensions over the yuan, which many in U.S. Congress say is a
big part of the reason for their country's trade deficit with
China, which was $226.8 billion in 2009.
 But the talks left unclear whether any possible currency
moves by China will be enough to satisfy critics in Congress.
 China has held its currency at about 6.83 to the dollar
since mid-2008, trying to protect its exporters from the damage
of the global financial crisis. In the three years before then,
the yuan had risen about 21 percent against the dollar.
 In April, Geithner delayed a report on whether China
manipulates its currency, a finding that would trigger increased
pressure on Beijing.
 On Tuesday, he declined to tell reporters when his
department would issue its delayed report. ""That time will
come,"" he said. IMPOSSIBLE TO AGREE ON ALL ISSUES
 Tensions flared between Beijing and Washington in the first
months of 2010, when China denounced U.S. criticism of its
Internet censorship, Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, and
Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader.
 After that stormy start to the year neither side appeared
willing to risk worrying markets with renewed feuding, and the
talks swaddled the hard problems between them in soft words.
 ""It is impossible for the United States and China to agree
on all issues and the two sides will have disagreements and
differences,"" leading Chinese diplomat, State Councillor Dai
Bingguo, said at the end of the meeting..
 He and U.S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said they
agreed on the importance of stability on the Korean Peninsula
after South Korea said North Korea was behind the torpedoing of
one of its warships in March, killing 46 sailors.
 But China steered away from public comments that could
alienate North Korea, a poor and isolated state on China's
northeast border.
 Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai urged calm and
told reporters that it was up to all sides to ""proceed from the
wider context of protecting the peace and stability of northeast
Asia and the Korean Peninsula.""
 Clinton said she had ""productive"" talks with China on
annexes to proposed sanctions on Iran that would detail the
people and firms to be targeted by under a proposed United
Nations Security Council resolution.
 
 FISCAL DISCIPLINE
 China is the world's largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, with
$895.2 billion. Chinese officials, including Premier Wen Jiabao,
last year prodded the Obama administration to avoid pursuing
fiscal policies that could erode the value of those holdings.
 This time, China was quieter about any worries.
 Geithner told an audience of Chinese officials that the
Obama administration was aiming to steadily lower its deficit as
a percentage of national output.
 ""The basic strategy is to make sure that our economy is
growing, then institute long-term reforms, and restore the basic
discipline to the budget process that we abandoned in the
previous decade,"" he said in a speech.

 * Worries about banking sector lead to safety bids
 * Aussie falls nearly 1 pct vs dollar, yen on the day
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro slid on Tuesday as
concerns about a broader contagion to the banking sector from the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone drove investors to sell
the single currency.
 The Australian dollar extended its fall, dropping nearly 1
percent against the U.S. dollar and the yen at one point, as
hedge funds and investors took profits on the higher-yielding
currency's rally this year.
 The euro appeared to have lost most of its hard-fought gains
made last week when it posted its first weekly rise against the
greenback in six weeks. It rose to as high as $1.2673 late last
week.
 Weighing on sentiment towards the euro was news that Spain's
central bank on Saturday took over savings bank CajaSur following
the failure of its planned merger with another regional lender.
 Although CajaSur is relatively small, the bailout highlighted
weakness in the European banking sector and fanned fears that
more banks may need to be bailed out by some euro zone members
that are already saddled with heavy debt, traders said.
 ""Investors have started to sell the euro, believing that
there'll be more banks in trouble, particularly in Southern
Europe,"" said an FX trader at a European bank. ""The euro's fall
has not run its course.""
 These worries about a fresh financial crisis prompted
investors to reduce holdings of risky assets, such as shares,
while seeking the safety of U.S. and Japanese currencies and
government bonds.
 Tokyo's Nikkei stock average dropped to its lowest in more
than five months, while the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan slid 2.7 percent.
 The euro stood at $1.2312, down 0.5 percent from late U.S.
trade on Monday.
 On the back of deepening concerns over Europe's debt woes,
the euro has lost more than 7 percent against the dollar so far
this month, heading for its biggest monthly fall since January
2009.
 The euro fell 0.7 percent to 110.90 yen, sliding towards an
eight-year low of 109.47 yen struck on trading platform EBS last
week.
 It has steadily lost ground this week as European banks and
Asian central banks have stepped up selling.
 Funding conditions for banks have also been tightening, with
firms in the United States increasingly reluctant to deal with
firms with large exposure to Europe, a move analysts say reflects
growing risk aversion.
 ""Investors are selling into every rally in the euro,"" said
Jonathan Cavenagh, currency strategist at Westpac. ""Worries about
the euro debt crisis are showing signs of spilling over to the
banking sector with funding costs rising, albeit from very low
levels. All this will only see more demand for U.S. dollars.""
 The dollar and the Japanese yen tend to gain when there is a
spike in volatility and loss in risk appetite. Indeed, the dollar
index rose 0.6 percent to 86.71.
 Against the Japanese currency, the dollar dipped 0.2 percent
to 90.08 yen.
 The U.S. dollar was also helped by decent economic figures.
Data released on Monday that showed U.S. existing home sales rose
more than expected in April. See
 Traders said with liquidity in the forex market showing signs
of drying up, investors are likely to scramble for safe-haven
dollars. That is likely to keep the downward pressure on
growth-linked currencies like the Australian dollar.
 The Aussie fell 0.5 percent to $0.8210, after sliding as low
as $0.8172, according to Reuters data.
 It has been hit hard as investors take profits on
higher-yielding currencies, plunging over 11 percent so far this
month, on the way to posting its biggest decline since October
2008.
 Against the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar slipped 0.4
percent to 74.02 yen. It dropped as low as 73.63 yen at one
point, down almost 1 percent on the day.
 Traders said the slide in the Aussie/yen is expected to slow
in the near term as there are a number of bids waiting below 73
yen.

 * Euro-zone problems deep-rooted -finmin Kan
 * Sengoku sees big risks of problems affecting Japan, world
(Adds quotes from ministers, details)
 TOKYO, May 25 (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers voiced
worries on Tuesday that the European debt crisis may be prolonged
and badly affect recovery in Japan and the world economy, as
concerns about Europe's banking system continued to weigh on
markets.
 Tokyo's Nikkei average fell 2 percent to its lowest in more
than five months, hit by a decline in the euro that dragged
exporters lower, with fears that the euro zone's troubles may
spread keeping investors wary of holding riskier assets.
 Europe's problems grew at the weekend when the Bank of Spain
took over the running of a small savings bank, CajaSur, after the
failure of its planned merger with another small Spanish lender.
 Fresh signs of problems in Europe's banking system emerged as
it became clear that the European Union's $1 trillion safety net
for euro zone states and a 110 billion euro ($135.7 billion) aid
package for Greece had failed to restore confidence in the
country, where austerity measures have led to violent street
protests.
 ""A broad (rescue) package has been mapped out. I was
expecting markets to settle and my basic view remains unchanged,""
Japanese Finance Minister Naoto Kan told reporters.
 ""The euro problems are very deep-rooted as euro-zone members
share a common currency but fiscal policies are left to each
country. I hope financial markets will calm down gradually.""
 Japan's National Strategy Minister Yoshito Sengoku said he
did not expect euro-zone economies to recover quickly as risks
from European problems would likely extend into the medium to
long term.
 ""Risks are very big"" that European problems may disrupt
recoveries in Japan and world economy, Sengoku told reporters.
 The yen has been surging against the euro and also rising
against the dollar on worries about contagion in Europe's banking
sector following a sovereign debt crisis that is prompting
investors to shun riskier assets.
 A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters by reducing the
competitiveness of their goods sold overseas and their profits
when repatriated.
 Japanese Banking Minister Shizuka Kamei said on Tuesday he
asked the finance minister if there was any way to achieve stable
currencies with international coordination.
 The government kept its assessment of Japan's economy
unchanged in a monthly report on Monday while warning about
Europe and financial markets, as the region's debt crisis sparked
fears of sovereign risk and caused global stock markets to
tumble.

850,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2010 10:19PM ET</span>","INTERVIEW-US, China Eximbanks looking for co-financing project"," By Doug Palmer and Lucy Hornby
 BEIJING, May 25 (Reuters) - The export credit agencies of
China and the United States, which often compete to finance sales
around the world, are looking for a joint project to support
exports from both countries, the head of the U.S. Export-Import
Bank said on Tuesday.
 ""There's been great interest, but we have yet to see a
project where that could really work,"" U.S. Eximbank Chairman
Fred Hochberg told Reuters Insider during a break in high-level
U.S.-China talks on foreign policy and economic challenges facing
the two countries.
 A co-financing arrangement would support jobs in both
countries, he said. For example, the United States would provide
loan guarantees for turbines to build a power plant and China
would arrange for construction.
 ""There's definitely a precedent. We have these agreements
with other Exims, and we have a desire to do that with China,""
Hochberg said.
 Also, both the China and U.S. Eximbanks supported a large
liquified natural gas project in Papau New Guinea, even though
there wasn't a formal co-financing arrangement.
 Most of the time, the U.S. Eximbank finds itself in a tough
competition with China's Eximbank, which is able to offer more
generous terms because it is not bound by rules of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Hochberg
said.
 Meanwhile, during the two-day Strategic and Economic Dialogue
that began on Monday, Hochberg said he was exploring ways to help
China's private sector companies buy more American goods.
 Currently about 94 percent of the U.S. Eximbank's business in
China is with state-owned enterprises or governmental entities,
Hochberg said.
 ""The Chinese have a desire to help their private sector grow
and really become a more dominant sector of the society ... I
think finding a way to help those companies buy U.S. goods and
services would go a long way towards helping the Chinese economy
as well as helping our own.""
 One promising area for U.S. exports is medical devices
because of China's plan to expand hospitals and other health care
facilities in both urban and rural areas, he said.

banking sector.

 Europe's fumbling response to a Greek debt crisis and
bulging deficits in other euro zone countries have unnerved
markets over the past six weeks, and the central bank takeover
of a small Spanish lender at the weekend stoked fears of a
wider meltdown.
 ""This situation with the Spanish bank makes investors
nervous because it raises suspicions that something else may be
smouldering behind the scenes,"" said Hiroichi Nishi, equity
division general manager at Nikko Cordial Securities in Tokyo.
 European stocks looked set to dive, with futures for the

 In South Korea, the benchmark index <.KS11> lost 2.7

 A trader at a European brokerage house in Tokyo said the

 SYDNEY, May 25 (Reuters) - The euro was under pressure on
Tuesday, as a recent short covering bounce faded and concerns
about a broader contagion to the banking sector from the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone drove investors to sell.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro dropped over 1.5
percent and U.S. stocks slid on Monday after Spain's bailout of
a small bank raised concern about Europe's financial system,
boosting safe-haven demand for gold and U.S. Treasuries.
 Stocks had a volatile session, with the Dow and the S&P 500
sinking more than 1 percent in the final trading minutes. In
Europe, however, stocks snapped a three-day losing streak as
rising mining shares offset declines in bank stocks.
 News that Spain's central bank on Saturday had taken over
savings bank CajaSur after a failed merger weighed heavily on
sentiment across financial markets.
 CajaSur will now have access to Spain's bank bailout fund.
Analysts worry other banks could require public funds at a time
when much of Europe is struggling with massive deficits.
 ""The Spanish news is not really a big story, but it does
highlight that there are a lot of cracks in the financial
system,"" said Steven Butler, director of foreign exchange
trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 ""The concern is that if these cracks get bigger, the
question is who would be able to contain it. This is obviously
a warning and we'll see if it becomes more significant,"" he
added.
 Wall Street seesawed during most of the day, with the
Nasdaq rising as much as 0.7 percent during the session. But
fears about Europe's ongoing debt crisis knocked down investors
later on the day.
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 126.82 points,
or 1.24 percent, at 10,066.57 while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index lost 14.04 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,073.65. The
Nasdaq Composite Index slid 15.49 points, or 0.69 percent, to
2,213.55.
 Bank shares pressured the market, with the Standard &
Poor's financial index falling 2.9 percent. Shares of Citigroup
 gained 0.8 percent, however, after Goldman upgraded the
bank.
 European trading was thin due to a religious holiday, but
most markets were open. The FTSEurofirst 300 finished 0.33
percent higher, after sliding as much as 0.7 percent earlier.
 Shares of miners supported European markets higher as the
outlook for metals improved after an Chinese official said the
government should be particularly cautious in introducing new
monetary tightening measures.
 Plans outlined by British Finance Minister George Osborne
and David Laws, Osborne's deputy, on Monday to cut 6.25 billion
pounds ($9 billion) of government spending generally hurt
sentiment, traders said.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI slid 0.7 percent, adding
to last week's 4.8 percent loss.
 But emerging markets stocks rose 0.5 percent, as rising
prices of oil and other raw materials supported the outlook for
commodity-exporting countries.
 U.S. crude oil futures edged up in choppy trading as some
analysts said the market was oversold, but concerns about
Europe curbed a sharp recovery in prices. The oil contract for
July ended up 0.24 percent, at $70.21 a barrel.
 EURO PLUNGES AGAIN
 The euro fell broadly on Monday, as persistent concerns
about the euro-zone debt situation threatened the future of the
single currency.
 The news wiped out last week's short-covering rally in the
euro, which had been spurred by talk European monetary
officials might intervene to prop up the beleaguered single
currency.
 The euro was down 1.67 percent at $1.236. Last week, it
reached a four-year low of $1.2143.
 Data showing U.S. existing home sales rose more than
expected in April briefly pushed the euro to session lows
against the dollar at $1.2345, according to EBS data.
 ""People are piling money into dollars and Treasuries,
hoping they can ride out the storm,"" said John Canally,
economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial in
Boston.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 9/32 in price,
with the yield at 3.2014 percent. Spot gold prices, another
safe-haven, climbed 1.4 percent to $1,191.50.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Monday, stung by a new round of worries that the euro
zone's debt crisis could spread after Spain's central bank took
over a small savings bank.
 The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over
savings bank CajaSur following the failure of its planned
merger with another regional lender. The news caused the euro
to retreat from last week's gains.
 Although CajaSur is relatively small, analysts said the
bailout highlighted weakness in the European banking sector and
fueled worries that other savings banks could require money at
a time when Spain is trying to slash government spending and
repair public finances.
 It is ""a sign that sovereign debt risk is spreading from
the public to the private sector,"" said Dan Cook, a senior
market analyst at IG Markets Inc in Chicago.
 ""This move further highlights the risk to, and weakness in,
the European banking sector. The liquidity issues faced by
financial firms in many areas in Europe by itself would be
enough to slow growth prospects across the region,"" he added.
 In late New York trading, the euro was down 1.5 percent on
the day at $1.2383. It fell 1.1 percent versus the yen to
111.88 yen.
 Traders said the euro's losses accelerated after stop-loss
orders were triggered under $1.2480. European banks and Asian
central banks were also seen selling the euro in quiet trade,
with many European markets closed for a holiday.
 Support is seen around $1.2135, the 50 percent retracement
from the euro's all-time low to its all-time high. Last week,
the euro fell to a four-year low of $1.2143 before recovering.
 ""The Spanish news is not really a big story, but it does
highlight that there are a lot of cracks in the financial
system,"" said Steven Butler, director of foreign exchange
trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""The concern is that if
these cracks get bigger, the question is, 'Who would be able to
contain it?""
 SHORT-COVERING STALLS
 The euro had hit around $1.2670 on Friday. It rallied last
week as investors exited short positions in the single
currency, partly on speculation the euro's dramatic decline in
recent weeks could prompt central banks to intervene to prop up
the currency.
 Commodities Futures Trading Commission data shows IMM
speculators had by early last week cut back slightly on record
bets the single European currency will weaken.
 Those positions have ballooned in past months, pushing the
euro lower against the backdrop of Greece's debt crisis, which
has threatened to spread to Spain and Portugal and raised
concerns about the euro's stability.
 ""The euro is lower against every major currency as last
week's short-covering rally has clearly ceased,"" said Andrew
Busch, global FX strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago.
""It feels like a 1.2200-1.2700 range is what we're going to
experience through the U.S. release"" of nonfarm payrolls data
in early June, he added.
 Data released on Monday that showed U.S. existing home
sales rose more than expected in April briefly pushed the euro
to session lows against the dollar around $1.2345, according to
EBS data.
 Liquidity has dried up, leaving investors scrambling for
safe-haven dollars. This helped to boost the dollar roughly 1.1
percent higher against a currency basket.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 90.36,
while sterling was down 0.2 percent at $1.4433.

 * Also emphasizes need to keep near-term stimulus
 * Lists uncertainty over Europe as a risk to global growth
(Incorporates USA-ECONOMY/SUMMERS and ECONOMY-USA/SUMMERS)
 By Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - The United States faces a
balancing act between assuring global investors it will rein in
its budget deficits and spurring economic growth in the near
term, White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said on
Monday.
 Summers said that putting the economy on a sound fiscal
track was crucial to its long-term health but added that it
would it would ""penny-wise and pound-foolish"" for the
government to back away from its efforts to stimulate the
economy.
 Summers, director of the White House National Economic
Council, pushed proposals supported by President Barack Obama
to extend jobless and health benefits to the unemployed and
help financially struggling U.S. states.
 ""It is not possible to imagine sound budgets in the absence
of economic growth and solid economic performance,"" Summers
said in a speech to the Johns Hopkins University School of
Advanced International Studies.
 ""Equally, assurances that deficits will come down once an
economy recovers are integral to the maintenance of confidence
that is essential for economic recovery,"" he said.
 The worst economic crisis since World War Two has sent U.S.
deficits soaring. The deficit hit $1.4 trillion in 2009, or
nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product. The White House
has projected it will climb even higher this year, to almost
$1.6 trillion.
 Aiming to show he is serious about stemming the deficits,
Obama has named a panel of outside experts charged with
recommending ways to improve the nation's fiscal position.
 The deficit woes of countries like Greece, Portugal and
Spain are seen by some analysts as a warning signal to the
United States to fix its fiscal problems.
 Summers is the latest White House official to stress the
Obama administration's commitment to dealing with the problem.
 White House budget director Peter Orszag earlier this month
said in a Reuters interview that the United States must ""never
wind up facing the sorts of choices that Greece now faces.""
 EUROPE'S WOES
 In his speech, Summers said southern Europe's problems
highlighted the need for pursuing sustainable fiscal policies.
 ""In settings such as those that arise in emerging markets
or have arisen recently in southern Europe where there is doubt
about the ability of government to subsequently raise taxes or
cut expenditures to repay newly incurred debts, increased
budget deficits raise the prospect of inflation or default with
dire consequences for financial markets,"" he said.
 In the United States, Summers said neither reducing the
deficit nor boosting growth can be pursued in isolation.
 Discussing the near-term economic outlook, Summers said
there were ""growing signs of recovery.""
 As one indication of economic improvement, he noted that
forecasters had gone from debating the risk of a double-dip
recession to debating the pace of the recovery.
 Still, Summers said an ""economic emergency grinds on"" for
millions of Americans who have lost their jobs. The U.S.
unemployment rate now stands at 9.9 percent.
 He listed some risks to the economic recovery, including
the persistence of unemployment and the potential impact from
the European debt crisis in U.S. growth. He said that ""recent
events in Europe have introduced uncertainty into the prospects
of global growth.""

857,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2010 03:27PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-IMF chief economist: doubts over Greek aid remain," * Greek past, doubts over aid keep markets ""concerned""
 * Other euro zone members don't need such drastic measures
 * No U.S. contagion but adjustment plan needed - Blanchard
 By John Irish
 PARIS, May 24 (Reuters) - The IMF's chief economist warned
on Monday that markets will remain concerned until doubts over
the European Union delivering on its aid promise to the Greek
government and Greece's debt-payment history are resolved.
 ""The markets are wondering if Greece will be able to repay
its debt or not,"" Olivier Blanchard said in an interview to be
published on Tuesday in La Tribune newspaper. ""Given the
behavior of Greek governments in the past, their uncertainties
are understandable.""
 There are also doubts about the EU's ability to deliver the
money it has promised to finance the Greek government and about
the European Central Bank's policies, Blanchard said.
 EU governments are trying to regain investor confidence
after months of turmoil that have pushed many euro zone states'
borrowing costs sky high and led to a 110 billion euro ($136
billion) bailout of Greece plus a 750 billion euro safety net
to try to prevent contagion.
 Blanchard said Greece must show determination in
implementing the plan agreed with the EU and the International
Monetary Fund, parliaments across the euro zone must agree on
the measures and the ECB must clarify its position and convince
markets it would continue to buy government bonds.
 Germany's parliament approved a law on Friday allowing
Europe's biggest economy to contribute to the emergency debt
package despite broad public opposition.
 A clear majority of lawmakers in the lower house backed the
bill. But in a sign of domestic pressure piling on Chancellor
Angela Merkel, 10 members of her own center-right coalition
voted against it or abstained.
 U.S. ADJUSTMENT PLAN
 While Greece has no alternative but to accept the austerity
measures, Blanchard echoed comments by IMF chief Dominique
Strauss-Kahn that, to avoid dampening growth, big euro zone
countries should not focus too quickly on narrowing budget
deficits.
 ""Other European countries do not need to take such drastic
measures as Greece,"" he said. ""They are more credible to begin
with, have less debt and can afford a more gradual adjustment,
and therefore limit the negative impact ... on growth in the
short term.""
 Barring ""catastrophic events,"" Blanchard said the debt
package from Europe and the IMF would be enough.
 The United States did not have to worry about contagion
but, given its very large deficits, it will also need to
introduce an adjustment plan, albeit more gradually, he said.
 ""The behavior of markets shows that the U.S. Treasury bills
remain the safe haven,"" Blanchard
said.
 ""However, the depreciation of the euro is not good news for
the United States. This will increase pressure on other
countries, especially emerging Asian countries, to revalue
their currencies.""

 * UN should drop plan for Sri Lanka rights panel-minister
 By Patrick Worsnip
 UNITED NATIONS, May 24 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka could still
avoid the withdrawal of European Union trade concessions over
its human rights record following two rounds of talks with
Brussels, the Asian country's foreign minister said on Monday.
 The EU is due to cancel in August a trade preference
amounting to $150 million annually that helps Sri Lanka's top
export, garments, after finding the country failed to adhere to
a number of rights conventions required under the scheme.
 Rights groups have said the Sri Lankan government should be
investigated for potential war crimes at the end of a
quarter-century war against separatist Tamil guerrillas a year
ago. Colombo has denied the allegations and rejected charges
that tens of thousands of civilians died.
 External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris told Reuters in an
interview that a team of Sri Lankan officials had made two
trips to Brussels, the second of them at the end of last week,
to discuss the trade preference and Sri Lanka's rights record.
 ""It's an ongoing discussion,"" he said. ""There's no final
decision and it is still possible that the parties will be able
to agree on a set of measures to be implemented to prevent the
withdrawal of these trade concessions later this year.""
 No date for further talks had been set, but Colombo would
be in touch with the EU, he said. ""If they feel that any
further clarification is necessary ... we would certainly not
be averse to sending a team ... to continue talks.""
 Peiris said EU officials had praised Sri Lanka for relaxing
wartime emergency rules earlier this month and for resettling
in their home areas most of the almost 300,000 people who fled
as the government moved in to crush the Tamil Tiger fighters.
 NEW DEVELOPMENT
 This month, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa named an
eight-person ""commission on lessons learned and reconciliation""
to look into the last seven years of the war, a move welcomed
by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice.
 Peiris said that because the appointment of the commission,
the United Nations should drop a plan announced by
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in March to set up a panel to
advise him on ""accountability issues"" in Sri Lanka. Ban has not
so far named the members of the panel.
 ""The situation has been transformed by this new
development,"" Peiris said, arguing that Sri Lankans would see
the U.N. panel as foreign intervention.
 Ban ""must recognize the current reality of the situation on
the ground in Sri Lanka and not pursue what he had earlier
proposed,"" he added.
 Ban told reporters shortly before he was to meet Peiris he
was ""still working on"" setting up the panel and suggested one
of its tasks would be to assess the Sri Lankan commission.
 ""The group of experts will have to advise me (on) the basic
character and the role of this commission. This is what I have
in my mind,"" the U.N. chief said.
 Peiris dismissed charges that past Sri Lankan commissions
of inquiry had achieved little. ""Of course it has teeth,"" he
said of the new commission, saying its mandate gave it power to
determine whether individuals should be held responsible.
 Peiris said he would travel to Washington on Tuesday to
meet U.S. government officials. He also said he expected U.N.
political chief Lynn Pascoe to visit Sri Lanka in the next two
to three weeks.

(Adds quote from second minister, background)
 By Andras Gergely
 DUBLIN, May 24 (Reuters) - Europe is engaged in a battle
with speculators who aim to break up the euro currency area, a
junior minister in Ireland's Finance Ministry said on Monday,
while noting overtones of a conspiracy in the speculation.
 European Union leaders agreed a roughly $1 trillion safety
net for the euro currency earlier this month to prevent the
debt crisis that began in Greece from spreading to other euro
zone countries with big budget deficits and debt loads, such as
Spain or Ireland.
 Authorities are still experimenting with regulatory and
intervention measures to calm markets, some of which have
backfired as investors see the underlying problems of the
crisis as unresolved.
 ""There is a real battle going on against speculative forces
who want to upend the euro,"" said Martin Mansergh, minister of
state for finance.
 ""There are people there who don't necessarily want the
situation to settle down,"" Mansergh told Today FM radio in
answer to a question about newspaper articles in the past week
on Ireland's debt and banking problems.
 Morgan Kelly, an economics professor at University College
Dublin, in an opinion piece published on Saturday, said
Ireland's banking liabilities could cause its debt problems to
eclipse Greece, despite Dublin's efforts to cut spending in
other areas.
 Government officials have repeatedly denied Kelly's claims,
and many other analysts maintain Ireland's fiscal reforms have
put it in a different league from Greece.
 Eamon Ryan, a senior minister in charge of communications
and energy, acknowledged when speaking separately to reporters
that big mistakes had been made in banking policy and that the
spending cuts were unpopular. But he said the risks were
manageable.
 ""While it's difficult, while it's very tight particularly
on the government budget side, we have still the ability to get
out of it even if there's a difficult economic situation
internationally,"" Ryan said.
 Ministers were also asked about a New York Times blog by a
former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund last
week which also pointed to the burden of Ireland's bank
rescues.
 There are ""commentators from the Anglo-American financial
community who are deeply sceptical of and hostile to the euro
and the whole project,"" Mansergh said.
 Praised by investors for its determination to cut spending,
Ireland still had the biggest budget deficit in the European
Union last year compared with the size of its economy due to
the cost of its bank bailouts.
 The government says it is on track to cut its deficit to be
in line with the European Union's limit of 3 percent of GDP by
2014, from over 14 percent in 2009, and that the Irish economy
does not have the same structural problems as southern European
peers.
 ""Of course if you had lots of separate currencies that
would be more profits for the financial sector,"" Mansergh
said.
 Asked if there was an international conspiracy against
Ireland or the euro, Mansergh said: ""Against the euro there is
that tendency in it.""

 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro slid on Monday,
pulling back from last week's gains, as the Spanish central

debt problems in weaker euro zone economies.
 The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over
CajaSur following the failure of its planned merger with

 The move highlighted weakness in the banking sectors of
some euro zone members already suffering from fiscal problems
and struggling to bring down budget deficits.
 The news wiped out last week's short-covering rally in the

 CajaSur accounts for a little more than 0.5 percent of the
Spanish banking industry. It now has access to Spain's bank
bailout fund. Analysts worry other savings banks could require
money from the fund at a time when Spain is trying to slash
government spending and repair public finances.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro dropped about 1.5
percent on Monday and global stocks seesawed after Spain's
takeover of a savings bank reminded investors of Europe's
ongoing debt problems.
 Gold prices rose more than 1 percent on renewed appetite
for safe-haven assets but emerging market stocks remained in
positive territory, supported by rising oil prices.
 Europe's debt jitters grew as investors returned from the
weekend with news Spain's central bank had taken over savings
bank CajaSur after its planned merger with another of the
country's small lenders failed. [ID:nLDE64L007]
 CajaSur will now have access to Spain's bank bailout fund.
Analysts worry other banks could require public funds at a time
when much of Europe is struggling with massive deficits.
 ""People are going into safety. Things are not going to
change overnight,"" said George Goncalves, head of U.S. interest
rate strategy with Nomura Securities International in New
York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 38.40 points,
or 0.38 percent, to 10,154.99, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> was down 1.37 points, or 0.13 percent, at
1,086.32. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 11.78 points,
or 0.53 percent, to 2,240.82.
 European trading was thin due to a religious holiday, but
most markets were open. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up
0.33 percent, after sliding as much as 0.7 percent earlier.
 Plans outlined by British finance minister George Osborne
and Treasury minister David Laws on Monday to cut 6.25 billion
pounds ($9 billion) of government spending generally hurt
sentiment, traders said.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.2 percent, adding to last week's 4.8 percent loss on worries
about a slowing global economy and stresses in the euro zone.
 But emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> rose 0.7 percent, as
rising prices of oil and other raw materials supported the
outlook for commodity-exporting countries.
 U.S. crude oil futures edged up in choppy trading as some
analysts said the market was oversold, but concerns about
Europe curbed a sharp recovery in prices. The oil contract for
July  was up 0.51 percent, at $70.40 a barrel.
 EURO PLUNGES AGAIN
 The euro fell broadly on Monday, pulling back from last
week's gains, as persistent concerns about the euro-zone debt
situation threatened the future of the single currency.
 The euro  was down 1.54 percent at $1.2376. Last
week, it reached a four-year low of 1.2143.
 Data showing U.S. existing home sales rose more than
expected in April briefly pushed the euro to session lows
against the dollar at $1.2345, according to EBS data.

 ""Despite the modest rebound towards the end of last week,
we expect to see further EUR/USD downside ahead as the euro

said in a note.
 As aversion to risk rose, spot gold prices  climbed
1.06 percent to $1,187.60. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury

 * Emerging mkt debt calendar light relative to develpd mkts
 * Longer maturity in EM; rollover costs lower than before
 
 By Sujata Rao and Sebastian Tong
 LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - A debt refinancing scramble in
the developed world poses only a fleeting risk to emerging
sovereign borrowers, whose longer debt maturity profiles and
light redemption calendars should enable them to weather any
storm.
 Historically large amounts of debt are due to be rolled over
across the world in the coming years as predominantly
short-dated debt issued by U.S. and euro zone governments to
bail out their banks start to fall due.
 With financial markets still fragile, the prospect of having
to roll these vast sums continuously are unnerving global
investors. Even the European Central Bank warned recently the
euro zone's over-reliance on short-term borrowing had boosted
refinancing risks.
 Traditionally, this risk to ""core"" debt markets and the
prospect of rising benchmark borrowing rates would see most
emerging market sovereigns crowded out.
 But many investors reckon the picture looks less scary for
developing countries this time around.
 ""Emerging markets have not been caught this time in the debt
rollover cycle,"" said Pierre-Yves Bareau, who runs $8 billion in
emerging debt at JP Morgan Asset Management.
 ""A lot of euro zone debt is front-loaded but in emerging
markets, they have tried to push forward debt maturity. Plus,
the cost of rolling over debt is lower than it used to be.""
 With the exception of some weak links such as Hungary, the
emerging debt calendar is nothing like that of developed states.
ING Bank estimates their total external debt service needs for
2010 at $75.9 billion -- of which half has already been raised.
 That compares with the 1.3 trillion euros the euro zone must
find over the next year to repay maturing debt or the $1.6
trillion the U.S. Treasury has to redeem this year - a fifth of
all outstanding Treasuries.
 Secondly, the past decade has seen emerging debt maturities
get longer -- the opposite to the process in developed markets
-- and that reduces vulnerability to short-term market turmoil.
 ""Emerging markets is an under-invested asset class so I am
less concerned about the crowding out than the impact of risk
aversion ... (that is) if people start getting more worried
about de-leveraging and the rollover risk in the developed
world,"" Bareau said.
 Because past debt rollover crises were in emerging markets,
these countries made a push to cut down on short-maturity debt.
Even non-investment grade issuers Turkey and Egypt have pushed
their dollar curves out to 30 years, unthinkable a decade ago.
 Today, average maturity for emerging sovereign dollar bonds
listed on JPMorgan's EMBI Plus index is 12 years, down only
slightly from pre-crisis peaks. On local debt, the GBI-EM index
has an average tenor of 5.6 years, JPM data shows.
 U.S. Treasuries' average maturity fell in late 2009 to a
26-year low of just over four years. For euro zone bonds it is
6.5 years.
 
 FOREIGNERS' HOLDINGS
 Deutsche Bank strategist David Duong says the extent of
vulnerability can be more clearly gauged by comparing debt
volumes held by foreigners in emerging markets and the
peripheral euro zone states, the bloc's weak link.
 He calculates major emerging nations must redeem
foreign-held debt worth 2.3 percent of GDP over the next three
years, versus 12 percent of GDP in Portugal, Ireland, Greece and
Spain. In Greece, this is a massive 20 percent of GDP.
 ""Emerging market external rollover needs seem relatively
small compared to peripheral EMU,"" Duong told clients. ""We
believe most emerging market countries are within their limits
to comfortably apply their rollover needs over the next several
years ... although Latin America and Asia rank better in this
regard than EMEA.""
 A key factor has been strong investor appetite. EPFR data
shows emerging bond funds absorbed a record $10 billion in the
first quarter , helping emerging borrowers -- sovereign and
corporate -- to raise almost $100 billion in this period.
 ""Fund flows into dedicated emerging bond funds have been
very high since late last year and this has sustained the
primary bond market,"" said Regis Chatellier, senior emerging
markets strategist at Morgan Stanley. 
 
 HOT SPOTS
 But Chatellier warned: ""If fund flows were to drop very
substantially, we would probably see the direct impact on the
emerging markets primary market""
 Recent steep market sell-offs make that a very real risk.
Emerging Europe was where pressures were highest last year
as the economic downturn, huge funding needs and currency
depreciation put some debt repayments in doubt and forced some
Kazakh and Ukrainian state-run firms to restructure debt.
 Now many countries in the region are backed by the
International Monetary Fund, there has been some growth recovery
and the amounts due for redemption are in most cases, smaller.
 There are a few hot spots. Hungary potentially is one -- 11
percent of its debt held by foreigners comes up for redemption
in the next three years, Deutsche's Duong estimates. Poland, the
Philippines and Turkey too have fairly high amounts of
foreign-held debt to roll over -- 5-7 percent of GDP.
 On local bonds, Turkey's redemptions this year amount to
17.8 percent of GDP while Hungary and Philippines have 11
percent.
 However, analysts say that high foreign exchange reserve
levels mean emerging domestic rollover risks are minimal, at
least in the near term.

 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday, pulling back from gains last week, after the Spanish
central bank's takeover of a savings bank added to jitters
about debt problems in some of the weak euro zone countries.
 The Bank of Spain on Saturday said it had taken over the
running of CajaSur following the failure of its planned merger
with another regional lender.
 The move highlighted the weakness of the banking sectors of
some euro zone members, already suffering from fiscal problems
and struggling to bring down their budget deficits.
 The news also wiped out last week's short-covering rally in
the euro spurred by fears European monetary officials might
intervene to prop up the beleaguered single currency.
 ""We did have news about the Spanish bailout of a bank. But
that's only part of the story,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior
currency strategist, at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""What we saw last week was a short-squeeze rally on the
euro and that was short-lived. Overall, the underlying theme is
still one of risk aversion.""
 In late morning New York trading, the euro was down 1.6
percent on the day at $1.2365. It fell 1.2 percent versus the
yen to 111.81
 Traders said the euro's losses accelerated after stop-loss
orders were triggered under $1.2480. European banks and Asian
central banks were also seen selling the euro in quiet trade,
with many European markets on holiday.
 Last week, the euro fell to a four-year low of $1.2143.
Support is seen around $1.2135, the 50 percent retracement from
the euro's all-time low to its all-time high.
 News U.S. existing home sales rose more than expected in
April briefly pushed the euro to session lows against the
dollar at $1.2345, according to EBS data.
 ""The (housing) data should at the margin work in favor of
quelling a still skittish equity market, but it is going to
need a big data point, like non-farm payroll, to act as a
significant offset to the nervousness instigated from across
the Atlantic,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief currency strategist, at
RBS Global Banking and Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The euro has retreated from $1.2670 hit on Friday. It
rallied last week as investors exited extreme short positions
in the single currency, in part due to fears of intervention to
prop up the euro after its dramatic decline in past weeks.
 Commodities Futures Trading Commission data shows IMM
speculators had by early last week cut back slightly on record
bets the single European currency will weaken.
 Those positions have ballooned in past months, pushing the
euro lower against the backdrop of Greece's debt crisis, which
has threatened to spread to Spain and Portugal and raised
concerns about the euro's stability.
 Liquidity has dried up, leaving investors scrambling for
safe-haven dollars. This helped to boost the dollar roughly 1.2
percent higher against a currency basket to 86.371 on Monday.

873,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2010 10:39AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Turkey's scrap gold sales outweigh imports," * Traders put scrap selling so far this month at 8-10 tonnes
 * See sales taper off as price moderated below $1,200
 * Imports seen picking up if gold price dips further
 By Behiye Selin Taner
 ISTANBUL, May 24 (Reuters) - High global gold prices have
pushed the market past a crucial tipping point in Turkey, the
world's third largest consumer, with more gold coming from
domestic scrap than imports, sector officials and dealers said.
 In the first few weeks of May traders put the volume coming
from scrap sales at between 8-10 tonnes, though they say sales
tailed off once the price moderated to below $1,200 an ounce.
 According to Istanbul Gold Exchange data, gold imports
during the first four months of this year dwindled to 1.17
tonnes, having actually hit zero in March.
 Signs of recovery emerged in April, when imports rose to 800
kg from just 25.7 kg in the same period last year.
 Turkey, a centre for jewellery manufacturing, was badly hit
by the global financial crisis, and as the country lurched into
recession imports of gold slumped to 37.6 tonnes in 2009 from
166 tonnes in 2008.
 The Turkish economy is expected to recover strongly this
year, and dealers see demand reviving if gold prices continue to
slip back.
 As of May 24, the Istanbul Gold Exchange gold price stood at
59.87 Turkish lira ($37.99) per gram, while the world spot price
was $1,183, back from a record $1,248.95 earlier in May.
 ""The gram gold price rose from around 55 lira to around 60
lira and these are high levels at which people want to sell,""
said Garanti Bank gold dealer Alper Kalyoncu, reckoning that
scrap sales totalled 10 tonnes so far in May.
 ""But if the gold price approaches the 55-56 lira ($35-36)
level, then demand and buying could resume. This may result in a
resumption in imports,"" Kalyoncu added.
 Spot dealer Adnan Kapikaya estimated the volume of scrap
gold coming into Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, an unofficial centre
of the Turkish gold trade, at around eight tonnes since the
start of May. He also said scrap selling had halted as prices
fell.
 ""The gold market will become more active towards the end of
the year, both in terms of imports and exports,"" he said.
 
 JEWELLERY EXPORTS SEEN AT $1.2 BLN
 Jewellery exports, which fell to $1 billion last year from
$1.5 billion in 2008, were expected to hit $1.2 billion this
year, said Ismet Kocak, chairman of the Istanbul Precious
Minerals and Jewellery Exporters' Association.
 However, the continued high prices were seen limiting the
volume of exports.
 ""The approaching wedding season will raise gold demand.
However, high gold prices are making buyers wait. Jewellery
buyers are either reducing or delaying their buying,"" Kocak
said.

approved on Tuesday will cut public sector hiring and pay,
temporarily block those set to retire and reduce funding to
local government, according to a draft obtained by Reuters.
 The budget draft says only 20 percent of those who leave the
public sector in 2011 to 2013 will be replaced, and it cuts
transfers to municipal and regional authorities by 2 billion
euros in 2011 and 3.8 billion in 2012.
 Those who would have earned the right to retire in mid-2011
and at the end of 2011, according to the so-called retirement
""windows"", must remain at work for a further six months.
 The budget, which aims to cut the deficit by around 13
billion euros in 2011, also makes cuts in the politically
sensitive area of health spending, trimmed by 0.4 billion euros
next year and 1.1 billion in 2012.
 Spending by government ministries, including pay, is reduced
by 8-10 percent per year in 2011 to 2013.
 Other policies in the draft are a 10 percent cut from 2011
in the pay of government ministers and a 10 percent cut in the
pay of public sector employees earning more than 75,000 euros.
 The austerity package is still being hotly debated within
the government and all the measures could be subject to change
before final approval. The pay cuts for high earners is being
resisted particularly fiercely by some ministers.
 The government aims to cut the budget deficit from 5.3
percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 2.7 percent in
2011.
 The budget launches a crackdown on false claimants for
invalidity benefits, announcing 100,000 checks per year in
2010-2012.
 Among the victims of Italy's austerity plans is publicly
funded think-tank ISAE, which conducts closely-watched surveys
on Italian consumer and business confidence.
 In future the functions carried out by ISAE will pass
directly to the economy ministry, the draft says.

 * Common market on schedule
 
 By George Obulutsa
 NAIROBI, May 24 (Reuters) - East African Community, a
five-nation trade bloc that aims to have a monetary union in
2012, said on Monday that problems in the euro area will serve
as a lesson but will not discourage its move to a single
currency.
 East African Community (EAC) comprises Uganda, Kenya,
Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi. It already has a customs union,
and a common market is due to take effect in July. After the
monetary union, it eventually aims to have a political
federation.
 Juma Mwapachu, EAC's secretary general, said the bloc was
watching events in the European union, hoping to learn from the
Greek debt experience, and avoid similar pitfalls.
 ""The lesson for us is not that we should slow down our
movement towards the monetary union, but really to ensure that
we do not find any of our member states, falling into the kind
of experience that Greece has gone into,"" Mwapachu told Reuters.
 The Greek debt crisis has sparked huge instability in the
11-year-old euro currency and led to demands for EU states to
work much harder on coordinating their economic policies to
bring their finances into check.
 ""I think the EAC region has got to be concerned that the
euro area is going through this kind of turbulence. But then it
really goes down to point out how critical it is that you do
have effective macroeconomic convergence,"" Mwapachu said.
 EAC has a gross domestic product of $73.3 billion and a
population of close to 127 million.
 Speaking earlier at a news conference during the launch of a
World Bank report on doing business in the EAC, Mwapachu said
the common market would start on schedule, but said some laws,
like those on labour and movement of capital, had to be reformed
to smooth the process.
 ""We are going to begin the process from July 1. It will
demand quite a bit of reforms at national levels and maybe even
at the EAC level,"" he said.

International Monetary Fund report, which a group of U.S.
senators says shows that Beijing manipulates the value if its
currency, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Monday.
 The group of about 10 U.S. senators is led by Charles
Schumer, a New York Democrat and Lindsey Graham, a South
Carolina Republican. They have said U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner should demand that China release the report
during this week's economic summit in Beijing.
 Asked by a journalist about the report, Zhou suggested it
didn't exist.
 ""We don't know of such a report by the International
Monetary Fund,"" Zhou said. ""There's no such report.""
 The U.S. lawmakers claimed that China had suppressed
publication of a staff report prepared during the IMF's annual
consultation with China last summer. It is left up to the
country that is being consulted to decide whether to issue
staff reports prepared during the process.
 The Chinese currency has been pegged to the U.S. dollar
since the summer of 2008, although it is officially permitted
to move narrowly against a basket of currencies.
 Geithner and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are
leading the U.S. delegation at the annual Strategic and
Economic Dialogue that began on Monday.
 Geithner said he welcomed Beijing's recognition that
exchange rate reform should be part of China's broader reform
agenda.
 Schumer, a regular critic of China's pegged currency rate,
has said the IMF staff report ""could be the smoking gun that
confirms that China has been intentionally manipulating its
currency"" for an unfair trade advantage.

world's top producer of nickel and palladium, said in an
interview the company could sell the 51.3 percent stake aiming
to tighten control at home and streamline its overseas
operations.
 ""Stillwater was bought with the expectation that it would
bring strong synergies,"" he said in an interview with the
Financial Times published on Monday.
 ""There were a lot of nuances in the sales agreement that
limited us to being a portfolio investor. Therefore, we are
dependent on how effective the management of Stillwater is. Last
year they worked badly. This year the situation is better, but
not as we would want,"" he said in the interview.
 Norilsk shares were down 5 percent in Moscow at 1145 GMT,
but analysts said the decline could have been linked to the
closure of Norilsk's register ahead of an annual general
meeting, rather than a report.
 ""Norilsk's shares are falling locally because of the
ex-dividend,"" said Barry Ehrlich of Alfa Bank.
 ""Definitely, the decline is linked to the closure of the
registrar,"" Mikhail Stiskin of Troika Dialog confirmed.
Moscow's Micex index was down 1.88 percent.
 Norilsk, which has posted a net profit of $2.65 billion for
2009 has yet to announce its dividend for the period.
 Norilsk's stake in Stillwater is worth about $750 million,
compared with the $341 million in cash and palladium it paid
when the stake was acquired in 2003. But Stillwater is reporting
losses, notching up a loss of 7 cents per share in the fourth
quarter of last year, the FT report said.
 Strzhalkovsky said Norilsk would hold talks with the
Stillwater management.
 In April, Norilsk said in a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission it was exploring an option of selling
all the stake then worth $750 million or part of it. An analyst
said the a diversified miner would be a more likely buyer than a
more specialist platinum or palladium producer.
 Strzhalkovsky said in the interview Norilsk was also
reviewing a possible sale of some underperforming nickel assets
in Australia, which have been idle for a year.
 ""We need to understand how effective these investments are,""
he said.
 Strzhalkovsky said at an investor day in London last week
that it was possible the company would keep its sulphides
operations and sell off its laterites.

 LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply across the
board on Monday, pulling back from a short-covering rally, after
the Spanish central bank's takeover of a savings bank underlined
structural problems facing fiscally fragile euro zone states.
 The Bank of Spain said on Saturday it had taken over the
running of CajaSur following the failure of its planned merger
with another regional lender. [ID:nLDE64L007]
 The move highlighted the weakness of the banking sectors of
some euro zone members, which are already suffering from fiscal
problems and struggling to bring down their budget deficits.
 Spain's largest workers union said on Monday the country was
heading for a general strike in protest at the government's
austerity measures, although it preferred not to call one.
[ID:nMDT009049]
 ""Essentially the Bank of Spain news was an excuse for more
selling, and the longer-term picture in euro/dollar is lower,""
said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
 ""There are wider concerns that a debt problem can't be
solved with more debt and about the effects of austerity
measures on growth,"" he added.
 By 1110 GMT, the euro  was down 1.4 percent on the day
at $1.2394. It fell 1.3 percent versus the yen .
 Traders said euro losses accelerated after stop-loss orders
were triggered under $1.2480. European banks and Asian central
banks were also seen selling the euro in quiet trade, with many
European markets on holiday.
 Last week, the euro fell to a four-year low of $1.2143.
Support is seen around $1.2135, the 50 percent retracement from
the euro's all-time low to its all-time high.
 A U.S. official said on Sunday Europe's debt crisis should
have minimal impact on global growth, but China was more
pessimistic, warning on Monday it would hit demand for its

 European leaders agreed on May 10 on a $1 trillion package
to contain the spread of a debt crisis in Greece.
 
 MORE EURO LOSSES
 The euro has retreated from $1.2670 hit on Friday. It
rallied last week as investors exited extreme short positions in
the single currency, in part due to fears of intervention to
prop up the euro after its dramatic decline in past weeks.
""The euro's short squeeze isn't sustainable,"" said Chris
Turner, head of currency strategy at ING. ""The market is waiting
for the next negative news from the euro zone to sell the euro.""

number was to (grow), we could see renewed pressure on the
euro,"" said Elsa Lignos, currency strategist at RBC.

885,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2010 07:03AM ET</span>",Africa should eye tax hikes on resource firms-study," * Contract reviews unlikely to scare off investors-study
 * Chinese presence is chance to improve returns
 * African countries should widen tax base
 
 By Mark John
 DAKAR, May 24 (Reuters) - African states should consider
renegotiating unfavourable contracts with multinationals to
ensure they get a fair return on their natural resources, a
joint OECD/African Development Bank study urged on Monday.
 The growing presence of companies from China and other
emerging countries on the continent also gives governments the
chance to reap higher rewards from mineral, energy and other
resources by putting them to competitive bidding, it said.
 ""Where multinational firms fail to abide by minimal
corporate governance standards in terms of tax contributions,
governments should consider renegotiating concessions,"" the
report to the Bank's annual meeting argued.
 ""African states are entitled to receive a fair deal for the
exploitation of their natural resources,"" it concluded.
 The proposal was one of several made in a joint paper by the
bank and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development aimed at gradually weaning the continent off
foreign aid by boosting tax and other domestic revenues.
 The lack of transparency surrounding many resource contracts
in Africa and the fact that many of its governments have little
experience in negotiating production agreements and tax regimes
mean their terms vary wildly.
 The report said some African governments were often hesitant
to revisit unfavourable contracts and tax arrangements for fear
of scaring off investors, but said that was unlikely to happen.
 ""Multinational enterprises may threaten to leave but they
are unlikely to actually abandon the exploitation of mines
because of a reasonable rise in taxes or royalties,"" it said.
 
 TARGET THE RICH
 To the alarm of some potential investors, several
mineral-rich countries have already made it clear they want to
see more revenues from their resource sectors.
 Following a sector-wide review of contracts in its lucrative
mining sector, Democratic Republic of Congo has demanded changes
to U.S.-listed Freeport-McMoRan's  agreement for its
Tenke Fungurume copper and cobalt mine.
 Guinea's current government argues Russian aluminium company
UC RUSAL <0486.HK> underpaid for its Friguia alumina refinery in
2006 and is seeking $860 million in what it says are unpaid
taxes, a claim RUSAL disputes.
 Ghana, Africa's second largest gold producer, has said it
wants to double mining royalties, and Sierra Leone hiked
royalties in the mining sector late in 2009.
 For new contracts, the report called on African governments
to take advantage of the growing demand for their resources by
emerging economies to get the best deal possible.
 ""Increased interest in Africa's minerals from Chinese
corporations and other new partners is an opportunity for
governments to reap the fiscal rewards of competitive bidding.
African states must use this opportunity to generate higher
public resources,"" it said.
 While urging governments to improve taxation of their
extractive industries, the report called on them to widen and
diversify the typically narrow tax bases across the continent.
 While Equatorial Guinea was able in 2008 to collect $4,865
per capita in tax -- largely in oil proceeds -- others such as
Burundi, Congo, Ethiopia and Guinea-Bissau have an annual tax
take per head as low as $11, it calculated.
 Options included targeting wealthier Africans with specific
levies such as urban property taxes, road tolls or luxury good
taxes, it argued, acknowledging many such moves would likely be
opposed by influential elites.

 BEIJING, May 24 (Reuters) - Chinese officials moved to reassure their American counterparts
on ""indigenous innovation"" policies, saying their concerns had been taken into account in its
latest draft, while also pressing for a relaxation of American export controls.
 U.S. officials, in Beijing for the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, have pushed hard against
the indigenous innovation policy, which they said would disadvantage foreign suppliers in one of
the world's fastest growing markets.
 China for its part has pushed the U.S. to relax restrictions on certain high-technology
exports, and the two contending points have become the most public aspect of negotiations during
the summit [ID:nTOE64K048].
 Draft ""indigenous innovation"" government procurement rules have been modified to address
concerns raised by foreign companies, and the revisions ""basically resolve"" their concerns over
intellectual property protection and other issues, vice minister of science Cao Jianlin told
reporters on Monday.
 ""We think that the different companies have agreed that the (latest) draft is
non-discriminatory, market-oriented and also reflects the principle of IPR protection,"" said Cao
Jianlin, a vice minister at the Ministry of Science and Technology.
 The concerns raised by foreign companies ""have shifted from the major principles of the
circular to the technical details of the application procedures,"" Cao said.
 ""We are looking closely at the comments we have collected so far and are working on the
improvement and the modification of the wording.""

 Beijing said it welcomes signs that Washington may relax controls on high-tech exports to
China, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming told a news conference on Monday, adding that
relaxing the controls would help balance the bilateral trade.
 Chen said he hoped the reforms would be real and not ""lots of thunder with no rain.""
 China's indigenous innovation programme was subject to misunderstanding abroad, Chen said,
adding that the related government procurement list rules were issued for consultation and were
not in force yet.
 Cao said the Science Ministry had proposed regular meetings with the United States on
technology innovation issues, adding the ministry was working to address concerns expressed by
foreign leaders and business groups.
 Foreign businesses ""believe that China is making progress"", Chen said, citing continued FDI
growth.
 Intellectual property rights have come up in the talks and China takes protecting the issue
very seriously, he added, in a direct acknowledgement of some concerns of foreign investors.
The Chinese side also raised concerns about the ""transparency and predictability"" of U.S.
foreign investment security laws, Chen said.

 LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Monday,
pulling back from a short-covering rally after the Spanish
central bank's takeover of a savings bank underlined structural

 Analysts said short covering in the euro had petered out as
investors remained negative on the currency, and that it was
vulnerable to selling on any hint of weakness in the euro zone.
""The euro's short squeeze isn't sustainable,"" said Chris
Turner, head of currency strategy at ING. ""The market is waiting

 The euro fell around 1.3 percent on the day to as low as

 By Paul de Bendern and Krittivas Mukherjee
 NEW DELHI, May 24 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh said on Monday he failed to do enough in his
first year, but defended himself against criticisms of weak
leadership and said progress would soon be made on concerns
like high inflation.
 Inflation would moderate to around 5 to 6 percent in
December, he said. Inflation is running at nearly 10 percent
and is a major worry for the government as it has raised prices
of basic foods and increased the chance of interest rate hikes.
 Singh, who is 77 and underwent heart surgery last year,
spent much of a rare 90 minute news conference fending off
questions over his leadership after a series of crises ate into
his parliamentary majority and stalled many reform bills.
 Often seen as the ""reluctant"" prime minister appointed by
Congress party head Sonia Gandhi in 2004, Singh said he was not
thinking of retirement. But he hinted he could eventually make
way for family scion Rahul Gandhi.
 Despite being freed from the shackles of needing communist
support in the second term, his government has floundered on
inflation, struggled against a Maoist insurgency, and managed
its political allies so badly its substantial parliamentary
majority dwindled.
 ""I would be the first person to admit that we could have
done more,"" Singh said in a statement given during a rare news
conference in New Delhi to mark the first year since the
Congress-led coalition government was reelected to a second
term.
 ""The work is incomplete right now,"" Singh said later at the
news conference, and with that the case ""there is no question
of retirement.""
 Singh has disappointed many investors with a slow pace of
reforms that investors say are needed to ensure India can
sustain fast economic growth and compete with the likes of
China.
 The press conference was one of only a handful he has given
since first coming to power in 2004. It appeared an attempt to
show he was pushing policies rather than reacting to problems
ranging from the global credit crunch to a cricket corruption
scandal.
 Singh touched upon issues varying from economic growth to
Pakistan diplomacy and the question of his succession.
 But he gave nothing new away, in line with his image of a
reticent politician who is uncomfortable both with 21st century
PR techniques and calls for faster action on policies.
 ""I sometimes feel younger people should take over ... I
would be very happy to make place for anybody the Congress
party chooses,"" he said, responding to a question on whether he
was willing to make way for Rahul Gandhi.
 ""Rahul is very qualified to hold a Cabinet post,"" Singh
said. The prime minister added he had asked Gandhi several
times to join the government cabinet, but he had so far
refused.
 The share and bond markets showed little reaction to the
conference and the benchmark 10-year bond yield was unchanged
at 7.42 percent
 TRYING TO SET AGENDA?
 Outlining government policy, Singh said India was willing
to discuss all ""outstanding issues"" with nuclear foe Pakistan,
implicitly suggesting the government would talk to Islamabad
about the dispute over Kashmir critical to the countries'
relations.
 It was another sign of New Delhi softening its approach to
Islamabad after the 2008 Mumbai attacks when Pakistan-based
militants killed 166 people.
 ""India cannot realise its full development potential unless
we have the best possible relations with our neighbours, and
Pakistan happens to be the largest neighbour of ours,"" he said.
""The trust gap is biggest problem.""
 Singh said he had been assured India would get access to
David Headley, a Chicago man who pleaded guilty of working with
the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba to plan the strike. New
Delhi says it could get more information on militant networks
targeting India if it was allowed to interrogate Headley.
 Singh said he hoped political parties would pass a delayed
nuclear liability bill needed to allow entry of U.S. atomic
energy firms into India.
 He said the central government along with state governments
would take more steps to battle inflation, and that he sees
growth in 2010/11 rising to 8.5 percent.
 Despite investor criticism, the government has won praise
for a sound fiscal policy that has helped protect India from
the worst of the global credit crisis. Growth is one of the
fastest in the world and there have been some tentative steps
to reforms.
 Many investors remain optimistic India eventually will take
steps to open the insurance, banking and retail sectors to
overseas players, and India still attracts many foreign firms.

 LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday,
pulling back from a short-covering rally after the takeover of a
Spanish savings bank by the country's central bank punctured
investor hopes the region's structural problems might be easing.
 The euro was on the back foot after the Bank of Spain on
Saturday said it had taken over the running of CajaSur following
the failure of its planned merger with another of the country's
regional lenders failed.
 Analysts said the move highlighted the weakness of the
banking sectors in some euro zone nations, which are already
suffering from fiscal problems are struggling to bring down
their budget deficits.
 Signs of more cracks in Spain's banking sector might crank
up negative sentiment for the euro and push it lower, they said.
 ""One bank bailout in Spain is not a problem, but if that
number was to (grow), we could see renewed pressure on the
euro,"" said Elsa Lignos, currency strategist at RBC.
 By 0737 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.6 percent on the day to
around $1.2500, after sliding as low as $1.2482. Trade was
fairly quiet, with many European markets on holiday.
 It pulled away from $1.2670 hit on Friday, as fears of
currency intervention prompted investors to exit extreme short
positions in the single currency last week.
 Latest IMM data shows speculators had cut back on record
bets that the single European currency will weaken by early last
week.
 Those positions have ballooned in past months, pushing the
euro as low as $1.2143 early last week against the backdrop of
Greece's debt crisis, which has threatened to spread to Spain
and Portugal and has raised concerns about the stability of the
euro.
 The euro has recovered from that trough as intense risk
aversion has made investors nervous about holding excessive
positions both in favour of or against the currency, but
analysts see more losses down the line.
""We expect to see further EUR/USD downside ahead as the euro
zone fiscal deficit, public debt, and structural issues remain
unresolved despite recent policy initiatives,"" UBS analysts said
in a note.
 
 AUSSIE RECOVERS
 European shares rose roughly 1 percent in early trade,
helping to support higher-risk currencies including the
Australian dollar, which tumbled last week as risk aversion
prompted investors to cut hefty long positions.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent against its U.S.
counterpart to $0.8333, pulling further away from $0.8085 hit
late last week, its weakest since July 2009.
 Against the euro it climbed to the day's high of A$1.4976
according to Reuters data, pulling back from a 3 1/2-month low
hit on Friday, while inching up 0.3 percent against the
low-yielding yen, which is often considered a safe-haven bet.
 Despite gains in some higher-risk currencies on Monday,
investors continued to show demand for dollars as liquidity has
dried up as a result of risk aversion. Against a currency basket
the U.S. currency rose 0.3 percent to 85.649.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - World stocks failed to hang on to
early gains on Monday, falling as Wall Street looked set for
losses, and the euro took another hit, dropping more than 1
percent against the dollar.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
0.3 percent, adding to last week's 4.8 percent loss on worries
about a slowing global economy and stresses in the euro zone.
 Emerging markets stocks <.MSCIEF> were up 0.4 percent, but
well off their daily highs. They lost 7.6 percent last week.
 European trading was thin due to a religious holiday, but
most markets were open. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> turned
down as Wall Street futures pointed to losses at the open. It
was down 0.5 percent.
 ""There's a general risk aversion and there has generally
been a move to liquidate positions,"" Martin Fraenkel, Credit
Agricole's global head of comnmodities and energy, told a
Reuters summit in London.
 Equity markets have been battered recently, first by a fear
that some European countries, notably Greece, were heading for a
default on their sovereign debt and then due to doubts about the
impact of a debt rescue package on growth prospects.
 Jun Kato, senior manager for investment at Shinkin Asset
Management, said while the euro zone's fiscal trouble was still
in focus, ""wariness about its impact on the global economy seems
to be spreading"".
 Year-to-date, all major broad stock indexes are in the red,
although U.S. equities are generally outperforming. This is a
reaction both to a flight from Europe and growing signs of U.S.
economic recovery.
 EURO SLIPPAGE
 The euro tumbled 1.6 percent to $1.2374 , reversing a
late rally on Friday.
 It hit a four-year low of $1.2143 hit last week, but then
recovered somewhat.
 ""Despite the modest rebound towards the end of last week, we
expect to see further EUR/USD downside ahead as the euro zone
fiscal deficit, public debt, and structural issues remain
unresolved despite recent policy initiatives,"" UBS analysts said
in a note.
 Euro zone government bonds yields slipped. The two-year
Schatz yield  was down 2 basis points at 0.466
percent.
 Oil reversed early gains and was down slightly at $69.97 a

 * Japan yet to regain self-sustaining strength - Kan
(Adds Naoshima comments)
 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, May 24 (Reuters) - Japan's economy is picking up
steadily but Europe's debt crisis, wild swings in financial
markets and deflation pose risks to its outlook, the government
said on Monday.
 Finance and Economics Minister Naoto Kan said that while the
direct impact of Europe's debt problems on Japan's economy was
limited, he was closely watching the situation in the region.
 In its monthly report for May, the government kept its
assessment of the economy unchanged for the third straight month
as capital expenditure bottoms out on increases in exports and
output.
 But it added a phrase to the May report warning about Europe
and financial markets, as the region's debt crisis sparked fears
of sovereign risk and caused global stock markets to tumble.
 ""Attention should be paid to potential risks to Japan's
economy such as a possible slowdown in overseas economies,
particularly in Europe, fluctuations in financial markets and the
influence of deflation,"" the report said.
 Japan's economy grew 1.2 percent in the first quarter, the
biggest expansion in three quarters, on robust exports to Asia,
although analysts expect growth to slow as consumption begins to
lose support from government stimulus measures.
 ""The recovery has been largely driven by external demand and
economic stimulus measures. I can't say that the economy is on
track for a self-sustaining recovery yet,"" Kan told reporters
after a meeting of ministers to approve the report.
 The government's assessment of the economy roughly matches
that of the Bank of Japan, which upgraded its view to say last
week that the economy is starting to recovery moderately.
 The euro skidded to an 8 1/2-year trough versus the yen last
week as the euro zone's 750 billion euro ($942.8 billion) safety
net for the debt obligations of its members has failed to ease
concerns about weak public finances.
 The yen also rose against the dollar, prompting a warning by
Japan's finance minister on Friday that excessive currency moves
were undesirable. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters by making
their goods less competitive overseas.
 Trade Minister Masayuki Naoshima also warned on Monday that
weakness in euro-zone economies may affect Japan's recovery if
its key export destinations in emerging Asia take a hit.
 ""Japan is vulnerable to currency risks and therefore we need
to closely watch such risks,"" Naoshima said, according to a
government official present at the meeting.
 The government stuck to the view that Japan is in mild
deflation and repeated its call for the central bank to support
the economy through appropriate and flexible policy.
 Since the government first declared in November that Japan
was in mild deflation, the BOJ has eased policy twice and said it
will not tolerate zero inflation.
 The BOJ kept monetary policy unchanged in a meeting that
ended on Friday but outlined a new loan scheme targeting growth
industries, which it described as a long-term approach to beating
deflation.

901,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2010 03:03AM ET</span>",Concern over China protectionism at 10 yr high -U.S. Chamber," SHANGHAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Concern among U.S. companies
that China is backtracking on opening its economy are at a
10-year high, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said on
Monday.
Chamber President and Chief Executive Thomas Donohue said
companies from the United States were growing increasingly
worried about investing in China because of uncertainty over
future industrial policy measures.
 ""This concern is, are we going to have a level playing field?
What they (U.S. companies) are troubled and what we are therefore
talking about are the industrial and indigenous innovation
policies,"" Donohue said in a speech in Shanghai.
 Donohue said the argument that China was a developing country
and therefore entitled to certain policies that developed
countries were not, did not always hold true.
 ""We advise the Chinese leadership that our companies are
concerned about continuing investment operating restrictions.""
 Earlier in May, Donohue gave a more vocal speech in
Washington, where he said China was using industrial policies to
foster national champions by promoting the transfer of technology
and innovative capacity domestically.
 During his speech in Shanghai, Donohue's rhetoric expressed
concern over China's indigenous policies but said the mainland
had been making great progress compared with many other
countries.
 ""Most critical in Washington and Beijing is not to waver on
the commitment to open markets and the need to move forward all
the time on building this relationship,"" Donohue said.
 Both countries are meeting in Beijing for high-level talks
this week in an attempt to ease Sino-U.S. tensions, which have
escalated in recent months. The U.S. delegation is led by
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hilary
Clinton.
 Donohue said both countries needed to work together to
address global problems including North Korea, adding that he
hoped China could play a very helpful role in addressing the
issue.
 Donohue briefly touched upon the yuan, another contentious
issue in Washington, saying the currency issue was very important
from a political point of view in the United States.
 ""It gives everybody an excuse to be China bashers. I am
hopeful that we will get some rational discussion on this.""

 * Economic impact on Japan limited so far,but govt still wary
 * Govt repeats pledge to work with BOJ to end deflation
 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, May 24 (Reuters) - Japan's economy is picking up
steadily but Europe's debt crisis, wild swings in financial
markets and deflation pose risks to its outlook, the government
said on Monday.
 In its monthly report for May, the government kept its
assessment of the economy unchanged for the third straight month
as capital expenditure bottoms out on increases in exports and
output.
 But it added a phrase to the May report warning about Europe
and financial markets, as the region's debt crisis sparked fears
of sovereign risk and caused global stock markets to tumble.
 ""Attention should be paid to potential risks to Japan's
economy such as a possible slowdown in overseas economies,
particularly in Europe, fluctuations in financial markets and the
influence of deflation,"" the report said.
 Japan's economy grew 1.2 percent in the first quarter, the
biggest expansion in three quarters, on robust exports to Asia,
although analysts expect growth to slow as consumption begins to
lose support from government stimulus measures.
 The government's assessment of the economy roughly traces
that of the Bank of Japan, which said last week that the economy
is starting to recovery moderately.
 The euro skidded to an 8 1/2-year trough versus the yen last
week as the euro zone's 750 billion euro ($942.8 billion) safety
net for the debt obligations of its members has failed to ease
concerns about weak public finances.
 The yen also rose against the dollar, prompting a warning by
Japan's finance minister on Friday that excessive currency moves
were undesirable. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters by making
their goods less competitive overseas.
 The government stuck to the view that Japan is in mild
deflation and repeated its call for the central bank to support

 * Aussie on the defensive, stops above $0.8365
 * Aussie trims losses after fall on Rio Tinto comments
 * Euro/Aussie pair higher as carry trades unwound
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday as
investors sold into its latest bounce, while the Australian
dollar dropped as unwinding of carry trades funded in the single
currency continued on concerns markets would remain volatile.
 After last week's flare-up, when the euro hit a four-year
low, investors were still cutting risk in their portfolios as
they waited for markets to calm down and the Australian dollar
shed 0.5 percent against the dollar and the low-yielding yen.
 The Aussie's losses also deepened after miner Rio Tinto said
a mining tax had damaged Australia's investment reputation, but
it came back off the lows as stocks in China, with which
Australia has close trade ties, rose 3 percent.
 Even though the Aussie is seen as having scope to rebound
possibly above $0.8400, it remains vulnerable, with Aussie/dollar
1-mth risk reversals showing an extreme bias for puts in the
options market.
 The euro too remains vulnerable, as its short-covering bounce
runs out of steam, and one trader said there was talk that hedge
funds were still selling into its rallies against the dollar.
 ""The currency market focus is still the euro zone's fiscal
trouble, but wariness about its impact on the global economy
seems to be spreading, making investors increasingly risk
averse,"" said Jun Kato, senior manager for investment at Shinkin
Asset Management.
 The euro fell to $1.2500 in Asian trade, down 0.6 percent
from late New York business on Friday.
 Last week it hit a four-year low of $1.2143 and then snapped
back to post its first weekly gain against the dollar in six
weeks. But worries about the health of Europe's banking sector
were expected to check further gains, with resistance pencilled
in at Friday's high of about $1.2670.
 At the weekend, the Bank of Spain said it was taking over the
running of Spanish savings bank CajaSur after its planned merger
with another lender failed.
 That weighed on the euro, already hurt by worries about the
impact of deep public spending cuts in Greece, Spain and
Portugal.
 It slipped to 112.72 yen, down 0.3 percent from New York on
Friday when it jumped more than 1.0 percent.
 EURO VS AUSSIE
 Speculators trimmed some of the record high short positions
against the euro in the week ended May 18.. Still, traders said
the euro was likely to struggle in the short term.
 ""The euro is still vulnerable structurally as the short
covering that we saw last week seems to have run its course,""
said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank. ""Also
the unwinding of carry trades that lifted the euro against the
Aussie last week could run into some resistance.""
 The euro rebounded sharply against the high-yielding Aussie
last week, hitting a three-month high around A$1.5456 on the back
of a huge sell-off by hedge funds. On Monday, the pair was
trading at A$1.5100, not far from that peak.
 Charts indicate the euro/Aussie pair put in a weekly key
reversal last week and if it closes above A$1.4777 this month, it
will put the pair in line for a monthly key reversal. That would
not bode well for the Australian dollar.
 The Aussie fell 0.5 percent to $0.8281, with traders
reporting sizable buy stops above $0.8365. Those stops are
expected to be taken out this week, which could push the Aussie
to $0.8425 before it turns down once again.
 Positioning in the options market also points to more pain
for the currency. Markets now favour Aussie/dollar puts by over 5
percent, partly reflecting a growing need among investors to
hedge against further declines.
 The dollar index rose 0.4 percent to 85.71, helped mainly by
the greenback's rise against the euro and the yen. The dollar
inched up 0.1 percent to 90.17 yen.

* Comments help drive down Australian dollar
* Prime Minister Kevin Rudd defends tax
* One opinion poll shows public support for tax
(Adds PM, analysts' quotes; updates shares; adds poll)
 By James Regan
 SYDNEY, May 24 (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto said it
is reviewing all investments in Australia due to a proposed new
tax, describing the country as its No.1 sovereign risk concern
and sending a weak Australian dollar even lower.
 Australia, which accounts for the bulk of Rio's revenue
from iron ore, coal and other commodities, had been considered
a top safe-haven investment destination for miners hunting the
raw materials to fuel Asia's growth.
 But plans by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to introduce a 40
percent tax on miners' so-called super profits has sparked
high-stakes political battle ahead of a general election later
this year.
 ""This is my number one sovereign risk issue on a global
basis,"" Chief Executive Tom Albanese told reporters on Monday,
noting that the tax had set up the prospect of a long period of
uncertainty which was corrosive to new investment.
 Albanese's remarks were seen as adding pressure on Canberra
to scrap or alter the plan as government representatives enter
a second week of industry consultations. Separate meetings late
last week with Rio and BHP Billiton yielded no modifications.
 Rio Tinto's most immediate investment plans will require
about $10 billion to increase iron ore production by 50 million
tonnes in the Pilbara region of the state of Western
Australian.
 ""The issue is the potential magnitude of the change this
tax will bring about and that has heightened concerns of
sovereign risk here in Australia,"" said Wilson HTM analyst John
Young.
 Albanese's comments helped drive the Australian currency
down against the greenback and the yen by more than 1 percent,
on mounting concerns that Rio, BHP, Fortescue Metals Group and
other miners could deliver on their threats to pull billions of
dollars of investments.
 TAXING BATTLE
 Rudd unveiled the tax this month, arguing the government
was not receiving its fair share of the resources boom, which
helped the economy avoid recession during the global financial
crisis.
 ""There will be many many many statements, by many, many
companies, all of whom may have this in common. They don't want
to pay more tax,"" Rudd said in parliament on Monday.
 ""This government believes the time has come for tax reform,
which delivers a fair return for all Australians.""
 Rudd's treasurer, Wayne Swan, in a television interview on
Sunday said Australians were being ""short-changed"" by the
miners under the existing tax regime.
 An online opinion indicated tentative public support for
the mining tax. The Essential Media poll found 43 percent of
1,044 respondents supported the tax and 36 percent were
opposed.
 ""Sovereign risk is typically assessed through surveys of
mining executives such as Tom Albanese, so you may see this
reflected in Australia becoming higher risk,"" said Stephen
Bartrop, portfolio manager for LimeStreet Capital Australian
Resources' Hi-Alpha Fund.
 Albanese said he was bracing for a ""worst-case"" scenario if
the tax is introduced as planned in 2012.
 ""We'd be asking our managers to evaluate it on a worst-case
basis,"" he said, adding that capital would shift in the
meantime to other exploration hot-spots such as Canada.
 Rio Tinto is conducting exploration work in 30 countries,
including Guinea, Madagascar, parts of South America and North
America, Russia and Mongolia as well as Australia for
everything from copper, diamonds and gold to bauxite, iron ore
and coal. ""The proposed resources super profit tax has in
a short time created a significant amount of angst for all
Australians,"" Simon Bennison, chief executive of the
Association of Mining and Exploration Companies in Australia
said.
 Daniel Manley, a stocks dealer at broker Burrell & Co, said
the mining tax was undermining market sentiment.
 ""That sort of sovereign risk that is now associated with
Australia is weighing heavily,"" said Manley.
 Shares in Rio rallied along with the rest of the Australian
stock market, rising 3.5 percent.
 ELECTION CENTREPIECE
 Rudd has put the tax at the centre of his campaign to win
re-election at polls expected around October. It is the
cornerstone of his promise to return the fiscal budget to
surplus by 2012-13, to cut the company tax rate and to
indirectly fund another pledge to raise national retirement
incomes.
 Rudd's Labor Party has seen its popularity plunge, with the
mining scheme failing to win over voters after back-downs on
some troubled policies including curbing carbon emissions and a
scheme to deliver free insulation to Australian homes.
 But his tax won the support of the head of the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Angel Gurria,
who said on Australian radio on the weekend the 40 percent tax
on mining companies is justified.
 Albanese dismissed government claims that Australia held
limited resources for mining and that now was the time for the
country to reap as much revenue as it could from the sector.
""I've heard arguments over the past two weeks that say the
resources are ultimately finite in Australia and there needs to
be as much of a slice of that pie grabbed as possible while you
can. I don't think this is true,"" he said.

talks that got under way in Beijing on Monday is to promote strong, sustainable global growth.
 Wang, who spoke at the Great Hall of the People at the start of the two-day Strategic and
Economic Dialogue (S&ED), added that the two countries' economic ties have enjoyed dynamic growth
and were a major cornerstone of the overall relationship.
 ""With increasingly close links, our two economies have become inseparable. This has been
particularly true since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, when our two
countries have been acting together to tide over the difficulties,"" Wang said.
 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, leading the U.S. delegation, earlier said the talks
would cover many of the commercial and foreign policy issues that have sometimes created rifts
between the world's biggest and third biggest economies.
 But initial comments from both sides were upbeat.
 ""Both China and the United States are faced with many challenges and deep-seated problems,""
Wang said. ""I'm confident that through the current round we will expand common ground, narrow
differences and work together to push forward the firm and steady growth of U.S.-China relations.""

 BEIJING, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner said on Monday the United States and China need to work
together to reduce trade barriers and develop a more balanced
global economy.
In prepared remarks for delivery at an opening ceremony for
the two-day Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Geithner indirectly
urged China to ease up on its ""indigenous innovation"" policies
aimed at giving Chinese companies a larger share of new
cutting-edge technologies developed in China.
""Innovation holds the key to a more prosperous future, and
innovation flourishes best when markets are open, competition is
fair, and strong protection exists for ideas and inventions,""
Geithner said.

 Geithner made no reference in his remarks to U.S. calls for
China to let its yuan currency  rise in value but did
say the two countries should seek more balanced growth.
 ""As we reform the U.S. economy to promote savings and
investment, China is reforming its growth model to promote
domestic demand and consumption,"" Geithner said.
 Europe's woes are also expected to come up during the two
days of high-level talks. There has been concern on the U.S.
side that China may delay letting its currency resume
appreciating because it fears exports to Europe will decline.
 ""Our common interests lie in a stronger and more resilient
world economy where growth is more balanced, both within and
among nations,"" said Geithner, who leaves Beijing on Tuesday
night for talks in Britain and Germany on efforts to stabilize
the European economy and financial markets.

 * Obama urges balanced growth, touches on human rights
(Updates with Obama statement to Beijing meeting)
 By Chris Buckley and Glenn Somerville
 BEIJING, May 24 (Reuters) - China struck a conciliatory
note in talks with the United States on Monday by vowing to
spur domestic demand and keeping a guarded opening to exchange
rate reform, which the Obama administration says is needed to
rebalance the global economy.
 The United States treaded softly on the subject and
welcomed Beijing's long-standing pledge to reform the yuan as
the two sides opened their second Strategic and Economic
Dialogue.
 But both countries also made clear that a stronger Chinese
currency was not enough by itself to narrow the whopping U.S.
bilateral trade deficit that has fueled tensions between them
at a time when the global economic recovery remains fragile.
 While Chinese President Hu Jintao broke no new ground on
the yuan dispute, he set an amicable tone for the two days of
talks during which the world's biggest and third-biggest
economies will seek to steady their relations.
 ""China will continue to steadily advance reform of the
renminbi exchange rate formation mechanism following the
principles of being independent, controllable and gradual,"" he
said. The renminbi is another name for the yuan.
 Hu said his government wanted to expand domestic demand to
create more balanced growth, something that Washington --
worried about its yawning trade deficit with China -- has also
advocated.
 U.S. President Barack Obama, in statement released later in
Washington, said the two nations could collaborate.
 ""Together, we can promote economic growth that is balanced
and sustained and trade that is free and fair,"" Obama said, in
a coded reference to his desire for more yuan flexibility.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the Chinese
government was moving in the right direction on the yuan, which
has been effectively pegged to the dollar since the global
financial crisis worsened in mid-2008.
 ""We welcome the fact that China's leaders have recognized
that reform of the exchange rate is an important part of their
broader reform agenda,"" he said.
 Trying to press the case that appreciation would be in
China's own interest, Geithner said that a more market-driven
exchange rate would help suppress inflation while also driving
private firms to move up the value chain.
 TRADE POLICIES
 China and the United States signaled that there could be
progress on two other trade-related policies that have been
additional irritants in their relations.
 China said that it was working to resolve the concerns of
foreign companies about an ""indigenous innovation"" program that
the United States has said was unduly restrictive and a concern
on par with the yuan.
 And Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said he was
optimistic that the United States would loosen controls over
high-tech exports, a move that would go a small way to
balancing their trade ties.
 The talks also touched on Europe's debt woes, with both
sides saying that they were cautiously optimistic that any
fallout would be limited.
 ""The general view was that the pace of the global economic
recovery will be basically maintained,"" People's Bank of China
Governor Zhou Xiaochuan told a news conference.
 The one slight point of open discord were U.S. calls for a
tougher line against North Korea over an alleged sinking of a
South Korean warship, contrasting with China's appeals for
restraint.
 Tensions flared between Beijing and Washington in the first
months of 2010, when China denounced U.S. criticism of its
Internet censorship, Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, and
President Barack Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's
exiled leader.
 Beijing considers Taiwan a part of its territory, and Hu
said on Monday that it was important for countries to respect
one another's sovereignty.
 Obama said the strategic summit was an opportunity to
pursue other goals beyond the economy and singled out national
climate change commitments made last year in Copenhagen.
 Climate activists say China was among countries taking part
in the Copenhagen meeting who had sought and won less stringent
greenhouse gas emission targets than experts had proposed.
 Obama also touched lightly on human rights, where Beijing's
record has drawn persistent criticism, noting: ""We welcome our
human rights dialogue with China, which we began this month and
which I look forward to continuing.""
 QUIET DISCUSSION
 Beijing officials have said they want only ""quiet
discussion"" of U.S. complaints that the Chinese currency is
held too low in value, giving Chinese manufacturers an unfair
advantage.
 The Obama administration so far appears willing to go along
in the hope that a quieter approach will give Beijing more
political space to let its currency appreciate.
 The annual U.S. trade deficit with China fell to $226.8
billion in 2009 from a record $268.0 billion in 2008. But the
Obama administration is keen to lift exports, and the deficit
remains a point of friction with Beijing.

919,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2010 08:31PM ET</span>","FOREX-Euro gives back some gains, Aussie on backfoot"," * Euro gives ground as market sells into rallies
 * Aussie on the defensive, stops above $0.8365
 * Euro/Aussie pair higher as carry trades unwound
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, May 24 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Monday as
investors sold into its latest bounce, while the Australian
dollar eased as carry trades funded in the single currency
continued to be unwound on fears of a global slowdown.
 The euro  fell to $1.2525 in Asian trade from around
$1.2570 late in New York on Friday when it gained over 0.8
percent.
 It posted its first weekly gain against the greenback in six
weeks, although worries about the health of the European banking
sector were likely to check gains with near resistance seen at
around $1.2670, its May 21 high.
 At the weekend, the Bank of Spain said it was taking over the
running of Spanish savings bank CajaSur after its planned merger
with another of the country's small lenders failed
[ID:LDE64L007]. That weighed on the euro already hurt by worries
about the impact of deep public spending cuts in Greece, Spain
and Portugal.
 The euro got some respite late last week after German
lawmakers approved their country's contribution to a nearly $1
trillion bailout package, and European finance ministers
supported calls for new and tougher sanctions against countries
that break EU budget rule.
 Speculators trimmed some of the record high short positions
against the euro last week. [IMM/FX]. Still, traders said the
euro was likely to struggle in the short term.
 Euro/yen  was down at 112.76 yen, from 113.04 yen
late in New York on Friday when it jumped over 1.2 percent.
 ""The euro is still vulnerable structurally as the short
covering that we saw last week seems to have run its course,""
said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank. ""Also
the unwinding of carry trades that lifted the euro against the
Aussie last week could run into some resistance.""
 The euro rebounded sharply against the high-yielding Aussie
 last week, hitting three-month highs of A$1.5456, on
the back of a huge sell-off by hedge funds. On Monday, the pair
was trading at A$1.5135, not far from those peaks.
 Charts indicate the euro/Aussie pair put in a weekly key
reversal last week and if it closes above A$1.4777 this month, it
will put the pair in line for a monthly key reversal. And that
would not bode well for the Australian dollar.
 The Australian dollar  was down at $0.8269, from
around $0.83 late on Friday with traders reporting sizable stops
on Aussie above $0.8365. Those stops are expected to be taken out
this week which could push the Aussie to as high as $0.8425
before turning down once again.
 Indeed, positioning in the options market points to more pain
for the currency. Aussie/dollar 1-mth risk reversal
 were still showing an extreme bias for puts with
markets now favour puts by over 5 percent partly reflecting a
growing need among investors to hedge against further declines.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.37 percent at 85.69, helped
mainly by the greenback's rise against the euro and the yen. The
dollar rose to 90.17 yen  from around 89.95 yen late in New
York on Friday.

(Adds outlook for production)
 CARACAS, May 23 (Reuters) - OPEC member Venezuela will
increase oil production ""gradually"" in 2010, then even more
next year, President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday.
 Chavez's comments contradicted previous statements by oil
officials that Venezuela's production -- which they put at 3
million barrels per day -- will not increase this year.
 International energy organizations put the South American
nation's output closer to 2.3-2.4 million bpd currently.
 ""We are going to increase oil output progressively from the
end of this year, and in 2011 we will have an important rise,""
Chavez said on his weekly TV program ""Hello President"".
 Chavez gave no further explanation for his forecasts.
 Venezuela has various projects in the pipeline to increase
output from its Orinoco heavy-crude belt, but they are not
expected to start coming on stream until 2012.
 Chavez said production should rise by one million bpd
between 2010 and 2015, though state oil firm PDVSA has forecast
a production level of 5.8 million bpd in 2012.
 Venezuela has the potential to raise production five-fold
in the next two decades, the president added.
 Venezuela agreed to a 380,000 bpd cut last year in line
with OPEC reductions. But Chavez said Venezuela's planned
output increases would not clash with OPEC quotas because
""there are OPEC nations unable to fulfill their quotas because
their production has come down.""

 * North Korea may emerge as issue
 
 By Chris Buckley and Arshad Mohammed
 BEIJING, May 24 (Reuters) - The United States and China
formally open high-level talks on Monday intended to steady
their vast and sometimes tense economic relationship, but North
Korea threatened to emerge as a point of diplomatic contention.
 Any feuding over Chinese exchange rate policies, however,
appeared likely to be kept out of the limelight.
 The two countries are holding a Strategic and Economic
Dialogue (S&ED) in Beijing, and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said they would cover many of the commercial and foreign
policy issues that have sometimes created rifts between the
world's biggest and third biggest economies.
 She and some 200 U.S. officials attending the two days of
talks, however, appeared eager to play down the tensions that
unsettled relations in the first months of 2010, when Beijing
denounced U.S. criticism of its Internet censorship,
Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, and President Barack Obama's
meeting with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader.
 ""We want to take what is a positive relationship and make it
more so. It's strong but it can be stronger,"" Clinton said in
excerpts of an interview with Phoenix Television, a Hong
Kong-based broadcaster, aired late on Sunday.
 She said the issues up for discussion included bilateral
economic ties, Iran and also North Korea, which faces
international condemnation after South Korea said the North
torpedoed its warship, the Cheonan, in late March.
 South Korea said on Sunday it would take the case to the
United Nations Security Council. Speaking in Tokyo on Friday,
Clinton said the international community could not allow the
Cheonan's sinking, which killed 46 sailors, to go ""unanswered"".
 China is the sole major backer of North Korea, and has not
publicly criticised Pyongyang over the sinking, instead issuing
broad calls for restraint. Earlier this month, China hosted the
North's leader, Kim Jong-il, on a visit.
 Beijing's reluctance to censure its neighbour may become a
point of division with Washington, especially if South Korea
carries through on its vow to take the sinking to the United
Nations Security Council.
 The two nations also are expected to discuss Iran, which the
United States accuses of pursuing nuclear weapons. Iran denies
this.
 Clinton on Sunday pressed senior Chinese officials to agree
on a list of people and Iranian entities whose assets could be
frozen in fresh U.N. Security Council resolution against Iran.
 
 QUIET DISCUSSION OF YUAN
 For now, contention over China's yuan exchange rate policies
appears unlikely to break out in public at the talks.
 Beijing officials have said they want only ""quiet
discussion"" of U.S. complaints the Chinese currency is held too
low in value, giving Chinese manufacturers an unfair advantage.
 The Obama administration so far appears willing to go along
in the hope that a quieter approach will give Beijing more
political space to let its currency appreciate.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters on
Sunday that the two big economies needed to show they can act
decisively.
 ""Meeting at this time allows us to demonstrate what is a
substantial strength of both the United States and China -- a
capacity to act quickly, to solve problems, to take initiative
and to take a leadership role,"" he said in Beijing.
 But he and other U.S. officials will be looking for signs
that China will narrow the two countries' huge trade gap.
 The annual U.S. trade deficit with China fell to $226.8
billion in 2009, down from a record $268.0 billion in 2008. But
the Obama administration is keen to lift exports, and the
deficit remains a point of friction with Beijing.
 U.S. officials have sought to concentrate attention on
policies that they claim may unfairly impede U.S. companies
hunting for customers in China.

923,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2010 01:03PM ET</span>",Arizona border businesses lose key Mexican clients," * Mexico visitors boycott Arizona shops in protest
 * $1 billion-a-day U.S.-Mexico trade steady despite furor
 * More concern about economic recovery than migrant law
 By Tim Gaynor
 NOGALES, Ariz., May 23 (Reuters) - Adalberto Lopez'
family-run musical instrument shop in the bustling Arizona
border city of Nogales sells guitars and accordions to
foot-stomping banda musicians and mariachis who cross up from
Mexico to shop.
 But in mid-May, the music stopped in the store. Mexican
customers who account for almost all its sales stayed away as
part of a two-day boycott to repudiate Arizona's tough new
immigration law.
 ""The street and my shop were empty,"" said Lopez, of the
""Day Without a Mexican"" protest on May 14 and 15.
 The law may make life more difficult for border retailers
already hobbled by the recession and long border crossing
waits, and Arizona's economy could take a hit from lost
business.
 But on a larger scale, experts believe the overall trade
between the United States and Mexico, valued at around $1
billion a day, is unlikely to suffer from this latest wrinkle
in the often strained U.S.-Mexico relations.
 Passed last month, the law requires state and local police
to check the immigration status of those they reasonably
suspect are in the country illegally. Opponents on both sides
of the border say it is a mandate for racial profiling.
 Mexico President Felipe Calderon sharply criticized it
during a visit to Washington last week. Standing beside U.S.
President Barack Obama, Calderon said Mexican immigrants make a
""significant contribution to the economy and society of the
United States"" but many face discrimination ""as in Arizona.""
 The measure has triggered legal challenges, convention
cancellations, and, most recently, snubs by some of the 65,000
Mexicans who cross into the desert state each day to work,
visit family and shop, spending $7.4 million, according to a
recent University of Arizona study.
 ""The people in Mexico have been fairly insulted by this
legislation, as have most Latinos in the state of Arizona,""
said Bruce Bracker, president of the Downtown Merchants
Association in Nogales, who said local shops' sales fell 40
percent to 60 percent as Mexicans stayed home during the
boycott.
 NO TRADE SLOWDOWN
 Obama has spoken out against the law, which is backed by a
majority of Americans.
 The United States, Mexico and Canada created the world's
largest free trade block with the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1994, although the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship
has been jarred by job losses and charges of protectionism.
 Trade between the two neighbors is already ruffled by a
trucking row. Mexico is waiting for the United States to let
its trucks circulate again on U.S. roads, ending a spat that
led it to slap duties on $2.4 billion in U.S. goods.
 But analysts and customs brokers say the furor over the
state law is unlikely to disrupt the $21 billion annual flow in
goods over the Arizona-Mexico border, between clients scattered
across northwest Mexico and the United States.
 ""Once you work so hard to get a business enterprise up and
operating, how much are you willing to reverse that based upon
something that someone relatively remote from you does?"" said
Rick Van Schoik, director of the North American Center for
Transborder Studies at Arizona State University in Phoenix.
 ""Life goes on regardless of the newsy political
conversation that's going on,"" he added.
 Customs brokers in Nogales, meanwhile, who clear goods
ranging from semi-conductor chips to fresh produce headed over
the border by truck and freight train, said their clients were
more concerned about the sputtering economic recovery than the
migrant law, which is due to come into effect on July 29.
 ""The economy is one thing, but that's an ongoing situation
for everyone,"" said Nogales customs broker Terry Shannon Jr.
 ""But I have not had any dialogue with my clients at this
point where they have called me up and point-blank (asked)
'What do you think of the law? Where are we going with this?'""
 'ONE MORE OBSTACLE'
 But in cross-border retail, where sentiment plays a role in
shaping Mexican shoppers' spending, the outlook is more vexed,
business groups say.
 Informal Mexican boycotts in protest at the measure have
taken hold in other cities bordering Arizona, among them San
Luis Rio Colorado, south of Yuma, where some traders are opting
to head to California and Nevada to buy appliances and cars.
 ""They're looking for other options,"" said Juan Manuel
Villarreal, president of the city's chamber of commerce, adding
that it is still too early to quantify the impact.
 Authorities in Nogales -- the state's principal trade
gateway to Mexico -- were unable to place a dollar value on the
recent boycott by Mexican shoppers, whose spending accounts for
nearly a quarter of all jobs in surrounding Santa Cruz County,
and almost half of taxable sales.
 But Olivia Ainza-Kramer, president of the Nogales-Santa
Cruz County Chamber of Commerce said a backlash from the law
piled pressure on local shops, restaurants and hotels already
hurt by the recession and delays of up to two hours for
customers crossing up from Mexico.
 ""This is one more obstacle that's getting in the way,"" she
said.

 * Under NAFTA, Washington agreed to allow Mexican trucks to
haul goods on U.S. roads. But a spending bill passed by the
U.S. Congress eliminated funding for a pilot program.
 * In response, Mexico slapped retaliatory tariffs on $2.4
billion of U.S. products in March, and accused U.S. lawmakers
of bowing to protectionist pressures from union leaders.
 * Arizona has border crossings with Mexico in six towns and
cities, from Yuma in the west, to Douglas in the east.
 * Last year, 27.9 million people crossed legally to Arizona

 * Mexican visitor spending in Arizona was almost $2.7

 MADRID, May 23 (Reuters) - Spain will not bow to union
pressure and revise a 15-billion-euro ($18.76 billion) austerity
plan, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero said on
Sunday.
 ""I know there are protests by those who do not share them
(government views), like the unions, but we will not change,""
Zapatero told his Socialist party in Elche, southeast Spain.
 With the Greek debt crisis shaking world markets, Zapatero
is under pressure to make spending cuts while pushing through
long-awaited labour reforms to avoid a similar loss of
confidence in Spain.
 ""No one can doubt at any time that Spain is a strong country
and an economic power that will meet its obligations and pay
debts,"" he told a meeting of 2,000 Socialist mayors who face
municipal elections next year.
 Earlier on Sunday, the leader of Spain's largest union
reiterated that he might call a general strike over cuts he saw
as unfair and unnecessary.
 Zapatero said he respected the unions, who have called for a
strike on June 8 by civil servants who will have wages cut by an
average of 5 percent this year.
 
 FUTURE FOR WELFARE
 He said cuts approved by the cabinet on Thursday would
reduce social spending by 1.5 percent, but that this had risen
by 50 percent since he took power in 2004.
 ""We have to make this effort to save now so that tomorrow
the development of a welfare state and equal opportunities may
continue,"" Zapatero said in his first address to the party since
he unveiled the cuts on May 12.
 He reiterated calls for agreement on a long-awaiited labour
reform, which the government hopes to achieve this week in a
country where one in five of the workforce are jobless.
 ""I call on society as a whole, especially businessmen and
unions, to reach a good labour accord as soon as possible, so
that young people may have more hope of finding work, and those
with temporary contracts may have more hope of a stable job,"" he
said.
 Agreeing a labour reform deal is a huge challenge as it will
have to provide the job security the unions want and flexibility
demanded by big business. 
 Labour leaders writing in the ABC newspaper on Sunday said
government cuts could thwart an agreement. Analysts say an
agreement may be reached, but it is unlikely to provide the real
change its EU partners want to see.
 Zapatero reiterated that the government may ask wealthier
Spaniards to make a bigger contribution to efforts to cut the
budget deficit, which last year was 11.2 percent of gross
domestic product.
 ""Those who have greater economic means must be asked to make
a greater effort, and that is what we will do,"" he said, but
gave no details of possible tax hikes which were predicted in
local media reports last week.

 By Martin Roberts
 MADRID, May 23 (Reuters) - Spanish union leaders said on
Sunday the government's short-term austerity programme has
soured them on resolving the crucial longer-term issue of labour
reform in a country where one in five is jobless.
 With the Greek debt crisis shaking world markets, Spanish
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is under pressure to
make spending cuts while also pushing through long-awaited
reforms to avoid a similar loss of confidence in Spain.
 Labour reform talks among business, unions and the
government resumed in February and the government had hoped for
a deal by the end of May.
 But on Thursday the cabinet approved 15 billion euros of
government spending cuts, including an average 5 percent cut in
civil servants' wages, to rein in its deficit and convince
markets Spain's public finances are under control.
 Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, leader of Spain's biggest union,
Comisiones Obreras (CCOO), said the government would meet with a
""tough response"" if workers are not happy and reiterated that he
might be compelled to call a general strike.
 ""If the government persists in cutting workers' rights, it
will meet with a tough social response, and we don't rule out
that this could lead to a call for a general strike,"" Toxo wrote
in the ABC newspaper on Sunday.
 ""Things can be done otherwise: reforming the financial
system, bringing back taxable items that have been eliminated
and tackling tax evasion,"" he said.
 
 AGREEMENT UNCERTAIN
 Agreeing a labour reform deal is a huge challenge to the
participants, as it will have to provide the job security the
unions want and the labour flexibility demanded by big business.
 ""The objective conditions for achieving it (agreement) look
uncertain,"" Candido Mendez, leader of Spain's second-largest
union, the UGT, wrote in ABC.
 ""The first problem is that the government has decided on a
package of social cuts which will not achieve the aim of cutting
the deficit because they will stifle economic growth,"" he said.
 Mendez also said he would reject any proposal by business
leaders to reduce the cost of firing workers.
 Reform of the labour market is aimed at reducing the number
of temporary contracts, easing the costs of hiring and firing,
encouraging the use of part-time contracts and bringing the
long-term unemployed and the young back into the jobs market.
 Also writing in ABC, the chairman of the Spanish business
association CEOE said he was optimistic.
 ""We cannot wait for the crisis to be solved for us from
abroad, and for our problems to end when the economy revives,""
Gerardo Diaz Ferran wrote.
 Analysts have said that while some sort of deal may be
reached on reform, it is unlikely to provide the real change its
EU partners want to see to strengthen Spain's limping economy in
the long term.

 MADRID, May 23 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister George
Papandreou ruled out defaulting on debt payments or
restructuring in a Spanish newspaper interview published on
Sunday.
 ""We have no need for defaulting on payments or
restructuring,"" Papandreou told El Pais. ""We have opted not to
do so. We have opted to pay back the loans we have requested.""
 When asked, Papandreou said he did not believe his
government would reach a point beyond which it could not ask
people to tighten their belts further in order to convince
markets its public finances were in order.
 ""That is what we have decided, and that is the reason why we
have this programme of measures from the European Union,"" he
said.
 EU governments are trying to regain investors' confidence
after months of turmoil that have pushed many euro zone member
states' borrowing costs sky high led to a 110 billion euro
bailout of Greece and the setting up a $1 trillion safety net to
try to prevent the contagion spreading.
 Papandreou said he thought EU governments had been slow to
act in order to prevent the Greek crisis spreading to other
members of the 16-country euro currency.
 ""The EU took time to realise that speculators' attacks on
Greece were just a step before attacking other countries and
even threatening the stability of the euro zone,"" he said.
 The debt crisis has provoked huge instability in the
11-year-old euro currency and led to demands for EU states to
work much harder on coordinating their economic policies and
bring their finances into check.
 Harsh spending cuts in Greece which have led to violent
riots have been matched by austerity measures in Spain and
Portugal, whose wide budget deficits have also helped to roil
financial markets.
 
 SPAIN AND PORTUGAL
 ""Spain and Portugal were not so bad, but they have been
victims of hysteria,"" Papandreou said.
 The Prime Minister said that austerity measures would
curtail growth in the Greek economy, and called for the EU to
provide stimulus measures.
 ""We have to create the necessary conditions for growth and
in this, once again, the EU can help,"" he said. 
 ""Whether by pushing ahead with infrastructure projects or
creating the necessary backdrop for more investment in the EU,
concretely in the southern countries, and also in central and
eastern Europe.""
 Papandreou said he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had
been ""sincere with each other"", but added there was ""resentment""
between the two countries over the cost of the bailout and
pressure to enforce austerity measures.
 ""It is not irreparable. I would say there is resentment. But
I believe what bothers people is what we consider prejudice and
stereotypes.""
 Legislators in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, on
Friday approved the $1 trillion safety net, but Merkel failed to
secure the broad backing she had sought to ease public hostility
to bailing out weaker euro zone states.

 NEW DELHI, May 23 (Reuters) - To its admirers, India's
ruling coalition has had a good year -- sound fiscal policy to
stave off a ruinous global credit crisis, fast growth and some
tentative steps toward reforms.
 Those are likely to be stressed by Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh when he gives a news conference on Monday to mark the
coalition's first year in office.
 But to its critics, his government has floundered on
inflation, struggled ineffectively against a Maoist insurgency,
and managed its political allies so badly its substantial
parliamentary majority dwindled, hurting its ability to pass
pro-market legislation needed to sustain robust growth.
 A sense of bullish self-confidence marked the Congress
party-led coalition's handsome re-election victory last May,
spurring hopes of firm governance and quick policy changes.
 A slew of crises then undercut that electoral momentum,
emboldened the opposition and weakened Congress's hold on
allies.
 What may be more important though is that many investors
remain optimistic India eventually will take steps to open the
insurance, banking and retail sectors to overseas players, and
India has too much potential for them to ignore in any case.
 Incremental progress on structural reforms is the best they
can hope for in a country of more than a billion people and 20
official languages still emerging from a socialist past.
 ""We do not expect any radical implementation,"" said
Shubhada Rao, chief economist of Yes Bank in Mumbai.
 ""But we want the government to progressively start thinking
about opening up the economy cautiously. The government's
reforms agenda is clearly outlined; what is needed is clarity
on the road to implementation.""
 Last May's election gave Prime Minister Singh a freer hand,
no longer relying on the communist parties that propped up his
first term government.
 GOOD MARKS FOR THE ECONOMY
 Many investors wanted cuts in subsidies for fuel,
fertiliser and food. They expected the government to move fast
on removing supply bottlenecks blamed on state-controlled
prices as well as poor roads and rail.
 Instead, the coalition spent much of the year fighting
political fires, from public anger over high prices to
criticism over a growing Maoist insurgency and a high-profile
ministerial resignation over a cricket funding scandal.
 ""The government should have been stronger, instead it moved
from one bungle to another,"" said Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a
leading newspaper columnist writing about India's political
economy.
 In March, Singh lost some of his key allies as he tried to
push through a bill reserving parliamentary seats for women.
The thinning majority sent jitters through Congress before it
cobbled the numbers to defeat a parliamentary vote on high
prices.
 While many say the government's response to inflation, now
running at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent, was the single
biggest failure, its overall handing of the economy has been
praised.
 Car sales are up 40 percent year-on-year, industrial output
grew by 10.4 percent in 2009-10 and consumer durables
production surged by 30 percent in the last five months.
 Recovering quicker than expected from the global crunch,
India's economy is forecast to grow at more than 7 percent this
year and nearly 9 percent in 2011.
 The government has also moved to sell stakes in some
state-run firms, worked on a new tax code and is moving to
repair public finances. It has sold spectrum to telecoms firms,
which is expected to bring much needed funds for the budget.
 SUSTAINING GROWTH?
 To sustain grown, investors will be looking to the prime
minister to introduce policies to improve India's dilapidated
roads, ports and airports and allow India's large savings to be
channelled into productive returns.
 Analysts expect Singh to continue to support, but make slow
progress on, bills that would liberalise insurance and banking
and open up retail, which could resolve supply bottlenecks
contributing to high inflation.
 Another likely slow mover, given problems with Congress's
allies, will be a nuclear liability bill needed to allow entry
of U.S. atomic energy firms into India.
 ""Gradualism punctuated by political compulsions will
probably remain the key mantra,"" Macquarie Research said in a
new report that rated the governing United Progressive Aliance
performance at an uninspiring six on a scale peaking at 10.
 With 42 percent of Indians living on less than the poverty
line of $1.25 a day, reforms have always been a political hot
potato. Many farmers who receive subsidies for rice and wheat
helped Congress win last year's election.
 ""There is a lack of consensus within the Congress party and
it is now increasingly clear the Left was only an excuse for
postponing many important decisions needed to accelerate
growth,"" N.K. Singh, former finance secretary wrote in the Mint
newspaper.
 Despite lack of big-ticket reforms, foreign firms and
investors are getting on with business undeterred. India's
long-term potential is too compelling to ignore.
 ""India is a delectable emerging economic story that suffers
an unfortunate - but legitimate -- discount because of its
government's poor management and implementation,"" the Macquarie
report said.

 * Clinton raises concerns about Chinese procurement rules
 * China calls for stability in face of European troubles
 * Bernanke holds talks in China, scant details
 
 By Arshad Mohammed and Glenn Somerville
 SHANGHAI/BEIJING, May 23 (Reuters) - The United States on
Sunday pressed China to give ""fair access"" for foreign
companies, and China stressed the risks both economies face from
Europe's debt woes, ahead of top-level talks in Beijing.
 Speaking in China's commercial epicentre, Shanghai, a day
before the start of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED)
in Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized
the importance of U.S. economic concerns for relations with
China.
 ""In the coming days, officials at the highest levels of our
two governments will be discussing issues of economic balance
and competition,"" Clinton said in a speech given in a vast
hangar at Shanghai airport, referring to the Beijing meeting.
 ""Transparency in rule making and standard setting,
non-discrimination, fair access to sales to private sector and
government purchasers alike, the strong enforcement of
intellectual property rights are all vitally important in the
21st century global economy,"" Clinton told the audience of U.S.
and Chinese business executives.
 ""American companies want to compete in China,"" she said,
standing in front of a Boeing 737. ""They want to sell goods made
by American workers to Chinese consumers with rising income and
increasing demand.""
 Clinton's remarks underscored how large economic concerns
will loom at the two-day S&ED meeting, jostling for attention
with a range of other issues, including North Korea.
 The United States' annual trade gap with China fell to
$226.8 billion in 2009, down from a record $268.0 billion in
2008. But the Obama administration is keen to lift exports and
employment, and the deficit remains a point of friction with
Beijing.
 The imbalance has fuelled accusations from the U.S. Congress
and manufacturing sector that China is manipulating its currency
for an unfair trade advantage by keeping the price of its yuan
artificially low against the dollar.
 On Sunday, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Ben
Bernanke met in Beijing with Vice Premier Wang Qishan, the
official overseeing the Chinese side of the economic dialogue,
the official Xinhua news agency reported.
 ""They exchanged views on issues including global economy and
finance, and the reform on financial supervision system,"" said
the brief report, which gave no other details.
 But U.S. and Chinese officials have stressed that the
meeting in Beijing will not be dominated by the yuan.
 In comments published on Sunday, China's Finance Minister
Xie Xuren said cooperation with Washington was all the more
important in the face of the European debt crisis.
 ""At present, risks from European sovereign debt have
increased factors of instability in the course of global
economic recovery,"" Xie wrote an essay published in the
Washington Post and on his Ministry's website (www.mof.gov.cn).
 China and the United States must ""each protect macro
economic stability and strengthen macro-economic policy
coordination, to consolidate the trend towards global economic
recovery,"" Xie wrote.
 Xie's remarks jarred those of a senior U.S. Treasury
Department official who said ahead of the talks with China that
Europe's crisis should have only minimal impact on the global
recovery as governments put in place counter-measures.
 There has been speculation that China may delay letting its
yuan currency rise in value -- as Washington has urged -- out of
concern that its exports to Europe will suffer.
 The U.S. Treasury official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, repeated it was China's choice to decide what to do
about its currency peg but expressed hope Beijing would keep
boosting domestic consumption and rely less on exports.
 
 PROCUREMENT RULES UNDER CHALLENGE
 Clinton followed other U.S. officials who have sought to
concentrate attention on policies that they claim may unfairly
impede U.S. companies hunting for customers in China.
 U.S. officials say they are particularly worried about
China's ""indigenous innovation"" programme to promote homegrown
technology, which they say is creating barriers to foreign
companies seeking to win government supply contracts for
high-tech equipment, energy technology and other sophisticated
products.
 China says its procurement rules do not unfairly
discriminate against foreign companies, but also last month
partly modified those rules after rising criticism from U.S. and
European companies and governments.
 The Chinese Finance Minister Xie said that his country and
the United States both benefited from their trade and should
oppose protectionism.

regulations to prevent another financial crisis and develop
foreign exchange markets to deal with sudden capital flows, a
senior central bank official said on Sunday.
 The country also needs to have a ""proper level"" of foreign
exchange reserves, said Kim Kyung-soo, the head of the Bank of
Korea's Institute for Monetary and Economic Research.
 ""It is necessary to secure a macro prudential policy and
strengthen regulations in order to prevent a recurrence of a
financial crisis,"" Kim said in a abstract of a thesis, which he
worked on with an International Monetary Fund researcher.
 Kim did not provide details on which financial regulations
the country needs to toughen.
 ""The issues should be discussed further in an international
body such as G20,"" he told Reuters by telephone, adding other
countries also need to strength regulations.
 South Korea is hosting the November summit of the Group of
20 with some of the world's leading economies such as Germany,
France and Britain pushing for a global bank tax scheme along
with stricter regulations on banks. But some others including
Canada oppose the idea.
 Last week, Financial Services Commission Chairman Chin
Dong-soo said the country would look at extra measures to
cushion the impact from a possible sudden shift in cross-border
capital flows. [ID:nTOE64H098]
 On the foreign exchange reserves, Kim said he did not say
what level of foreign exchange reserves was appropriate, adding
he did not mean the country must increase or decrease the
reserves.
 ""To supplement vulnerability revealed during a financial
crisis, it is necessary to secure (a) proper level of foreign
exchange reserves with consideration of possible crisis and
effectiveness,"" he said in the abstract provided by the central
bank.
 South Korea's foreign exchange reserves in April posted
their biggest monthly gain in five months to a record high of
$278.87 billion. [ID:nSUL000044]
 Kim's remarks came as financial markets globally,
including
South Korea's, have been hit by the euro zone's debt problems.
 At the height of the global financial crunch in late 2008,
many foreign bank branches had to send their money back to
their cash-starved headquarters, causing a currency squeeze in
the local market.

 * Considers more M&A in China's construction gear sector
 * Intends to expand ties with Dongfeng Motor
 * Sees closer tie between rivals as natural consolidation
 
 By Fang Yan and Jacqueline Wong
 SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters) - Volvo , the world's
second largest truck maker, expects Asia to overtake Europe as
its largest market by 2015, helped by robust demand in India and
China, its chief executive said on Saturday.
 While growth is tapering off in mature markets in Europe and
North America, Volvo, along with rivals Daimler AG 
and MAN , are increasingly turning to Asia for business
opportunities.
 ""If everything continues as I see them today, then you can
see slow development in the U.S. and Europe and very quick
growth in India and China,"" Leif Johansson told Reuters in an
interview in Shanghai.
 ""Right now, Japan is still reasonably big, but the quickest
growing markets are India and China. I would expect India and
China to be 60 or 70 percent of our Asia sales by 2015.""
 As of the end of the first quarter, Asia was Volvo's second
largest market, contributing to 24 percent of its global sales,
according to company data.
 The Swedish trucks and engineering group, which controls
major Chinese gear maker Shandong Lingong Construction
Machinery, would consider more acquisitions in China, where
demand for construction equipment has been strong thanks to a
booming economy.
 ""We are looking at different opportunities to grow. One of
those opportunities is to grow by acquisition,"" said the chief
executive.
 Volvo, which makes heavy-duty trucks under the Renault,
Mark, UD trucks and Eicher brands, also intends to expand its
tie with China's Dongfeng Motor Group Co <0489.HK>, China's
number two automaker by sales as of the end of April.
 Dongfeng has a manufacturing tie-up with Nissan Diesel
, a former commercial vehicle arm of Nissan Motor
<7201.T> but now fully owned by Volvo.
 Local production of more of its truck brands was an option,
Johansson said, even though no specific decision has been made.
 Daimler AG operates a joint venture with Beiqi Foton Motor
<600166.SS>, while Navistar International Corp  and
China's Jianghuai Automobile <600418.SS> have initially agreed
to set up joint venture. [ID:nSHA47413]
 
 NATURAL CONSOLIDATION
 Earlier in the month, Volkswagen , which has 71
percent of Scania  votes and nearly 30 percent of MAN's
, laid out the case for closer ties among the three to
take on bigger rivals Dailmer and Volvo.
 Talk of closer links between the three vehicle makers has
heated up in recent weeks, stoked by industry kingpin Ferdinand
Piech, chairman of both Volkswagen and MAN, who is on a quest to

946,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2010 08:03AM ET</span>","US claims on copyright piracy ""groundless""--China"," SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters) - The Foreign Ministry has
dismissed as ""groundless"" U.S. accusations that China is failing
to crack down on copyright piracy, ahead of talks with top U.S.
officials next week, Xinhua News Agency reported on Saturday.
 It quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu as saying
China had implemented policies to combat piracy in copyrighted
films, music, videogames and other entertainment products.
 ""The involved U.S. Congress members should respect the fact
and stop making groundless accusations against China,"" he said.
 Chinese leaders will hold talks on Monday and Tuesday in
Beijing with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
 While a range of issues will be addressed, including Chinese
trade policies and the yuan exchange rate, intellectual property
rights will be of major importance.
 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said earlier this week
that Washington would use the economic talks to press China on
copyright piracy and innovation.
 The United States placed China and Russia at the top of a
piracy list earlier in May.
 However, Ma said protecting intellectual property rights was
of great importance to the Chinese government and that combating
piracy had become part of its national strategy.

 * U.S. dollar rising due to confidence in U.S. economy
 * U.S. to tackle deficit issue seriously

(Adds details, background)
 SHANGHAI, May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner said a strengthened global economy is now in better
shape to handle the strains emanating from Europe's crisis,
China's Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday.
 ""You see some of the challenges in Europe now. But I think
we are in a much stronger position to manage those challenges,""
he told Xinhua in an interview in Washington before heading to
Beijing for high-level economic discussions.
 Geithner also said the dollar was on the rise because
confidence was growing about the strength of the U.S. recovery.
 The U.S. Treasury chief was due to arrive in Beijing on
Sunday for meetings of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue,
co-chairing the U.S. side with Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton.
 The economic component of the Monday and Tuesday talks are
expected to explore ways to better balance the two countries'
$400-billion trade ties, steering clear of an open clash about
the yuan's peg to the dollar.
 The United States still has the world's largest economy and
China has the fastest-growing one, so Geithner said cooperation
between the two was vital for healthy global growth.
 ""China and the United States are doing what we need to do to
help contribute to a broader global economic recovery,"" he said.
 The U.S. administration is going to tackle the deficit
situation very seriously, Geithner told Xinhua. As he tries to
reinvigorate the U.S. economy, President Barack Obama has set a
goal of doubling exports in five years, which can be met only
with a big increase in sales to China.
 Geithner said both the U.S. and Chinese economies have
undergone a major transformation in recent years and struck a
theme that he is expected to pursue by praising rising levels of
domestic consumption in China.
 The Obama administration has been urging China to rely less
on exports, and more on increased consumer spending at home, to
fuel its economic growth. Geithner also noted that the U.S.
economy's expansion now was being led by investment and exports,
rather than consumer spending, and that savings were rising.
 
 EUROPE CONCERN
 Europe's debt crisis has become an issue of concern, partly
for fear that it might spread to other regions but also because
it means a diminished market for exports from countries like
China.
 That has led to speculation that Beijing will be less likely
to let its yuan currency rise in value, as the Obama
administration was urging, since the euro's decline has made
Chinese products more expensive in its top export market.
 A $1 trillion safety net, provided by EU nations and the
International Monetary Fund to stabilise the euro zone --
following a rescue of debt-ridden Greece -- has not stopped the
bloc's currency tumbling.
 Several euro zone governments have followed Athens in
announcing or planning austerity measures to shore up their
credit ratings and avoid having to seek a Greek-style bailout.
 But doubts remain about their ability to push through savage
spending cuts in the teeth of public opposition.
 Geithner added last-minute stops in Britain and Germany to
his itinerary when the S&ED talks wrap up on Tuesday to discuss
conditions with his counterparts in London and Berlin and with
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet in
Frankfurt.

 * Swiss franc safe haven status to strengthen further
 
 ZURICH, May 22 (Reuters) - Switzerland will feel the
consequences of the euro crisis as growth in the whole of the
Europe area is expected to be sluggish over the next few years,
the Alpine country's president was quoted on Saturday as saying.
 Swiss Economy Minister Doris Leuthard, who holds the
rotating post of Swiss President this year, said in an interview
with Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung that she was more
worried about the overall economic impact of the crisis than
wild currency fluctuations.
 ""In June the new economic forecasts will draw the first
conclusions on the repercussions (of the euro crisis),"" Leuthard
said. ""I am not chiefly worried over the currency problems. More
worrisome is the fact that the weakness of the euro and the
rescue package that goes with that will weigh on the economic
development of the whole European continent.
 ""We have to get used to the idea of very moderate economic
growth in the European Union area over the next years,"" she
said.
 Leuthard said the Swiss National Bank together with the
Finance Ministry and Economy Ministry had all intensified
monitoring of the situation, which has seen the franc rallying
to all-time highs against the euro -- the currency of its main
trading partners -- this week.
 Leuthard expressed concern about the 750 billion euro ($938
billion) EU emergency debt package to avert an unprecedented
crisis for the euro zone. Germany's parliament gave its key
support to the austerity plan on Friday. [ID:nSGE64K06K]
 ""(The package) represents an implicit state guarantee,"" she
said. ""There will be therefore less pressure on heavily-indebted
euro zone nations to do their homework and introduce the
necessary reforms.
 ""This creates uncertainty and dampens economic growth,
something that Switzerland will also feel. There is a risk that
the Swiss franc's safe haven status will further strengthen.""

 NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro and U.S. stocks rose
on Friday as chances of currency intervention and clarity on
Wall Street reforms made investors hedge bets ahead of the
weekend after heavy selling on Europe's festering debt crisis.
 U.S. banking shares rallied a day after the United States
Senate approved a sweeping overhaul of regulations covering
financial firms. The Senate bill reduced uncertainty over how
hard the legislation could hit bank profits. Investors saw
chances it would not be as tough on Wall Street as feared.
 Skittish trading on a day when many U.S. equity options and
some options on stock indexes expire contributed to market
volatility.
 The euro headed for its first weekly gain versus the U.S.
dollar in six weeks as investors who had bet on the currency's
decline bought it back on fears of central bank intervention.

 While European shares closed lower they did bounce up from
eight month lows. Latin American equities rallied on the back
of U.S. market gains with the theme of neutral positioning
running through global markets.

going into the weekend. I don't think it is anybody buying, but
more of people just squaring off (positions),"" said Vitali
Meschoulam, emerging markets macro strategist at Morgan Stanley
in New York.
 ""You have headline risk both ways, making it hard to take a
very strong directional view in the market because there is
still a fair amount of uncertainty,"" he added.
 U.S. Treasuries fell as stocks rose while gold lost ground
for a fifth consecutive day after reaching a record high one
week ago. Crude oil pared earlier losses, a day after touching
a seven month low.
 Euro zone sovereign debt problems have not been solved but
there was progress in the rescue process. German lawmakers on

 * Investors rush to exit riskier trades, buy dollars
 * Some funds buying euros, despite this month's losses
 By Jennifer Ablan and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - The ferocious appetite for
risk-taking in everything from Peruvian debt to global
financial stocks has evaporated in a matter of weeks, if not
days, and the biggest losers in the unwind have been
concentrated in currency funds.
 In May alone, funds that heavily invest in currencies,
including the euro, Australian dollar and Russian ruble, have
been the worst-performing, according to a Lipper analysis of
all fixed-income funds, ended May 20, which includes currency
portfolios. For the complete list, please see [ID:nN21161889]
 While the biggest losses so far this month are in the
Australian Dollar Shares exchange-traded fund , down
nearly 12 percent, funds with euros have been suffering for
much longer. The Australian dollar is down about 12 percent
since April 30, with most of the losses incurred in just over a
week, according to Reuters data.
 ""There's been risk reduction because of the reassessment of
the global economic recovery, or lack thereof, thanks to the
euro zone,"" said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at
Omnivest Group in Princeton, New Jersey.
 The euro has been battered, down 12 percent year-to-date
against the dollar and 15 percent versus the yen, as worries
continue that Greece and other euro countries will not be able
to control spiraling fiscal deficits. The single currency still
remains under selling pressure, down about 6 percent between
April 30 and May 20, even as the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund last week pledged about $1 trillion
for Greece and other euro countries.
 The euro, which hit a four-year low of $1.2143 
earlier this week, traded at $1.2570 on Friday.
 Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer at Merk
Investments in Palo Alto, California, said that as the euro
plunged this week, he added even more to his Merk Hard Currency
Fund (MERKX) -- one of the top 20 losers of all fixed income
and currency funds in May, down 6.53 percent.
 ""If anything, it all reinforces my strategy. I still
believe there's value in the euro,"" Merk said in an interview
on Friday. ""Obviously, it is very hard to make money every day
when everybody is piling on the same trades, with a lot of
confusion in the markets ... something has to give. There's not
a lot of places to hide.""
 Jeff Tjornehoj, research manager at Lipper Inc, a funds
research firm owned by Thomson Reuters, said narrowly focused
strategies have posted ugly returns during the risk unwind.
 ""There are emerging market debt funds on the list because
some hedge in local currencies ... they suffer owing to the
strength in the U.S. dollar,"" Tjornehoj said.
 Investors have been rushing to exit positions on the euro
while paring bets in favor of most higher-yielding currencies,
including the Australian and New Zealand dollars, the Brazilian
real and the South African rand -- which have been caught in
the unwind of ""risk"" trades.
 In turn, traders have been flocking to the U.S. dollar, the
Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and even gold, perceived as safe
havens in times of global economic turmoil.
 Currency funds as diverse as Swedish Krona Shares ,
Franklin Templeton Hard Currency (ICPHX) and Mexican Peso
Shares  all recorded losses in the past month. 
 Still, for fund managers like Merk, investors hurrying to
pull the plug on the euro and other riskier trades should pause
and think again.
 ""By no means I'm married to the euro. But when the whole
world is writing about one single trade, when it becomes the
cover of all magazines, it is a sign that the trade is
overdone,"" he said. ""I may be early. But I'd rather be early
than late in this game.""

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, May 21 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar fought back
from a 14-week low on Friday, lifted by rebounding equity
markets and robust domestic data that kept alive the
possibility of a June 1 interest rate increase.
 The currency touched a high of C$1.0551 to the U.S. dollar,
or 94.78 U.S. cents, bouncing off a low of C$1.0753 to the U.S.
dollar, or 93.00 U.S. cents, its lowest level since Feb. 9.
 The rally was supported by figures that showed Canadian
inflation was higher than expected in April, while retail sales
in March soared from February. [ID:nN21149251] [ID:nN21207192]
 ""From the data that came out this morning it was relatively
positive in the sense that the Canadian economy seems to be
humming,"" said Rahim Madhavji, president of Knightsbridge
Foreign Exchange, a commercial foreign exchange dealer.
 Madhavji said that, based on the strong inflation reading,
the market has raised expectations for an interest rate hike,
which would boost the Canadian currency.
 ""That being said, one of the things that they will continue
to consider over the next week or two is the crack in the glass
in Europe and how far that spreads.""
 All of Canada's primary securities dealers still forecast
the Bank of Canada will start raising interest rates in June to
cool a strong domestic economy, but they caution that the
fallout from Europe's debt crisis mean a rate increase is not
certain. [ID:nN21160493]
 Market volatility arising from the region's sovereign debt
woes and tougher financial regulation has dramatically eroded
the market's sense of pending rate increases.
 Central bank rate hike expectations, reflected in yields
on overnight index swaps, have fallen hard from April 20 when
the Bank of Canada removed its conditional commitment to hold
rates until June.
 At that point the market was pricing in more than a 90
percent chance of a June 1 hike, compared with about 54 percent
on Friday. 
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0593 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.40 U.S. cents, up
from Thursday's close at C$1.0678, or 93.65 U.S. cents.
 However, the currency ended the week 2.6 percent lower.
 In a note to clients on Friday, RBC Capital Markets' chief
technical strategist, George Davis, said the currency had to
close stronger than C$1.0204 in order to end the current
selloff.
 The Canadian dollar also got a lift as equity markets
reversed earlier losses to turn positive as worries about
Europe's debt levels eased and prospects for economic recovery
brightened. [ID:nSGE64K06K] [ID:nN20244272]
 Both the Toronto and New York markets closed more than 1
percent higher after after being pummeled in recent sessions.
 BONDS DROP
 Canadian bond prices fell across the curve, as rallying
equity markets, robust economic data and rate-hike expectations
lured investors back to riskier assets.
 Earlier in the day, bond prices rallied, even after the
strong economic data.
 ""It was very much the fear and pain trade at the start of
the day, which it's been all week,"" said Roger Quick, director
of fixed-income research at Scotia Capital.
 Once stock markets began to rebound, ""that brought a little
confidence back and so now the market's been trading a little
bit more off the fundamentals.""
 The two-year government bond  dropped 16 Canadian
cents to C$99.62 yield 1.692 percent, while the 10-year bond
 sank 43 Canadian cents to C$101.14 to yield 3.365
percent.
 ""The fundamentals are still good for Canada and they would
still suggest that the Bank of Canada is going to be raising
rates,"" Quick added.
 Bond prices tend to fall when interest rates go up as their
low-yielding fixed payments seem less lucrative compared with
rising yields on other investments.
 Canadian bonds lagged their U.S. counterparts, with the
30-year bond 30 basis points below the U.S. 30-year yield,
compared with 35 basis points below on Thursday.
 The Canadian bond market closed at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT) ahead
of the holiday weekend. Financial markets are closed on Monday
for Victoria Day.

 By Kevin Gray
 BUENOS AIRES, May 21 (Reuters) - Argentina's economy grew
at its fastest pace in nearly two years in March, expanding a
sizzling 8.1 percent from a year earlier as brisk industry
activity strengthened a recovery, the government said.
 There were other signs that Latin America's No. 3 economy
is putting last year's sharp slowdown behind it. Factory
production soared in April and the trade surplus narrowed as
demand for imported goods continued to pick up.
 ""The rebound is giving way to pure growth in the first
quarter,"" said Enrique Dentice, an economist at the University
of San Martin.
 Increasing auto production, rising consumer spending and a
rise in farm exports have helped lift Argentina's economy.
 The March economic growth sharply exceeded the 6.3 percent
median forecast in a Reuters poll and was the quickest since
July 2008.
 The monthly economic activity indicator, known as EMAE and
which measures most components of gross domestic product, was
up 1.0 percent in March versus February.
 Growing demand in Brazil is fueling automobile production
in Argentina, Latin America's third-largest carmaker.
 Argentine industrial production rose 10.2 percent in April
from the same month last year and was well above the median
forecast of 8.3 percent in a Reuters poll.
 In other data also released on Friday, Argentina's trade
surplus shrank by 15 percent in April from the same month a
year ago to $1.93 billion.
 Official Argentine data has been widely questioned by
economists who say the government is underreporting inflation
and exaggerating growth and industrial production for political
reasons.
 While analysts say the outlook this year for industrial
production, a key indicator of the economy, is positive, they
warn high inflation could boost wage demands and erode the
local currency's competitive edge over trade partners.
 Private economists forecast inflation at between 20 percent
and 30 percent by year's end.
 Government data also showed Argentina's unemployment rate
dipped to 8.3 percent in the first quarter, down from 8.4
percent in the first three months of 2009.
 The jobless rate also dipped from the fourth quarter, when
it stood at 8.4 percent.
 The Argentine economy grew 0.9 percent in 2009, according
to the government, but many analysts say it contracted by 2
percent or more.
 The government forecasts growth of 5 percent this year.

 NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday,
heading for its first weekly gain versus the U.S. dollar in six
weeks as investors who had bet on the currency's fall bought it
back on fears of central bank intervention.
 The Australian dollar jumped on speculation Australia's
central bank may step in to support the currency. The Aussie is
on track for its biggest weekly drop since October 2008,
hammered by worries the euro zone debt crisis could hinder a
global economic recovery.
 The euro gained for a third straight session after German

trillion bailout package, and European finance ministers
supported calls for new and tougher sanctions against countries
that break EU budget rule. [ID:nLDE64K17F]

euro has certainly found its footing,"" said Andrew Wilkinson,
senior analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich,
Connecticut.
 ""There has also been some market rumors that central banks

However, the very suggestion is enough to make investors pare

 In late New York trading, the euro rose 0.9 percent to
$1.2575  after climbing as high as $1.2673 on electronic
trading platform EBS. It is poised to end the week 1.8 percent
higher against the dollar, following five weeks of losses.
 The euro has fallen roughly 5.4 percent against the dollar
this month. Its steep decline has cranked up speculation
European officials may be concerned about its level.
 The Australian dollar  rose 1.9 percent against the
U.S. dollar to $0.8314, pulling back from its lowest level
since July 2009, hit on Thursday, and on track for a weekly
loss of 6.2 percent. It was also up 4.1 percent against the yen
.
 ""The aussie/yen is a good proxy for the risk trade and the
yen has done well on the move away from risk in Europe,"" said
David Kupersmith, head trader at Third Wave Global Investors, a
global macro hedge fund in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""It has
nothing to do with the economic situation in Australia or Japan
though there are signs Australia is slowing down.""
 EURO BOTTOMS?
 The euro zone single currency tumbled to a four-year low of
$1.2143 on EBS on Wednesday after Germany banned naked short
selling in some securities, fueling speculation about other
possible market regulations.
 But it has rebounded sharply since then, leading some
investors to speculate whether the currency has reached a
bottom.
 ""It's very possible that we've seen a medium-term low. We
could be back at $1.30 this time next week,"" Interactive
Brokers Group's Wilkinson said, referring to the euro/dollar.
""People have baked into the cake so many negative assumptions
about where the euro could go.""
 Currency speculators slightly trimmed their bets against
the euro, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Friday. The net short position on the euro fell to
107,143 contracts from the record net short position of 113,890
contracts the prior week. See [ID:nN21246724]
 Other analysts, however, remained bearish on worries about
the impact of deep public spending cuts in Greece, Spain and
Portugal on the outlook for growth and monetary policy.
 ""The fundamental outlook for the euro is still poor,"" said
Jessica Hoversen, a fixed income and currency analyst at MF
Global in Chicago. ""Given the massive fiscal consolidation that
you're going to see in Europe, the outlook for their real
economy is poor.""
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro  traded 0.5
percent higher at 1.4429, having recovered sharply from a slide
to an all-time low around 1.3995 francs earlier in the week.

electronic trading platform EBS. It is poised to end the week
1.8 percent higher against the dollar, following five weeks of
losses.
 The euro zone single currency tumbled to a four-year low of
$1.2143 on EBS on Wednesday after Germany banned naked short
selling in some securities, fueling speculation about other
possible market regulations.
 The Australian dollar rose 1.5 percent against the U.S.
dollar to $0.8276, pulling back from its lowest level since
July 2009 hit on Thursday and on track for a weekly loss of 6.6
percent. It was also up 3.3 percent against the yen.

nothing to do with the economic situation in Australia or Japan
though there are signs Australia is slowing down.""
 EURO BOTTOMS?
 Germany's parliament approved a bill to allow Berlin to
contribute to the European rescue aid for Greece and other euro
zone nations plagued by debt problems. Merkel said on Friday
the vote sends a strong signal on ""European stability
culture.""
 The euro has fallen roughly 5.5 percent against the dollar
this month. Its steep decline has cranked up speculation
European officials may be concerned about its level.
 It also got a boost after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said on Friday the euro was not in danger
and was a credible currency.
 ""It's very possible that we've seen a medium-term low. We
could be back at $1.30 this time next week,"" Interactive
Brokers Group's Wilkinson said, referring to the euro/dollar.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro traded 0.5 percent higher
at 1.4434, having recovered sharply from a slide to an all-time
low around 1.3995 francs earlier in the week.
 Concerns harsh fiscal tightening in Europe may hinder
global growth have heightened fears about risk and prompted a
rush to square positions across asset classes this week.
 ""Risk aversion has risen so rapidly that in order to
protect their books, investors are just closing positions and
repatriating capital,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at

 * New data suggests recovery weak
 * PM Putin upbeat on economy
 * Rouble ends week in steep fall 
 
 By Oksana Kobzeva and Darya Korsinskaya
 MOSCOW, May 21 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank has slashed
its forecast for loan growth this year, a senior official said
on Friday, and other data showed the economy still struggling as
cheaper oil adds to worries over growth and public finances.
 Central bank board member Mikhail Sukhov told Reuters the
bank had slashed its forecast for growth by around 10 percentage
points though he added corporate loans grew by 0.9 percent in
April from March -- the first increase since November 2009. 
 The central bank sees loan growth as key to an economic
recovery and previously forecast loans would rise 15 percent
this year while Sberbank, the country's No.1 lender, said it
expected its portfolio to increase by about 10 percent. 
 ""A forecast of five percent growth or just above is
reasonable,"" Sukhov said.
 The government and the central bank pushed billions of
dollars into Russia's banks in 2009 in a bid to revive credit
growth but despite abundant liquidity and bullying by the
country's leaders, banks remain cautious.
 Other data on Friday also suggested the recovery remains
fragile, with capital investment picking up by 2.3 percent in
April in year-on-year terms [ID:nLDE64K14I], a far cry from the
double digit rates seen before the credit crisis. 
 Retail sales, once the driver of Russia's economic growth,
rose 4.2 percent year-on-year [ID:nLDE64K0ZZ] while real
disposable income grew 3.7 percent year-on-year [ID:nLDE64K14R].
 The rouble ended a nervous week in a steep fall, losing
ground on global risk aversion and weaker oil that prompted
foreigners to ditch rouble assets, and dealers say further
losses are possible next week. [ID:nLDE64K1NR]
 
 COMFORTABLE OIL PRICE
 The rouble had seen a sustained rally as investors pushed
money back into riskier emerging market assets and the recovery
of commodities like metals, oil and gas made mineral-rich Russia
a relatively safe bet. 
 But the oil rally has slackened amid worries over the global
recovery and that increases risks both to Russia's own growth
outlook and its budget planning -- which largely depend on the
dollar revenues the sector provides.
 Moscow forecasts the economy to expand 4.0 percent this
year. That to date had been seen by many analysts as too
conservative, because it was based on oil prices averaging just
$76 a barrel.
 Urals , Russia's main export blend of oil, traded at
around $69 per barrel on Thursday, and Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said that Russia was comfortable with a price of between
70 and 80 dollars per barrel. He maintained the government would
cut its budget deficit to 5.5 percent in 2010 from 5.9 percent
last year and further to 3.0 percent in 2012. 
 ""The oil price is ... comfortable for us, allowing Russian
companies to develop and generate revenues for the state
budget,"" Putin said during a meeting between prime ministers
from EVRAZES, a grouping of ex-Soviet countries. 
 Putin also said that Russia was ready to start cutting
import duties and roll back other protectionist measures
introduced last year at the height of the economic crisis.
 Russia raised customs duties on 350 products ranging from
cars to agriculture mashinery to rolled steel in a bid to
protect domestic producers. Putin did not elaborate which
duties could be reduced and when.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Friday,
heading for its first weekly gain versus the U.S. dollar in six
weeks, as investors who had bet the currency would fall further
bought it to prevent losses in case of currency intervention.
 Investors were jittery about holding significant positions
in the euro and other currencies given some market-moving
announcements have been made on weekends this month.
 The Australian dollar, down 6.6 percent on the week against
the U.S. dollar, jumped on speculation Australia's central bank
may intervene to support the currency. A high-yielding currency
seen as a measure of global economic risk, the Aussie was set
to suffer its biggest weekly drop since October 2008.

 Worries about the economic impact of the euro zone debt
crisis drove the single currency to a four-year low versus the
U.S. dollar this week.
 The stampede out of the euro pushed net short positions in
the single currency to a record high last week, with the
current week's speculative positions on the euro to be released
late on Friday.

 It tumbled as low as $1.2143 earlier this week after

 Analysts said heightened fears about risk had prompted a

which are high-risk or less liquid.
 ""Risk aversion has risen so rapidly that in order to
protect their books, investors are just closing positions and
repatriating capital,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at
SEB in Stockholm, adding: ""It's a snowball effect.""
 This flight to safety soaked up liquidity, resulting in
choppy trade and aggravated currency movements.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro  traded 0.5
percent higher at 1.4432, having recovered sharply from a slide
to an all-time low of 1.3995 francs earlier in the week. 
 The Australian dollar  rose 1.7 percent against the
U.S. dollar to $0.8267, pulling back from a low which was its

 * Some progress made on intellectual property, brands
 
 BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - China has taken encouraging
steps to address concerns about its policy to promote domestic
innovation by imposing unfavourable terms on foreign companies,
but problems remain in areas that could hurt foreign investors,
the European Union's trade chief said on Friday.
 Beijing is drafting legislation that will encourage
government bodies to buy goods and services developed in China
-- what is being called ""indigenous innovation"".
 Foreign firms fear some of the provisions will hamper the
sale of products developed outside China. They also worry that
poor intellectual property protection will discourage them from
registering patents or conducting sensitive research in China.
 ""We see it as a positive signal that the Chinese authorities
have published a revised draft version of the accreditation
procedure ... comprising some major amendments,"" EU Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht told a news conference.
 De Gucht said moves to address concerns over brand and
intellectual property rights were particularly encouraging.
 ""However, there are still problems. The European Commission
noticed that there are some concerning provisions which remain
such as the requirement to locate research and development in
China,"" he said after meeting Chinese trade minister Chen
Deming.
 The EU's trade chief, reponsible for trade policy for the
27-nation European Union, said the bloc would continue to work
with Chinese authorities to resolve outstanding issues.
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, in Beijing on Friday,
also aired concerns over indigenous innovation policies and
other Chinese barriers to market access.
 Speaking at the press conference in Brussels after a joint
EU-China committee meeting, Deming said China was seeking fair
resolution of the issue and hoped the solution would have a
criteria which could be applied to all economies.
 ""We also believe that this is a precondition for the
equitable and fair competition and cooperation between EU and
Chinese businesses,"" Deming said.

 NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro jumped against the

said the single currency was not in danger and U.S. stocks
pushed higher, led by bank shares a day after the U.S. Senate
passed the most sweeping overhaul of financial regulation since

 But worries about euro zone sovereign debt crisis continued
to take a toll on investors' appetite for risk, U.S. Treasuries
debt prices rose through most of the morning as fears that
global fiscal tightening would crimp an economic recovery drove
a bid for safety, but turned as stocks rose. European shares
hit a more than eight-month low but pared losses after the
comments on the euro by the ECB president, Jean-Claude
Trichet.

plan for the euro zone. [ID:nSGE64K06K] [ID:nN20244272]
 Skittish trading on a day when many U.S. equity options and
some options on stock indexes expire contributed to market
volatility.
 The price of spot gold, which hit a record high one week
ago, was down for a fifth consecutive day, while crude oil
pared earlier losses, a day after touching a seven-month low.
 The euro traded up 0.66 percent at $1.2547 , on pace
for its first weekly gain against the greenback in six weeks.
Bearish sentiment against the currency had become so extreme in
the midst of the Greek-led debt crisis that investors started
to buy the euro zone currency in case of intervention.
 European finance ministers were to meet later on Friday to
discuss changes to budget rules to prevent another Greek-style
debt crisis.
 ""These are still relatively illiquid market conditions with
real money pushed to the sidelines,"" said Michael Woolfolk,
senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York. ""The

 On Wall Street, stocks jumped in late morning trade,
reversing early losses which had seen the Dow Jones industrial
average dip below the psychologically significant 10,000 point
level.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 70.36

 In Japan the Nikkei <.N225> closed down 2.5 percent and
lost 6.5 percent on the week, its biggest weekly drop in more
than a year.
 SAFETY?
 As global share prices cut losses, there was some paring
back of money going into European government debt.
 The June Bund future  shed around half a point from
a record high of 128.97. By 1452 GMT, the contract was at
128.56, up 25 ticks on the day.
 ""The stock market is rallying and so they're selling back
Bunds, we're just in that mentality at the moment,"" said a
trader in London.
 The premium investors demand to hold Spanish, Italian and
Greek sovereign bonds rather than German benchmarks fell. The
10-year Spanish/German government bond yield spread
 narrowed by 5 basis points from the

austerity budget on Tuesday to cut the deficit by some 24
billion euros in 2011 and 2012, aiming to lower it to 2.7
percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from 5.3 percent last
year.
 No details were released after the cabinet meeting but the
budget's main features had already been announced by officials
and released in draft documents.
 Following are reactions to the package.
 
 JAMES WALSTON, POLITICS PROFESSOR, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF
ROME
""It seems the lion's share of the savings are in cuts in
regional and local government funding. That means health and
schools, which will hurt a lot of people.
 ""All the public sector workers will feel the pinch too, but
... what we have today is a proposal. The big conditional clause
is: ""Is he (Berlusconi) going to be able to do it? He has to get
it through parliament and then implement it over the next two
years. He has a very uphill job now because what he has done so
far is spread the message that everything is fine, and he has
more or less succeeded thanks to his control of the media.
 ""Now he will have much more trouble spreading that feelgood
message, especially as many Italians think this package is just
the beginning of the sacrifices. (But) ""...I still don't see it
(the government) in danger of falling in the near term.""
 
 GUGLIELMO EPIFANI, HEAD OF ITALY'S LARGEST UNION, THE CGIL
 ""We have already helped the banks so we are now paying twice
for what the financial speculators have done.
 ""If I am a Fiat worker I pay, if I am a civil servant I pay
even more, if I am wealthy I don't pay a cent and I dont think I
can agree with this.
 ""This is a budget that cuts and hurts consumption and has a
negative impact on the economy. It's unfair because the usual
suspects are paying and it doesn't give any boost to economy.""
 DAVIDE STROPPA, UNICREDIT MIB
 ""It's encouraging that most of the correction is taking
place through expenditure cuts, rather than through higher
taxes.
 ""Spending cuts are more credible and tend to have
longer-lasting effects than budget corrections based on higher
taxes. They can even be growth-enhancing, if they are credible
and if they are well accepted by the markets.
 ""While we welcome the decisiveness of the Italian government
in taking action on the budgetary front, we think the next step
should focus on the introduction of 'zero-cost' measures to
increase potential growth.""

 GILLES MOEC, DEUTSCHE BANK
 ""With a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 5.3 percent of GDP in 2009
(roughly half that of Portugal and Spain), the combination of
these austerity measures with even a mediocre improvement in
growth should be enough to bring the deficit below three percent
of GDP by 2012.
 ""Replacing only one in five retiring civil servants, on top
of a wage freeze in the public sector, seem to be the flagship
measures. Italy is choosing a 'medium way' between the Spanish
radical approach of wage cuts and a 1-10 replacement ratio, and
the French more benign programme of a 1-2 replacement ratio and
no wage cut.
 Italy's big issue still is the level of public debt, at
115.8 percent of GDP in 2009. However, contrary to Greece,
there has been no fiscal drift in the recent period. For
instance, the public sector accounted for 15.6 percent of total
employment in Italy in 2009, against nearly 18 percent in the
mid-1990s.
 ""Also, 56 percent of Italian public debt is domestically
held. Since the private sector debt is one of the lowest in
Europe, Italy is less at risk than the peripherals of a
catastrophic de-leveraging.
 ""Some cabinet members will probably try to resist some of
the austerity measures, highlighting the differences with the
peripherals. But (Economy Minister) Tremonti has been pushing
for an orthodox fiscal policy since the start of the economic
downturn, and his political standing has improved recently. The
Lega Nord (Northern League), which supports him, was the clear
winner of the last regional elections.""

 * Economists wary of recession risk but not yet calling it
 * Weaker euro may help exports and growth as austerity bites
 
 By Brian Love
 PARIS, May 21 (Reuters) - Europe's economic prospects took a
further hit on Friday as news of drops in German business morale
and the pace of recovery in business activity across the euro
zone as a whole raised the risk of a slide back into recession.
 Economists, wary of the harm that austerity could do to
growth as governments strive to slash debt, said a ""double-dip""
recession could not be ruled out, but that they did not yet see
it as the most likely scenario. A weakening euro could also
boost exports and limit the likelihood of such a relapse.
 ""We are monitoring, very carefully, financial markets to
understand how concrete the risk of a double dip is,"" said Marco
Valli, an economist at UniCredit bank in Milan.
 ""So far, our financial markets index signals stress, but not
to a level that may suffice to lead to an area-wide recession.""
 In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, two monthly surveys
took unexpected turns for the worse, and an update on first
quarter growth confirmed that gross domestic product grew a slim
0.2 percent, as was the case for the euro zone as a whole.
 On Thursday news of a sharp decline in consumer sentiment at
euro zone level highlighted the risk to morale and economic
activity as the debt crisis prompts cuts in wages and other
public spending, as well as tax hikes to limit debts.
 The consumer sentiment indicator compiled from a monthly
European Commission survey fell to a seven-month low in May,
dipping to -17.5 from -15.0 in April 
 Germany's Ifo think-tank said that its business climate
index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, had
dropped for the first time since February. While marginal, the
dip to 101.5 from 101.6 in April bucked expectations.
 A purchasing managers' index compounded the concerns,
showing Germany's private sector expansion had slowed in May as
a peak in inventory rebuilding checked output and order growth.
 A flash estimate, or preliminary readout, of the composite
PMI index for manufacturing and the service sector fell to 55.5
from 59.3 in April. The index nevertheless remains well above
50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction.
 Those surveys all give something close to a real-time sense
of economic health. Other information showed Germany, which
shook off recession in the second quarter of 2009, kept its head
above water in the first quarter of 2010, but only just.
 The GDP update showed that Germany was saved from a lapse
back into contraction by inventory building, which helped
outweigh sharp dips in private consumption and construction. 
 
 AUSTERITY THE BIG UNKOWN
 The data did nothing to arrest a slide in stock markets,
which fell again on Friday as investors worried about a downturn
caused by the accelerated austerity measures that markets have
pushed governments into pursuing.
 While economists hope for a better performance in the second
quarter from Germany and the euro zone, they have yet to come to
terms with any drag thereafter as additional austerity bites.
 ""It (recession) is certainly a growing risk. It is not our
central forecast although we do expect growth to be slower in Q3
and Q4 compared to Q2, and to be muted,"" said Howard Archer,
chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, a consultancy.
 For now, Archer and others have at least some reason not to
make renewed recession their main call.
 Service sector expansion for the euro zone as a whole showed
its fastest expansion rate since August 2007 in May, PMI surveys
released on Friday suggested, rising to 56.0 from 55.6 in April.
 However, the euro zone manufacturing sector, which drove a
large part of the euro zone's exit from a year-long recession in
the third quarter of last year, saw the pace of growth slow from
last month's near four-year high in PMI readings.
Beyond the high-frequency indicators of economic activity,
which are not dismal so far, the fact that the euro has weakened
considerably may also offer the region's economy a boost by
helping exporters compete better on price, especially when much
of the demand growth on that front is in Asia.
 The euro has dropped around 13 percent against the dollar
since the start of the year.
 ""The weak currency is helping to counter some of the nasty
effects of financial stress and the envisaged fiscal tightening
in the periphery,"" Frankfurt-based Commerzbank chief economist
Joerg Kraemer said.
 Debt and debt-shrinking austerity measures are most acute in
Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, but the fact that these
account for only around 15 percent of euro zone GDP suggests
that the as yet unquantified toll of austerity will be limited.
 However, of the larger economies, France and Italy have
close trading links with the stricken south of Europe, which
accounts for only around 12 percent of German exports.
 Euro zone GDP contracted more than 4 percent last year, far
more than a dip in U.S. GDP of around 2.4 percent. The European
Commission last week forecast a recovery that would raise GDP
just 0.9 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent in 2011, compared to
U.S. GDP rises of 2.8 percent and 2.5 percent.
 If the euro's decline leave it lastingly at something close
to $1.20, slightly above where it started when the currency was
launched in 1999, euro zone GDP could get a lift and turn out
closer to 2-2.5 percent in 2011, said Marc Touati of the French
brokerage Global Equities.

 BERLIN, May 21 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister David
Cameron told Germany on Friday that Britain needs a stable euro
currency, although he would not agree to any EU treaty changes
that drew Britain further into supporting the euro.
 ""Britain is not a member of the euro nor are we likely to
become a member of the euro, but we want a strong and stable

goes and it is in our interests that that takes place.""

made Germany his second foreign destination as British leader
after visiting Paris the previous day.
 At their joint news conference, Merkel, who spooked money
markets this week by saying the ""euro is in danger"", said she
and Cameron had ""talked about how important a stable euro also
is for countries who don't belong to the euro zone"".
 Germany caused market mayhem earlier this week by acting
alone, and without consulting its European Union partners, to
ban naked sort selling of certain financial instruments, which
helped push the euro to a four-year low and routed stocks.
 Cameron, asked whether he planned to imitate this ban,
replied: ""In Britain it would be a matter for the Financial
Services Authority and obviously we should respect each others'
decisions on these issues.""
 Some of Germany's euro zone partners were less phlegmatic,
with the French government and European Commission voicing
irritation at the unilateral move, and U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner saying such measures tended to be unhelpful.
 Cameron said debate should focus instead on the ""real
causes"" of the problems suffered by European economies, citing
their excessive debt and deficits as well as financial system
and banking failures ""that have dragged our economies down"".
 ""Those are the problems, we have to tackle the problems, and
get to the source of the problems, and then we will find the
symptoms will be less of a problem,"" he said.
 
 ""NO TRANSFER"" OF POWER TO BRUSSELS
 Cameron voiced his admiration for the German chancellor's
""determination and leadership"". Merkel had expressed her fears
before the British election month that eurosceptic tendencies in
his party could weaken the EU if it came to power.
 Such tendencies in his centre-right Conservative party may
be toned down by its partnership with the centre-left Liberal
Democrats, and Cameron said he had asked Merkel for advice due
to experience leading an earlier German ""Grand Coalition""
between her conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats.
 ""I am sure this will be the start of a very strong and
positive partnership based on results and practical actions in
the interests of our countries,"" said Cameron regarding his
future relationship with Berlin.
 He stressed areas of agreement and said they would work
together on the G20 and G8 agendas ""particularly in terms of
banking regulation, making sure that banks are serving our
economies rather than our economies serving banks"".
 But, reiterating that Britain was unlikely to join the EU
currency union, Cameron said there was ""no question"" of London
accepting any EU treaty change ""that transfers power from
Westminster to Brussels"".
 That contrasts with earlier comments by Merkel, who has said
that changes to the EU treaty are unavoidable if the bloc wants
to learn from the Greek debt crisis.
 Cameron said Britain ""wouldn't agree to any arrangements or
treaty that drew us further into supporting the euro area"",
stressing that this would require unanimous support of all 27 EU
member states -- ""including the UK, which of course has a veto"".

 NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Friday and was set for its first weekly gain against the dollar
in six weeks, as investors who had bet the currency had further
to fall instead bought euros to prevent losses in case of
currency intervention.
 The Australian dollar, down almost 7 percent on the week
against the U.S. dollar, jumped on speculation that Australia's
central bank may intervene to support the currency. A
high-yielding currency seen as a measure of global economic
risk, the Aussie was set to suffer its biggest weekly drop
since October 2008.
 The RBA said it does not comment on market movements.

 A stampede out of the euro amid worries about the economic
impact of the euro zone debt crisis drove the single currency
to a four-year low versus the dollar this week. This also
pushed net short positions in the European currency to a record
high last week, with the current week's speculative positions
on the euro to be released late on Friday.
 ""These are still relatively illiquid market conditions with
real money pushed to the sidelines,"" said Michael Woolfolk,
senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York. ""The
market is controlled by speculators and they can push it around
a fair bit.""
 The euro has fallen roughly 5.5 percent against the dollar
this month, and its steep decline has cranked up speculation
that European officials may be concerned about its level.

did not see the need to take immediate action on the euro's
decline, but speaking in Tokyo, he said he discussed its

 On Friday, the euro  climbed as high as $1.2673 on
electronic trading platform EBS in early trade. It last traded
at $1.2560 up 0.7 percent on the day.
 It tumbled as low as $1.2143 earlier this week after
Germany banned naked short selling in some securities, fuelling
speculation about other possible market regulations.
 The euro is poised to end the week roughly 1.7 percent
higher against the dollar, following five weeks of losses.

 Analysts said heightened fears about risk had prompted a
rush to square positions -- long and short -- in currencies
which are high-risk or less liquid.
 ""Risk aversion has risen so rapidly that in order to
protect their books, investors are just closing positions and
repatriating capital,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at
SEB in Stockholm, adding: ""It's a snowball effect.""
 Risk aversion soaked up liquidity, resulting in choppy
trade and aggravated currency movements.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro  traded 0.5
percent higher at 1.4435, having recovered sharply from a slide
to an all-time low of 1.3995 francs earlier in the week.
 The Australian dollar  rose 1.7 percent against the
U.S. dollar to $0.8234, pulling back from a low which was its
weakest since July 2009. The Australian dollar was up 1.6
percent against the yen , after touching its lowest

965,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2010 09:43AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Rattled by regulatory recidivism," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - It may be a cliche, but it is
true -- nothing upsets markets more than uncertainty.
 Heading into a new week, investors are beset by it, hammered
by worries over everything from potentially slowing economic
growth and striking workers to wrenching changes in currency
rates and fears about boisterous populism among governments.
 Berlin's ban on speculators and Washington's plans for bank
reform have come as additional headaches for those wanting to
know what the future will bring.
 With no one factor dominating markets except fear, the
volatile mood is likely to continue into a week that includes a
meeting of G20 negotiators, U.S.-China economy talks and a visit
to Europe from U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.
 Financial markets, in the meantime, have been growling like
a bear.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> has
lost around 12 percent this month with its emerging market
counterpart <.MSCIEF> down some 14 percent.
 The euro, rattled by the debt crisis, has fallen more than 5
percent this month against the dollar  and is down 12
percent for 2010.
 Safe haven U.S. bond funds are among the few beneficiaries
of the mood, according to the lastest flow data from fund
trackers EPFR Global. [ID:nSGE64K034]
 Many of the latest moves were triggered during the past week
by a renewed worry hitting investors, that of governments moving
to regulate the way markets work in way not seen for decades.
 Germany rather spectacularly shocked investors with its
immediate ban on naked short selling of euro zone government
bonds and shares in 10 leading German financial institutions, as
well as transactions in credit default swaps (CDS) linked to
euro government bonds.
 Although many investors reckoned the impact itself would be
limited, the idea that governments might suddenly do something
along those lines greatly unsettled them.
""It creates quite a lot of unnecessary uncertainty. The
concern is that we are now in an environment where legislation
is being rushed through without thinking about it,"" said John
Stopford, head of fixed income at Investec Asset Management.
 Germany was not alone in seeking to change the rules.
 The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved a well-flagged, but
nonetheless sweeping Wall Street reform bill designed to prevent
future government bailouts of financial institutions and to
protect consumers.
 
 MEETING FOCUS
 With this in mind, investors will be nervously looking on at
a series of high-level meetings in the coming week at which the
world's current economic and market imbalances will be on the
agenda.
 Negotiators, or sherpas, for the Group of 20 nations meet in
Calgary early in the week to put together plans for a summit
later in the year in Toronto and a finance ministers meeting in
Busan, South Korea.
 A G20 deputies meeting in Berlin on May 19 discussed the
fact that while the ""real"" economy is recovering, disruptions in
financial markets continue, according to one official present.
 It could well be brought up again in Calgary.
 The United States and China, meanwhile, meet for what is
dubbed a strategic and economic dialogue on Monday and Tuesday
with the U.S. view that China's yuan is undervalued haunting the
background.
 The dollar's broad-based rise against other major currencies
-- sparked by the euro's troubles, but also a general flight to
safety -- may make life harder for U.S. exporters but it has
also made a Chinese yuan move less likely.
 One result may be that the two sides will find agreement
about the need to stem the euro's slide, particularly as the
yuan has risen 11 percent against the euro since mid-April.
On his way home from China, meanwhile, U.S. Treasury chief
Geithner has decided to stop over in Europe, partly to meet new
British counterpart George Osborne but also to have talks with
euro zone officials.
 He will meet European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet in Frankfurt and German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schauble in Berlin on Thursday.
 Geithner said in a CNBC television interview that he wants
to see Europe stick with agreed plans for restoring economic
stability to the region.
 He said it was important to keep moving on the
750-billion-euro package of loans -- from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund -- to prevent the European debt
crisis from spreading.
 
 NO CAPITULATION
 While there is no doubt, meanwhile, that investors are
rattled by the return of regulatory pressure and other worries,
the flight to safety has not been unambiguous.
 EPFR Global's flow tracking showed that as well as U.S. bond
funds becoming popular, supposedly higher-risk emerging market
bonds continued to attract investors.
 They had net inflows of $533 milion in the week to May 19.
Record inflows were seen for the asset class in both March and
April.
 At the same time, EPFR noted that money market funds, the
safest of safe havens, saw net outflows of $33.9 billion.
 ""(It suggests) that sentiment has not turned to the point
where capital preservation is the overriding concern,"" the firm
said.

 * Still many uncertainties in global economic recovery
 
 By Bate Felix
 BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - China will continue to ease
monetary policy moderately as many uncertainties remain about
the strength of the global economic recovery, China's commerce
minister said on Friday.
 ""The world economy still has quite a lot of uncertainties
and therefore we believe it is still too early for us to talk
about an exit strategy from stimulus packages,"" Chen Deming told
a news conference in Brussels.
 Deming, who is in Brussels to attend an EU-China joint
committee meeting, said the Chinese government ""would continue
to implement a proactive fiscal policy, while moderately easing
monetary policy as part of its macroeconomic policies"".
 China has come under increasing pressure from Western
governments to allow the value of its yuan currency to rise,
with critics saying the pegged currency is undervalued and gives
Chinese exporters an unfair advantage.
 ""The currency issue is a sovereignty issue of a country and
China will continue to proceed towards the direction of its
reform,"" Deming said through an interpreter.
 Deming said the value of the yuan had appreciated by 15
percent against the euro in recent months, including a 7 percent
gain in the past month. That, however, is largely due to euro
weakness.
 The Commerce Ministry, as a staunch defender of Chinese
exporters, is at odds with the People's Bank of China over
whether the government should abandon the yuan's de facto peg to
the U.S. dollar.
 ""What has happened has actually further proved our judgment
of the current global economic situation. And that is to say
there are still uncertainties and a tough way ahead of us,""
Deming said.
 Deming said China was closely watching the sovereign debt
crisis in Europe, adding that he hoped and believed measures
taken by the EU and the IMF would end the crisis as soon as
possible. China looked forward to a stable and strong euro, he
said.

 * Most economists say ECB credibility damaged by bond buys
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Hundreds of billions of euros
earmarked by the EU to fight the euro zone debt crisis have done
little to improve the chances of Greece avoiding a debt
restructuring in the next five years, a Reuters poll suggested.
 Forecasts from the survey of 36 economists also showed the
European Central Bank's credibility has been hurt by its
purchase of government bonds from euro zone issuers, having long
held out against such measures.
 The poll showed a median one in three chance that Greece
would restructure its debt pile in the next five years.
 Despite the EU's announcements of a 110 billion euro package
directed at Athens and a $1 trillion safety net for euro zone
states, that figure was a little higher than the 30 percent seen
in an April 28 poll with a larger sample. That poll was taken
before both measures were announced.
 Respondents in the latest survey also gave Portugal a 20
percent chance each of a debt restructuring in the next five
years, and Spain and Ireland a 10 percent chance.
 Reuters's long-term euro zone economy poll published last
week suggested the safety net would bring calm to markets, but
the euro has performed dismally this week, hitting a four-year
low against the dollar on Wednesday, and stock markets have
slumped.
 Asked what more policymakers can do to turn sentiment
around, economists in Friday's poll pointed to deep-rooted
structural reforms spanning the 16-nation bloc.
 ""(It's) hard to foresee miracle moves,"" said Luca Mezzomo of
Intesa Sanpaolo.
 ""EU governments should fix the structural weaknesses of the
surveillance system over private and public financial
imbalances, set up a convincing mechanism to deal with (the)
crisis and work on credible consolidation programmes for
government accounts.""
 Other respondents said EU governments had to close ranks
with far greater enthusiasm.
 Germany shocked markets late on Tuesday when it introduced a
ban on some short-selling of assets without consulting EU peers,
which ECB Governing Council Member Nout Wellink on Thursday
described as ""not helpful"".
 ""Policymakers have to demonstrate greater cohesion within
the European Union and have to go ahead with stricter regulation
on financial markets,"" said Paula Carvalho of Banco BPI.
 
 CREDIBILITY CRIMPED
 The ECB announced on May 10 it would start buying government
bonds outright from euro zone issuers to help support ravaged
markets -- a scenario long resisted by policymakers and one that
President Jean-Claude Trichet said had not been discussed in its
May 6 policy meeting.
 Out of 34 respondents, 28 economists said the ECB's bond
purchase programme had caused at least some damage to its
credibility.
 Fifteen said its credibility was ""somewhat damaged"", with
three saying ""significantly"" and 10 ""slightly"".
 Pollsters on average said the central bank should spend 100
billion euros on the programme but forecasts ranged widely from
nothing at all to 750 billion euros.
 Economists have seldom criticised the ECB in past Reuters
polls. In January, they assigned a healthy 8-out-of-10 for its
performance in 2009.
 Twenty out of 36 economists said it was ""very unlikely"" that
a major euro zone country would decide to leave the euro in the
next five years.
 But six said such a scenario was ""likely"", with another 10
describing it only as ""unlikely"" -- underscoring a nagging
uncertainty about the viability of the pan-European currency
that was unthinkable only six months ago.

 * Seeking to shore up euro, guard against debt meltdown
 * Germany pushing for stricter compliance, penalties
 * EU ""taskforce"" to draw up conclusions by October

(Adds EU President news conference) 
 By John O'Donnell and Felix Bate
 BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - European Union finance
ministers broadly supported calls for new and tougher sanctions
against countries that break EU budget rule on Friday, in a move
to shore up the euro and guard against a debt meltdown.
 The ministers were meeting at an inaugural gathering to
discuss changes to the way the 27-nation bloc manages public
finances and coordinate economic policy, as investors drop the
euro, pushing the common currency down 6 percent this month.
 ""We discussed sanctions and I can say that ... there is a
broad consensus on the business of having financial sanctions
and non-financial sanctions,"" European Union President Herman
van Rompuy, who chaired the talks, told a news conference.
 ""Everyone was ready ... if we need, to go ahead with new
sanctions that are not provided for in the Stability and Growth
Pact,"" he said, referring to the EU's budget rules.
 The ministers' discussions, which will continue until
October, were based on last week's proposals from the executive
European Commission and ideas from Germany which wants to go
further than the EU executive arm.
 Both sets of proposals call for swifter and broader
sanctions for countries that repeatedly break the EU's deficit
limit of 3 percent of GDP. For full details see [ID:nLDE64B20P].
 Both also call for mechanisms to make countries bring their
debt levels below the EU ceiling of 60 percent of GDP.
 EU governments are trying to regain investors' confidence
after months of turmoil that have pushed many euro zone member
states' borrowing costs sky high, led to a 110 billion euro
bailout of Greece and the setting up a $1 trillion safety net to
try to prevent the contagion spreading.
 The debt crisis has provoked huge instability in the
11-year-old euro currency, shared by 16 countries, and led to
demands for EU states to work much harder on coordinating their
economic policies and bring their finances into check.
 ""This is only the start of the process... But there was a
strong political will among the European Union finance ministers
to move forwards on the EU's budget rules,"" Van Rompuy said.
 One of the proposals of Germany, where public opinion has
been angered by emergency loans to Greece which for years broke
EU budget rules and manipulated statistics to hide it, was to
create a mechanism for an orderly sovereign default.
 But Van Rompuy stressed such a mechanism was only a
long-term option, not something that would be considered as part
of the 3-year Greek emergency package or the 3-year euro-zone
750-billion-euro safety-net for other euro zone states.
 ""It is only in a long-term context that one member country
considered that if a permanent crisis resolution framework were
to be developed in the future for the euro area, consideration
should be given to a procedure for orderly state insolvencies,""
he said. ""In the short-term, nobody proposed that kind of
scheme.""
 EU finance ministers, or their representatives, will meet
twice more before June 17 and prepare a progress report for EU a
summit of leaders. The conclusions of the talks will be
presented for an EU summit in October.
 Germany has said that the challenge of reforming EU budget
rules was such that no option should be excluded, even ones that
involve change to the EU's basic structure -- the EU treaty.
 But given the long and cumbersome process of renegotiating a
treaty, finance ministers agreed on Friday to first focus on
solutions that would be easier to implement.
 ""(In the future) we will discuss even issues which may
require an amendment of the (EU) treaties,"" German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after the talks.
 ""First, though, we will do what we can do without treaty
changes and then examine the options,"" he said.

ahead with investments in Greece's largest port Piraeus despite
the crisis that has hit the Greek economy and sent shockwaves
throughout the euro zone.
 Greece is battling a 300 billion euro ($375 billion) debt
and boosting foreign investment and competitiveness is a
challenge for the Socialist government as it imposes painful
belt-tightening measures in return for 110 billion euros of EU
and IMF aid.
 ""I do believe we will bring a lot of opportunity for the
Greeks and for the Greek economy,"" said Captain Wei Jiafu,
president and CEO of Cosco Group, which operates the world's
largest bulk cargo fleet.
 ""Cosco will materialise the agreement and will fulfil its
duties and responsibilities.""
 Cosco is the No.7 container shipping firm globally and
controls port operator Cosco Pacific.
 Cosco signed a guaranteed 3.4 billion euro concession deal
with Greece in 2008 to run and upgrade port facilities for up to
35 years aiming to turn state-owned Piraeus port (OLP) into a
regional hub, according to OLP figures.
 ""We set up this port as a hub port and to link three
continents, south, east and middle Europe, Africa and Asia,"" Wei
said.
 Cosco Pacific started operating one of OLP's piers in
October and has said it will build one more pier by 2015.
 After meeting Greek government and Piraeus Port officials
this week Wei said Cosco was also interested in setting up a
distribution centre in Piraeus, to transport Chinese goods to
the wider region and vowed to hire Greek workers.
 Greece's major ports saw container pile-ups in 2008 as
dockworkers, fearing job cuts, refused to work overtime in
protest at the concession deal.
 Dockworkers joined some thousands of Greeks in a general
strike and 25,000-strong march in Athens on Thursday against
government austerity measures such as salary cuts, tax hikes and
a planned pension reform.
 Asked whether he was concerned over the repeated strikes Wei
said he believed Greece would tackle its debt crisis and create
a good environment for overseas investors. He said the
government assured Cosco its operations would not be hindered.
 ""The time of Cosco's concession agreement with the port of
Piraeus is not 35 days or 35 months, instead it is 35 years,""
Wei said. 
 ""From the long-term perspective Cosco firmly believes any
problems of the crisis that arise can be tackled by the
understanding, the mutual trust between Cosco and the Greek
people and the Greek government.""

 * Level playing field, not privatisation, the issue
 
 GENEVA, May 21 (Reuters) - The United States and European
Union contested the status of Japan's mammoth postal, banking
and insurance conglomerate on Friday, saying the special
treatment of the group hurts private-sector competitors.
 Japan Post's status creates an unlevel playing field for
private competitors in the insurance, banking and express
delivery sectors, the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade
Organization, Michael Punke, and EU acting ambassador John
Clarke, told their Japanese counterpart, Shinichi Kitajima.
 ""We met jointly with Japan to underscore the deep level of
concern that we both share regarding Japan's preferential
treatment of Japan Post in light of Japan's national treatment
commitments under the WTO,"" Punke said in a statement.
 With assets of 300 trillion yen ($3.3 trillion), Japan Post
is a major player in Japan's banking and insurance markets as
well as in mail and courier services. As the holder of about a
third of Japanese Government Bonds it is also a key partner in
the government's debt management programmes.
 But its future has become highly political, with Japan's
Democratic Party-led government rolling back plans to privatise
the institution but set to endorse a proposal to double deposit
limits at its banking unit, raising the possibility of funds
draining from other banks but making it easier for Japan to fund
its growing debt.
 Both the United States and European Union are neutral on
whether Japan Post should be privatised, the U.S. statement
said.
 But they expressed disappointment that draft postal reform
legislation submitted to Japan's Diet does not address U.S. and
EU concerns about the preferential treatment that Japan Post
currently receives compared to private-sector companies.
 They also said they were worried by proposals to allow Japan
Post's banking and insurance units to expand their operations
before a level playing field is established.
 One US and EU concern is that Japan Post's insurance
operations have preferential access to the postal network,
giving it an advantage over private financial companies.
 Japan gives full national treatment to foreign companies in
the insurance sector under WTO rules, and Japan Post's special
treatment could breach those commitments, they said.
 Japan Post's foreign competitors in the delivery sector
include United Parcel Service, FedEx, TNT and Deutsche Post.

its heavy sell-off scrambled to take off those trades, while
fears of currency intervention loomed over the market.
 In volatile trade, the Australian dollar jumped 2 percent

973,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2010 07:27AM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-German parliament approves euro aid package," * German contribution seen at around 148 billion euros
 * Merkel under fire domestically over euro zone policy

(Adds Merkel quote)
 By Madeline Chambers
 BERLIN, May 21 (Reuters) - Germany's parliament approved a
law on Friday allowing Europe's biggest economy to contribute to
a 750 billion euro ($940 billion) emergency debt package despite
broad public opposition to the move.
 A clear majority of lawmakers in the lower house backed the
bill. But, in a sign of domestic pressure piling on Chancellor
Angela Merkel, 10 members of her own centre-right coalition
either voted against it or abstained.
 The bill will allow Germany to contribute some 148 billion
euros in guarantees to the international package.
 Under fire at home for her leadership style in the euro zone
debt crisis and from European Union partners over Germany's solo
move against speculators this week, Merkel welcomed the vote.
 ""The governing parties gave a clear message to Europe, for
Europe and a clear signal towards a culture of more stability in
the euro zone,"" Merkel told a news conference with British Prime
Minister David Cameron.
 The upper house also passed the bill, leaving President
Horst Koehler to sign it into law. In the lower house, 319
lawmakers voted for the bill, 195 abstained and 73 voted against
-- mostly members of the socialist Left party.
 The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens abstained
as they wanted a firmer commitment on a financial transaction
tax to force the financial sector to bear more of the burden.
 In a move at least partly designed to assuage hostile public
opinion about bailouts for weaker euro zone states, Germany
shook markets this week by banning some speculative trades or
naked short sales -- irking EU peers, who were not consulted.
 
 MERKEL UNDER ATTACK
 SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel accused Merkel of losing all
credibility. ""You have no direction, you have no goal,"" he told
Merkel, adding her tactics had lost the confidence of Europe.
 To add to Merkel's woes, a survey for ZDF television showed
51 percent of Germans polled opposed the euro zone aid package
and 54 percent said Merkel was giving too little leadership.
 Faced with such stiff public opposition, Merkel and her
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble argue the unpopular package
is essential to protect the euro which has fallen roughly 5.5
percent against the dollar this month.
 ""We're doing this in our best national interests ... the
common European currency has been a huge benefit to Germany,""
Schaeuble said in an impassioned speech before the vote, arguing
almost two thirds of exports go to members of the euro zone. 
 ""Without the euro, we would have a much weaker economy, a
much weaker Germany,"" he said, adding Germany is still pushing
for tougher rules on euro zone deficits.
 Germans resent forking out for weaker eurozone members. They
fear a bulging deficit of their own and do not want to help
states that have been less rigorous in budget discipline.
 Voters in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia punished
Merkel's centre-right coalition in a regional vote earlier this
month that was overshadowed by a row over the debt crisis.
 And in a stinging attack, Horst Seehofer, head of Bavaria's
conservatives who share power with Merkel, told the Sueddeutsche
Zeitung daily: ""Sometimes I have to stop myself from tearing my
hair out.""
 He complained of a lack of clarity over the government's
plans on a financial transaction tax, adding: ""The public feels
mocked.""
 The overall aid package includes 440 billion euros in
guarantees from euro states plus 60 billion euros in a European
instrument and 250 billion euros from the IMF. It is on top of a
22.4 billion euro contribution from Germany to an international
rescue plan for debt-ridden Greece, approved just two weeks ago.

 * Seeking to shore up euro, guard against debt meltdown
 * Germany pushing for stricter compliance, penalties
 * ""Taskforce"" to draw up conclusions by October
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - EU finance ministers will on
Friday examine ways of toughening common budget rules as they
look to shore up the euro and guard against a debt meltdown,
with Germany pushing hard for quick and radical action.
 The first meeting of an economic ""taskforce"" put together by
EU President Herman Van Rompuy takes place against the backdrop
of an investor exodus from the euro that has seen the region's
signature asset lose 6 percent of its value this month.
 Berlin will emphasise the need for tight national compliance
with budget rules, as it tries to rally the rest of the euro
zone and EU behind its vision and stop differences undermining
the bloc's unity.
 Germany, whose leader Angela Merkel has led the calls for
tougher fiscal action, agreed on Thursday to work together with
France to solve Europe's debt crisis, patching up a public rift
between the euro zone's top two economies that had rattled
markets around the world.
 EU governments are trying to regain investors' confidence
after months of turmoil that have pushed many euro zone member
states' borrowing costs sky high, led to a 110 billion euro
bailout of Greece and the setting up a $1 trillion safety net to
try to prevent the contagion spreading.
 The debt crisis has provoked huge instability in the
11-year-old euro currency, shared by 16 countries, and led to
demands for EU states to work much harder on coordinating their
economic policies and bring their finances into check.
 Van Rompuy's taskforce, which will meet regularly over the
next six months, is looking at how to give much more teeth to
the EU's budget rules, known as the stability and growth pact,
to ensure that future crises can be prevented. 
 ""Urgent action is needed to correct weaknesses in procedures
and institutions, to reform the stability and growth pact and to
develop new policy tools,"" Germany said in a paper prepared for
the meeting of EU finance ministers.
 But the gathering, which starts at 1200 GMT, is unlikely to
produce immediate results as it is the first of a series of
discussions that will generate conclusions for a summit of
European Union leaders to be held in October.
 ""This is only the beginning of the discussions, there will
be another meeting in June, we want to see what the issues are,
what questions to ask ourselves,"" one EU diplomat said.
 
 LONG-TERM GOALS
 The brainstorming will be based on last week's proposals
from the executive European Commission [ID:nLDE64B20P], which
said EU ministers should review each others' budget drafts
before they are voted into law by national parliaments to detect
potentially worrying trends early in the process.
 The Commission also proposed that countries that do not try
to reach budget balance or surplus despite good growth should
have to make a safety ""deposit"" and that penalties for
repeatedly missing fiscal targets should be more immediate.
 It suggested the flow of EU money to any of the bloc's 27
members could be suspended if fiscal discipline was lax and
called for governments to set deficit targets in a way that
would keep debt on a declining path. 
 The EU executive also wants countries to pay more attention
to competitiveness, calling for a more formalised scrutiny of
indicators that point to it. Greece, Spain and Portugal
particularly are seen to lag in competitiveness measures.
 These proposals received positive feedback from EU finance
ministers at a meeting last Tuesday. 
 
 FRANCO-GERMAN AXIS?
 But the EU's biggest economy Germany, where public opinion
is strongly opposed to helping euro zone countries that have
long disregarded EU budget rules, wants to go much further.
 Berlin called for all euro zone countries to incorporate EU
budget rules, under which deficits cannot exceed 3 percent of
GDP and debt should not be higher than 60 percent of GDP, into
national legislation, effectively making compliance law.
 Germany already has such a rule limiting the size of its
debt enshrined in its constitution, a commitment that France on
Thursday pledged to match.
Like the Commission, Berlin also wants the flow of EU funds
to member states to depend on solid fiscal policy and for
penalties for missing consolidation targets to kick in faster. 
 But in line with earlier statements from Chancellor Merkel,
Germany also wants countries that ""seriously infringe"" on EU
budget rules to have their voting rights at EU meetings
suspended for at least one year.
 In a clear reference to Greece, which for years supplied
inaccurate statistics to hide the true extent of its deficit,
such suspension of voting rights would also apply to those who
manipulate official statistics, the paper said.
 Germany, where public opinion has been strongly angered by
the euro zone's 110 billion euro emergency loan package to
Greece after markets effectively refused to lend to Athens any
more, also said the euro zone must come up with a plan to let a
euro state default in an orderly way.
 ""This will create incentives for countries to pursue solid
fiscal policies, and for financial-market participants to lend
responsibly,"" the German paper said.

975,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2010 06:55AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-German recovery skids on euro zone debt slick," * Ifo business sentiment reading unexpectedly falls in May
 * GDP data shows recovery sluggish in Q1
 * PMI shows private sector growth slows in May
 
 By Paul Carrel
 BERLIN, May 21 (Reuters) - German business sentiment dipped
in May and private sector growth slowed as the euro zone debt
crisis darkened the outlook for Europe's largest economy.
 Fears that markets within the euro zone might collapse or
that the zone might even break up have brought a huge dose of
uncertainty into the prospects for business. But by exacerbating
a sharp fall in the euro, they are also boosting German exports'
competitiveness outside the single currency zone.
 ""We are seeing a tug of war between two factors,"" said
UniCredit economist Andreas Rees.
 ""On the one hand you have a weaker euro and strong growth in
Asia, which is positive. On the other hand, companies are facing
a huge amount of uncertainty due to the debt crisis.""
 The Munich-based Ifo think tank said on Friday its business
climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms,
slipped to 101.5 from 101.6 in April, bucking expectations for a
rise to 102.0. The fall was the first since February.
 Separate data showed the economy grew at a sluggish pace in
the first three months of this year and, while economists expect
a pick-up in the second quarter, they are concerned the euro
zone crisis may weigh on the recovery later this year.
 A purchasing managers' index (PMI) heightened the concerns,
showing Germany's private sector expansion slowed in May as the
crisis and a peak in inventory rebuilding put a brake on output
and order book growth.
 ""We expect growth of at least 1 percent for the current
quarter,"" said BHF Bank economist Uwe Angenendt. ""But it remains
to be seen whether growth will remain solid despite the debt
crisis.""
 Chancellor Angela Merkel rocked markets on Wednesday by
saying ""the euro is in danger"", and a move by Germany this week
to ban some speculative trading activities has also fed market
concerns about the future of the single European currency zone.
 A stampede out of the euro due to worries about the broad
economic impact of the debt crisis drove it to a four-year low
against the dollar this week -- representing a fall of around 13
percent since the start of the year.
 
 EXPECTATIONS SLIP
 An Ifo index on current German business conditions edged up
to 99.4 from 99.3 in April, but an expectations index fell to
103.7 from 104.0 last month.
 The engineering group Siemens said the stronger dollar was
good for it, and Airbus parent EADS has also forecast a
long-term benefit from the battering the euro has taken.
 Germany exited its deepest post-war recession in the second
quarter of last year but the recovery slowed in the winter when
severe weather disrupted business activity.
 Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.2 percent in the first
quarter of this year, the Federal Statistics Office confirmed on
Friday, expanding for the fourth consecutive quarter.
 The economy was saved from a lapse back into contraction in
the January-March period by inventory building, which helped
outweigh shrinking private consumption and construction.
 Net trade subtracted 1.1 percentage points from GDP as a 6.1
percent surge in imports outweighed a 2.6 percent export rise.
 Recent economic indicators have beaten forecasts and pointed
to a renewed pick-up. Industrial output and orders surged in
March, while exports rose at their fastest rate in nearly 18
years, surpassing even the most optimistic predictions.
 ""The latest industry data suggest we will see strong growth
in the spring,"" said Alexander Koch, another UniCredit
economist. ""Positive news also comes from the strong rise in
imports: Many of these feed into production and exports.""
 However, the weaker PMI reading raised concerns about the
economic outlook beyond the second quarter.
 A flash estimate of the Markit composite PMI index, which
surveys the service and manufacturing sectors, fell to 55.5 from
59.3 in April, but remained above the key 50 mark separating
contraction from expansion.
 ""It is quite worrying -- this is the first time we have seen
the debt crisis have an impact on economic growth,"" said Chris
Williamson, chief economist at the data compiler.
 ""Headlines about the collapse of the euro are definitely
causing some uncertainty among consumers... what is good is that
it is not yet affecting global trade.""

 * Intervention fears heighten risk aversion
 * Australian dollar rises sharply, trims steep losses
 (Adds comment, details, updates prices)
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on Friday
as investors wary of holding too many short positions following
its heavy sell-off scrambled to take off those trades and fears
of currency intervention rose.
 In volatile trade, the Australian dollar jumped, paring
losses after its steep fall this week, on chatter that
Australia's central bank may intervene to support the bruised
currency. The RBA said it does not comment on market movements.
 A stampede out of the euro due to worries about the broad
economic impact of the euro zone debt crisis drove the euro to a
four-year low versus the dollar this week and has pushed net
short positions in the European currency to a record high.
 Analysts say that with risk aversion haunting the market,
investors are realising the dangers both of holding too many or
too few euros, particularly given speculation that authorities
may prop up the euro.
 ""The market has a clear view that the euro will be trending
lower, but by holding that position you are vulnerable to any
possibility of intervention,"" said Daragh Maher, senior currency
analyst at Credit Agricole CIB, adding that such fears had
extended the euro's short squeeze in past days.
 ""The intervention threat doesn't have to feel realistic,
when the market is an extreme position, even just a muttering
can cause a reaction.""
 The euro has fallen roughly 6 percent so far this month, and
its steep decline has cranked up speculation that European
officials may be concerned about the euro's level.
 Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday he
did not see the need to take immediate action to halt the euro's
decline..
 However, speaking in Tokyo, he said he discussed the common
currency's rapid plunge with the Japanese finance minister.
 On Friday, the euro climbed as high as $1.2673 on electronic
trading platform EBS in early trade, before pulling back to
$1.2545 by 0921 GMT, up 0.6 percent on the day. 
 The euro tumbled as low as $1.2143 earlier this week after
Germany banned naked short selling in some securities, fuelling
speculation about other possible market regulations.
 It is poised to end the week 1.5 percent higher against the
dollar, following five consecutive weeks of losses.
 
 AUSSIE GAINS
 Analysts said that heightened fears about risk had prompted
a rush to square positions -- long and short -- in currencies
which are high risk or less liquid.
""Risk aversion has risen so rapidly that in order to protect
their books, investors are just closing positions and
repatriating capital,"" said Carl Hammer, currency strategist at
SEB in Stockholm, adding: ""It's a snowball effect.""
Risk aversion shrivelled up liquidity as investors clamour
for dollars, which was resulting in choppy trade and aggravated
currency movements.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro traded 0.5 percent higher
at 1.4430, having recovered sharply from a slide to an all-time
low of 1.3995 francs earlier in the week.
 The Australian dollar rose 2 percent against the U.S. dollar
to $0.8318, pulling back from $0.8085 hit on Thursday, its
weakest since July 2009.
 It jumped as much as 5 percent versus the yen to 75.53 yen,
pulling back from a slide to a 10-month low near 71.90 yen in
early Asian trade.
 The yen was broadly weaker, stung by the unwind in short
positions in higher-risk currencies. The dollar rose 0.6 percent
to 90.12 yen, while the euro rose 1.8 percent against the yen to
113.14 yen.

currency
 * Insurers face lack of investment opportunities
 * Overseas investors may find it tougher to buy in
 By Kelvin Soh
 HONG KONG, May 21 (Reuters) - Insurers are lining up
launches of yuan-denominated policies in Hong Kong to tap
investor expectations of a rising yuan, marking another step in
the Chinese currency's trek towards globalisation.
 While the move could provide a long-term growth opportunity
for insurers active in Hong Kong, including American
International Assurance, a unit of AIG, and Canada's Manulife,
it brings severe asset-liability mismatch headaches to the
companies.
 It also raises questions whether insurance should be used
as a vehicle for speculation.
 This month, HSBC's insurance arm launched its first product
denominated in yuan, also known as the renminbi, in the former
British colony, setting the stage for others to begin selling
similar products.
 ""Many clients are buying in anticipation of an appreciation
of the renminbi, and we do expect similar products to appear in
the market over time,"" said Bruno Lee, HSBC's head of wealth
management in Asia.
 Hong Kong has become the test-bed for many of Beijing's
experiments with the yuan as it takes small steps towards its
ultimate aim of standing alongside the greenback as one of the
world's preferred reserve currencies.
 For many buyers, the prospect of currency appreciation
appears to be foremost on their minds. Most people now believe
China will allow its currency to start appreciating again by
the end of the year, following a two-year hiatus in which it
has remained steady against the U.S. dollar.
 The yuan policies would be a new product offering for
insurers in the competitive Hong Kong market, where insurance
premiums make up almost 10 percent of the territory's GDP,
compared to under 3 percent in China.
 LACK OF INVESTMENT OPTIONS
 The biggest downside, and potential roadblock, to the
development of new products, is the lack of investment options
for yuan holders, a reality that could leave insurers with
piles of the currency collected as premiums and nowhere to
invest it.
 Yuan investment options are highly limited for most
foreigners at present, as Chinese stock and debt markets are
now closed to them.
 Roger Steel, chief executive of Canadian insurer Sun Life
Financial's Hong Kong branch, said his company is examining how
best to meet customer demand for these products ""given the
relative scarcity of yuan investment opportunities.""
 Some are trying to get Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investor (QFII) status, which allows major non-Chinese
investors to buy Chinese 'A' shares listed in Shanghai and
Shenzhen.
 Only 95 firms have such status at present, including major
institutions such as HSBC, Singapore's DBS, Manulife and ING
Bank.
 Investors who live outside of Hong Kong and want a piece of
the yuan insurance pie may be unable to get it as most insurers
will probably limit such policies due to the relative scarcity
of yuan-denominated investment products.
 ""We're currently marketing the yuan insurance product only
to those living in Hong Kong,"" said HSBC's Lee. ""There're
limits on how much we can invest in China, and once we hit
that, we can't take any more money in.""
 Another option is to work with Chinese life insurance
titans such as China Life and Ping An, but they have little
interest in taking their products outside of China, content
with their home market's own breakneck growth.
 ""China insurance is still a huge growth story,"" said Yang
Jianhai, an analyst with Essence Securities in Shanghai.
""Management at Chinese insurers have enough on their plate
right now dealing with domestic growth, and I don't see them
moving overseas anytime soon.""
 A bank sales agent working at an HSBC branch in Hong Kong
who gave his name only as Fok said he had received many
enquiries about the new yuan insurance product, but most were
concerned about the long lock-in period.
 ""This (yuan insurance product) is only for very risk-averse
long-term investors,"" he said. ""If you're hoping to make a
quick buck, just go to Shenzhen and open a bank account there.
They have higher interest rates in China anyway.""

980,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2010 04:59AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Euro zone private sector unchecked by debt crisis," * Services PMI highest since August 2007
 * Pace of growth in manufacturing sector slows
 * Composite employment index highest since June 2008
 
 (Adds market reaction, analyst comments)
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro zone economy has so far
shrugged off the region's debt crisis, with the dominant
services sector growing at its fastest pace in nearly three
years this month, a survey showed on Friday.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from
hotels to banks, rose to 56.0 in May from 55.6 in April, its
highest reading since August 2007.
 That marks the ninth month the index for the services sector
was above the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction and
was considerably above a Reuters poll consensus of 55.5.
 Official data from the euro zone has until now also shown
little effect on the real economy from the debt crisis.
 The services new business index slipped a point from April,
however, although still remaining comfortably above the 50 mark.
 However, the euro zone manufacturing sector, which drove a
large part of the economy's return to growth in the third
quarter of last year, saw the pace of growth slow from last
month's near four-year high.
 The flash manufacturing index dropped to 55.9 in May from
57.6 in April, way off forecasts for 57.5, while the output
index sank to 56.7 this month, from 61.2 in April which was the
the highest since June 2000.
 ""All the indications are that these PMI numbers are
indicating an economy which is running at a fairly solid rate of
growth despite all the concerns that are surrounding the euro
zone economy as a result of the market fall out,"" said Peter
Dixon at Commerzbank.
 Markets shrugged off the data.
 But the composite index, made up from the services and
manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,
fell to 56.2 this month from 57.3 in April, missing expectations
for 57.0.
 While second quarter performance for the major euro zone
economies is likely to be good, many analysts are concerned
about a slowdown in the second half of this year.
 ""Today's data strengthen our belief that growth momentum
will slow down in the second half of the year. All in all, we
still see some upside risks to our GDP forecast of 0.5 percent
quarter on quarter for Q2, but this is mostly related to the
strength of the rebound in construction activity after the
winter slump,"" said Marco Valli at UniCredit.
 ""Underlying momentum remains soft and will probably weaken
going forward."" 
 The euro zone economy escaped from its worst post-war
recession in the third quarter of last year. Preliminary data
last week showed the economy grew a paltry 0.2 percent between
January and March after remaining flat in the final three months
of 2009.
 It is seen growing 0.5 percent in the current quarter and
then 0.4 percent in the following two quarters.
 
 WEAK EURO HELPS EXPORTS
 Earlier flash PMIs showed the pace of growth in Germany's
manufacturing industries slowed from last month's record high
while its service sector also grew at a slower rate.
 But neighbouring France saw its services segment grow at a
rate not seen since August 2006 although its manufacturing
sector expanded at a slower pace than April's near four-year
high.
 The bloc's manufacturing sector was boosted by a tumbling
euro, which hit a four-year low on Wednesday on sustained
concerns about the unity of the euro zone.
 The new export orders index remained near March's 10-year
high at 58.6, just down from April's 58.7.
 The weak euro and rising fuel costs meant the service sector
input price index was above 50 for the sixth month but firms
were unable to pass these higher costs on, with the output price
index dropping to 47.5 from April's 48.3.
 Data released on Tuesday showed inflation in the 16-nation
bloc was at 1.5 percent in April, well below the European
Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling.
 Policymakers will get some cheer from the composite
employment index which rose to 50.4 this month, the first time
it has been above 50 since June 2008. Unemployment in the bloc
was at 9.6 percent in March, unchanged from February.

 LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - European stocks fell again on
Friday despite German approval of a euro zone rescue package, as
markets remained unconvinced the aid would resolve the debt
crisis.
 The euro, however, found support from short covering.
 Wall Street was also set to open lower, after plunging
nearly 4 percent in the previous session.

tackling the crisis.
 European finance ministers were meeting later on Friday to
discuss changes to budget rules to prevent another Greek-style
debt crisis.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
was down 2.2 percent, extending sharp falls over the previous
two sessions after Germany's decision to ban naked short selling
on some assets raised fears about a lack of coordination between
European policymakers. The UK's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> slipped below
the key 5,000 mark for the first time since November 2009.
 ""Valuations have cheapened, but the underlying fundamental

 ""The lack of political cohesion within the euro zone is
becoming more apparent by the day and this can only undermine
risk appetite and conviction in the longer-term outlook for

 FINANCIALS HAMMERED
 Energy shares were among the biggest losers on concerns that
any setback to economic growth would hit demand for oil as the
oil price fell towards $70 a barrel. [O/R] Financial stocks also
took a hammering following Thursday's approval by the U.S.
Senate of a sweeping Wall Street reform bill [ID:nN20244272].
 Earlier in Japan, the Nikkei <.N225> closed down 2.5 percent
and lost 6.5 percent on the week, its biggest weekly drop in

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro held broad gains on
Friday, after investors wary of holding too many short positions
following its heavy sell-off scrambled to take off those trades
as fears of currency intervention rose.
 In volatile trade, the Australian dollar jumped, paring
losses after its steep fall this week, on chatter that
Australia's central bank may intervene to support the bruised
currency. The RBA said it does not comment on market movements.
 A stampede out of the euro due to worries about the broad
economic impact of the euro zone debt crisis drove the euro to a
four-year low against the dollar this week and has pushed net
short positions in the single European currency to a record
high.
 Analysts say that with risk aversion haunting the market,
investors are realising the dangers both of holding too many or
too few euros, particularly given speculation that authorities
may prop up the euro.
 ""The market has a clear view that the euro will be trending
lower, but by holding that position you are vulnerable to any
possibility of intervention,"" said Daragh Maher, senior currency
analyst at Credit Agricole CIB, adding that such fears had
extended the euro's short squeeze in past days.
 ""The intervention threat doesn't have to feel realistic,
when the market is an extreme position, even just a muttering
can cause a reaction.""
 The euro has fallen roughly 6 percent so far this month, and
its steep decline has cranked up speculation that European
officials may be concerned about the euro's level.
 Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday he
did not see the need to take immediate action to halt the euro's
decline..
 On Friday, the euro climbed as high as $1.2673 on electronic
trading platform in early trade, before pulling back to $1.2500
by 0800 GMT.
 
 AUSSIE GAINS
 The single European currency has recovered since it tumbled
as low as $1.2143 earlier this week after Germany banned naked
short selling in some securities fuelled speculation of the
possibility of additional market regulations.
Market participants in Europe said liquidity was extremely
thin, aggravating movements.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was little changed on the
day at 1.4375, having recovered sharply from a slide to an all
time low of 1.3995 francs earlier in the week.
 The euro rose 1 percent against the yen to 112.20 yen.
 The Australian dollar rose 1 percent against the U.S. dollar
to $0.8235, pulling back from $0.8085 hit on Thursday, its
weakest since July 2009.
 It jumped as much as 5 percent versus the yen to 75.53 yen,
pulling back from a slide to a 10-month low near 71.90 yen in
early Asian trade.
 The yen was broadly weaker, stung by the unwind in short
positions in higher-risk currencies. The dollar rose 0.3 percent
to 89.90 yen.

 * Pace of growth in manufacturing sector slows
 * Composite employment index highest since June 2008
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro zone's dominant service
sector grew at its fastest pace in nearly three years this month
but the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector eased, a
survey showed on Friday.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
made up of surveys of around 2,000 businesses ranging from
hotels to banks, rose to 56.0 in May from 55.6 in April, its
highest reading since August 2007.
 That marks the ninth month the index for the services sector
was above the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction and
was considerably above a Reuters poll consensus of 55.5.
 The services new business index slipped a point from April,
however, although still remaining comfortably above the 50 mark.
 The euro zone manufacturing sector, which drove a large part
of the economy's return to growth in the third quarter of last
year, saw the pace of growth slow from last month's near
four-year high.
 The flash manufacturing index dropped to 55.9 in May from
57.6 in April, way off forecasts for 57.5, while the output
index sank to 56.7 this month, from 61.2 in April which was the
the highest since June 2000.
 The composite index, made up from the services and
manufacturing sectors and often used to predict overall growth,
fell to 56.2 this month from 57.3 in April, missing expectations
for 57.0.
 ""The flash PMI highlights the growing fragility of the euro
zone recovery. Although remaining consistent with GDP rising at
a quarterly rate of 0.5-0.6 percent, worrying signs of weakness
have appeared,"" said Chris Williamson at data provider Markit.
 The euro zone economy escaped from its worst post-war
recession in the third quarter of last year. Preliminary data
last week showed the economy grew a paltry 0.2 percent between
January and March after remaining flat in the final three months
of 2009.
 It is seen growing 0.5 percent in the current quarter and
then 0.4 percent in the following two quarters.
 
 WEAK EURO HELPS EXPORTS
 Earlier flash PMIs showed the pace of growth in Germany's
manufacturing industries slowed from last month's record high
while its service sector also grew at a slower rate.
 But neighbouring France saw its services segment grow at a
rate not seen since August 2006 although its manufacturing
sector expanded at a slower pace than April's near four-year
high.
 The bloc's manufacturing sector was boosted by a tumbling
euro, which hit a four-year low on Wednesday on sustained
concerns about the unity of the euro zone.
 The new export orders index remained near March's 10-year
high at 58.6, just down from April's 58.7.
 The weak euro and rising fuel costs meant the service sector
input price index was above 50 for the sixth month but firms
were unable to pass these higher costs on, with the output price
index dropping to 47.5 from April's 48.3.
 ""Weak demand and intense competition continued to drag down
prices,"" Williamson said.
 Data released on Tuesday showed inflation in the 16-nation
bloc was at 1.5 percent in April, well below the European
Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling.
 Policymakers will get some cheer from the composite
employment index which rose to 50.4 this month, the first time
it has been above 50 since June 2008. Unemployment in the bloc
was at 9.6 percent in March, unchanged from February.

 * Japanese margin traders active buyers of Aussie/yen
 * Low market liquidity exacerbates moves
 * Euro up about 2 pct on week, Aussie slides 6 pct
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro surged for a third
straight day on Friday as market players unwound more short
positions in the single currency, while the battered Australian
dollar jumped on a wave of buying by investors and Japanese
retail traders.
 After slumping to a four-year low earlier this week, the
euro has rallied back on a flurry of short-covering by hedge
funds and other short-term traders as well as fund repatriation
by European investors.
 The fears about the euro zone's future have rattled
investors all month and sparked some of the worst currency
market volatility this week since the severe market swings in
the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse.
 Investors have scrambled to close out positions across
markets, resulting in big short-covering in the euro and heavy
selling of the higher-yielding Australian dollar that had been
used as a proxy for Asia's stronger economic performance.
 The rush for the exits has spooked other market players from
trading actively, resulting in choppy and illiquid markets and
more intraday turbulence. Implied volatility across currencies
and stocks has shot higher.
 ""What has been happening over the past couple of days is
position unwinding on a global scale,"" said Akira Hoshino, chief
manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange
trading department. ""The euro, dollar and the yen have all
become currencies used in the carry trade, so money is returning
back to those currencies.""
 The euro climbed 1 percent to $1.2612, pulling away from a
four-year trough of $1.2143 hit earlier in the week.
 The euro rose roughly 1.5 percent versus the yen to 113.62
yen, rebounding from an 8-½ year low of 109.47 struck the
previous day. The euro also rallied more than 1 percent against
the Swiss franc on stop-loss buying.
 ""The impact spilled over into various places and led to
moves to cut losses in euro/Swiss franc, euro/Aussie or
sterling/Aussie,"" said Minoru Shioiri, chief FX trading manager
at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
 In a sign that some investors were unwinding euro carry
trades, the euro has surged nearly 8 percent over the past three
days against the Australian dollar.
 Shorting the euro against the Aussie had been one of the
more popular trades in currencies for macro hedge funds making
bets on relative economic performance, and hedge funds were seen
as the main culprits unwinding those positions, traders said.
 AUSSIE RALLYS
 Even as the euro surged against the dollar and the yen, the
single currency gave back some ground against the Australian
dollar, which spiked higher in a volatile session.
 The Australian dollar slid initially on loss-cut selling
against the yen by Japanese retail margin traders, but later
rebounded sharply.
 After the initial flurry of loss-cut selling abated, the
margin traders were detected actively buying the Australian
dollar on dips, traders said.
 ""Retail investors are buying Aussie/yen quite a bit,"" said a
trader for a major Japanese brokerage house.
 ""It's their typical trading pattern. They see how far the
Aussie has fallen and are buying, seemingly without any other
particular reason,"" the trader added.
 The Australian dollar slumped to a 10-month low near 71.90
yen in early Asian trading on Friday but later jumped about 5
percent from that low to a high near 75.50 yen.
 The Aussie was up 2 percent at $0.8302 after surging back to
$0.8373. The move up was on lower volumes on Reuters Matching
compared with the past few days, suggesting that illiquid
markets were contributing to the outsized moves.
 The Aussie was still down 6 percent on the week, but a
weekly close above the $0.8110 level -- the 38.2 percent
retracement of the rise from the 2008 lows to the 2009 peak --
would help give it near-term support.
 ""Volatility is just very high,"" said Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi's Hoshino.
 Market players said the Australian dollar was lifted partly
by talk that the Reserve Bank of Australia was intervening in
the market to support the Australian dollar. The RBA said that
it did not comment on market moves.
 The RBA intervenes when it perceives a lack of liquidity
causing disorderly moves as in late 2008, but traders did not
think conditions had yet become bad enough for them to step in.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 90.10 yen,
getting some support from dollar buying by Japanese importers,
market players said.
 The market showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan
fleshed out a new loan scheme aimed at encouraging commercial
banks to lend more to industries with growth potential.

 Beijing has said Chinese companies have for too long relied

 Many foreign companies have objected to Chinese rules aimed

986,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2010 01:36AM ET</span>",Chinese students press Locke on U.S. export controls," By Doug Palmer
 BEIJING - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, addressing
students at a top Chinese university on Friday, said the Obama
administration was moving to ease restrictions on exports of
high-technology goods to China.
 Locke, a Chinese-American and former state governor who is
well known in China, also brushed off the second suggestion this
week that he run for president.
 ""No, no, no. I have no interest,"" Locke said during a
question-and-answer session at Beijing's Tsinghua University, an
elite school for training engineers and scientists.
 Locke is leading a delegation of executives from 24 U.S.
companies on a clean energy trade mission that began on Monday in
Hong Kong.
 At each stop in China, he has faced questions about U.S.
restrictions on exporting sensitive technology to China, which
Chinese officials say are partly to blame for their huge trade
surplus with the United States.
 The vigorous questions from the university audience
underscored how much attention China gives the issue.
 China is also likely to press the issue next week when it
holds the Strategic and Economic Dialogue with senior U.S.
officials, including Locke.
 Locke told the students that the United States was moving to
loosen controls on many commonly available high-tech goods, while
boosting protections on the most sensitive technology with
military applications.
 Locke has criticised the current U.S. rules restricting
high-tech exports as an artefact of the Cold War and called for
their overhaul so that more countries can by American ""dual use""
equipment, which can have both military and civilian uses.
 Locke is a former governor of Washington state, home to
Microsoft, Boeing and other high-tech companies that have pushed
for reforms of U.S. export controls.
 But Locke also downplayed the effect that current controls
have on bilateral trade.
 ""What a lot of people don't realize is most of the goods that
are exported to China are not even subject to controls ... and
only in a few cases are things not allowed to be exported"" when
licences are sought, Locke said.
 That means China must ""export less"" and rely more on domestic
demand, while the United States needs to reduce its huge debt and
spend less on consumer goods, he said.
 Locke has raised his own concerns about Chinese government
procurement practices that frustrate many U.S. sales.
 He urged Chinese decision-makers in meetings on Thursday not
to automatically choose the lowest-cost provider for big wind
energy and other projects since higher-priced U.S. equipment is
often a better deal in the long run, a Commerce Department
official said.

 JAKARTA, May 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia will keep its crude
palm oil (CPO) export tax at 4.5 percent in June and maintain
its cocoa export tax at 10 percent, an official at the industry
ministry said on Friday.
 ""Average prices of CPO and cocoa have been relatively at
the same level compared with the last month, so we didn't see
any reasons to raise the export tax in June,"" said Faiz Achmad,
director of food industry at the industry ministry.
 Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, relies on
overseas markets, mainly China and India, to buy nearly 70
percent of its palm oil output.
 Exports of palm oil products in the first quarter rose 7
percent to 3.62 million tonnes against the same period last
year, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association.
 The export tax on crude palm oil is aimed at ensuring the
domestic requirement for cooking oil is met and to help reduce
volatility in domestic cooking oil prices.
 Ahmad said Indonesia would also keep the June export tax
unchanged on locally grown cocoa beans at 10 percent.
 The export tax, which came into effect in April, was part
of an effort to encourage the retention of fermented beans for
local refining. Fermentation is needed to enhance the cocoa
flavour.
 Indonesia is the world's third-largest cocoa producer after
Ivory Coast and Ghana and is also Asia's second-largest grinder
after Malaysia.

 SINGAPORE, May 21 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets slid on

 European shares were seen opening lower as well. Financial
spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 to open as much as

and France's CAC-40 1.1 percent weaker.
 Trading was choppy in foreign exchange markets as the euro

Australian dollar recovered from 10-month lows on talk of
central bank intervention.
 ""Investors are shifting toward cash as you can see from

 Japan's Nikkei average fell as much as 3.2 percent to

 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro inched up on Friday as a
bout of short-covering extended, while the Australian dollar was
struggling near 10-month lows hurt by a wave of long liquidation
by investors like hedge funds and Japanese margin traders.
 The yen  and the U.S. dollar were broadly higher as
sentiment towards riskier assets continued to suffer on mounting
worries about the euro zone which led investors to sell stocks
and commodities in droves. The yen and the greenback are
generally favoured when there is a spike in risk aversion.
 In Asian trade, the euro  firmed to $1.2540 from
$1.2507 late in New York on Thursday when it went as high as
$1.2598. It got a boost on Thursday, helped by its gains versus
the Swiss franc and speculation European monetary officials might
intervene to prop up the single currency.
 On the year, however, the euro is down over 12 percent
against the dollar. Despite Thursday's rise, sentiment on the
currency remains decidedly negative, with investors concerned
about a seeming lack of unity among euro zone leaders in
addressing the region's debt crisis. [ID:nSGE64J05H]
 More investors sold the high-yielding Australian dollar
, spurred by uncertainty over financial market regulation
after Germany banned some speculative trades and by worries that
the euro-zone debt problems would hurt global growth.
 The Australian dollar  was down at $0.8161, not far
from a 10-month low of $0.8071. It lost over 3 percent on
Thursday. The Aussie/yen  was down at 73.48 yen, near
levels not seen since last July as carry trades were unwound by
nervous margin traders.
 ""This is a classic shift in investor focus,"" said Greg Gibbs,
currency analyst at RBS. ""The Aussie has plunged through some key
technical levels and will find it tough to regain its feet. It
will be treated as one of the primary vehicles to express a
negative view on the European debt crisis and fears of sustained
contagion to the global banking system.""
 Indeed, Aussie/dollar 1-mth risk reversal 
shows an extreme bias for Aussie puts with markets now favouring
puts by over 6 percent. That partly reflected a growing need
among investors to hedge against further declines in the Aussie,
although option traders said liquidity conditions were very thin.
 The Aussie also slid on the euro , falling to its
lowest since Feb. 12, with the euro partly helped by talk of
suspected intervention by Swiss authorities in the euro/Swiss
 cross.
 Swiss National Bank Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan on Thursday
repeated a pledge to shield Switzerland from the euro zone debt
crisis that could potentially lead to deflation.
 The euro  was at 1.4401 Swiss francs, not far from
Thursday's high of 1.4455. Euro/yen  was up in volatile
trade, at 112.45 yen after having fallen by more than 1.5 percent

 * EU executive seeks closer economic policy coordination
 * Deal of tough reforms is possible but compromise feared
 
 (repeats, making no changes to content)
 By Timothy Heritage
 BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - Agreeing on a $1 trillion
safety net may prove the easy part of saving the euro now the
European Union's leaders are turning to the divisive issue of
tightening economic policy coordination.
 The European Commission wants to reinforce economic
surveillance and budget discipline to strengthen the euro zone
and prevent a repeat of Greece's debt crisis in any of the other
15 countries that use the single currency.
 But a battle is looming over the proposals even before the
first meeting on Friday of a task force set up by EU President
Herman Van Rompuy to come up with ideas on how to toughen EU
budget rules and improve policy coordination.
 A call by the Commission to see governments' budget plans
before they are submitted to national parliaments has caused
some countries to fear their sovereignty is threatened.
 Divisions have also been exposed by a German ban this week
on short-selling, despite a vow by Berlin and Paris on Thursday
to work together on the euro zone crisis.
 Concerns are growing that the EU, which represents more than
500 million people, will miss the best chance in years to agree
on far-reaching reforms to stabilise the euro.
 ""The EU will have to cobble something together by the end of
this year but it is an open question whether it will be
meaningful or not,"" said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for
European Policy Studies think tank.
 He said the 27 member states could find it is much harder to
secure a deal on closer economic surveillance in talks that will
last several months than it was to reach agreement on the 750
billion euro safety under pressure from financial markets.
 ""If you're in a situation where you have months to agree and
everyone wants it be as perfect as possible on paper, but in
reality containing as few constraints as possible on member
states, the situation is completely different,"" Gros said.
 He said a meaningful deal might also be harder to come by if
the euro recovers after falls in recent weeks and the 16-country
euro zone's sovereign debt crisis eases, reducing pressure on EU
leaders to carry out far-reaching reforms.
 
 GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES 
 The euro has enjoyed many successful years in the 11 years
since its creation but it has been undermined by the debt crisis
in Greece, which has won a 110-billion-euro ($136.6 billion)
rescue package from the EU and International Monetary Fund.
 The European Commission wants to tighten mutual fiscal
supervision to ensure often-flouted rules on budget deficits and
debt limits are respected, and wants faster and tougher
sanctions imposed on budget sinners.
 It also wants surveillance of the vast differences in
competitiveness between the euro zone countries beefed up.
 But some national leaders are wary of taking steps towards
greater economic integration. Doing so could be political risky
in countries where the global financial crisis has increased
nationalist sentiment. 
 There is also no appetite for treaty change to reinforce the
budget rules, after the EU spent almost a decade securing
agreement on the Lisbon treaty reforming its institutions.
 France and Germany have said the Commission proposals go in
the right direction, but they are likely to balk at giving
others any influence over their budgets.
 Germany and France also have different visions of the euro
zone's future. Berlin favours tough budget discipline, while
France puts more emphasis on close economic policy coordination
and boosting economic growth.
 ""Monetary union hinges on Germany, and on a political level
Germany can't do anything without working together with France.
They are the key decision makers in this,"" said Fabian Zuleeg,
chief economist at the European Policy Centre think tank.
 ""At the moment it's in the big countries that there are
questions but there will also be questions about how this will
apply to weaker performing countries. Are they willing to sign
up to something if it looks like it will have teeth? And if we
are talking about automatic sanctions, countries such as Spain,
Ireland and Portugal might have queries about it.""
 Sweden has also expressed reservations about some of the
proposals and they are unlikely to please Britain. But London
and Stockholm are not in the euro zone so would not feel the
impact of the planned reforms as extensively as others.
 
 MERKEL IN DIFFICULT POSITION
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in a particularly
difficult position because many Germans resent being Europe's
paymasters, bailing out other nations they regard as profligate.
 Any far-reaching reforms of the euro zone could face a
challenge in the German constitutional court. Even so, Germany
is widely expected to do what it takes to stabilise the euro.
 Some EU leaders see the debt crisis as a chance to finally
pursue the dream of closer economic union that was set out by
the founders of what became the EU. Such moves have not been
discussed so intensely by policymakers for years.
 But economic analysts say the EU leaders need to narrow the
gap between their rhetoric about a united and integrated Europe
and the harsh reality of national interests and politics if they
are to make much progress towards closer integration.
 ""The problem is that when countries signed up to the single
currency they were not made aware that it would require such
integration. Political elites need to start explaining why it
does,"" said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Centre for
European Reform in London.

 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Global stocks and commodities
sold off on Thursday as investors dumped risky assets and
rushed into safe-havens on fears fiscal tightening is on the
rise and will snuff the world's nascent recovery.
 U.S. stock indexes dropped 3.6 percent or more, with the
benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index now showing a correction.
The index is off 12 percent from its 2010 closing high in
April.
 At one point the euro fell to its lowest against the yen
since November 2001, hurt by seeming disunity among euro zone
leaders on how to address the region's debt crisis.
 But the euro later rebounded as investors who had bet
against the single currency were forced to buy back euros to
cut their losses in what is known as a ""short squeeze.""
 U.S. government debt prices soared in heavy trading as
investors sold liquid assets and snapped up safe-havens. Gold
prices dropped, but the losses in equity markets spurred demand
for the safe-haven metal.

 Fiscal tightening in debt-strapped developed countries will
slow growth and lower inflation across the world, which is
increasing selling pressure in financial markets, said Bill

 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday pressed Japan
to begin a ""credible"" fiscal program which includes a 5 percent
sales tax increase. French President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed

apprehension. Volatility reigned as a sense of instability
unleashed panicky selling across markets.
 Also driving anxiety were concerns over a proposed overhaul
of U.S. financial regulation, which critics say would reduce
banks' capacity to lend and broadly increase borrowing costs.

999,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2010 05:28PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Venezuela's Chavez vows more financial crackdown," * State has taken control of forex trading
 * 15 brokerages raided, 4 directors arrested
 * Chavez promises to fight capitalist ""mafia""
(Recasts with Chavez speech; adds details)
 By Andrew Cawthorne
 CARACAS, May 20 (Reuters) - President Hugo Chavez vowed on
Thursday to deepen a financial crackdown after raids on 15
brokerages and the arrest of four directors in the wake of the
state's takeover of foreign exchange trading.
 The socialist leader said this week's move to exclude
private money-changers and transfer the so-called ""parallel""
currency business to the Central Bank, had brought a typically
ferocious reaction from Venezuela's traditional elite.
 ""We're going to keep hitting them hard,"" Chavez said in a
speech on state TV. ""We will become more radical, the more
imperialism and its allies attack us.""
 With Venezuela's ""parallel"" market paralyzed, until the
central bank sets up its new system, economists and business
leaders have accused Chavez of bringing chaos to the OPEC
member nation's already recession-hit economy.
 Given restricted access to dollars at the official rates of
2.6 and 4.3 bolivars, more than half of imports had been
depending on the ""parallel"" market, where the local currency
had dived this year to more than 8.0 to the dollar.
 By taking over that ""parallel"" market, South America's
biggest oil exporter is now effectively setting up a third
controlled exchange rate, albeit within a band. Chavez said the
band would be near the 4.3 rate, though analysts and traders
had forecast around 5.0-7.0 bolivars.
 Angrily waving the front page of local business daily El
Mundo and quoting business leaders' criticism of him, Chavez
said the ""savage Venezuelan bourgeoise"" had launched a
concerted attack since Tuesday's currency announcements.
 Analysts say a new black market will inevitably spring up,
creating a fourth and much higher rate for the dollar, and
another devaluation may come next year.
 Since Tuesday's measures were announced, financial
officials have searched 15 institutions in Caracas, studying
documents, examining computers and quizzing staff.
 Four brokerage directors have been arrested.
 Chavez said the government was bringing down an old system
of ""fraud houses"" run by a ""mafia"". ""Nothing and nobody is
going to stop me, I guarantee you, Mr. Oligarchs,"" he said.
 Chavez accuses capitalist speculators of undermining the
bolivar and fueling one of the highest inflation rates in the
world. Critics blame him, however, for the country's economic
woes, saying a complex currency system distorted the market,
while socialist policies hobbled investment and production.
 Chavez rejected criticism of state currency board CADIVI,
saying it had released $11.8 billion to businesses so far this
year, compared to $10.3 billion in the same period of 2009.
 Analysts say the government must act swiftly during a
period of uncertainty until the new system is operating.
 ""Delays will only choke imports, with the corresponding
results of higher inflation, lower private demand, more severe
shortages and deeper contraction of economic activity,"" the
Royal Bank of Scotland said in a research note on Thursday.
 ""The erratic policy response and the authorities' track
record does not augur well for a fast resumption of a working
permuta (swap) FX market.""
 Venezuela's more than 90 brokerages had increasingly relied
on the exchange business -- via complex debt-swaps -- because
trade on the local stock exchange was minimal, sometimes less
in a day than the cost of a middle-class Caracas apartment.
 ""There is panic. Many firms have already started laying off
people. There is a witch-hunt taking place against the
brokerage houses, as if they are the only ones who are
responsible for what is happening,"" said one trader.
 Despite its oil, analysts predict Venezuela will be the
only Latin American nation with economic contraction in 2010.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Thursday, helped by its gains versus the Swiss franc
and speculation European monetary officials may intervene to
prop up the single currency.
 As the euro started to rise, investors who had bet against
the single currency were also forced to buy back euros to cut
their losses in what is known as a ""short squeeze.""
 ""The move seemed to have been led by the euro-franc and
dollar-franc crosses,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of
currency strategy, at Brown Brothers Harriman, in New York.
 ""The implied volatility....the large positions that have
been built up all point to a vulnerable market -- vulnerable to
a short squeeze. There have (also) been veiled threats of
stronger action (on the euro) but this will not change
sentiment very long.""
 In late afternoon trading, the euro rose 0.7 percent to
$1.2510, touching session peaks at $1.2598 on the EBS trading
platform and intra-day lows at $1.2296.
 A trader said there was a large euro order in the afternoon
session of more than $400 million at $1.2440, which propelled
the single currency higher. Markets then took out stop losses
after that $1.2440 level was hit.
 On the year, however, the euro was still down 12.6 percent
against the dollar.
 Despite Thursday's surge in the euro, sentiment on the
currency remains decidedly negative, with investors concerned
about a seeming lack of unity among euro zone leaders in
addressing the region's debt crisis.
 ""Unfortunately, there is no coordinated response to this
crisis from the European Union and this has hurt the euro,""
said Ron Simpson, director of currency research at Action
Economics in Tampa, Florida.
 The discord has been most apparent the last two days when
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday the euro is
in danger. ""Every one of us here can feel that the currency
crisis in the euro is the greatest challenge that Europe has
faced (in) decades,"" Merkel said.
 That was a statement that didn't sit well with French
Economy Minister Christine Lagarde, who said on Thursday she
does not agree with Merkel's view. ""I absolutely do not think
the euro is in danger. The euro is a solid and credible
currency.""
 INTERVENTION?
 The euro had recovered from four-year lows on Wednesday as
traders covered short positions on speculation Europe might act
to check its rapid fall. For now, market players see
intervention unlikely.
 Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday he
did not see a need to take immediate action to halt the euro's
decline. This was echoed by European Union Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia who said there was no need to
intervene.
 The euro also got a bid after Swiss National Bank Vice
Chairman Thomas Jordan repeated a pledge to shield Switzerland
from the euro zone debt crisis that could potentially lead to
deflation. ""Therefore (the SNB) is countering an excessive
appreciation of the Swiss franc decisively.""
 The euro last traded at 1.4392 Swiss francs, up 0.7 percent
on the day, after hitting highs of $1.4455. Traders said based
on the pair's price action, it seemed the SNB intervened in the
market to buy euros against the franc, but no one could confirm
it.
 Worries about the euro zone spooked investors in global
stock and commodity markets as well, fueling a surge in the yen
and U.S. dollar as safe havens. Japan and the United States
have economic problems of their own. But their relatively
stable financial systems and liquid currencies make them
attractive to investors fleeing risk in Europe.
 There was also a flight from currencies that benefit from
increased risk appetite such as the Australian, Canadian, and
New Zealand dollars.
 The dollar fell 2.2 against the yen to 89.62 yen. The
low-yielding Japanese currency also surged against the euro,
which plunged 1.6 percent to 112.03. At one point, the euro
slipped to the lowest against the yen since November, 2001 at
109.49, according to Reuters data.

 * Sarkozy says working with Merkel on Stability Pact
 * Cameron says in British interest to have strong euro

(Adds comments from Cameron paragraphs 8, 17)
 By Crispian Balmer
 PARIS, May 20 (Reuters) - France and Germany agree on key
economic policy-making, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on
Thursday, adding that the two nations were working on ways to
penalise euro zone states that failed to honour budget pledges.
 France was stunned earlier this week when Germany
unilaterally introduced a ban on speculative short-selling of
securities, with senior officials in Paris openly criticising
Berlin for failing to coordinate such a sensitive move.
 But Sarkozy denied that the two countries were at odds over
how to respond to the euro zone debt crisis, adding that he was
in almost daily contact with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
 ""I told Angela Merkel that there cannot be disagreements
between France and Germany on subjects of this importance,"" he
told reporters. ""We do not have disagreements together.""
 Sarkozy was speaking at a joint news conference with British
Prime Minister David Cameron, who was making his first foreign
trip since taking office last week and is due to meet Merkel in
Berlin on Friday.
 Cameron said Britain wanted the euro to be strong, but
reaffirmed that Britain would not participate in a multi-billion
euro rescue package drawn up earlier this month by EU nations.
 ""Let me be absolutely clear it is in Britain's interest that
the euro zone is a success,"" he said.
 ""Obviously as we are outside the euro zone, it is not the
same call on us in terms of financial support. It shouldn't be,
because we are not members of the euro,"" he added.
 
 SANG FROID
 Sarkozy replied pointedly that the euro was a success and
said people should take a more measured view of recent market
turmoil, sparked by fears of a possible Greek debt default, that
has seen the euro fall sharply against the dollar.
 ""There has been a lot of feverishness (in the markets) for
some time now and us heads of state and government have to
respond to this feverishness with sang froid,"" Sarkozy said.
 Furious at having to dig deep into its pocket to help
Greece, Germany wants to see sanctions imposed on euro zone
countries that in future fail to honour deficit commitments.
 Sarkozy said he had talked about the issue on Thursday with
Merkel, but questioned whether suggestions of slapping financial
penalties on budget laggards would only aggravate the problem.
 ""We need to think up more efficient sanctions. The
chancellor made some propositions. I myself proposed suspending
their voting rights (within the European Union),"" he added.
 ""There is total agreement between me and the chancellor on
the need to think about new sanctions,"" he said, adding that the
Stability Pact which underpins the euro currency needed to be
broadened and become more transparent and more efficient.
 ""Between now and June we will work on this with the (German)
chancellery,"" he said.
 France itself has singularly failed to balance its budget,
and, no doubt chastened by market chaos, Sarkozy announced
earlier on Thursday that tackling the deficit should be
enshrined in the constitution -- bringing Paris much closer to
Germany in its approach to state finances.
 Cameron stressed that Paris and London saw eye-to-eye on
many topics, including Afghanistan, and said the two capitals
had ""very much a shared agenda"" for G8 and G20 efforts to reform
the financial sector, including imposing levies on banks.

 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Global stocks and commodities
sold off on Thursday, knocking U.S. stocks down 10 percent from
this year's highs in April, on worries that fiscal tightening
is on the rise and will snuff the world's nascent recovery.
 U.S. oil prices suffered their biggest one-day loss in 13

sold liquid assets and snapped up safe-havens such as bonds.
 The 10 percent slide in the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500

 The sell-off initially was driven by fear that Europe's

Strauss-Kahn said the euro zone needed strong economic

they will break growth,"" he said, adding that the 3 percent of

(Recasts, adds comment, byline, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro on Thursday fell to
its lowest against the yen since November 2001 as investors
fretted about a seeming lack of unity among euro zone leaders
in addressing the region's debt crisis.
 Worries about the euro zone spooked investors in global
stock and commodity markets as well, fueling a surge in the yen
and U.S. dollar as safe havens. There was a flight from
currencies that benefit from increased risk appetite such as
the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand dollars.
 ""Every European Union member has a central banker and a
finance minister and all are opening their mouths. But
unfortunately, there is no coordinated response to this crisis
and this has hurt the euro,"" said Ron Simpson, director of
currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida.
 The discord has been most apparent the last two days when
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday that the euro
is in danger. ""Every one of us here can tell that the currency
crisis in the euro is the greatest challenge that Europe has
faced (in) decades,"" Merkel said. [ID:nLDE64I0EN].
 That was a statement that didn't sit well with French
Economy Minister Christine Lagarde, who said on Thursday she
does not agree with Merkel's view. ""I absolutely do not think
the euro is in danger, The euro is a solid and credible
currency."" [ID:nWEA3155].
 Japan and the United States have economic problems of their
own. But their relatively stable financial systems make the
dollar and yen attractive to investors fleeing risk in Europe.
 In early afternoon trading, the euro  rose 0.5
percent at $1.2490, touching session peaks at $1.2511 on EBS
trading platform and intra-day lows at $1.2296.
 A trader said there was a large euro order in the afternoon
session of more than $400 million at $1.2440, which propelled
the single currency higher. Markets then took out stop losses
after the $1.2440 level was hit.
 INTERVENTION UNLIKELY?
 The euro had recovered from four-year lows on Wednesday as
traders covered short positions on speculation European
monetary officials might act to check its rapid fall. For now,
market players see intervention unlikely.
 Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday he
did not see a need to take immediate action to halt the euro's
decline [ID:nTOE64I038]. This was echoed by European Union
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia who said there was no
need to intervene. [ID:nLDE64J0YZ]
 Action Economics' Simpson said despite concerns about the
euro, the single currency was able to hold above $1.2300 and
this he attributed to a less upbeat view on the U.S. economy.
 In fact, data showed on Thursday that the number of U.S.
workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance
unexpectedly rose last week for the first time since early
April. [ID:nN20268728]. The report added to the market's risk
aversion.
 ""U.S. economic data has not been as good as those in the
first quarter. That kind of kept the dollar under pressure
which is probably the reason why euro/dollar didn't collapse to
test the trend lows from (Wednesday),"" said Action's Simpson.
 The dollar was down around 1.9 percent against the yen
 at 89.88 yen. The low-yielding Japanese currency also
surged against the euro , which plunged 1.4 percent
to 112.30. At one point, the euro slipped to the lowest against
the yen since November, 2001, according to Reuters data.
 In other European news, the euro got a bid after Swiss
National Bank Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan said Switzerland can
cope with a stronger currency in the longer term though the SNB
is for now countering an excessive rise in the franc to prevent
deflation risks. [ID:nLAG006289]
 The euro  last traded at 1.4369 Swiss francs, up
0.6 percent on the day.
 The Australian dollar came under further heavy selling
pressure versus the U.S. dollar and the yen in particular. 
 The Aussie , traded down around 2.7 percent versus
the U.S. dollar at US$0.8248 after falling to a ninth-month low
at US$0.8153.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2010 12:43PM ET</span>",Germany seen risking WTO challenge over shortselling," * WTO rules allow limits to financial services access
 * But only for prudential or financial stability reasons
 
 GENEVA, May 20 (Reuters) - Germany's ban on speculative
short-selling of securities could be challenged at the World
Trade Organization if it is viewed as excessive, a European
think-tank specialising in trade issues said on Thursday.
 The European Centre for International Political Economy
(ECIPE) said the move could mean that Germany was flouting its
commitments in the WTO on market access in financial services.
 WTO rules focus on liberalisation rather than regulation,
but require that regulation treats all countries equally.
 Despite that, there is a large waiver -- known as the
""prudential carve-out"" -- that allows members to take special
measures to ensure the integrity and stability of their
financial systems.
 But Germany's ban on naked short-selling of euro-denominated
government bonds, sovereign CDs on those bonds and shares in
Germany's 10 leading financial institutions did not fall into
this category, ECIPE said in a media brief.
 ""The German ban is not a prudential regulation, which
typically aims at protecting depositors and protects financial
systems from excessive risk-taking,"" it said.
 ECIPE cited doubts about the move's scope for increasing
stability on the German market.
 It also said the ban had been imposed in the worst possible
way from the point of view of WTO rules -- a unilateral measure
without any consultation with other countries.
 ""In short, the ban is against the founding principles of the
WTO and the European Union -- to stop disguised or poorly
designed domestic regulations that restrict trade, worsen
economic crisis and spread it to neighbours,"" it said.
 A challenge to Germany would involve a dispute against the
European Union as a whole, since Brussels represents member
states on trade.
 Short selling is a trade that bets a price will fall. Naked
short selling is when a trader sells a financial instrument
without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can
be borrowed.
 The Brussels-based think-tank has built a reputation for
spotting the trade litigation implications of economic or
commercial moves. In November last year it revealed that China's
censorship of the Internet was open to challenge at the WTO,
although no formal challenge has yet surfaced.

* Recommend higher taxes and marketing regulations
 * Alcohol producers say they'll help curb harmful misuse
 
 (Adds statements by SABMiller, medical alliance)
 By Stephanie Nebehay
 GENEVA, May 20 (Reuters) - Health ministers agreed on
Thursday to try to curb binge drinking and other growing forms
of excessive alcohol use through higher taxes on alcoholic
drinks and tighter marketing regulations.
 The global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol was
adopted by consensus at the annual assembly of the World Health
Organisation (WHO).
 Its 10 main policy recommendations, drawn up after two years
of negotiation, are not binding but serve as guidance to WHO's
193 member states. 
 ""Alcohol contributes to accidents, mental health problems,
social problems and harms third parties,"" said Bernt Bull, a
senior advisor in Norway's health ministry. Nordic countries,
many of which already have tight restrictions on alcohol sales,
spearheaded the initiative at the United Nations agency.
 A relatively high excise tax on alcoholic beverages and
regulations limiting their availability was helping to reduce
alcohol-related diseases in Norway, he said.
 The WHO estimates that risks linked to alcohol cause 2.5
million deaths a year from heart and liver disease, road
accidents, suicides and various cancers -- 3.8 percent of all
deaths. It is the third leading risk factor for premature deaths
and disabilities worldwide.
 ""Alcohol is usually not perceived as a killer, though it
is,"" Shekhar Saxena, director of WHO's department of mental
health and substance abuse, told a news briefing.
 Despite growing abuse and youth drinking at an earlier age
in many countries, half of WHO members do not have a national
alcohol policy, according to WHO expert Vladimir Poznyak.
 ""The biggest changes might happen in those countries which
have no alcohol control institutions or regulatory framework for
alcohol consumption,"" he told reporters.
 
 SELF-REGULATION
 The Global Alcohol Producers Group noted the strategy
recognised the importance of self-regulation by industry in
helping to address alcohol abuse.
 Its members recognised ""the harmful effects of irresponsible
drinking patterns"" and would continue efforts to promote
self-regulation of advertising as well as curbs on drink driving
and illegal underage and excessive drinking, a statement said.
 Britain's Diageo, the world's largest alcoholic drinks
group, and Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and
maker of Budweiser, are among its members.
 In a separate statement, brewing giant SABMiller gave a
cautious welcome to the plan, but warned:
 ""SABMiller is unconvinced there is sufficient evidence to
support policy options such as minimum pricing and high excise
taxes that may result in unintended, negative public health
consequences which stem from the growth of the illicit alcohol
market.""
 The WTO strategy document says the harmful use of alcohol
has a serious effect on public health and is one of the main
risk factors for poor health globally.
 There is strong evidence that a low limit for blood alcohol
concentration (0.02 to 0.05 percent) is effective in reducing
drink-driving casualties, it says.
 It underlined the importance of a legal framework for
restricting the sale and serving of alcohol, a minimum age for
buying drinks and ""mandated health warnings"" on alcohol labels.
 Setting a minimum price per unit gram of alcohol has been
shown to reduce consumption and alcohol-related harm, it said.
 But overly tight restrictions on alcohol availability may
promote the development of a parallel illicit market, it warned.
 The Global Alcohol Policy Alliance -- a coalition of medical
professionals, researchers and non-governmental organisations --
welcomed the WHO decision as historic and ""long overdue"".
 ""The strategy highlights the effectiveness of focusing on
policies regarding pricing, availability and marketing of
alcohol,"" it said in statement.

 By Salah Sarrar
 TRIPOLI, May 20 (Reuters) - The United States and Libya
signed a trade agreement on Thursday underlining their switch
from decades-long hostility to lucrative business ties.
 U.S. companies lagged their European rivals in entering the
Libyan market after international sanctions on Tripoli were
lifted in 2004. Washington is now striving to catch up.
 Under the agreement, a joint council will be set up to
handle issues including market access and intellectual property,

World Trade Organisation (WTO), officials said.
 ""The importance of this agreement is to build trust,"" Libyan
Trade Minister Mohamed Hweji told Reuters.
 Christopher Wilson, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for
Europe and the Middle East, was in the Libyan capital to sign
the agreement.
 ""We want to see the numbers grow in terms of both trade and
investment,"" he told reporters. ""We are looking forward to
creating the best conditions to do that.""
 U.S. aircraft bombed oil exporter Libya in 1986, killing
more than 40 people. Washington accused Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi of supporting armed militants and trying to acquire
weapons of mass destruction.
 Relations were restored after Gaddafi renounced banned
weapons programmes and agreed to pay compensation to the
families of those killed in the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
 In 2003, the United States exported $200,000 worth of goods
to Libya and imported nothing. By 2009, exports to Libya had
surged to $666 million and imports to $1.9 billion.
 Diplomatic relations between Tripoli and Washington hit a
set-back earlier this year when a State Department official made
caustic comments about a speech in which Gaddafi had called for
a ""jihad"" against Switzerland.
 U.S. energy companies operating in Libya, including Exxon
Mobil and ConocoPhillips were warned their interests could
suffer as a result. The row was resolved when the State
Department official apologised.

 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell against major
currencies on Thursday, staying vulnerable on concerns other
European countries may announce regulations similar to
Germany's ban on naked short selling of some stocks and bonds.
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
were under heavy selling pressure as concern over policymakers'
response to the euro zone debt crisis fueled risk aversion,
leading to liquidation of long positions.
 The U.S. dollar got a safe haven bid against most
currencies but extended losses against the yen after data
showed the number of U.S. workers filing new applications for
unemployment insurance unexpectedly rose last week for the
first time since early April. [ID:nN20268728]. The report added
to the market's risk aversion, prompting unwinding of carry
trades financed with low cost yen.
 The euro stayed above a four-year low of $1.2143 hit on
Wednesday in response to the German ban, but traders remained
nervous similar moves may follow, while broader concerns about
euro zone debt problems further weighed on sentiment. It fell
to its lowest since November, 2001 against the yen.
 ""The euro has fallen victim to concerns about the lack of
unity in the EU to tackle the debt problems,"" said Michael
Malpede, chief market analyst at Easy Forex in Chicago. ""There
was a statement by (Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude) Juncker
that he didn't see the immediate need for intervention. I think
that's what spooked the market initially.""
 Almost midway through the New York session, the euro 
was down 0.7 percent at $1.2345 with the session peak at
$1.2437 and the session low at $1.2298.
 The euro recovered from four-year lows on Wednesday as

 On September 22, 2000, the ECB intervened to support the
euro with the help of its trading partners and the euro/dollar

GFT in a note to clients.
 Traders said there was a broad tendency to sell into
rallies, adding the euro has failed to get above $1.2440 on
three occasions this week.
 ""There are so many problems in Europe we are seeing
investors move into the safety of the yen, out of the euro, and

 SWISS FRANC

remained down on the day after Swiss National Bank Vice
Chairman Thomas Jordan said Switzerland can cope with a
stronger currency in the longer term though the SNB is for now
countering an excessive rise in the franc to prevent deflation
risks. [ID:nLAG006289]
 The euro  last traded at 1.4254 Swiss francs, down
0.3 percent on the day.
 The Australian dollar came under further heavy selling
pressure versus the U.S. dollar and the yen in particular.
""The Australian dollar had got way overvalued - it was priced
almost for perfection and was always vulnerable to a sharp
correction despite strong economic fundamentals,"" BTMU's
Hardman said.
 The Aussie , traded down around 3.5 percent versus
the U.S. dollar at $0.8183 after falling to a ninth-month low,
according to Reuters data. It was on track for its biggest
weekly fall since October, 2008, according to Reuters data.
 The Australian dollar is classed as a high-yielder where
domestic Australian interest rates are higher than its trading
partners and even most other nations. While rates are high in a
bid to stem local demand they are also a measure of risk and
any expectations of a slowdown in global growth hurts the
aussie immediately.
 The U.S. dollar rose 0.2 percent versus a currency basket

 * Says currency intervention carries inflation risks
 * Says Swiss recovery ongoing, euro zone crisis a risk
 
(Releads with fresh Jordan comment)
 By Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, May 20 (Reuters) - Central bank intervention has
stopped the Swiss franc rising excessively against the euro,
though the country can cope with a stronger currency in the long
term, the bank's vice chairman said on Thursday.
 ""Through the financial crisis there was big pressure on the
Swiss franc. The franc appreciated, but the central bank acted
against this upwards pressure so that there wasn't an excessive
appreciation,"" Thomas Jordan said at a business event.
 Still, current monetary policy was too expansive for the
longer term as the Swiss National Bank's currency interventions
carried the risk of fuelling inflation, he said.
 The Swiss economy and its exporters were recovering well, a
trend that also pointed to higher inflation risks. But a
worsening of the debt crisis in the euro zone could usher in
another recession and increase the risk of deflation, Jordan
said.
 ""The national bank must undertake a balancing act between
these two opposing risks,"" he said.
 The SNB's main goal was to secure medium- to long-term price
stability, though it had enough flexibility to respond to events
on the financial or currency markets.
 The SNB cut its 3-month LIBOR target to a rock-bottom 0.25
percent in March 2009 and also began intervening in the foreign
exchange market to combat Switzerland's worst recession in
decades.
 The central bank stepped up its interventions in recent
weeks as the single currency came under heavy pressure due to
the euro zone debt crisis.
 Jordan repeated a pledge from the central bank to shield the
Alpine economy from fallout from the euro zone, which could lead
to deflation in Switzerland. ""Therefore it (the SNB) is
countering an excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc
decisively.""
 The franc pared some of its earlier gains after Jordan's
comments, trading at 1.4246 per euro by 1639 GMT.
 
 CHALLENGES
 The SNB will review monetary policy on June 17, when markets
widely expect the central bank to keep rates on hold and stick
with currency interventions.
 Switzerland exited recession last summer and its economy has
since performed better than many countries in the euro zone.
 Despite the SNB's efforts the franc surged to an all-time
high of about 1.40 per euro on Wednesday before dropping back
sharply.
 Jordan said exporters had coped comparatively well so far,
adding that global demand and not the exchange rate were key to
their success.
 ""An appreciation of the Swiss franc does not have to be a
problem per se,"" Jordan said.
 In the longer term, the stronger franc had forced Swiss
exporters to improve their competitiveness and helped to keep
interest rates low, he said.
 But speculative bubbles or a crisis of confidence, leading
to an overshooting, could harm the economy.
 Several surveys showed on Thursday that sectors such as
tourism and manufacturers were feeling the pressure from the
strong currency.[ID:nLDE64J10A]
 But overall, economic indicators had been pointing to a
robust recovery ahead.
Jordan repeated the central bank's 2010 growth forecast from
March of around 1.5 percent, saying exports showed a positive
trend while consumer spending also supported growth.
 But should the central bank tighten too late the economy
could overheat.
 At the same time, however, the euro zone crisis remained a
significant downside risk, so Switzerland has a ""strong
interest"" in the EU aid package working out well.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2010 10:15AM ET</span>",WTO's Lamy sees trade pact boosting green goods," * Doha deal to give environmental goods special treatment
 * Countries will benefit by opening to environmental goods
 
 By John Acher
 COPENHAGEN, May 20 (Reuters) - Talks on freeing up commerce
in environmental goods and services, which will have special
treatment in a new global trade pact, are making progress, the
head of the World Trade Organisation said on Thursday.
 WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said countries were
jostling for position in the sector, whose importance meant the
talks went beyond increasing market access as in other areas.
 ""There has to be a premium for environmental goods and
services, a bit like agriculture,"" Lamy told a news conference
before meeting Danish parliamentarians.
 Lamy said it was a complex process to agree the list of
environmental goods that would enjoy special access, but it was
moving ahead.
 ""If I have a competitive advantage in bicycles, I will make
sure that bicycles are on the list,"" he said. ""If I have a
competitive advantage in washing machines (that consume less
water than others), I will make sure they are on the list.""
 The negotiations on environmental goods and services are
part of the eight-year-old Doha round to free up world trade.
 Lamy forecast energy-related and environment-related goods
and services would probably be to Doha what financial services
were to the Uruguay round that liberated trade in them.
 ""Countries have a strong interest in improving the
efficiency of their economies by opening their markets to
environmental goods or related services,"" Lamy said.
 Expanding free trade in general is a cheap and effective way
for governments to get their economies out of crisis, he said.
 Lamy said he did not know if the debt crisis in Europe would
dent world trade. He noted that the WTO's forecast from March
was for the volume of world trade to rebound by nearly 10
percent this year after a 12 percent drop in 2009.
 ""It (the debt crisis) reinforces the attraction of a Doha
deal as a very powerful tool to exit the crisis, a low-cost,
powerful macroeconomic decision,"" Lamy said, referring to the
package of trade liberalisation on the table in the Doha round.
 Trade liberalisation compared very favourably with budgetary
stimulus in terms of the costs and benefits, he said.
""Rationally, if you look at what people need to do ... to
exit the crisis, this huge package of trade opening is there
available at low cost, very low cost for the taxpayers,"" he
said.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell in volatile
trade on Thursday, staying vulnerable on concerns other
European countries may announce regulations similar to
Germany's ban on naked short selling of some assets.
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
were under heavy selling pressure as concern over policymakers'
response to the euro zone debt crisis fueled risk aversion,
leading to liquidation of long positions.
 The dollar got a safe haven bid against most currencies but
extended losses against the yen after data showed the number of
U.S. workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance
unexpectedly rose last week for the first time since early
April. The report added to the market's risk aversion.
 The euro stayed above a four-year low of $1.2143 hit on
Wednesday in response to the German ban, but traders remained
nervous similar moves may follow, while broader concerns about
euro zone debt problems further weighed on sentiment.
 Traders also said fears other European countries may follow
Germany's lead and implement short selling bans pushed European
shares into negative territory and exacerbated the falls in the
euro and perceived riskier currencies.
 ""What began as a collapse in the euro has now shifted to a
collapse in the growth/risk trade,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto in a note to
clients. ""As the situation has escalated and austerity measures
increase, the fear has shifted to the ramification for global
growth.""
 In early New York trade, the euro was down 0.7 percent at
$1.2341 with the session peak at 1.2437 and the session low at
1.2308.
 The euro recovered from four-year lows on Wednesday as
traders covered short positions on speculation European
monetary officials might act to check its rapid fall, though
for now market players see intervention unlikely.
 Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday he
did not see a need to take immediate action to halt the euro's
decline. This was echoed by European Union Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia who said there was no need to
intervene.
 ""The bias for the euro is still lower but concerns over
excessive short positioning mean the price action will be very
volatile,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency analyst at UBS.
Traders said there was a broad tendency to sell into rallies,
adding the euro has failed to get above $1.2440 on three
occasions this week.
 ""$1.2440 is a treble top and I'm hearing of decent names
selling there. I think any type of rally you sell,"" a trader at
a European bank said.
 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR
 The Australian dollar came under further heavy selling
pressure versus the U.S. dollar and the yen in particular.
""The Australian dollar had got way overvalued - it was priced
almost for perfection and was always vulnerable to a sharp
correction despite strong economic fundamentals,"" BTMU's
Hardman said.
 The Aussie, traded down around 2.5 percent versus the U.S.
dollar at $0.8268 after falling to an 8-month low of $0.8246 in
early European trade. It was on track for its biggest weekly
fall since the fallout from the Lehman crisis in 2008.
 It fell more than 3 percent to trade below 76.00 yen for
the first time since July 2009.
 The U.S. dollar rose 0.3 percent versus a currency basket
to trade at 86.649 after surging to a 14-month high of 87.458
on Wednesday on safe-haven demand.
 The dollar was down around 1.1 percent at 90.67 yen. The
low-yielding Japanese currency held gains against the euro,
which slipped around 1.7 percent to 111.90 yen.

 * Q1 investments tumble 11 pct q/q

 By Aasa Christine Stoltz
 OSLO, May 20 (Reuters) - Norway's non-oil GDP grew by a
surprisingly weak 0.1 percent in the first quarter as
investments dropped sharply, weakening the crown and potentially
delaying the oil-rich country's next rate hike until late 2010.
 Seasonally adjusted mainland gross domestic product, the
measure most watched by markets because it strips out volatile
offshore oil and shipping, was forecast to grow 0.5 percent in
the first quarter, according to a Reuters poll of 17 economists.
 Fourth quarter non-oil GDP was revised up to 0.4 percent
growth from a previous 0.3 percent. [ID:OSL014118]
 Norway's economy has weathered the economic downturn better
than most Western economies, helped by massive stimulus measures
and numerous rate cuts by the central bank pushing the key rate
to a record low 1.25 percent. But its recovery has sputtered.
 ""Norges Bank will quite certainly adjust down its interest
rate forecast in June the way things are looking now,"" said
First Securities economist Bjoern Roger Wilhelmsen.
 ""This means that the next rate rise will not come in
September, but at the end of the year at the earliest.""
 Investments showed an 11 percent quarterly drop mainly as a
result of a cut in public investments from high levels at the
end of 2009, Statistics Norway said on Thursday.
 The crown weakened after the data and traded around 7.9825
to the euro  at 0842 GMT from 7.9727 before the data.
 Norges Bank's next rate decision meeting is scheduled for
June 23, when it also will unveil its interest rate path
forecast for future rates.
 Norway, one of the first Western economies to raise interest
rates since the global financial crisis, last raised rates on
May 5 by 25 basis points to 2.00 percent. It had earlier
projected another quarter point hike in August or September.
 The central bank forecast the country's economic recovery to
continue to gather pace but said this week that fears over debt
blowouts in the euro zone have clouded the picture for the
Norwegian economy in recent weeks.
 The data showed that overall GDP, which includes offshore
oil and shipping, fell by 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarter against
a 0.4 percent rise predicted by analysts, and compared to a 0.1
percent growth in the fourth quarter.

 By Stanley White and Holger Hansen
 TOKYO/BERLIN, May 20 (Reuters) - A senior euro zone official
said on Thursday financial markets were acting irrationally over
the euro area's debt problems and while he was concerned about
the fall in the euro, immediate action was not needed.
 The euro slumped to a four-year low on Wednesday after a
unilateral German move to ban naked short selling on some
instruments exposed political divisions in Europe and stoked
fears of tighter financial regulation.
 Underscoring those splits France, still smarting from the
German ban on which it was not consulted, said it did not share
the view of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who on Wednesday
said the euro was in danger.
 ""I absolutely do not think that the euro is in danger,""
French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde told RTL radio on
Thursday. ""The euro is a solid and credible currency.""
 China said the euro crisis -- fuelled by Germany's move to
stamp on speculators -- was adding to global uncertainties, a
factor underlined by fresh weakness in stock markets.
 Naked short selling involves selling a financial instrument
without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can
be borrowed, as would be done in a conventional short sale.
 The common currency has been under intense pressure for
months as concerns over Greece's heavy debts have cast doubt on
the euro zone's ability to pull fiscally weak EU countries out
of the mire.
 Greece braced for a 24 hour general strike on Thursday in
protest against the tough austerity measures demanded by the
European Union and the International Monetary fund in exchange
for a 110 billion euro bailout.
 Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup forum of euro
zone finance ministers, said the weakness in the euro, down more
than 7 percent against the dollar in the past month alone, was
likely due to fears that economic growth in the 16 countries
that share the currency will slow.
 But markets were acting irrationally, he said.
 ""There are expectations that growth is slowing down because
of the deficit cuts we have to take,"" Juncker told Reuters in
Tokyo.
 ""There is a certain reluctance to believe the Greeks can
overcome the current crisis. I don't think the markets are
behaving in a rational way.""
 
 NO EURO ACTION YET
 The euro rebounded late on Wednesday as traders covered
short positions on speculation European monetary officials might
move to check its rapid fall.
 Juncker, speaking to reporters after meeting Japanese
Finance Minister Naoto Kan in Tokyo, said he did not see the
need to take immediate action on the euro's rapid plunge but
said central banks were in close contact.
 ""Monetary authorities are monitoring closely exchange rate
developments and they best know what to do. I'm concerned
because the rapidness of the fall in the euro is impressive. I'm
not concerned as far as the current exchange rate is concerned.""
 The instability is worrying China though, which called for
an international response.
 ""The European sovereign debt crisis is a challenge not just
for the countries that are party to it, such as Greece. In fact,
it is a challenge to the stability of the entire international
financial market,"" said assistant finance minister Zhu Guangyao.
 ""It concerns the recovery of the entire international
economy, and so it demands a common response from the
international community,"" he said.
 Zhu told a news conference the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis showed the need for countries to control their debt
levels and maintaining the stability of major reserve currencies
was ""very important"".
 
 IRRATIONAL OR UNCERTAIN?
 Greece and Spain have promised tough austerity measures to
reduce their fiscal deficits, and the European Commission has
proposed that European Union countries submit their initial
budget proposals so the EU executive can make sure countries are
doing enough to rebuild their finances.
 The European Central Bank has also taken the unprecedented
step of buying euro-denominated government debt as part of a 750
billion euro plan to help stabilise markets.
 In an effort to counter massive volatility in markets,
Germany stepped up its fight against speculators with a ban on
some financial trades on Wednesday.
 But the move triggered big market falls and wrong footed
European governments that said they were not consulted.
 Analysts saw the move as a political gesture to placate
German public opinion after her party lost a regional election
this month.
 ""It again suggests that the Germans are no closer to
understanding that the markets are not the problem here. The
markets are right to be uncertain about the sustainability of
the euro zone in its current form,"" said Simon Tilford, chief
economist at the Centre for European Reform.
 ""What is specific to Germany is a readiness to make
unilateral announcements on things that would only be doable if
they were done collectively...It's pretty populist stuff.""

 By Claire Milhench
 LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - Stocks pared early gains on
Thursday as investors fretted about the extension of a short
selling ban to other markets, forcing the euro lower, while
European debt steadied following successful auctions.
 Wall Street looked set to open lower.
 In early European trades, the FTSEurofirst had advanced
slightly as buyers sought bargains following Wednesday's 3
percent slide. 
 But by mid-day the modest rally had run out of steam as the
euro zone's underlying problems reasserted themselves and
rumours circulated about an extension of Germany's unilateral
move to ban naked short selling of shares in certain financial
institutions, euro zone sovereign debt and related credit
default swaps.
 The decision has unsettled markets as it points to a lack of
policy coordination amongst European members and has raised
fears of further regulation.
 ""There is a rumour of the short selling ban being extended
in the euro zone,"" a trader said.
 Naked short selling involves selling a financial instrument
without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can
be borrowed, as would be done in a conventional short sale.
 MSCI's All-Country World index was down 0.68 percent while
its more volatile emerging markets component was down 1.38
percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down
1.02 percent, but energy stocks were boosted by crude oil
touching $70 a barrel before dipping back to $68.86.
 Earlier, in Japan, the Nikkei closed down 1.54 percent, a
new three-month low.
 
 BONDS PARE LOSSES
 In the fixed income markets, German government bonds pared
earlier losses after successful French and Spanish bond
auctions.
 ""Financial markets are taking a bit of a pause for breath --
that's taking some of the shine off Bunds but the adverse impact
of fiscal consolidation and the poor performance of risk markets
will help keep Bunds well underpinned near-term,"" said Nick
Stamenkovic, rate strategist at RIA Capital. 
 Greek and Portuguese yield spreads over Bunds were broadly
steady, while the cost of insuring against default by issuers
from the euro zone periphery was also steady following the
previous session's volatility.
 The euro remained vulnerable, slipping back 0.76 percent to
$1.233 in choppy trading, with extreme short positioning
exacerbating moves.
 Stuart Thomson, chief economist at Ignis Asset Management,
said he expected the euro to continue falling over the medium
term, reaching parity against the dollar by the end of 2011. 
 ""Politicians have reduced liquidity risk... but in return
have ushered in a new age of austerity in peripheral economies,""
he said in a note.
 Higher yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
came under heavy selling pressure as investors sought safer
havens. ""The Aussie is risk-driven and markets are becoming
increasingly risk-averse,"" said Geoffrey Yu, a currency analyst
at UBS.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro remained vulnerable in
volatile trading conditions on Thursday as uncertainty over
unity in the euro zone weighed on the single currency, with
extreme short positioning exacerbating moves.
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
were under heavy selling pressure as the euro zone's troubles
fuelled risk-aversion, knocking equity markets and commodities,
forcing liquidation of long positions. 
 At 0735 GMT, the euro was trading down 0.2 percent at
$1.2410 in choppy trading conditions after falling in Asia to
$1.2323. Traders noted good interest to sell rallies above
$1.2400.
 It had rebounded from a four-year low of $1.2143 on
Wednesday as traders covered short positions on speculation
European monetary officials might move to check its rapid fall.
 A European Central Bank spokesman declined comment on the
market rumours and Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said
in Tokyo on Thursday he did not see a need to take immediate
action.
 ""The bias for the euro is still lower but concerns over
excessive short positioning mean the price action will be very
volatile,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency analyst at UBS.
 Increased uncertainty over market regulation in the euro
zone was the latest negative for the euro.
 Germany's unilateral ban of naked short-selling in euro zone
bonds and some bank shares caught its European partners
unawares, suggesting the bloc was unable to form a united front
in addressing its debt crisis.
 A German parliamentary vote on a 750 billion euro rescue
package to stabilise euro zone bond markets was adding to
uncertainty.
 ""The danger now is that the next point of focus becomes the
German vote on its contribution to the ""shock and awe""
programme, most likely late on Friday night,"" said Credit
Agricole CIB analysts in a note. 
 
 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR
 The Australian dollar continued to come under heavy selling
pressure versus the U.S. dollar and the yen in particular, as
risk-aversion hit equity markets and commodities.

 The Aussie, traded down around 2 percent versus the U.S.
dollar at $0.8320 after falling to an 8-month low of $0.8255 in

 Versus the yen, it fell over 2 percent to trade below 76.00
yen for the first time since July 2009. It had hit a high of
81.83 on Monday. 
 The U.S. dollar slipped slightly versus a currency basket

 * Economy to perform slightly better than expected
 * Bank ready to cooperate with incoming government

(Adds more comments, detail)
 BUDAPEST, May 20 (Reuters) - Hungary cannot let its deficit
rise again and the central bank is ready to work with the
incoming government on drawing up a sustainable economic policy,
deputy governor Ferenc Karvalits said on Thursday.
 Hungary, whose public debt at 80 percent of GDP is the
highest in central Europe, targets a deficit of 3.8 percent of
GDP this year under a financing deal with international lenders.
 The incoming centre-right Fidesz government, however, whose
prime minister again attacked the central bank on Wednesday for
mismanaging the economic crisis, has said the 3.8 percent target
was no longer viable.
 ""Hungary is a very indebted country, therefore we believe
there is no tangible room for manoeuvre to let the budget
deficit increase again,"" Karvalits told public radio MR1-Kossuth
in an interview.
 ""We believe that it is Hungary's vital interest to ensure a
sustainable debt trajectory, and a precondition of this is that
the budget deficit remain at least around the levels achieved
with the recent measures in a lasting way.""
 He said the central bank expected the deficit at around
4-4.2 percent of GDP this year, slightly above the current
target, but higher than expected revenues thanks to a slightly
improved economic outlook may temper any increase.
 ""We are a bit above (the deficit target). At the same time
we need to see that in contrast to our last prognosis, the
Hungarian economy will perform somewhat better than we had
expected,"" Karvalits said.
 In its last inflation report issued in February, the bank
forecast the economy would shrink by another 0.2 percent this
year after 6.3 percent in 2009 -- the worst in nearly two
decades. [ID:nLDE61N0PK]
 Better than expected first-quarter GDP growth data issued
earlier this month however led most analysts to upgrade their
forecasts. [ID:nLDE64B0JA]

Schaeuble told fellow cabinet members on Wednesday their
initial spending proposals for the 2011 budget were far too
high, people who attended the cabinet meeting told Reuters.
 According to finance ministry estimates, total departmental
requests together would exceed current budget plans by nine
billion euros for the years 2011-14.
 During the euro zone debt crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel
has called for member states to cut budget deficits. However,
Germany itself is set to break the EU limit by a wide margin,
albeit less so than in most large euro zone economies.
 Werner Gatzer, a state secretary at the Finance Ministry,
also called for greater savings from government departments.
 ""To ensure the necessary amounts of budget consolidation
are achieved, I expect savings in the order of three billion
euros initially,"" Gatzer wrote in a letter obtained by Reuters.
 The letter, dated May 18, was addressed to state
secretaries (junior ministers) at every German ministry.
However, Gatzer said this was only ""a small first step"" and
that further budget savings would need to be discussed in the
next few weeks.
 Germany's public deficit is expected to exceed 5 percent of
GDP this year. Although this is significantly lower than levels
in some other euro zone states, it still breaches the European
Union's official three percent cap. The government is due to
present the draft 2011 budget at the end of June.
 For the first time, it has taken into account a new ""debt
brake"" law requiring the government to reduce the debt-to-gross
domestic product ratio and cut the structural deficit by 10
billion euros, say experts.

recovery is likely to continue over the coming months and
private consumption should begin to pick up, the German Finance
Ministry said in its monthly report on Thursday.
 ""Exports should remain the economic motor and impact
positively on the development of domestic demand,"" the ministry
wrote. ""This is what the upwards trend in both domestic and
foreign industrial orders indicates.""
 Germany exited its deepest post-war recession in the second
quarter of last year but the recovery slowed in the winter when
severe weather disrupted business activity.
 Recent economic indicators have beaten forecasts and pointed
to a renewed pick-up. Industrial output and orders surged in
March, while exports rose at their fastest rate in nearly 18
years, surpassing even the most optimistic predictions.
 The ministry said the upwards trend in industrial output
would continue over the coming months.
 Caution over private consumption would fade away as the
recovery continued and households would start spending slightly
more, the ministry added.
 ""The relatively good development on the labour market should
increasingly contribute to the recovery of private consumption,""
it said.

 By Umesh Desai
 HONG KONG, May 20 (Reuters) - Worries over the euro zone's
debt crisis hammered Asian stocks to their lowest in more than
eight months and sent the euro down, struggling to stay above
the previous day's four-year low as political divisions and
fears of more market regulation kept investors on edge.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> closed at a new three-month
low and the South Korean benchmark KOSPI <.KS11> fell to a near
three month closing low, as investors worried about the
troubles of Europe resulting in slowing growth there.
 European markets rebounded from the previous day's slump,
with the FTST Eurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> up 0.3 percent, Germany's
DAX <.GDAXI> up 0.6 percent and France's CAC <.FCHI> half a
percent higher.
 The euro, reversed its earlier fragile rally, heading back
to near four-year lows struck the previous day after Germany's
surprise ban of naked short-selling in some securities spooked
financial markets.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent from late U.S. trade to $1.2348,
having risen as far as $1.2433 on trading platform EBS in early
deals, as traders covered short positions on speculation
European monetary officials might move to check its rapid fall.
 Germany's move to stamp out speculators added further
worries to a market already jittery about Greece's heavy debts.
Investors are fearing that austerity policies, needed to pull
fiscally weak EU countries into line, will dampen European and
world growth. [ID:nSGE64J05H]
 Berlin's unilateral step suggested Europe remained unable
to form a united front in addressing its debt crisis. It
worried investors by increasing uncertainty over market
regulation.
 Traders said Thursday's market slide appeared to be driven
by sell signals from value-at-risk models, which are widely
used by trading desks and funds to determine the level of risky
positions they are willing to stomach.
 The sharp drop in the Australian dollar against the yen and
even the euro, and the euro's jump against the won, suggested
that market players were being forced to cut positions across
the board, even those bets against the single currency.
 Many traders cited a lack of liquidity across markets as
exacerbating the moves. They also noted heavy hedge fund
selling across markets, including the Aussie and won.
 The won, which logged its biggest weekly loss in more than
14 months, suffered in the broad sell-down of risky assets from
value at risk models.
 The yen , which usually gains during heightened
uncertainty and risk aversion, rose against the high-yielding
Australian dollar  which slid 3 percent on the day
pushing the unit down to a 10-month low.
 Foreign selling was seen in many equity markets in the
region and these sales are already hitting multi-month peaks.
 Credit Suisse said in a report their foreign investors'
selling in May for emerging Asia outside China and Malaysia is
already the highest monthly aggregate since October 2008.
 It said that if the pace of selling sustains for the rest
of the month there could be net sales of $14 billion, compared
with the high of $17.5 billion in August 2007, during the bear
market.
 ""We have seen a large amount of money come in and we are
beginning to see some of that trickle out,"" said Bratin Sanyal,
head of Asian equities at ING Asset Management in Hong Kong who
manages $2.4 billion.
 ""With global turmoil and growing risk aversion we are
seeing some money being pulled out and flowing back into their
home markets.""
 Asian stock markets continued to bleed for the second
straight day and are heading towards its worst weekly
performance since November 2008.
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 2.3 percent to a eight month low. It has
now fallen 8.5 percent this week and 11.3 percent this year.
Industrials <.MIAPJIN00PUS> and materials <.MIAPJMT00PUS>
shares were the biggest losers.
 The MSCI sector indexes for defensive sectors like
healthcare <.MIAPJHC00PUS> and utlities <.MIAPJUT00PUS> posted
modest losses, outperforming the broad market.
 INSTABILITY TO STAY
 Wall Street slipped on nervousness about the disarray in
Europe and on worries the crisis would hurt growth. That came
on the heels of losses in Europe for the third in four
sessions.
 ""Investors are entitled to be a little hesitant about
putting a toe into the shark-filled waters,"" said Richard
Morrow, director at E.L. & C. Baillieu Stockbroking. ""Only one
thing is certain: this volatility is likely to stay around at
least in the short term. This is a trader's market.""
 Australian shares gave up initial gains as Wall Street's
drop weighed and worries remained that Europe's problems could
hurt economic growth. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 <.AXJO> was
down 1 percent, wallowing at a 9-month low.
 South Korean assets were dealt an extra blow by rising
tensions in the Korean peninsula as Seoul exchanged tough
rhetoric with its northern neighbour over the cause of a navy
ship sinking that killed 46 sailors from the south.
 Souring risk appetite also drove demand for safe haven U.S.
Treasuries with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note
 easing to 3.35 percent after rising 2 bps the
previous day on euro jitters.
 ING's Sanyal said that aversion was a good omen for
defensive sectors.
 ""Some of the unloved sectors should do well. Telcos and
utilities have performed poorly and are underowned. With the
fear factor coming back into the market they should do well,""
he said.

 * Some talk Japan mutual funds selling euro, emerging assets
 * Aussie recovers from 8-mth lows but likely to struggle
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday, edging
back towards a four-year low as investors nervous over policy
disarray in the euro zone trimmed their assets in the region and
used the previous day's bounce to sell the currency.
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar and
yen crosses also dropped after losses in the Nikkei share average
lowered investor risk tolerance, traders said.
 There was talk some managers of Japanese mutual funds or
""toushin"" were selling assets related to emerging markets, the
euro zone and higher-yielding currencies, possibly to repatriate
funds in case stock falls led toushin holders to cancel, they
said.
 The euro had rebounded from a four-year low of $1.2143 on
Wednesday as traders covered short positions on speculation
European monetary officials might move to check its rapid fall.
 A European Central Bank spokesman declined comment on the
market rumours, and Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said
in Tokyo on Thursday he did not see a need to take immediate
action.
 ""After it rose above $1.2400, players such as speculators and
macro hedge funds were said be selling the currency,"" said a
trader at a Japanese trust bank.
 ""But they probably don't want to further build euro short
positions after seeing its sudden rebound on Wednesday. So the
euro may be supported around $1.23,"" he said.
 The euro fell 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade to $1.2352,
having risen as far as $1.2433 on trading platform EBS in early
deals. It gained more than 1.7 percent on Wednesday, notching its
best one-day gain in more than a year.
 Asian central banks, which have aggressively shifted foreign
currency reserves to the euro in the past, were also suspected of
selling, two traders said, helping to knock it down from $1.24.
 Juncker, who met Japanese Finance Minister Naoto Kan, said
monetary authorities were closely monitoring exchange rate
developments but that he was concerned at the speed of the euro's
fall rather than its level.
 The euro briefly dipped on his comments, but traders were
sceptical about the chances of intervention at this stage as euro
weakness is seen as positive for euro zone exports and financial
market turbulence was not seen as extreme enough for such action.
 On the charts, it is expected to face resistance around
$1.2445, its May 18 high.
 Increased uncertainty over market regulation in the euro zone
was also a negative for the euro.
 A day after Germany banned naked short-selling in euro zone
bonds, CDS based on those bonds and some bank shares, cracks
appeared in the euro zone, with many European governments
wrong-footed by Berlin's unilateral action. It suggested Europe
was unable to form a united front in addressing its debt crisis.
 ""The euro's bounce seems like a sucker's rally,"" Matthew
Strauss, a senior currency analyst at RBC Capital, wrote in a
note.
 ""Technically, a bounce in the euro was long overdue with
daily valuations extremely oversold, net short euro positioning
also at extremes and euro 25 delta risk reversals at record
levels.""
 Euro/dollar one-month risk reversals, a measure of currency
sentiment, showed an extreme bias for puts.
 The dollar was steady against the yen at 91.74 yen and
traders said the yen was likely to be supported on anxiety about
more regulatory curbs following Germany's move.
 Traders fear that regulators could target leveraged carry
trades next. The low-yielding yen, which is used as a funding
currency in carry trades, often gains during heightened
uncertainty and risk aversion.
 As a result, the outlook for high-yielding currencies was
grim. The Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to $0.8449, after
hitting an eight-month low of $0.8355 on Wednesday, and has lost
more than 4 percent this week. Against the yen, the Aussie fell 1
percent to 77.23 yen and had shed more than 5 percent.

 * Bond issuance near term higher, longer term reduced

 * S&P reaffirms rating, Fitch keeps negative outlook
(Adds details, comment, market reaction)
 By Gyles Beckford and Mantik Kusjanto
 WELLINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) - New Zealand's government
upgraded its growth outlook and cut its borrowing plans in its
annual budget on Thursday, drawing a mixed reception from
ratings agencies.
 The 2010/11 budget also outlined, as expected, cuts to
personal and company tax rates, as well as a rise in the value
added goods and services tax to help drive growth.
 It said it would borrow NZ$12.5 billion ($8.5 billion) in
the coming year, around NZ$2 billion more than signalled last
December, to finance a higher than expected budget deficit of
NZ$8.6 billion or 4.5 percent of gross domestic product.
Analysts had expected around $6.5 billion of deficit.
 But that was largely due to the timing of tax cuts, a still
soft revenue outlook, and higher short term debt servicing
costs.
 Further out the forecasts showed borrowing falling to NZ$6
billion in 2014, about NZ$2 billion less than expected, and
shrinking deficits, which see the economy back in surplus by
2016.
 ""On balance then, issuance is falling relative to past
forecasts, not rising,"" said Stephen Toplis, head of research
at Bank of NZ.
 The New Zealand dollar briefly gained around half a cent
after the budget to NZ$0.6855, but was then dragged as low as
$0.6704 as it was caught in broader market volatility
surrounding the euro zone's woes.
 There was little reaction in the bond market, with yields
around two basis points lower in parts due to safe haven bids.
 ""The kiwi is up (earlier) because people like what they
saw... In contrast to a lot of other countries where they are
cutting spending and raising taxes, we get a better fiscal
position and policies are generally growth enhancing,"" said
ANZ-National senior economist Khoon Goh.
 HIGHER GROWTH OUTLOOK
 Official forecasts painted a slightly rosier picture of the
economy over the next four years with faster growth, lower
unemployment, reduced borrowing and lower debt levels.
 ""The government's focus is on accelerating the economy and
ensuring the economy expands in a sustainable way,"" Finance
Minister Bill English said in a statement.
 For 2010/11, the government raised its growth forecast to
3.2 percent from 2.4 percent previously, while keeping its
growth outlook steady around 3 percent for the following three
fiscal years.
 The net debt level was forecast to peak at 27.4 percent of
gross domestic product in 2014, still comfortably low compared
with levels approaching or exceeding 100 percent of GDP in some
European countries or Japan, where debt is expected to vault
200 percent of national output.
 RATINGS
 English said the budget was strong enough compared with
other countries to deserve a positive response from ratings
agencies.
 Standard and Poors' said the budget was in line with New
Zealand's AA-plus rating and offered ""an achievable and
believable path to return the operating position to surplus.""
 In contrast, Fitch Ratings said it would not change its
negative outlook on New Zealand's AA-plus rating. It dropped
the outlook from stable last July citing the country's high
external debt levels.
 ""We are not looking at changing the outlook at this point
in time. We will be having more assessment and discussion,""
Fitch sovereign analyst Ai Ling Ngiam told Reuters. ""It looks
to us the gain in the consolidation of the budget is quite
marginal"".
 Analysts said there was little in the budget to alter the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) monetary view. The central
bank has said it expected to start raising rates from a record
low 2.5 percent in coming months as the economy gathers pace.
 ""There are not a lot of monetary policy implications, for
the RBNZ whether or not they go in June or delay will largely
depend how developments offshore pan out, particularly with the
current volatility in financial markets,"" said ANZ's Goh.
 Financial market pricing of the first rate rise on June 10
remained around 70 percent, which has eased from being fully
priced two weeks ago on soft data and global market volatility.
They also bet on 184 basis points of tightening over the next
12 months, according to a measure from Credit Suisse.

 * India has virtually no space to store wheat
 * Wheat reserves at 31 mln T, eight times the target
 * Indian wheat costly but competitive in South Asia
 * State wheat buys down 24 percent so far this year
 By Himangshu Watts and Naveen Thukral
 NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE, May 20 (Reuters) - Tarpaulin-covered
mounds of wheat facing damage from fast-approaching monsoon
rains are putting pressure on India to step up grain exports,
strengthening prospects of a bigger global wheat glut this
year.
 India will probably ship additional cargoes of wheat to its
neighbours and try to blaze inroads into Southeast Asia and the
Middle East, giving competition to Black Sea-origin grain and
squeezing global benchmark prices.
 India's fourth good harvest in a row has swelled wheat
stocks to 31 million tonnes, almost eight times its target of 4
million, forcing authorities to pile up nearly 7 million tonnes
of grain under tarpaulin in the grainbowl states of Punjab and
Haryana.
 Stocks of rice, too, at 26 million tonnes, are more than
double the target of 12.2 million and set to soar as forecasts
of normal monsoon rainfall from June will help the crop bounce
back from a 14 percent fall after last year's drought.
 ""There is so much wheat lying around that storage is a big
problem, they have to export wheat,"" said Veeresh Hiremath, a
senior analyst with brokerage Comtrade in southern Hyderabad.
""I believe there will be more government-to-government deals.""
 To prune its unmanageable stocks, the government on Tuesday
waved through exports of 100,000 tonnes of non-basmati rice to
Bangladesh, a week after permitting shipment of 400,000 tonnes
of wheat to the country.
 Still, India is reluctant to completely scrap its ban on
export of wheat and non-basmati rice for fear that could stir
up further criticism and public protest against rising food
prices, which have surged more than 16 percent in the year to
May.
 EXPORTS TO CONTINUE
 As an immediate measure to tide over the problem of plenty,
India will keep selling grain, particularly wheat, to its South
Asian neighbours so as to fill its limited storage space with
newly harvested grain and cut the risk of damage to staples in
makeshift facilities, analysts and trade officials said.
 ""Wheat stored under tarpaulin is 100 percent prone to
damage due to monsoon rains. It is quite vulnerable,"" said Adi
Narayan Gupta, chairman of the Wheat Products Promotion
Society.
 ""It is prone to rot and decay. Even in good weather, it is
not safe to stock wheat in the open beyond six months.""
 Traders said Indian wheat prices, propped up by generous
rates paid to farmers by official agencies, are too high to be
competitive in distant markets but in neighbouring countries
can challenge Black Sea wheat, which has many users in South
Asia.
 ""The implication of such a deal (sale to Bangladesh) is
that it is adding to the competition in the world wheat export
market,"" said Toby Hassall, an analyst with CWA Global Markets
in Sydney.
 Indian wheat is quoted around $230 to $240 a tonne,
including cost and freight, to Bangladesh, against $230 a tonne
for Ukrainian wheat and $280 a tonne for Australian prime
wheat.
 Traders say Indian supplies would put more pressure on
benchmark Chicago wheat prices, which have lost around 14
percent this year on prospects of growing global supplies of
the grain for a third straight year.
 ""What the market has to do now is to generate that
additional demand and the way it does that is by weak prices,""
said Hassall.
 ""The price of wheat will have to fall enough so that it
stimulates additional demand to draw down the swelling global
stockpiles.""
 In a forecast this month, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture put 2010/11 world wheat closing stocks at about 198
million tonnes, up from around 193 million this year and 165
million in 2008/09.
 Officials in the northern Indian state of Punjab said that
by April 1, more than 5 million tonnes of wheat had been
stocked up since last year, forcing authorities to turn to even
more make-shift storage facilities and export more grain.
 And the situation can only become more dire as India is
likely to produce 80.98 million tonnes of wheat in the harvest
of April and May, beating last year's record of 80.68 million.
 Government agencies, the dominant wheat buyers, have slowed
purchases as they already hold much more than they can handle,
with wheat purchases having fallen nearly 24 percent so far
this year, to 21.1 million tonnes.
 ""Despite the fact that the government has slowed its
procurement as it struggles to store wheat, it will end up
buying 22-23 million tonnes. But even 22-23 million tonnes of
procurement is simply huge,"" Gupta said.

 * Chance of agreement about yuan is remote -researcher
 BEIJING, May 20 (Reuters) - China and the United States will
largely sidestep the yuan at a summit next week because too much
pressure would be counter-productive to getting Beijing to
change its policy, a Chinese central bank adviser said in
comments reported on Thursday.
 Li Daokui, an academic adviser to the People's Bank of
China, also said that the United States seemed less insistent
now about pushing for yuan appreciation because it was aiming
for broader cooperation with Beijing.
 ""Despite mounting pressure for a stronger yuan in the past
few months, officials from both sides are expected to play down
the currency issue during the meeting, leaving more leeway for
China to decide the fate of its own currency,"" Li told the China
Daily.
 As one of three academic advisers on the central bank's
monetary policy committee, Li has little, if any, influence over
policy decisions but has knowledge of high-level thinking.
 The United States will continue nudging China at the
Strategic and Economic Dialogue next Monday and Tuesday to let
the yuan appreciate, but trade issues appeared to be higher on
the U.S agenda ahead of the bilateral meetings. [ID:nN19236087]
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and the department's
senior coordinator for Chinese affairs said on Wednesday they
will urge China to see yuan appreciation as being in its own
interest as well as that of the global economy.
 China has held its currency at about 6.83 to the dollar
since mid-2008, trying to buffer its economy from the ravages of
the global financial crisis.
 Many analysts and investors had thought that next week's
summit or a G20 meeting in June were unofficial deadlines for
Beijing to resume yuan appreciation, lest it face punitive
measures from Washington.
 But the deepening of sovereign debt worries in Europe
coupled with signs of a stronger U.S. recovery have softened
criticism of China's yuan policy and cast doubt on whether it is
still under intense pressure to move.
 Separately, Lei Yanhua, a researcher at the Ministry of
Commerce, said there was little possibility of the two countries
reaching an agreement about the yuan at their meetings next
week, the International Business Daily reported on Thursday.
 Lei argued that yuan appreciation was not key to addressing
the China-U.S. trade imbalance and that any yuan appreciation
made under duress would harm both China and the global economy.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, May 20 (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew 1.2 percent
in the first quarter, outpacing its euro zone and U.S. peers
with the help of consumer spending and solid exports to Asia,
but is seen slowing as the effect of government stimulus fades.
 Market turmoil stemming from Europe's debt crisis is also
clouding the outlook for the world's No. 2 economy with the
euro's woes threatening to drive the yen higher and hurt
exports, which may also suffer from euro zone's
belt-tightening.
 The quarterly expansion, the fastest in three quarters,
translates into an annualised growth of 4.9 percent, below a
median market forecast of 5.4 percent, but topped 3.2 percent
growth in the United States and 0.8 percent growth in the euro
zone in the same period.
 The data will offer some relief to the Bank of Japan, which
is considering drawing up a new loan scheme to encourage banks
to lend more to industries with growth potential in what it
describes as a long-term approach to beat deflation.
 ""The figures clearly indicate that the Japanese economy is
recovering on the back of the expansion in exports, mainly to
Asia,"" said Azusa Kato, an economist at BNP Paribas.
 ""As long as the Asian economy holds steady, some decline in
exports to Europe won't hurt very much, though it would be a
different story if those problems started causing turmoil in
financial markets and a plunge in European and U.S. stocks.""
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan said financial market
developments and deflation remained risks to Japan's recovering
economy.
 Japanese policymakers have declared ending the prolonged
period of price declines, which tend to encourage businesses
and consumers to delay spending, as their policy priority.
 ""Japan is still in moderate deflation,"" Kan told reporters
after the data. ""I hope the Bank of Japan guides monetary
policy appropriately and flexibly,"" he said.
 The central bank concludes a two-day policy meeting on
Friday. It is widely expected to keep its policy rate at 0.1
percent, though it may outline its new loan plan.
 EFFECTS OF STIMULUS START TO FADE
 Consumer spending, which makes up about 60 percent of the
economy, grew 0.3 percent, partly due to a rush in demand for
flat-screen TVs ahead of a change in April in a government
incentive scheme for low-emission electronic goods.
 But the figure came short of a 0.9 percent gain expected.
 ""It was a little disappointing as many economists expected
an export-led recovery to boost domestic demand more strongly,""
said Hiroshi Watanabe, an economist at Daiwa Institute of
Research.
 ""Domestic demand is picking up with a lag, but the pace of
recovery will slow later this year as government stimulus for
purchases of durable goods expire.""
 Domestic demand contributed 0.6 percentage points to GDP
growth, the most in three years, with capital spending rising
1.0 percent and housing investment up 0.3 percent, its first
rise in five quarters.
 The economy also benefited from strong growth elsewhere in
Asia, with external demand contributing 0.7 percentage point to
GDP. Solid exports to Asia have helped Japan's economy recover
gradually after pulling out of recession in the second quarter
of last year.
 But analysts say the European debt crisis and the ensuing
market turmoil may slow economic growth around the world,
including Asia, and dent Japanese exports.
 ""If that happens on top of stock falls and yen rises,
government pressure will mount on the Bank of Japan to ease
policy further,"" Watanabe said. ""But at the moment that sort of
policy action could not be justified in light of the solid
economic growth we have seen.""
 Highlighting the persistence of deflation, the annual GDP
deflator -- a broad measure of price moves -- hit a record low
of minus 3.0, while the seasonally-adjusted GDP deflator was
almost unchanged from the previous quarter after a fourth
straight quarter of declines.

 TOKYO, May 20 (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew 1.2 percent in
the first quarter, the biggest expansion in three quarters,
buoyed by robust exports to Asia and a stimulus-fuelled recovery
in consumption.
 The expansion in gross domestic product (GDP) translates into

recover from its current financial crisis by continuing to hold
the yuan stable, Commerce Minister Chen Deming has said.
 Speaking during a visit to Austria, Chen reiterated his
long-standing position that exchange rate stability was
essential to ensuring broader economic stability.
 He also said that exchange rate policy was a sovereign issue
for each country to decide ""according to its own situation"",
Xinhua news agency reported late on Wednesday.
 The commerce ministry has been the staunchest opponent
within the Chinese government for a resumption of yuan
appreciation, after 22 months in which Beijing has frozen the
currency at about 6.83 to the dollar to help cushion the economy
from the global financial crisis.
 Some Chinese economists have said that sovereign debt
worries in Europe offer Beijing an opportunity to let the yuan
start rising again, because the risk aversion sweeping through
global markets would limit inflows of much-feared speculative
capital looking to play the yuan's rise.
 But others have said that the potential debt crisis shows
that financial conditions are still turbulent, justifying
Beijing's prudence in maintaining its de facto dollar peg.

 * USD and yen supported by flight to safety
 * Aussie struggling near 10-mth lows, risk reversals spike
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, May 21 (Reuters) - The euro inched up on Friday as a
bout of short-covering extended, while the Australian dollar was
struggling near 10-month lows hurt by a wave of long liquidation
by investors like hedge funds and Japanese margin traders.
 The yen  and the U.S. dollar were broadly higher as
sentiment towards riskier assets continued to suffer on mounting
worries about the euro zone which led investors to sell stocks
and commodities in droves. The yen and the greenback are
generally favoured when there is a spike in risk aversion.
 In Asian trade, the euro  firmed to $1.2540 from
$1.2507 late in New York on Thursday when it went as high as
$1.2598. It got a boost on Thursday, helped by its gains versus
the Swiss franc and speculation European monetary officials might
intervene to prop up the single currency.
 On the year, however, the euro is down over 12 percent
against the dollar. Despite Thursday's rise, sentiment on the
currency remains decidedly negative, with investors concerned
about a seeming lack of unity among euro zone leaders in
addressing the region's debt crisis. [ID:nSGE64J05H]
 More investors sold the high-yielding Australian dollar
, spurred by uncertainty over financial market regulation
after Germany banned some speculative trades and by worries that
the euro-zone debt problems would hurt global growth.
 The Australian dollar  was down at $0.8161, not far
from a 10-month low of $0.8071. It lost over 3 percent on
Thursday. The Aussie/yen  was down at 73.48 yen, near
levels not seen since last July as carry trades were unwound by
nervous margin traders.
 ""This is a classic shift in investor focus,"" said Greg Gibbs,
currency analyst at RBS. ""The Aussie has plunged through some key
technical levels and will find it tough to regain its feet. It
will be treated as one of the primary vehicles to express a
negative view on the European debt crisis and fears of sustained
contagion to the global banking system.""
 Indeed, Aussie/dollar 1-mth risk reversal 
shows an extreme bias for Aussie puts with markets now favouring
puts by over 6 percent. That partly reflected a growing need
among investors to hedge against further declines in the Aussie,
although option traders said liquidity conditions were very thin.
 The Aussie also slid on the euro , falling to its
lowest since Feb. 12, with the euro partly helped by talk of
suspected intervention by Swiss authorities in the euro/Swiss
 cross.
 Swiss National Bank Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan on Thursday
repeated a pledge to shield Switzerland from the euro zone debt
crisis that could potentially lead to deflation.
 The euro  was at 1.4401 Swiss francs, not far from
Thursday's high of 1.4455. Euro/yen  was up in volatile
trade, at 112.45 yen after having fallen by more than 1.5 percent
on Thursday.
 The dollar recovered some of its steep losses against the yen
 inching up to 89.85 yen, after having lost more than 2
percent. The dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.32 percent at 85.84.

 * U.S. unlikely to push hard for China yuan rise
 * Trying to bring global pressure to bear on currency
 By Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The United States will
continue nudging China at top-level talks in Beijing next week
to let its yuan currency appreciate, but trade issues appeared
to be higher on the U.S agenda ahead of the sessions.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and the department's
senior coordinator for Chinese affairs said on Wednesday they
will urge China to see yuan appreciation as being in its own
interest as well as that of the global economy.
 But next Monday and Tuesday's Strategic and Economic
Dialogue in Beijing is essentially cast as one in a series of
gatherings between now and late June in which the Obama
administration will try to gently push its point that Beijing
should act.
 ""It's very important, and we've made very clear that a more
market-oriented exchange rate would contribute to balanced,
sustainable growth,"" David Loevinger, Treasury's senior
coordinator for Chinese affairs, said at a briefing.
 Earlier, Geithner said yuan appreciation was not just a
U.S.-China issue but one involving the whole global economy.
China has amassed huge trade surpluses and foreign reserves
while becoming an exporting powerhouse. Now, the United States
and others want China to boost consumption at home.
 The U.S. Treasury has postponed a report on currency
practices of key trade partners past a scheduled April 15
release, saying it wanted to explore the issue further at S&ED
talks and at meetings of Group of 20 finance ministers in early
June and G20 political leaders later next month.
 CLOCK STILL TICKING
 Many analysts saw that as an effective deadline for Beijing
to resume letting its yuan, also called the renminbi, rise in
value or risk being named a currency manipulator with potential
trade sanctions to follow.
 Democratic Senator Charles Schumer and nine other senators
this week wrote to Geithner urging him to take a stern line
with Chinese officials over Beijing's refusal to release an
International Monetary Fund report that they believe concluded
China manipulates the yuan's value for a trade advantage.
 The staff report was part of the IMF's annual consultations
with China last summer. Most countries let the IMF release the
staff assessments. China had done so in previous years but did
not this time.
 Schumer said U.S. officials should push China in next
week's talks to release the report.
 Geithner said he didn't know when China will act on its
currency.
 ""I don't know when they're going to move,"" he said in an
interview on CNBC television. ""But I think it's very much in
their interest for them to move.""
 Trading in offshore dollar/yuan forwards on Wednesday
implied that markets thought chances for future yuan
appreciation were lower. But trading was thin and market
participants were awaiting next week's talks for any hint of a
shift in China's yuan policy.
 One factor complicating efforts to push China toward
resuming the yuan's appreciation -- a move it permitted from
mid-2005 until mid-2008 but then abruptly halted -- is the
recent steady decline in the euro's value.
 That puts China's exports to Europe at risk because a
weaker euro raises import prices and is likely to increase
Beijing's reluctance to let the yuan rise in value.
 EUROPEAN CRISIS A WORRY
 A Chinese Ministry of Commerce report issued on Wednesday
said the yuan has risen nearly 14.5 percent against the euro so
far this year and predicted it will hurt exports this year.
 Loevinger linked Beijing's stated concern about the size of
U.S. budget deficits with the U.S. call for China to boost
consumer spending at home rather than relying on exporting its
way to wealth.
 ""The administration is very committed, once the recovery is
fully assured, to bringing the fiscal deficit down to a
sustainable level,"" he said, which may pinch Americans' ability
to be the world's most voracious buyers.
 ""The implication for China is that the U.S. consumer is
going to play a different role in this recovery ... and it's
more important than ever that China accelerate its efforts to
accelerate home-grown consumption-based growth,"" he said.
 Loevinger said the United States was concerned about
Chinese industrial policies that some say favor China's
companies over foreign competitors and interfere with trade.
 ""We have no problem with China promoting innovation ... but
we want to make sure that they do it in a way that doesn't
close off markets for U.S. goods and services,"" he said.
 Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will lead a
delegation of about 200 U.S. officials to the Beijing talks for
the second round of meetings since the Obama administration
took office.
 The diplomatic side of the talks will cover a range of
sensitive issues from cooperation on efforts to curb Iran's
nuclear ambitions to what measures countries can agree on to
reduce pollution and deal with climate change.
 The first meeting in Washington last summer made little
impact, but U.S. officials appear to be aiming for a more
significant outcome. Geithner arrives in Beijing on Sunday and
will hold a working lunch with Zhou Xiaochuan. China's central
bank governor, and a working dinner with Vice Premier Wang
Qishan ahead of the May 24-25 sessions.

 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro soared on speculation

 The euro rose from a four-year low to notch its best

financial regulation, boosting risk aversion.

 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose from a four-year
low against the dollar on Wednesday to notch its best one-day
gain in more than a year as traders bought the currency on
speculation European monetary officials might support it.
 Market talk of potential meetings or action by the European
Central Bank pushed the euro higher from its lowest level since
April 2006. That level -- $1.2143 -- was hit on electronic
trading platform EBS before the New York session after
Germany's ban on Tuesday of naked short selling of some
securities.
 A European Central Bank spokesman, however, declined to
comment on market rumors of fresh central bank action.
 ""We've got this rally in the euro and I think it's the

currency strategist, at OANDA in Toronto.
 ""The market is worried or is anticipating some sort of

 The last time a major coordinated effort was made to
intervene was in September 2000 when the Federal Reserve, Bank
of England, Bank of Japan, and Bank of Canada joined forces
with the ECB to support a beleaguered euro. At that time, the
euro hit a trough below US$0.85.
 In late afternoon new York trading, the euro was last up
1.7 percent against the dollar at $1.2391 EUR=EBS> after going
as high as $1.2399, according to electronic trading platform
EBS.
 The euro's move to a four-year low at $1.2143 stopped ahead
of key technical support at $1.2135, the 50 percent retracement
of the entire bull move in the euro from all-time lows near
$0.82 to the record highs just above $1.60.
 Traders said option barriers at $1.22 were taken out and
more were lined up at $1.21, $1.20 and right down to $1.15.
 The euro hit session highs after the release of the Federal
Reserve's minutes of its latest meeting. The minutes showed the
Fed upgraded its outlook on the U.S. economy, boosting risk
appetite in the market. For the Fed minutes, click on

 Given the euro zone's debt problems, the euro has become a
proxy for risk appetite, rising when there's positive economic
news.
 The single currency is still down more than 13 percent
against the dollar so far this year, hammered by concerns
Europe's debt problems and austerity measures to combat them
could hamper euro zone economic recovery.
 EXTREME BEARISH EURO SENTIMENT
 In the options market, euro/dollar one-month risk reversals
EUR1MRR=GFI, a measure of currency sentiment, showed an extreme
bias for puts, rising to -2.925 vols on Wednesday from -2.6125
on Tuesday, according to GFI data. Risk reversals hit a high
bid of -4.175 earlier in the session, the most bearish
sentiment on the euro since GFI made options data available to
Reuters in early 2007.
 In general, put options suggest investors are betting on a
decline in the currency.
 Euro/dollar one-month volatility EUR1MO=>, a gauge of the
option market's expectations on a currency's trading range,
surged to 16.55 from 15.25 percent on Tuesday.

 * Scale of $8 trln reserves preventing shifts in makeup
 * G20 needs to monitor, defuse involuntary stockpiling
 * Marginal moves beyond G3 one possible short-term solution
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Future stability of the world's
biggest bond markets lies largely in the hands of about 14
central banks holding trillions of dollars in currency reserves
banked in as much as half the world's tradeable government debt.
 Yet, Western governments' biggest creditors -- even mindful
of average budget deficits next year in the United States, euro
zone and Britain in excess of 8 percent of national output --
have little choice but stay on autopilot.
The sheer scale of global reserves -- some $8 trillion held
largely by China, Japan and developing countries across Asia as
well as oil exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia -- means any
major shift away from existing holdings now would likely sink
the very investments central banks are trying to protect.
 In a development once likened by White House economic
adviser Lawrence Summers to ""mutually-assured financial
destruction"", currency-pegging central banks of the developing
world have more than quadupled holdings of dollars, euros,
sterling and yen in just 10 years and banked them in
corresponding government debt.
 This effectively subsidised the borrowing of U.S. and
European governments, their firms and households; underwrote
consumption of exports from the reserve builders; and
facilitated an explosion of Western government borrowing with
barely any interest rate penalty.
 But as private investors now grow increasingly wary of
Western debt mountains, the scale of interdependency between the
richest, most indebted section of the Group of 20 economies and
developing nations within that group has intensified.
 And the test of the G20 as a global economic steering body
may now be how it defuses what has become an almost involuntary
financial ""arms race"".
 
 SHEER SCALE
 Citigroup currency economist Steven Englander points out
global reserves have risen to well over 50 percent of all
outstanding government bonds from just over a quarter in 2000.
 The big four liquid world currencies dominate. About two-
thirds of reserves are held in dollars, about a quarter in euros
and about 3 percent each in sterling and yen.
 But even a 5 percent change in reserve allocations now would
require a seismic shift of $400 billion across currencies --
something that would see all financial prices cascade in its
slipstream.
 The giant and liquid U.S. Treasury market frequently shivers
on speculation about the behaviour of the big reserve holders
but the impact of any shift in direction on smaller markets such
as British gilts could be chilling.
 Raphael Gallardo, head of macro economic research at Axa
Investment Managers in Paris, says sterling reserves imply
central bank managers hold almost a quarter of the entire 800
billion pound gilt market. Just a one percentage point reduction
in the sterling share of their reserves would hit the market by
up to 50 billion pounds.
More immediately, the euro zone's existential crisis over
Greece's risk of default and the danger of contagion across the
zone has raised concerns about reserve managers rethinking their
gradual, decade-long diversification from dollars to euros.
 With euros now accounting for about 25-30 percent of world
reserves, or about two trillion euros, the risk of the slightest
shift in percentages is treated with great caution.
 Stephen Jen at BlueGold Capital Management estimates that
the 10 percent drop in the euro/dollar exchange rate this year
would have seen the top eight reserve holders taking a valuation
hit of as much as $200 billion -- China taking an $80 billion
hit, Russia $14 billion and $7 billion for South Korea.
 Although valuations ebb and flow with the vagaries of
currency markets, they do illustrate the scale of the reserves
game in 2010 and Jen said this could prompt a destabilising
rethink on global holdings at large.
 ""Central banks' reserve managers are presumably
reconsidering their dollar diversification strategy, now that
the euro is also found to be less than a perfect 'anti-dollar',""
said Jen, referring to the rise in the euro's share of world
reserves from 18 percent at its launch in 1999.
 Axa's Gallardo also thinks the long-standing policy of
seeking diversification from dollars could be reconsidered.
 ""We may see gradual reverse diversification from the euros
and sterling back to dollars,"" he said.
 But here's the bind. Such a shift could be so devastating to
the markets in question that central banks would end up taking
even bigger losses on their portfolios than already experienced,
and ensuing global financial turmoil - as seen recently with
Greece - would require action at G20 level anyway.
As a result, Englander at Citi doubts reserve managers will
upset the apple cart and he showed that, adjusting for valuation
effects, relative allocations between currencies has actually
changed little since 2002.
 He said that at the margins they might instead consider
adding more relatively liquid currencies from other more
fiscally sound countries such as Canada or Australia.
 ""The likely outcome on the margin is that reserve managers
in the short term will diversify out of G3 when possible and in
the long term consider policies to significantly reduce the pace
of reserve accumulation.""

 * Euro recovers after early fall to four-year low
 * Uncertainty surrounds German naked short-selling ban
 * Fed upgrades U.S. economic forecast
(Adds comment, byline, updates prices)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro rallied from a
four-year low against the dollar on Wednesday, as traders
bought the unit amid speculation European monetary officials
may act to support the single euro zone currency.
 Market talk on potential meetings or action by the European
Central Bank pushed the euro up from its lowest level since
April 2006.
 That level -- $1.2143 -- was hit on electronic trading
platform EBS before the New York session after Germany's ban on
Tuesday of naked short-selling of some securities.
 An ECB spokesman, however, declined to comment on market
rumors of fresh central bank action.
 ""We've got this rally in the euro and I think it's the
market's understanding and fear that the G7 is concerned about
the speed of the euro's decline,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief
currency strategist, at OANDA in Toronto.
 ""The market is worried or is anticipating some sort of
verbal intervention or even a multilateral currency
intervention to boost the euro,"" he added.
 The last time a major coordinated effort was made to
intervene was in September 2000 when the Federal Reserve, Bank
of England, Bank of Japan and Bank of Canada joined forces with
the ECB to support a beleaguered euro.
 At that time, the euro hit a trough below US$0.85.
 In early afternoon trading, the euro was up 1.6 percent
against the dollar at $1.2378 after strengthening as high as
$1.2399, according to electronic trading platform EBS.
 The euro hit session highs after the release of the Federal
Reserve's minutes of its latest meeting, which showed the Fed
upgraded its outlook on the U.S. economy, boosting risk
appetite in the market.
 Given the euro zone's debt problems, the euro has become a
proxy for risk appetite, rising when there is positive economic
news.
 The euro rose nearly 2 percent against the Swiss franc at
1.4285 francs after going as high as 1.4307. The euro was on
track for its best one-day gain against the Swiss currency
since March 2009 amid speculation the Swiss National Bank
intervened to counteract the franc's strength in recent
sessions.
 The euro was last up more than 1 percent against the yen at
113.30 yen.
 The single currency is still down more than 13 percent
against the dollar so far this year, hammered by concerns
Europe's debt problems and austerity measures to combat them
could hamper the euro zone's economic recovery.
 Germany on Tuesday banned naked short selling of euro zone
government bonds, some stocks and naked selling of credit
protection backed by sovereign debt.
 The announcement of the German ban sparked a wave of
uncertainty which initially lifted the U.S. dollar and yen.

 * FDA chief says counterfeiting growing in complexity, scale
 * WHO's Chan says he does not seek drug patent policing role
 
 By Stephanie Nebehay
 GENEVA, May 19 (Reuters) - Production and sale of
counterfeit drugs is on the rise in rich and poor countries,
with more unwary consumers buying them over the Internet,
experts warned on Wednesday.
 Fake or substandard versions of medicines are often hidden
in cargos taking circuitous routes to mask their country of
origin as part of criminal activity worth billions, they add.
 ""They put people at risk of harm from medical products that
may contain too much, too little, or the wrong active ingredient
and/or contain toxic ingredients,"" said Margaret Hamburg, head
of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 ""Counterfeiting is growing in complexity, scale and
geographic scope,"" she said in a speech to the annual
ministerial meeting of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
 In wealthy countries, counterfeiting often involves
""expensive hormones, steroids and anti-cancer medicines and
pharmaceuticals related to lifestyle,"" a WHO report said.
 But in developing countries, especially Africa, counterfeit
medicines are commonly available to treat life-threatening
conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, it said.
 Nigeria, referring to a case involving tainted teething
syrup in Feb. 2009, said the consequences were often deadly.
 ""Only last year we lost 84 children in Nigeria due to
fraudulent practices in some countries. It is lives we are
talking about,"" Nigeria's delegate told the talks.
 Margaret Chan, WHO director-general, said that illicit
products had also increased the problem of drug resistance,
including to vital anti-malarials and HIV/AIDS drugs.
 ""For a patient, any medicine with compromised safety,
efficacy or quality is dangerous,"" she said.
 Major generic drug makers India and Brazil, backed by health
activists, charge that concerns about counterfeit drugs are
being hijacked by pharmaceutical companies keen to protect their
patents against legitimate generic competitors.
 ""What we object to is a group of private companies, with the
help of the (WHO) secretariat, waging war in this organisation
against generic medicines,"" Brazil's ambassador Maria Nazareth
Farani Azevedo said in a speech.
 Chan said that her United Nations agency would not be drawn
into policing intellectual property (IP). ""The role of the WHO
should be concentrating on public health, not on law enforcement
nor intellectual property enforcement.""
 Research and development-based pharmaceutical companies say
that counterfeit medicines pose a threat to patients and they
are not driven by commercial interest in fighting the scourge.
 There were 1,693 known incidents of counterfeit medicines
last year, a rise of 7 percent, according to the Geneva-based
group whose members include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche,
GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis.

* Coalition and opposition urged action
 * Crisis shows Merkel as ""fairweather chancellor""

(Adds analyst on Merkel motivation)
 By Stephen Brown
 BERLIN, May 19 (Reuters) - Germany's go-it-alone attack on
risky financial bets may have taken both the markets and its EU
partners by surprise, but domestic pressure on Chancellor Angela
Merkel to some extent made such a move inevitable.
 The European Commission and Paris were peeved not to have
been consulted on the overnight ban on naked short selling of
some assets, and shaken markets said it came ""out of the blue"".
 But Merkel was under pressure from her own conservative
party to push not only for a Europe-wide tax on financial
transactions to cover the cost of the crisis, but also
specifically for a naked short-selling ban.
 ""The room for manoeuvre that Mrs Merkel has is not as big as
many people think,"" Gerd Langguth, a political scientist at Bonn
University and a Merkel biographer, told Reuters.
 In recent weeks Merkel has been criticised at home for her
hesitant response to the Greek debt crisis, evicted from power
in North Rhine-Westphalia state and trumped by France's Nicolas
Sarkozy on the rescue package for the euro.
 Political analyst Franz Decker said the latest initiative
showed Merkel was ""a fair weather chancellor whose leadership
qualities were not seriously tested in her first term in
office.""
 Good external conditions during her 2005-2009 first term at
the head of a stronger Grand Coalition with the Social Democrats
(SDP) helped her cope with the banking crisis after the Lehmans
collapse, he said.
 But her current Free Democrat partners ""do not provide much
support"" -- hence her unsure response to the debt crisis
triggered by Greece, said Decker.
 This time, she had not consulted her EU partners partly
because she tended to see things from a German rather than a
European standpoint -- unlike her mentor Helmut Kohl or former
SDP Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, he said.
 ""On European politics, Merkel often approaches things from a
national viewpoint, not with the supranational vision shown by
Kohl or Schroeder, who sometimes put European policies ahead of
national interests,"" said Decker.

 PRESSURE FOR ACTION
 Merkel came under pressure from both the public and from
politicians on both sides, exasperated at Germany's role as
""paymaster"" of the EU, to take some action against countries
running up unsustainable deficits and against fickle markets.
 Volker Kauder, leader of the conservative faction of the
ruling coalition in the lower house of parliament, called for a
ban on naked short-selling hours before the ban was announced on
Tuesday..
 The opposition Social Democrats, Merkel's coalition partners
until last year, have said they will back the 750 billion euro
emergency package for the euro in Friday's key parliamentary
vote only if she promises to impose a tax on financial markets.
 Conservative MP Thomas Silberhorn, showing that some want
even more drastic measures, said he favoured a mechanism for
debt-laden states in crisis to be declared insolvent and quit
the currency union.
 ""We need to keep this option ..."" to leave countries ""no
other option except to exit the euro zone"", he told foreign
correspondents on Wednesday.
 Merkel has consistently spoken out against ""speculators"",
notably at crisis summits in London and Pittsburgh last year.
But analysts say both the tone of her comments on the perils
facing the euro, and the timing of the initiative on short
selling, were unhelpful in the context of a nervous market.
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said restrictions
on trading were ""not good"" historically.
 ""In the short term, such a politically motivated ad hoc
regulation should be seen as negative since it alienates market
participants,"" said Close Brothers Seydler's Roger Peeters.
 Some areas of the German banking industry came out in
favour, public sector banks saying it was ""top priority"" to
restore stability in markets, with Germany leading the way.
 
 FROM GERMAN VIEWPOINT
 The EU's executive commission, some EU partners and even
some bankers showed interest in seeing such a ban extended to
other countries and assets -- but pointed out that this would
need closer coordination.
 Langguth believed the ban showed that Merkel was ""very much
under pressure, maybe more than other prime ministers in
Europe"", not just because of defeat in North Rhine-Westphalia
but also because she faces six regional votes next year.
 She had had to respond to the widespread feeling that the
Greek rescue package, and possible bailouts for others in the
euro zone, were a ""bottomless pit"" for German public money.
 But he saw little risk of Germany's underlying commitment to
Europe wavering, noting that it had no major eurosceptical party
except possibly the far-left Linke.
 ""Of course at the moment some Germans don't feel as good
about European integration as maybe five years ago. But overall
the German political elite is still in favour of the European
Union and I do not expect any real change,"" said Langguth.

Wednesday dismissed accusations by backbench parliamentarians
that it made it easier for speculators to sell short Greek
government bonds, helping to deepen the country's debt crisis.
 Ten deputies of the ruling Socialist party filed a
parliamentary question earlier in the day, asking the government
to explain why the Bank of Greece in October extended the
deadline to settle failed bond trades to 10 days from three.
 ""Extending this period ... created a large scope for
profiteering and manipulation,"" the deputies said.
 Greek bond yield spreads versus German bunds soared from
October, when Greece's incoming Socialist government sharply
revised upwards the country's budget deficit. Greece's debt woes
shook the euro and led to an international 110 billion euro
($137 billion) bailout for the indebted country.
 The Bank of Greece dismissed the accusations.
 ""There is clearly confusion,"" it said in a statement. The
bank said it did not extend any period to settle bond trades but
introduced rules that are common in other bond markets.
 ""Any remarks about manipulation, as a result of the alleged
extension of the settlement period is groundless,"" it said in a

 By Claire Sibonney
 TORONTO, May 19 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar hit its
weakest level against the U.S. currency since May 7 on
Wednesday, hurt by falling commodity prices and a growing fear
Europe's woes will hurt Canada's economic recovery.
 Jittery investors, already worried that deep government
spending cuts in Europe will stifle growth, sent prices of
global equities and other riskier assets even lower after
Germany clamped down on short-selling of some securities.
[MKTS/GLOB]
 ""There continues to be a scramble for U.S. dollar liquidity
and I think that's part of why the Canadian dollar is suffering
right now,"" said Tom Nakamura, a fixed-income portfolio manager
at AGF Investments.
 ""The underlying issues, the problems in Europe, are still
there,"" he added.
 At 1:15 a.m. (1715 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was
at C$1.0480 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.42 U.S. cents, down from
C$1.0370 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.43 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's
close.
 The currency hit a session low of C$1.0538, or 94.89 U.S.
cents.
 Germany surprised markets on Tuesday with a ban on ""naked""
short-selling of some stocks and bonds. In naked short-selling,
a trader sells a financial instrument short, betting that it
will fall, but without first borrowing the instrument or
ensuring it can be borrowed, as would be done in conventional
short-selling. [ID:nN18512882]
 The move sent shockwaves through markets and contributed to
a drop in commodity prices, including a slide in oil prices to
their lowest intraday level since Sept. 30. [O/R]
 BMO Capital Markets warned in a note to clients that the
European situation poses ""serious risks"" to Canada's economic
outlook, largely through financial market and commodity price
channels as opposed to direct impacts on trade.
 ""We have already nudged lower our view on the Canadian
dollar, and the downside risks for the currency are now much
more prominent than a few short weeks ago,"" wrote economists
Doug Porter and Benjamin Reitzes.
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the Bank of Canada's key policy rate, have
fallen in recent weeks and on Wednesday indicated just a 51
percent chance of a June 1 rate increase. 
 Currencies tend to strengthen as interest rates rise as
higher rates attract capital flows.
 The European news overshadowed a report on Wednesday that
showed Canadian wholesale trade grew twice as much as expected
in March at 1.4 percent. [ID:nN19110938]
 BONDS MIXED
 Canadian bonds prices were mixed, though an auction for

 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro rallied strongly on
speculation it had hit a short-term bottom on Wednesday but
equity markets fell worldwide after Germany's move to ban some
naked short sales of stocks and bonds unsettled investors.
 Despite a 1.0 percent bounce in the euro, assets perceived
as being risky fell in price as concerns the German ban

 * Low spending dulls inflation risk, calms internal tensions
 
 By Krista Hughes
 FRANKFURT, May 19 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is
quietly happy with the results of its government bond buying
over the last 10 days, which have generated a relatively large
bang in the market for relatively few bucks spent.
Central bank insiders said the bond purchases -- 16.5
billion euros of which had been settled by last Friday -- were
having an impact despite modest volumes, while concerns about
divisions within bank over the scheme may have been overplayed.
 ""The amount we spent initially ... to buy bonds and
stabilize the debt market has worked well and was an amount far
below what was anticipated by markets. We did it with a value
much lower than what many thought,"" a European monetary source
said.
 ""These purchases, which will continue, are being made
quietly through banks. There is great cooperation between
central banks and there is no absolute specialization - a
central bank may buy debt from another country or countries. The
rest is secret.""
 Debt markets have certainly been calmer since the ECB
abandoned its opposition to buying government bonds last Monday
and national central banks started making purchases.
 The gap between Greek 10-year bonds and their German
equivalent has roughly halved from a lifetime high above 1,100
basis points on May 7, the last trading day before the ECB's
interventions were announced, and the cost of insuring
higher-yielding debt against default has fallen.
 ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said the
amount central banks would spend depended on the success of the
program, but it was not targeting set prices.
Another central bank insider said the ECB's spend would be
finely judged.
 ""This ECB move is like a dollar intervention. Sometimes you
don't need much money (to regain confidence) and sometimes you
need a lot of money,"" he said.
 The relatively low sum euro zone central banks have paid out
so far should also help to ease concerns about the potential
inflationary impact of the purchases, which are already driving
a wedge among the ECB's 22 policymakers.
 Bundesbank President Axel Weber went public on the day of
the decision with his concerns about the impact on prices, and
said purchases would be limited, fellow German Juergen Stark has
said they are only a temporary measure.
 The fear is that the bond purchases will increase the amount
of cash in the financial system, leading to higher inflation and
potentially pushing up asset prices.
 But most central bankers stress that mopping up the extra
cash, which generated a flurry of bids from banks keen to
offload funds this week, keeps risks minimal especially when
coupled with a weak economic environment.
 ""Saying that these purchases will trigger inflation makes no
sense,""the monetary source said.
 ""Inflation rose to 1.5 percent due to rising oil prices.
Right now, I see no risk of rising inflation because domestic
demand is weak in several European countries.""
 Austria's Ewald Nowotny said German ""hysteria"" about
inflation was unwarranted and said weak growth was a bigger
problem for the 16-nation region.

 NOT TOO LITTLE, NOT TOO MUCH
 Market participants expect the 16.5 billion euros probably
only covered purchases in the early part of last week, given
trades normally take 2-3 days to settle, but most said it
appeared to be an adequate sum.
 ""16.5 billion euros is not a huge amount in the scheme of
things, if it had been as low as say 5 billion people would have
been wondering whether the ECB was serious, or if it had been as
high as say 50 billion people would have thought the world was
ending,"" Societe Generale economist James Nixon said.
 ECB watchers are generally unconcerned by the difference of
opinion on the Governing Council over the inflation potential
from the buys, noting that it is not the first split.
 There was athree-way divide in June 2008 over whether to
raise interest rates immediately, raise rates later or hold
rates: the conflict was resolved by an unchanged level in June
and a hike of 25 basis points one month later.
This time last year, Weber was heading a camp insisting that
headline rates be cut no lower than 1 percent and rebuffing
calls to buy assets, while Cyprus's Athanasios Orphanides was
urging lower rates and keeping open the door to buying debt.
 In December 2005, after the ECB raised rates for the first
time in more than two years, Weber said he would have preferred
a larger move than the 25 basis points the ECB decided on,
kicking off a slow-but-steady tightening cycle which took rates
from a then-record low of 2 percent to 4 percent in 18 months.
 Policymakers at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of
England, which unlike the ECB publish voting records, also
frequently have diverging views.
 The Fed's Thomas Hoenig has disagreed with the central
bank's vow to keep rates low for an ""extended period"" since
January, concerned that it might fuel asset price bubbles
 BoE members have voted unanimously to keep rates at a record
low since April 2009, but have differed on the amount of asset
purchases. Before then, differences on the size of rate moves --
and even the direction -- were quite common. 
 Deutsche Bank economist Gilles Moec said the ECB did not
appear to be hampered by differing views among policymakers.
 ""At least those concerns did not have any material impact on
the final decision,"" he said. ""Actually I have been surprised
not to see more dissent within the Governing Council in the last
few years because they had to make really bold decisions,
sometimes in a matter of hours.""

 Market talk on potential meetings or action by the European
Central Bank -- or even that Greece would consider leaving the

 The currency rebounded from a four year low reached before
the New York session after Germany's ban on Tuesday of naked
short selling of some securities.
 ""Euro is popping all over as talk is going around that the
ECB may be considering intervention,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""It looked like the Swiss were in earlier, though that
hasn't been confirmed, so we're left to speculate. But the
market is exceptionally short euro, and with it bouncing today,
the wind would be at their back.""
 If anything, the sharp moves higher on Wednesday proved
euro buyers are waiting for a sign that the euro may have
reached a short-term bottom and present a buying opportunity.
 The euro was last up 1.2 percent against the dollar at
$1.2328 EUR=> after going as high as $1.2366. The euro was last
up 1.7 percent against the Swiss franc at 1.4242 Swiss francs
EURCHF=> after going as high as 1.4304 francs.
 The euro had begun to move higher almost as soon as the New
York session began on market rumors of central bank
intervention.
 A source at one of the world's largest foreign exchange
dealers said there was no indication the Swiss National Bank or
any other government institution was behind the jump in
euro/Swiss franc. The move came from ""proprietary accounts"", he
said.
 A European Central Bank spokesman declined to comment on
market rumors of fresh central bank action.

 The ECB's 22-member Governing Council normally meets in
Frankfurt twice a month, with the mid-month meeting typically
dealing with administrative issues rather than monetary policy.
The euro was last up 0.2 percent at 112.46 yen EURJPY=>.
 The currency is still down around 14 percent against the
dollar so far this year, hammered by concerns Europe's debt
problems and austerity measures to combat them could hamper
euro zone economic recovery.
 The initial German announcement of a ban on naked short
sales of the stocks of some German financial institutions and
some euro zone bonds sparked a wave of uncertainty which lifted
the U.S. dollar and yen. Germany banned naked short selling of
euro zone government bonds, some stocks and naked selling of
credit protection backed by sovereign debt. ID:nSGE64I073
 The ban triggered anxiety about whether more regulation
could follow and other countries would follow suit. However, on
Wednesday the head of French financial markets regulator AMF
criticized Germany for its unilateral action and said the
confusion could weaken the euro.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the euro was ""in

 * Strong pillar of alternative investment a necessity
 * Strong gold trend to continue
 
 By Lisa Jucca and Albert Schmieder
 ZURICH, May 19 (Reuters) - Writing off euro zone stocks as
an investment opportunity could be a mistake as the region will
likely outperform even some emerging markets over the next 12
months, Credit Suisse's Chief Investment Officer told Reuters.
 Decisive action by euro zone governments to help Greece
overcome its debt woes earlier this month has helped improve
risk appetite and could curb speculation against the euro.
 And even though uncertainty will prevail in the short term,
the economic growth prospects are good and the weak euro will
boost exports, the top banker told Reuters in an interview.
 ""The euro zone is more attractive compared to other
traditional markets and also emerging markets,"" said Stefan
Keitel, who leads the investment strategy for both the asset
management and private banking arms of Credit Suisse.
 ""Economic improvements are already priced in in the United
States and in emerging markets but not in the euro zone, and we
expect growth rates there to improve with time.""
 ""There is also a currency effect. Having the euro falling 25
cents against the dollar is definitely a stimulus for
export-driven economies like Germany,"" Keitel added.
 Investors eager to hunt bargains should however wait for
market volatility to subside as capital markets have not yet
priced in all Greece-related risks and discussions over a
spillover effect into neighbouring euro zone countries continue.
 ""From a regional point of view it is not the right time to
step right back into euro zone as it will stay tricky over the
next few weeks,"" Keitel said.
 ""But once the negative situation is priced in, we see a high
probability that the euro zone market could be the place to be
for investors for the next 12 months.""
 
 STOCKS MORE ATTRACTIVE
 Keitel said he did not expect a massive trend reversal in
equities markets and added that that equities remained more
attractive than bonds and cash in the current situation.
 But great caution was required and the upside potential was
limited to about 10 percent.
 ""Our advice is to wait for a good buying opportunity over
the next one, two, three months,"" he said. 
 ""The overall cycle is intact and equities can perform well
over the next 12 months. But we are not in a trend market, we
are in a volatile sideways market.""
 Highly volatile equities markets and the somewhat
disappointing performance of fixed-income markets supported the
case for a fair chunk of alternative investments in investors'
portfolios.
 ""Having a strong pillar of roughly 20 percent of
alternatives is a necessity,"" Keitel said.
 Keitel added that he still believed in gold even though the
precious metal has only just reached record highs because of the
fundamental distrust investors attached to the world's three
major currencies: dollar, euro and sterling.
 ""That rising trend is not behind us,"" said Keitel, who said
gold was a personal investment favourite of his.
 ""Gold is very much driven by the currency side, not by the
inflation pendulum swing. It is the structural currency weakness
that drives the gold price,"" he said.
 ""I have been a gold bull since 2003 and we are happy to have
5 percent gold in our portfolios.""

 (Adds details, quotes, byline)
 By John Acher
 COPENHAGEN, May 19 (Reuters) - Denmark's central bank cut
its certificate of deposit rate by 10 basis points to 0.60
percent on Wednesday to curb the crown currency which has
strengthened in the wake of the euro zone debt crisis.
 The bank kept its main rate, the lending rate, steady at
1.05 percent, but it also trimmed its current account rate,
another secondary rate, by 10 bps to 0.50 percent.
 The bank changes interest rates for the sole purpose of
keeping the crown within a narrow band to the euro, but big
inflows of foreign currency into the crown have driven the crown
up in recent months.
 Nordea Markets senior analyst Jan Storup Nielsen said that
the crown's strength was partly a safe-haven effect amid the
turbulence on European financial markets.
 ""The strengthened crown has come because Denmark during the
current debt crisis has got status as a safe haven on the
financial markets because of the...limited deficit in the public
sector, solid surplus in the current account and its relatively
mild gross indebtedness,"" Nielsen said in a note to clients.
 Denmark's foreign exchange reserves fell in April from a
record high level in March, slipping for the first time since
October, and the bank refrained from intervening in the forex
market last month. But recent crown strength has forced the bank
to intervene again, selling crowns for currency to soften it.
 The crown was hardly moved by the rate cut, softening
momentarily to 7.4409 to the euro  from 7.4405 just
before the announcement, but recovering back to flat levels by
1432 GMT.
 The rate cut followed a strengthening of the crown to close
to 7.44 crowns to the euro and even a push through that level on
Friday when Danish banks were closed.

 LARGELY EXPECTED
 EU-member but euro zone outsider Denmark runs a
fixed-exchange-rate policy, which aims to keep the crown within
a plus/minus 2.25 percent fluctuation band around a central rate
of 7.46038 crowns to the euro. In practice the band is tighter.
 It was the 17th cut in the Nationalbank's CD rate since it
began cutting from a peak of 5.50 percent in November 2008,
though it has held the lending rate steady since mid-January
when it took the spread to the euro zone's official rate to a
record narrow 5 basis points.
 Economists had said earlier this week that the bank was
likely to trim secondary rates again soon to ease the crown.
[ID:nLDE64G12H]
 Danske Markets senior forex analyst John Hydeskov, who had
predicted a CD rate reduction would come on Thursday, said the
bank probably chose to move on Wednesday to stem a further
swelling of its foreign exchange reserves.
 ""Today's rate cut in no way needs to be the last,"" Hydeskov
said in a note to clients. ""It is still advantageous to hold
crowns against the euro due to the interest rate pickup assuming
that the European Central Bank keeps rates unchanged -- and that
is the outlook for a long time yet.""
 Handelsbanken chief economist Jes Asmussen said: ""I
wouldn't rule out another CD rate cut.""
 ""Another key lending rate cut is not in our main scenario
but it's not impossible,"" he said. ""7.44 crowns per euro seems
to be the central bank's low acceptance point for the time
being.""
 The rate reduction followed an announcement by Denmark's
centre-right government earlier in the day that it aimed to save
around $4 billion through new budget measures in 2011-2013 as
part of an effort to restore fiscal balance.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro rallied
strongly on speculation related to the European Central Bank on
Wednesday but equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic
remained lower due to Germany's move to ban some naked short
sales of stocks and bonds.
 Despite a 1.0 percent bounce in the euro, assets perceived
as being risky mostly fell in price as concerns that Germany's
move heralded tighter financial regulation, boosting risk
aversion.
 Crude oil slid to $69 a barrel and gold prices shed about 2

 PARIS, May 19 (Reuters) - The head of French financial
markets regulator AMF criticised Germany on Wednesday for its
unilateral action to ban naked short-selling on some instruments
and said the confusion could weaken the euro.
 Jean-Pierre Jouyet, a former minister for European affairs,
told Reuters that Germany took the decision for domestic
political reasons and said France would not copy the move.
 He also called on the European Commission to come up with
its own proposals in order to avoid member nations following
diverging routes.
 ""The euro is a currency that cannot be overlooked and it is
not in danger. It will not be in danger as long as there is an
orderly governance and therefore any confusion will help more to
weaken the euro than to strengthen it,"" he said.
 Jouyet said he had not been informed by his German
counterpart BaFin before the decision was announced on Tuesday.
 ""There have been two conference calls by the CESR (European
regulators) since.... We expressed regret that there was no
European coordination,"" he said by telephone.
 ""We have no intention to follow suit for various reasons,""
he said, adding that in France a ban on naked short-selling of
financial shares had remained in force since the collapse of
Lehman Brothers in 2008.
 As for sovereign debt, the only French listed debt were the
OAT bonds and Jouyet said he saw no reason to impose any
restrictions on this market.
 ""In the framework of our market surveillance, the AMF has
not seen any particular signs, such as problems with settlement
or delivery, that would suggest naked shorts on OATs,"" he said.
 ""We will review our position after the meetings that will
take place in Brussels at the end of the week and on the basis
of what the Commission recommends. I do not believe in the
efficiency of national measures in this area,"" Jouyet said.
 ""Germany took this decision for pure German reasons related
to the economic and political situation in Germany and I can
understand that they needed it in the eyes of the German public
opinion. I have no other comments to make on it.""
 ""We need, as soon as possible, a European financial
regulatory agency with strong powers that includes the
possibility to take urgent action,"" Jouyet said.

 By Holger Hansen and Andreas Rinke
 BERLIN, May 19 (Reuters) - Germany declared war on
speculators on Wednesday, wrongfooting European partners who
said they were not consulted about an overnight ban on naked
short sales of a range of assets that rattled markets.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel told German lawmakers EU leaders
had to ensure markets could not ""extort"" the state any more and
the bloc would introduce its own financial transaction tax or
levy if the Group of 20 nations failed to reach a deal in June.
Merkel urged EU leaders to speed up financial market
supervision and introduce a new tax on them, saying Berlin was
ready to act alone on a ban on activities which some leaders
blame for deepening the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Germany's financial regulator said the ban was ""due to the
extraordinary volatility in government bonds in the euro zone"".
Massive short-selling could have endangered the stability of the
financial system, it said.
 ""I'll boil it down to its core: The euro is the foundation
for growth and prosperity, along with the common market -- also
for Germany. The euro is in danger,"" Merkel told parliament.
 But Germany's European partners were blindsided by the ban.
France and senior EU officials said they had not been consulted
and called for concerted, not unilateral, action.
 ""It seems to me that one ought to at least seek the advice
of the other member states concerned by this measure,"" French
Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said, stressing that Paris
was not considering banning naked short-selling on European
debt.
 The EU commissioner for internal markets and financial
regulation, Michel Barnier, said in a statement the measures
would have been more effective if coordinated at European level.
 ""It is important that member states act together and that we
design a European regime to avoid regulatory arbitrage and
fragmentation both with the EU and globally,"" he said.
 Markets were spooked by the lack of coordination and fears
that Germany's move was in response to a new financial problem.
 Some analysts suggested Germany's ban might be an attempt to
get markets under control before further negative developments
in the euro zone debt crisis -- conceivably even a restructuring
of Greek debt, which officials have so far ruled out.
 Rabobank said Germany's move ""raises the question as to
whether the German regulator knows something the market doesn't.
If there is a secret here, it can't possibly be a positive one.""
 
 FRIDAY TALKS
 EU finance ministers will discuss Germany's ban on Friday,
said EU President Herman van Rompuy, who is to chair meetings on
toughening EU budget rules and improving economic governance.
 Merkel's comment on the euro heaped fresh pressure on the
single currency, which had already tumbled overnight on the back
of Germany's plan to ban naked short-selling of some financial
shares, euro government bonds and related transactions in credit
default swaps (CDS).
 In the United States, where the bulk of credit default swap
trading is done, U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told CNBC
television the history of trading restrictions was ""not good"".
 Credit default swaps insure against the risk of debt
defaults, short selling is a trade that bets a price will fall.
 Naked short selling involves selling a financial instrument
without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can
be borrowed, as would be done in a conventional short sale.
 A German Finance Ministry spokesman said the ban would run
until March 31, 2011. It was not clear how Germany could enforce
it effectively in the debt and CDS markets, which stretch across
national borders.
 
 ""100 PERCENT WRONG""
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said late on
Tuesday Berlin had acted in anticipation of European rules
discussed at a meeting of EU finance ministers earlier in the
day. [ID:nBAT005470]
 ""We said 'We'll go first' because it was precisely that part
of the speculation in the recent months with government bonds in
the euro zone (that) caused us such concern.""
 But a European Commission spokeswoman confirmed EU finance
ministers did not discuss on Tuesday Germany's decision,
announced later that day. [ID:nLDE64I0V1]
 In her speech to lawmakers, Merkel demanded tough action
against ""notorious deficit sinners"" in the euro zone, such as
loss of voting rights, to create an incentive for budget rigour.
 ""Above all, what's necessary is to develop a process for an
orderly state insolvency,"" she said, though she did not refer to
any country by name.
 However, analysts said there were concerns the German ban
would constrict the ability of the markets to be able to manage
risk and hedge positions, causing investors to move out of it.
 ""Rather strangely, Eurocrats have a 'barbarians-at-the-gate'
view of what is going on, that the EMU citadel is under siege
and all resources are needed to repel (them),"" said Stephen Jen
of the BlueGold hedge fund.
 ""I think this view is close to 100 percent off the mark. If
anything ... the biggest sellers of European bonds are European
pension funds, not U.S. hedge funds,"" he said.
 However, Commerzbank CEO Martin Blessing  told
shareholders that short selling and credit default swaps should
be regulated. While they has been a warning light on Greece's
debt, they ""also unnecessarily aggravated the situation, and
even increased the risk of a default"". [nFAB015634]
 The euro -- not covered by the ban -- was the first casualty
of the Germany move, hitting a fresh four-year low before
partially recovering later in the day. [FRX/]

 * Asian carmakers' market share will slump -lobby chief
 * No plans for Asian car plants in Morocco soon
 
 By Lamine Ghanmi
 CASABLANCA, May 19 (Reuters) - Asian carmakers will suffer a
dramatic loss of market share in Morocco from 2012 when European
rivals will benefit from zero import tariffs, a lobby for local
importers of non-European cars said.
 The GIVET trade lobby says Asian carmakers have more than 40
percent of the Moroccan market, which government and industry
groups estimate to be worth about 16.5 billion Moroccan dirhams
($1.83 billion) per year.
 Morocco levies a 37.5 percent import tariff on cars imported
from outside the European Union, against 6.5 percent for cars of
EU origin. The tariffs for European cars will fall to zero from
2012 under a free trade agreement with the EU.
 ""Despite the big difference in tariffs now with European
competitors, Asian cars have more than 40 percent share of the
Moroccan market,"" Adil Bennani, head of GIVET told Reuters.
 ""But with the zero tariffs rate, the situation would be
difficult and our market shares will slump,"" Bennani said in an
interview late on on Tuesday.
 Bennani said his group is urging the Moroccan government to
bring the tariffs gap between Asian cars and their European
rivals down to 10 percent.
 Moroccan Industry and Trade Minister Ahmed Reda Chami said
he understood the concerns of Asian car importers but his
government is bound by the free trade agreement that grants
advantages to their European competitors.
 The government projects strong growth for the automotive
industry in the country on the back of economic growth and a
rising middle class in the main cities.
 It forecasts that car sales will rise to 250,000 per year in
2015 from 100,000 now.
 A government proposal for Asian automotive firms to set up
production inside Morocco is not viable for the near future
because the market is not yet big enough Bennani said.
 Bennani said Asian carmakers were unlikely to follow
France's Renault in building production plants inside Morocco.
 ""Building such factories here is not economically viable
because the market is still relatively small,"" he said.

 PARIS, MAY 19 (REUTERS) - Siemens Enterprise Communications
(SEN), a joint venture between Siemens and U.S. financial
investor Gores Group, aims to more than double its U.S. market
share and is keen to make acquisitions, its top executive said.
 ""Our market share in the U.S. is very small, below 5
percent,"" Chief Executive Hamid Akhavan told the Reuters Global
Technology Summit on Wednesday. SEN specialises in
communications systems for large corporations.
 ""The goal would be to more than double it, a respectable
share has got to reach at least 10 percent,"" Akhavan said but
added that ""if it takes 11 years it might not be worth it but
get it in three, four years that would be massive"".
 Akhavan, a computer engineer by training and previously
chief operating officer at Deutsche Telekom, took the helm at
SEN in mid-February, making him the third CEO in 18 months.
 One of his challenges is to boost SEN's presence in the
United States, dominated by Cisco.
 Akhavan said he was not daunted and viewed the market as a
""a great opportunity"", adding that while SEN lacked recognition
in the United States ""when I get a chance to put a product in
front of customer in a bake off I always win"".
 SEN, which has a strong presence in Europe and Asia, had
hoped to gain a foothold in North America by buying parts of
Canada's Nortel Networks but was outbid by Avaya last year.
 Akhavan said SEN was still pursuing acquisitions.
 ""Acquisition is part of the picture and will be part of the
picture,"" he said.
 SEN had no key deficiencies in its product range that needed
filling so it was not looking to acquire hardware except
possibly in the low end product range, Akhavan said.
 ""We are looking at companies with good relationships with
resellers,"" he said because SEN wants to target more and smaller
companies where its direct service model would not be feasible.
 After major job cuts, SEN has 14,000 employees in around 80
countries.
 It had annual revenues of 3.21 billion euros ($3.99 billion)
in its 2008 fiscal year but has said it will feel the impact of
the global economic slowdown in 2009/2010 with sales shrinking
by 12-15 percent.
 ""The slower spending in Europe and all these worries and
concerns as businesses try to maximise the cost structure has
had and will continue to have an impact,"" Akhavan said.
 This quarter there were signs of a relief but not of a
recovery yet, Akhavan said and added that he does not expect a
recovery later this year either.
 ""We don't sense that the businesses that we deal with are
convinced that the economy is on the recovery path,"" he said.
 However, there was more activity in the United States as
customers were beginning to send RFPs (request for proposals),
asking for quotes and solutions.
 In general the public sector was showing more signs of a
pickup in communications projects than the private sector,
Akhavan said.
 Asked about the effect of the Greek debt crisis Akhavan
said: ""Customers are not paying, essentially having outstanding
debt, so you could certainly tell that there is an impact.""
 The impact of the weakening euro could prove to be an
advantage for SEN.
 ""We run all of our financials in euros but we price in the
local currency. From what we manufacture in Europe, we can be
more competitive in the U.S.,"" Akhavan said.

 * Uncertainty surrounds German naked short-selling ban
 * Investors move on any rumor
 (Adds comment, details, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro rallied strongly
across the board on Wednesday on rumors surrounding the
European Central Bank and the euro, with investors looking for
any news that may show a reversal in the single currency's
fortunes.
 The euro swung from a four-year low against the U.S. dollar
to a session high on Wednesday in volatile trading as investors
debated how a German ban on naked short selling of some
securities will ultimately impact markets.
 Investors reacted to any market rumor whether it be of
intervention in currency markets or of unscheduled meetings by
monetary authorities.
 If anything, the sharp moves proved that euro buyers are
waiting for any sign that the euro may have reached a
short-term bottom and present a buying opportunity.
 ""Euro is popping all over as talk is going around that the
ECB may be considering intervention,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""It looked like the Swiss were in earlier, though that
hasn't been confirmed, so we're left to speculate. But the
market is exceptionally short euro, and with it bouncing today,
the wind would be at their back.""
 The euro was last up 0.9 percent against the dollar at
$1.2289  after going as high as $1.2328. The euro was
last up 0.9 percent against the Swiss franc at 1.4134 Swiss
francs  after going as high as 1.4201 francs.
 A source at one of the world's largest foreign exchange
dealers said there was no indication the Swiss National Bank or
any other government institution behind the jump in euro/Swiss
franc. The move came from ""proprietary accounts"", he said.
 A European Central Bank spokesman declined comment on
market rumours of fresh central bank action, which are driving
up the euro.
 ECB policymakers are due to gather in Frankfurt later on
Wednesday as usual ahead of their regular Thursday meeting
after the laying of a foundation stone for the ECB's new
premises. [ID:nLDE64I1RE]
 The ECB's 22-member Governing Council normally meets in
Frankfurt twice a month, with the mid-month meeting typically
dealing with administrative issues rather than monetary policy.
 The euro was last up 0.5 percent at 112.72 yen .
 The initial German announcement of a ban on naked short
sales of the stocks of some German financial institutions and
some euro zone bonds sparked a wave of uncertainty which lifted
the U.S. dollar and yen. Germany banned naked short selling of
euro zone government bonds, some stocks and naked selling of
credit protection backed by sovereign debt. [ID:nSGE64I073]
 The ban triggered anxiety about whether more regulation
could follow and other countries would follow suit.
 Comments by German Chancellor Angela Merkel that the euro
was ""in danger"" further undermined confidence in the single
currency. [ID:nLDE64I0Z1]
 The knee-jerk reaction to sell the currency was based on
the assumption that selling the currency was the only way to
bet against European assets, given the limitations placed on
selling bonds and some equities.
 But as the New York session began, euro selling reversed
with more and more buyers stepping in.
 ""Given the degree of (the euro's) fall over the past few
days and yesterday's sharp tumble and the overnight tumble, I
think at this point a short bounce might be in order as
investors step back and take a breather and really assess the
longer-term impact of Germany's ban on certain types of trading
strategies."" said Joe Manimbo, market analyst, Travelex Global

 That move stopped ahead of key technical support at

the euro from all time lows near $0.82 to the record highs just
above $1.60.
 Traders said option barriers at $1.22 were taken out and
more were lined up at $1.21, $1.20 and right down to $1.15.
 The euro is still down around 14 percent against the dollar
so far this year, hammered by concerns Europe's debt problems
and austerity measures to combat them could hamper the euro
zone's economic recovery.
 The euro also fell to a record low against the Swiss franc
 below 1.4000 francs on electronic trading platform

National Bank's new intervention threshold.

speculators, stunning investors with a ban on naked short
selling of certain financial instruments and wrongfooting its
European partners who said they were not consulted.
 France said it would not follow suit and the European
Commission pleaded for a coordinated approach. Chancellor Angela
Merkel put the euro under more pressure by declaring it was in
danger.
 Following are a selection of views from industry figures and
analysts:
 
 COMMERZBANK CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARTIN BLESSING
 Said there was a clear need to regulate short selling and
credit default swaps.
""Besides the ban on naked short selling, I am thinking
particularly of credit default swaps,"" he said.
 Such financial instruments can serve as a warning light.
 ""On the other hand, they also unnecessarily aggravated the
situation, and even increased the risk of a default.""
 
 ANTHONY BELCHAMBERS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF FUTURES AND OPTIONS
ASSOCIATION
 ""This is going to result in hopeless confusion in the
financial services sector. It makes the whole role of market
functionality and compliance difficult to fulfil.""
 
 SIMON TILFORD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN REFORM,
 ""It again suggests that the Germans are no closer to
understanding that the markets are not the problem here. The
markets are right to be uncertain about the sustainability of
the euro zone in its current form.
 ""What is specific to Germany is a readiness to make
unilateral announcements on things that would only be doable if
they were done collectively.
 ""It's pretty populist stuff. It's very difficult to imagine
the French doing something like this, making this sort of
unilateral decision.""
 
 STEPHEN JEN OF BLUEGOLD HEDGE FUND
 ""Rather strangely, Eurocrats have a 'barbarians-at-the-gate'
view of what is going on, that the EMU citadel is under siege
and all resources are needed to repel the antagonists/atheists
whose cruelness is only matched by their ignorance.
 ""I think this view is close to 100 percent off the mark. If
anything ... the biggest sellers of European bonds are European
pension funds, not U.S. hedge funds.""
 JEREMY STRETCH, CURRENCY STRATEGIST RABOBANK
 ""Politicians have failed to appreciate that careless talk
costs the performance of the single currency.""
 
 BOB POZEN, CHAIRMAN OF MFS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
 ""These are understandable reactions by the government but
they are unfortunate and ineffective ... It's a very blunt
instrument that doesn't make any sense.""
 
 MARK CHANDLER, GLOBAL HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, BROWN BROTHERS
HARRIMAN
 ""Market participants concluded that the move was ill-thought
out, uncoordinated, and likely ineffective.
 ""This would seem to be yet another case of a European
government taking the wrong fork in the road.""
 
 STUART BENNETT, CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT CREDIT AGRICOLE
 ""The German announcement came out of the blue, without
warning, and there is major uncertainty about what this means,
whether others will follow and how they will maintain this.
 ""The backdrop is a very neurotic market which is inclined to
give any euro-related news a negative spin.""

 By Felix Bate
 MADRID, May 19 (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers
will discuss Germany's short-selling ban and coordination of
such market-moving decisions in the EU on Friday, European Union
President Herman Van Rompuy said on Wednesday.
 Germany did not consult on its decision late on Tuesday to
introduce a ban on some short-selling of bonds, stocks and
transactions in credit default swaps with its EU peers.
 The move has pulled the rug from under the euro currency
 which is shared by 16 countries.
 ""Close cooperation in the EU on all issues which have a
strong market impact is very important and needs to be
strengthened,"" Van Rompuy told a news conference in Madrid.
 ""I intend to raise this matter at the meeting of the task
force (EU ministers) that I will chair this Friday,"" he said. 
 EU finance ministers -- the Task Force -- meet on May 21 in
Brussels to come up with proposals on how to toughen EU budget
rules and improve economic governance so as to avoid a repeat of
the Greek debt crisis.
 ""We will discuss this topic and other topics starting from
Friday,"" Van Rompuy said.
 ""We will have an intermediate report for the European
Council (EU leaders' summit) in the middle of June and we will
finalise our work for the European Council in October,"" he said.
 Germany has announced a ban with immediate effect on naked
short-selling of euro zone government bonds and in shares of the
country's 10 leading financial institutions. 
 It also banned naked transactions of credit default swaps
(CDS) linked to euro government debt.
 German financial watchdog, BaFin, said the bans were ""due to
the extraordinary volatility in government bonds in the euro
zone"". It said massive short-selling could have endangered the
stability of the financial system.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told the
news conference in Madrid that actions by other national
authorities, coordinated at European level, would reinforce the
German move and value and weight to it.
 ""The Commission is today inviting the Committee of European
Securities Regulators to quickly examine whether the conditions
that led German authorities to this conclusion are also relevant
elsewhere in Europe,"" Barroso said.
 He also said the Commission, the EU executive arm, was
completing a detailed investigation into what has been happening
on sovereign bond markets and would accelerate work on measures
to address naked short-selling issues where the parties have no
interest in the underlying assets.
 ""The Commission will come with a formal proposal as soon as
we have gathered the necessary evidence,"" Barroso said.

 * Iran has flourished under past sanctions - minister
 * Analyst says Iran resilient but Iranians fear for economy
 
 By Robin Pomeroy
 TEHRAN, May 19 (Reuters) - Iran's leaders say they have
nothing to fear from a renewed push for U.N. sanctions and hope
the move will convince Iranians of Western hostility rather than
add to increasing fears for the major oil producer's economy.
 Washington's announcement on Tuesday of a new sanctions
draft backed by China and Russia came a day after Iran agreed a
uranium swap with Brazil and Turkey, aimed at outmanoeuvring
Western efforts to sanction Iran over its nuclear programme.
 As Iranian TV replayed two-day-old pictures of President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad holding aloft the hands of Brazil's
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Turkish Prime Minister
Tayyip Erdogan, officials played up their deal and dismissed the
significance of the sanctions threat that swiftly followed.
 Ahmadinejad's senior adviser said the sanctions draft had
""no legitimacy at all"", while Foreign Minister Manouchehr
Mottaki said there was no chance that a new round of sanctions
would be approved by the U.N. Security Council.
 The head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation said the
renewed sanctions threat would be seen in the developing world
as a bullying attempt by the big powers, and he hoped the
measures could still be avoided.
 ""They (Western countries) invalidate themselves in the view
of public opinion by issuing sanctions,"" Ali Akbar Salehi told
reporters. ""There are some wise people among them to avoid doing
such irrational actions.""
 But with the new restrictions on Iranian banks and other
industries looking ever closer, politicians moved to reassure
Iranians they would have no more impact that existing sanctions
which had failed to cripple the economy.
 ""Despite all the restrictions that the arrogant countries
impose on Iran in the global arena, the Islamic Republic has
significant successes in political and economic fields,"" Energy
Minister Majid Namjou was quoted as saying by ILNA news agency.
 
 RESILIENCE
 Ebrahim Hosseini-Nasab, economics professor at Tehran's
Tarbiat Modares University, also played down the impact of
sanctions on the economy.
 ""Iranian policy makers have learned from experience how to
deal with these sanctions,"" he said. ""The Iranian economy has
always had a great deal of resilience ... I don't believe it
will have any crippling effect on the Iranian economy.""
 But Morteza Masoumzadeh, a shipping line executive and vice
president of the Iranian Business Council in Dubai, a transit
route for many Iranian imports, said sanctions had hurt.
 ""The sanctions clearly have affected our business and
already our business is down by 70 percent compared to three
years ago,"" Masoumzadeh told Reuters in Dubai.
 U.S. sanctions imposed in 2007 targeting two Iranian banks
with branches in Dubai had been particularly painful, he said.
But that did not mean new U.N. measures would make things worse.
 ""The sanctions have already hit us so I don't think anything
of this nature will hit us further,"" he said.
 Ali Ansari, an Iran expert at St Andrews University in
Scotland, said the new sanctions could have a psychological
impact and, if properly targeted, could hinder the powerful
Revolutionary Guards, the elite military force which has become
a major economic player.
 ""However, I have always felt that the sanctions will be a
minor irritant as compared the Ahmadinejad government's own
mismanagement of the economy and the lifting of subsidies,""
Ansari told Reuters.
 That plan -- to stop huge subsidies on fuel and food and
replace them with cash handouts for the less well-off -- will
begin in September and will be a huge economic and political
test for Ahmadinejad who was re-elected last June despite a
popular opposition movement which complained of vote rigging.
 Nastaran, a 29-year-old computer engineer in Tehran, said
she hoped the new sanctions could be introduced without hurting
the people.
 ""The West should impose sanctions that put pressure on
Iran's government instead of ordinary people,"" she said. ""In
this way the government would have no choice but to change its
policies or hand over the country.""

1073,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2010 08:44AM ET</span>",Q+A-How will Germany's short selling ban impact markets?," By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Germany banned naked
short-selling of certain financial instruments on Wednesday,
sending the euro and European shares lower and raising concerns
over market liquidity.
 German financial watchdog BaFin said the ban had been
imposed ""due to the extraordinary volatility in government bonds
in the euro zone"" and warned that massive short selling could
have endangered the stability of the financial system.
 Here are some of the key issues raised:
 
 WHAT EXACTLY IS COVERED BY THE BAN?
 Germany banned naked short selling of euro zone government
bonds and shares in 10 leading German financial institutions, as
well as transactions in credit default swaps (CDS) linked to
euro government bonds. The ban took effect from midnight and
will run through March 31, 2011.
 Short selling is a trade that bets a price will fall. Naked
short selling is when a trader sells a financial instrument
without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can
be borrowed.
 
 WHAT DOES THE BAN AIM TO DO?
 Large short positions typically push the price of the
securities lower and the ban is seen as aiming to limit pressure
on euro zone peripheral economies such as Greece, Portugal and
Spain.
 Greece has required a 110 billion euro ($137 billion)
emergency loan from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund. Yet some analysts have also voiced concern that
the ban could be aimed at heading off a problem in the pipeline
of which financial markets are not yet aware.
 Analysts say it is unclear whether the ban will work and
that it could backfire on Germany if other financial centres do
not follow suit.
 
 WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT ON MARKET LIQUIDITY AND WHY?
 Market liquidity has been affected by Berlin's solo effort
to drive away speculators as the move sparked concern other
countries might introduce similar measures.
 Data provider Markit said that uncertainty has created
""febrile"" conditions in the CDS market, resulting in low
liquidity and high volatility.
 Corporates and financials with peripheral exposure have
underperformed markedly, ""indicating that the market is becoming
more wary of a peripheral sovereign default,"" Markit said.
 Investors tend to cut positions in riskier assets in such a
high volatile market conditions.
 
 HOW BIG IS NAKED SHORT SELLING OR SHORT SELLING IN THESE
ASSETS?
 The ban will be applied to institutions operating under
German securities watchdog BaFin, though it will not include
branches of German firms outside the country.
 Analysts and traders say the bulk of short selling is being
done in New York and London, but added that it was difficult to
quantify how much of it was naked.
 For example, Data Explorers, which tracks the amount of
stock out on loan to give an indication of how much ""shorting""
of a stock there is, said Commerzbank is the only stock of the
10 German financial firms subject to the ban on naked short
selling where investors held a significant short position.
 It said 5.1 percent of Commerzbank stock was out on loan at
Monday's close, while only 1 percent of Deutsche Bank was out on
loan, and the amount on loans for all the other eight stocks was
under 2 percent.
 It did not specify the proportion of such trades which were
naked short sales.
 
 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THIS WILL HEAD OFF PRESSURE ON EURO
PERIPHERAL BONDS AND SOVEREIGN CDS?
 Premium investors demand to hold 10-year Greek government
bonds rather than German benchmark Bunds rose on Wednesday but
this trend was not necessarily expected to be sustained or
driven by the ban.
 The confusion in European markets, even as investors sought
safe havens, saw U.S. Treasuries outperform German debt and this
could turn into a more sustainable move.
 The ban has also put pressure on the euro, which was viewed
as a key target for betting against European assets for
investors who find themselves unable to short sell bonds or
equities, analysts said.
 The euro fell to a fresh four-year low against the dollar,
while European shares fell more than 2 percent by midday on
Wednesday. Shares in most of Germany's financial companies were
weaker.
 
 HOW SUSTAINED WILL THE MARKET REACTION BE?
 In the medium to long run, the clampdown will be bad for
Bunds as it takes away the ability of investors to hedge their
positions through buying German government bonds and shorting
bonds in other peripheral economies, according to Sean Maloney,
bond strategist at Nomura.
 The impact of the ban on liquidity and market conditions
will also crucially depend on whether other countries -- and
which ones -- take a similar line. If big financial centres,
such as London and New York, have different rules, there will
always be ways to circumvent the ban.
 
 HOW CAN INVESTORS GET AROUND THE BAN?
 Numerous ideas have emerged about how traders and investors
could translate their negative views on the assets subject to
the German ban into action without falling foul of the BaFin
rules. These include:
 1) Carry on shorting euro government bonds, sovereign CDS in
New York and London as the ban only applies to institutions
operating under German securities watchdog BaFin.
 2) Buy CDS in senior German financials or indexes such as
iTraxx Main.
 3) Sell DAX exchange traded funds and buy non-financial
German stocks, as German exporters are likely to benefit from a
weaker euro.
 4) Sell something else correlated to the banned instruments,
such as European bank stocks

 * ""Range of views"" on price pressures and spare capacity
 * UK fiscal outlook, euro zone woes add to uncertainty

(Adds BoE numerical economic forecasts)
 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee voted unanimously to make no changes to its
ultra-loose policy stance this month, but some members thought
the Bank's latest inflation forecast was overly optimistic.
 Minutes of the central bank's May 7-10 meeting showed there
was ""a range of views"" among MPC members regarding the amount of
spare capacity in the economy and how much it could reduce
inflation.
 Although economic data had evolved broadly as the MPC
expected over the past three months, May's decision was framed
by uncertainty stemming from developments in the euro zone and
the unclear path of Britain's fiscal tightening.
 The MPC met just after Britain's inconclusive May 6
election, and before a coalition was formed between the
Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, which have since
pledged to accelerate the pace of fiscal tightening.
 ""It was too early to assess with confidence the overall
impact of recent developments on the medium-term outlook. Some
of the present uncertainties should be reduced by the time of
future meetings,"" the BoE said.
 BoE members voted 9-0 to keep interest rates at 0.5 percent,
where they have been since March 2009, and to maintain the 200
billion pound stock of assets purchased under the Bank's
quantitative easing policy.
 The minutes noted that near-term inflation prospects had
risen -- a view also shown in the May 12 Inflation Report -- but
that spare capacity should continue to reduce price pressures in
the medium term, despite some signs they were currently rising.
 Detailed Inflation Report figures released for the first
time on Wednesday showed the BoE had revised up its forecast for
Q4 inflation to a modal 2.28 percent from February's 1.53
percent forecast, assuming monetary policy stays unchanged.
 A year later, inflation is forecast to have bottomed out
around 1.49 percent compared to 1.44 percent in the February
Inflation Report.
 However, some MPC members said at the last meeting that
these forecasts were too optimistic.
 ""Some members interpreted recent developments in firms'
costs and pricing behaviour as potentially suggesting that the
dampening effect on inflation from the margin of spare capacity
might be somewhat weaker than assumed in the May central
projection,"" the minutes said.
 Consumer price inflation unexpectedly hit a 17-month high of
3.7 percent in April, figures released on Tuesday showed,
forcing BoE Governor Mervyn King to write a public letter
explaining why CPI had stayed so far above its 2 percent target
for so long.
 
 DOWNSIDE RISKS
 Other MPC members placed more weight on downside risks to
growth and inflation from the continued reluctance of banks to
lend and financial turmoil in the euro zone.
 The latest Inflation Report sees modal year-on-year growth
of 2.80 percent by the last three months of 2010, little changed
from the February forecast.
 Economists saw little that was surprising in the minutes,
but noted the ongoing tussle on the 9-member committee about the
impact of spare capacity, which the central bank is relying on
to bring down inflation without the need for interest rate
rises.
 ""There's still evidence of divisions,"" said Ross Walker,
economist at RBS. ""They're nuancing a little bit this output gap
analysis, which clearly they've got to do in the light of
inflation data, but overall there's still a slightly dovish bias
there.""
 Money markets show that most investors do not expect the BoE
to raise interest rates before early 2011.
 At the time of the MPC meeting, committee members said it
was too early to tell how big an impact tensions on euro zone
government debt markets would have on Britain's economy, since
it was possible that the creation a $1 trillion EU/IMF bailout
fund could restore market confidence.
 ""The only lasting effect of recent developments on UK
economic prospects could come about from accelerated fiscal
adjustment in the euro area,"" the minutes stated.
 The BoE said that as of May 10, the pace of fiscal
consolidation in Britain was uncertain and ""would need to be
sensitive to sustaining market confidence"".
 King welcomed the coalition's plans to reduce the budget
deficit faster in a news conference on May 12.

 * IMF:Japan should gradually increase consumption tax
 * Country should start fiscal reform in 2011
 * Japan recovery gaining momentum, deflation to end late 2011
 TOKYO, May 19 (Reuters) - Japan should start fiscal
consolidation next year, including gradually raising the
country's sales tax, taking advantage of solid growth now, the
IMF said on Wednesday.
 The recommendation by the International Monetary Fund
contradicts Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's pledge not to raise
the sales tax rate at least until the next lower house election,
which does not need to be held until 2013.
 ""With global scrutiny of public finances increasing, the need
for early and credible fiscal adjustment has become critical,""
the IMF said after its annual review of Japan's economy and
economic policies.
 ""In our view, fiscal adjustment should start in 2011/12,
beginning with a gradual increase in the consumption tax, to take
advantage of cyclical recovery,"" the IMF said.
 Japan's outstanding debt as a ratio of gross domestic product
is the highest among industrial nations.
 Investors are on edge over countries with large debt burdens
after a crisis of confidence in Greece's fiscal policy roiled
financial markets and prompted the European Union to roll out a
$1 trillion rescue package to defend the falling euro.
 Some market players think Japan could become the next target
of markets, although many market players think the country can
muddle through at least in the near future because of huge
domestic savings.
 ""Our assessment is that there's limited risk of any kind of
sovereign debt event (in Japan). But no matter how small the risk
is, it must be a bit higher as a result of recent events. That
suggests a need for early action. The fact that the economy is
showing strength now shows it is a propitious time to begin
adjustment,"" an official at the IMF said.
 The IMF said the Japanese recovery is gaining momentum and
that prices in the country will start rising in late 2011.
 GDP data due on Thursday is expected to show the economy grew
an annualised 5.4 percent in the first months of this year.
 The IMF also said the BOJ's easing steps have helped
stabilise financial markets and support the economy.
 But it added the BOJ could consider additional easing
measures such as extending the maturity of the central bank's
fund-supplying operations.

 (Adds more quotes, details)
 VILNIUS, May 19 (Reuters) - Lithuania needs to make further
spending cuts over the coming years to bring its budget deficit
in line with rules for euro zone entry, the head of the
International Monetary Fund's mission there said on Wednesday.
 Catriona Purfield, the head of the IMF mission to Lithuania,
said the IMF may revise its forecast for Lithuania's economy to
fall 1.6 percent this year after a better-than- expected
first-quarter result. The economy contracted 2.9 per cent
year-on-year in Q1, a better performance than analysts forecast.
""That gives us hopes that the economy is turning around more
quickly,"" Purfield told Reuters on the sidelines of a
conference, adding that recovery will depend on exports.
 Lithuania was among the worst hit by the crisis in the
European Union with its economy shrinking by 14.8 percent last
year and the public sector deficit expanding to 8.9 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP).
 ""Lithuania needs further fiscal adjustment of 5.5 percent of
GDP to the end-2012 if it wants to cut the deficit to 3 percent
of GDP,"" Purfield said.
 ""If no further fiscal adjustments are made, Lithuania's
deficit will remain at 8-9 percent of GDP, similar to Greece.""
 Lithuania aims to join the euro zone in 2014.
 Lithuania's finance ministry recently cut its outlook on
2011 growth to 2.8 percent from an earlier forecast of 3.2
percent, but kept its forecast for 2010 of 1.6 percent growth
unchanged.
 The country's central bank is less optimistic with a
forecast of 0.5 percent for 2010, and said recently it saw
downside risks.
 ""The economy started to pick up in the second half of last
year, but no signs of sustainable recovery are seen yet,""
Reinoldijus Sarkinas, the central bank governor told a
conference, attended by the IMF mission head.

 * France says won't follow suit, EU not consulted
 * Euro hits another four-year low, shares sag 
 * EU Commission calls for European coordination
 
 By Holger Hansen and Andreas Rinke
 BERLIN, May 19 (Reuters) - Germany declared war on
speculators on Wednesday, stunning investors with a ban on naked
short selling of certain financial instruments and wrongfooting
its European partners who said they were not consulted.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel urged the European Union to speed
up financial market supervision and introduce a new tax on them,
saying Berlin was ready to act alone on a ban on activities
which some leaders blame for much of the euro zone debt crisis.
 Speaking to parliament after the ban came into force at
midnight (2200 GMT Tuesday), Merkel said EU leaders had to
ensure markets could not ""extort"" the state any more and the
bloc would introduce its own financial transaction tax or levy
if the Group of 20 nations failed to reach a deal in June.
 ""I'll boil it down to its core: The euro is the foundation
for growth and prosperity, along with the common market -- also
for Germany. The euro is in danger,"" she told parliament.
 Her comment heaped fresh pressure on the euro which had
already tumbled on the back of Germany's plan to ban naked
short-selling of shares in the top 10 German financial
institutions, euro government bonds and on related transactions
in credit default swaps (CDS).
 Short selling is a trade that bets a price will fall. Naked
short selling is when a trader sells a financial instrument
without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can
be borrowed, as would be done in a conventional short sale.
 
 EU PARTNERS LEFT IN DARK
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble defended the move
late on Tuesday, saying Berlin had acted in anticipation of
European rules discussed at a meeting of EU finance ministers
earlier in the day.
 ""We said 'We'll go first' because it was precisely that part
of the speculation in the recent months with government bonds in
the euro zone caused us such concern.""
 But France said on Wednesday it was not considering banning
naked short-selling on European debt and said it had not been
consulted.
 ""It seems to me that one ought to at least seek the advice
of the other member states concerned by this measure,"" Economy
Minister Christine Lagarde said.
 A European Commission spokeswoman confirmed EU finance
ministers did not discuss on Tuesday Germany's decision later
that day.
 The EU commissioner for internal markets and financial
regulation, Michel Barnier, said in a statement: ""These measures
will be even more efficient if they are coordinated at European
level.
 ""It is important that member states act together and that we
design a European regime to avoid regulatory arbitrage and
fragmentation both with the EU and globally.""
 He said Germany's moves against derivatives should be
discussed at a finance ministers' meeting on Friday.
 Britain's regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA)
noted the German ban and said it would assist the German
authorities where appropriate but added it would not cover
German institutions outside Germany or in Britain.
 
 ""100 PERCENT WRONG""
 Analysts said the German decision could do more harm than
good, draining funds away from the euro zone and deepening risk
aversion. Some called it an act of desperation. 
 ""Rather strangely, Eurocrats have a 'barbarians-at-the-gate'
view of what is going on, that the EMU citadel is under siege
and all resources are needed to repel the antagonists/atheists
whose cruelness is only matched by their ignorance,"" said
Stephen Jen of the BlueGold hedge fund.
 ""I think this view is close to 100 percent off the mark. If
anything ... the biggest sellers of European bonds are European
pension funds, not U.S. hedge funds,"" he said.
 Germany's lack of coordination with other euro zone members
underscored how the measures may unsettle, rather than calm,
markets already nervous about the debt crisis.
 ""Germany's announcement ... dented risk appetite as it
raises the question as to whether the German regulator knows
something the market doesn't,"" Rabobank said in a note. ""If
there is a secret here, it can't possibly be a positive one."" 
 The euro -- not covered by the ban -- was the first casualty
of the move, hitting a fresh four-year low.
 
 MARKETS RATTLED
 The clampdown announced by Europe's biggest economy hit
markets hard. The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 2.4 percent at 0945
GMT, and most major European indices fell.
 Naked short selling of euro-denominated government bonds and
shares in Germany's 10 leading financial institutions, as well
as related transactions in credit default swaps, will be
prohibited until March 31, 2011, a spokesman for the German
finance ministry said. 
 Credit default swaps, a type of derivative known as CDS,
insure against the risk of debt defaults.
 Germany's financial regulator said the move was ""due to the
extraordinary volatility in government bonds in the euro zone"".
Massive short-selling could have endangered the stability of the
financial system, it said. 
 It was not clear how Germany could enforce the ban
effectively in the debt and CDS markets, which stretch across
national borders.
 U.S. regulators are working on their own rules to curb stock
trading when markets plunge uncontrollably, as happened on May 6
when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped some 700 points
within minutes. 
 The plan was hastily crafted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and major U.S. exchanges and will be implemented as
soon as mid-June, a source familiar with the plan told Reuters.

 By Paul Carrel and Erik Kirschbaum
 BERLIN, May 19 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Markel,
spooking investors on Wednesday by saying the euro was in
danger, urged speedy action to stop market ""extortion"" and said
the EU needed a process for ""orderly"" insolvency of members.
 Recommending tough moves against ""notorious deficit sinners""
in the euro zone, such as withdrawing voting rights, the German
leader told parliament in Berlin: ""Above all, what's necessary
is to develop a process for an orderly state insolvency.
 ""With that we would create an important incentive for euro
zone member states to keep their budgets in order.""
 Germany shocked financial markets on Tuesday by taking an
apparently unilateral initiative involving an immediate ban on
naked short-selling of euro government bonds and on related
transactions in credit default swaps (CDS). The country's
financial regulator also banned naked short sales of shares in
Germany's 10 leading financial institutions.
 European shares fell in response and German bunds soared as
rattled investors sought refuge in safe-haven assets.
[ID:nLDE64I0A3] [ID:nLDE64I0OM]
 Short selling is a trade that bets the price of an asset
will fall, while the naked variant of the practice involves a
trader selling a financial instrument without first borrowing
the asset or ensuring that it can be borrowed, as would be done
in a conventional short sale.
 ""In those areas where unilateral action by Germany won't
cause any harm, we will also act on our own,"" Merkel said.
 It was not immediately clear whether Germany's overnight ban
was taken in consultation with euro zone partners. Austria said
it wanted to discuss an Europe-wide measure at a meeting of EU
finance ministers on Friday. [IDnSGE64I06R]
 
 RISKS OF MEASURES
 Euro zone leaders, who last week tried to calm markets with
a 750 billion euro ($930 billion) emergency debt package, are
also likely to push for an EU-wide tax on financial transactions
to help cover the cost of the debt crisis triggered by Greece.
 Some officials and economists say such a tax only makes
sense if it is introduced globally, though Merkel said the EU
would do it unilaterally if the Group of 20 nations failed to
reach such an agreement at their summit in June .
 ""The introduction of a financial transaction tax only makes
sense if it is introduced on a global basis, which doesn't
seem very likely. Otherwise we see a risk investors will go to
tax-free countries,"" said Equinet analyst Philipp Haessler.
 Some analysts said Germany's move against short-selling
would have little impact in itself, since most such trade take
place in London and New York -- but they warned it could send a
negative message to markets already shaken by the Greek crisis.
 ""It's once more about the timing, which is silly, as
investors will assume that the sovereign debt crisis is far away
from being over,"" said analyst Heino Ruland, predicting that it
would continue to weigh on the euro.
 David Keeble, global head of rates strategy at Credit
Agricole in London, said the initial strong reaction to the
German measures on the share and debt market looked overblown.
 ""We think that the impact will be quite moderate and
certainly not warranting the massive reaction in equities and
bond futures seen overnight,"" he said.
 ""It appears that (German) market makers have been excluded
from the regulations so if a customer comes and asks for an
offer, the market maker can sell them without worrying about
covering the position.""
 Commerzbank  CEO Martin Blessing said it was the
kind of regulation needed to put an end to ""exorbitant
speculation"" and recommended it be extended to a broader range
of credit default swaps, which he said aggravated the Greek
crisis.
 The euro  fell over half a U.S. cent from the day's
high at $1.2228 to $1.2145 on the German chancellor's comments
after the short-selling ban hit sentiment in Asia.
 ""I'll boil it down to its core: The euro is the foundation
for growth and prosperity, along with the common market -- also
for Germany. The euro is in danger,"" said Merkel.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2010 05:20AM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-BoE unanimous on May policy, split on CPI outlook"," * BoE May MPC decision unanimous, as expected
 * ""Range of views"" on price pressures and spare capacity
 * UK fiscal outlook, euro zone woes add to uncertainty
 
 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee voted unanimously to make no changes to its
ultra-loose policy stance this month, but some members thought
the Bank's latest inflation forecast was too optimistic.
 Minutes of the central bank's May 7-10 meeting showed there
was ""a range of views"" among MPC members regarding the margin of
spare capacity and the strength of its influence on inflation.
 Although economic data had evolved broadly as the MPC
expected over the past three months, May's decision was framed
by uncertainty stemming from developments in the euro zone and
the unclear path of Britain's fiscal tightening.
 The MPC met just after Britain's inconclusive May 6
election, and before a coalition was formed between the
Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties, which have since
pledged to accelerate the pace of fiscal tightening.
 ""It was too early to assess with confidence the overall
impact of recent developments on the medium-term outlook. Some
of the present uncertainties should be reduced by the time of
future meetings,"" the minutes said.
 BoE members voted 9-0 to keep interest rates at 0.5 percent,
where they have been since March 2009, and to maintain the 200
billion pound stock of assets purchased under the Bank's
quantitative easing policy.
 The minutes noted that near-term inflation prospects had
risen -- a view also shown in the May 12 Inflation Report -- but
that spare capacity should continue to reduce price pressures in
the medium term, despite some signs they were currently rising.
 ""Some members interpreted recent developments in firms'
costs and pricing behaviour as potentially suggesting that the
dampening effect on inflation from the margin of spare capacity
might be somewhat weaker than assumed in the May central
projection,"" the minutes said.
 Consumer price inflation unexpectedly hit a 17-month high of
3.7 percent in April, figures released on Tuesday showed,
forcing BoE Governor Mervyn King to write a public letter
explaining why CPI had stayed so far above its 2 percent target
for so long.
 Other MPC members placed more weight on downside risks to
growth and inflation from the continued reluctance of banks to
lend and financial turmoil in the euro zone.
 Economists saw little that was surprising in the minutes,
but noted an ongoing tussle on the 9-member committee about the
impact of spare capacity, which the central bank is relying on
to bring down inflation without the need for interest rate
rises.
 ""There's still evidence of divisions,"" said Ross Walker,
economist at RBS. ""They're nuancing a little bit this output gap
analysis, which clearly they've got to do in the light of
inflation data, but overall there's still a slightly dovish bias
there.""
 Money markets show that most investors do not expect the BoE
to raise interest rates before early 2011.
 At the time of the MPC meeting, committee members said it
was too early to tell how big an impact tensions on euro zone
government debt markets would have on Britain's economy, since
it was possible that the creation a $1 trillion EU/IMF bailout
fund could restore market confidence.
 ""The only lasting effect of recent developments on UK
economic prospects could come about from accelerated fiscal
adjustment in the euro area,"" the minutes stated.
 The BoE said that as of May 10, the pace of fiscal
consolidation in Britain was uncertain and ""would need to be
sensitive to sustaining market confidence"".
 King welcomed the coalition's plans to reduce the budget
deficit faster in a news conference on May 12.

 * Crisis has cut potential growth, budget/tax reform needed
 
 (Adds more detail, comments)
 BUDAPEST, May 19 (Reuters) - Hungary should join the euro
zone ""in the foreseeable future"" but adoption must be rooted in
sustainable economic policies and growth, the central bank said
on Wednesday.
 ""Overall, at present we believe that the adoption of the
euro is at least as desirable from the aspect of the Hungarian
economy as it was prior to the crisis,"" the bank said in a
report on convergence.
 ""The stability of the economy as well as external and fiscal
sustainability will have to be demonstrated well before the
adoption of the euro, even for joining ERM-2.""
 Hungary has no euro adoption target date at the moment and
meets none of the Maastricht criteria of euro zone membership.
Analysts expect Hungary to adopt the euro in 2015.
 ""With regard to timing, we think that setting a credible
target date for the adoption of the euro may take place based on
stable fundamentals, especially on clear results attained in the
fields of price stability and fiscal discipline,"" the bank said.
 Central bank Governor Andras Simor told a news conference
after the release of the report that the crisis has reduced the
country's potential GDP growth rate to 2.5 percent from 3.2
percent prior to the crisis, under the bank's baseline scenario.
 Under a worse scenario, the potential growth rate could be
even lower at 2.1 percent, requiring Hungary to continue reforms
by cutting taxes on labour, enhancing labour supply and
maintaining disciplined fiscal policies to boost economic growth
and make it sustainable.
 
 LARGER DEFICIT CUTS NEEDED
 A lesson of the crisis was that the country should cut its
budget deficit even below levels required for euro zone entry so
as to create room for fiscal policy to tackle crisis situations,
the bank said.
 ""This crisis has only shown that for a country like ours,
the introduction of the euro has become more desirable rather
than less desirable,"" Simor added.
 But it is very difficult to see now how fast potential
growth will be in the coming years, where the interest rate
level will be and the real exchange rate at which it will be
reasonable to join the euro zone, he said.
 The bank said in the report that Hungary should address the
structural weaknesses of the budget and reform the expenditure
side, in addition to maintaining fiscal balance.
 It also said that lowering the general tax level can only be
achieved by reducing government redistribution.
 Sustainable economic and budget policy is all the more
necessary as there are growing signs that in the future European
union institutions will very closely monitor whether a country
has met the Maastricht convergence criteria, the bank said.
 The bank reiterated that it expected to meet its 3 percent
medium-term inflation target next year.
 ""Maintaining the low inflation environment, however, poses
another challenge to monetary policy,"" it said.
 ""If expectations become unanchored, there is a significant
risk that inflation will increase as the economic recovery
gathers pace.""
 Annual headline inflation was running at 5.7 percent in
April. The bank's key base rate is at an all-time low of 5.25
percent and analysts expect more easing to come.

 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Fears of greater financial
regulation across Europe hammered stocks and buoyed core euro
zone bonds on Wednesday after German measures aimed at limiting
speculation were taken to smack of desperation.
 Wall Street, troubled by progress in U.S. financial
regulatory reform, looked set to open lower.
 Stock markets were unnerved by Germany's unilateral ban on
certain naked shorts announced late on Tuesday. And the euro
suffered a kneejerk reaction, falling more than 1 percent
against the yen, as investors saw foreign exchange as the only
way to bet against the euro zone. 
 World stocks as measured by the MSCI All-Country index
<.MIWD00000PUS> were down 1.43 percent whilst the more volatile
emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> fell 2.64 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
tumbled 2.20 percent, with banks and commodity stocks the
hardest hit.
 The index, which gained nearly 26 percent in 2009, is now
down 4.31 percent for the year amid persistent concerns about
the euro zone's debt problems.
 There were also fears that the debt crisis was about to
worsen as some believed Germany's move smacked of desperation.
 ""Investors are somewhat spooked,"" said Stephen Pope, chief
global equity strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""The worry is
whether other markets will try and copy."" 
 Germany banned naked short selling of shares in its 10 most
important financial institutions, euro-denominated government
bonds and credit default swaps based on those bonds. Naked short
selling is when an investor sells shares without borrowing them
first or ensuring they can be borrowed. [ID:nN18512882]
 German Bunds soared and the premium that investors demand to
hold 10-year Greek government bonds rather than German benchmark
Bunds rose as investors sought safe havens, although some
analysts said the market reaction was overdone. 
 Markets fretted that Germany's moves would be adopted by
other European regulators, but France denied it was considering
doing so and said it had not been consulted. [ID:nPAB008358]

 EURO UNDER PRESSURE
 The euro  was also put under pressure after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said the currency was in danger in a
speech to parliament in which she urged the European Union to
speed up financial market supervision. [ID:nBAT005475]
 The struggling currency fell more than 1 percent on the day
versus the yen, as the low-yielding Japanese currency rose
broadly on risk aversion. 
 Against the dollar it struggled up from fresh four-year lows
hit in early Asian trade to $1.221, but was still down 14.76
percent year to date.
 ""The reaction in the euro is due to all the uncertainty that
this brings -- there have been fiscal problems, liquidity
problems and now there is regulation on top of that,"" said Niels

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a four-year low
against the dollar on Wednesday after Germany banned naked
short-selling of some securities, while comments by the German
chancellor further undermined confidence in the currency.
 Germany announced late on Tuesday a ban on some high-risk
bets involving euro-denominated government bonds, credit default
swaps based on those bonds, and shares in Germany's 10 top
financial institutions.
 Analysts said that if investors could not respond to the
euro zone debt crisis by selling bonds or equities, the euro was
the only option for betting against European assets. This added
to the already shaky sentiment towards the currency.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel said the euro was ""in danger"",
sparking concerns that Germany was panicking about the steep
fall in the single currency.
 ""If Merkel (makes) comments in the wake of short selling,
Germans are really frightened of the situation,"" said Jeremy
Stretch, currency strategist at Rabobank.
 The ban triggered a fresh wave of risk aversion on anxiety
about whether more regulation could follow, and prompted
concerns about a lack of solidarity among European countries in
tackling the euro zone debt crisis.
 At 0817 GMT, the euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.2177. In
early Asian trade, it slid as low as $1.2143 on trading platform
EBS, its lowest since April 2006.
 Traders said option barriers at $1.22 were taken out and
more were lined up at $1.21, $1.20 and right down to $1.15.
 They said the euro's next support was at $1.2133, a 50
percent retracement from its all-time low of $0.8225 hit in
October 2000 to its record peak of $1.6040 reached on EBS in
July 2008.

 WIDER BAN?
 A fresh wave of risk aversion lifted the U.S. dollar to a
14-month high of 87.458 against a basket of currencies while the
euro also fell to a record low versus the Swiss franc.
 Traders said Germany's move limits risks players can take in
euro assets, encouraging investors to shift funds elsewhere. A
wider ban would only spur the outflow of money from the euro
zone, putting further pressure on the single currency.
 Investors are now waiting to see whether other countries
will follow Germany as a wider ban could squeeze liquidity in
euro zone markets. The Financial Times reported that Austria's
finance ministry was pushing for a Europe-wide ban of naked
short-selling of some financial stocks and debt securities.
 The euro has fallen about 15 percent against the dollar so
far this year, hammered by concerns Europe's debt problems and
austerity measures to combat it could hamper the euro zone's
economic recovery.
 ""The reaction in the euro is due to all the uncertainty that
this brings - there have been fiscal problems, liquidity
problems and now there is regulation on top of that,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 The euro fell to a record low against the Swiss franc below
1.4000 francs before steadying just above that level, which
traders said was seen as the Swiss National Bank's new
intervention threshold.
 Data showed Swiss currency reserves soared in April,
evidence of just how much the SNB has had to do to prevent a
sharp franc appreciation versus the troubled single currency.

 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, May 19 (Reuters) - Germany's decision to ban naked
short selling will add to selling pressure on the euro, although
Tokyo is unlikely to intervene in the market to stem a resulting
rise in the yen, a former Bank of Japan board member said.
 Germany, in an attack on the financial speculation on which
it blames much of the euro zone's debt crisis, announced on
Tuesday a ban on naked short sales of euro-denominated government
bonds, credit default swaps based on those bonds, and shares in
Germany's 10 leading financial institutions.
 Former BOJ board member Atsushi Mizuno said tighter
regulation in Germany was negative for the euro, which will
remain under downward pressure against the yen.
 ""Downward pressure on the euro will likely heighten,"" Mizuno
told a seminar on Wednesday. ""The yen has been bought, and the
risk of a further yen rise remains.""
 But Mizuno said Japanese authorities were unlikely to step
into the market to halt yen rises against the euro.
 ""I don't think there will be action by authorities. This is
not something Japan can take control of,"" Mizuno said.
 The euro fell to its lowest in more than four years against
the dollar on Wednesday as a sell-off in the single currency
gathered pace after Germany's move to ban naked short-selling.
 Mizuno, who sat on the BOJ board until last December, is
currently vice chairman of Credit Suisse's fixed-income business
in the Asia-Pacific region.
 Naked short selling is when a trader sells short a financial
instrument he does not possess, betting that its price will fall,
without first borrowing the instrument or confirming if it can be
borrowed.

(Adds quotes, background)
 BERLIN, May 19 (Reuters) - Euro zone states must cut their
deficits to win the confidence of financial markets, which
remain sceptical about the currency area's fiscal health,
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Wednesday.
 ""We haven't really convinced the markets yet, as we have
seen the euro falling further. That means we must reduce
deficits in all euro zone member states,"" Schaeuble told
Deutschlandfunk radio.
 Asked about remarks by Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef
Ackermann that cast doubt on Greece's ability to repay its

to make.""
 ""Of course we expect every country to pay back its debts.
So far Greece has also paid back every debt,"" he added.
 Schaeuble said Germany would only introduce a financial
transaction tax if it could be agreed globally and the chances
of that happening were slim.
 ""If it can be agreed globally, then we can do it but
whether there can be a global agreement ... we will see at the
G20 summit of government leaders in June in Canada,"" he said.
""The chances of there being such an agreement are very slim.""
 Instead, Germany is pushing for the introduction of a bank
levy.
 Asked whether his recent health troubles had led him to
consider resigning, Schaeuble said: ""No.""
 ""I think I can undertake and bear this responsibility,"" he
added.
 Schaeuble, 67, has used a wheelchair since he was shot and
nearly killed by a mentally ill man in 1990.
 He has been in and out of hospital several times and
recently missed international meetings in Madrid, Washington
and Brussels due to healing complications following an
operation earlier in the year.

 * German ban on naked short sales makes players cautious
(Adds more comment)
 By Masayuki Kitano and Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, May 19 (Reuters) - Germany's decision to ban naked
short sales of euro-denominated government bonds is prompting
some Japanese brokers to avoid selling European debt during Asian
trading hours, market players said on Wednesday.
 ""For today the situation is that it's hard for us to take
orders on European bonds,"" said Yasutoshi Nagai, chief economist
at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets. ""For clients looking to buy,
we are asking them to buy Treasuries,"" he said.
 Uncertainty about the details of Germany's ban on naked short
selling was making brokers cautious and came as a headache for
some Japanese investors, market players said.
 ""Since we don't trade in Tokyo hours, our company has not
been hurt, but some players such asset management companies which
do trade in Tokyo are believed to be getting hurt by this
situation,"" said a senior manager of foreign bond investment at a
major Japanese life insurer.
 Germany, in an attack on the financial speculation on which
it blames much of the euro zone's debt crisis, announced on
Tuesday a ban on naked short sales of euro-denominated government
bonds, credit default swaps based on those bonds, and shares in
Germany's 10 leading financial institutions.
 Naked short selling is when a trader sells short a financial
instrument he does not possess, betting that its price will fall,
without first borrowing the instrument or confirming if it can be
borrowed.
 ""What I have heard is that during Tokyo trading hours,
brokerages cannot give prices for trades that would involve
selling (of European bonds) by the brokerages,"" said Junji
Kojima, senior deputy general manager at Sompo Japan Insurance's
global securities investment department.
 Kojima said he had heard that such steps were being taken by
more than one Japanese brokerage house.
 The brokers apparently want to avoid taking orders to sell to
investors European bonds that they do not have in their
inventories, Kojima said, adding that the situation was likely to
normalise once European markets open.
 ""Once we get into London trading hours, there probably won't
be any problems since they would be able to procure them from the
market,"" Kojima said.
 But not all were convinced that the situation would normalise
quite so quickly.
 ""The brokerage firms are saying they cannot give prices
because they are not sure about what exactly a 'naked' position
is. It is probably inevitable that there will be market
turbulence on such confusion once the London market opens,"" said
the senior manager of foreign bond investment at a major Japanese
life insurer.

imbalance
 * U.S. trade deficit with China needs to come down
(Adds comments, background on the dialogue)
 By Doug Palmer
 SHANGHAI, May 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Gary Locke urged China on Wednesday to purchase more American
goods to help reduce a huge trade imbalance that has caused
friction in U.S.-Sino ties.
 ""Obviously the trade deficit needs to come down,"" Locke
told Reuters in an interview ahead of a high-level U.S.-China
Dialogue on economic and foreign policy concerns early next
week in Beijing.
 ""There's two component to it: more exports from the United
States to China and more internal consumption within China so
that they're less reliant on exports,"" Locke said.
 The former Washington state governor said he believed the
turbulent economic events of the past several years, including
most recently in Europe, has persuaded Chinese leaders they
need to find a new model for economic growth.
 ""They recognise that their economy cannot become so export
dependent, especially with the crisis within the EU. That's
also a major destination for Chinese products,"" he said.
 The U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $226.8 billion in
2009, down more than $40 billion from 2008 but still the
largest the United States has with any country.
 The huge imbalance has fueled accusations in the U.S.
Congress and manufacturing sector that China is manipulating
its currency for an unfair trade advantage by keeping the price
of its yuan artificially low against the dollar.
 U.S. officials have said those concerns will be on the
agenda at the two-day U.S.-China Strategic and Economic
Dialogue meeting starting on Monday.
 Locke is leading a delegation of 24 U.S. companies on a
clean energy trade mission to China.
 A primary purpose is to help meet President Barack Obama's
goal of doubling overall U.S. exports within five years.
 Locke stopped short of setting an individual goal of
doubling U.S. exports to China.
 But China's push to boost its use of renewable energy and
to increase building efficiency offers big opportunities in
areas where U.S. companies have a lot to offer, he said.
 In some cases, it makes more sense for U.S. companies to
build factories in China, than to ship the goods from the
United States, Locke said.
 But U.S. company investment in Chinese manufacturing
facilities also supports U.S. jobs since many of the components
that go into final goods produced in China are made in the
United States, he said.
 The United States also welcomes Chinese investment in the
U.S. manufacturing sector, which helps create jobs in the
United States, Locke said.
 ""That's been a theme of the United States, with respect to
all countries,"" he said.
 U.S. companies had more than $45 billion invested in China
as of 2008, but Chinese investment in the United States remains
far below that.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2010 01:03AM ET</span>","UPDATE 1-Sudden yuan rise unlikely, ex-HKMA chief says"," By Kevin Lim
 SINGAPORE, May 19 (Reuters) - Expectations China will
unshackle the yuan from a dollar peg soon and allow the
currency to enjoy a sharp one-off gain are misguided, the
former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on
Wednesday.
 Joseph Yam, now an adviser to China's central bank, said
speculators betting on a yuan  appreciation via
non-deliverable forwards (NDF) could lose a lot of money.
 It was not in China's interest to relax the peg anytime
soon given the uncertainty in European financial markets, he
said.
 Yam was the head of the HKMA from 1993 until his retirement
last year. He is now an adviser to the People's Bank of China
as an executive vice president of the China Society for Finance
and Banking, a research institution under the central bank.
 ""Contrary to market expectations, I think there is unlikely
to be a large one-off appreciation of the renminbi against the
U.S. dollar when exchange rate flexibility is reintroduced,"" he
said.
 Commenting on financial market speculation that Beijing
will soon relax its peg to the dollar, he said: ""That is yet
another example of the dark side of financial innovation.""
 Beijing is under international pressure to let its currency
rise now that the worst of the global financial crisis appears
to have passed.
 It pegged the currency at 6.83 per dollar since the middle
of 2008 to help the export-geared economy through the global
downturn.
 Advising investors to focus on economic factors rather than
political rhetoric, Yam said Chinese policy between July 2005
and March 2008 was to allow a gradual 2-3 percent appreciation
of the yuan versus a currency basket, rather than against the
dollar.
 Should China resume its stated policy, ""it would actually
require a significant depreciation in the renminbi exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar,"" Yam said at an investment
conference in Singapore, pointing to the dollar's recent rise
against the euro.
 The euro has fallen about 15 percent against the dollar so
far this year and is down a fifth since mid 2008. The dollar
index, which measures the dollar against six major currencies,
has risen 19 percent since mid 2008.
 Yam added that it was debatable whether the yuan was
undervalued, pointing to China's trade surplus, which shrank by
30 percent last year.
 Yam said the recent intensification of pressure on China to
relax its currency peg could be linked to the large number of
bets for a rising yuan via the NDF market that need to be
settled soon.
 ""I have personally very little sympathy for those losing
bets,"" he said.

 By Raju Gopalakrishnan
 SINGAPORE, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro  fell to a
fresh four-year low on Wednesday after a German move to sharpen
financial regulation raised doubts about the prospect for
global recovery, pulling down Asian stocks, metals and crude
oil.
 The U.S. dollar index rose to a 14-month high as investors
sought safer havens for their cash, including in the yen and
U.S. Treasuries.
 European stock markets were seen falling sharply at the
open. They had closed on Tuesday before Germany announced its
unilateral ban on speculative selling of some securities.
 The move, coupled with strengthening financial regulation
in the United States, roiled financial markets as investors
stampeded out of riskier assets and worries spread that the
global economic recovery could be derailed.
 Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> was expected to open as much as
1.6 percent lower, financial bookmakers said.By 0601 GMT, stock
futures for the STOXX Europe 50 , Germany's DAX 
and France's CAC-40  had dropped 1.1 to 2.2 percent.
 ""If you combine this new regulation in Germany with all the
other negative headlines we've been having in the past few
days, most probably European markets will react negatively,""
said Pierre Faddoul, a credit analyst at Aberdeen Asset
Management in Singapore.
 Germany said it was banning naked short sales of
euro-denominated government bonds, credit default swaps based
on those bonds, and shares in Germany's 10 leading financial
institutions.
 In naked short selling, a trader sells a financial
instrument short, betting that its price will fall, without
first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can be
borrowed, as would be done in a conventional short sale.
[ID:nN18512882]
 Germany's lack of coordination with any other countries,
including euro zone members, underscored how the measures may
backfire and so unsettle, rather than calm, markets already
nervous about the debt crisis, analysts said.
 ""Germany just switched off the financial lights in Europe,""
said a senior forex trader at a European bank in Singapore.
 The euro fell as low as $1.2143 on trading platform EBS,
its weakest level since April 2006 and taking it losses so far
in 2010 to more than 15 percent.
 It later recovered to around $1.2208, but the bounce could
be short-lived.
 ""Stocks and CDS trading are now regulated. The government
bond market is supported by the European Central Bank's buying.
So investors have no place but the currency market to express
their views on Europe,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist Japan at Barclays Capital.
 DOLLAR, YEN BENEFIT
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> dropped over 2 percent to a three-month low. It
has fallen about 4.3 percent since the start of the week.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> fell as much as 1.8 percent,
also to a three-month low, on the regulation worries and as the
weak euro dragged on exporters. It later recovered but still
closed down on the day by 0.5 percent for its weakest finish in
11 weeks.
 High-yielding currencies like the Australian and New
Zealand dollars   also fell as investors reduced
their exposure to riskier investments.
 ""Under other circumstances, the naked short selling ban is
actually a move that might be taken positively by markets,""
said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a strategist at Okasan Securities.
 ""What markets really wanted to hear from authorities,
especially in Europe, was some sort of statement strongly in
support of the euro framework. Instead, there was this -- and
the disappointment set off selling.""
 The Australian dollar  fell to an eight-month low
of $0.854, with charts suggesting more losses as investors
dumped high-yielding currencies. The kiwi  was down 0.6
percent at $0.6854
 Australian shares <.AXJO> also hit an eight-month low.
 Industrial metals fell as fears of tighter regulations
threw doubts on hopes for a global economic recovery.
 London three-month copper  dropped $135 to $6,565 a
tonne, or over 2 percent. Zinc prices in Shanghai  fell
more than 5 percent, while London nickel  dropped 4.7
percent on the fall in the euro.
 Crude oil futures slid to a seven-month low ,
reflecting falls in other markets.
 The flight to assets perceived as safer bets in time of
uncertainty boosted the dollar and the yen.
 The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit's performance
against a basket of major currencies, rose to a 14-month high
of 87.458 <.DXY> before slipping back to 87.135.
 Treasuries also rose during Asia time. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year note  eased to 3.33 percent from
3.49 percent late on Monday.
 Gold initially gained on a safe-haven bid, but then fell
back on fears of a correction. Spot gold  hit an intraday
high of $1,227.10 an ounce before falling to $1209.20 by 0524
GMT, down $10.50 from New York's notional close on Tuesday.
 It struck a record of $1,248.95 an ounce on Friday on fears
that euro zone austerity measures could impede, rather than
aid, a recovery, but analysts say the market may be technically
overbought.

1093,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2010 11:52PM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-Volcker: Europe's debt crisis shows risks for U.S," (Refiles to fix formal name of Fox Business Network)
* Volcker says U.S. budget problems raise questions
* Says $1 trillion rescue shows commitment to euro
* Volcker calls fluctuations in euro ""excessive""
 By Jim Christie
 STANFORD, Calif., May 18 (Reuters) - Europe's debt crisis
shows the risks for the United States if it does not get its
budget deficits under control, former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker said on Tuesday.
 ""If we need any further illustration of the potential
threats to our own economy from uncontrolled borrowing, we have
only to look to the struggle to maintain the common European
currency, to rebalance the European economy, and to sustain
political cohesion of Europe,"" Volcker said.
 Volcker, a special adviser to President Barack Obama, said
many well-developed economies were becoming aware of the
hazards of running ""unprecedented levels of public debts"" as
they emerge from the global recession.
 The U.S. budget deficit hit $1.4 trillion in 2009, roughly
10 percent of the economy. The White House projects the deficit
this year will reach $1.6 trillion.
 The large deficits have evoked comparisons to Greece.
 But in a speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic
Policy Research in California, Volcker said the United States
differs from that country and other small European countries
whose credit markets have come under speculative attack.
 Unlike those countries, the United States benefits from
well-established currency and credit markets that are
considered safe havens in times of financial turmoil.
 Still, Volcker said there are lessons for the United States
in Europe's woes and he warned of the need to address long-term
budget problems, such as the expected growth in social programs
as the U.S. population ages.
 ""There are serious questions, most immediately about the
sustainability of our commitment to growing entitlement
programs,"" said Volcker, who heads an outside panel of experts
advising Obama on the economy.
 ECONOMIC RECESSION
 Volcker, who conquered runaway inflation during the 1980s
through interest-rate increases that pushed the U.S. economy
into a recession, said the $1 trillion rescue aimed at quelling
the European debt crisis did not take away the need for
countries to accept tough medicine.
 ""Financing can buy time, but not indefinite time. The
underlying hard fiscal and economic adjustments are necessary,""
he said.
 In a pair of interviews before the speech, Volcker said the
crisis posed a major test for the euro but said the rescue
underscored a commitment to the currency.
 In an interview with Fox Business Network, Volcker said, ""I
think what is going on in Greece is obviously a challenge to
the euro and to the success of the euro.""
 But he added that Europe has ""shown a determination to keep
this together.""
 In London last week, Volcker said that Europe's debt
troubles had led him to worry about the future of the
currency.
 Asked in the Fox interview whether parity with the dollar
was where the euro was headed, Volcker noted there had been a
lot of ups and downs in the currency.
 ""I think these fluctuations, frankly, are excessive,"" he
said.
 Volcker, speaking in a separate interview with Bloomberg
radio, described the European rescue package as ""breathtaking""
in size.
 He disagreed with critics of the European Central Bank who
believe its role in the rescue might compromise its
independence. ""I don't think they've lost any credibility in
the process,"" he said.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro fell to its lowest in more
than four years against the dollar on Wednesday as a sell-off in
the single currency picked up pace after Germany's move to ban
naked short-selling of some securities rattled investors.
 Germany on Tuesday announced a ban that covered some
high-risk bets of euro-denominated government bonds, credit
default swaps based on those bonds, and shares in Germany's 10
top financial institutions.
 Analysts said that Germany's regulation would do little to
help fix Europe's debt crisis, and that the ban has left foreign
exchange as the only market where investors fell free to bet
against European assets.
 ""Stocks and CDS trading are now regulated. The government
bond market is supported by the European Central Bank's buying.
So investors have no place but the currency market to express
their views on Europe,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist Japan at Barclays Capital.
 Meanwhile, the dollar and the yen benefitted as players
sought the safety of the greenback, the world's most liquid
currency, and the low-yielding Japanese currency.
 The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit's performance
against a basket of major currencies, rose to a 14-month high of
87.458.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.2184. In early Asian
trade, it slid as low as $1.2143 on trading platform EBS, its
lowest since April 2006.
 ""Germany's ban of naked short-selling, which limits
risk-taking in euro assets, will only prompt investors to shift
their funds elsewhere,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the
foreign securities department at Okasan Securities.
 Traders said option barriers at $1.22 were taken out and more
are lined up at $1.21, $1.20 and right down to $1.15.
 The euro's next support is seen at $1.2133, a 50 percent
retracement from its all-time low of $0.8225 hit in October 2000
to its record peak of $1.6040 reached in July 2008.
 If that level is broken, the next support level would be at
the psychologically important $1.2000.
 The euro has fallen 15 percent against the dollar so far this
year, hammered by concerns that Europe's debt problems and
austerity measures could hamper the euro zone's economic
recovery.
 Against the Japanese currency, the euro slid 0.6 percent to
111.91 yen, crawling towards an eight-year low of 110.49 yen
struck earlier this month.
 The yen rose across the board, lifted by investor risk
aversion moves. The higher-yielding Australian dollar dropped 1
percent to 78.53 yen.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 91.85 yen.
 Sterling fell as low as $1.4239, its lowest since late March
2009. The pound is under pressure on concerns that potential
monetary tightening, added to imminent fiscal tightening, may
derail the economy's recovery.

 SHANGHAI, May 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Gary Locke urged China on Wednesday to purchase more American
goods to help reduce a huge trade imbalance that has caused

 ""Obviously the trade deficit needs to come down,"" Locke

need to find a new model for economic growth.
 ""They recognise that their economy cannot become so export
dependent, especially with the crisis within the EU. That's
also a major destination for Chinese products,"" he said.
 The U.S. trade deficit with China totaled $226.8 billion in
2009, down more than $40 billion from 2008 but still the
largest the United States has with any country.
 The huge imbalance has fueled accusations in the U.S.
Congress and manufacturing sector that China is manipulating
its currency for an unfair trade advantage by keeping the price
of its yuan artificially low against the dollar.
 U.S. officials have said those concerns will be on the
agenda at the two-day U.S.-China Strategic and Economic
Dialogue meeting starting on Monday.
 Asked at a news briefing if he thought the crisis in Europe
had changed the environment for the talks by making China more
wary of revaluing its yuan currency, Locke said: ""I'm sure it
cannot be ignored.""
 ""I think it means perhaps a greater urgency that the two
countries talk about economic policy and the way that we can
move forward on rebalancing our economies,"" he told reporters.
 ""So, I think it's even better that we're meeting at this
time,"" he added.
 MARKET ECONOMY
 Locke, who is in Shanghai leading 24 U.S. companies on a
clean energy trade mission, declined further comment on the
yuan, saying that was the jurisdiction of U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner.
 A primary purpose of the mission is to help meet President
Barack Obama's goal of doubling overall U.S. exports within
five years.
 He was also asked when the United States would designate
China as a ""market economy"", as it did several years ago for
Russia.
 Locke said that depended on when China met a strict set of
criteria under U.S. law and did not give any specific
timeframe.
 China resents not being considered a market economy by the
United States, which affects how Washington calculates any
anti-dumping duties it imposes on Chinese exports.
 Locke stopped short of setting an individual goal of
doubling U.S. exports to China.
 But China's push to boost its use of renewable energy and
to increase building efficiency offers big opportunities in
areas where U.S. companies have a lot to offer, he said.
 In some cases, it makes more sense for U.S. companies to
build factories in China, than to ship the goods from the
United States, Locke said.
 But U.S. company investment in Chinese manufacturing
facilities also supports U.S. jobs since many of the components
that go into final goods produced in China are made in the
United States, he said.
 The United States also welcomes Chinese investment in the
U.S. manufacturing sector, which helps create jobs in the
United States, Locke said.
 ""That's been a theme of the United States, with respect to
all countries,"" he said.
 U.S. companies had more than $45 billion invested in China
as of 2008, but Chinese investment in the United States remains
far below that.

 WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - Europe's $1 trillion
economic rescue signals a recognition of the threat to the euro
currency and a commitment to defending it, former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said on Tuesday.
 Volcker, a special adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama,
said in London last week that Europe's debt troubles had led
him to worry about the future of the currency.
 In an interview in California with Fox Business News,
Volcker said, ""I think what is going on in Greece is obviously
a challenge to the euro and to the success of the euro.""
 But he added that Europe has ""shown a determination to keep
this together.""
 Asked whether parity with the dollar was where the euro was
headed, Volcker noted there had been a lot of ups and downs in
the currency.
 ""I think these fluctuations, frankly, are excessive,"" he
said.
 Turning to the U.S. economy, he said he was not worried
about inflation but warned it could become a problem in the
future and that the big budget deficit added to the risks.
 ""We are running a big deficit,"" Volcker said. ""We've been
too consumption oriented, too little investment oriented, too
little export oriented. Those are huge challenges.""

 * Researcher says now is the time to reform currency
(Adds CASS researcher in paragraphs 7 to 11)
 BEIJING, May 19 (Reuters) - China's yuan reform must aim to
counter expectations of appreciation and fend off speculators, a
government institute said in a report published on Wednesday.
 China needs to increase the flexibility of the yuan's
exchange rate to prevent its rise from being a one-way bet, the
Chinese Academy of Governance said in a report published in the
official China Securities Journal on Wednesday.
 The academy, which trains government officials, said that
Beijing should step up efforts to increase imports to reduce its
trade surplus, thereby alleviating short-term pressure for yuan
appreciation.
 But the report said the key was for the government to widen
the range within which the yuan floats to introduce more
volatility in the exchange rate and deter hot money inflows.
 The yuan is currently allowed to rise or fall 0.5 percent
from a daily reference rate set by the central bank. Some
analysts have said that band might be widened to 1 percent as
part of long-anticipated exchange rate reform.
 Beijing is facing international calls to let the yuan return
to a path of appreciation after effectively repegging the
currency at about 6.83 to the dollar to help its exporters ride
out the global credit crunch.
 Zhang Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS), a top government think-tank, said there was an
excellent window now to increase yuan flexibility, with
international attention focused on Greece's debt woes.
 The debt worries were leading to a climate of risk aversion
in global markets, which would weigh against much-feared
speculative inflows after any appreciation, Zhang said in a
research report issued on Wednesday.
 He also said that China's domestic economic developments had
lowered market expectations about how much appreciation was
needed, preventing the yuan's rise from being a one-way bet.
 A narrower trade surplus and cheaper global commodities
reduced the urgency of a stronger yuan in the market's eyes, he
said.
 And the government's property tightening campaign and a
sluggish stock market would combine to dull the charm of Chinese
assets for foreign speculators, he added.

 ""In April, the growth in exports to Europe still stood at 25

 The impact, mainly from the fluctuation in the euro, is
likely to hurt electronic and mechanic equipment makers, because
their exports make up for more than half of the total volume, Huo

 WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - The European debt crisis
poses a big test for the euro currency and the economies hit by
the problems face a long, difficult road to recovery, former
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said on Tuesday.
 Volcker, a special adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama,
told Bloomberg radio in an interview that fiscal austerity
could not be avoided for smaller European countries under
speculative attack.
 But Volcker said that if growth picks up in larger
economies such as Germany and France, that would ease the
struggles for European countries forced to slash their
budgets.
 ""Obviously, it would help a lot if the rest of Europe, the
strong part of Europe ... if they have more growth, that will
help these countries on the periphery,"" Volcker said.
 He said the smaller countries have no choice other than to
pursue fiscal austerity, along with reforms that will make
their economies more competitive.
 ""That's a process that's going to take years,"" Volcker
said.
 ""This is a big test for the euro. There is no question
about it because some countries -- some of the smaller, weaker
economies -- have gotten out of touch with equilibrium in the
system and it's forcing adjustments.""
 Asked whether a ""race to the bottom"" devaluation of the
euro or British pound would help the problem, Volcker replied:
""I do not think so.""
 Volcker said past experience showed that a deliberate
pursuit of a cheaper currency could lead to inflation and
instability rather than healthy growth.
 Volcker called the $1 trillion European rescue plan
""breathtaking"" in size. He disagreed with critics of the
European Central Bank who believe its role in the rescue might
compromise its independence.
 ""I don't think they've lost any credibility in the
process,"" he said.

 TOKYO, May 19 (Reuters) - The euro hit a four-year low
against the dollar on Wednesday after Germany's move to ban naked
short-selling of some securities rattled investors.
 Germany on Tuesday announced a ban that covered some
high-risk bets of euro-denominated government bonds, credit
default swaps based on those bonds, and shares in Germany's 10
top financial institutions.
 Market participants said Germany's regulation would do little
to help fix Europe's debt crisis and would turn investor

on the euro zone as a whole.
 ""Germany's ban of naked short-selling, which limits
risk-taking in euro assets, will only prompt investors to shift
their funds to elsewhere,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of
the foreign securities department at Okasan Securities.

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a four-year
lows on Tuesday and U.S. stocks sank more than 1 percent on
worries that tighter financial regulation stretching from Wall
Street to Frankfurt will hinder a global economic recovery.
 The price of crude oil fell to a seven-month low, hurt by
the stronger U.S. dollar and as investors' aversion to risk
increased on rising fears that a new chapter could unfold in
the European debt crisis. U.S. Treasury prices rose on the
flight to safety.
 Germany, in an attack on the financial speculation on which
it blames much of the euro zone's debt crisis, announced a ban
beginning at midnight on naked short-selling in shares of the
country's 10 most important financial institutions, as well as
in some euro zone government debt and trading in credit default
swaps on that debt. See [ID:nN18512882].
 The euro fell to to $1.2161  ,the lowest level since
April 2006 after the ban was announced, which traders said
increased uncertainty in the financial markets.
 ""This announcement by the German government has given the
view to the market that perhaps there's another problem in
Europe,"" said John Brady, a senior vice president at MF Global
in Chicago.
 Brady noted that Greece's debt problems had been exposed
only after a new government took office. ""Now with Germany
doing this, there's a belief that there may be another problem
in Europe that has yet to be uncovered.""
 U.S. stocks were also pressured by proposed new rules from
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and financial
exchanges to curb trading when markets plunge. The proposal
follows the roughly 700-point drop in the Dow industrials in a
matter of minutes on May 6. For details see [ID:nN18223624]
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 113.59 points,
or 1.07 percent, at 10,512.24. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> closed down 16.07 points, or 1.41 percent, at 1,120.87,
while the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 36.80 points,
or 1.56 percent, at 2,317.43.
 Financial stocks led the way down, with the S&P financial
index <.GSPF> falling 2.8 percent. JPMorgan Chase & Co 
was down 2.1 percent at $39.00.
 Shares of technology companies, which tend to rely heavily
on overseas sales, were also among the biggest losers. An index
of semiconductor shares <.SOXX> lost 2.9 percent, while Intel
Corp  dropped 2.7 percent to $21.43.
 Germany said the ban on some naked short selling will run
through March 31, 2011. In naked short selling, a trader sells
a financial instrument short, betting that its price will fall,
without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring that it can
be borrowed, as would be done in a conventional short sale.
 ""Germany decided it was going to ban naked short selling.
So if you want to express your view but can't sell European
equities or bonds, your only choice is to sell the currency and
take your money elsewhere,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior
currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 The euro  fell 1.51 percent at $1.2206 from a
previous session close of $1.2393.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  fell 0.26
percent at 92.34.
 ""The announcement in Germany was aimed at limiting
intra-day market volatility but saw the euro extending its
declines,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, at Wells Fargo in New
York. ""The proof is always in the markets.""
 The German ban came on the same day as European Union
finance ministers voted through the draft text on tighter
regulation of hedge funds and private equity firms.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose
31/32, with the yield at 3.37 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury
note  rose 3/32, with the yield at 0.745 percent,
while the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  gained 60/32,
with the yield at 4.25 percent.
 Crude oil  prices settled down 67 cents, or 0.96
percent, to $69.37 per barrel, and spot gold prices  fell
70 cents, or 0.06 percent, to $1,222.00.
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB> rose 1.73 points, or
0.68 percent, at 254.93.
 Ahead of the news from Germany, the FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of top European shares closed up 1.3 percent at
1,026.64 points. The gains snapped two consecutive days of
declines, and came after Greece received funds from the
European Union to repay its immediate debt. Banks rebounded and

 * Senators urge Geithner to ask Beijing to release report
 * IMF said to have called yuan ""substantially undervalued""
(Recasts, adds details, comment from former IMF official)
 By David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - A group of ten U.S. senators
accused China on Tuesday of suppressing an International
Monetary Fund report that they believe concluded that Bejing
manipulates its yuan currency to gain an unfair export
advantage.
 The senators urged top Obama administration officials to
put pressure on their Chinese counterparts to release the IMF
report during a U.S.-China economic summit in Beijing next
week.
 In a letter to letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner, the lawmakers said that China had surpressed
publication of the staff report from the IMF's annual
consultation with China last summer.
 Such staff reports contain assessments of a country's
currency policies, but IMF member states can decide whether or
not to release them.
 ""This report could be the smoking gun that confirms that
China has been intentionally manipulating its currency to gain
an unfair trade advantage,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York
Democrat, said in a statement. ""The fact that China insists on
keeping the report under wraps is reason to believe they have
something to hide. The administration should press for the
report's release at next week's summit.""
 The letter was writtten by Schumer and Republican Senator
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina a South Carolina Republican,
who have proposed punitive legislation aimed at pressuring
China to allow the yuan to rise, and signed by eight others,
mostly from industrial states.
 Most countries authorize the IMF to release the staff
reports, and China had done so in previous years.
 ""China's failure to do so in 2009, despite regularly opting
for transparency in previous years, is troubling, suggesting
that China seeks to suppress any findings critical of China's
manipulation of the value of its currency,"" the senators wrote
in the letter.
 The IMF and the Treasury had no immediate comment on the
letter.
 M-WORD NOT USED
 However, the IMF staff report did not clearly state that
China was manipulating its currency, said Eswar Prasad, a
former head of the IMF's China division who is familiar with
the report.
 ""They did not use the term 'currency manipulation', they
used the term, 'substantially undervalued,"" said Prasad, now a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
 The latter term implies at least a 20 percent
undervaluation of the yuan, Prasad said, adding that coupled
with the report's assessment of a rapid rate of reserve
accumulation, the report ""could be interpreted as suggesting
that China could be manipulating its currency.""
 The IMF has since used the term ""substantially undervalued""
when referring to the yuan, most recently in March in a
briefing note to Group of 20 ministers. The fund has long
argued that China should allow its currency to rise in value to
ease global trade and financial imbalances.
 Geithner, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top
Obama administration officials are heading to Beijing for the
so-called Strategic and Economic Dialogue with their Chinese
counterparts May 24-25. China's yuan exchange rate is expected
to be a key topic.
 Geithner in April delay a much-anticipated decision on
whether China deliberately manipulates its currency for trade
advantage, choosing instead to try to persuade Beijing to
resume more yuan flexibility through a number of bilateral and
multilateral meetings this spring and summer.
 Among these are next week's economic summit and meetings in
June for the G20 wealthy and developing economies.
 China in mid-2005 began allowing a gradual rise of the yuan
from around 8.2 to the dollar to about 6.83 by mid-2008.
However, it has not budged from that level since then, even
though China's growth rate has remained strong.
 China has given some signals that it may be ready to move
on the yuan. The People's Bank of China last week said in a
quarterly moetary report that it would manage the currency
""with reference to a basket of currenccies"" but giving no
timetable.
 The market for one-year yuan/dollar non-deliverable
forwards  implies a 12-month yuan appreciation of
2.26 percent.
 But analysts say that that the euro's continuing slide on
worries of the Greek debt crisis spreading could deter China
from moving.
 ""The Greek crisis presages a period of economic weakness in
the euro area which remains one of China's key export markets,
so they would take a double hit if they revalued. It's very
unlikely that they will engineer a move in the rmb any time
soon,"" Prasad said.
 The IMF is due to send a team to Beijing for the 2010
annual consultations in a few weeks.

 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled on Tuesday to
a fresh four-year low against the dollar on speculation
Germany's ban on naked short-selling of some securities would
encourage more traders to bet against the 16-nation currency.
 Analysts said Germany's move did little to resolve Europe's
debt crisis, and would simply channel more investors to express
bearish views on the euro zone through its currency, now that
there are restrictions on certain types of short sales of
stocks and bonds.
 The German government plans to ban naked short-selling from
midnight in the shares the country's 10 most important
financial institutions. The ban will also apply to euro
government bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) based on those
bonds. For details, see [ID:nN18512882].
 ""Germany decided it was going to ban naked short selling.
So if you want to express your view but can't sell European
equities or bonds, your only choice is to sell the currency and

 In late New York trading, the euro was down 1.5 percent at
$1.2213 , after earlier dropping as low as $1.2161 on
electronic trading platform EBS, the weakest level since April
2006. Traders expect it to fall to $1.18 in the near term.
 Worries about debt troubles in weaker euro zone economies
and the long-term economic impact of austerity measures that
their governments are planning have weighed heavily on the
single currency. Since the beginning of the year, it has lost
almost 15 percent versus the greenback.
 Euro/dollar one-month risk reversals , which
show a bias for puts, increased to -2.6125 on Tuesday from
about -2.4 at midday, according to GFI data. On Monday, euro
risk reversals surged to -3.90, showing the most bearish
sentiment on the euro since GFI made options data available to
Reuters in early 2007.
 Euro/dollar one-month vols , meanwhile, surged as
well to 15.25 from about 13.77 percent earlier in the session.
On Monday, it closed at 15 percent.
 ""Today's decision will simply channel more investors and
speculators to express a negative view in the currency ...
unlimited euro downside ahead,"" said David Gilmore, a partner
at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut.
 Against the yen, the euro fell 1.7 percent to 112.76
. The dollar dropped 0.3 percent to 92.32 yen .
 The ICE Futures U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the
greenback versus a basket of currencies, rose to a 14-month
high of 87.357 before easing back to 87.096, up 1 percent on
the day.
 The dollar and yen both benefited from a rise in risk
aversion as U.S. stocks fell on worries that austerity measures
in Europe would dent a global economic recovery.

market volatility but see the euro extending its declines,""
said Vassili Serebriakov, senior currency strategist at Wells

 By Paul Eckert
 WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - The United States will use
economic talks next week with China to focus on intellectual
property rights protection and China's ""indigenous innovation""
industrial policy which discriminates against foreign firms,
U.S. Trade representative Ron Kirk said on Tuesday.
 ""Our next steps with China include continued pressure to
strengthen their IPR regime -- and to step back on their flawed
and troubling policies across the industrial sector, like
indigenous innovation,"" he said in remarks prepared for a
speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
 Many foreign companies have objected to Chinese policies
aimed at increasing China's share of the world's most valuable
patents and trademarks by requiring companies to develop and
register intellectual property in China to qualify for
government procurement preferences.
 The so-called indigenous innovation policy -- seen by
outsiders as as a sign that China is retreating from steps it
has taken to open its economy to foreign companies -- will be
raised by top U.S. officials in the bilateral Strategic &
Economic Dialogue in Beijing on May 24-25, Kirk said.
 The issue of intellectual property rights stems from
China's failure to curb counterfeiting of manufactured products
ranging from software and Hollywood movies to pharmaceuticals.
 Kirk said he and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke would also
pursue those issues at the bilateral Joint Commission on
Commerce and Trade, which follow those talks.
 Efforts to conclude the stalled Doha Round of World Trade
Organization talks faced a ""key road block"" from the developing
countries, he said.
 ""Make no mistake: The success or failure of Doha depends on
whether advanced developing countries like Brazil, China and
India accept the responsibility that goes along with their
growing roles in the global economy,"" he said.
 ""If we do that, then we can have a successful conclusion to
this round,"" said Kirk.
 U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and Chief Executive
Thomas Donohue last week criticized the Obama administration
for its reluctance to complete free trade pacts with Colombia,
Panama, and South Korea.
 The deals were signed by the George W. Bush administration,
but not approved by the U.S. side in the face of opposition
from labor unions. U.S. economists and business leaders
complain that the United States is being sidelined while
competitors move ahead on trade deals.
 Kirk said he was working with the U.S. Congress and other
stakeholders to move ahead with the pacts with Colombia,
Panama, and South Korea.
 ""The Obama administration understands and values the
economic benefit and strategic relationship with each of these
three important friends and economies,"" he said.
 ""There is no reason for us to leave the United States at a
competitive disadvantage,"" while other countries forge free
trade pacts, added Kirk.
 ""I want these done,"" he said.
 South Korean Trade Minister Kim Jung-hoon told the chamber
that U.S. businesses were ""facing opportunity costs"" with the
delay, because in the three years since the bilateral pact was
signed, Seoul has reached free trade deals with the European
Union and Australia and was also talking to China.
 ""The cost of inaction keeps rising and U.S. workers and
companies are the ones who are the victims of this inaction,""
Kim said.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled against the
U.S. dollar on Tuesday on persistent concerns deep government
spending cuts in Europe will stifle growth and after Germany
said it plans to ban naked short-selling.
 The euro fell as low as $1.2255 after the German
announcement, still slightly above a four-year low of $1.2234
set on electronic trading platform EBS on Monday.
 The German government plans to ban naked short-selling from
midnight in the country's 10 most important financial
institutions, a spokesman for the Finance Ministry said on
Tuesday in Berlin. The ban will also apply to credit default
swaps (CDS) on euro government bonds as well as euro government
bonds. For details, see [ID:nN18512882].
 ""It tends to suggest desperation on the part of the German
officials who want to discourage what they consider speculative
attacks on euro-zone financial markets,"" said Michael Malpede,
analyst at Easy Forex in Chicago.
 ""The mood is very bearish, but I still think we're due for
a correction, as the market is heavily oversold.""
 In afternoon trading in New York, the euro was down 1.1
percent at $1.2264 .
 On Monday, the euro hit a low of $1.2234 on EBS, the lowest
level since April, 2006. Worries about the long-term economic
impact of austerity measures adopted across Europe have weighed
on the single currency in recent weeks. Since the beginning of
the year, the euro has lost more than 14 percent versus the
greenback.
 The euro also fell 1.3 percent to 113.15 yen ,
while the dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 92.25 yen .
 ""We think the momentum was to the downside even before the
short-selling news, but critics could say that the Europeans
continue to fret about the symptoms rather than the actual
illness and so could have accelerated this latest move in the
euro,"" said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman.
 Thin expects the euro to hit $1.18 in the near term.
 The euro is a ""fundamentally strong"" currency and the
European Union's economic fundamentals are safe, European Union
President Herman Van Rompuy said on Tuesday. [ID:nBRU010832]

 * Meet again in June
 * Banks setting up trade finance default database
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 18 (Reuters) - Banking regulators and commercial
banks have started to discuss ways of ensuring that regulation
does not hamper trade finance -- the lifeblood of global
commerce -- as the sector shows an uneven recovery.
 A meeting hosted by the World Trade Organization on Tuesday
to review the recovery of the $10 trillion market in trade
finance since the crisis brought an official from the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision around the table with industry
practitioners who fear regulation could undermine the market.
 ""(This was) a first contact between the regulators... and
the bankers on this particular issue of trade finance,"" one
trade finance source who attended the meeting told Reuters.
 Regulatory issues affect huge sums for banks active in the
market that underpins the $12 trillion in world trade through
traditional, short-term loans.
 For instance the current Basel II regulations treat all
short-term loans as if they run for at least one year, requiring
banks to set aside capital accordingly.
 At their London summit in April last year, G20 leaders urged
regulators to be flexible in this for trade finance, but only
Britain's Financial Services Authority (FSA) has waived the
one-year rule for the industry.
 
 TIED CAPITAL
 The representative of one major bank in the industry told
the meeting that if all other regulators followed the FSA, his
bank would save $10-15 billion in capital on trade finance.
 That could finance 10-12 times as much again in trade.
 The meeting heard that 95 percent or more of trade finance
deals -- collateralised on the cargo and self-liquidating -- for
manufactured goods run for 60-90 days. For commodities it is
less, with an oil cargo typically turned around in 38 days.
 Because trade finance is a low-returns business, it cannot
compete with more glamorous areas such as investment banking or
forex trading at the best of times.
 Regulations already make it unprofitable for many of the big
international players, who are only sticking with it because
they need to provide a full range of transaction banking
services to their global clients, sources at the meeting said.
 Banks fear further pressure on margins will come from
proposed regulations known as Basel III that will impose a
liquidity ratio to tax off-balance sheet items, where many banks
hid toxic assets in the run-up to the crisis.
 Because basic trade finance instruments such as documentary
letters of credit are held off balance sheet until they are
verified and become irrevocable commitments, this will hit trade
finance banks hard, especially as 75 percent of such letters are
never confirmed.
 To back their contention that trade finance is twice as safe
as other forms of lending, banks have agreed to pool data on
default rates in a project managed by the International Chamber
of Commerce (ICC), which sets letters of credit standards and
arbitrates disputes, and funded by the Asian Development Bank.
 The meeting heard that 8-10 leading banks in the sector will
provide five years of proprietary data in a pilot project for
the defaults database -- enough to test the highs and lows of
the business cycle.
 The Basel regulator was receptive but, like WTO
Director-General Pascal Lamy, stressed the need for hard data,
sources at the meeting said.
 ""Very encouraging -- the dialogue will continue,"" said one
banker.
 Bankers and regulators will meet again on trade finance in
June, once in Frankfurt and once in Seoul, the sources said.
 Banks attending the meeting include Royal Bank of Scotland
, Citigroup's  Citibank and HSBC .

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday
despite progress on a rescue package for debt-stricken Greece
and U.S. stocks fell in choppy trade as the weakness of the
euro stirred concerns about the impact on sales of technology
companies with big overseas sales.
 Investors' aversion to risk remained high, despite progress
on a rescue package for Greece, driving up U.S. Treasury
prices. Some analysts questioned the sustainability of the
global economic recovery and the ability of the U.S. Federal
Reserve to begin to move away from keeping short-term interest
rates near zero percent.
 European shares, however, rose, snapping two consecutive
days of declines, after Greece received funds from the European
Union to repay its immediate debt. Banks rebounded and were
among the best performers after a flat performance on Monday.
 But another wave of caution colored investor sentiment
after the close of European markets, and U.S. safe-haven assets
strengthened as investors worried about the long-term
sustainability of the 750 billion euro ($925 billion) plan to
rescue the debt-laden euro zone.
 ""It's a one-two punch: First is continuing concern over the
euro and continuing concern over the viability of the (single
currency) union, and then second is rotation out of large-cap
tech,"" said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity
Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 2.94 points,
or 0.03 percent, at 10,628.77. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> was down 1.99 points, or 0.18 percent, at 1,134.95 and
the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was down 14.88 points, or
0.63 percent, at 2,339.35.
 Shares of technology companies such as Intel and Apple,
which tend to rely heavily on overseas sales, led losses. Intel
Corp  dropped 2 percent to $21.47 while Apple 
slipped 0.4 percent to $253.23.
 Limiting the broader market's losses was Wal-Mart Stores
Inc , the world's largest retailer, whose shares rose
2.8 percent at $54.19 after earnings topped estimates.
 Global stocks as measured by the MSCI All-Country index
<.MIWD00000PUS> shed gains to trade up 0.12 percent while its
emerging markets component <.MSCIEF> rose 0.27 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed up 1.3 percent at 1,026.64 points.
 The index is still down 1.8 percent for the year on
concerns about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis in the
peripheral economies.
 In economic news, ZEW economist Michael Schroeder said the
euro zone rescue package would weigh on medium-term growth in
Germany as budget cuts reduced demand.
 Earlier, the ZEW Institute reported that its May German
economic sentiment index fell more than expected in May.
[ID:nDEP003314]
 U.S. Treasuries rose as the euro weakened against the
dollar and Wall Street stocks fell from earlier gains. The
30-year bond rose a full point as investors viewed it as cheap
relative to other Treasuries.
 ""There is some fine-tuning of risk positioning,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in
New York.
 The 30-year bond  rose 1-5/32, its yield easing
to 4.29 percent from 4.36 percent on Monday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
14/32, with the yield at 3.4385 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 1/32, with the yield at 0.7854
percent.
 The euro  fell 0.31 percent at $1.2355 per dollar,
while against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.11
percent at 92.48.
 Earlier, the euro had risen against the dollar on optimism
that financial aid for Greece was coming through as planned.
 ""We believe the 'breather rally' in EUR merely represents a
selling opportunity, as the currency will be plagued by
austerity in some countries and loan guarantees out of the
other countries -- hardly a recipe for a buoyant regional
economy and/or stronger currency,"" said T.J. Marta, chief
market strategist at Marta on the Markets LLC, long before the
euro fell on the day.
 Officials said Greece received a 14.5 billion euro
emergency loan from the European Union and would use some of
the money to repay in full an 8.5 billion euro bond maturing on
Wednesday [nLDE64H0X9].
 That helped narrow the 10-year Greek/German government bond
yield spread and cut the cost of insuring against a Greek
default, supporting the euro.
 U.S. crude oil futures rose sharply , rising 1.7
percent to $71.31.
 Earlier, Asian stocks fell to three-month lows as traders
continued to fret about the impact that euro zone spending cuts
would have on exporters in the region. In Japan, the Nikkei

 (Recasts with Greek developments, previous Mannheim)
 By Lefteris Papadimas
 ATHENS, May 18 (Reuters) - Greece received a 14.5 billion
euro ($18 billion) loan from the European Union on Tuesday and
can now repay its immediate debt, a development that helped to
steady global investor's jitters.
 The euro edged up from Monday's four-year low against the
dollar after officials said Greece had received the 14.5 billion
euro tranche of its EU emergency loan, some of which would be
used to repay in full an 8.5 billion euro bond maturing on
Wednesday.
 The EU and IMF agreed at the beginning of the month to lend
Greece 110 billion euros ($137 billion) over three years to help
it pay billions in expiring debt after being shut out of
financial markets by the high cost of borrowing.
 With 5.5 billion euros already delivered by the IMF, Greece
has now received the first 20-billion euro tranche of the loans,
the Greek Finance Ministry said in a statement.
 ""Greece no longer has the liquidity anxiety, it will not
need to go to markets to borrow to pay salaries and pensions,""
EFG Eurobank economist Gikas Hardouvelis told Reuters.
 But it still faces a mammoth task to claw its way out of
recession and though it has gained a breathing space, Greece
must now convince markets it can rein in its deficits so that it
can eventually start borrowing again.
 There are also concerns other EU countries such as Portugal
and Spain could follow Greece and need aid from the bloc.
 Greece will be paying interest of around 5 percent, well
below current market yields of well over 7 percent for Greece's
3-year bonds.
 ""The programme has been designed so that Greece is able to
stay away from the financial markets through the end of 2011 and
the first quarter of 2012. We don't expect that to be the case,
we want to come back to markets much sooner,"" Finance Minister
George Papaconstantinou said in Brussels.
 Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou's government has
already implemented sizeable public sector wage cuts and raised
taxes in return for the EU/IMF bailout.
 In response, sometimes violent protests have swept Athens
and a general strike and demonstration have been called for
Thursday. But the government still has more painful measures in
the pipeline such as pension reform and cuts in spending.
 Greece's main labour unions, representing some 2.5 million
workers, or half the Greek workforce, said on Tuesday they will
carry out more strikes in June if the government's pension bill
raising retirement age is not changed.
 ""The government hasn't realised yet the size of the
explosion,"" said Ilias Iliopoulos, general-secretary of public
sector union ADEDY.
 Greece aims to cut its deficit from nearly 14 percent of GDP
to 3 percent by 2014, a task the like of which almost no
government has achieved before. An economy deep in recession,
with GDP projected to contract by 4 percent this year, makes the
job even harder.
 But U.S. stocks opened higher on Tuesday as investors became
more optimistic on the progress that euro-zone finance ministers
were making on Greece's rescue package.
 Global markets steadied as investors were encouraged by
comments from European ministers that they will clarify this
week some technical and legal details of the 750 billion euro
($925 billion) rescue plan [ID:nLDE64G290].
 The 10-year Greek/German government bond yield spread
tightened and the cost of insuring against a Greek default fell,
helping to support the euro.
 ""The euro has been oversold so there is at least a bounce in
the short term,"" said Carol Hurley, senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago. ""But longer term, the euro could go to
parity (with the dollar), maybe even by the end of the year.""
 
 HEDGE FUNDS UNDER SCRUTINY
 Earlier, Asian stocks had fallen to three-month lows as
traders continued to fret about the impact that euro zone
spending cuts would have on exporters in the region.
 Meanwhile German investor sentiment fell sharply in May on
concern growth will be stifled the Greek rescue package.
 The closely watched ZEW analyst and investor survey saw
medium-term growth down in Europe's biggest economy.
 ""The EU rescue package will in the mid-term reduce budget
deficits, but it will also dampen demand and mid-term growth
will be dampened as well,"" ZEW economist Michael Schroeder told
reporters.
 EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels meanwhile overrode
British objections and backed stricter rules on hedge funds as
part of efforts to learn the lessons of the global financial
crisis and create a more stable financial system.
 Greece blames hedge funds for exacerbating its borrowing
problems by betting against its debt and wants them banned.
Italy's Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti for his part called for
curbs on credit default swaps.
 Eighty percent of the bloc's hedge funds are located in
Britain. Any changes are likely to take effect around 2012.
 U.S. President Barack Obama has discussed the debt crisis
with European leaders and some U.S. analysts warn the U.S.
economy, where GDP growth is forecast at 2.8 percent this year,
could stall again if Europe's crisis fails to stabilise.
 IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky said the
global economy ""remains sluggish, uneven and still in need of
policy support"".
 ""As recent events in Greece have shown, risks remain
considerable,"" he told a symposium in Tokyo.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2010 11:44AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-How Germany may consolidate its budget," By Madeline Chambers
 BERLIN, May 18 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel is
working on ways to consolidate Germany's budget and has warned
of tough savings decisions before her government presents a
draft 2011 budget at the end of June.
 For the first time, the government will have to take into
account a new ""tax brake"" rule which requires the government to
reduce the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio and cut
the structural deficit by 10 billion euros, say experts.
 Germany's public deficit is expected to exceed 5 percent of
GDP this year. Although this is significantly lower than levels
in some other euro zone states, it still breaches the EU's
official three percent cap. 
 After forecasts published earlier this month showed the
cumulative total of tax receipts through to 2013 would be 39
billion euros lower than expected, conservative Merkel abandoned
plans for tax cuts outlined in her coalition deal with the
pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).
 That has left politicians in Europe's biggest economy
haggling over where the axe should fall in terms of spending. 
 Here are some of the options under discussion:
 
 VAT RISE
 * Some experts, including the head of the DIW economic think
tank, have proposed raising sales tax to 25 percent from 19
percent, arguing that could generate more than 50 billion euros.
 However, senior members of Merkel's conservative Christian
Democrats (CDU) -- including Deputy Finance Minister Steffen
Kampeter and her pro-business Free Democrat (FDP) partners --
have said this is not under consideration.
 It would be a sure and simple way of raising revenues.
 On the other hand, Germans experienced a hefty increase
three years ago and such a move would do little to address sharp
criticism from France and other euro zone states that Germany
should do more to boost domestic demand.
 One option might be a smaller rise or getting rid of some
exemptions to sales tax. 
 In 2007, Merkel's government introduced the biggest tax rise
in post-war Germany by raising sales tax by 3 percentage points.
 * Likelihood: big rise looks unlikely. Even a small rise
would encounter stiff resistance within Merkel's coalition.
 
 ABOLISH TAX BREAKS/SPENDING CUTS
 * German media have reported Merkel and Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble agreed on Sunday to focus on abolishing some
tax breaks and reducing expenditure at some ministries. They
want, however, to protect areas that spur economic growth.
 Likelihood: looks like the most probable approach
 
 CUTS ON EDUCATION/CHILDCARE 
 * Conservative heavyweight Roland Koch, viewed as a possible
finance minister if Schaeuble has to resign due to ill health,
has pushed hard for cuts in these areas.
 However, Merkel and other leading conservatives have ruled
out targeting this area. Merkel has made it a long-term priority
to raise spending on education to 10 percent of GDP.
 Likelihood: unlikely 
 
 CURBING PENSIONS/UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT
 * A report in Handelsblatt daily said Merkel and Schaeuble
agreed there would be no cuts in these areas. Merkel has made it
a priority during the financial turmoil and euro zone debt
crisis to stop unemployment spiralling out of control.
 Likelihood: very unlikely

 TRANSPORT 
 * This is seen as a big-budget department where cuts could
be made relatively painlessly and therefore seems an obvious
target. Some experts have called for a motorway toll on cars to
raise revenues but this could be a long and complex process. 
 Likelihood: looks very likely

1117,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2010 11:40AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Changes to EU econ governance proposed by EU exec," BRUSSSELS, May 18 (Reuters) - European Union finance
ministers will discuss changes to the 27-nation bloc's budget
rules and ways to strengthen economic governance on May 21.
 Below are some key points from the Commission proposal that
will serve as a starting point for the discussions and that
received positive feedback on Tuesday, when the Commission
presented them to the ministers for the first time. 
 The ministers' talks are to end in October.

 PREVENTING BAD POLICIES
 In the first six months of each year, starting in 2011,
European Union countries, and especially euro zone members,
would send their rough budget plans for the next year to the
Commission. 
 The EU executive would check if they are in line with
economic guidelines agreed on by EU leaders and with national
long-term plans for putting public finances on a sustainable
path as well as national reform programmes that often have to
accompany fiscal consolidation.
 The Commission would write an opinion about the submitted
rough budget plan which euro zone and/or EU finance ministers
would later discuss at a regular monthly meeting. 
 This would give the Commission and the ministers a chance to
discuss budget plans of an EU country that are inconsistent with
its earlier declared fiscal consolidation or reform programmes
or would have a clear impact on other EU countries, but have not
yet been voted into law by a national parliament.
 Because the peer review of the budgets would happen at the
early planning stage, the sovereignty of national parliaments'
decisions on the final budget proposal would not be affected.
 The review of the budget drafts would not be detailed, but
focus only on the main parameters.
 
 ENFORCEABLE BUDGET TARGETS 
 EU budget rules, the Stability and Growth Pact, say that all
European Union countries should strive to achieve a budget close
to balance or in surplus. They should do it by cutting their
deficits by at least 0.5 percent of GDP a year until it is
reached. But there are no sanctions for not doing so and many
countries have been ignoring this rule.
 The Commission therefore proposed that countries not moving
towards a balanced budget or to a surplus when economic growth
is above its potential, should make an interest-bearing deposit
with the Commission as a penalty. 
 The proposal did not spell out the size of the deposit or
when it could be returned to the country with the accrued
interest.

 SWIFTER PENALTIES
 A euro zone country which repeatedly ignores budget
consolidation targets set by EU finance ministers can eventually
be fined up to 0.5 percent of GDP. But the procedure, from start
to potential fines, could take almost two years.
 The Commission therefore proposed that the procedure should
be faster, in particular for countries which repeatedly break
the rules. It has not made more specific recommendations yet.

 BROADER PENALTIES
 Non-euro zone countries cannot be fined for having budget
gaps above the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP. Therefore launching
the EU's disciplinary budget steps -- the excessive deficit
procedure -- against them is more a political embarrassment for
their governments than a threat of real sanctions.
 There is, however, one lever that has never been used -- the
Commission may suspend cohesion funds paid out to the country
under the EU's budget for various projects and not restart them
until the deficit falls back below 3 percent.
 The Commission therefore proposed that when the EU's next
7-year budget starts in 2014, EU cash in general flowing into
various countries, not only cohesion funds, should be used as an
incentive for countries to stick to EU budget rules.
 Until the new long-term budget comes into force, the
existing possibility of suspending cohesion funds to a repeated
budget deficit offender should be more rigorous.

 FOCUS ON DEBT
 EU rules say that countries should not have a debt to GDP
ratio higher than 60 percent. However, few euro zone countries
have debt below that ceiling and debt trends have not been given
much prominence in the EU's disciplinary budget steps.
 The Commission would like this to change. 
 It proposed on May 12 that a country, even if its deficit is
below the threshold of 3 percent of GDP but its debt is above 60
percent and not falling quickly enough, should be subject to the
EU's excessive deficit procedure. The proposal did not specify
what the appropriate annual decline in debt should be.
 To get out of the disciplinary budget steps, the country
would have to set its deficit in such a way so as to ensure that
the debt would be on a substantially declining path. Fiscal
risks stemming from explicit and implicit liabilities would be
taken into account in assessing debt development risks.

 MONITORING IMBALANCES 
 There are large differences in competitiveness between euro
zone countries, reflected for example in current account
balances. The Commission proposed that the surveillance of the
macroeconomic imbalances should be beefed up.
 The Commission would assess the risk of all possible forms of
macroeconomic imbalances that jeopardise the proper functioning
of the euro area, and suggest what needs to be done. Euro zone
finance ministers would then ask the country to take the
necessary action to remedy it.
 If the country were to fail to act in a given time, euro
zone ministers could step up the surveillance of that country
and issue precise economic policy recommendations. 
 The Commission could also issue warnings to that country.
 The surveillance would include a scoreboard that would
indicate the need for action. The scoreboard would include
developments in current accounts, net foreign asset positions,
productivity, unit labour costs, employment, and real effective
exchange rates, as well as public debt and private sector credit
and asset prices.

(Recasts, adds comment, updates prices)
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro on Tuesday, reversing the single currency's earlier gains,
as investors grew more risk averse and sought safety in both
the dollar and the yen.
 There was no fundamental reason for the moves, analysts
said, but a breakdown of support on dollar/yen prompted more
selling, analysts said.
 After the dollar tested technical support at 92.63 yen,
sell orders kicked in, said Matthew Strauss, senior currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 ""There is some fine-tuning of risk positioning,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in
New York.
 The dollar rose as high as 92.96 yen before giving up those
gains; it last traded little changed at 92.58 yen, off the
session low of 92.34 yen.
 The strength in the yen fed through to a decline in the
euro against the Japanese currency, with the euro giving up all
the session's gains and falling 0.2 percent to 114.43 yen.
 The euro's weakness against the yen in turn impacted the
euro/dollar rate, though investors had been looking for a
reason to sell the single currency after it rallied from a
four-year low on Monday.
 The euro was last down 0.2 percent at $1.2375 off the
session high of $1.2444. It touched $1.2234 on Monday.
 ""We believe the 'breather rally' in EUR merely represents a
selling opportunity, as the currency will be plagued by

that financial aid for Greece was coming through as planned.
 Officials said Greece received a 14.5 billion euro

 That helped narrow the 10-year Greek/German government bond
yield spread and cut the cost of insuring against a Greek
default, supporting the euro.
 Details of the European Central Bank's bond-buying program
announced on Monday and its operation to drain extra liquidity
created by buying debt also eased concerns the bond purchases
would lead to a form of quantitative easing.
 The euro also got endorsement from Poland, with Polish
Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski saying his country could adopt
the euro as soon as 2014 under favorable circumstances.
 But as the euro gave up gains on Tuesday, the dollar rose
0.1 percent to 86.268 against a basket of major currencies
including the Swedish crown, not far from 87.063 hit on Monday,
its highest since March 2009.

 ATHENS, May 18 (Reuters) - Greece received a 14.5 billion
euro ($18 billion) loan from the European Union on Tuesday and
can now repay its immediate debt, but still faces a mammoth task
to claw its way out of recession.
 Concerns that other EU countries such as Portugal and Spain
could follow Greece and need aid from the bloc have hit the euro
, while investors are still watching Athens to see whether its
austerity plan will stave off the risk of default.
 The EU and IMF agreed at the beginning of the month to lend
Greece 110 billion euros ($137 billion) over three years to help
it pay billions in expiring debt after being shut out of
financial markets by the high cost of borrowing. 
 With 5.5 billion euros already delivered by the IMF, Greece
has now received the first 20-billion euro tranche of the loans,
the Greek Finance Ministry said in a statement.
 Athens now can and will repay an 8.5 billion 10-year euro
bond which matures on Wednesday, a government official said.
 ""Greece no longer has the liquidity anxiety, it will not
need to go to markets to borrow to pay salaries and pensions,""
EFG Eurobank economist Gikas Hardouvelis told Reuters.
 Greece will be paying interest of around 5 percent, well
below current market yields of well over 7 percent for Greece's
3-year bonds.
 Though it has gained a breathing space, Greece must now
convince markets it can rein in its deficits so that it can
eventually start borrowing again.
 ""The programme has been designed so that Greece is able to
stay away from the financial markets through the end of 2011 and
the first quarter of 2012. We don't expect that to be the case,
we want to come back to markets much sooner,"" Finance Minister
George Papaconstantinou said in Brussels.
 
 ""NO MAGIC WAND""
 Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou's government has
already implemented sizeable public sector wage cuts and raised
taxes in return for the EU/IMF bailout.
 In response, large and sometimes violent protests have swept
the Greek capital, and a general strike and another mass
demonstration have been called for Thursday.
 But the government still has more painful measures in the
pipeline such as pension reform, and cuts in spending and red
tape to boost competitiveness.
 Investors are closely watching whether Greeks will swallow
the bitter austerity pill, or whether the wave of public anger
continues to rise, and if it does, how well Papandreou stands up
to the pressure to transform the consumer-driven economy.
 Greece's main labour unions, representing some 2.5 million
workers, or half the Greek workforce, said on Tuesday they will
carry out more strikes in June if the government's pension bill
raising retirement age is not changed.
 ""The government hasn't realised yet the size of the
explosion,"" said Ilias Iliopoulos, general-secretary of public
sector union ADEDY.
 Greece aims to cut its deficit from nearly 14 percent of GDP
to 3 percent by 2014, a task the like of which almost no
government has achieved before. An economy deep in recession,
with GDP projected to contract by 4 percent this year, makes the
job even harder.
 ""There is no magic wand, no other way out but for Greece to
deliver on the spending and revenue front and not miss targets,
while also making headway in improving the economy's
competitiveness,"" said an economist who declined to be named. 
 ""The numbers are merciless.""

1120,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2010 10:55AM ET</span>",Poland rues lack of early action on euro zone woes," BRUSSELS, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro zone's debt crisis and
massive rescue costs involved could have been avoided if the
bloc's governments had taken action to aid Greece much earlier,
Polish Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said on Tuesday.
 Speaking after a meeting of European Union finance
ministers, Rostowski blamed some EU institutions and member
states for failing to act fast and refusing initially to involve
the International Monetary Fund in helping Greece.
 ""In the last three months, we had a situation in which many
EU institutions and member states did not react fast enough and
efficiently enough to the threat that appeared,"" he told a news
conference.
 ""We spoke at the beginning of the Greek crisis in February
that Greece should be encouraged to turn to the IMF, but some EU
institutions and governments were against that,"" he said.
 ""If Greece had turned then to the IMF, we would not have had
this crisis and we would have calmed the markets with much
smaller costs,"" he added.
 After months of hestation, the EU and IMF agreed in early
May to lend Greece 110 billion euros ($137 billion) to help it
pay billions in expiring debt. The decision came after Greek
financial woes hit the euro and boosted borrowing costs for some
other countries.
 To prevent the crisis from spreading to other countries, EU
governments, with the help of the IMF, later set up a 750
billion euro emergency aid mechanism for states in trouble in
the currency area.
 Rostowski refused to put blame for on any late decision
solely on the government in Germany, where aiding Greece has
been highly unpopular.
 ""It is not right to point at Germany in particular. Several
other countries and institutions are to be blamed,"" he said,
without giving more details.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2010 10:51AM ET</span>",WTO to rule on China complaint over EU shoe imports," * China challenges EU anti-dumping duties on footwear
 * WTO to rule on US measures on Vietnam shrimp, Korea steel
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 18 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organisation
(WTO) will rule on a dispute between China and the European
Union over shoe imports which has pitched European producers
against consumer groups and companies with operations in China.
 A meeting of the WTO's dispute settlement body decided on
Tuesday to set up a panel to rule on the case after
consultations between China and the European Union failed to
resolve the matter.
The dispute brought by China -- its second at the world
trade body against the European Union -- challenges anti-dumping
duties imposed by the EU of up to 16.5 percent on shoe imports
from China and 10 percent on those from Vietnam.
A Chinese official told the meeting the EU duties had hurt
the jobs and livelihoods of 150,000 people working in leather
footwear.
 ""China wishes to further emphasise that the EU anti-dumping
measures have a very serious impairment on the interests of
Chinese industries,"" he said.
 WTO rules allow members to impose duties on goods that are
""dumped"" -- sold for less than they cost to produce -- if that
hurts businesses in the importing country. However such
anti-dumping measures can be abused to protect local industries
and are one of the most frequent sources of trade dispute.
 ""The European Union takes this opportunity to recall that
the anti-dumping measures for which China is now seeking a panel
are not about protectionism, but about fighting unfair trade,""
EU trade lawyer Sybilla Fries told the meeting.
 
 CONTINUING DEFICIT
 China is the European Union's second largest trade partner
after the United States, with bilateral trade of 326 billion
euros ($404.8 billion) in 2008. But the EU runs a huge trade
deficit with China.
 It was China's second request for a panel after the EU
vetoed a first attempt on April 20. Under WTO rules a respondent
in a dispute can block the creation of a panel once, but must
allow it to go ahead at the second bid.
 China launched the formal dispute in February after
ministers from the EU's 27 members extended the duties by 15
months in December.
 European shoemakers, especially in Spain and Italy, argued
they could not compete with cheap imports from China and
Vietnam.
 The duties were controversial within the EU. Both consumer
groups and shoe producers with operations in China opposed them.
 The Federation of the European Sporting Goods Industry
(FESI), whose members include companies such as Adidas, Puma
and Nike, launched a legal case against the European Union in
March complaining they had suffered losses as a result. 
 Dispute panels are usually formed within a month, and then
aim to rule on cases in two months.
 Vietnam, also targeted by the EU duties, has not challenged
the EU move. But one of two further disputes that went to a
panel at Tuesday's meeting including the first complaint Hanoi
has brought to the WTO, over U.S. anti-dumping measures on
imports of shrimp.
 One of the issues in Vietnam's complaint is the
controversial U.S. method of calculating anti-dumping duties
known as zeroing, which repeatedly has been condemned by WTO
courts and is rejected by all its 153 members except the U.S.
 Zeroing is the focus of the third dispute to go to a panel
on Tuesday -- a complaint by South Korea over U.S. duties on
steel imports.
 But South Korea found itself on the other side of the
argument when Indonesia complained to the meeting that Seoul had
failed to implement previous rulings that found its anti-dumping
duties on Indonesian paper to be illegal.
 Indonesia said it reserved its rights in the case, raising
the possibility it would seek to retaliate against South Korea.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened
higher on Tuesday as investors became more optimistic on the
progress that euro-zone finance ministers were making on
Greece's rescue package, while the euro recovered from the
prior session's four-year low.
 Global markets steadied as investors were encouraged by
comments from European ministers that they will clarify this
week some technical and legal details of the 750 billion euro
($925 billion) rescue plan [ID:nLDE64G290].
 Prices of U.S. Treasury debt, seen as a safe haven
investment, ticked higher as demand was still strong because
worries about euro zone debt problems in the longer term showed
few signs of easing.
 Helping to calm investors' jitters, officials said Greece
received a 14.5 billion euro emergency loan from the EU, and
would use some of the money to fully repay a 8.5 billion euro
bond maturing on Wednesday.
 The 10-year Greek/German government bond yield spread
tightened and the cost of insuring against a Greek default
fell, helping to support the euro.
 ""The euro has been oversold so there is at least a bounce
in the short term,"" said Carol Hurley, senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. ""But longer term, the euro could go
to parity (with the dollar), maybe even by the end of the
year.""
 The euro  rose 0.23 percent from the previous
session's close to $1.2422. Against the Japanese yen, the
dollar  was up 0.19 percent at 92.76 from a previous
session close of 92.580.
 In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average
<.DJI> added 76.55 points, or 0.72 percent, to 10,702.38, also
getting support from solid earnings results from Wal-Mart and
Home Depot.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 8.37 points,
or 0.74 percent, to 1,145.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index

 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares

energy and mining companies gaining.
 ""I would see these gains (in equities) as more of a pause
than the start of an uptrend. The market has slowly but
certainly realized that the problems that Europe has are quite
severe,"" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas

 Earlier, Asian stocks had fallen to three-month lows as
traders continued to fret about the impact that euro zone

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Tuesday in volatile trade, recovering from the prior
session's four-year low as investors became more optimistic for
now on news that financial aid for Greece was coming through as
planned.
 Officials said Greece received a 14.5 billion euro
emergency loan from the European Union and would use some of
the money to repay in full an 8.5 billion euro bond maturing on
Wednesday [nLDE64H0X9].
 This helped narrow the 10-year Greek/German government bond
yield spread and cut the cost of insuring against a Greek
default, supporting the euro.
 Details of the European Central Bank's bond buying
programme announced on Monday and its operation to drain extra
liquidity created by buying debt also eased concerns the bond
purchases would lead to a form of quantitative easing.
 All of this prompted some investors to unwind their bets
against the euro, where short positions reached record levels
last week as concerns grew that austerity measures would hit
growth in the region.
 Though the euro gave up some gains around the time of U.S.
data releases on housing and inflation, the move was said to be
based more on technicals than events.
 ""The euro has been oversold so there is at least a bounce
in the short term,"" said Carol Hurley, senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. ""But longer term, the euro could go
to parity (with the dollar), maybe even by the end of the
year.""
 The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.2405 , having hit
$1.2234 on Monday. It rose 0.4 percent to 115.12 yen
.
 But the euro has lost more than 13 percent this year
against the dollar and yen, making it the worst-performing
major currency and analysts were mostly of the opinion that the
euro's move higher was probably short-lived.
 ""We believe the 'breather rally' in EUR merely represents a
selling opportunity, as the currency will be plagued by
austerity in some countries and loan guarantees out of the
other countries - hardly a recipe for a buoyant regional
economy and/or stronger currency,"" said TJ Marta, chief market
strategist at Marta on the Markets LLC.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 92.74 yen . It fell
0.1 percent to 86.086 against a basket of major currencies
<.DXY> including the Swedish crown, but stayed not far from
87.063 hit on Monday, its highest since March 2009.
 MONEY MARKET PRESSURE
 Despite some easing of risk aversion, money markets still
showed signs of stress, limiting the euro's upside. 
""While the worst market fears may have been assuaged to an
extent, the risks hanging over the banking sector because of
increased funding costs and the effects of a potential
sovereign restructuring remain in place,"" Citi said in a note
to clients.

 In U.S. economic news, U.S. housing starts rose more than

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro edged up from the
previous day's four-year low in choppy trade on Tuesday as
investors took heart from news that financial aid for Greece was
coming through as planned.
 Officials said Greece received a 14.5 billion euro emergency
loan from the European Union and would use some of the money to
repay in full an 8.5 billion euro bond maturing on Wednesday
[nLDE64H0X9].
 This helped narrow the 10-year Greek/German government bond
yield spread and cut the cost of insuring against a Greek
default, supporting the euro.
 Details of the European Central Bank's bond buying programme
announced on Monday and its operation to drain extra liquidity
created by buying debt also eased concerns the bond purchases
would lead to a form of quantitative easing.
 All of this prompted some investors to unwind their bets
against the euro, whose short positions reached record levels
last week as concerns grew that austerity measures would hit
growth in the region.
 ""Some of the market instability has started to subside, at
least for the moment,"" said Robert Minikin, currency strategist
at Standard Chartered.
 The euro was up 0.15 percent at $1.2412 , having hit

 MONEY MARKET PRESSURE
 Despite some easing of risk aversion, money markets still
showed signs of stress, limiting the euro's upside.
 Three-month interbank dollar lending rates rose to 0.46469
percent in London fixing from 0.46 on Monday , their
highest since August, reflecting strong demand for dollar funds.
 Euro rates eased to 0.63 percent from 0.63125.
 ""While the worst market fears may have been assuaged to an
extent, the risks hanging over the banking sector because of
increased funding costs and the effects of a potential sovereign
restructuring remain in place,"" Citi said in a note to clients.

market performance of the European banking sector closely since
the start of the year, removal of these concerns may represent
the key to stopping the euro's slow descent.""

1130,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2010 04:35AM ET</span>",UK inflation unexpectedly surges to 17-month high in April," LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate jumped
more than expected in April to hit a 17-month high, driven by
big rises in tax on alcohol and tobacco, as well as women's
clothing and food prices, official data showed on Tuesday.
 The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices
rose by an annual 3.7 percent last month compared to 3.4 percent
in March, above economists' expectations of an increase to 3.5
percent.
 The Bank of England will now have to write to new
Conservative finance minister George Osborne explaining why
inflation is still more than 1 percentage point above the
government's 2 percent target, as inflation has not eased
significantly in the three months since the BoE last wrote.
 Nonetheless, most economists and the central bank expect
higher inflation to be transitory, as one-off effects are
gradually outweighed by weak growth and high unemployment, which
limit the ability of firms and workers to raise prices and
wages.
 Britain's annual Budget fell a month earlier in 2010 than in
2009, bringing forward annual rises in tax on alcohol and
tobacco, which accounted for a third of the increase in the
annual rate of CPI between March and April.
 Higher prices for food and for clothing and footwear both
also contributed a similar amount to the increase in the CPI
rate from March to April.
 On the month, consumer price inflation rose by 0.6 percent.
 The retail price inflation gauge rose to 5.3 percent from
4.4 percent, versus forecasts for a rise to 4.9 percent, the
highest since July 1991. That was largely driven by base effects
after the sharp fall in mortgage interest rates in 2009 was not
repeated in 2010.
 RPI includes more housing costs than CPI, which matches the
European Union Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), and
is used to index many social security payments and some wages.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro slipped versus the
dollar on Tuesday, sticking near a four-year low as the euro
zone debt crisis and worries that austerity steps may hurt
regional growth dogged the European common currency.
 Investors awaited a meeting of euro zone finance ministers
later in the day, when they are expected to smooth out details
of a $1 trillion plan to prevent debt problems plaguing Greece
from spreading to other euro zone nations.
 Spain and Portugal, which are seen at risk of falling into a
debt crisis, are expected to outline measures to cut their
budget deficits, while officials may continue to rally behind
the euro to calm concerns that the system is unravelling.
 The euro slipped as low as $1.2315, before pulling back to
$1.2400 by 0740 GMT, little changed on the day.
 It hovered in range of $1.2234 hit on Monday for the first
time since April 2006, and analysts said it would remain under
selling pressure.
 ""In terms of levels, we expect to see a break lower. The
fundamental story remains for the dollar to strengthen against
the euro,"" said Kasper Kirkegaard, currency strategist at Danske
in Copenhagen.
 He expected the single currency to fall below its trough hit
on Monday, while adding that record net short positioning in the
euro had raised the risk of a short-term correction.
 A 1.2 percent rise in European share prices dampened
safe-haven demand for the dollar. It was little changed versus a
currency basket at 86.156, though not far off the 87.063 hit on
Monday, its highest since March 2009.
 Against the yen, the dollar was also little changed at 92.73
yen.
 
 EURO SHORTS
 Keeping the euro under selling pressure was news that the
Senate had voted for the U.S. government to oppose International
Monetary Fund bailouts to countries unlikely to repay them.
 Market players fretted about the potential impact on any
future IMF measures to help ease the euro zone's debt crisis,
prompting some euro selling, although there was uncertainty
about how much impact the Senate decision would have.
 ""Even small factors can prompt selling of the euro on
rallies at the moment. After its failure to clearly break above
$1.2400 yesterday and today, the market may have taken the news
as a factor,"" said Daisuke Karakama, a market economist at
Mizuho Corporate Bank in Tokyo.
 Some traders said the euro may be poised to rise further
over the course of the week, given the potential for further
short-covering.
 U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released last
week showed currency speculators boosted net short positions in
the euro to a record high in the week ended May 11.
 One upside target in the near term may be $1.2445, a 61.8
percent retracement of its fall from Friday's high near $1.2575
to Monday's four-year low of $1.2234.
 On the downside, the next key support for the euro lies near
$1.2135, a 50 percent retracement of a rally from all-time lows
near 82 U.S. cents to record highs just above $1.60.

 By Bate Felix
 MADRID, May 18 (Reuters) - The European Union and Central
American states reached an agreement on Tuesday to liberalise
trade and cut import tariffs, giving total market access to
industrial products on both sides.
 The European Commission, the EU's executive in charge of
the 27-nation bloc's trade policy, said the deal would formally
be concluded by EU and Central American heads of state at a
summit in Madrid on Wednesday.
 ""The agreement will offer new market access prospects for
exporters from both sides in agricultural products,
automobiles, electronics, banking, telecoms and environmental
services,"" EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told a news
conference in the Spanish capital.
 Trade between the regions stood at nearly 10 billion euros
($12.3 billion) in 2009.
 Nicaragua's leftist president, Daniel Ortega, praised the
results and said he sees commercial opportunities from the
deal.
 ""I can give the good news to the Nicaraguan people that we
have achieved basic agreements that will benefit Nicaragua,
despite the complexities of negotiating in the middle of a
global (economic) crisis,"" Ortega said in a speech on Monday.
 Central American states export mostly agricultural products
such as coffee, bananas and other fruits to the EU and import
machinery, chemicals, vehicles and fuels from Europe.
 CARS, COFFEE, SUGAR
 The European Union, Central America's largest trading
partner after the United States, began trade negotiations with
Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and
Nicaragua in 2007.
 The negotiations nearly collapsed last week due to
differences over the EU's dairy export demands. The EU
subsequently agreed to reduce its quota demand from over 4,000
tonnes of milk and 4,000 tonnes of cheese to 1,900 tonnes for
powdered milk and 3,000 tonnes for cheese.
 European car makers will be given free access to Central
American markets for 10 years, while EU companies in the
services sector will also have better access in the region.
 In return, the EU has offered to cut banana tariffs to 75
euros per tonne from 114 euros per tonne, as agreed in Geneva
last year to end a long-running ""banana war"". [ID:nLDE5BE1GZ]
 The EU also offered market access to new imports of 10,000
tonnes of beef and 20,000 tonnes of rice annually from the
Central American states. This could create a potential new
market worth nearly 50 million euros annually for Central
American exporters.
 Central American coffee producers like Costa Rica and
Guatemala, known for their top-quality beans sold at high
prices, pushed for denomination of origin rules to label coffee
from specific countries as a specialty product.
 ""We are very satisfied because (the deal) included strict
origin rules. The name of Costa Rican coffee will be protected
there,"" Ronald Peters, the head of Costa Rica's coffee
institute told Reuters on Tuesday.
 The deal stipulates a 162,000-tonne import quota for
Central American sugar, but producers were disappointed it was
not larger, Carlos Melara, head of the Honduran sugar producers
association said.
 ""There could have been better negotiations for Central
American interests ... To save the negotiation politically they
sacrificed our sector,"" Melara said.

 NAIROBI, May 18 (Reuters) - Kenya should avoid relying too
heavily on external debt as it seeks to fund its medium-term
development plans up to 2012, the International Monetary Fund
said.
 East Africa's largest economy has had plans to issue a
debut $500 million eurobond since 2007, mainly to create a
benchmark and to raise private inflows. It wants to become a
middle income country by 2030.
 ""An international bond is not without risks, especially
given the current market conditions, high carrying costs and
foreign exchange risks,"" the fund said in a statement seen by
Reuters on Tuesday.
 Kenyan officials shelved the bond plan when a bloody
post-election crisis in early 2008 rattled investors and put
the country's credit rating at risk. They hope to revive it
when the global economy recovers.
 ""High reliance on foreign direct investment flows,
especially if in the form of debt, and corporate borrowing from
abroad to finance the private-sector initiatives could,
together with public-sector financing, worsen overall debt
dynamics,"" the IMF said.
 The country's best option is to seek concessional loans for
financing the public investment part of its medium-term

excessive borrowing,"" it said in the statement which was

 TOKYO, May 18 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Tuesday, its
trend seen weak despite a rebound from a four-year trough, due to
persistent investor jitters over the euro zone's fiscal woes and
concerns that austerity steps could hurt the region's growth.
 The euro's slide had deepened after it fell last week below
$1.2500, where a large option barrier was said to lie, and the
single European currency had been due for a bounce given the
scope of its recent fall, market players said.
 Traders said that while the euro may consolidate and start to
form a near-term bottom, it was premature to think that its
longer-term downtrend was drawing to a close, and its moves were
likely to stay choppy.
 Some traders said the euro could bounce a bit more before
running into resistance. One upside target on Tuesday may be
$1.2445, the 61.8 percent retracement of its fall from Friday's
high near $1.2575 to Monday's four-year low of $1.2234.

Juncker sought to reassure markets on Tuesday that despite a
sharp fall, the euro was a credible currency and the European
Central Bank would ensure inflation remained under control.
 Markets have been selling the euro on concern that euro zone
austerity measures will damage economic growth in the 16-country
currency area. The austerity steps are a reaction to market
fears about the risk of a debt default in some euro states.
 Some economists also have said that while the euro zone's
750 billion euro ($924 billion) safety net for the debt
obligations of its members solved near-term insolvency risk, it
did not resolve the longer-term problem of huge public deficits.
 The euro  has fallen nearly 7 percent against the
dollar this month, hitting a four-year low on Monday. It has
lost about 13.5 percent for the year, making it the
worst-performing major currency so far in 2010. 
 ""The euro is a credible currency,"" Juncker, who chairs
monthly meetings of euro zone finance ministers, told a news
conference after their talks ended in the early hours of Tuesday
morning.
 He told reporters on Monday: ""I'm not worried as far as the
euro exchange rate is concerned. I'm worried as far as the
rapidity of the fall is concerned."" 
 Some market participants are also concerned that the ECB
started buying government bonds on the secondary market as part
of the euro zone safety net, in what many said amounted to
monetising government debt.
 They have criticised the move as a step too far that could
create inflation dangers by expanding the money supply.
 But Juncker added that the ECB, which has said it would
start sterilising the bond purchases next week to avoid
increasing money supply, had a good track record in preserving
price stability and would continue to do so.
 ""Price stability has been fully maintained and will be
maintained in the future,"" Juncker said.
 ""This is a major feature of the euro and a major asset for
investors,"" he said.

 * Farmers' union says deal will damage EU farm sector
 * EU Commission: too early to assess impact of any deal
 
 By Bate Felix and Charlie Dunmore
 MADRID/BRUSSELS, May 17 (Reuters) - The European Union and
the Mercosur group of four South American countries relaunched
talks on Monday aimed at creating the world's largest trading
bloc despite warnings that a deal could hurt EU farmers.
 Interest in creating a free-trade zone representing 750
million people with annual commerce worth nearly 100 billion
euros ($123 billion) has grown since the start of the financial
crisis and delays to the Doha round of world trade talks.
 Mercosur -- Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay -- and
the 27-country EU will hold a first round of talks in July.
 ""We relaunched the negotiations because we are quite
convinced we can make them lead to an ambitious, balanced,
association agreement,"" Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the
executive European Commission, told a news conference. 
 The relaunch has met strong criticism from EU farmers. Many
EU farm ministers earlier on Monday in Brussels warned against
reviving the talks, saying a deal would put thousands of
European farmers out of business.
 But Barroso, speaking after talks with the Mercosur
countries in Madrid, said both sides would have to make
concessions for an agreement to be reached.
 When the talks were suspended in 2004, Mercosur countries
expressed dissatisfaction with the EU's offer of access to
agricultural markets.
 At that time, the EU was seeking proposals from Mercosur on
opening the South American bloc's telecoms market and protection
for EU industries.
 Any deal would be likely to involve Europe cutting its
import tariffs for agricultural imports in return for greater
access to Mercosur's services and telecoms markets.

 EXODUS
 European farmers union Copa-Cogeca said in a statement that
such a deal would put further pressure on farmers' incomes and
cause an exodus from the sector and from rural areas.
 ""The EU Commission's proposal to relaunch the trade talks is
totally unacceptable. A bilateral trade agreement with Mercosur
will cause a sharp rise in beef, poultry, wheat, citrus
fruit/juice imports to the EU from these countries,"" the union's
president Paolo Bruni said.
 At the start of a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels,
French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire reiterated his
country's opposition to a deal, which was outlined last week in
a declaration signed by seven other EU states. [ID:nLDE64A283]
 ""I don't see why agriculture always has to be the bargaining
chip in Europe's trade negotiations ... especially when a
certain number of South American countries, notably Argentina,
are putting new protectionist tariffs on food imports,"" he said.
 Le Maire warned ministers that removing EU import tariffs on
agricultural products from Mercosur countries would lead to a 70
percent jump in imports of beef and a 25 percent rise in poultry
imports.
 On Monday several other EU countries came out against the
negotiations in addition to the eight that signed last week's
joint declaration, bringing the total to ""about 15"", one EU
source said.
 
 IMPACT ASSESSMENT
 Consensus emerged in the meetings that the European
Commission should assess the impact of any deal between the EU
and Mercosur before it is signed, and that it should not
undermine progress in the stalled Doha round. 
 ""It's a sensitive issue for agriculture,"" EU Farm
Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said. He added it was too early to
say what the impact on EU farmers could be.
 ""It's only a relaunch of negotiations, and as you know these
talks take lots of time. We have to see what Mercosur's position
is and what they put on the table,"" Ciolos said.

ruled on Monday that makers of prestressed concrete steel wire
strand (PC strand) in China had dumped their products in the
United States or had received state subsidies.
 Chinese manufacturers and exporters had sold PC strand--
wire rod bars used in construction -- at between 42.97 percent
and 193.55 percent below fair value, the department found.
 Xinhua Metal Products Co Ltd. was found to have a final
dumping rate of 175.94 percent, while Fasten Group Import &

Wuxi Jinyang Metal Products Co received a rate of 42.97
percent, it said.
 All other Chinese producers or exporters will receive a
final dumping rate of 193.55 percent, the department said in a
statement. U.S. imports of PC strand from China were valued at
$13 million last year.
 In a countervailing duty case involving some of the same
Chinese companies, Commerce found that Chinese producers or
exporters of PC strand had received countervailable subsidies
ranging from 8.85 to 45.85 percent.
 Fasten Group Import & Export Co Ltd and Xingu Metal
Products received final subsidy rates of 8.85 percent and 45.85
percent, respectively. Other producers or exporters got a
subsidy rate of 27.35 percent, it said.
 The investigation was launched following a petition by
American Spring Wire Corp. of Ohio, Insteel Wire Products Co of
North Carolina and Sumiden Wire Products Corp of Tennessee, the
statement said.
 Anti-dumping and countervailing duty charges will be
assessed once the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)
makes a final determination over whether the petitioners were
damaged by the imports. The ITC has until June 28 to make that
ruling.
 The decision comes as U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke
visits Hong Kong on a clean energy trade mission ahead of the

 TORONTO, May 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar pared steep
losses against the U.S. currency on Monday, but still ended
slightly lower as global risk aversion continued to play out
over nagging worries about Europe's debt crisis.
 The euro also rallied from a four-year low versus the
greenback, helped by a turnaround in U.S. stocks, which
temporarily offset fears that euro zone austerity measures
could trigger a downturn in the region. [FRX/]
 ""I think the market just needs to a get a little more
comfortable with what's transpired, plus the new valuation for
euro, plus what lies ahead for the euro zone itself,"" said
Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Europe was
following the right path to manage the debt crisis, and said
there were no signs the crisis was spreading beyond Greece,
Spain and Portugal. [ID:nSGE64G0G1]
 Also weighing on the commodity-linked currency, crude
prices fell below $70 a barrel, pushed down by concerns about
Europe's economy, the weak euro, swollen U.S. oil inventories
and worries that China's growth may be slowing [O/R]
 With no major economic announcements or key euro zone
developments to take direction from, Sutton said the market was
trying to stabilize.
 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American
session at C$1.0337 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.74 U.S. cents,
down from Friday's finish at C$1.0317 to the U.S. dollar, or
96.93 U.S. cents.
 Earlier, in the overnight session, the currency fell to its
lowest level in more than a week at C$1.0440 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.79 U.S. cents, caught in the crossfire of euro
selling.
 ""I think as we look ahead, Canada should still strengthen,""
Sutton said.
 ""On a relative basis it's poised to do quite well. So we
would expect it to continue to strengthen once we get through
this spike in risk aversion.""
 Sutton said key levels of support and resistance for the
currency rest between the 100-day moving average of C$1.0316 to
the U.S. dollar and the 200-day moving average of C$1.0494.
 BONDS ALSO PRESSURED
 Canadian government bond prices were lower across the curve
as investors awaited key retail sales and inflation data later
in the week.
 ""We know the Bank of Canada is going (to raise interest
rates) in June or it's going in July. We know that the bank is
completely data-dependent at this point,"" said said Ian
Pollick, a portfolio strategist at TD Securities.
 ""Those are the two real last pieces of information we need
... That will really give us a good sense of what the bank is
going to do.""
 Bond prices tend to fall when interest rates go up as their
low-yielding fixed payments seem less lucrative compared with
rising yields on other investments.
 The two-year government bond  dipped 11 Canadian
cents to C$99.25 to yield 1.877 percent, while the 10-year bond

 Canadian bonds lagged their U.S. counterparts with the
Canadian 10-year bond yield almost 2 basis basis points above
the U.S. 10-year yield, compared with 2.2 basis points below on
Friday.
 ""Today's just one of those days where we're seeing light
flows across the market. It's pretty much dead to be honest
with you,"" said Pollick.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro rallied from a
four-year low against the dollar on Monday, helped by a
turnaround in stocks late in the session which temporarily
offset fears that euro zone austerity measures could trigger a
downturn in the region.
 As the euro began to rise, investors who had bet against
the single currency were also forced to buy back euros in order
to cut their losses in what is known as a ""short-squeeze.""
 Given the euro zone's debt problems, the euro has become a
proxy for risk appetite, rising and falling in tandem with U.S.
stocks.
 The euro's correlation with the S&P 500 was at a robust 87
percent on Monday, the highest since February, according to
Reuters data.
 ""We're seeing a little bit of a short-squeeze on the euro.
Mondays tend to be a reversal day lately plus the fact that
stocks have recovered and that's provided an impetus to exit
euro shorts,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist, at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Dolan also believes the euro is likely to hit a short-term
bottom between $1.2150-$1.2200 within the next few days and
could rise back to the $1.26-$1.27 area.
 ""I think people are getting bored with euro weakness.
You've got everybody and his brother talking about the euro
That's a sure indication that the euro is due for a correction
higher,"" he added.
 In late New York trading, the euro changed hands 0.2
percent higher against the dollar at $1.2387. Earlier in the
global session, the euro fell as low as $1.2234, according to
electronic trading platform EBS, the lowest in more than four
years.
 Against the yen, the euro traded up 0.1 percent at 114.54
yen after falling to 112.47 in Asia trade. The dollar was last
at 92.51 yen, flat from Friday's close.
 The euro has fallen nearly 7 percent against the dollar
this month, and is about percent 13.5 for the year, making it
the worst-performing major currency so far in 2010.
 Technical analysts said the next key support was at
$1.2135, the 50 percent retracement of the rally from the
all-time lows near 82 U.S. cents to record highs just above
$1.60.
 Overall, sentiment on the euro remained negative, analysts
said, and many think this rise in the euro is short-lived.
 MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS
 A 750-billion euro ($1 trillion) bailout package from the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund aimed at
shoring up euro zone bond markets has done little to appease
concerns Greece's debt crisis could spread to other similarly
indebted countries such as Spain and Portugal.
 ""It's a package that raises more questions than answers and
wouldn't necessarily alleviate the euro zone debt crisis,"" said
John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange trading at ING
Capital Markets in New York.
 ""We expect the euro to slip further as long as we remain in
this lack of resolution phase in the euro zone. But it's not a
straight line function and I'm sure we're going to see a bounce
here and there.""
 European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny earlier
said the fall in the currency was not a cause for concern,
adding the exchange rate was in a ""normal range"" and there was
no reason for hysteria about it.
 However, Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on
Monday he was worried about the pace of the euro's fall than
the exchange rate itself.
 The ECB on Monday bought 16.5 billion euros worth of bonds
in the first week of its government debt buying program to help
resolve the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Analysts said widening euro zone problems had prompted a
money market dollar liquidity shortage.
 ""If the sharp deterioration in money markets persists into
this week, look for central bank action to lower the cost of
access to their dollar funding facilities,"" Citibank analysts
said in a note.
 Sterling, meanwhile, slid to its lowest since March 2009 at
$1.4249 before rising back to $1.4474, still down 0.4 percent
on the day.
 The pound was hit by data showing the past year's rise in
British house prices may be cooling.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2010 04:04PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Euro survival requires less budget sovereignty," By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, May 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone member states will have
to forego some of their national budget sovereignty if Europe's
single currency is to survive in the long term.
 That conviction is driving European Commission proposals for
prior surveillance and peer review of national budget plans
after the Greek debt crisis forced governments into a $1
trillion emergency package to stabilise the euro last week.
 The trouble is that there is little or no political appetite
in member states to cede more power to Brussels.
 Germans furious at having to lend money to profligate Greeks
despite the EU treaty's ""no bailout"" clause are fuming against a
""transfer union"", while the high-spending French seethe at the
notion of unelected bureaucrats forcing austerity on them.
 It's not a promising starting point for agreeing on earlier
mutual fiscal supervision to ensure that much flouted EU rules
on public deficits and debts are actually respected. But the
crisis has so shaken the 11-year-old currency area that what was
unthinkable last week may be unavoidable next week.
 Ironically, policymakers and elder statesmen from elsewhere
in the world are united in believing that the Europeans will
have to move towards far greater economic, fiscal and political
integration to make their currency union work.
 At the annual conference this month of the Trilateral
Commission -- a network of policy elites from North America,
Europe and East Asia which now embraces China and India --
former ministers, business leaders and central bankers agreed
the EU would have to grow into a much closer economic union.
 Would Europe have the leadership to achieve this, a Chinese
speaker asked politely, saying how big an inspiration the EU was
to Asian nations developing regional cooperation. Conference
groundrules prohibited identifying or directly quoting speakers.
 However, the Europeans themselves are still in denial about
the political consequences, not least because in many member
countries the crisis has triggered nationalist reflexes.
 The EU proposals would give the Commission and other member
states an earlier say in shaping national budgets before they
are confirmed by parliaments, and would widen the scope of
macroeconomic surveillance to risks such as payments imbalances
and asset price bubbles.
 While Brussels would not have the power to change national
budget plans, it could issue ""guidance"" aimed at bringing them
into line with European objectives. Bond markets might punish a
country that ignored such advice.
 After 15 years of focusing almost exclusively, at German
insistence, on the target of budget deficits not exceeding 3
percent of gross domestic product, EU governments have realised
that other metrics such as public debt, private sector
indebtedness, shifts in unit labour costs and real estate prices
may also cause instability.
 The Commission wants tougher sanctions, including the
possibility of suspending EU funds to budget sinners and forcing
governments that do not cut their deficits sufficiently in boom
years to hand over a compulsory interest-bearing deposit.
 It also wants a longer-term ""crisis resolution mechanism"",
which might allow highly indebted states to restructure their
debt, although any talk of even a negotiated, orderly, partial
default is taboo in Brussels and EU capitals.
 The plan, which must be approved by EU finance ministers,
drew howls of protest on the French left and the German right.
 Many lawmakers said it would undermine parliamentary control
over public finances, a core attribute of national sovereignty.
 French Left party leader Jean-Luc Melanchon denounced ""prior
control of sovereign states by appointed Eurocrats. What a
police state!""
 In Germany centre-right Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle
recalled that parliament had budget sovereignty in a democracy.
 Berlin wants more intrusive European budget surveillance and
statistical auditing of states with high debts and deficits such
as Greece and Portugal, but not of its own fiscal and economic
policies.
 The Germans reject any scrutiny of their export-driven
policy, which many economists say contributed to imbalances in
the euro area by building a massive current account surplus
while depressing domestic demand.
 The Commission plan aims to achieve a political trade off
between Berlin's demand for tougher budget discipline and Paris'
wish to coordinate economic policies to promote stronger growth.
 The euro zone's founding duo share much of the blame for
weakening the EU budget rules, since they forced the suspension
of disciplinary procedures in 2004 to avoid facing sanctions
over their own repeated breaches.
The challenge for the Commission is to avoid its plan being
seen simply as Brussels-imposed ""austerity for all"", which would
make the European Union even more unpopular with voters.

 * Markets will dictate terms unless G20 produces good plan
 * Reiterates need for strong regulation, opposes bank tax
 By Louise Egan and David Ljunggren
 OTTAWA, May 17 (Reuters) - World leaders must act more
quickly than previously thought to assure markets they will
reduce government debt, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper
said on Monday.
 Speaking to participants in a Canadian youth summit, Harper
said the Greek debt crisis and concerns about fiscal health
elsewhere highlight the need for the world's leading economies
to address the issue decisively at June's G20 summit in
Toronto.
 ""We now need to reassure markets not just that we are
prepared to intervene when we have to, but that governments can
run responsible and sustainable balances over the long term,""
Harper said.
 ""Obviously, markets have a lot of doubt about that ... I
think it's pretty critical that this will have to be addressed
and I think it'll have to be addressed a lot quicker than
probably leaders thought six months ago.""
 Earlier, Harper said in a statement that he was writing to
his fellow G20 leaders to urge they ""confront our fiscal
challenge with clear and realistic plans for fiscal
consolidation, or we can wait for markets to dictate the terms
for us.""
 Canada is host of next month's Toronto summit of the G20, a
grouping that gathers major developed and emerging economies
representing about 80 percent of global gross domestic
product.
 NO TO BANK TAX
 Canada's other big push at the summit will be on stronger
banking regulation, while firmly resisting efforts to impose a
global bank tax.
 The Conservative government in Ottawa has long argued that
due to stricter rules, Canadian banks did not exploit some of
the lucrative dealings that eventually got their U.S. and
European counterparts into so much trouble. They therefore did
not need bailouts and it would be unfair to tax them now,
Canada says.
 ""We know what has to be done. You have to have a strong
system of prudent and active regulation,"" Harper said.
 Other G20 members in the developing world agree with Ottawa
on the issue, Harper suggested.
 ""I think we will be very strongly supported in that ...
many emerging economies also did not contribute to the
financial crisis,"" he said.
 Canada will escalate its call for the G20 to follow through
on promised financial regulatory reforms through co-ordinated
speeches in four different cities around the world on Tuesday,
a government official said.
 Finance Minister Jim Flaherty will speak in Mumbai, and
three other cabinet ministers will deliver similar messages in
Shanghai, Washington and Ottawa throughout the day.
 Even while tackling issues for the post-crisis era, Harper
repeated Canada's position that major nations need to properly
implement stimulus plans to prevent the world from slipping
back into crisis, saying the economy recovery was ""extremely
fragile"" in some countries.
 Harper also said the G20 should be ""looking to countries
with high savings to provide greater support for demand"" -- a
clear reference to China, which is under pressure to let its
currency strengthen to help the global economy.

conservatives will push for a European financial transaction tax
to help cover the costs of the debt crisis, parliamentary
sources told Reuters on Monday.
 Volker Kauder, parliamentary floor leader of the
conservatives, spoke strongly in favour of the tax at party
talks, according to the sources.
 ""The levy has become a symbol of the participation of the

 Merkel has been cool on the idea of a transaction tax,
saying it would be tough to get it agreed internationally. It
would be easier to push through a European tax.
 The sources said Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had
already agreed to support the proposal for a European
transaction tax and to present it at the meeting of EU finance
ministers in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday. Only Britain and
Sweden are expected to oppose such a tax, the sources said.
 Earlier in the day, asked about the option of an EU-wide tax
on financial transactions, a government spokesman said this was
part of the discussion process but stressed that Germany was
focusing on other ideas, such as a bank charge.
 Merkel's Free Democrat allies (FDP), with whom she rules in
a centre-right coalition, opposed a financial transaction tax.

 * Weaker euro could boost exports, help growth
 * EU cracks down on hedge funds

(Adds Greek and Italian fin. ministers, hedge fund move, ECB)
 By Sakari Suoninen
 MANNHEIM, Germany, May 18 (Reuters) - German investor
sentiment fell sharply in May on concern growth will be stifled
by a 750-billion-euro ($930 billion) rescue package designed to
calm market fears of a wave of Greek-style debt crises.
 Tough conditions, similar to those imposed in International
Monetary Fund (IMF) bailouts, have been set for euro zone states
seeking shelter from markets anxious about their debt levels.
 The closely watched ZEW analyst and investor survey saw
medium-term growth down in Europe's biggest economy.
 ""The EU rescue package will in the mid-term reduce budget
deficits, but it will also dampen demand and mid-term growth
will be dampened as well,"" ZEW economist Michael Schroeder told
reporters.
 EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels meanwhile overrode
British objections and backed stricter rules on hedge funds as
part of efforts to learn the lessons of the global financial
crisis and create a more stable financial system.
 Greece blames hedge funds for exacerbating its borrowing
problems by betting against its debt and wants them banned.
Italy's Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti for his part called for
curbs on credit default swaps.
 Eighty percent of the bloc's hedge funds are located in
Britain. Any changes are likely to take effect around 2012.
 Greece was forced to seek a record 110-billion-euro bailout
this month as borrowing costs soared due to market fears it
could default on its enormous debts.
 But markets then focused on other vulnerable euro zone
states, forcing the group's leaders to devise a $1 trillion
safety net with the IMF to protect other vulnerable members.
 The package prompted Germany, the biggest national
contributor, to abandon 16 billion euros of tax cuts designed
initially to lift its export-driven economy.
 And with Spain and Portugal agreeing additional austerity
measures to rein in their budget deficits, the fear is the drive
to fiscal consolidation will slow growth -- which the European
Commission already saw at just 0.9 percent in 2010.
 Reacting to the ZEW survey, Unicredit analyst Alexander Koch
said increased savings efforts in neighbouring states would
reduce the demand for German exports.
 ""There the thumb screws are being applied to the budget:
i.e. tax increases and spending cuts. This dampens private
consumption and public investment,"" he said.
 U.S. President Barack Obama has discussed the debt crisis
with European leaders and some U.S. analysts warn the U.S.
economy, where GDP growth is forecast at 2.8 percent this year,
could stall again if Europe's crisis fails to stabilise.
 IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky said the
global economy ""remains sluggish, uneven and still in need of
policy support"".
 ""As recent events in Greece have shown, risks remain
considerable,"" he told a symposium in Tokyo.
 
 ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE, FISCAL REFORM
 Euro zone states are trying to smooth out wrinkles in their
rescue plan, which comprises standby funds and loan guarantees
that governments can tap if shut out of credit markets.
 Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said the
talks would help markets realise that ""there is clear
willingness and commitment on the part of the euro zone and
non-euro zone to help those countries that are in need, as long
as they do what is needed"".
 The European Central Bank meanwhile drained 16.5 billion
euros from the commercial banking system on Tuesday to dull the
potential inflationary impact of government bonds bought to
support euro zone debt markets.
 On Monday, euro zone ministers agreed to consider a proposal
that broad macroeconomic outlines of national budgets be
discussed in advance at the European level, with speedier
penalty procedures for countries that breach EU budget rules.
 ""It is essential now that we show we are serious about
fiscal consolidation. I could sense broad support for the
Commission proposals (on economic surveillance),"" said Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
 The debt crisis and concerns over growth have hit the euro,
which has fallen some 14 percent against the dollar this year.
 It edged up from Monday's four-year low after officials said
Greece had received a 14.5 billion euro tranche of its EU
emergency loan, some of which would be used to repay in full an
8.5 billion euro bond maturing on Wednesday.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell for a fifth
straight session against the dollar on Monday, dropping to a
four-year low on nagging fears euro zone austerity measures
will cause a downturn in the region and curb global growth.
 A 750-billion euro bail-out package from the European Union
and the International Monetary Fund aimed at shoring up euro
zone bond markets has done little to improve sentiment on the
euro.
 Some analysts expect the euro to fall below $1.20 over the
next few weeks despite a huge volume of bearish bets against it
that would normally suggest a reversal higher is imminent.
 In this case, analysts expect a combination of negative
sentiment and momentum to carry the currency lower.
 ""Raising more debt to pay old debt is not necessarily the
way for Greece to accomplish what needs to be accomplished,""
said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange trading at ING
Capital Markets in New York. ""It's a package that raises more
questions than answers and wouldn't necessarily alleviate the
euro zone debt crisis. We expect the euro to slip further.""
 In early afternoon New York trading, the euro was down 0.2
percent against the dollar at $1.2340. Earlier in the global
session, the euro fell as low as $1.2234, according to
electronic trading platform EBS, the lowest in more than four
years.
 The euro earlier in New York climbed into positive
territory against the dollar in technical trading. Investors
holding short positions on the currency got squeezed when
dealers hit stop-loss orders as the currency headed to the
$1.2400 level. That move, however, was short-lived.
 The euro has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar
this month, and is nearly 14 percent lower for the year, making
it the worst-performing major currency.
 Technical analysts said the next key support was at
$1.2135, the 50 percent retracement of the rally from the
all-time lows near $0.82 to the record highs just above $1.60.
 European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said the
fall in the currency was not a cause for concern, adding the
exchange rate was in a ""normal range"" and there was no reason
for hysteria about it..
 However, Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on
Monday he was worried about the pace of the euro's fall than
the exchange rate itself.
 The ECB on Monday bought 16.5 billion euros worth of bonds
in the first week of its government debt buying program to help
resolve the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Analysts said widening euro zone problems had prompted a
money market dollar liquidity shortage.
 ""If the sharp deterioration in money markets persists into
this week, look for central bank action to lower the cost of
access to their dollar funding facilities,"" Citibank analysts
said in a note.
 Meanwhile, data released on Friday showed speculative bets
against the euro hit a record high in the week to May 11.
 Against the yen, the euro traded down 0.5 percent at 113.82
yen after falling to 112.47 in Asia trade. The dollar was last
at 92.23 yen, down 0.2 percent from Friday's close.
 Sterling slid to its lowest since March 2009 at $1.4249
before rising back to $1.4433, still down 0.8 percent on the
day. The pound was hit by data showing the past year's rise in
British house prices may be cooling.

 * Ireland warns of serious impact on beef production
 * Commission says too early to assess impacts of any deal
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, May 17 (Reuters) - The European Union's decision
to relaunch trade talks with the South American Mercosur
countries has met with strong opposition from EU farm ministers,
who fear a deal will put thousands of European farmers out of
business.
 The EU is meeting Mercosur countries Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay at an EU-Latin America summit in Madrid
this week, where they are expected to formally revive trade
talks suspended since 2004.
 Any deal would likely involve Europe cutting its import
tariffs for agricultural imports in return for greater access to
Mercosur's services and telecoms markets.
At the start of a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels
on Monday, French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire reiterated
his country's opposition to a deal, which was outlined last week
in a declaration signed by seven other EU states.
 ""France is opposed to the relaunch of the negotiations
between the EU and Mercosur,"" Le Maire told journalists, adding
that this view was shared by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 ""I don't see why agriculture always has to be the bargaining
chip in Europe's trade negotiations ... especially when a
certain number of South American countries, notably Argentina,
are putting new protectionist tariffs on food imports,"" he said.
 Le Maire warned ministers that removing EU import tariffs on
agricultural products from Mercosur countries would lead to a 70
percent jump in imports of beef, and 25 percent rise in poultry
imports.
 During Monday's meeting several other EU countries came out
against the negotiations in addition to the eight that signed
last week's joint declaration, bringing the total to ""about 15"",
one EU source said.
 In his first EU council meeting, Italy's new agriculture
minister Giancarlo Galan said the negotiations presented a great
risk to European farmers, another source in the meeting said.
 ""In the context of the reform of the common agricultural
policy, Galan said the EU can't reduce import tariffs at the
same time as reducing farm support,"" the source said.
 Ireland expressed serious concerns over the potential impact
on its beef sector, and high quality beef production in
particular, which would face serious competition from Argentina
and Brazil.
 Beef accounts for over 30 percent of Ireland's total
agricultural output, according to figures from the Irish Farming
Association.
 Germany was described by sources in the meeting as ""more
against than for"" the reopening of talks, but Britain, Sweden,
the Czech Republic, Denmark and the Netherlands are willing and
ready to negotiate, they added.
 
 IMPACT ASSESSMENT
 There was a consensus in the meeting that the European
Commission should assess the impact of any deal between the EU
and Mercosur before it is signed, and that it should not
undermine progress in the stalled Doha round of global trade
talks.
 ""It's a sensitive issue for agriculture,"" said EU farm
Commissioner Dacian Ciolos, but it's too early to say what the
impact on EU farmers will be, he added.
 ""It's only a relaunch of negotiations, and as you know these
talks take lots of time. We have to see what Mercosur's position
is and what they put on the table.""
 Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has promised
compensation measures for EU sectors negatively affected by any
deal, particularly agriculture.
 But it is too early to say precisely what these measures
would be, or whether they would be included in the planned
reform of the bloc's common agricultural policy, Ciolos said.

 * Bank bought 16.5 bln euros of bonds initially
 * ECB moves quickly to sterilise bond purchases
 * Stark says crisis severe, politicians must rethink
 
 By Paul Carrel and Boris Groendahl
 BERLIN/VIENNA, May 17 (Reuters) - European Central Bank
policymaker Ewald Nowotny criticised German ""hysteria"" over
inflation pressures on Monday in a sign of tensions over the
central bank's foray into buying government bonds.
The Austrian central bank governor was speaking after German
Bundesbank President Axel Weber last week broke ranks to
publicly criticise the ECB's bond purchases, and after
commentary in German media suggested the decision meant an end
to the ECB's independence and the start of higher inflation.
 The ECB revealed on Monday that it had bought 16.5 billion
euros in bonds in the initial days of its programme and would
mop up the money released by the purchases by accepting one-week
deposits -- a key plank in its argument that the purchases will
not fuel inflation.
 Previously, the ECB had said it had no plan to give a
regular tally on the bonds it was buying, apparently because it
wanted to avoid giving useful information to speculators. Its
decision to reveal the information seemed designed to reassure
markets that it was acting quickly and decisively to offset the
purchases.
 ""I am...almost astonished that there is so much hysteria --
and unfortunately to a certain extent especially here in the
country where we are guests -- about inflationary pressures,""
Nowotny said in a speech in Berlin.
 ""This is really not the problem we have. We have a problem
of too-slow growth.""
 Asked whether his comments were directed against Weber,
Nowotny said he would not comment on that. Last Monday, Weber
warned of the risks of government bond purchases.
 ""Buying government bonds entails considerable risks to
stability policy, and thus I regard this part of the ECB
council's decision critically in this exceptional situation,"" he
told the business daily Boersen-Zeitung.
 ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark said last week he
shared Weber's concerns that the purchases posed inflation
risks, and reiterated on Monday that the ECB was determined to
avoid these by absorbing extra liquidity created.
 ""Our primary job is and remains to guarantee price stability
in the euro area,"" he told Austrian radio ORF. ""The new measures
are not going to drive up inflation.""
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has been mounting a public
relations campaign in German media in a bid to rebuff the view
that the ECB is sacrificing its conservative monetary principles
by effectively financing government debt.
 But Trichet has conceded the decision to buy government
bonds, taken last week to complement the European Union's
announcement of a $1 trillion financial safety net for indebted
euro zone states, was carried by an ""overwhelming majority""
among the ECB's 22 policymakers, rather than unanimously.
 It is not the first time there has been a split at the ECB;
in June 2008 there was a three-way split on interest rates
between keeping rates unchanged, hiking them immediately and
hiking them later. In the event, rates were held and raised the
following month. However, it is relatively rare for policymakers
to reveal individual preferences publicly.
 
 WEAKEST LINK
 Analysts said ECB policymakers seemed to see Germany as the
weakest link in their strategy to calm investors and support the
debt of peripheral euro zone nations.
 ""The focus on the German audience could not be clearer,""
Unicredit economist Marco Annunziata said. 
 ""Perhaps the underlying subliminal message here is that
Germany has become 'dislocated' in terms of the reactions to the
'shock and awe' rescue programme launched a week ago.""
 Nowotny also insisted on Monday there was no reason to worry
about the future of the euro currency, which fell to a four-year
low against the U.S. dollar.
 ""There is no euro problem,"" Nowotny said.
 Noting that the euro was in a range of $1.20 to $1.30, he
added: ""We are absolutely...in the normal range, so there is no
specific reason for any special hysteria.""
 The euro slid to $1.2237 on Monday as investors worried that
austerity steps to repair government finances in the euro zone
would slash economic growth. In the long term, weakness of the
euro could fuel inflation.
 ""Unfortunately, in Germany the first impression is that of a
central bank that has resigned itself to financing profligate
governments,"" Annunziata said. 
 ""This instinctively raises fears of a return to high
inflation and a debasement of the value of the currency -- fears
that will have been strengthened by last week's plunge in the
euro.""
 
 FISCAL POLICY
 A battle may also be brewing in the euro zone over fiscal
policy. Stark, one of the architects of the EU's Stability and
Growth Pact, said new measures were needed to avoid future debt
crises, and that euro zone countries should be inspected by an
independent body able to punish them if their budgets tipped too
far into the red.
 ""We should think about an independent commission...which
continuously deals with the budget situation in the countries,""
Stark said. ""You could think of something similar to the U.S.
Congressional Budget Office."" 
 German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported Germany's
finance ministry was thinking about a possible law requiring
euro zone nations to balance their budgets.
 It remains unclear whether many of the euro zone's 16
countries, some of them struggling to emerge from recession,
would be willing to surrender sovereignty over their national
finances in this way.
 The dispute within the ECB could affect the choice of
successor to Trichet, who is due to step down in October 2011,
but analysts still view Weber as the most likely pick.
 ""He was more quiet for some time ... I thought in order not
to hurt his chances of becoming the ECB president,"" said ING
economist Carsten Brzeski. 
 ""Yes, he is hurting his chances, but he is leading by such a
huge margin right now that it will not ruin his chances.""

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro touched a four-year
low on Monday on persistent fears the euro zone debt crisis
will worsen and stifle global growth, and fears reverberated
through financial markets, sending the price of oil and other
commodities lower and dragging down equities around the world.
 U.S. shares slid more than 1 percent as plunging commodity
prices hit energy and materials shares. The price of crude oil
hit a five-month low before slightly paring losses, weighed
down by fears of the potential impact of Europe's unresolved
sovereign debt crisis on economic demand.
 The price of copper fell more than 5 percent and other
industrial metals also tumbled as the dollar strengthened
versus the euro.
 The euro  was down 0.47 percent at $1.2302 from a
previous session close of $1.2360, after earlier falling to a
four-year low of $1.2234.
 European equities managed to close only slightly lower,
with declines in mining shares cushioned by gains in defensive
shares such as food producers and drug makers. The pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU> closed down 0.12 percent at
1,013.06 points.
 U.S. government bond prices rose as investors sought
safe-havens.
 On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the $1

to tackle its fundamental problem: a yawning gap between its
strongest and weakest economies [ID:nLDE64F0FQ].

 ""It's a matter of executing and building in the austerity
plans and putting them in place, so that you're not just
throwing a lot of money at a situation with a lot of debt and
increasing the problem without changing the underlying root of
the problem.""
 Adding to the sour sentiment, Lowe's Cos  the No. 2
U.S. home improvement chain, gave a disappointing profit
forecast for the rest of the year. The chief executive of
Lowe's, Robert Niblock, said on a call with analysts that some
estimates of economic growth have started to come down.
 Shares of Lowe's fell over 3.5 percent.
 ""It is probably a good excuse for a sell-off,"" said Mike

1153,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2010 12:35PM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-Russia's Medvedev cosies up to Ukraine with visit," (Adds Gazprom CEO on merger paragraphs 16-17)
 By Denis Dyomkin and Yuri Kulikov
 KIEV, May 17 (Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
on Monday threw his country's weight behind an economic recovery
in Ukraine, pledging during an official visit to back support
for international lending to the ex-Soviet republic.
 Medvedev's first official visit to Ukraine took place as
ties markedly improve under President Viktor Yanukovich, after
turning sour with his pro-Western predecessor, and the Kremlin
leader said he was glad a new page had been turned.
 ""Russia as a participant in the G20 and the G8 is ready, as
a partner, to advance all issues relating to Ukraine, including
International Monetary Fund and World Bank support,"" he told
journalists
 ""Russia is ready to help in the modernisation of Ukraine's
economy,"" he added.
 The new Yanukovich leadership is hoping to secure a new $19
billion credit programme from the IMF for its struggling economy
after ramming through parliament a 2010 budget with a relatively
tight deficit target of 5.3 percent of GDP.
 Yanukovich has tilted Kiev's policy firmly towards Moscow
since following Viktor Yushchenko -- who had chilly relations
with the Kremlin -- into office in late February.
 Medvedev expressed satisfaction that there was now a
Ukrainian leadership he could do business with. ""Trade, business
contacts, are becoming more active and this is due in no small
part to the fact that the Ukrainian state now has another
administration,"" he said before talks with Yanukovich.
 Yanukovich last month extended the lease of the Russian navy
in Ukraine's port of Sevastopol until 2042 in return for cheaper
gas -- a move that caused an outcry among his opponents.
 His opposition to membership of the U.S.-led NATO military
alliance, ardently pursued by Yushchenko, has also endeared him
to Moscow.
 But Yanukovich's pro-Russian moves have re-invigorated the
political opposition around his old rival, former Prime Minister
Yulia Tymoshenko.
 The Ukrainian nationalist group, Svoboda, gathered a few
score of protesters in a small demonstration near the city
centre in protest at what it said was the sell-out of the
country's sovereignty.
 
 SIGNING AGREEMENTS
 Medvedev and Yanukovich signed agreements on border
demarcation, European security, cooperation between their
respective intelligence services and on moves towards the frozen
conflict in the Moldovan rebel region of Transdniestria which
has a border with Ukraine.
 All the same, the Medvedev visit was likely to stake out the
limits of the new relationship between the two powers.
 Yanukovich, who says he also sees European integration as a
priority for Ukraine, has been cool to a proposal from Moscow
for a merger between Ukraine's energy holding Naftogas and
Russia's state gas giant Gazprom.
 Ukraine wants to retain control of a network that is a
conduit for 80 percent of Russian gas supplies to the European
Union and has noted that Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
made his merger proposal with no advance warning to Kiev.
 Gazprom chief Alexei Miller on Monday stepped up pressure on
Kiev, saying Russia would be ready to fund a complete overhaul
of Ukraine's gas network if it agreed to the merger.
 ""The proposal to merge the two companies is fully in line
with global trends to merge energy firms,"" Miller told
reporters. ""If Gazprom and Naftogaz merge, Gazprom can rely on
its financial resources to fully modernise Ukraine's gas
transportation system,"" he said.
 Yanukovich, to Moscow's irritation, has suggested the EU
should be involved in any talk of a merger. Asked about the
issue last Thursday, Yanukovich said only Ukraine's fully equal
participation in such a joint venture could be envisaged.
""Fifty-fifty -- that would be the only way,"" he said.
 The Yanukovich leadership is rather pushing for creation of
a consortium involving the European Union as well as Russia to
modernise the ageing pipelines.

 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Monday, at one point slipping to a four-year low, on
persistent fears euro zone austerity measures will cause a
downturn in the region and stifle global growth.
 The euro earlier climbed into positive territory against
the dollar after a U.S. report showed strong demand for U.S.
long-term securities. The report sparked a rise in risk
appetite and a flurry of short covering by investors who had
bet the currency would fall further. But that did not last
through the New York morning.
 ""Fiscal and economic concerns are likely to weigh on the
euro for the foreseeable future, though we might get short
squeezes along the way,"" said Stuart Bennett, currency analyst
at Credit Agricole CIB in London.
 Midway through the New York trading session, the euro
 was around $1.2329 against the dollar, down 0.3 percent
on the day. Traders said stops were hit as the euro moved back
above $1.2330.
 The euro has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar
this month, and is about 14 percent lower for the year, making
it the worst-performing major currency.
 European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said the
fall in the currency was not a cause for concern, adding the
exchange rate was in a ""normal range"" and there was no reason
for hysteria about it. [ID:nDEK002037]

money market dollar liquidity shortage.
 ""If the sharp deterioration in money markets persists into

said in a note.
 The euro had extended its losses in Asia after falling
below the post-Lehman October 2008 low around $1.2330, where
traders said stop-losses from model accounts were lurking, and
fell as far as $1.2234 on trading platform EBS, its lowest
since April 2006.
 The euro high on EBS was $1.2415 after the Treasury
Department report showed foreign investors set a record for
purchases of long-term U.S. securities in March, snapping up
$140.5 billion and shattering a previous peak seen in 2007
[ID:nnN17261988].
 The report prompted a rise in risk appetite and investors
who had borrowed euros and sold them on expectations of future
declines were forced to buy the single currency to prevent
losses.
 But investor fear returned as the New York progressed.
A 750 billion euro rescue package from the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund aimed at shoring up euro zone
bond markets has done little to underpin the euro.
 On Friday, the single currency euro plunged after European
Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber said it was important not
to underestimate lingering dangers to financial stability.
[ID:nLAG006286].
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday said the rescue
plan had only bought time to sort out the yawning gap between
the euro zone's strongest and weakest economies.
[ID:nLDE64F0FQ].
 Traders say the austerity measures announced by Greece,
Spain and Portugal could hurt growth in the near term and force
the European Central Bank to keep interest rates low.
""There is a rapidly growing consensus that (the euro) could
fall to parity with the dollar,"" said Ed Yardeni, president &
chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.

euro hit a record high in the week to May 11. [ID:nN14193796].

 * Net long-term inflows hit record
 * Foreigners boost Treasury, agency, corporate bond buying
 * China adds to Treasury stash for first time since Sept
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Foreigners bought a record
$140.5 billion of long-term U.S. securities in March, the
Treasury Department said on Monday, and more than doubled
purchases of U.S. government bonds.
 China remained the largest holder of Treasury debt and
added to its holdings for the first time in seven months. Net
Treasury purchases by all foreign investors jumped by $108.47
billion in March from $48.1 billion in February.
 ""Long-term purchases exceeded our best expectations and
clearly show foreign investors have not satiated their appetite
for U.S. securities,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 March's net long-term inflow was roughly three times the
$47.1 billion inflow in February and shattered a previous
record set in May 2007. The Treasury began compiling the data
in the 1930s.
 Investors said some of the Treasuries buying may have been
driven by worries about Greece's debt crisis and fear of
exposure to the euro.
 Demand for U.S. assets was particularly broad in March,
with foreigners snapping up $16 billion in corporate debt,
snapping a nine-month streak of net selling. U.S. agency debt
purchases spiked to $21.9 billion from $2.4 billion.
 CHINA ADDS TO TREASURY HOLDINGS
 China bought $17.7 billion worth of U.S. government debt in
March, swelling its total holdings to $895.2 billion. It was
the first time China added to its Treasury stash since
September.
 Japan remained in second place with $784.9 billion, up from
$768.5 billion in February.
 ""This is a vote of confidence, of course, and we're
impressed with the breadth of buying and the 'quality' of those
buyers -- UK, Japan, China, OPEC, Canada, Germany,"" said David
Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group,
Stamford, Connecticut.
 China's net Treasury purchases may be ""the first tentative
signs that maybe they really are hostage to the U.S. dollar and
are really struggling to find an alternative to the dollar,""
said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS
Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Some analysts said the worsening of a European debt crisis
that resulted in a $1 trillion bailout for troubled euro zone
governments may show foreigners increased U.S. asset purchases
in April and May.
 The euro has lost more than 13 percent against the dollar
so far this year, hitting a four-year low beneath $1.23 on
Monday.
 ""The data essentially means the dollar is very well
supported on a trade and investment flow basis, which drives
the long-term value of the currency,"" Woolfolk said.
 Overall inflows, which include short-term securities such
as Treasury bills, also rose in March, with foreigners buying a
net $10.5 billion, compared with an upwardly revised $9.7
billion inflow the prior month.
 U.S. banks' own dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign
residents also decreased sharply, by $123.8 billion. Analysts
said that could be partly tied to dollar-demand from investors
in Europe.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro rallied against the
dollar on Monday on a rise in risk appetite after a U.S. report
showed strong demand for U.S. long-term securities and a flurry
of short covering by investors who had bet the currency would
fall further.
 Earlier the euro fell to a four-year low against the dollar
on persistent concerns with euro zone sovereign debt and fears
that planned austerity measures will hurt growth in the region,
but its fortunes revived amid German bank euro buying.
 A short cover is buying a security on which the bet had
been for further declines to prevent losses when it
unexpectedly rallies.
 A Treasury Department report showing foreign investors set
a record for purchases of long-term U.S. securities in March,
snapping up $140.5 billion and shattering a previous peak seen
in 2007, added to the decline in risk aversion.
 ""The euro rose after TICs data injected a little bit of
risk appetite,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research
at GFT in New York. ""Short euro trading is over crowded and if
there is a reason for traders to adjust positions they do it.""
 In early morning New York trade, the euro was around
$1.2405 against the dollar, up 0.4 percent on the day. Traders
said stops were hit as the euro moved back above $1.2330.
 The euro has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar
this month, and is about 14 percent lower for the year, making
it the worst-performing major currency.
 But ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny said the fall in the
currency was not a cause for concern, adding the exchange rate
was in a ""normal range"" and there was no reason for hysteria
about it.
 Technical analysts said the next key support was at
$1.2135, the 50 percent retracement of the rally from the
all-time lows near $0.82 to the record highs just above $1.60.
Analysts said the widening euro zone problems had prompted a
money market dollar liquidity shortage.
 ""If the sharp deterioration in money markets persists into
this week, look for central bank action to lower the cost of
access to their dollar funding facilities,"" Citibank analysts
said in a note.
 The euro had extended its losses in Asia after falling
below the post-Lehman October 2008 low around $1.2330, where
traders said stop-losses from model accounts were lurking, and
fell as far as $1.2234 on trading platform EBS, its lowest
since April 2006.
 A 750 billion euro rescue package from the European Union
and the International Monetary Fund aimed at shoring up euro
zone bond markets has done little to underpin the euro.
 On Friday, the single currency euro plunged after European
Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber said it was important not
to underestimate lingering dangers to financial stability.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday said the rescue
plan had only bought time to sort out the yawning gap between
the euro zone's strongest and weakest economies.
 Traders say the austerity measures announced by Greece,
Spain and Portugal could hurt growth in the near term and force
the European Central Bank to keep interest rates low.
 ""There is a rapidly growing consensus that (the euro) could
fall to parity with the dollar,"" said Ed Yardeni, president &
chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.
 Data released on Friday showed speculative bets against the
euro hit a record high in the week to May 11.
 Against the yen, the euro traded up 0.3 percent at 114.75
yen after falling to 112.47 in Asia trade.
 Sterling slid to its lowest since March 2009 at $1.4249
before rising back to $1.4501, still down 0.3 percent on the
day. The pound was hit by data showing the past year's rise in
British house prices may be cooling.
 The dollar briefly fell further against the yen, though
well off the session low, after a gauge of manufacturing in New
York State continued to grow in May but at a slower pace.
The dollar was last at 92.51 yen, up 0.1 percent from Friday's
close.
 Weakness in the euro and the pound helped the dollar index,
a calculated measure of the dollar's performance against a
basket of currencies including the Swedish Crown, to rise above
87.00, the highest since March 2009. It later eased to 86.051,
the session low.

 * Focus on economy, corporate health to stop downward spiral
 * Euro positioning overstretched
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone assets will come out of
their downward spiral only when investors shift their focus back
to the region's improving economy and unwind overstretched
positions after weeks of selling.
 A week after global policymakers announced a $1 trillion aid
package, the rally in euro-denominated assets has all but
fizzled with the euro hitting four-year lows versus the dollar
as concerns grow fiscal tightening will hit growth.
Arguably, the region's assets are in a lose-lose situation.
Even if belt tightening were to fail, the prospect of debt
default in the peripheral euro zone would resurface again,
leading to a sell-off in the currency, stocks and bonds.
 Against this backdrop, investors have largely neglected
economic improvement due to a weak euro and low interest rates.
In Germany alone, the economy unexpectedly grew early in 2010,
export growth hit near 18-year highs and industrial output rose.
 Furthermore, the euro countries at the centre of the crisis
-- Greece, Spain and Portugal -- make up only 15 percent of euro
zone GDP, meaning any hit to overall growth from austerity
measures would be slight.
 ""We're seeing better European macro but everyone is focusing
on the debt situation. Low interest rates will be with us for a
long time and that should be good for markets,"" said Richard
Robinson, investment manager at Ashburton in Jersey.
 Credit Suisse cites OECD estimates every 10 percent fall in
the value of the euro adds nearly 0.8 percent to European GDP.
The euro has lost nearly 14 percent against the dollar and yen
since January.
 It also estimates 10 percent off the euro's trade-weighted
index will directly add 4 percent to European earnings, given
that 36 percent of earnings come from outside the region.
 Emphasising this point, shares in Airbus parent EADS hit an
8-month high on Friday on hopes the firm would be able to
translate a recent euro slide into improved profits.
 Gary Reynolds, chief investment officer at asset manager
Courtiers, said investors were underestimating how good the
global environment was for stocks.
 ""It's a screaming buy. It's true about Europe too.""
 
 AMBER LIGHT FOR BEARS
 Illustrating the scale of risk aversion, the euro has lost
nearly 10 U.S. cents this month alone, touching a low of $1.2237
, and safe-haven gold hit record highs in various denominations,
including the dollar, euro, Swiss franc and sterling.
 Investors see little respite for the euro even when other
assets bounce as bond buying by the European Central Bank under
the aid package raises the prospect that interest rates will
stay low for longer.
 To make matters worse, such intervention makes it harder for
investors to express their negative euro zone view in the bond
market, leaving the euro to bear the brunt.
 However, amber lights are flashing over euro bears, given
that speculative bets against the single currency have already
swollen to record levels.
Risk reversals, which reflect option market bias towards a
currency, for euro/dollar has hit 2.8 percent favouring euro
puts, their highest since November 2008, after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers threw markets into turmoil.
 Stretched option prices and spot positioning are often an
indication that a reversal of the move is on the cards.
 In addition, too rapid a decline could prompt monetary
authorities to act.
 ""(The ECB) will not want a collapse in the value of the
euro, which would endanger financial stability in the euro area.
The weaker the euro gets, the more investors will start to worry
about the ECB stepping in,"" Barclays Capital said in a note.
 ""The recent sovereign crisis was important and euro
depreciation is understandable given that it happened, but we do
not think that it is likely to carry on for very much longer.""
 The rise in euro zone sovereign concerns come after
governments around the world absorbed risks from deleveraging in
the private sector, mainly banks. But policymakers determined to
stabilise the market are introducing a two-way risk.
 ""Just as it was, in hindsight, the right thing to do to buy
credit at the end of 2008, it might now be the time to buy
sovereigns as the financing backstop has been put in place,""
said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer of fixed income at AXA
Investment Managers.

 * Focus on safe assets, not planning alternative investments
 * Will do best to avoid market impact when selling assets
 
 (Adds comment, background)
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Yuka Obayashi
 TOKYO, May 17 (Reuters) - Japan's public pension fund, the
world's largest, has not adjusted its portfolio of foreign
assets such as euro-denominated assets to reflect the worsening
of the Greek debt crisis, the new chairman of the fund said on
Monday.
 The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) holds assets
of about $1.3 trillion, larger than the GDP of India, making it
a major force in financial markets.
 GPIF Chairman Takahiro Mitani said he thought it was
inappropriate for a long-term investor like the GPIF to sell the
euro or euro-denominated assets when the market is volatile and
the value of such assets has already plunged.
 ""We haven't taken action from our end to reflect the Greek
debt crisis,"" Mitani told Reuters in an interview.
 Mitani, a former Bank of Japan executive director, added
that adjusting its portfolio was also inappropriate when
authorities around the world were taking coordinated action to
support Greece.
 The euro plunged to a four-year low on Monday due to
sovereign debt worries stemming from the Greek debt crisis.
 Global authorities have put together an emergency $1
trillion package to deal with the situation.
 But market players say the euro is vulnerable due to
concerns over whether debt-strapped countries such as Greece can
smoothly bring down their fiscal deficits, and on worries fiscal
austerity measures in the euro zone could weigh on economic
growth.
 Mitani became the head of the GPIF last month after former
Chairman Takahiro Kawase's term expired.
 As of the end of December, the GPIF had allocated 11 percent
of its overall portfolio of 122 trillion yen ($1.3 trillion) to
foreign stocks and 8 percent to foreign bonds.
 The pension fund does not provide a breakdown of foreign
currencies in its portfolio.

 SAFE INVESTMENTS IN FOCUS
 The new chairman said the GPIF would continue to focus on
safe assets and would manage its funds efficiently.
 ""We are not presently thinking of investing in a new asset
class,"" Mitani said.
 The Japanese government has been debating the GPIF's
investment strategy, with a key government minister criticising
it for being too conservative.
 Yet the Health Ministry, which supervises the GPIF, has
outlined a mid-term investment plan calling for it to stick to
safe investments.
 The GPIF is a huge player in the Japanese government bond
market as two-thirds of its assets are held in yen bonds.
 The pension fund's model portfolio breakdown calls for a 67
percent allocation to domestic bonds, 11 percent to domestic
stocks, 9 percent to foreign stocks, 8 percent to foreign bonds
and 5 percent in short-term assets.
 The pension fund managed to generate a return of 6.54
percent during the April-December period last year, but still
sharply underperforms other international pension giants such as
the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers,
which generated a return of 20.7 percent during same period.
 Meanwhile, market players, especially Japanese government
bond traders, were closely watching potential asset sales by the
GPIF in the current financial year which started in April.
 The public pension fund will do its best to limit market
impact as much as possible as it has to sell part of its assets
to generate about 6.8 trillion yen in cash for pension payouts,
Mitani said.
 The GPIF had faced a shortfall in the previous financial
year and it had sold small amount of its assets, he said.
 JGB traders expect a large portion of asset disposals to
come from sales of its massive holdings of yen bonds for the
current fiscal year.
 But the impact is expected be limited as GPIF would sell
bonds over a period of time. In addition, the fund should be
able to cover part of a shortfall from the proceeds of maturing
Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP) or Zaito bonds.
 Mitani would not discuss which asset class the public fund
would generate cash from and also declined to say whether it had
already sold any assets since April.

 LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a four-year low
on Monday on persistent euro zone sovereign debt worries and

 German bank euro buying helped the currency recover in a

 * Reservations for four initial markets to start in July
(Adds details, quote, background)
 By Simon Jessop
 LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Nissan, Japan's third-biggest
carmaker, said on Monday its Leaf electric car would cost under
30,000 euros ($38,110) in most European countries after
incentives offered by governments to push the new technology.
 Nissan Motor Co and French alliance partner Renault are
investing over 4 billion euros in electric vehicles and see them
accounting for 10 percent of new car sales by 2020, an ambitious
forecast compared with those of other carmakers and analysts.
Electric vehicles are expected to account for 4.5 percent of
the total 100 million strong light vehicle market by 2020,
according to a recent report by HSBC analysts.
 Nissan said the Leaf hatchback, which has a cruising range
of 160 kilometres, would cost 29,955 euros ($38,050) after
incentives in Portugal, and 29,995 euros after incentives in
Ireland, including the battery. 
 In the Netherlands, buyers would pay 32,839 euros for the
car and benefit from 6,000-19,000 euros in tax savings over five
years. 
 In the UK, the Leaf, which will be built in Nissan's UK
Sunderland plant from 2013, would cost 23,350 pounds after
government incentives, including the battery, Nissan said.
 Nissan said the price would be ""about the same as a
comparably-equipped diesel or hybrid vehicle"".
 Nissan said it had chosen the four markets for the initial
launch in Europe because of ""significant government incentives
for electric cars and the ongoing development of charging
infrastructure for their successful adoption"". 
 By the end of 2011, the Leaf would be available in all major
Western European countries, it said.
 Potential customers can start registering for a Leaf from
July. The cars are due to arrive in Europe early next year.
 In the U.S. the Leaf is priced at $32,780 excluding federal

 By George Georgiopoulos
 ATHENS, May 17 (Reuters) - Greece's drive to cut its deficit
will only work if combined with measures to stimulate growth and
investment, the prime minister said on Monday, as Athens was
poised to receive funds to cover a major debt refinancing due
this week.
 Fears that deficit-cutting in Greece and elsewhere in the
euro zone will hurt growth were at the forefront of investor
concerns on Monday, sending the single currency to a four-year
low and fuelling fears it may face freefall. [ID:nLDE64G0VE]
 Greece is seen by many economists as a bellwether for other
vulnerable euro zone economies, being the first to tap an EU-IMF
aid mechanism to service a 300 billion euro debt.
 Athens has already received 5.5 billion euros in aid from
the IMF and is due to get more from the EU on Tuesday to pay an
8.5-billion euro bond maturing on Wednesday.
 ""The money has been secured, everything is in place,"" said a
government official who declined to be named.
 Greece was obliged to impose drastic pay cuts and tax hikes
in return for the 110 billion euro ($140 billion) EU/IMF
bailout. Having staved off imminent default, it must now make
sure revenues spur growth, Papandreou said.
 ""This savings programme was the only way to avert the threat
of a state bankruptcy,"" Prime Minister George Papandreou told
Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper. ""The programme can be
sustainable only if we stimulate investment and growth.""
 Austerity measures are expected to further hurt the economy,
which plunged into its first recession in 16 years last year and
is forecast to contract by 4 percent in 2010.
 Investors are now watching the reaction of a restive Greek
public and whether the Socialist government can withstand the
pressure.
 Large, sometimes violent protests against the government
have rocked the Greek capital and labour unions have called a
general strike and major demonstration for May 20. 
 For now though, opinion polls show most Greeks think the
EU/IMF package was necessary, but are angry because they believe
ordinary people will bear the brunt of the suffering while
politicians and the rich continue to be pampered.
 While the government has pledged action against corrupt
politicians, many Greeks are now hungry to see heads roll.
 
 SAFETY NET
 As the austerity measures begin to bite, anger could rise
more with the poor suffering most from cuts in public spending.
 ""I believe we can implement our programme. But we must
ensure the weakest in our society don't fall into the abyss,""
Papandreou said. ""We can't push people below the poverty line.
 ""Part of our savings programme is therefore a safety net.
That will cost money but we have to do it.""
 According to newspaper reports, the German government is to
press other euro zone countries to adopt tighter fiscal rules to
match Berlin's balanced budget law, which prohibits the federal
government from running a deficit of more than 0.35 per cent of
GDP by 2016.
 A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment, but said
the government was drawing up plans to boost the euro and avert
future debt crises, to be presented to a euro zone working group
on Friday. [ID:nLDE64G1E5]
 Asked to comment on market concerns over implementation
risks and whether the belt-tightening would be too much to bear
for the economy and the government, Papandreou said: 
 ""We now have the chance to prove that we can achieve it. If
everyone says the Greeks can't achieve it, then they will
condemn us to fail.
 ""We're not begging for gifts of money, but asking for loans
which will be paid back with high interest rates. I'm sure
Greece is a good investment.""
Papandreou also criticised financial markets for
overreacting to Greece's debt crisis and accused speculators of
helping to provoke panic reactions.
 ""Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy, Jean-Claude Juncker and I
have suggested in a joint letter to Barack Obama whether the
markets for credit default swaps ... should not be closed. The
G20 countries want to discuss this,"" he said.
 On Sunday, Papandreou told CNN that Greece may investigate
U.S. investment banks and their role in the run-up to the Greek
debt crisis which has shaken faith in euro zone economies.

more of its foreign exchange reserves to lend to other countries
in exchange for oil and other natural resources, Caixin magazine
website reported on Monday.
 Chinese banks have already issued about $60 billion in
loan-for-oil deals since the start of 2009. The cash for these
loans was obtained through the foreign exchange market, but now
the government may directly hive off part of its forex reserves
for these deals, Caixin reported.
 Although the change in funding methods may be largely
technical given the government's control over foreign exchange
transactions, it could signal that China wants to step up the
pace of its loan-for-resources agreements.
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which
manages China's $2.45 trillion of forex reserves, will call on
commercial banks to arrange such loans and channel the money to
them, the report said.
 It added that SAFE had already signed a contract with China
Development Bank [CHDB.UL] authorising the lender to provide
credit to domestic companies for overseas investment projects.
 Chinese banks such as China Development Bank, Export-Import
Bank of China and Bank of China <3988.HK> <601988.SS>, have since
2009 extended loans to Russia, Brazil, Kazakhstan and several
other countries in return for guaranteed oil supplies.
 Nigeria's state-run oil company NNPC and China State
Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC) <601668.SS> also agreed
last week to seek $23 billion in funding to build three
refineries and a fuel complex in Africa's most populous nation.
 The project, which would add 750,000 barrels per day of extra
refining capacity, is expected to be funded largely through
credit provided by a consortium of Chinese banks and China's
Export and Credit Insurance Corp. [ID:nLDE64C1MN]

would not benefit from a potential conversion of foreign
currency loans to forint-based ones, the chief executive of the
country's largest lender OTP said.
 Hungary's next government, to be formed later this month by
the centre-right Fidesz party which won April elections, has
said it might consider converting some troubled foreign currency
loans to forint-based ones to eliminate currency risk.
 Economy Minister designate Gyorgy Matolcsy has said foreign
currency mortgages of troubled borrowers should be converted to
forint-based loans with the help of the state.
The conversion, however, would boost repayment obligations
because of Hungary's higher interest rates, costing loan holders
an annual 230 billion forints more than the current loan
structure, OTP Bank Chairman and Chief Executive Sandor Csanyi
told the news channel Hir TV.
""Foreign currency loans cannot be converted into forint
loans,"" Csanyi said late on Sunday. ""However, troubled loan
holders must be assisted, and the government and banks can
cooperate on this.""
He added that loan holders would be able to tolerate a
weaker forint, at around 285 to 290 to the euro versus the
current levels around 275, and those weaker levels would benefit
the economy as well, boosting exports and tempering the price
advantage of imported goods.
 Csanyi also said the key interest rate of the central bank,
which is at a record low at 5.25 percent, is of secondary
importance in boosting lending and economic growth.
 ""Access to external financing, and its price, will depend on
what kind of fiscal and economic policies the next government
will pursue,"" he said, adding that the current risk premium that
retail clients pay because of Hungary's risk assessment is
around 2 percentage points.
 He also said that the entire role of the National Bank of
Hungary must be reconsidered, because its current inflation
targeting regime is too narrowly focused, which led to an
exceedingly strong currency before the crisis, hurting the
economy and exposing it to steeper currency swings.
 ""Fundamentally, the central bank's mandate must be
modified,"" Csanyi said. ""Preserving the forint's value cannot be
the sole goal of the central bank. The central bank must
cooperate with the government in the interest of economic
development as well.""

 * Stock market plunges 5 pct on tightening fears
 * Leading indicator suggests growth has topped out
 * Premier Wen warns of danger of overlapping policies
 By Aileen Wang and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, May 17 (Reuters) - A Chinese leading economic
indicator showed that growth may have already peaked in the
world's third-largest economy, with the stock market falling on
investor worries about the government's campaign to rein in
property prices.
 Adding to the impression that China is now facing stronger
headwinds, a commerce ministry official said exporters were
feeling the pain of a weaker euro and that the trade surplus
would narrow sharply this year.
 The main stock index in Shanghai fell 5.1 percent to its
lowest close in a year and its steepest one day fall in eight
months.
 Many analysts have said that overheating, not a hard
landing, remains the bigger risk for China.
 Nevertheless, in a sign that Beijing will be cautious
before taking more steps to cool the economy, Premier Wen
Jiabao warned over the weekend that the government must avoid
""negative consequences"" from piling up adjustment policies.
 The economy's outlook remains very strong, but it may not
have scope to accelerate over the next few months, according to
The Conference Board. Its leading economic index, or LEI, for
China rose 1.1 percent in March.
 ""Developers may have been front-loading projects in
anticipation of controls on the real estate market that were
subsequently implemented in late April,"" said Bill Adams, an
economist with The Conference Board in Beijing.
 ""The recent behaviour of the LEI for China suggests the
economic expansion is unlikely to accelerate further through
the summer months,"" he added.
 This assessment was in line with a view increasingly
prevalent among economists that Chinese growth probably peaked
at an 11.9 percent year-on-year pace in the first quarter.
 Chen Dongqi, deputy head of the macroeconomic research
institute under the National Development and Reform Commission,
said in comments published on Monday that annual growth would
slow to 10 percent over the remaining quarters of 2010.
 That would hardly be a catastrophe, but the Chinese stock
market fell on fears that there could be worse to come as the
government sets its sights on runaway property prices.
 China still officially describes its monetary policy as
""appropriately loose"". In practice, it has used banks' reserve
requirements, lending controls and a series of property rules
to gradually tamp down on the economy.
 NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES
 Premier Wen Jiabao said on Saturday that the government
faced a dilemma.
 ""Pay attention to coordination in macro economic policy, so
that it forms into a cohesive overall force and also prevent
negative consequences from multiple overlapping policies,"" Wen
told an audience of officials.
 Lu Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank in
Shanghai, said the stock market slump was temporary, caused
primarily by worries over the property clampdown.
 The economy was slowing but still strong, and Premier Wen's
comments indicated that the government would move only gingerly
with further tightening, he said.
 ""The basic tone of the government's macro-economic policies
will not change this year and the possibility of an early exit
from pro-growth measures has also been ruled out,"" Lu said.
 The most feverishly awaited of any policy change by China
is a resumption of yuan appreciation, with the currency
effectively pegged to the dollar since mid-2008 to cushion the
economy from the global financial crisis.
 In fact, the Chinese currency has already been rising
strongly, only against the euro, not the dollar, a commerce
ministry spokesman said.
 ""The yuan has risen about 14.5 percent against the euro
during the past four months, which will increase cost pressure
for Chinese exporters and also have a negative impact on
China's exports to European countries,"" Yao Jian told a news
conference.
 As it tracks the rising dollar, the yuan has appreciated
against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, which many
analysts believe could constrain the scope for any revaluation.
 The yuan hit its strongest level against the euro since
late 2002 on Monday as the euro tumbled against the dollar on
global markets. Offshore dollar/yuan forwards jumped across the
curve to imply less future yuan appreciation against the
dollar.

 GENEVA, May 17 (Reuters) - Demand for business and
first-class seats continued to rise strongly in March, as
economic recovery boosted air travel, the airline industry
association IATA said on Monday.
 Demand for premium seats in March was 10.8 percent higher
than a year ago, rising in the first quarter at an annualised
rate of 25 percent compared with the last three months of 2009.
 But demand for business and first-class travel -- the most
profitable part of airlines' passenger business -- is still 15
percent below pre-crisis levels, the International Air Transport
Association said in its latest premium traffic monitor.
 That contrasts with a stronger recovery in economy travel,
which is back to pre-crisis levels, with demand rising 8.8
percent in March over a year ago, for an annualised increase in
the first quarter of 10 percent, it said.
 ""Growth in both seat classes are being driven by business
travel, rather than leisure. As business confidence and world
trade have turned up sharply business travellers have returned,""
IATA said.
 But consumer confidence has not recovered to the same
extent, with unemployment and consumer debt remaining high,
which will slow the recovery in leisure travel, said IATA, whose
230 airline members include British Airways and Singapore
Airlines.
 The volcanic ash plume in Iceland, which is continuing to
disrupt traffic in Europe, is likely to cut overall
international traffic numbers by 4 percent in April, it said.
 IATA said the recovery in business travel was marked by
strong regional differenceds, with the premium market in the Far
East almost 24 percent higher in the first quarter than a year
ago, while premium travel within Europe was down 3.1 percent.
 Airlines are also seeing a strong recovery in air cargo
demand, which account for some 30 percent of world trade
movements by value.
 IATA's latest forecast is for cargo demand to rise by 12
percent globally this year after falling 10 percent in volume in
2009, driven by a strong rebound in the Asia-Pacific region, it
said in its magazine Airlines International.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2010 05:51AM ET</span>",Japan retail investors lap up uridashi water bonds," * Development bonds seen as source of new customers
 * Uridashis from international agencies weathering euro woes
 * Top-rated issuers give savers a sense of security
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 17 (Reuters) - Japanese households, with $8.7
trillion in cash and savings, are becoming a bigger target for
foreign currency development bonds, with securities firms hoping
the higher yields and social contributions will attract more
savers.
 Retail investors, used to chronically low domestic returns,
have traditionally been a market for foreign currency debt issued
in Japan, known as uridashi bonds, in particular in higher
yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 Now securities firms are adding a new angle: development
bonds to fund water and ""clean energy"" projects. And they say
investor interest in debt from top-rated international agencies
is weathering turbulence from the euro zone's fiscal problems.
 Last month, Daiwa Securities sold rand and Aussie dollar
bonds from the Asian Development Bank to finance water schemes
and this month it is offering an ""ecology bond"" for the European
Investment Bank to finance projects to prevent climate change.
 It says the two tranches it sold for the ADB, totalling 60
billion yen ($650 million), are the largest of these types of
bonds yet sold in Japan.
 The push has been led by Satoru Yamamoto, Daiwa Securities'
deputy general manager for product planning, who says the debt is
appealing as it is simple for investors to understand and as it
is clear exactly how funds will be used.
 ""Japan has lagged behind in business like this and I would
like to increase it,"" said Yamamoto, 35, who branched into
development bonds after working with the International Finance
Corporation on a microfinance bond project in 2009.
 Uridashi bonds to fund social and environmental projects have
totalled 145 billion yen so far this year, compared with 92
billion yen last year and 44 billion yen in 2008, Daiwa
Securities says.
 The issuance is roughly a third of the broader
foreign-currency uridashi market, where supply for this year
totalled about 436 billion yen by April, according to Reuters
calculations.
 Outflows of Japanese savings into foreign
currency-denominated assets and uridashi bonds have helped push
the yen down in the past and the currency market is watching the
appetite of ordinary Japanese for foreign assets -- although the
tide is not that strong just now, with the yen remaining firm.
 Bond houses say development bonds are attracting new
customers who want top-rated issuers, better returns than they
get domestically, and a sense of making a social contribution.
 ""It would be a lie if I say there is no impact at all from
Greece's fiscal trouble. But from a currency perspective, the
Australian dollar has slipped from its highs, making it easier
for investors to buy these bonds,"" Yamamoto said.
 ""I don't see investors refraining from investment in such
bonds from top-rated issuers so far.""
 IMPORTANT MARKET, YOUNGER INVESTORS
 Households' cash and savings hit a record 803.5 trillion yen
at the end of 2009 and securities firms are trying to tap this
source of funds.
 About 49 billion South African rand, or $6.4 billion, in
uridashi bonds mature this year, and they hope the bonds issued
by big non-sovereign entities will keep people invested.
 Nomura Securities and HSBC have handled bonds supporting
environmental projects this year and Mizuho Securities sold New
Zealand dollar-denominated ""clean energy"" bonds issued by the
African Development Bank (AfDB) in March.
 The AfDB is no stranger to the uridashi market but the bonds
were its first in this field for Japanese retail investors.
 HSBC and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, which both
sold vaccine bonds in 2009, intend to do more of these.
 ""We would like to offer not just bonds with higher coupons
but also an opportunity for customers to get involved in the
world,"" said Kenichi Tatsuzawa, CEO at HSBC Securities in Japan.
 Volatility risk in emerging currencies mean 2- to 3-year
bonds are popular, and the main market is affluent retirees.
 But Daiwa's Yamamoto also wants to attract younger people.
 ""Those who are in their 20s and 30s won't be interested in
uridashis simply with higher yielding currencies,"" he said.
 ""But we can explore the younger generation with bonds which
have a social and environmental character.""

 LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a four-year low
on Monday on sovereign debt worries and fears that planned
belt-tightening measures will hurt euro zone growth, fuelling
concerns the single currency may face free-fall.
 The euro extended its losses after falling below the
post-Lehman October 2008 low around $1.2330, where stop-losses
from model accounts were said to lurk, and fell as far as
$1.2234 on trading platform EBS, its lowest since April 2006.
 It has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar this
month, and is about 14 percent lower for the year, making it the
worst-performing major currency. 
 ""The euro is a one-way trade right now and capitulation is
on my mind. I can see a move towards $1.2000 at least,"" said
Kenneth Broux, market economist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 At 0920 GMT, the euro had clawed its way back to trade at
$1.2310, still down around 0.4 percent on the day. Traders said
volatile trade was impacting liquidity, making for exacerbated
moves.
 Traders reported offers placed around $1.2330, while next
technical analysts noted next support at $1.2175, the 50 percent
retracement of the rally from the all-time lows near $0.82 to
the record highs just above $1.60.
 Analysts said the widening euro zone problems had prompted
a money market dollar liquidity shortage.
 ""If the sharp deterioration in money markets persists into
this week, look for central bank action to lower the cost of
access to their dollar funding facilities,"" Citibank analysts
said in a note.
 A 750 billion euro rescue package from the European Union
and the International Monetary Fund aimed at shoring up euro
zone bond markets has done little to underpin the euro.
 ""Panic is now showing up in the euro currency because it
can't be really expressed in the bond markets after the EU/IMF
package,"" said Stuart Bennett, currency analyst at Credit
Agricole CIB.
 ""Fiscal and economic concerns are likely to weigh on the
euro for the foreseeable future,"" he said.
 On Friday, the single currency euro plunged after European
Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber said it was important not to
underestimate lingering dangers to financial stability.
[ID:nLAG006286].
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday the rescue
plan put together by the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund had only bought time to sort out the yawning gap
between the euro zone's strongest and weakest economies.

 Traders fear the austerity measures announced by Greece,
Spain and Portugal would hurt growth in the near term and force
the European Central Bank to keep rates low in the medium term.
 Data released on Friday showed speculative bets against the
euro hit a record high in the week to May 11. [ID:nN14193796].
 Against the yen, the euro traded down 0.7 percent at 113.80

 LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Stocks steadied and the euro
bounced off four-year lows on Monday as wary European markets
seized on positive company news and bought back into the single
currency on a squeeze of short trading positions.
 Wall Street looked set to open slightly higher after a

to tackle its fundamental problem -- a yawning gap between its
strongest and weakest economies. This had triggered a flight to
safety.
 ""It's been a choppy session in price terms, but Bunds have
gone down because equities turned positive, U.S. Treasuries shed
gains and Bunds were overbought early in the session,"" said a
dealer in London.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up
1.03 percent after oil major BP reported some progress in
containing the oil gushing out of its ruptured well into the
Gulf of Mexico.
 Banks, which have been amongst the biggest losers in the
recent turmoil, were also mostly higher.
 The MSCI All-Country index was down 0.55 percent, with its
more volatile emerging markets component down 1.87 percent.
 Earlier in Japan, the Nikkei had closed at a 10-week low,
down 2.17 percent, mirroring falls in the rest of the region as
investors fretted about prospects for exporters to the West.
 
 EURO ERASES LOSSES
 The euro managed to erase its early losses against the
dollar to trade flat on the day at $1.235, but was still almost
14 percent lower year to date, making it the worst performing
major currency.
 ""The euro is caught between a rock and a hard place at the
moment, and it is hard to see how it can extract itself from
this uncomfortable position in the near term at least,"" said
Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global
Insight in a note. 
 ""Indeed, we suspect that the euro is headed down towards
$1.15 over the coming weeks.""
 Sterling was down 0.7 percent against the dollar to $1.443.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro slid to a four-year low
on Monday on sovereign debt worries and fears that planned
belt-tightening measures will hurt euro zone growth, fuelling
concerns the single currency may face free-fall.
 The euro extended its losses after falling below the October
2008 low at $1.2330, where stop-losses from model accounts were
said to lurk, and fell as far as $1.2234 on trading platform
EBS, its lowest since April 2006.
 It has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar this
month, and is about 14 percent lower for the year, making it the
worst-performing major currency. The euro's next major trough on
charts lies at $1.1640, a low hit in November 2005.
 ""The euro is a one-way trade right now and capitulation is
on my mind. I can see a move towards $1.2000 at least,"" said
Kenneth Broux, market economist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 At 0705 GMT, the euro had clawed its way back to trade at
$1.2310, still down around 0.4 percent on the day. Traders said
volatile trade was impacting liquidity, making for exacerbated
moves. Offers were said to be building above $1.2330.
 Analysts said the widening euro zone problems had prompted
a money market dollar liquidity shortage. 
 ""If the sharp deterioration in money markets persists into
this week, look for central bank action to lower the cost of
access to their dollar funding facilities,"" Citibank analysts
said in a note.
 ""People have no idea what it will take to get out of this
situation as they have seen the euro plunge despite a massive
rescue package,"" said Minoru Shioiri, chief manager of FX
trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. ""There are
very big concerns about the euro zone.""
 A 750 billion euro rescue package from the European Union
and the International Bond Fund aimed at shoring up euro zone
bond markets has done little to underpin the euro. 
 On Friday, the single currency euro plunged after European
Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber said it was important not to
underestimate lingering dangers to financial stability..
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday the rescue
plan put together by the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund had only bought time to sort out the yawning gap
between the euro zone's strongest and weakest economies..
 Traders fear the austerity measures announced by Greece,
Spain and Portugal would hurt growth in the near term and force
the European Central Bank to keep rates low in the medium term.
 Data released on Friday showed speculative bets against the
euro hit a record high in the week to May 11..
 Against the yen, the euro fell more than 1 percent to 112.47
yen, heading closer to an eight-year low of 110.49 yen hit
earlier this month.
 Sterling slid to its lowest since March 2009 at $1.4249
before rising back to $1.4418, still down 0.85 percent on the
day. The pound fell on stop-loss selling and data suggesting the
past year's rise in British house prices may be cooling.
 Weakness in the euro and the pound helped the dollar index,
which rose above 87.00, the highest since March 2009.
 The yen rose broadly, boosted as risk aversion increased.
The Australian and the New Zealand dollars dropped more than 1
percent against the yen.

 * Web of regulations, corruption hamper competitiveness
 * Few precedents for radical overhaul Greece needs
 * Non-euro export exposure may provide lifeline
 
 By Harry Papachristou and Noah Barkin
 ATHENS, May 17 (Reuters) - A concerted export drive in
tandem with a weaker euro may offer the Greek government its
best combination shot at economic salvation as it looks to drag
a country mired in debt and protectionism into a free market
world.
 Hostage to a web of regulations, restrictive laws and
combative unions that plague the entire economy, it carries an
unenviable reputation as one of the worst places to do business
in the western world.
 The speed and scale of the economic transformation Greece is
embarking on have few precedents.
 Economists say developing a wider export base -- especially
outside the euro zone -- will be key to reaching the levels of
growth the cash-strapped country needs to cope with a public
debt expected to swell to 149 percent of GDP in 2013.
 ""Supply-side reforms are the make-or-break for the Greek
economy over the longer term,"" said Ken Watrett, chief euro zone
market economist at BNP Paribas.
 But the impact of the country's deepest recession in almost
four decades, along with a sluggish global recovery, mean any
attempt to force though a brutal austerity plan while
dismantling the special interests that keep large parts of the
economy regulated -- driving up businesses' costs -- is fraught
with risk.
 ""If the economy contracts massively, by more than 4 percent,
reform fatigue could set in,"" said Citigroup economist Giada
Giani.
 
 BUSINESS LAST
 The cruise industry -- which should be thriving against a
natural backdrop of stunning islands and azure seas -- offers a
case in point of why Greece is the European Union's least
competitive economy.
 Restrictions on foreign-flagged cruise ships have capped the
cruise sector's contribution to the economy at about 500 million
euros ($635 million) -- one third of its estimated potential.
 ""It's sheer suicide to be losing that kind of money in the
debt crisis we're in,"" said Michael Nomikos, an agent who works
out of Piraeus port near Athens and represents Royal Caribbean,
the world's number two cruise operator.
 Tackling this competitiveness deficit is the most daunting
challenge facing the socialist government of Prime Minister
George Papandreou as it imposes a painful bout of
belt-tightening in return for 110 billion euros of EU and IMF
aid.
 The country ranked 52nd in a competitiveness survey of 57
developed countries by the International Institute for
Management Development (IMD).
 ""You have to be a patriot to invest in Greece,"" concedes
Konstantinos Mihalos, who runs the Athens Chamber of Commerce.
 Data from the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) shows that Portugal, which has a slightly
smaller population than Greece and an economy that is two thirds
the size, attracted more than twice as much foreign direct
investment on average between 2001 and 2008.
 ""Greece has perhaps the most stringent regulations of any
OECD country,"" Claude Giorno, an OECD expert on Greece, told
Reuters. ""When it comes ... starting a business, public sector
influence (and) ... restrictions on certain professions (means)
it is often dead last.""
 As part of its austerity programme, the government has
promised to introduce laws to simplify licensing procedures and
open up restricted professions such as notaries, accountants,
lawyers and road freight services.
 But it is likely to meet strong resistance from Greeks who
have grown used to a state-driven economy over many decades. If
the government fails to win over the population and implement
its steps quickly, it could struggle to hit the ambitious
economic targets set out in its deal with the EU and IMF.
 Down the line, economists say, that could mean the country
being forced to restructure its debt or even quit the euro zone
and reintroduce its old currency, the drachma.
 
 LOOKING ABROAD
 Exports, which have been made less competitive by the
exorbitant costs of doing business at home, offer another,
potentially more promising route back to growth.
 Greek exports of goods and services accounted for just 24
percent of GDP in 2008, the lowest share in the EU. Consumption,
which will be hardest hit by the austerity measures, made up
more than 70 percent.
 Most exports are in services such as tourism and shipping.
Manufactured exports are generally in low-tech products, such as
food and mineral fuels, where Greece has lost market share to
lower-cost rivals.
 But a silver lining is that the country's fastest growing
export markets are outside the euro zone. Exposure to markets
like Turkey, which is growing faster than EU economies, could be
an advantage, especially if the euro falls further.
 ""Greece does more trade outside the euro zone than within
it, so the falling euro is a help,"" Watrett said.
 Another positive factor for the country is the impact of its
draconian austerity programme on inflation, which has
consistently exceeded the euro area average over the last
decade, also weighing on competitiveness.
 
 A TOUGH ASK
 Precedents for Greece's economic challenge are few and far
between.
 One example cited by economists is Finland, which overhauled
its regulatory regime, privatised state-owned companies and
reformed the tax system as the Soviet Union -- its biggest
export market -- began to collapse.
 But Greece must do in a few short years what it took Finland
half a decade to accomplish without being plagued by the levels
of corruption and waste Greece has.
 Economists say no country in recent history has managed to
slash its deficit and overhaul its economy in such a short time
and under such adverse conditions without devaluing its currency
-- an option Greece doesn't have as a euro area member.
 ""Is it possible that Greece will make it? The short answer
is yes, but if it is likely, that's a different issue,"" Watrett
said.

 * Kroes says firewall a trade barrier to European enterprises
 * Sees younger generation active in tackling censorship
 By Farah Master
 SHANGHAI, May 17 (Reuters) - China's Internet ""firewall"" is a
trade barrier and needs to be tackled within the framework of the
World Trade Organisation, Neelie Kroes, vice-president of the
European Commission, told reporters in Shanghai on Monday.
 Dutch-born Kroes, who is also in charge of Europe's digital
agenda, said the firewall was a trade barrier as long as it
blocked communication for Internet users, preventing the free
flow of information.
 ""It is one of those issues that needs to be tackled within
the WTO,"" said Kroes, who served as European Commissioner for
competition until 2009.
 Kroes spoke at the China headquarters of video-sharing
company Tudou, a rival of Google's  internationally
popular video-sharing platform YouTube that is blocked in China.
 Chinese law requires Internet companies to block or remove
objectionable content, including pornography and any information
deemed sensitive by the ruling Communist Party.
 Social media platforms popular overseas, including Facebook,
YouTube, Twitter and Flickr, are all blocked in China for fear
they will provide a platform to organise or share illicit
information.
""I am pushing wherever I can just to get European enterprises
a level playing field in China and the other way around. It
should be reciprocal,"" she said, adding that the amount of
disruption from the firewall varied for each business.
 The U.S. has also explored taking China's Internet
restrictions to the WTO. In the past, the WTO has upheld China's
right to censor printed and audiovisual content. [ID:nTOE62807S]
 China's more than 400 million Internet users, many of them
young and educated, increasingly spend time online for
entertainment. Despite censorship, the Internet can be a potent
public forum in China, with bloggers and amorphous online groups
hectoring the government over pollution and corruption.
 Kroes said it was significant that companies such as Tudou,
which uploads user videos, show that the younger generation is
taking an active role in tackling censorship.
 Tudou, which adheres to government censorship regulations,
said it deletes 100,000 videos every month for content that
involves pornography or politics.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2010 12:47AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China feels pain of weak euro -official," * Yuan up strongly vs euro, hurting exporters -official
 * Yuan appreciation will not solve global imbalances
(adds quotes, details)
 BEIJING, May 17 (Reuters) - The yuan has risen strongly
against the euro and this appreciation will harm Chinese
exporters, a Commerce Ministry official said on Monday.
 Pegged to a rising dollar, the yuan has appreciated against a
trade-weighted basket of currencies in recent months, which many
analysts believe could constrain the scope for a possible
revaluation of the Chinese currency.
 Commerce Ministry spokesman Yao Jian did not say how dollar
strength might affect a long-awaited move to resume yuan
appreciation, but he highlighted the impact of the weaker euro.
 ""The yuan has risen about 14.5 percent against the euro
during the past four months, which will increase cost pressure
for Chinese exporters and also have a negative impact on China's
exports to European countries,"" he told a news conference.
 The yuan hit its strongest level against the euro
 since late 2002 on Monday as the euro 
tumbled against the dollar on global markets. The yuan was quoted
at 8.3815 against the euro, versus Friday's close of 8.5351.
 With a focus on defending exporters' interests, the Commerce
Ministry is the staunchest opponent of yuan appreciation within
the Chinese government. Beijing has held the yuan at about 6.83
to the dollar since mid-2008, in an attempt to cushion the
economy from the global financial crisis.
 Despite international criticism, Beijing has maintained that
this yuan policy has contributed to global economic stability and
should be decided by itself. Yao reiterated that position.
 ""We should not politicise the yuan issue. It is China's own
business,"" he said. ""Yuan appreciation is not the way to
rebalance the global economy.""
 China's yawning trade surplus was seen as a key global
economic imbalance in the lead-up to the financial crisis, but
the numbers have changed over the past year with the growth of
Chinese imports outpacing that of exports as the domestic economy
booms and other major economies struggle.
 The trade surplus will fall steeply in 2010, Yao said.
 ""This reflects a greater balance in international balance of
payments,"" he said.
 China recorded a $196.1 billion trade surplus last year.
After narrowing surpluses in the first months of 2010, including
a deficit in March, many economists believe the country could be
on course for a surplus of roughly $100 billion this year.

 * Short positions against euro at record highs
 * Sterling marks lowest since March 2009
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro slumped to a four-year low
on Monday, as investors dumped the single currency on sovereign
debt worries and fears that recent belt-tightening measures would
hurt a recovery in the euro zone area.
 The euro extended its losses after falling below $1.2300,
where option barriers were said to lurk, and fell as far as
$1.2234 on trading platform EBS, its lowest since April 2006.
 It has dropped more than 7 percent against the dollar this
month, and is about 14 percent lower for the year, making it the
worst-performing major currency. The euro's next major trough on
charts lies at $1.1640, a low hit in November 2005.
 ""Technically, the euro has been oversold but since the market
is not showing substantial short-covering, players have no choice
but to sell the euro,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 ""Risk aversion stemming from the euro zone fiscal crisis will
likely keep investors shifting their funds into safer assets such
as the dollar, the yen, U.S. Treasuries and gold.""
 There are worries about the health of European banks which
have exposure to sovereign bonds in Greece and some other euro
zone nations with high fiscal deficits, the trader added.
 On Friday, the euro had plunged to its lowest level against
the dollar since late October 2008 with losses deepening after
European Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber saying that it was
important not to underestimate lingering dangers to financial
stability..
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on the Sunday the $1
trillion rescue plan stitched together by the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund only bought time to sort out the
yawning gap between the euro zone's strongest and weakest
economies..
 Last week the currency had briefly rallied towards $1.31
after the rescue package was announced before worries about the
euro zone's growth outlook came back into focus. Traders fear
that the austerity measures announced by Greece, Spain and
Portugal would hurt growth in the near term and force the
European Central Bank to keep rates low in the medium term.
 An analyst said the euro looked to have further to fall given
the relative weakness of the EU's growth outlook compared with
the United States.
 ""This suggests EUR/USD should be trading below, or at least
closer to, its long-run fair-value, which we estimate at around
$1.2100,"" said Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Mike
Jones.
 Data released Friday showed speculative bets against the euro
hit a record high in the week to May 11..
 Against the yen, the euro fell 1.4 percent to 112.74 yen,
heading closer to an eight-year low of 110.49 yen hit earlier
this month.
 Sterling slid to its lowest level since March 2009 at $1.4249
before edging back to $1.4300, down 1.7 percent on the day. The
pound fell on stop-loss selling and data suggesting that the past
year's rise in British house prices may be cooling.
 British newspaper reports saying Britain's new government was
critical of the previous Labour-Party administration's fiscal
policies, weighed on sterling, market players said.
 Britain's new government has inherited ""fiddled"" public
finances, new Finance Minister George Osborne told the Financial
Times in an interview published on Monday.
 Separately, the Sunday Times online edition reported that the
British government has accused Labour of pursuing a ""scorched
earth policy"" before the general election, leaving behind
billions of pounds of previously hidden spending commitments.
 All the weakness in the euro and the pound were helping the
dollar index, which rose above 87.00, the highest since March
2009.
 Yen crosses broadly fell with the Australian and the New
Zealand dollars dropping more than 1 percent..
 Dollar/yen dropped 0.6 percent to to 91.92 yen.
 There was little market impact from comments by Fitch ratings
saying it had not taken any action on Japan's sovereign rating on
Monday and that the outlook for the rating is stable, or from
earlier rumours that Fitch may downgrade Japan's rating.
 ""We have not taken any rating action on Japan this morning.
The foreign currency rating is AA, and its outlook is stable. The
local currency rating is AA-minus and the outlook is stable,""
said Vincent Ho, sovereign rating analyst at Fitch ratings.

 By Koh Gui Qing
 SYDNEY, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro sank to four-year lows
on Monday as angst over Europe's debt crisis led investors to
pull more money from stocks in favour of havens such as gold
and Asian bonds.
 So sour was the mood that markets seemed to take scant
notice of a slew of encouraging economic data from the United
States, Japan and Singapore. [ID:nN14138390] [ID:nTOE64G008]
[ID:nSGE64C0FF]
 Financial bookmakers expect European stocks to suffer too,
with Britain's, German and French stock indices <.FTSE>
<.GDAXI> <.FCHI> seen opening down between 0.4-1.2 percent.
 ""The market has gone into fear mode, and we're seeing red
across the board,"" said Justin Smirk, chief economist at St
George Bank in New Zealand.
 The euro  fell 0.7 percent from Friday's close to
$1.2293 as investors doubted fiscally weaker euro zone nations
can tighten their belts, or do so without stunting growth.
Charts suggest the currency may extend losses to $1.23, then
$1.2190.
 With bets against the euro at an all-time high [IMM/FX],
traders said the currency looked weak as ever although a brief
bounce on short-covering in the near term could not be ruled
out.
 Worryingly, there are signs that anxiety over Europe was
squeezing credit markets, mirroring the days of the financial
crisis when anxious investors and banks hoarded cash.
 The tense mood hammered Asian stocks. Japan's Nikkei
<.N225> shed 2.2 percent, and South Korea's stock index <.KS11>
lost 2.6 percent. The MSCI measure of Asia-Pacific markets
outside of Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> dropped 3.6 percent to head
for its worse day in nine months.
 ""The worry is really that the fiscal situation in the
southern European states will hit the European economy, and
then the global economy,"" said Takashi Ushio, head of the
investment strategy division at Marusan Securities in Japan.
 ""This would affect exporters not only in Japan but also
China as well, raising fears that Chinese economic growth could
cool too.
 Shanghai's stock index <.SSEC>, among the world's
worse-performing stock indices this year due to expectations of
monetary policy tightening, dived 4.1 percent.
 While there is speculation that China could revalue the
yuan in a much-awaited move over the next few days before a
China-U.S. summit, choppy markets have led some analysts to
argue that China may hold off for now.
 Thai stocks <.SETI>, rocked by escalating violence in the
country, fell to a one-month low. [ID:nSGE64G05P]
[ID:nSGE64G00Y]
 The downbeat mood in markets benefitted the U.S. dollar.
It's measure against a basket of currencies was strong near
15-month highs at 86.9 <.DXY> as investors favoured the safety
of its liquidity.
 A stronger U.S. dollar weighed on commodity prices. Oil
 hit its lowest level in over three months, and copper
futures eased too. Shanghai copper touched three-month lows.
[MET/L]
 In reflection of sluggish metal prices, material stocks
were among the hardest hit. Australian-listed global miners BHP
Billiton  and Rio Tinto  shed 4.3 percent and
5.5 percent respectively.
 STRENGTH OF EU-ASIA LINKS?
 Thomson Reuters data suggested the euro's tumble fuelled
selling in Asian stocks. The correlation between the MSCI index
and the euro-U.S. dollar rate stood at a strong 0.92, up
sharply from around 0.20 a few weeks ago.
 Perfect correlation stands at 1 and it means two assets
move in tandem.
 Yet, many economists argued real economic links between
Asia and Europe were not strong enough for Europe's problems to
scupper Asian growth.
 ""Sure, Europe is again the single biggest market for Asia.
But the rest of the world is still a substantially larger buyer
of Asian products,"" HSBC said in a note to clients.
 ""And it is here that in recent years all the action has
happened in terms of growth.""
 Yet, all said, rising funding costs in credit markets
suggest Asia is not insulated from Europe's turmoil.
 Three-month Libor  and Euribor rates
 have crept higher after failing to pull back in
the wake of the mammoth $1 trillion euro zone aid deal struck a
week ago.
 The rates, which measure borrowing costs between banks and
reflect credit risks, are at eight- and four-month highs
respectively.
 Underscoring the extent of anxiety in markets, gold held up
despite the firm U.S. dollar at $1,237.60 an ounce, within
earshot of a record high of $1,248.95. It hit a record high
when priced in euro. [GOL/]
 Safe-haven government bonds were also in demand. Benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasuries surged, and Japanese five-year yields

 By Koh Gui Qing
 SYDNEY, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro sank to four-year lows
on Monday as angst over Europe's debt crisis led investors to
pull more money from stocks in favour of havens such as gold
and Asian bonds.
 So sour was the mood that markets seemed to take scant
notice of a slew of encouraging economic data from the United
States, Japan and Singapore. [ID:nN14138390] [ID:nTOE64G008]
[ID:nSGE64C0FF]
 Financial bookmakers expect European stocks to suffer too,
with Britain's, German and French stock indices <.FTSE>
<.GDAXI> <.FCHI> seen opening down between 0.4-1.2 percent.
 ""The market has gone into fear mode, and we're seeing red
across the board,"" said Justin Smirk, chief economist at St
George Bank in New Zealand.
 The euro  fell 0.7 percent from Friday's close to
$1.2293 as investors doubted fiscally weaker euro zone nations
can tighten their belts, or do so without stunting growth.
Charts suggest the currency may extend losses to $1.23, then
$1.2190.
 With bets against the euro at an all-time high [IMM/FX],
traders said the currency looked weak as ever although a brief
bounce on short-covering in the near term could not be ruled
out.
 Worryingly, there are signs that anxiety over Europe was
squeezing credit markets, mirroring the days of the financial
crisis when anxious investors and banks hoarded cash.
 The tense mood hammered Asian stocks. Japan's Nikkei
<.N225> shed 2.2 percent, and South Korea's stock index <.KS11>
lost 2.6 percent. The MSCI measure of Asia-Pacific markets
outside of Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> dropped 3.6 percent to head
for its worse day in nine months.
 ""The worry is really that the fiscal situation in the
southern European states will hit the European economy, and
then the global economy,"" said Takashi Ushio, head of the
investment strategy division at Marusan Securities in Japan.
 ""This would affect exporters not only in Japan but also
China as well, raising fears that Chinese economic growth could
cool too.
 Shanghai's stock index <.SSEC>, among the world's
worse-performing stock indices this year due to expectations of
monetary policy tightening, dived 4.1 percent.
 While there is speculation that China could revalue the
yuan in a much-awaited move over the next few days before a
China-U.S. summit, choppy markets have led some analysts to
argue that China may hold off for now.
 Thai stocks <.SETI>, rocked by escalating violence in the
country, fell to a one-month low. [ID:nSGE64G05P]
[ID:nSGE64G00Y]
 The downbeat mood in markets benefitted the U.S. dollar.
It's measure against a basket of currencies was strong near
15-month highs at 86.9 <.DXY> as investors favoured the safety
of its liquidity.
 A stronger U.S. dollar weighed on commodity prices. Oil
 hit its lowest level in over three months, and copper
futures eased too. Shanghai copper touched three-month lows.
[MET/L]
 In reflection of sluggish metal prices, material stocks
were among the hardest hit. Australian-listed global miners BHP
Billiton  and Rio Tinto  shed 4.3 percent and
5.5 percent respectively.
 STRENGTH OF EU-ASIA LINKS?
 Thomson Reuters data suggested the euro's tumble fuelled
selling in Asian stocks. The correlation between the MSCI index
and the euro-U.S. dollar rate stood at a strong 0.92, up
sharply from around 0.20 a few weeks ago.
 Perfect correlation stands at 1 and it means two assets
move in tandem.
 Yet, many economists argued real economic links between
Asia and Europe were not strong enough for Europe's problems to
scupper Asian growth.
 ""Sure, Europe is again the single biggest market for Asia.
But the rest of the world is still a substantially larger buyer
of Asian products,"" HSBC said in a note to clients.
 ""And it is here that in recent years all the action has
happened in terms of growth.""
 Yet, all said, rising funding costs in credit markets
suggest Asia is not insulated from Europe's turmoil.
 Three-month Libor  and Euribor rates
 have crept higher after failing to pull back in
the wake of the mammoth $1 trillion euro zone aid deal struck a
week ago.
 The rates, which measure borrowing costs between banks and
reflect credit risks, are at eight- and four-month highs
respectively.
 Underscoring the extent of anxiety in markets, gold held up
despite the firm U.S. dollar at $1,237.60 an ounce, within
earshot of a record high of $1,248.95. It hit a record high
when priced in euro. [GOL/]
 Safe-haven government bonds were also in demand. Benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasuries surged, and Japanese five-year yields
hit five-month lows. [US/] [JP/]

1184,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2010 09:23PM ET</span>",Cuba cedes to farmers right to purchase supplies," * Farmers to purchase supplies at Municipal markets
 * System of state centrally assigning supplies junked
 By Marc Frank
 HAVANA, May 16 (Reuters) - Cuba's private farmers will
purchase supplies directly in future instead of having them
allocated by the state, the government said on Sunday, in the
latest concession to their demands for more autonomy.
 Economy Minister Marino Murillo made the announcement at
the close of a congress of Cuba's 350,000 family farmers and
members of private cooperatives, the largest private sector in
the communist country where the state controls most economic
activity.
 The farmers, who account for 70 percent of the food
produced in Cuba using just 41 percent of the land, had pushed
for more freedom to sell their produce and obtain supplies
during meetings across the country before the congress.
 At issue are regulations guaranteeing the state's near
monopoly of the agricultural system through a long-standing
practice of contracting for 75 percent of farmers' production
in return for fuel, pesticides, fertilizer and other supplies.
 The government had approved plans to modernize the economy
and ""create in the majority of municipalities supply markets
where farmers can acquire directly the necessary resources to
produce, substituting the current system of assigning resources
centrally,"" Murillo said.
 He said there were no plans to eliminate the state's
monopoly on food sales. But, various farmers and cooperatives
spoke during the congress about how they were selling more of
their products directly to consumers and institutions such as
schools and hospitals with positive results.
 Raul Castro, who attended the closing session of he
congress, has made food security his signature issue since
taking over the presidency from older brother Fidel Castro two
years ago. The semi-tropical island imports 60 percent of its
consumed food, a huge burden on its fragile economy.
 Castro has boosted what the state pays for produce, leased
state lands to farmers, decentralized decision-making and
allowed some farmers to sell a small part of their produce
directly to consumers at fixed prices.
 The reforms spurred production last year of bumper crops of
tomatoes, garlic and other food, but that has not happened this
year.
 In meetings before the congress, farmers said recent
production has fallen, partly because the state did not provide
fertilizer and pesticides on time. It also failed to get all of
their produce to market the past two years, they said.
 Government statistics indicate that sugar, coffee and
citrus production are at all-time lows, and non-sugar
agriculture was down 13 percent through March.

 By Gyles Beckford
 WELLINGTON, May 17 (Reuters) - The euro hit fresh 18-month
lows on Monday, as investors dumped the single currency on
sovereign debt worries and fears that recent belt-tightening
measures would hurt a recovery in the euro zone area.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was at $1.2362, compared with
$1.2368 late in New York on Friday when it fell nearly 1.3
percent. It has fallen more than 7 percent against the U.S.
dollar so far this month, and is nearly 14 percent lower for the
year, making it the worst-performing major currency.
 Traders say sentiment towards the euro is bearish and if the
single currency breaks below $1.2329, it will be the lowest in
four-years. There is talk of option barriers at $1.23, a level
which is likely to be defended in Asian trade.

on Friday since late October 2008 with losses deepening after
European Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber saying that it was

stability. [ID:nLAG006286].
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on the Sunday the $1
trillion rescue plan stitched together by the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund only bought time to sort out the
yawning gap between the euro zone's strongest and weakest
economies. [nLDE64F0FQ].
 Last week the currency had briefly rallied towards $1.31
after the rescue package was announced before worries about the
euro zone's growth outlook came back into focus. Traders fear
that the austerity measures announced by Greece, Spain and
Portugal would hurt growth in the near term and force the
European Central Bank to keep rates low in the medium term.
 An analyst said the euro looked to have further to fall given
the relative weakness of the EU's growth outlook compared with
the United States.
 ""This suggests EUR/USD should be trading below, or at least
closer to, its long-run fair-value, which we estimate at around
$1.2100,"" said Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Mike
Jones.
 Data released Friday showed speculative bets against the euro

 The euro was also lower against other major currencies
slipping briefly below 114 yen  before lifting to settle
around 114.06.
 Sterling was also softer, falling to its lowest level in a
year at $1.4470 , from Friday's $1.4557. The pound fell
on stop-loss selling and data suggesting that the past year's
rise in British house prices may be cooling.
 All the weakness in the euro and the pound were helping the
dollar index <.DXY>, which rose to its highest in 13-months,
rising to as high as 86.31. Dollar/yen  was broadly steady
at 92.31 yen, having lost 0.4 percent on Friday.

(Adds fresh Medvedev comments on energy, relations)
 By Denis Dyomkin
 MOSCOW, May 16 (Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
visits Kiev this week on an almost impossible mission: talking
Ukraine into surrendering control of its cherished gas pipeline
system to Russian energy giant Gazprom.
 The proposal by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin last
month was far from welcomed in Ukraine, which is eager to retain
control of a network that serves as a conduit for 80 percent of
Russian gas supplies to the European Union.
 ""It (Putin's offer) was an unexpected step for Ukraine and
it does not mean that this question will be considered by
Ukraine and resolved,"" Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich's
press service quoted him as saying earlier this month.
 Striking a more conciliatory tone, Medvedev told Ukrainian
television Russia also wanted to merge some gas and gas
transmission assets, but that would require the agreement of
both ex-Soviet neighbours.
 ""This seems completely possible to me, taking into account
both parties' wishes,"" Medvedev said in comments recorded on
Saturday.
 Yanukovich's reluctance is a sign the rapprochement between
Kiev and Moscow has its limits, though the two leaders are
expected to sign agreements on border demarcation, nuclear
cooperation, aircraft development and other matters.
 Since Yanukovich's election in February, ties with Moscow
have rapidly improved with accords on gas pricing and a lease
extension for a key Russian naval base on Ukraine's Crimea
peninsula already signed.
 
 CROWN JEWEL
 Russia has long coveted Naftogaz's pipeline network, which
is part of the Soviet-era system that supplied natural gas to
Eastern Bloc allies as well as clients on the other side of the
Iron Curtain.
 The issue has become more acute in recent years after Russia
cut or reduced gas supplies on several occasions during pricing
and storage disputes with the state-owned Ukrainian gas company.
 Earlier this year, Yanukovich's government proposed the
creation of a gas consortium with Russia and the European Union
that would modernise the ageing pipelines, though this has yet
to come to fruition.
 But Putin's proposal to merge Gazprom and Naftogaz appears
to be a step too far for Ukrainian politicians.
 Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Andriy Klyuev has also
ruled out any energy deals with Russia during Medvedev's visit
next week.
 ""No sensations are expected,"" Ukraine's presidential chief
of staff, Sergiy Levochkin, told reporters in Kiev when asked
about the possible outcome of the Russian-Ukrainian talks.
 The head of Kiev-based political think-tank Penta, Volodymyr
Fesenko, told Reuters that Yanukovich was not keen on Russia's
proposals and instead promptly proposed the involvement of
European Union in the possible deal.
 Medvedev urged Ukraine to be cautious in seeking to join the
European Union, given the bloc's current economic woes.
 ""If the Ukrainian people want to push for EU membership,
that is your choice,"" he said.
 ""In any case I would carefully track what happens in the EU
because one should aim towards things that are good and calm.
And now our European colleagues still need to cope with those
difficulties they are experiencing, including the euro zone.""
 While the chance of a gas merger looks remote, progress on
nuclear cooperation is likely during Medvedev's visit to Kiev.
 Putin has separately suggested unifying assets in the
nuclear energy industry and said Russia might lend $5-6 billion
to its ex-Soviet neighbour to build two new nuclear reactors at
its Rivne and Khmelnytsky plants.
 ""We are now working on these contracts. The conditions are a
straightforward loan and no transfer of property,"" Ukraine's
first deputy prime minister Klyuev said on May 12.

 * Analysts say nuclear row deterring Western investors
 * Iran shifting to Asia and elsewhere
 * Major oil producer needs investment in energy sector
(Adds byline, Lula quote)
 By Fernando Exman
 TEHRAN, May 16 (Reuters) - Brazil will finance one billion
Euros of food exports to Iran over the next five years to make
trade between the two countries less dependent on foreign banks,
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Sunday.
 Lula is in Tehran to help mediate in a standoff over Iran's
nuclear programme, as Brazil seeks more diplomatic clout on the
world stage. It is seen as probably the last chance to avoid a
new round of U.N. sanctions against the major oil producer.
 ""It does not make sense that the trade between Iranian and
Brazilian companies depends on the credit and goodwill of
foreign banks,"" Lula said in a speech to Iranian and Brazilian
traders.
 The United States is pushing for a fourth round of punitive
sanctions, including measures targeting Iranian banks and
shipping, over its refusal to suspend enrichment-related
activity seen by the West as part of a programme to develop
nuclear weapons.
 Iran says its nuclear program is soley to produce
electricity.
 Behrouz Alishiri, head of an Iranian government body
promoting investment in the Islamic state, said on Sunday trade
between Iran and Brazil could increase nearly five-fold to some
$10 billion, but he did not give a time frame.
 Analysts say Western companies are increasingly wary of
investing in Iran because of the nuclear dispute and that Tehran
is shifting to countries from Asia and elsewhere to develop its
oil and gas fields. It has also boosted ties with Latin America.
 
 OIL SECTOR MODERNISATION
 The head of Brazil's energy regulator said in Tehran on
Saturday the two countries were likely to sign a memorandum
which would open the way for Brazilian firms to participate in
the modernisation of Iran's oil sector.
 Alishiri told an economic conference attended by
representatives from the two countries that Iran offered high
returns for foreign investors.
 He suggested that Brazilian companies could buy stakes in
Iranian state firms to be privatised and also take part in
planned bond offerings to help finance energy sector projects.
 ""Attaining $10 billion in trade exchanges between Iran and
Brazil is not far-fetched,"" Alishiri said, according to state
broadcaster IRIB.
 ""Iran has the highest return on capital in the world,
ranging (between) 25-85 percent in some projects. We have no
limitation in foreign investment, and welcome Brazil's
investment in Iran,"" he said.
 State radio said bilateral trade had increased to more than
$2 billion in the 2009-10 year from $500 million in 2005, and
was forecast to reach some $10 billion in the next 5 years.
 Haroldo Lima, the head of Brazil's energy regulator, told
Reuters on Saturday that his country could help Iran with
equipment and engineering. In exchange, Iran could provide
Brazil with drills to help in the exploration of deep-water oil.
 Lima said the Iranians had urged Brazilian companies to take
part in the privatisation of some of Iran's refineries.

 By Bate Felix
 BRUSSELS, May 16 (Reuters) - The Europe Union will seek to
conclude trade agreements with several Latin American countries
and revive stalled negotiations with others when some 60
European and Latin America countries meet this week in Madrid.
 The summit between European and Latin American heads of
states, which takes place every two years, has been overshadowed
by boycott threats from some South American countries over the
participation of Honduran President Porfirio Lobo.
 Many South American nations except Colombia and Peru
consider Lobo illegitimate following his election in a vote
organised by backers of a 2009 coup which deposed former
president Manuel Zelaya.
 However, Luiz Inacio Da Silva, leader of South America's
economic powerhouse Brazil, and Argentine President Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner are expected to attend. Venezuela's Hugo
Chavez said on Friday he was skipping the event, but have no
reason for his decision.
 EU diplomats said the bloc would formally launch a Latin
American Investment Facility worth about 225 million euros
($285.8 million), to leverage investment on projects in the
region.
 The financial instrument is tailored like the EU's
investment facility for its eastern neighbours, which through
grants of 71 million euros, supports projects worth around 2.7
billion euros.
 
 STALLED TRADE TALKS
 The 27-nation European Union and the Mercosur group made up
of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay plan to formally
revive stalled trade negotiations begun more than a decade ago,
which were suspended in 2004 over trade differences.
 Mercosur countries said then that they were not satisfied
with the EU's agricultural market access offer, while the EU
complained about the lack of proposals from the Mercosur group
to open its telecoms market and to protect EU industries. 
 EU diplomats said the bloc would pursue a trade deal with
the Mercosur group despite concerns on the part of France and
some other EU states that this could harm their agricultural
sectors.
 ""Mercosur is an important economic bloc, protected, emerging
and has potentially many economic values for the EU and does not
have a free trade agreement with any other country,"" an EU
diplomat said.
 ""The negotiations will be very difficult, this is very
clear. Mercosur is one of the most competitive agricultural
producers in the world and very competitive on products that we
produce in Europe.""
 Slow progress of the Doha round of world trade talks has
pushed Brussels to seek regional trade agreements. The EU is
also seeking to counter China's expansion into a region that is
expected to grow by between 4.0 to 4.5 percent this year.
 Apart from the Mercosur deal, the EU is hoping to sign an
agreement with Colombia and Peru, and conclude another trade
deal with Central American states.
 Negotiations between the EU and Panama, Guatemala, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua collapsed last week
after the parties failed to agree on a number of issues,
including imports of dairy products.
 Diplomats said the parties were meeting this weekend and
hoped to have an agreement before the summit on Tuesday.

 * Reform key to cutting 20 pct unemployment, boosting growth
 * Hiring, firing costs likely cut, but not dramatically
(updates with opinion poll)
 By Elisabeth O'Leary
 MADRID, May 16 (Reuters) - Spain's long-awaited jobs reform,
likely this week, will cut the cost of hiring and firing but may
not provide enough flexibility to erase financial markets'
doubts about the economy in the longer term, economists said.
 The reform is key to Spain's ability to create jobs, pay
down its debts and build up muscle to turn around an economy
which shrank 3.6 percent year-on-year in 2009. [ID:nLDE62T10B
 But after a week in which the government announced an
austerity plan which it had spent months denying was necessary,
some believe that Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero has finally woken up.
 That could mean the kind of measures which cut the cost of
firing fixed workers, and some relief for financial markets
worried about the size and cost of Spain's debt, as the nation's
ability to create work and boost tax revenues rises.
 ""For the first time the government has shown that it is
willing to assume the political cost of government and start
taking unpopular decisions,"" said Javier Diaz-Gimenez, Economics
Professor at Madrid's IESE Business School.
 ""But they won't have the courage to go all the way and
create one employment contract,"" he said, adding that he was
expecting the government to cut the cost of firing fixed workers
to above 8 days -- possibly to about 20 days -- from 45 days per
year worked, and with a time limit.
 That could cut the yield on Spanish 10-year Treasury bonds
just as the austerity plan did last week.
 The political cost of Zapatero's measures became more
evident on Sunday, when an opinion poll showed the conservative
opposition has more than doubled its lead over the Socialists
since the measures were announced.
 
 DUAL CONTRACTS HOLD ECONOMY BACK
 One in five people in Spain are unemployed, double the euro
zone rate and double the number two years ago. There are also
1.3 million households in which not one member has a job.
 Spain especially needs to get rid of a crippling two-tier
jobs market, where the cost of sacking those with fixed
contracts is among the highest in Europe. Meanwhile, firing
those on temporary contracts costs next to nothing.
 ""I expect some flexibilisation (of the jobs market),"" said
Jose Zarate, economist at 4Cast in London.
 ""(But) markets want a labour reform along the lines of the
UK and that is not going to happen. So they will not be
pleased.""
 Unemployment is also 40 percent among the young, while older
workers take up the bulk of fixed contracts with damaging
potential consequences for productivity.
 ""The result of not pushing ahead with this could be
catastrophic,"" Zarate said, referring to the spillover effects
of high unemployment -- depressed consumption, lower government
revenues via income taxes and higher expenditure in benefits.
 Labour reform talks between unions and employers have taken
months because of clashing demands, especially over firing
costs, and Zapatero's unwillingness -- until now -- to push
them.
 But that has changed under new pressure from the EU and
market jitters about the euro and its members following the
fallout from the Greek bailout package. The reform appears to be
close to agreement, with media reporting this weekend that
Zapatero last week gave them a 10-day ultimatum.
 The danger might be that, in its haste to present the
markets with something, the government pushes through a
blueprint which initially looks good but then becomes weak.
 ""Labour reform will be done under pressure and will be a
low-quality affair, something that in the longer term will have
to be modified,"" said Josep Soler, Economist and Director at
Barcelona business school IEF.
 ""Initially the market reaction will be positive ... and then
when people realise that measures do nothing to boost
employment, it will respond badly,"" he said.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2010 10:26AM ET</span>",EXCLUSIVE-Trade finance still a worry despite recovery," * Trade finance scarce for developing countries
 * Expensive where available
 * Risk factors outweigh supply of funds
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 16 (Reuters) - Trade finance, vital to keep the
wheels of international trade turning, remains a concern for
poor countries in Africa and other regions, even as global
commerce rebounds in the recovery, trade finance sources said.
 Practitioners in the $10 trillion market are now talking to
regulators to ensure that efforts to stop banks hiding toxic
assets do not make it harder and costlier to extend trade
finance, traditionally one of the safest forms of credit.
 The World Trade Organization will host a meeting of trade
finance bankers, international financial institutions and
regulators on May 18 to monitor the state of the market ahead of
the G20 summit in Toronto next month.
 That follows a progress report on the $250 billion trade
finance package agreed at the G20 summit in London in April last
year that was submitted to G20 finance ministers at last month's
International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Washington.
 ""There is continuous concern about this issue,"" said one
trade finance expert.
 The Toronto summit will be asked to target remaining
resources in the package at African and other borrowers still
cut off from trade finance, he said.
 Some 90 percent of the $12 trillion in trade in merchandise
goods is underpinned by trade finance -- typically short-term
self-liquidating credits in use for centuries that have much
lower default rates than other types of loan.
 The credit crunch in 2008 caused trade finance to dry up
too, spurring a slump in trade, although the 12.2 percent
contraction in trade in 2009 reflected lower demand rather than
a shortage of funding over the year as a whole.
 The WTO now forecasts trade will rebound by 9.5 percent this
year. Surveys show finance is available for trade between rich
nations and countries around the Pacific, including China.
 The concern is that this recovery has not yet reached
smaller banks in Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Latin
America, with 30-40 countries still having difficulties.
 
 CREDIT RISK
 One problem is that many countries have suffered credit
rating downgrades, forcing banks to set aside more capital under
prudential regulations to cover loans to borrowers in those
countries. The rules state that an individual borrower's
creditworthiness can never be better than the country's rating.
 Trade finance deals for oil-rich Angola are paying 40-50
percent interest at an annual rate, and Mexico is paying 20
percent after a downgrade, the trade finance expert said.
 Looked at another way, one major trade finance bank is now
charging for a three-month trade finance deal in Kenya --
Africa's best credit risk -- a spread of 320 basis points, or
3.2 percentage points, over banks' costs of borrowing, plus
requiring export credit insurance adding another 300 basis
points, and requiring cash collateral of 50 percent, he said.
 Before the crisis a Kenyan borrower would have paid a spread
of less than 100 basis points over interbank rates.
 Studies by the WTO and African Development Bank suggest that
export financing is available for African countries from
institutions such as pan-African lender Ecobank Transnational
 or South Africa's Standard Bank , although at
higher costs and for smaller volumes than before the crisis.
 But trade financing -- often the only form of international
credit available to African countries -- to cover imports from
fuel to machinery has dried up for smaller banks.
 The risk is that firms in these countries that entered the
formal economy with access to bank credit will be forced back
into the informal sector, hitting the state's tax base.
 The G20 report found that halfway through the two-year life
of the $250 billion package, $188 billion has been mobilised and
$110 billion disbursed, with banks unable to find enough
creditworthy borrowers to use all the money available.
 ""They're telling you the problem is less one of liquidity
than of risk,"" the trade finance expert said.
 Besides counterparty risk, one question that bankers will
want to discuss at the May 18 meeting with regulators from the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is the treatment of trade
finance instruments, such as letters of credit.
 These are traditionally held off banks' balance sheets while
the details of importer, exporter and shipper are being checked
because they are not a firm commitment until the last minute --
and some 75 percent are rejected during verification.
 But proposed new banking regulations to prevent banks hiding
toxic assets off their balance sheets would cover unconfirmed
trade finance instruments too, driving up their cost.
 ""Clearly trade finance is not at the root of the financial
crisis -- you are not leveraging by using standby letters of
credit,"" the trade finance expert said.
 Together with the International Chamber of Commerce, the 10
biggest banks in the sector with portfolios of up to $300-400
billion are preparing a database of trade finance default rates
to demonstrate to regulators the relative safety of the credits.
 Banks invited to the May 18 meeting include HSBC ,
Citibank , BNP Paribas , Standard Chartered
 and Brazilian development bank BNDES.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2010 10:24AM ET</span>",S.Korea state think-tank urges interest rate hike," SEOUL, May 16 (Reuters) - South Korea's top state-run
economic think-tank on Sunday raised this year's economic
growth forecast for the second time in six months and urged the
central bank to start normalising its low interest rate policy.
 The Korea Development Institute (KDI) said the country's
economy would grow 5.9 percent this year, which would be the
fastest pace in eight years and above the central bank's own
upgraded growth forecast of 5.2 percent.
 KDI last raised its 2010 growth forecast last November to
5.5 percent from 4.2 percent. Asia's fourth-largest economy
expanded by just 0.2 percent in 2009 as the global economic
downturn suppressed activity.
 ""In monetary policy, (the central bank) needs to promote
normalisation of the low-interest rate policy stance in
consideration of the changing environment such as a possible
rise in consumer price (growth),"" it said in a report.
 KDI said inflation in 2010 would be 3 percent, higher than
its previous forecast of 2.7 percent.
 As the most influential economic institute in South Korea,
the government takes its forecasts into account when setting
policy.
 The Bank of Korea has kept its interest rate at a record
low of 2 percent for the past 15 months, but it signalled on
Wednesday it was preparing for a rate rise with upbeat comments
on the economy and inflation following a policy review.
[ID:nTOE64B017]
 Analysts estimated the rate rise will occur in the next
quarter.
 The Finance Ministry, which has forecast GDP will rise this
year by 5 percent, has argued it is too early to raise interest
rates.
 The Bank of Korea slashed its benchmark 7-day repurchase
agreement rate  by 3.25 percentage points between
late 2008 and early 2009 to help protect the export-geared
economy from the global downturn.
 With Asia leading the world in recovering from the global
downturn, several regional central banks, including those in
Australia, Malaysia and India, have started raising interest
rates from the low levels set during the crisis.

 * New Zealand dollar falls after retail sales disappoint
 * Dollar index strong near 13-mth highs
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, May 14 (Reuters) - The euro was struggling on Friday,
holding above 14-month lows against the U.S. dollar as concerns
about anaemic growth in the euro zone dragged it lower, while
worries about Britain's public finances undermined the pound.
 In Asian trade, the battered euro  was at $1.2535,
barely changed from levels last seen in New York on Thursday when
it lost nearly 0.7 percent.
 Traders said the euro was likely to be defended around the
$1.25 level on talk of some large option barriers around there.
Still, the outlook for the euro was bearish with investors
nervous over the commitment and resolve of EU member states to
make significant inroads in consolidating fiscal positions.
 On the other hand, encouraging data from the U.S. and
expectations that the Federal Reserve will be the first to move
amongst the major central banks to raise interest rates,
supported the U.S. dollar.
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> was at 85.36, near a 13-month
high, in part boosted by inflows from investors fleeing the euro
zone and in part driven by expectations that the recovery in the
U.S. was on much solid ground. [ID:nN13233348].
 ""I think we are at the point where, whichever way you think
the world is going to go - boom or bust - the dollar index will
probably head higher,"" said Adam Carr, senior economist at ICAP.
 ""It's already had a solid run, but love for the euro is
almost non-existent at the moment and the U.S. economy is staging
a decent bounce back. I don't know know if there is a near term
catalyst to change the euro's fortunes.""
 Indeed, investors were of the view that the harsh fiscal
tightening in Europe would dampen an already-weak recovery.
Traders say, if the euro breaks below $1.25, stop-loss selling
could see it push toward $1.2330, its October 2008 low.
 The euro was down on the yen at 116.18 yen, having shed 1.3
percent  on Thursday. The dollar was marginally higher
on the yen, rising to 92.70 yen from 92.60 yen  late on
Thursday.
 Sterling  was on the defensive below $1.46, having
shed 1.4 percent on Thursday , hurt by data showing the
UK goods trade deficit widened more than expected in March.
[ID:nONS006657].
 That came after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said
weaker euro zone export markets had increased growth risks for
the British economy.
 Meanwhile, the New Zealand dollar  fell around a
third of a cent to $0.7120 from $0.7150/55 after first quarter
retail sales numbers disappointed. Seasonally adjusted retail
sales volumes, rose 0.2 percent in the March period, compared
with a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.3 percent increase.
The Australian dollar  was steady at $0.8961, but off
Thursday's high of $0.9026 reached after stronger-than-expected
Australian employment data.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2010 09:48AM ET</span>",U.S. should deter foreign mining in Eritrea-report,"* Accuses Eritrea of religious freedom abuses
 * Calls for hardening of U.S. policy
 * Eritrea denies abuses, foreign miners reject call
 
 By Jeremy Clarke
 NAIROBI, May 13 (Reuters) - Mining companies should be
deterred from working in Eritrea and banned from raising capital
or listing their securities in the United States due to
Eritrea's rights abuse record, a U.S.-commissioned report said.
The United States Commission on International Religious
Freedom (USCIRF) said Eritrea's systematic violation of
religious freedoms should mean prohibitive restrictions for
foreign firms joining the nation's impending gold mining boom.
 Some 16 foreign mining companies are operating in the Red
Sea state. Canada's Nevsun Resources Ltd is expected to be the
first to start producing gold later this year, followed some 12
months later by Australia's Chalice Gold Mines.
 No U.S.-based mining company is operating in the country but
analysts say an aggressive stance in Washington would heap
pressure on Australia and Canada among others to follow suit.
 ""The U.S. government should ... prohibit any foreign
company's raising capital or listing its securities in the
United States while engaged in developing Eritrea's mineral
resources,"" USCIRF said in its report released this month.
 The government-funded commission was set up under the 1998
International Religious Freedom Act to give independent advice
to the White House and Congress and make policy suggestions.
 
 ""NOT POLITICAL""
 ""Religious freedom violations continue in Eritrea. These
violations include ... torture or other ill-treatment of
religious prisoners, sometimes resulting in death,"" USCIRF said.
 Rights groups claim more than 3,000 religious prisoners are
being detained without charge in Eritrea, some in underground
dungeons and old metal shipping containers in the desert.
 Eritrea rejects all accusations relating to religious
persecution, saying they are based on thin anecdotal evidence.
 The only religions officially registered in Eritrea are
Eritrean Orthodox, Roman Catholic, the Lutheran Evangelical
Church of Eritrea, and Islam. Groups say Eritreans of other
faiths, especially Jehovah's Witnesses and Baha'is, are
routinely mistreated and harassed.
 In response to the report, one Eritrea-based foreign miner
insisted the industry was a positive force in the country.
 ""We are not a political organisation, we are a business and
our presence is undeniably good for the average Eritrean,""
Timothy Strong, Eritrea manager for British mining company
London Africa, told Reuters by email.
 ""The industry creates jobs, helps Eritrea mine its own
resource and we contribute to local communities,"" Strong said.
 Nevsun's shares have previously taken a hit from
international action against Eritrea. United Nations sanctions
imposed last December on Eritrea for its alleged role in Somalia
saw the company's stock tumble 14 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Thursday to a
one-week low against the U.S. dollar and a record trough versus
the Swiss franc on concerns the harsh fiscal tightening in
Europe would lead to slower growth.
 Relief that countries such as Spain and Portugal are taking
more steps to cut their budget deficits was outweighed by
worries about the potential negative effect on growth, helping
to push the euro close to a 14-month low versus the dollar.
 A $1 trillion rescue deal reached at the weekend by global
policymakers eased immediate worries about the Greek sovereign
debt crisis spreading but left the underlying problems of high
deficits in some euro zone states unresolved.
 ""There are concerns that the austerity measures throughout
Europe are going to slow European growth. The euro is
vulnerable to that,"" said Michael Malpede, chief market analyst
at Easy Forex in Chicago.
 ""The European economy is going to underperform and growth
and yield differentials are moving in favor of the U.S.,"" he
added.
 In early New York trading, the euro fell 0.6 percent 
to $1.2550. It hit a session low of $1.2542 on electronic
trading platform EBS, its lowest for a week and near a
14-month low of $1.2510 set on EBS last week.
 Traders said euro losses accelerated once short-dated
option barriers at $1.2600 were breached in holiday-thinned
trade. More stops were cited under $1.2550.
 The dollar extended gains versus the euro after data showed
the number of U.S. workers filing new applications for
unemployment insurance fell last week, though by slightly less
than expected. See [ID:nN13233348]
 ""The job market is continuing to improve, though at a
glacial pace,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency
research at GFT in New York.
 ""Sentiment is still decidedly negative against the euro and
it would be interesting to see whether euro bears have the
ammunition to push the euro below a key $1.25 barrier.""
 The euro fell 0.9 percent versus the yen  to
116.53 yen and hit a record low versus the Swiss franc
 of 1.3997 francs, according to EBS.
 The Australian dollar rose 0.4 percent  to $0.8969,
buoyed by stronger-than-expected Australian employment data.

 Sterling fell 0.9 percent  to $1.4692, stung by UK

March. [ID:nONS006657]

 * Countries need help to develop local currency lending
(Adds background and quotes)
 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Emerging European economies
should cut down on foreign currency consumer loans, one of the
negative by-products of financial integration, the head of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on
Thursday.
 Emerging Europe suffered more than other emerging markets
during the global financial crisis, largely as a result of
foreign currency loans that turned sour as currencies plummeted.
 ""While financial integration has done more good than harm,
we cannot close our eyes to the harm it has done,"" EBRD
president Thomas Mirow said in the text of a speech for delivery
ahead of the bank's annual meeting in Zagreb, Croatia.
 ""Financial integration has encouraged some countries to take
unacceptable risks. This must be stopped... Short-term unsecured
consumer lending in foreign currency should be phased out.""
 The EBRD forecasts growth in the 29-country region of 3.3
percent this year following a 6.1 percent contraction last year.
It will issue revised forecasts at the meeting.
 The EBRD's board of governors is also expected at the
meeting to approve plans to increase the bank's capital by 50
percent to 30 billion euros, enabling higher levels of
investment. 
 Mirow said emerging European economies need to develop local
currency markets and local currency lending with help from
international lenders such as the EBRD.
 ""Even a relatively small country can mobilise term deposits
in local currency and create a basic government debt market in
local currency into which other agents -- chiefly banks -- can
issue if they wish."" 
 Mirow added that the recent euro zone debt crisis had
flagged up potential risks for euro zone aspirants.
 ""We all know that entering a monetary union without full
preparation may prove difficult down the road -- the current
troubles of the euro are partly a reflection of that fact.""
 The EBRD, set up after the Cold War to help former communist
countries in eastern Europe make the transition to market
economies, invests mainly in the private sector.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2010 09:24AM ET</span>",WRAPUP 1-US claims data point to elevated jobless rate," * Weekly jobless claims fall 4,000
 * Continuing claims unexpectedly rise
 * Import prices rise on energy, ex-petroleum gain modestly
 WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers
filing for jobless benefits fell only slightly last week,
highlighting the challenges facing the labor market, while
import prices pointed to tame inflation, according to
government data released on Thursday.
 Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped
4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 444,000, the Labor Department
said, though the number was still slightly above the 440,000
expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. The prior week's figure
was revised up to 448,000.
 In a second report, the department said import prices
increased 0.9 percent last month on higher petroleum costs
after rising 0.5 percent in March. However, excluding the
volatile petroleum category, import prices rose just modestly.
 Analysts said the slow decline in jobless claims against
the backdrop of a pickup in the pace of job growth was
puzzling, saying it pointed to a high unemployment rate.
 ""There are more jobs being created, but the general trend
is that businesses are still reluctant to hire. The data show
that the issue is more a lack of hiring and not people getting
laid off,"" said Gary Shilling, president at A. Gary Shilling &
Co in Springfield, New Jersey.
 ""That's why the unemployment rate remains where it is.""
 The jobless rate is currently at 9.9 percent.
 U.S. stock futures trimmed gains on the data, while
Treasury debt prices edged up slightly. The U.S. dollar
extended gains versus the euro.
 Though initial jobless claims are decreasing only slowly,
other measures of the labor market -- including the
government's closely watched employment report -- suggest job
growth is gaining traction as private sector employers become
more confident of the strength of the economic recovery.
 Payrolls grew at the fastest pace in four years in April,
according to government data last week that also showed the
fourth straight month of gains in employment. The economy has
grown for three straight quarters following the worst recession
since the 1930s.
 However, challenges remain in the job market. The number of
people still receiving jobless benefits after an initial week
of aid unexpectedly rose 12,000 to 4.63 million in the week
ended May 1, the Labor Department said.
 The level was well above market expectations for 4.58
million. The insured unemployment rate, which measures the
percentage of the insured labor force that is jobless, was
unchanged at 3.6 percent for a fourth straight week.
 With unemployment still at elevated levels and inflation
pressures remaining relatively benign, the Federal Reserve
should be able to keep its promise of ultra low interest rates
for an extended period.
 Import prices excluding petroleum rose 0.3 percent after
slipping 0.1 percent in March.
 Analysts generally expect U.S. dollar strength and excess
capacity in the global economy to keep a lid on prices of
imported merchandise, excluding petroleum.
 The Labor Department report also showed export prices rose
1.2 percent in April, building on the prior month's 0.7 percent
advance. Analysts had expected export prices to gain 0.4
percent. In the 12 months to April, export prices increased 5.7
percent, the largest gain since July 2008.

 * Euro zone debt rescue package spurs confidence
 * Risks to growth remain when government stimulus runs out
 
 (Adds poll graphics)
 By Ross Finley
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Optimism about a stronger
recovery among the world's richest nations is gradually rising,
Reuters polls show, unfazed by a European debt crisis that
started in Greece and gripped markets in a chokehold last week.
 While the United States, Japan, the euro zone and Britain
are still lagging growth in emerging market powerhouses like
India and China, they are on a solid path to recovery, according
to surveys of over 250 economists taken May 7-13.
 Economists say they are confident that a $1 trillion rescue
pledge led by the European Union and backed by the International
Monetary Fund that was announced on Monday has turned around
sentiment and has provided lasting calm to financial markets.
 They also say chances are slim that the emergency funds made
available to the 16 euro zone members will ever be used, despite
widespread concern about staggeringly high debt levels across
the developed world even with interest rates at record lows.
 ""The recovery (is) looking more and more like a 'V' with
each passing week,"" said Ellen Beeson Zentner, U.S. economist at
BTMU in New York, echoing a common view that the aggressive
stimulus measures put in place by governments and policymakers
in the depths of the recession are working.
 But the real test will be whether or not the recovery has a
life of its own.
 ""While the first half of 2010 looks to be surprising to the
upside, worries over the sustainability of strong growth --
(without) government stimulus -- in the second half of the year
are growing,"" said Zentner.
 Consensus forecasts for first quarter growth in Japan, where
usually subdued consumer spending surged, more than doubled.
 
 NO SIGN OF INFLATION YET
 But some argue that the Greece debt crisis, which has cut
the euro's value against the dollar to just above $1.25 from
about $1.45 at the start of the year, may delay when
policymakers are likely to raise interest rates.
 The Reuters poll is still showing a very close call for the
first tightening in U.S. monetary policy by the Federal Reserve,
tilting slightly toward end-September versus end-year.
 The Bank of England and the European Central Bank aren't
likely to raise until the first quarter of next year.
 Indeed, what is most striking from the latest set of monthly
Reuters polls is how little concern economists are showing over
the prospect of consumer price inflation given how strong the
recovery is shaping up.
 Price rises are a much bigger concern in emerging market
nations like India -- where inflation is running close to 10
percent and food inflation at more than 16 percent. Interest
rates are already rising there.
 But in the United States, inflation will hold around 2
percent this year according to the poll.
 ""The deep recession has left the economy with substantial
slack,"" said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International. ""We expect core inflation to fall below 1
percent, justifying a long period of unchanged monetary policy.""
 Even in Britain, where consumer price rises have been larger
than in its major trading partners, inflation is still set to
average well below 2 percent next year. And Japan's latest bout
of deflation looks set to persist as well.

 * Short-term risk of Greek debt restructuring down to 10 pct
 * 20 percent chance of Greece/Portugal accessing safety net
 * Euro zone economy seen sluggish for foreseeable future
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - The $1 trillion financial safety
net announced for the euro zone this week will give financial
markets ""lasting confidence"" and there is only a slim chance
that individual countries will need to use the net, a Reuters
poll of over 60 economists showed.
 Median forecasts from 26 economists pointed to a diminishing
chance of Greece leaving the euro zone in the next five years.
They also suggested the euro zone's economic recovery would stay
sluggish over the next 18 months.
 The poll was conducted after Monday's announcement of a 750
billion euro ($1 trillion) emergency aid facility led by the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund, designed to
douse market speculation about the vulnerability of the most
debt-ridden countries in the euro zone.
 Twenty-five out of 27 economists who answered a question on
the subject said they expected the package to succeed.
 ""The actions announced over the weekend tick all the boxes
and make an explicit statement to markets that European
governments are prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to
defend the single currency union,"" said Azad Zangana of
Schroders Investment in London.
 Respondents assigned Greece and Portugal, seen by markets as
the most vulnerable countries, only a one-in-five chance of
accessing the emergency funds in the next year, and a one-in-ten
chance for Spain and Ireland. Greece is already receiving a
separate international bailout, announced early this month,
worth 110 billion euros.
 
 GREECE
 Economists cut their estimate of the probability of Greece's
economic crisis forcing it out of the euro zone in the next five
years to 5 percent. That was down from 9 percent in a Reuters
poll on April 28.
 Greece's economy shrank 0.8 percent in the first quarter,
figures showed on Wednesday. While that was nowhere near as bad
as some had feared, analysts expect worse ahead as harsh
austerity measures take effect.
 But economists surveyed in Thursday's poll said Athens
probably now had all the help it needed to survive the crisis.
 ""Some of the measures that will be put in place in Greece,
the country that faces the most adverse debt dynamics, will also
address some questions regarding international competitiveness,""
said Paula Carvalho at Banco BPI in Lisbon.
 Economists also think the risk of Greece needing to
restructure its 300 billion euro debt has fallen. Respondents in
the latest Reuters poll gave a 10 percent chance of a
restructuring in the next 12 months, down from 20 percent in the
April 28 poll.
 For Portugal, Spain and Ireland, they assigned a 5 percent
chance of a sovereign debt restructuring in the next 12 months
to each country.
 
 SLUGGISH GROWTH
 Partly because of austerity measures in some economies,
median forecasts from around 40 economists predicted quarterly
gross domestic product growth in the euro zone would not exceed
0.5 percent in any quarter through to the end of next year.
 Forecasters expect the region's economy to grow 1.0 percent
this year and 1.5 percent next year, unchanged from April's
long-term Reuters poll on G7 economies.
 ""The euro area is clearly lagging behind other advanced
economies and growth remains strongly dependent on temporary
factors such as the inventory cycle and stimulus packages,"" said
Kerstin Bernoth at German economic research institute DIW.
 With pre-crisis levels of growth still looking distant and
uncertainty surrounding sovereign debt, forecasters held onto
their view that the European Central Bank would wait until the
first quarter of next year to start hiking interest rates.
 Median forecasts showed the ECB raising rates by 25 basis
points in each quarter next year.

 * Most of debt is in bonds issued in foreign currency
 
 By Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, May 13 (Reuters) - Hungary's local governments
have total debts of around 1.08 trillion forints ($4.98 billion)
which threatens hundreds of them with insolvency, Price
Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) said on Thursday.
 Of the total debt stock, 450 billion forints are bank loans,
and the rest are bonds, PWC told a news conference.
 Compounding the problems, almost 90 percent of all debt is
denominated in foreign currencies, mostly Swiss francs and
euros, that have gained substantially against the forint since
the loans and bonds were issued, PWC director Gyula Bunna said.
 PWC conducted an independent study because it fears that
municipal debt obligations might present a big fiscal challenge
to the incoming centre-right Fidesz party government.
 Out of Hungary's 3,200 municipalities, almost 300 have
issued bonds, Bunna said. Their debt stock varies from 30 to 70
percent of their annual spending.
 ""Because the municipal bonds typically had a a 3-5 year
grace period, the payments begin to kick in this year, while the
income was already booked years ago,"" Bunna said. 
 The grace period ends on about 10 percent of all bonds this
year, and another 30 percent in 2011.
 ""The financing gap will widen, and we cannot see how (local
governments) will finance themselves.""
 ""The trouble is, the typical borrowers are the bigger towns,
which influence the economies of entire regions,"" Bunna added.
""Lots of jobs depend on them.""
 The outgoing Socialist government reduced the budget deficit
from nearly 10 percent of GDP in 2006 to 4 percent last year, by
cutting spending including state funding to municipalities.
 At the same time, municipal borrowing and debt issuance was
made easier through lax rules on collateral, PWC said.
 
 BANKS EXPOSED
 The local government lending market is highly concentrated,
with OTP Bank, Austria's Erste Bank and Raiffeisen Bank, and CIB
Bank, the local unit of Italy's Intesa SanPaolo, holding most of
the debt.
 ""More than 90 percent of the bond stock remains on the books
of the banks that bought them,"" Bunna said. ""There is no
secondary market to speak of.""
 That means potential defaults would hurt banks and may pose
a systemic risk to the banking sector, he said.
""Local governments' (asset) holdings are structured in a very
obscure way,"" he said. ""They have little market value, and
unclear ownership structures. Anyhow, it's doubtful how (banks)
can exercise their collateral rights on a hospital.""
 The solution will likely require some kind of government
involvement to consolidate and manage the debt, Bunna said.
 ""Right now, municipalities and banks are staring down at one
another, wondering who wins in their game of chicken.""

 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks rose nearly 1
percent on Thursday, eyeing their largest weekly gain in 10
months on renewed risk-taking following the EU's stabilisation
package, but debt worries in Dubai moved back into focus.
The EU's $1 trillion package has reassured markets, which
were thinner than usual on Thursday due to a holiday in some
European countries.
 Markets were briefly jittery on worries over whether euro
zone countries can enforce austerity measures and ahead of the
repayment of a $980 million sukuk for troubled Dubai World
subsidiary Nakheel, a reminder of the sovereign debt crisis
which rocked markets last year.
 A government spokesman confirmed Nakheel funds were with the
paying agent and sources said bondholders had received payment.

 ""The Nakheel repayment was good news but now focus is
shifting to Dubai Holding which last week appointed advisers for
restructuring,"" said Okan Akin, emerging corporate debt
strategist at RBS.
 Dubai International Capital, the overseas arm of Dubai
Holding, reiterated on Thursday it would refinance its upcoming
June syndicated loan.
 Benchmark emerging equities briefly hit their highest in
over a week, eradicating last week's sharp losses and posting
gains of nearly 6 percent from 2-1/2 month lows set on Friday.
Emerging stocks are on course for the largest weekly gain since
July 2009.
 The zloty hit nine-day highs against the euro before
retreating, but was up over 7 percent from lows set on Friday.
 The Turkish lira has also recovered by more than 5 percent
against the dollar from Friday's lows and was up 0.4 percent
from the U.S. close. 
 The South African rand fell a quarter percent ahead of a
1300 GMT rate decision, expected to show no change in rates of
6.5 percent. 
 Emerging sovereign debt spreads tightened by 3 basis points
to 277 bps over U.S. Treasuries, and have wiped out all of the
rapid widening in spreads which took hold at the end of last
week.
 Kazakh state uranium company Kazatomprom set yield guidance
on a $500 million five-year bond in the 6.75 percent area, with
pricing due later on Thursday, and Russian mid-sized oil firm
Tatneft is starting a roadshow this week.
 Tighter yield spreads may encourage borrowers such as
Albania and Argentina to issue planned Eurobonds, which have
been delayed by the euro zone debt crisis.
 While countries such as Poland and Iceland are showing less
enthusiasm for joining the euro, Estonia won European Commission
backing on Wednesday to join the single currency next year.
 Estonia's kroon currency is pegged to the euro.
 ""Given what happened with southern Europe (the authorities)
are keen to show the euro zone is still expanding and they would
like to use this as an example that if you get on the right
track you will get in,"" said Peter Attard Montalto, emerging
markets strategist at Nomura.

union ruled out on Thursday a general strike before meeting the
prime minister to discuss public wage cuts as part of a package
to cut its deficit back to EU guidelines and appease markets.
 Unions mooted demonstrations on Tuesday after Prime Minister

 * VAT tax to be raised to 21 pct from 20 pct
 * Salary cuts for public firms' managers, politicians

 (Adds quote, details, background)
 LISBON, May 13 (Reuters) - Portugal's prime minister and the
leader of the main opposition party on Thursday agreed on
additional austerity measures to cut the 2010 budget deficit by
around 2 billion euros to avoid a Greek-style debt crisis, a
source close to the negotiations said.
 The package is expected to be approved at a cabinet meeting
on Thursday after talks between Prime Minister Jose Socrates and
PSD party leader Pedro Passos Coelho and half the savings would
come from tax hikes.
 Socrates' Socialists need the support of the opposition to
pass bills in parliament.
 The maximum value-added tax rate would rise to 21 percent
from 20 percent, an additional tax on large companies' and
banks' profits would be imposed, while income taxes would also
have a yet unspecified increase, the source added.
 ""There is already an understanding on the new measures, for
an amount of around 2 billion euros. Around half will come from
the spending cuts and the other half from the revenue increase,""
the source said.
 On the spending side, a cut in top level public sector wages
like state-run company managers and politicians is proposed.
 The minority Socialist government said at the weekend it
would cut the budget deficit to around 7 percent of gross
domestic product this year compared to 8.3 percent as outlined
in its Brussels-approved medium-term budget consolidation
strategy, but did not then specify how.
 The medium-term strategy aims to slash the budget deficit to
2.8 percent in 2013 from last year's highs of 9.4 percent. 
 The cross-party understanding comes a day after Spain
announced additional cuts in public spending and civil service
wages designed to reduce its budget deficit, and three days
after the creation of a trillion-dollar euro zone safety net.
 Debt-stricken Greece has had to implement severe additional
austerity measures after resorting to a 110 billion euro bailout
package from the European Union and the International Monetary
Fund earlier in May.

(Adds comments) 
 TOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - Kokusai Asset Management's Global
Sovereign fund, the world's second-biggest bond fund, cut its
exposure to the euro by 4.8 percentage points since the end of
March to 29.6 percent on May 10 as the euro zone's debt crisis
intensified.
The fund also cut its exposure to the British pound and the
yen, its managers said, but its weightings rose in bonds
denominated in U.S. and Candian dollars.
 ""We are flexible about changing our investment strategy to
cope with changes in the investment environment,"" an official at
Kokusai Asset said.
 Global Sovereign invests in government bonds with high
credit ratings and is second in size to PIMCO Total Return Fund
of the United States, with assets under management totalling 3.8
trillion yen ($40.76 billion). 
 The fund's exposure to the British pound dropped to 2.8
percent as of May 6 from 4.3 percent at the end of March and its
allocation to yen-denominated bonds fell to 7.4 percent from 7.7
percent, said an official of Kokusai Asset.
 By contrast, its weightings in the U.S. dollar rose to 27.9
percent from 25.6 percent, and its exposure to the Canadian
dollar inched up to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent.
 The fund also raised its allocation to bonds denominated in
the Australian dollar, and the Norwegian and Swedish crowns.
 The official said currencies of emerging markets and the
Australian, U.S. and Canadian dollars could rise as the U.S.
economy picks up more convincingly.
 The euro slid to an eight-year low of 110.49 yen last week
on trading platform EBS as fears of contagion stemming from the
Greek debt crisis escalated.
 The euro has since rebounded after global policymakers put
together an emergency $1 trillion package to resolve the euro
zone's debt crisis, and it stood near 117 yen on Thursday.
 But market players say the euro still looks vulnerable due
to concerns over whether debt-strapped countries such as Greece
can smoothly bring down their fiscal deficits, and on worries
that fiscal austerity measures in the euro zone could weigh on
economic growth.
 The Global Sovereign fund has been a symbol of Japanese
households' appetite for higher-yielding foreign assets over the
past few years. But its popularity has been hit since late 2008
as the yen surged after the financial crisis.

 BUDAPEST, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro zone is in turmoil and
Hungary's incoming government will focus economic policy this
year and next on promoting growth rather than on joining the
single currency, economy minister designate Gyorgy Matolcsy said
on Thursday.
 Prior to last weekend's $1 trillion rescue deal, ""the euro
zone reached the brink of collapse,"" Matolcsy, who takes over
the post later this month, told news portal fn.hu.
 Amid signs of waning enthusiasm for the single currency in
several euro candidate countries, he said the new government
""will pursue an economic policy whose main peg is not the euro
as the rules of the game have changed ...
 ""The first thing here is that we should have growth again.""
 Matolcsy said global policymakers had been wise to hammer
out a rescue deal for the euro zone when they did, because
""there is terribly big trouble (there)"".
 He said further crises, both large and small, were likely to
affect the single currency area in the next 18-24 months.
 Estonia remains on track to adopt the euro next year after
winning European Commission backing for its bid on Wednesday.
 But Poland's finance minister said Warsaw was in no rush to
join the bloc, which needed time to ""refurbish"" after the Greek
woes, and his Icelandic counterpart told Reuters on Wednesday
that domestic opposition to EU membership was growing.

parliamentary majority in April's elections, said a week ago the

 He told fn.hu on Thursday the country should go its own way
this year and next to create a credible and stable economy by
focusing on reviving growth.
 Fidesz has promised deep tax cuts to create jobs and help
economic growth, and said it would seek agreement with
international lenders including the IMF and the EU to run a
higher 2010 budget deficit than the outgoing Socialist
government had targeted.
 Matolcsy reiterated in the interview that the new government
wanted to cut the bloated public sector in the next four years,
but said firing a large number of state employees in its first
year would make no sense.
 ""Sacking people in the crisis would be a very stupid thing;
in that moment consumption and the revenue of the (state) budget
would fall,"" he said.
 He said the government did not have an exchange rate target,
but the economy needed a stable forint . The currency
traded around 273 against the euro on Thursday.
 ""Movements of a few percent in the exchange rate can be
allowed, but 15-20-30 forint jumps not,"" he said.

 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a one-week low
on Thursday, as looming fiscal tightening requirements in the
euro zone outweighed the benefits of an aid package aimed at
shoring up euro zone bond markets.
 A $1 trillion rescue deal hammered out at the weekend by
global policymakers had eased investor worries a Greek sovereign
debt crisis will spread.
 However, concerns about the ability of fiscally weaker
states to make necessary budget cuts and about the impact on
growth continue to weigh on the euro.
 ""Fiscal tightening in the euro zone is going to be
broad-based and this is negative for the euro,"" said Ian
Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas. 
 Passage of the rescue deal has boosted risk appetite this
week, providing a temporary floor to the single currency.
 But by 0925 GMT, the euro had given back earlier gains to
trade down 0.3 percent versus the dollar at $1.2580, bringing
last week's 14-month low of $1.2520 back into focus. 
 Traders said short-dated option-interest at $1.2600 had been
targeted in holiday-thinned trade with stops triggered
underneath. More stops were said to be lurking under $1.2550.
 ""There are question marks over the austerity measures
required in the southern European states and that makes the euro
vulnerable,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency analyst at Rabobank.
 The euro fell 0.5 percent versus the yen to 117.00 yen as
European stocks turned negative. Euro/yen fell to an eight-year
low of 110.49 yen on trading platform EBS last week as global
stocks tumbled on risk aversion related to the euro zone debt
crisis.
 The single currency hit a record low versus the Swiss franc
of 1.3997, according to EBS.
 The dollar was up around 0.1 percent against the yen at
93.28 yen. Versus a basket of currencies, the greenback was up
0.3 percent at 85.038. The index hit a 1-year high of 85.268

 The Australian dollar trimmed gains to trade up 0.5 percent
at $0.8980 versus the U.S. dollar. Australian employment data
came in stronger than expected earlier, pushing the currency

 Analysts said interest rate rises from the Reserve Bank of
Australia may be limited by external factors, potentially
capping further Aussie gains.

outlook and a tightening in the labour market, we think global
factors dominate and expect the RBA to stay on the sidelines for

 By Christina Fincher and David Milliken
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Britain's goods trade deficit
with the rest of the world widened more than expected in March
after imports grew more than five times faster than exports,
official data showed on Thursday.
 The Office for National Statistics said the data's
volatility had been heightened by weather-related distortions at
the start of the year, which shifted some exports into February,
when the trade gap narrowed to a 3-1/2-year low.
 The global goods trade gap widened to 7.522 billion pounds
($11.19 billion) in March from February's 6.305 billion pounds,
after exports edged up by 1.0 percent but imports surged 5.2
percent, their fastest rate since September 2009.
 The figures are unlikely to please Bank of England Governor
Mervyn King, who said on Wednesday that Britain's economy needed
to refocus on exports and move away from growth based on
domestic consumption.
 Sterling fell to the day's low against the dollar  as
investors questioned how big a boost past falls in the currency
were giving to exporters.
 ""These are disappointing numbers,"" said Ross Walker, UK
economist at RBS. ""I'm sceptical we're going to see any
significant contribution to growth this year from net trade. The
much-needed rebalancing is not happening as quickly as we would
have hoped, especially given the weakness in sterling.""
 The pound has shed almost a fifth of its value since the
middle of 2007 against the currencies of its main trading
partners <=GBP>.
 The rise in imports was broad-based and driven by a jump in
imports of intermediate goods such as mechanical and electrical
engineering components as well as cars, chemicals and oil.
 Exports of chemicals -- previously a strong performer --
fell sharply on the month.
 ""Recent events in the euro-zone -- the UK's biggest trading
partner -- clearly cast a shadow over the longer-term prospects
for UK exporters,"" said Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital
Economics. ""Overall, it still seems unwise to rely on the
external sector to keep the economic recovery going once the
fiscal squeeze hits.""
 Britain's goods trade gap with countries outside the
European Union also widened more than expected in March to 4.103
billion pounds from 3.406 billion in February.
 The total trade gap -- which includes the harder-to-quantify
trade in services -- widened to 3.863 billion pounds from 2.187
billion pounds.
 Britain's surplus in services fell to its lowest since July
2009 at 3.839 billion pounds in March, down from 4.118 billion.
 Economists had forecast a global goods trade deficit of 6.41
billion pounds and a goods trade gap with non-EU countries of
3.35 billion pounds.

 * Euro weakens on concerns over impact of fiscal austerity
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - A stock rally spurred by last
weekend's EU rescue plan continued on Thursday with world shares
rising to one-week highs and emerging equities up almost one
percent.
 The euro, however, pared some gains, trading just off recent
lows against the dollar against a backdrop of expectations for
weak euro zone growth.
 The Ascension Day holiday in continental Europe stripped
some volume, but major markets were open.
 World stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> have risen close to 6 percent
this week following the weekend's 750 billion euro agreement by
the European Union and International Monetary Fund to stave off
a sovereign debt crisis.
 They were up around 0.3 percent on Thursday while emerging
markets <.MSCIEF> gained 0.8 percent. 
 The rescue plan has not solved Europe's debt problems but it
has put a floor under investors' worst fears of a new financial
meltdown and allowed for some pick-up in risk appetite, with
credit spreads tightening.
 Investors have also been able to focus more on fundamentals
such as the state of the economy and corporate earnings rather
than reacting to fears about Greece and other EU peripheral
economies.
 ""Economics has come back to the forefront as a calmer market
sentiment has been restored,"" Brown Brothers Harriman said in a
note.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up half a
percent, having risen more than 8 percent this week, essentially
regaining last week's losses.
 U.S. stocks were also poised to open firmer with S&P 500 and
Nasdaq futures   up 2.25 to 2.5 points. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures  were marginally weaker.
 Traders were focusing on a recent spate of soothing company
earnings, some of which were initially all but ignored in the
fears about a spreading sovereign debt crisis.
 ""The results that we have been seeing from companies have
been very positive and are providing a driving force to equity
markets,"" said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Wealth.
 ""They (results) exceeded market expectations over the course
of the past three months and analysts have been predicting a far
more confident outlook for the rest of this year.""
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 2.18 percent.
 
 IT'S THE ECONOMY
 There was no bullishness when it came to the euro, which has
been battered by the sovereign debt crisis and concerns for the
stability of the currency bloc itself.
 The single currency fell to a one-week low, weighed down by
worries over how looming fiscal tightening requirements in the
euro zone will impact growth and second, whether the weak
members in the bloc will be able to make necessary budget cuts.
 Against the dollar, the euro traded down to $1.2580, down
0.2 percent , not far from last week's 14-month low. It
fell 0.5 percent against the yen  and touched a record
low against the Swiss franc .
 Investors are fretting that the euro zone's tentative
recovery -- quarterly growth was 0.2 percent in January-March
-- will be hurt by the need for countries to cut spending to
reduce their bloated deficits.
 ""Fiscal tightening in the euro zone is going to be
broad-based and this is negative for the euro,"" said Ian
Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 Portuguese leaders agreed tough new austerity measures on
Thursday [ID:nLDE64B0SK] following on the heels of Spain, which
on Wednesday said it would slash civil service pay by 5 percent
this year, freeze it in 2011, cut investment spending and
pensions and axe 13,000 public sector jobs in a drive to meet EU
deficit targets.
 Bund futures eased as demand for safe havens was tempered.
 Gold, however, was in demand at near record prices around
$1,250 an ounce as traders considered the inflationary impact of
the rescue plan.

 * Euro zone peripheral debt yields steady
 * Central bank debt purchases seen subdued in early trading
 
 By William James
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Bund futures fell on Thursday as
budget-cutting measures by indebted euro zone states boosted
risk appetite and hurt safe haven demand for Bunds.
 Portugal was set to discuss new steps to tackle the
country's budget deficit, following in the footsteps of Spain
which cheered investors on Wednesday by announcing tough new
austerity measures.
Signs that states were taking firm action to address
medium-term fiscal imbalances, following a bumper rescue package
to secure the euro zone's immediate stability, led investors to
scale back demand for the security of German debt. 
 ""It's a classic unwinding of risk aversion. With Bunds
previously being the eye of the storm and benefiting, clearly
they're now going to be the ones under the most pressure,"" said
Andre de Silva, strategist at HSBC. 
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on
Wednesday backed sanctions for countries not meeting budget
deficit requirements, but ruled out the step of excluding budget
sinners from the euro zone.
 While central bank buying of government bonds -- an
unprecedented step agreed as part of the rescue package -- was
seen to be subdued early in the session, peripheral euro zone
debt yields remained steady, although liquidity was thin.
 Portuguese and Spanish 10-year bond yield spreads against
Bunds narrowed slightly from Wednesday's levels.
 
 RISK APPETITE IMPROVES
 The risk-positive outlook weighing on Bunds was supported by
signs of growth in euro zone GDP data released on Wednesday and
renewed attention on a relatively positive global economic
outlook that had been overshadowed by the sovereign debt crisis.
 ""I don't think that the markets run away from here, it's
likely to be a bit of a volatile run, but overall our preference
would be to sell into strength in the core markets at least,""
said Sean Maloney, rate strategist at Nomura.
 At 0800 GMT, the Bund future was 12 ticks lower at 125.55.
The 10-year German bond yield was 2.961 percent, up 1 basis
points while the two-year Schatz yield was down 1.5 basis points
at 0.576 percent.
 In supply, Italy will auction up to 5 billion euros of 2015
and 2025 BTP bonds with expectations for a largely smooth sale.
 ""We've seen demand for the five-year part of the curve so
that shouldn't be a problem, the slight question mark for me is
that anything longer than 10 years doesn't seem to be in the
buying zone,"" said a trader in London.
 No major euro zone economic data is due for release on
Thursday, and some European markets are closed for a public
holiday.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Thursday,
aided by an improvement in risk appetite which boosted
higher-yielding currencies and as contagion risks from euro zone
debt problems diminished.
 A $1 trillion rescue deal hammered out at the weekend by
global policymakers has eased investor worries a Greek sovereign
debt crisis will spread.
 However, concerns about the ability of fiscally weaker
states to make necessary budget cuts and about the impact on
growth continue to weigh on the euro.
 Passage of the rescue deal has boosted risk appetite this
week and data on Thursday showing Australian unemployment surged
in April added to this. [ID: nSGE64C03O]
 Asian equity markets rose, with the Nikkei <.N225> holding
gains of around 2 percent, following on from robust performances
in U.S. stocks on Wednesday.<.SPX>
 ""For now the contagion risks in the euro zone have been
partly stemmed which has helped the riskier currencies and
provided a floor for the euro,"" said Jeremy Stretch, currency
analyst at Rabobank.
 ""But there are question marks over the austerity measures
required in the southern European states and that makes the euro
vulnerable,"" he said.
 At 0728 GMT, the euro was trading with gains of around 0.3
percent on the day versus the dollar  at $1.2675, but
remained in sight of its recent 14-month low near $1.25. Traders
reported strong option-related demand around $1.25.
 The euro rallied 0.7 percent versus the yen  to
118.60 yen, having fallen to an eight-year low of 110.49 yen on
trading platform EBS last week.
 In the week to May 8, Japanese investors dumped a net 1.57
trillion ($16.8 billion) yen of overseas bonds, the heaviest net
selling since 2.11 trillion from the week to April 4 last year,
data from Japan's finance ministry showed. [JP/CAP]
 Traders said this illustrated the growing risk aversion
which fuelled a rout in global stocks last week.
 The dollar was up around 0.4 percent against the yen 
at 93.55 yen.
 The Australian dollar rallied close to 1 percent on the day
to trade back above $0.90 versus the U.S. dollar .
 But analysts said interest rate rises from the Reserve Bank
of Australia may be limited by external factors, potentially
capping further Aussie gains.
 ""Despite the RBA's increasing concerns over the inflation
outlook and a tightening in the labour market, we think global
factors dominate and expect the RBA to stay on the sidelines for
the next couple of months,"" said Su-Lin Ong, senior economist at
RBC Capital.
 Sterling climbed 0.6 percent versus the dollar  to
$1.4912, trimming losses made the previous day when a dovish
inflation outlook from the Bank of England knocked the currency
down around 0.7 percent.

 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the
dollar on Thursday but remained vulnerable near a recent 14-month
low on concerns about the risk of a sovereign debt crisis in the
euro zone and the impact of fiscal measures on the region's
growth.
 Gains in the euro are likely to be limited as investors are
expected to use any rallies as an opportunity to sell it, traders
said, and it hovered near a recent record low against the Swiss
franc set at 1.4005 francs.
 The Australian dollar nudged higher after data showed the
domestic economy added 33,700 jobs in April, handily beating
forecasts for a 20,000 rise.
 ""Financial markets overall have been returning to calm but
the euro remains on a downtrend,"" said Kosuke Hanao, head of
treasury product sales at HSBC in Japan.
 ""Although the panic sell-off in the euro has eased at the
moment, the downside risk still remains.""
 The euro edged up 0.4 percent from late U.S. trade on
Wednesday to $1.2658 but remained within sight of its 14-month
low near $1.25 hit last week. Near-term psychological support for
the euro is seen at that level but some in the market see the
currency falling below $1.2400 as it did in 2008.
 Traders cited market talk of decent bids in the euro at
$1.2610/20 and also ahead of an option barrier at $1.2600.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.3 percent to 117.97 yen,
having fallen to a eight-year low of 110.49 yen on trading
platform EBS last week.
 In the week to May 8, Japanese investors dumped a net 1.57
trillion ($16.8 billion) of overseas bonds, the heaviest net
selling since 2.11 trillion from the week to April 4 last year,
data from Japan's finance ministry showed.
 The figure came despite the fact that there were only two
trading days last week due to Japan's ""Golden week"" holidays and
the move may have contributed to the yen's sharp appreciation
last week, although it may not have been the main driver.
 A market source said the massive selling of foreign bonds by
Japanese investors last week was led by the banking sector, which
trimmed positions in medium-term to long-term foreign bonds.
 Since Japanese investors were net buyers of foreign stocks
last week, the selling of foreign bonds may not be a simple case
of fund repatriation, the source added.
 Japanese banks often invest in foreign bonds in a manner that
does not involve taking on foreign exchange risk, and any
unwinding of such positions would not have a direct impact on
currency moves.
 Although the euro drew support from Spain's spending cuts and
a successful bond sale in Portugal on Wednesday, worries about
euro zone economic growth continued to weigh on the currency.
 ""The next question will be how debt-stricken nations in the
euro zone can manage to cut their fiscal deficits,"" said Jun
Kato, senior manager of investment at Shinkin Asset Management.
 ""People are still looking at Europe now but fundamentals
generally are expected to return as a trading factor, given
relatively good economic numbers in the U.S. and steady stock
markets.""
 Firm stocks and the Aussie's moderate rise after the data
helped investor sentiment slightly, traders said.
 The Australian dollar advanced 0.6 percent to $0.9000. It
also rose 0.6 percent to 83.83 yen.
 Sterling climbed 0.2 percent to $1.4855, trimming some of
its losses from the previous day, when it fell 0.7 percent, hurt
by the Bank of England's dovish outlook for UK growth and
inflation in its quarterly inflation report.
 The euro was little changed near 85.24 pence.
 The dollar edged down 0.1 percent to 93.18 yen. A trader for
a Japanese bank cited Japanese exporters offers at levels above
93.00 yen.

 * But RBA in wait and watch mode, given European worries
 * RBA's Lowe highlights risks to Asian growth
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, May 13 (Reuters) - Australia's employment soared in
April, beating expectations as firms ramped up full-time hiring
in a sign of growing confidence in the economy, but rates look
set to remain on hold given the turmoil in financial markets.
 Thursday's data showed unemployment stayed low at 5.4
percent, with a healthy 33,700 jobs being added in April. That
followed a similar rise in March, marking the eighth straight
month of gains.
 Earlier in the day, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)
Assistant Governor Philip Lowe said confidence in Europe's
finances has stabilised but concerns about sovereign debt could
build again, posing a risks to Asian growth.
 Any slowdown in Asian growth would hit Australia hard as
the region is its biggest export market and concerns about a
possible fall-out from Greece's debt crisis are expected to
persuade the central bank to look past the robust jobs data.
 ""Despite the RBA's increasing concerns over the inflation
outlook and a tightening in the labour market, we think global
factors dominate and expect the RBA to stay on the sidelines
for the next couple of months,"" said Su-Lin Ong, senior
economist at RBC Capital.
 The Australian dollar edged up after the stellar jobs
numbers, but bill futures were broadly lower with the report
doing little to alter expectations that the central bank will
keep rates on hold when it meets again on June 1.
 The central bank raised its cash rate by 25 basis points to
4.5 percent last week but signalled it would take a pause in
its tightening cycle. It has hiked by 150 basis points since
October and markets see rates on hold at least until August.
 The RBA has been one of the most aggressive central banks
in withdrawing the monetary stimulus in the past few months.
Part of the reason for the tightening is an expected huge boost
to Australian incomes and investment from higher iron ore and
coal prices. In addition, the housing sector is showing signs
of overheating while the jobs market has been recovering much
faster than anyone had expected a year ago.
 The latest employment rise takes total employment gains to
date in 2010 to a whopping 110,000 with the economy adding
28,000 jobs on average each month this year. Last month's rise
in full time jobs that offer better security and higher pay --
an addition of 37,500 positions -- was even more impressive. 
OUTLOOK BRIGHT, INFLATION A KEY CONCERN
 The jobs market has shown remarkable growth, with nearly
250,000 jobs being added since August last year and job ads and
vacancies point to more strength ahead.
 ""With leading indicators such as the employment component
of the NAB business survey recently creeping higher, it appears
that solid employment gains are set to continue,"" said Helen
Kevans, economist at JPMorgan.
 But the strong labour market poses a challenge to the
central bank by driving up wages and adding to inflation
pressures.
 Lowe addressed those concerns in a speech to an investment
forum, saying that despite market turmoil caused by fears the
Greek crisis could spread the central scenario for Australia
was positive, mainly due to the terms of trade boom.
 Huge price increases for iron ore and coal, Australia's two
biggest exports, are expected to shower money on the economy
through higher profits, investment, wages and tax receipts.
 Last week, the central bank estimated the terms of trade --
the ratio of export prices to import prices -- would rise
around 20 percent this year, lifting incomes by around 4
percent.
 Lowe said boosting supply to keep up with increased demand
and avoid a rise in inflation would be a major challenge for
the Australian economy.
 ""Over the past couple of decades, low and stable inflation
has clearly been one of the critical elements in Australia's
good economic performance. We need to make sure this
continues,"" said Lowe.

 HONG KONG, May 13 (Reuters) - Asian stocks hit highs for
the week on Thursday after new austerity steps pledged by
Portugal and Spain raised hopes that Europe's debt crisis can
be contained, while IBM's strong profit forecast boosted tech
shares.
 The optimism was seen carrying into the opening of European
markets with futures for the STOXX Europe 50, Germany's DAX and
France's CAC 40 up 0.7 to 0.8 percent.
 Despite edging higher against the dollar, the euro
struggled near 14-month lows on worries the steep government
spending cuts in parts of Europe would drag on the region's
already feeble economic growth.
 Doubts about the euro's long-term viability and worries
about inflation continued to spur a flight into gold, which
shot to a fresh record for a second day in a row.
 The jump to $1,248.15 an ounce brought gold's gains to
nearly 20 percent since early February.
 Spain said on Wednesday it will slash civil service pay and
cut public jobs while Portugal's finance minister told Reuters
his government had identified new austerity measures to reduce
its budget deficit, offering investors some reassurances that
those countries are addressing deep-rooted fiscal problems.
 ""The euro zone problems had really weighed on the market,
and reassurance after the Spanish announcement has allowed
investors to turn their eyes to things like earnings and
economic indicators for the first time in days,"" said Toshiyuki
Kanayama, a market analyst at Monex Inc in Tokyo.
 Japan's Nikkei gained 2.2 percent to a one week closing
high as buyers snapped up tech stocks like Advantest, which
makes micro chip testing equipment, and shares of other
companies which have recently released upbeat earnings and
sales outlooks. Advantest jumped 3.3 percent.
 While worries remain that Greece and other governments will
not be able to deliver on deeply unpopular spending cuts, there
were signs that recent strains in global money markets were
easing, further buoying investor confidence.
 CREDIT MARKET REVIVAL
 The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate
(LIBOR) was unchanged after rising steadily during the height
of the worries about Europe's sovereign debt problems.
 Debt capital markets also showed signs of revival in the
region with Macau casino operator Melco Crown Entertainment
selling a $600 milllion bond overnight following last week's
jitters over European debt which had issuers postponing their
offerings.
 By 0645 GMT, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 2 percent
higher after hitting its highest this week with technology, the
best performing sector, outpacing the broad market with a 2.9
percent rise.
 Tech bellwether has forecast it would roughly double its
profit by 2015, fuelling bullishness on the sector.
 Tech-heavy stock markets in South Korea and Taiwan rose
over 2 percent. Both had seen several days of selling by
foreign investors earlier in the week, but data showed overseas
buyers were returning to Korean shares on Thursday.
 In Taiwan, chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co
(TSMC) and UMC boosted the main TAIEX share index by as much as
2.4 percent.
 ""U.S. data and earnings have helped, meaning stocks are

 By Sinead Carew and Gabriel Madway
 NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, May 12 (Reuters) - HTC Corp fired
back on Monday in its legal battle with Apple Inc, asking the
U.S. International Trade Commission to ban sales of iPhones,
iPads and iPods in the United States.
 In a complaint filed with the ITC and obtained by Reuters,
HTC accused Apple of infringing five of its patents related to
cellphone directory hardware and software and power-management
technology in portable devices.
 HTC's action was widely expected after Apple filed a patent
infringement suit against the company in March.
 Apple's move against HTC was seen as a proxy for an attack
on Google Inc. Taiwan's HTC makes smartphones based on Google's
Android software, which has gained ground on Apple's popular
iPhone.
 In the complaint dated May 12, HTC said Apple violated
patents on technology that helps devices such as the iPhone
manage power and handle phone directories, and on technology
that enables the just-launched iPad tablet computer to store
data when in ""sleep"" mode, among other applications.
 HTC is seeking a ban on importation, marketing and sale of
Apple's popular mobile devices in the United States. Apple,
whose products are made in countries such as China, declined
comment.
 For its part, Apple accused HTC of infringing 20 patents.
In addition, Apple filed a complaint with the ITC and also sued
HTC in the U.S. District Court in Delaware.
 ""We are taking this action against Apple to protect our
intellectual property, our industry partners, and most
importantly, our customers that use HTC phones,"" Jason
Mackenzie, HTC's vice-president for North America, said in a
statement.
 MKM Partners analyst Tero Kuittinen was not surprised by
HTC's move against Apple, but said the larger question was
about HTC's patent portfolio, which he said did not measure up
to those of rival handset makers such as Nokia Oyj.
 ""I think its widely acknowledged that HTC's IP portfolio is
not particularly strong, because they got started on this way
later than they other guys,"" he said.
 CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood said HTC's patents stretched
back to the days before it was making its own branded handsets.
 ""This move might see it drawing on intellectual property
created when it was working as an ODM supplier to several
mobile carriers and other manufacturers such as Compaq,"" he
said. ODM stands for original design manufacturer.
 SMARTPHONE WARS
 According to IDC, Apple held 16 percent of the global
smartphone market in the January-March period, and HTC around 5
percent. Apple was the No.3 vendor, one slot ahead of HTC.
 ""HTC seeks, as relief, a permanent exclusion order barring
from entry into the United States all infringing portable
electronic devices and related software imported by or on
behalf of Apple,"" HTC said in its complaint.
 Investors cheered HTC's move, sending the companies
Taipei-listed shares 3.4 percent higher by midday in a broader
TAIEX market up 1.4 percent.
 ""The move means HTC has confidence in its own patents and
that will help its sales in the United States,"" said Jih Sun
Securities analyst Richard Ko. ""However, it will take some time
before we see the outcome of the lawsuit.""
 While Apple's lawsuit against HTC did not name Google as a
defendant, it was seen as a strategic move against Google,
whose mobile software powers handsets from Samsung Electronics,
Motorola Inc and others.
 Google allows smartphone makers to use its software for
free.
 Research group NPD said smartphones using Android software
passed Apple to claim the No.2 spot in the U.S. market in the
first quarter.
 The ITC, a U.S. trade panel that investigates patent
infringement involving imported goods, has become an
increasingly popular venue for patent lawsuits because it can
bar the importation of products that infringe patents.
 Legal wrangling is commonplace in the smartphone market, an
industry where many vendors work under cross-licensing
agreements. Just last month, HTC struck a licensing deal with
Microsoft Corp.
 Apple is also fighting a high-profile legal battle with
Nokia, the world's top handset maker. The companies have sued
each other over patents related to mobile device technology.

 * Euro close to record low on Swiss franc
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 13 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the
dollar on Thursday but remained vulnerable near a recent 14-month
low on concerns about the risk of a sovereign debt crisis in the
euro zone and the impact of fiscal measures on the region's
growth.
 Gains in the euro are likely to be limited as investors are
expected to use any rallies as an opportunity to sell it, traders
said, and it hovered near a recent record low against the Swiss
franc set at 1.4005 francs.
 Sterling was steady following losses made after the Bank of
England struck a dovish stance in its quarterly inflation report.
 The pound erased most of the gains made after Conservative
Party leader David Cameron took over as Britain's Prime Minister
on Tuesday.
 ""Financial markets overall have been returning to calm but
the euro remains on a downtrend,"" said Kosuke Hanao, head of
treasury products sales at HSBC.
 ""Although the panic sell-off in the euro has eased at the
moment, the downside risk still remains,"" he said.
 The euro edged up 0.3 percent from late U.S. trade on
Wednesday to $1.2645 but remained within sight of its 14-month
low near $1.25 hit last week. Near-term psychological support for
the euro is seen at that level but some in the market see the
currency falling below $1.2400 as it did in 2008.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.2 percent to 117.90 yen.
 The euro on Wednesday failed to keep gains as worries about
euro zone economic growth blunted optimism about Spain's spending
cuts and a successful bond sale in Portugal.
 Sterling was flat at $1.4830 and the euro was little changed
at 85.15 pence.
 Traders said the market was likely to take some of its cues
from share markets as a gauge of how much appetite investors had
for risk after the turbulence of the past week. Japan's Nikkei
rose 1.5 percent in early trade after Wall Street rallied on
Wednesday.
 The market was also awaiting Australian April jobs data due
at 0130 GMT, with expectations of a 20,000 rise in jobs, while
the unemployment rate was forecast to remain steady at 5.3
percent..
 The Australian dollar was steady at $0.8945.

 By Albert H. Yoon
 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - World shares climbed on
Wednesday after Spain outlined measures to cut its deficit,
easing fears that the Greek debt crisis could spread in Europe,
but doubts about the longer-term impact drove down the euro and
sent gold to record levels.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
climbed nearly 1.2 percent, led by Europe, where the
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index gained 1.3 percent.
 Concerns that a debt crisis in Greece could spill over to
other euro-zone nations with high borrowings eased on Wednesday
as Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said
Madrid would slash civil service pay by 5 percent this year,
freeze it in 2011 and cut 13,000 public sector jobs.
 ""There was some concern about whether Spain would be
serious about the measures it would have to take, so the moves
it's making"" are positive, said John Massey, portfolio manager
at SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
 Massey said cyclical companies with a lot of international
exposure, including those in the tech and industrial sectors,
had been especially vulnerable to the issues in Europe. Those
shares were among leaders on Wednesday.
 Doubts about the longer-term prospects for debt-laden
European countries, however, persisted, and worries about
euro-zone growth also cast a cloud.
 Gold hit a record high as investors sought assets seen as
havens from global instability, touching a $1,248.15 peak that
marked a 19.5 percent gain from February. Spot gold  rose
$5.60, or 0.45 percent, to $1237.60.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> surged 148.65
points, or 1.38 percent, to 10,896.91. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 15.88 points, or 1.37 percent, to
1,171.67 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 49.71
points, or 2.09 percent, to 2,425.02.
 The gold rally drove up shares of materials companies. The
PHLX gold and silver index <.XAU> gained 0.98 percent, while
Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc  shares jumped 3.9
percent to $73. Technology and industrial shares also rose.
 As investors shift attention from Europe's sovereign debt
troubles, the focus will return to the U.S. economic recovery,
though analysts predict choppy trading.
 ""The market has been increasingly conditioned to buy on the
dips now that the situation in Europe has been not resolved but
certainly stabilized in the short term,"" said Craig Peckham,
equity trading strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York.
 EURO SHEDS GAIN
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed up 1.3 percent at 1,048.56 points. The index is
now up 0.3 percent for the year having dipped into negative
territory in early May on euro-zone sovereign debt concerns.
 Financials were among the top gainers following drops in
previous sessions. Germany's Allianz jumped 3.4 percent after
first-quarter profit more than tripled.
 The euro  declined 0.28 percent at $1.2617. The
battered currency rose earlier after Spain announced its
austerity measures and data showed the euro-zone economy grew
modestly in the first quarter.
 Germany's GDP grew for the fourth consecutive quarter in
the first three months of 2010, data showed on Wednesday.
 Gains in the euro were short-lived, reflecting investor
worry over whether weaker euro-zone economies can deliver debt
cuts and the draining impact of austerity measures on Europe's
growth.
 The dollar rose against a basket of major trading-partner
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.48 percent
at 84.87. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  gained
0.47 percent at 93.12 yen.
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell as the euro zone's attempts to
staunch its budget crisis helped stabilize stock markets and
traders braced for a 10-year bond auction.
 Investors must absorb $78 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds in
auctions this week, including $24 billion of 10-year notes that
drew solid demand on Wednesday. Ten-year Treasury note yields
rose 0.05 percentage point to 3.58 percent.
 ""People like to see that fiscal responsibility talk coming
out of Europe, but I think it's more that we're watching
equities and they're stable and we have a lot of supply,"" said
Rick Klingman, managing director of Treasury trading at BNP
Paribas in New York.
 Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> index was up 0.9 percent as
Conservative leader David Cameron took the position of prime
minister at the head of a coalition government.
 Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> increased 2.4 percent and France's
CAC 40 <.FCHI> rose 1.1 percent.

 LISBON, May 12 (Reuters) - Portuguese Prime Minister Jose
Socrates will meet the leader of the main opposition party on
Thursday to discuss additional austerity measures, which the
cabinet may approve in a weekly meeting later the same day.
 The prime minister's office said on Wednesday Socrates would
meet Pedro Passos Coelho, the leader of the centre-right Social
Democrats, at 9:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) on Thursday. 
 Passos Coelho has said he proposed to the government a range
of measures to deepen budget deficit cuts in order to soothe
investor concerns, which have hammered Portuguese assets since
January, that Portugal may face a Greek-style debt crisis.
Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told Reuters
on Wednesday the government had identified a set of austerity
steps to be taken but needed to consult the PSD ""to create
conditions for carrying them out"". Officials say there is no
need to resort to a trillion-dollar euro zone safety net
approved on Monday by euro zone governments, the European
Central Bank and the IMF.
 Socrates' Socialists are ruling in a minority government and
need the support of the opposition to pass bills in parliament.
 Over the weekend, the government promised to cut this year's
deficit by an additional percentage point to 7.3 percent of GDP
and next year's gap by an extra 1.5 percentage points.
 Teixeira dos Santos said new measures would focus mainly on
spending cuts but may also include tax hikes if needed.
 State-run Lusa news agency cited an unidentified government
source as saying one of the proposals includes a 5 percent wage
cut for public companies' managers and politicians.
 TVI news channel said the government was also preparing an
extraordinary 1 percent tax on salaries below 2,375 euros
($3,017) a month and 1.5 percent on higher wages, while the
value-added tax rate may rise to 21 percent from 20 percent. 
 It said major companies and banks would also pay an
additional 2.5 percent tax on profits. TVI said the measures
should enable the deficit to be cut this year by an additional
2.1 billion euros to 7 percent of GDP.

 By Jennifer Kwan and Jeffrey Hodgson
 TORONTO, May 12 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar climbed for a
fourth straight session against its U.S. counterpart on
Wednesday, boosted by rallying equities and easing fears that
sovereign debt problems could spread in the euro zone.
 The currency  touched a high of C$1.0154 to the
U.S. dollar, or 98.48 U.S. cents, as global shares rose after
Spain outlined measures to cut its deficit, allaying fears
about Greek debt crisis contagion. [MKTS/GLOB]
 But the currency pulled back from its peak level as oil
prices dropped after government data showed rising U.S.
inventories. [O/R]
 ""Risk appetite returning overnight (is) helping the
Canadian dollar. However, we struggled to follow through with
the initial strength,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""Part of the reason being that the oil backdrop is not as
supportive as the overall risk backdrop.""
 The currency finished at C$1.0198 to the U.S. dollar, or
98.06 U.S. cents, up from C$1.0218 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.87
U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close. Wednesday marked the currency's
fourth straight close higher against the greenback.
 The Canadian dollar also made further gains against the
euro, rising as high as C$1.2849, or 77.83 euro cents, its
strongest level since July 2001.
 The currency has gained 2.4 percent so far this week as
investors focused on the country's relatively healthy
fundamentals, including its fiscal position, and strong data
such as last week's solid domestic jobs report. [ID:nN0793308]
 ""The Canadian dollar is one of the best performing
currencies this year, while the euro is the weakest major
currency,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital
Markets.
 ""Given the fiscal and monetary policy backdrop, clearly
Canada's fiscal and monetary house is in better shape than
Europe's.""
 Analysts said the focus on global risk appetite
overshadowed economic data that showed Canada's trade surplus
fell sharply and unexpectedly in March due to a drop in prices
for energy exports, while new home prices continued their
steady rise. [ID:nN12181372]
 RBC's Strauss said oil's weak performance on Wednesday kept
the currency locked in range of C$1.0150-C$1.02 to the U.S.
dollar.
 ""There's still downward momentum. My guess is we'll first
see a test of the support line rather than the resistance line
so testing C$1.0122 rather than C$1.0289,"" said Strauss.
 ""However, the move going forward will depend very much on
global risk sentiment.""
 BOND PRICES LOWER
 Canadian government bond prices were lower across the curve
as European debt worries eased, prompting investors to seek
riskier assets such as stocks.
 ""It's following along with the U.S. Treasury market with
investors just more comfortable buying riskier assets,"" said
BMO's Guatieri.
 The two-year government bond  fell 12.5 Canadian
cents to yield 2.02 percent, while the 10-year bond 
fell 15 Canadian cents to yield 3.602 percent.
 Canadian government bonds outperformed U.S. issues at the
long end, with the Canadian 10-year yield 2.8 basis points
above its U.S. counterpart, compared with 5.3 basis points on
Tuesday.
 Canada's C$3 billion auction of three-year bonds on
Wednesday met with healthy appetite, buoyed by the country's

(Updates prices, adds U.S. monthly budget gap)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S.
dollar on Wednesday as worries about euro zone economic growth
blunted optimism about Spain's spending cuts and a successful
bond sale in Portugal.
 The euro retreated to $1.2628, down 0.2 percent, after
rising to $1.2739. Analysts said investors remain worried
whether weaker euro zone economies will deliver on promises to
trim their deficits, as well as the long-term impact of
austerity measures on European growth.
 ""I still think the euro is going to continue to slide,""
said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of FX sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank in New York. ""There's going to be very little
growth in the area for quite some time.""
 The euro hit a 14-month low near $1.25 last week and is
still down nearly 12 percent in 2010. It was up 0.3 percent at
117.65 yen while the dollar rose 0.5 percent to 93.17 yen.
 Sterling fell 0.8 percent to $1.4826 after the Bank of
England said UK inflation will fall below 2 percent even if
interest rates remain at their current record low. That
stripped the pound of gains posted after Conservative Party
leader David Cameron became Britain's prime minister on
Tuesday.
 DEBT WORRIES FOR EURO ZONE, BEYOND
 The euro had edged higher overnight as narrowing bond
spreads eased debt worries and prompted speculators to cut back
on short positions against the currency; bets against the euro
hit a record high last week. Some investors were said to be
increasingly wary of the pace of the euro's recent decline.
 The euro also gained after Spain announced public spending
cuts to trim its budget deficit. The European Union announced a
$1 trillion bailout over the weekend to prevent a debt crisis
that began in Greece from spreading but has demanded countries
make tough spending cuts in exchange.
 Portugal's successful sale of 1 billion euros ($1.27
billion) of 10-year debt also raised spirits, as did Lisbon's
assurance that it did not need to draw on emergency EU funds.
 Data on Wednesday showed the euro zone economy grew 0.2
percent in the January-March period from the previous quarter,
for a 0.5 percent year-on-year gain.
 Traders said the euro remained vulnerable, with last week's
14-month low near $1.25 serving as significant support.
 The euro zone debt crisis has diverted attention from other
countries' finances, but U.S. and UK policy makers warned on
Wednesday against complacency.
 Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said growth risks had
increased over the last three months, making it more urgent for
Britain to come to grips with its deficit.
 In New York, White House budget director Peter Orszag told
Reuters Insider that lawmakers must act quickly on the budget
deficit to avoid a Greek-style crisis.
 The U.S. budget deficit hit $1.4 trillion in 2009, nearly
10 percent of growth, and could be larger this year. April
marked the 19th straight monthly gap, with the shortfall nearly
four times that seen in April 2009.
 So far, with growth on the rebound, the United States has
found ready buyers for its debt, with Wednesday's $24 billion
10-year note auction attracting solid demand.
 ""There's a sense that if you see a rebound in growth, the
deficit is sustainable,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst
at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""But
that's the way of thinking that surrounded Greece, and it could
pose a challenge, especially if you get a double-dip
recession.""

 PARIS, May 12 (Reuters) - European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet on Wednesday ruled out the idea that euro
zone countries should be excluded for not meeting budget
deficit requirements, but backed sanctions for budget sinners.
 ""I exclude that completely,"" Trichet told LCI television
when asked if sanctions for failing to meet budget deficits
could include exclusion from the euro zone.
 ""But we can imagine some sanctions such as suspending the
right to vote,"" he said.
 The European Commission proposed new sanctions on Wednesday
to enforce compliance with European Union budget rules and
called for national budgets to be coordinated with Brussels
before parliaments vote on them. [ID:nLDE64B1ZX]
 Under EU rules, deficits must not exceed 3 percent of gross
domestic product and debt must not be more than 60 percent of
GDP. But just three countries are expected to meet the deficit
criterion this year and only 13 are likely to comply on debt.
 ""If we want that things work well ... not only for the euro
zone, but Europe and the world, you need to be extremely
attentive,"" Trichet said. ""(Budget) surveillance by other
governments is a fundamental element of the euro zone, so it
makes sense (for the commission) to make proposals.""
 Trichet, who was making his second appearance in French
media on Wednesday, said it was not envisaged to issue
eurobonds to prop up governments as it would harm countries'
fiscal policies and confuse markets. [ID:nLDE64A1ZV]
 Euro zone inflation would be near 2 percent by the end of
the year, Trichet added, depending on the price of oil and raw
materials.
 ""Our mandate is to keep price stability, which is what our
co-citizens have asked us for,"" he said. ""We have said what our
definition of prices are -- less than 2 percent, close to 2
percent -- and at the end of the year ... our actual
projections are ... for euro inflation (to be) between 1.9 and
2 percent,"" he said.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2010 01:22PM ET</span>",EU agency prepares to assess first stem cell drug," * EMEA draws up guidelines for approving stem cell therapies
 * Unnamed European company plans marketing application
 
 By Ben Hirschler, European Pharmaceuticals Correspondent
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - The first regenerative medicine
based on stem cells could be filed for approval in Europe later
this year, bringing the groundbreaking medical technology a step
closer to reality.
 The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) said on Wednesday it
had been informed about the ""intent of a European manufacturer
to submit the first application for marketing authorisation for
a stem cell-based product"".
 Drugmakers typically send a letter of intent to the
London-based watchdog four to six months before a formal
application, a spokeswoman said, so this would imply a filing
towards the end of 2010.
 The EMEA declined to name the company involved.
 In preparation for the first of a possible wave of
applications, officials from the EMEA met this week with drug
company officials, regulators from the United States and Japan,
and academic scientists to discuss guidelines for approving such
treatments.
 Research into stem cells has increased dramatically in
recent years and there are currently some 40 clinical trials
underway in the European Union exploring the use of stem cells to
regenerate lost or damaged tissues and tackle various cancers.
The majority use adult mesenchymal stem cells.
 Stem cells -- which are particularly flexible when taken
from days-old embryos -- are the body's master cells and can
potentially be used to repair the heart, spinal cord, liver,
pancreas, eyes and other parts of the body.
 But their use is controversial and involves risk -- notably
the danger that foreign cells might be rejected or could
proliferate uncontrollably, leading to tumours.
 
 MANAGING RISKS
 To address some of these issues, the EMEA has drafted a
""reflection paper"" on the process for approving stem cell-based
therapies, which will be finalised by the end of 2010.
 ""Stem cells hold the promise of an unlimited source of cells
for therapeutic applications to treat patients who have no or
only unsatisfactory treatment options,"" said Christian
Schneider, chairman of the agency's Committee for Advanced
Therapies.
 ""However, these therapies bear certain risks, such as
tumourgenicity and immunorejection, and hence need to be
carefully regulated with the input from multi-disciplinary
expertise.""
 For many investors, stem cells remain off the radar screen
for now after early excitement about the science was followed by
delays and disappointments in the clinic.
 But companies pioneering the technology have not given up
and a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies are also
starting to dip their toes in the water.
 Believers see a parallel between the evolution of stem cell
treatment and monoclonal antibodies. Antibody technology was
first developed in the 1970s but it is only recently that such
drugs have become blockbusters.
 Among listed companies, Britain's ReNeuron is about to start
the world's first stroke trial using foetal stem cells, while
U.S.-based Geron hopes to restart a study using embryonic cells
to treat spinal cord injuries in the third quarter of 2010.
 Any stem cell treatment filed with the EMEA later this year
could, in theory, become commercially in 2011.
 The agency's scientific committee has instructions to issue
an opinion within 210 days of receiving an application, or 120
days in the case of an accelerated procedure, although this
regulatory clock can be stopped if more information is needed.

 ""The market has been increasingly conditioned to buy on the
dips now that the situation in Europe has been not resolved but
certainly stabilized in the short term,"" said Craig Peckham,
equity trading strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York.
 EURO SHEDS GAIN
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed up 1.3 percent at 1,048.56 points. The index is
now up 0.3 percent for the year having dipped into negative
territory in early May on euro-zone sovereign debt concerns.
 Financials were among the top gainers.
 The euro  declined 0.09 percent at $1.2642. The
battered currency rose earlier after Spain announced its
austerity measures and data showed the euro zone economy grew
modestly in the first quarter.
 Germany's GDP grew for the fourth quarter in a row in the
first three months of 2010, data showed on Wednesday.
 Gains in the euro were short-lived as investors remain
worried about whether weaker euro zone economies can deliver
debt cuts and the draining impact of austerity measures on
Europe's growth.
 The dollar rose against a basket of major trading-partner
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.29 percent
at 84.712. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up
0.28 percent at 92.94 yen.
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell as the euro zone's attempts to
stanch its budget crisis helped stabilize stock markets and
traders braced for a 10-year bond auction.
 Investors must absorb $78 billion of U.S.
Treasury bonds in auctions this week, including $24 billion of
10-year notes on Wednesday. Ten-year Treasury note yields rose
0.04 percentage point to 3.57 percent.
 ""People like to see that fiscal responsibility talk coming
out of Europe, but I think it's more that we're watching
equities and they're stable and we have a lot of supply,"" said
Rick Klingman, managing director of Treasury trading at BNP
Paribas in New York.
 In energy and commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 fell 90 cents, or 1.18 percent, to $75.47 per barrel,
 Across Europe, the FTSE 100 <.FTSE> index was up 0.9
percent as Conservative leader David Cameron took up the
position of Prime Minister, at the head of a coalition
government.
 Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> was 2.4 percent higher and France's
CAC 40 <.FCHI> rose 1.1 percent.

(Adds quotes, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro dropped against the
U.S. dollar on Wednesday, erasing early gains as worries about
euro zone growth offset news of more spending cuts by Spain and
a successful bond sale by Portugal.
 The euro fell back to around $1.2640 after hitting as high
as $1.2739 earlier in the global session as investors remain
concerned as to whether weaker euro zone economies can deliver
on promises to trim their deficits as well as the long-term
impact of austerity measures on European growth.
 ""Basically it's still a sell on rallies,"" said Brian Dolan,
chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New
Jersey. ""It's the much longer term and much more fundamental,
negative outlook for the euro zone that is keeping the euro
under pressure.""
 In midday New York trading, the euro was down 0.1 percent
at $1.2642, after earlier rising to $1.2739, according to
Reuters data. The euro zone currency hit a 14-month low near
$1.25 last week and is still down 11.7 percent so far this
year.
 Against the yen, the euro was still up 0.1 percent at
117.46. The dollar rose 0.3 percent at 92.94 yen.
 The euro had gained in early trading as narrowing bond
spreads helped ease debt worries in the euro zone and prompt a
squeeze in short euro positions, which hit a record high last
week. Some investors were said to be increasingly wary of the
pace of the euro's recent decline.
 Spain announced public spending cuts to rein in its budget
deficit as part of its drive to meet European Union targets,
after global policymakers announced a $1 trillion emergency aid
package over the weekend to stave off a wider euro zone debt
crisis.
 In the debt market, Portugal sold 1 billion euros ($1.27
billion) in 10-year bonds with demand exceeding supply.
Government officials said Portugal would not need to draw on
the funds in the euro zone rescue package.
 ""Those are some reasonably bright spots,"" Dolan said. ""To
the extent that the financial aid package provides a backstop
for sovereign debt, those auctions should have gone well.""
 STERLING FALLS
 Traders said any bounce in the euro is likely to be
short-lived. In the near term, the key support level for the
euro/dollar is near $1.25, the pair's 14-month low hit last
week.
 Investors also cited talk of a double no-touch option
position in the euro with barriers at $1.25 and $1.31. Such a
position suggests that the holder would buy euros on any drop
toward $1.25 to defend that position until it expires.
 Data on Wednesday showed the euro zone economy grew 0.2
percent in the January-March period from the previous quarter,
for a 0.5 percent year-on-year gain.
 ""I still think the euro is going to continue to slide,""
said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of FX sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank in New York.
 ""There's going to be very little growth in the area for
quite some time. The U.S. will definitely raise interest rates
before Europe at this juncture,"" he said.
 Meanwhile, sterling slipped 0.6 percent to $1.4860 after
the Bank of England struck a dovish stance in its quarterly
inflation report, raising speculation that UK interest rates
will stay low for months to come.
 The pound relinquished gains made earlier after UK
Conservative Party leader David Cameron became Britain's new
prime minister on Tuesday, having secured a power-sharing deal
between his center-right party and the Liberal Democrats to end
days of political uncertainty.

 * Formation of new government removes policy risks
 * Focus seen shifting back to improving UK fundamentals
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - The new UK government's plan to
make rapid cuts to public debt is likely to shift investor focus
back to the domestic economy, whose surprisingly strong
improvement should support UK assets in the medium term.
 After weeks of uncertainty that weighed on the pound,
government bonds and UK stocks, the coalition between the
centre-right Conservatives and the smaller Liberal Democrats
started on Wednesday to sketch out its main policy goals.
 Markets largely welcomed the coalition deal, with sterling
rising above $1.50 and UK stocks gaining ground. Gilt futures
outperformed their euro zone counterparts.
 Given the air of gloom that overhung UK markets before the
election, analysts say the new-found optimism may last.
 ""It's the best outcome for the FX and gilt markets,"" said
Jeremy Beckwith, chief investment officer of Kleinwort Benson.
""There is a bit of recovery coming through this year, which is
good news.""
 The new government's key task is to tackle a record budget
deficit running at more than 11 percent of gross domestic
product. The coalition plans to cut 6 billion pounds of spending
this financial year.
 While spending cuts are negative for growth and
deflationary, a weaker pound would have a positive economic
impact as a significant share of UK company earnings comes from
abroad, especially as global growth picked up.
 Expectations that the Bank of England will keep interest
rates low would also have a positive impact on risky assets.
 ""We are overweight UK relative to other European markets.
The UK has been quite a nice value market for us... It's not a
domestic political story that drives UK equity markets. It's
really global growth,"" said Rick Lacaille, chief investment
officer at State Street.
 Last week, sterling hit a one-year low of $1.4475 while UK
stocks fell to a 6-month trough and the spread between UK and
German government bond yields hit a 12-year high when it became
clear no party had won a majority in parliament.
 By the end of last week speculators had increased their bets
on a weaker pound, meaning the currency could strengthen as less
gloomy investors covered those positions/reversed those bets.
 The UK/German spread -- a barometer of how worried investors
about the UK fiscal outlook -- has since narrowed.
 
 RECOVERY AT CENTRE STAGE
 Although somewhat overshadowed by the election uncertainty,
data has shown the British economy is recovering. 
 Industrial output expanded in March at its fastest pace in
almost eight years, suggesting first quarter growth was stronger
than first estimates of 2 percent. The statistics office said
there were signs a weak pound had boosted exports.
 Separate data showed house price growth accelerated in April
and factory activity grew at its fastest rate in 15 years.
 ""While earlier cuts in public spending are inevitably going
to dampen economic growth, the UK recovery appears to be
gathering pace having disappointed many analysts so far,"" said
Azad Zangana, economist at Schroders.
 UK government bond yields have been rising since October,
partly on the public finances outlook and on political worries.
 Citi said 10-year gilt yields, currently at 3.853 percent,
could fall further.
 Citi's 10-year model for gilt yields sees fair value at
about 4.0 percent. It expects the risk premium based on fiscal
conditions to fall by about 25 bps if ratings agencies affirm
the country's credit outlook.
 In an early comment, ratings firm Fitch said the five-year
fixed-term parliament agreed by the coalition would help keep it
focused on cutting the deficit over the medium term.
 Analysts said the next 50 days would be key in winning
investor confidence if UK assets were to attract more buyers.
 ""This government looks set to announce much of its policy
agenda within 50 days. This 50-day period will be a testing
ground for the prospects of the coalition lasting the full four
year parliamentary cycle,"" Rabobank said in a note to clients.

 By Albert H. Yoon and Jeremy Gaunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - World shares climbed
and the euro strengthened on Wednesday as Germany's economy
continued to grow and Spain outlined measures to cut its
deficit.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS>
climbed nearly 1 percent, led by Europe, where the FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> index gained 1.4 percent.
 The bullish trading comes two days after world shares
soared nearly 5 percent following an agreement by the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund on a 750 billion euro
rescue package to put an end to Greece's debt crisis. The
steps, for the moment, reduced speculation that other euro-zone
nations would face the same predicament as Greece.
Investors have feared a debt crisis in Greece could spill
over to other euro-zone nations with high borrowings, including
Spain. That concern eased as Spain Prime Minister Jose Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero said Madrid would slash civil service pay by
5 percent this year, freeze it in 2011 and cut 13,000 public
sector jobs this year to meet European Union deficit targets.
 ""There are certainly those people who will see the steps
taken in Europe as a replay of the type of steps taken in the
United States following the Lehman collapse,"" said Rick
Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital
Management in New York. ""Ultimately that proved to be
successful in the short run for markets.""
 The EU/IMF plan has drawn a line under the worst fears
about a spread of the euro zone debt crisis, leaving investors
to look at what countries are doing to improve their finances.
Lingering doubts that the measures will work sparked a flight
to gold, which hit a record high on Wednesday.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 82.15 points,
or 0.76 percent, to 10,830.41. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> increased 9.32 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,165.11 and
the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 26.72 points, or 1.12
percent, to 2,402.03.
 Materials shares supported the market, with
Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc  rising 3.1 percent
to $72.40.
 As investors shift attention from Europe's sovereign debt
troubles, the focus will return to the U.S. economic recovery,
though analysts predict choppy trading.
 ""The market has been increasingly conditioned to buy on the
dips now that the situation in Europe has been not resolved but
certainly stabilized in the short term,"" said Craig Peckham,
equity trading strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York.
 EURO FIRMS
 The euro  gained 0.23 percent to $1.2682 on Wednesday
after Spain announced its austerity measures and data showed
the euro zone economy grew modestly in the first quarter.
 Germany's GDP grew for the fourth quarter in a row in the
first three months of 2010, data showed on Wednesday.
 Gains in the euro were limited, however, as investors
remain worried about whether weaker euro zone economies can
deliver debt cuts and the impact of austerity measures on
European growth.
 The dollar rose against a basket of major trading-partner
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.13 percent
at 84.57. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  gained
0.39 percent to 93.04.
 U.S. Treasuries prices fell on Wednesday as the euro zone's
attempts to stanch its budget crisis helped stabilize stock
markets and traders braced for a 10-year bond auction.
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose 0.04 percentage
point to 3.57 percent.
 In energy and commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 fell 2 cents, or 0.03 percent, to $76.35 per barrel,
and spot gold prices  rose $6.50, or 0.53 percent, to
$1238.50. Gold earlier touched a record $1,244.45.

 * Hopes for no more than 2.5 percent GDP contraction this yr
 * 2010 jobless rate ""considerably less"" than f'cast 10 pct
 * Says Icelanders more sceptical of EU membership
 * Says FX controls needed until at least third IMF review
 
 By Mia Shanley
 STOCKHOLM, May 12 (Reuters) - Efforts by Iceland to reach a
vital debt accord with two European nations have stalled and
talks may not regain momentum before early June, the country's
finance minister said on Wednesday.
 In a wide-ranging telephone interview, Steingrimur Sigfusson
also spoke about Iceland's financial plight and long-term
prospects, suggesting the worst of its economic woes may be over
while scepticism towards the European Union may be growing.
 Icelandic voters rejected a previous deal with Britain and
the Netherlands to clear some $5 billion of debts, forcing new
talks to settle a dispute which has ramifications for Iceland's
recovery and its ambition to join the EU.
 Since the 'Icesave' referendum in early March, little
progress has been made, although the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and Nordic lenders have released some much-needed aid to
help Iceland pursue economic recovery.
 ""It has been difficult to pick up the threads after the
referendum,"" Sigfusson told Reuters. ""Talks are on hold a bit,
but we have kept in contact. The lines are open.""
 Sigfusson, chairman of the Left-Green party, said he was
hopeful Iceland could land a new deal after Dutch elections
scheduled for June 9. The Left-Greens are the junior partner in
a coalition with the Social Democrats.
 Iceland has been wrangling for months over the terms of its
repayment plan for cash owed after its top banks collapsed
under a mountain of debt in 2008. Britain and the Netherlands
reimbursed savers in their countries who lost money in Icelandic
accounts and now they want the money back from Reykjavik.
 The dispute -- named after high interest Icesave deposit
accounts -- has made it difficult for Iceland to follow through
on a plan to gradually lift capital controls, which prop up the
local currency but also stifle investment.
 
 GROWING OPPOSITION
 The uncertainty over whether aid flows will continue means
Iceland cannot depend on having a financial buffer in the event
that any removal of controls induced an investor exodus.
 Sigfusson said capital controls needed to stay in place at
least until late July, when the IMF conducts a third review.
 ""Removing capital controls is on the agenda, but this is
related to strengthening reserves and probably the next steps
will wait until after the third review,"" he said.
 The minister was hopeful that Iceland may have already seen
the worst of its fallout. ""We would hope for no more than a 2.5
percent contraction this year, and mainly the drag is in the
first half of the year,"" he said.
 The government previously forecast a 2 to 3 percent
contraction in 2010 while the IMF expects a 3 percent slide.
 Unemployment is hovering just above 9 percent and should
start coming down. Sigfusson said this year's level would be
""considerably less"" than a government forecast of 10 percent.
 Sigfusson also said opposition on the island towards EU
membership had grown, saying that the bloc's own debt problems
had fuelled scepticism.
 Sigfusson, whose party is known for its sceptical stance
towards the EU, said debt woes in southern Europe were making
people that much more skittish about joining. ""Problems like
Greece are of course part of the debate in Iceland.""
 Reykjavik may get a green light from Brussels as soon as
June or July to start formal talks accession talks, he said. If
the bid succeeds, Icelanders will hold a referendum on joining.
 Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir has said joining the
EU and adopting the euro would bring stability to the economy.

 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Here are some of the policies in
a coalition agreement between Britain's Conservative Party and
the Liberal Democrats.
 The agreement calls for:
 
 COALITION
 -- Lib Dems get five cabinet positions. Their leader Nick
Clegg becomes deputy prime minister and treasury spokesman Vince
Cable becomes business secretary.
 
 ECONOMY
 -- A significantly accelerated reduction in the structural
budget deficit in the next five years, the main burden to be
borne by reduced spending rather than increased taxes.
 -- The Conservative Party will keep its plans to cut 6
billion pounds from non-frontline services this financial year,
subject to advice from the Treasury and Bank of England.
 -- In the run-up to Thursday's election, the Lib Dems
rubbished these planned cuts, accusing the Conservatives of
failing to give details of where and how the savings could be
made and of risking the fragile economic recovery.
 -- Partially reverse Labour's planned increase in payroll
tax. Both sides of the coalition had opposed the tax rise.
 -- Create independent Office for Budget Responsibility.
 
 TAX
 -- The Conservatives agreed to scrap their commitment to
raise the death tax threshold to 1 million pounds ($1.48
million) over the next parliament. The Lib Dems opposed that
plan because they said it would benefit only the very richest.
 -- Instead the two parties have agreed to adopt the Lib Dem
policy of raising the personal tax allowance to 10,000 pounds as
a long-term goal, with a promise to take ""real terms steps each
year towards this objective"".
 -- The parties did not agree to a Lib Dem call for a
""mansion tax"" on high-value properties or to stop tax relief for
higher rate pensioners.
 -- The parties agreed to a substantial increase in the
personal income tax allowance from April 2011, with the benefits
focused on the lower and middle classes.
 -- This will be funded by dropping plans to increase the
employee threshold for the national insurance payroll tax and by
raising capital gains tax for non-business assets so it is
closer to the level of income tax.
 -- The Lib Dems agreed not to oppose the Conservatives'
planned marriage tax allowance but do not have to vote for it.
 
 BANKING REFORM
 -- The two parties agreed to introduce a banking levy, to
tackle bonuses and to create a more competitive banking
industry. Both sides supported such a levy during the election
campaign.
 -- They committed to get more credit flowing to smaller and
medium-sized businesses. The government will look at the
Conservative proposal for a loan guarantee scheme and the Lib
Dem proposal for net lending targets for nationalised banks and
decide which is the best one.
 -- Set up an independent commission to investigate whether
to separate retail banking from investment banking. Its interim
report is due within a year.
 -- They will make proposals to give the Bank of England
control of macro-prudential regulation and oversight of
micro-prudential regulation
 
 GOVERNMENT
 -- Five-year fixed-term parliaments introduced, including
the current parliament, with the next general election to be
held on the first Thursday of May 2015. Cameron had previously
only said he would consider such a change, while the Lib Dems
had campaigned for it.
 -- Legislation introducing fixed-term parliaments would also
provide for dissolution if 55 percent or more of the House votes
in favour.
 -- A referendum on the alternative vote (AV) system. This is
a major concession by the Conservatives, who had opposed
electoral reform on this scale. Both parties will expect their
parties to vote in favour of a bill calling for the referendum
""without prejudice to the positions parties will take durin such
a referendum.""
- AV falls short of the Lib Dems' preferred option:
proportional representation, a system that more closely links
the number of votes cast with the number of parliamentary seats
a party wins.
 -- A wholly or mainly elected House of Lords, likely to
involve long single terms of office. The Lib Dems had campaigned
for an elected upper House, while the Conservatives had said
they would ""work to build consensus"" for the reform.
 
 NUCLEAR WEAPONS
 -- The agreement commits the government to keeping Britain's
nuclear weapons, a submarine-launched missile system called
Trident. The renewal of Trident, due by 2024, should be
scrutinised to ensure value for money.
 The Conservatives support the full renewal of Trident, while
the Lib Dems said during the election that a like-for-like
replacement would be unaffordable. Instead, the Lib Dems wanted
a review to find an alternative, as yet unspecified, way to
defend Britain. It supports long-term multilateral nuclear
disarmament.
 - The Lib Dems will be allowed to opt out of any vote on the
issue.
 
 NUCLEAR POWER
 -- The Lib Dems oppose building any new nuclear power
stations.
 -- They will maintain their opposition, while allowing the
government to bring forward the national planning statement for
ratification by parliament so that new nuclear construction
becomes possible.
 
 EUROPEAN UNION
 -- The new government will not join the euro or propose to
join the euro.
 -- It does not propose to transfer any new powers to the
European Union. It will legislate for a referendum lock that
requires any government proposals to transfer new powers to the
EU to be put to a referendum.
 -- The Conservatives oppose joining the euro, while the Lib
Dems want to adopt the currency when the economic conditions are
right. Clegg, seen as strongly pro-European, says now is not the
right time.
 
 IMMIGRATION
 -- In what is being seen as a major concession to Cameron,
the Lib Dems have agreed to an annual cap on non-EU immigration.
 -- An end to child detention in immigration centres.
WELFARE
 -- The Conservatives' welfare reform programme to be
implemented in full.
 
 EDUCATION
 -- The Conservatives' plans for schools reform can go ahead,
provided all schools are held properly accountable.
 -- Additional funding for the pupil premium, as called for
by the Lib Dems, which would raise school funding for poor
children.
 
 CIVIL LIBERTIES
 -- The parties agreed on a major programme of civil
liberties, including a ""Freedom"" bill. They would scrap planned
identity cards, the national identity register and the next
generation of biometric passports.
 -- They would extend the scope of the Freedom of Information
Act, review libel laws to protect freedom of speech and further
regulate closed-circuit television cameras.
 
 ENVIRONMENT
 -- They back a major environmental programme to encourage a
low-carbon, eco-friendly economy, including a green investment
bank and a smart electricity grid.
 
 TRANSPORT
 -- Agreement to scrao a third runway at Heathrow airport and
to refuse additioanl runways at Gatwick and Stansted;
 -- Air passenger duty replaced with a per flight duty;
 -- High speed rail plans established.

 * Both imports and exports up in sign of global recovery

 WASHINGTON, May 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit hit
its widest point in more than a year in March, with a jump in
imports swamping a rise in exports as the global economy
strengthened, a government report showed on Wednesday.
 The trade gap increased 2.5 percent to $40.4 billion, the
largest since December 2008, up slightly from a revised
estimate of $39.4 billion for February.
 Wall Street analysts surveyed before the report had
expected a smaller increase to $40.1 billion.
 The steadily rising trade gap, after falling sharply in
2009, shows the difficulty of curbing ""global imbalances"" as
world economic recovery takes hold and countries return to old
spending and savings habits.
 But with sovereign debt problems in Europe raising fears of
a renewed global crisis, Pierre Ellis, senior economist with
Decision Economics in New York, said the United States could
take solace in the trade report.
 ""Heading into a riskier period for the world economy,
strong exports put us on a better footing,"" Ellis said.
 U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday while Treasury debt
prices held onto losses after the report.
 ""The data is generally in line with expectations,"" said Joe
Manimbo, market analyst with Travelex Global Business Payments
in Washington, adding it would have little impact on currency
values.
 Both U.S. imports and exports were the highest since
October 2008, when world trade was in the early stage of a free
fall caused by the global financial crisis.
 Combined U.S. imports of goods and services rose 3.1
percent in March to $188.3 billion, as the average price for
imported oil rose to $74.32 per barrel, the highest since
October 2008.
Imports of goods alone were also the highest since October
2008, as were individual categories for foods, feeds and
beverages, industrial supplies and materials and consumer
goods.
 Meanwhile, a separate report from the Mortgage Bankers
Association showed U.S. mortgage applications rose last week,
reflecting a jump in demand for home refinancing loans as
interest rates reached their lowest level since mid-March.
 U.S. exports of goods and services increased 3.2 percent in
March to $147.9 billion, led by gains for consumer goods and
industrial supplies and materials. U.S. goods exports were
$102.7 billion.

 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro edged higher on
Wednesday after Spain announced more austerity measures and
data showed the euro zone economy grew modestly in the first
quarter.
 Gains in the euro were limited, however, as investors
remain worried about whether weaker euro zone economies can

 * Sterling steady vs euro, dollar as investors await detail
 * FTSE-100 lags Europe gains, concerns about spending cuts
 
 By Fiona Shaikh and Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Britain's financial markets had
mixed fortunes on Wednesday as relief about Britain's new
Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition was tempered by
concerns about the harsh austerity measures that lie ahead.
 Surprisingly dovish quarterly growth and inflation forecasts
from the Bank of England reinforced expectations the economy
could be in for a rough ride while spending cuts and tax rises
are implemented to deal with Britain's record budget deficit.
 BoE Governor Mervyn King said the new government was right
to start making cuts this year to convince markets of its
determination to tackle Britain's record budget deficit, but
warned of hard times ahead.
 ""It's not going to be easy. It's going to be a difficult few
years as we face these adjustments,"" King told a news conference
after the BoE published its Inflation Report.
 The pound fell almost a cent against the dollar before
steadying to around $1.4937 by 1203 GMT. The euro strengthened
by half a cent against the pound to a session high of 85.12
pence after strong euro zone data, but subsided to 84.98 pence
by midday GMT.
 ""The bottom line is that CPI will stay under the 2 percent
inflation target ... interest rates won't rise as much as market
expectations. Sterling sold off on this,"" said Adam Cole, global
head of fx strategy at RBC.
 Short sterling interest rate futures from March 2011 out
were as much as 10 ticks up and analysts said contracts were now
not pricing in rate hikes from the BoE until next year.
 Conservative Party leader David Cameron, whose party won the
most seats in last week's inconclusive election, took over as
British prime minister late on Tuesday after the sudden
resignation of Gordon Brown ended 13 years of Labour rule.
 Cameron will lead Britain's first coalition government since
1945 with Lib Dem party leader Nick Clegg as his deputy and the
Conservatives' George Osborne as finance minister.
 Gilt futures outperformed their euro zone counterparts by
almost half a point on expectations that the coalition would
enact measures swiftly to shore up the public finances.
 The new government is expected to implement Conservative
plans to cut six billion pounds of spending this financial year,
earlier than Labour or the Lib Dems had campaigned for.
 And the gilt contract hit a session high of 117.36 -- up
almost 80 ticks on the day -- after King said it would be wrong
to rule out the central bank extending its quantitative easing
scheme, but it was trading at 117.04 by 1214 GMT.
 In the cash market, the spread between 10-year gilt and Bund
yields -- a barometer of investor sentiment -- narrowed to 91
basis points from around 96 on Tuesday. It had tightened to just
85 basis points -- a six-week low after King's comments on QE.
 The internationally focused FTSE 100 was up 0.4
percent, underperforming greater gains for the pan-European
FTSEurofirst 300. 
 ""There's relief a stable government is in place to lead the
country, but it can't hide the fact there are huge economic
issues for them to address, and that is what is dragging some
stocks lower,"" said Jimmy Yates, head of equities at CMC
Markets. 
 
 DEVIL IN THE DETAIL
 Cameron's succession removed some of the uncertainty that
drove sterling to a 13-month low against the dollar last week
after an inconclusive election gave no party an absolute
majority in parliament.
 Analysts said investors were now waiting for more detail on
the new administration's debt cutting plans.
 The Conservatives had pledged in their election manifesto to
hold an emergency budget within 50 days of entering office.
 The dire state of the UK's public finances, with a budget
deficit of over 11 percent of GDP, has been a cause of concern
for ratings agencies, with investors sensitive to the potential
for a downgrade of the UK's sovereign rating which would hamper
efforts to pay off the deficit.
 ""If they manage to put through the austerity measures, you
can presume the triple-A rating is pretty safe,"" said Charles
Diebel, strategist at Nomura. ""But that's a slow burn. It's cold
hard facts we're waiting for now.""
 Ratings agency Fitch said the 5-year fixed term parliament
agreed by the coalition should help maintain the government's
focus on the medium-term fiscal outlook, although it was waiting
for detail on the course of action it will take.
 ""While the coalition is uncharted territory, the agreement
to a five-year term reduces the risk of a government of short
duration which may have less incentive to focus on medium-term
fiscal challenges,"" Fitch said in a statement.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2010 08:44AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Key risks to watch in coalition-era Britain," By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Britain's inconclusive May 6
general election has produced its first coalition government
since 1945, with the new Conservative Prime Minister David
Cameron in partnership with third-placed Liberal Democrats.
 Investors will be relieved that at least some clarity has
emerged, but will be looking keenly at how it will tackle a
budget deficit forecast at 11.1 percent of output this year.
 Sterling, gilts and stocks all suffered after the election
gave no one party in overall control.
 Markets broadly welcomed Tuesday night's coalition
agreement, with gilts futures and sterling enjoying a steady
performance overnight but losing some ground later to trade
broadly steady versus the dollar.
 Below are the key political risks to watch in the coming
days and months.
 
 GOVERNMENT MAKE-UP, POLICY
 Among key nominations announced so far are Lib Dem leader
Nick Clegg as deputy prime minister and Conservative finance
spokesman George Osborne as chancellor.
 The Lib Dems will get five cabinet positions as well as a
host of junior minister posts. Markets will watch how much
influence will be given to populist Lib Dem finance spokesman
Vince Cable, who was nominated UK business secretary.
 Conservative and Lib Dem frontbenchers have been hammering
out policy details for days, with some details already emerging
late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday.
 What to watch:
 -- Markets would like stable government for at least a
couple of years to address the deficit, and will be wary of
signs of disputes over issues such as Europe.
 -- What happens to the ousted Labour party? Former Prime
Minister Gordon Brown is standing down as party leader, ushering
in a leadership battle expected to be between former Foreign
Secretary David Milliband, his brother Ed and perceived more
leftist contender Ed Balls amongst others. How quickly Labour
can reassert itself as a credible opposition or possible
government could also impact market expectations of how long the
current government will last.
 
 ADDRESSING THE DEFICIT
 The Conservatives had pledged an emergency budget within 50
days if they defeated Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and
can be expected to push ahead with one with their new coalition
partners.
 That will be key to credibility with both investors and
credit ratings agencies, who have threatened to strip the UK of
its AAA credit rating if public debt is not reined in. The
Conservatives had periodically made explicit comparisons to
Greece -- something they can be expected to stop doing now they
are in office.
 The Lib Dems appear to have agreed with the Conservative
plan to begin cutting immediately, with 6 billion pounds in cuts
to normal frontline services this financial year subject to
advice from the Treasury and Bank of England.
 The tax picture appears mixed, with the Conservatives
abandoning their commitment to raise the death tax threshold to
1 million pounds ($1.48 million) from 325,000 pounds and moving
towards Lib Dem proposals to raise the personal tax allowance to
10,000 pounds as a long-term goal.
 What to watch:
 -- Investors will want to see a properly costed tax plan,
detailed spending proposals and a clear strategy to reduce the
deficit.
 -- Credit rating agencies have held off any moves until
after the election, but any downgrade or outlook change could
seriously hurt sterling, gilts and filter through to stocks.
 -- What divisions emerge within the ruling coalition as a
consequence of the cuts? Backbench rebellions could also
threaten policy-making -- albeit much less than they would have
in a minority Conservative administration.
 
 TACKLING THE BANKS
 Equities markets in particular watching closely to see what
line the new government takes with Britain's banking sector.
 According to a Conservative source, the two parties have
agreed to introduce a banking levy, tackle bonuses and create a
more competitive banking industry, but there are no details yet.
 What to watch:
 -- what happens with suggestions by Cable and the Lib Dems
to break large banks up into retail and investment banking arms.
The coalition deal will examine this option, producing an
interim report within a year. This would be extremely negative
for shares in banks such as Barclays and HSBC.
 -- Can the new government get credit flowing again? The
government will look at both the Conservative proposal for a
loan guarantee scheme and a LibDem proposal for net lending
targets for nationalised banks and decide which to follow.
 
 EXTERNAL, INTERNAL STRAINS
 Cameron's government takes over a country fighting a war in
Afghanistan, an issue which could become a key dividing point
within the coalition. The Lib Dems are much less enthusiastic
about the war and might oppose any further increase in troop
numbers.
 It might also face an upsurge in dissident republican
violence in Northern Ireland, with several attempted bombings so
far this year -- although he has much more freedom on Northern
Ireland policy than if he was locked in a minority government
dependent on Ulster Unionists for support.
 Social and labour unrest is also a worry, given the scale of
austerity measures facing Britain. Companies such as British
Airways are already facing industrial action, which could spread
to the public sector.
 The relatively Eurosceptic Conservatives and more
Europe-friendly Lib Dems could also fracture over relations with
the EU.
 What to watch:
 -- Does the EU agree further bailout packages for troubled
fringe euro economies? The outgoing Labour government largely
refused to contribute funding, arguing the problem was one for
the euro zone rather than the EU. Cameron would likely do the
same. But any worsening in relations with the EU could imperil
Lib Dem support for the coalition.
 -- Does NATO request more troops for Afghanistan?

 * Economic crisis sets back EU gas demand about 5 years
 * Both issues impact South Stream and Nabucco projects
 
 By Pete Harrison and Michael Kahn
 BRUSSELS/PRAGUE, May 12 (Reuters) - Growing Chinese
competition for gas and weaker-than-expected European demand
have raised new hurdles to two giant gas pipeline projects:
Nabucco and South Stream.
 The issue is not as pressing for the Russian-backed South
Stream project, driven more by politics than economics.
 But Nabucco's backers need to quickly line up supply deals
before starting work on the 3,300-kilometre (2,050-mile)
pipeline to bring Central Asian gas to Europe, analysts say.
 Europe wants the gas to curb its dependence on Russia, its
biggest supplier, but also an occasional political rival. But
getting those pipelines built may not be easy.
 The economic crisis has put such a dent in demand that
Nabucco will not be needed until 2020, but if it waits too long,
China might have bought all the available gas supplies from
countries such as Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.
 ""The major factor here is China,"" said analyst Susanne Nies
of French think-tank Ifri. ""There is a risk that fast-growing
China absorbs all the gas available to Europe as LNG (liquefied
natural gas) and the gas from Central Asia.""
China and central Asian countries opened their first
cross-border gas pipeline in December, which will be able to
pump up to 40 billion cubic metres of gas a year to China by
2013.
 In Europe, Nabucco shareholder RWE has pushed back the
expected signing of an important supply deal with Turkmenistan
from the first to the second half of the year.
 
 SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
 European Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger denied
Chinese competition posed a threat.
 ""In the Caspian region there are immense gas reserves,"" he
told Reuters. ""This is enough gas for Europe, the Chinese and
others.
 ""For Nabucco we only need 31 billion cubic metres per year,
which is a tiny fraction of these reserves,"" he added. ""If all
the gas would be delivered via Nabucco, we could fill the
pipeline for more than 5,000 years.""
 China's foray into Central Asia also represents a challenge
to Moscow, which still sees the predominantly Muslim region as
part of its sphere of influence.
 Russia's South Stream project involving a 900-kilometre
pipeline is strengthened by its political intent to circumvent
Ukraine to get gas to Europe under the Black Sea -- but it too
faces commercial challenges.
 Weakened European demand may make it more of a cost than a
profit centre for state energy firm Gazprom. 
 Nies thinks Gazprom has limited appetite for investing the
20 billion euros needed for South Stream, especially with
Ukraine becoming politically closer to Moscow since elections
this year. Exports along that route could be bolstered for just
5.5 billion euros, she says.
 Mikhail Korchemkin of U.S.-based consulting firm East
European Gas Analysis said: ""The Russian projects are political
so they don't need any economic justification. Russian pipelines
are simply to divert existing deliveries to new routes.""
 ""Russia is making a mistake and not looking at the demand
side of the projects,"" he added. ""It means the money invested
into the pipeline will not generate new profits. They will have
new costs. It will reduce profits.""
 
 DEMAND DESTRUCTION
 With economic contagion spreading throughout Europe from
Greece, any changes to gas demand forecasts are likely to be
downgrades, but commissioner Oettinger remains confident.
 ""The current gas glut will only last some years, and demand
will pick up again in the second half of the decade,"" he said.
 Analysts say Europe's spreading economic crisis has created
a setback to European gas demand of around 5 years.
 ""In 2009, we have seen unprecedented demand destruction,""
said Anne-Sophie Corbeau of the Paris-based International Energy
Agency. ""Preliminary data shows gas demand has fallen 5 percent
in 2009 for OECD-Europe.
 Italian energy company Edison, which backs the smaller ITGI
import project to Italy, takes a similar view.
 ""Demand has been slowed by the financial crisis, so the
urgency of building new major import infrastructure for security
of supply is not as it was last year,"" says Elio Ruggeri, head
of gas infrastructure at Italy's Edison.
 That is not to say that Europe does not need any new gas
import pipelines, just less than was forecast before -- and
maybe no more than is already under construction.
 Such projects include the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia
to Germany and upgrades to import pipelines from north Africa,
such as Medgaz and Greenstream.
 ""In 2015, we might have a need for additional imports
ranging from 40 to 70 bcm a year, and if you add up the volumes
of all the projects already under construction, it also comes to
around 70 bcm,"" said Ruggeri.
 ""A major bulk pipeline like Nabucco will be needed by 2020,
but it is not any longer urgent for 2015,"" said Ruggeri. ""A
combination of EU interconnections like the ones foreseen by the
ITGI Project is what is needed for 2015.""
 Meanwhile, smaller import projects will be vying to grow
their market share, possibly crowding out Nabucco.

 * Intellectual property rights versus access to medicine
 * EU ready to clarify rules to ensure access

(Recasts with Brazil, India comments)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 12 (Reuters) - India and Brazil launched a trade
dispute against the European Union and the Netherlands on
Wednesday, saying their seizures of generic drugs were hurting
healthcare in poor countries and disrupting international trade.
 The row turns on one of the most sensitive issues dividing
rich and poor nations -- the intellectual property rights of
corporations such as makers of pharmaceuticals versus access to
affordable medicine for people in developing countries.
 India said the repeated seizures were based on allegations
of the infringement of intellectual property rights in the
country of transit, even though the generic drugs in question
were legal in their countries of origin and destination.
 ""Our first concern is that intellectual property issues are
being raised on drug consignments where they are absolutely not
merited and the fact that international transit guarantees are
being violated,"" India's ambassador to the World Trade
Organization, Ujal Singh Bhatia, told a news conference.
 He said the seizures were part of a concerted effort by rich
nations to stiffen the current intellectual property regime and
claw back special treatment for developing countries.
 EU officials, who argue that their checks aim to identify
counterfeit medicine rather than stopping people in developing
countries from getting treatment, had been hoping to negotiate a
way out of the dispute.
 EU trade spokesman John Clancy said the European Commission
had been discussing the problem with India for months and
signalled its intention to modify legislation to clarify rules
on medicine in transit.
 ""The EU remains fully committed to ensuring that people in
the world's poorest countries can access affordable medicines,""
Clancy said in a statement.
 Bhatia said India had repeatedly asked the EU and Dutch
authorities for a list of seizures so that India could
investigate companies making fake drugs.
 ""Till today we have not received details of even one
consignment where there was an allegation of sub-standard
medicines,"" he said.
 
 BLOOD PRESSURE DRUG
 The case dates back to the seizure by Dutch customs in
December 2008 of a blood pressure drug en route from India to
Brazil.
 Dutch officials seized a shipment of losartan, the generic
name for Merck & Co's  blood pressure drug Cozaar, which
was developed jointly by Merck and E I du Pont de Nemours & Co.
 The drugs -- enough to treat 300,000 people for one month --
had been exported by India's Dr Reddys Laboratories, which flew
them back to India after customs released them.
 The Dutch port of Rotterdam is a major transit hub as well
as key point of exit and entry for Europe.
 India says Dutch customs seized at least 19 consignments of
drugs in 2008 and 2009, including treatments for blood pressure,
cardiological conditions, HIV AIDS, schizophrenia and dementia.
French and German customs also seized drugs.
 Brazil's WTO ambassador, Roberto Azevedo, said the case was
not limited to Brazil and India. It was the potential for
continuing violations not the number of seizures that counted.
 ""This is a systemic issue. Any seizure from anywhere along
those lines of allegations of infringement of intellectual
property rights in the country of transit in our view is
illegal,"" he said. ""The regulation itself is illegal.""
 The risk of seizures meant generics producers in developing
countries were avoiding shipping goods via Europe, driving up
transport costs and so undermining the purpose of using cheap
generics, he said.
 ""The actions by the EU have widespread consequences
including the work and the cost of health programmes in the
developing countries,"" he said.
 Both India and Brazil requested consultations with the EU
and Netherlands on the issue, the first formal step in a WTO
dispute, and confirming a threat reported by Reuters in October
last year.
 They now have 60 days to try and resolve it, otherwise
Brazil and India can ask the WTO to set up a panel of experts to
rule whether the European actions breach international trade
rules. It is still unclear whether the consultations will run in
parallel or be consolidated into a single dispute.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2010 07:56AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Debt deal pushes Euro investors back to fundamentals," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - If it has done one thing the
giant debt rescue plan promulgated by the European Union and
International Monetary Fund has allowed European investors to
start looking at fundamentals again.
 As a result, the future direction of euro-denominated assets
may again be dictated by investor views on economic growth and
corporate profits health rather than by fear of a spiralling
debt disaster.
Strategists from leading European fund firms have already
begun adjusting some allocations to euro-denominated assets
upwards in light of the 750 billion euro plan to halt the spread
of Greece's sovereign debt crisis.
 France's AXA Investment Managers decided on Tuesday to
increase its exposure to euro zone stocks following last
weekend's EU/IMF agreement.
 ""We have put some money back to work,"" said Franz Wenzel, a
startegist at the firm in Paris.
 He said AXA IM was now neutral on euro zone equities having
gone undwerweight in April as the Greece crisis gathered steam.
 In a similar vein, one of Generali Investments' chief
allocators said it was time to gently re-embrace euro zone
equities.
 ""We have been fairly cautious, quite franky, and we took out
exposure,"" the Italian firm's head of research, Klaus Wiener,
told Reuters from is office in Cologne.
 ""I would be willing to increase again as a result of the
rescue package.""
 Such moves may not reverse the flight from the euro zone
seen in the past few months.
 Funds tracker EPFR Global, for example, reports that
European equity funds had more than $2 billion in net outflows
in the week to May 5, the most in a year.
 But recovering confidence could put a floor under such
losses, at least as far as the debt crisis is concerned.
 
 PILE DRIVER
 The issue for investors is not that the rescue package
solves Europe's debt problems. On the contrary, they are more
keen than ever to see action being taken, as epitomised by
Wednesday's positive market reaction to Spain's austerity plan.
 Rather, the rescue plan is seen as authorities having taken
a huge mallet to a loose peg that was threatening to bring down
the tent.
 Add to that an agreement among central banks to help out and
the actual purchase of euro zone bonds by Europe's central banks
and the mallet turned into a pile driver.
 ""The risk factor for the forseeable future has shrunk very,
very, very signifantly,"" said William De Vijlder, chief
investment officer of BNP Paribas Investment Partners.
 But that does not mean that investors are likely to dive
into euro zone assets willy-nilly.
 De Vijlder, for example, says that while demand for euro
zone bonds and stocks should normalise now that the abnormal
threat has been contained, the future is not necessarily rosey.
 His firm is expecting growth to slow in the second half.
 ""The theme that will dominate for the second half of this
year is that, one, there is declining momentum in terms of
leading indicators,"" he said.
 ""The second element is that investors will increasingly
factor in ... the prospect of pretty significant belt-tightening
across the globe. This will fuel some worries on growth in
2011.""
 On top of that, the underlying structural problems facing
the euro zone when it comes to debt remain.
 But the Greek crisis and the fear that it would spread did
mask some relatively bullish news for investors.
 There are signs of improving growth in the U.S. economy --
including now in jobs creation -- and the latest corporate
earnings season has been robust.
 The euro zone's economy itself is also growing, albeit
tentatively.
 So how investors play things from here should depend on how
they view the unfolding economic climate. Assuming, of course,
that the newly secured tent peg remains that way.

 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro edged up on Wednesday,
reversing early losses as euro zone peripheral government bond
yields dropped, partly easing debt concerns and as data showed
the single currency zone grew modestly in the first quarter.

deficit as part of its drive to meet European Union targets,

 European central banks were seen buying Portuguese, Irish

 Traders said these factors helped to prompt a squeeze in
short euro positions created during its tumble to a 14-month low
of $1.2510 last week, while analysts said some investors were
growing wary of the speed of the euro's recent depreciation.
 ""Some in the market are worried that the pace of the euro's

banks,"" said Adam Cole, global head of currency strategy at RBC.
 ""We're not convinced that's the case, but that's what the
market's thinking about this morning.""
 That view, along with data showing a 0.2 percent quarterly
rise in euro zone GDP, which followed a bigger-than-expected
expansion in Germany and Italy, were helping to boost the euro,
he added. [ID:nLDE64A127] [ID:nLDE64B0BD] [ID:nLDE64B0ZL]

 By Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, May 12 (Reuters) - Estonia won the green light on
Wednesday to join the euro zone in 2011 and become its 17th
member in what is likely to be the crisis-hit currency area's
last enlargement for at least four years.
 Despite European Central Bank doubts about how long Estonia
can hold down inflation, the European Union's executive arm said
the former Soviet republic of 1.4 million people was ready for
the euro, unlike other, bigger hopefuls such as the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland.
 ""Estonia has achieved a high degree of sustainable economic
convergence and is ready to adopt the euro on 1 January 2011,""
Olli Rehn, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn said in a statement.
 If, as expected, it is given the final go-ahead by EU
finance ministers, the Baltic country will become the fifth of
the states that joined the Union in 2004 to adopt the currency.
Slovenia entered the euro zone in 2007, Cyprus and Malta in 2008
and Slovakia in 2009.
 The Commission's decision could reassure other candidates
that the euro zone remains open for expansion despite Greece's
debt crisis which has fuelled tensions in the currency area and
forced it to create a $1-trillion emergency aid mechanism for
members facing solvency problems.
 But euro zone turmoil has dampened enthusiasm towards the
euro among candidates. Polish Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski
said on Wednesday Warsaw was in no rush to join the currency
area, which needs time to ""refurbish"" after the Greek crisis.
 In a separate report, the ECB said there were mixed signals
on Estonia's readiness to adopt the euro because of questions
over the country's convergence sustainability in the future,
notably about inflation. [ID:LDE64B0JK]
 Very low inflation in Estonia -- which averaged -0.7 percent
over the last 12 months, compared to the 1.0 percent benchmark
-- was due to mainly temporary factors, it said.
""In sum, there are concerns regarding the sustainability of
inflation convergence in Estonia,"" the ECB said.
 Under EU law, the Commission's recommendation is binding.
The ECB's ar not.
 
 TOUGH REFORMS REWARDED
 The Commission said that other euro candidates -- Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland
Romania and Sweden -- were not ready.
 Their inflation rates are too high, budget deficits too wide
or most have not yet joined the ERM II currency system, a
stability test for euro zone membership, it said.
 ""The nine member states with a so-called 'derogation' (to
the euro) have made uneven progress on the road to the single
currency,"" the Commission said.
 A recent Reuters poll among economists, mirrored by a report
by credit rating agency Fitch, said those countries were
forecast to adopt the euro in 2014-2016 at the earliest.
 The Commission's recommendation crowns reforms that have
turned Estonia into one of the most open and liberal economies
in the 27-nation EU and a darling of investors.
 It rewards Estonia's austerity programme, which was
implemented despite deep recession last year and has ensured the
country's budget deficit is below 3 percent of gross domestic
product -- one criterion for joining the euro zone.
 The country cut its deficit to 1.7 percent of GDP last year
despite an economic contraction of nearly 15 percent. Estonia
also has one of the smaller national debts in the EU -- 7.2
percent of GDP.
 The adoption of the euro is not expected to change much for
Estonia's investors and its citizens since the country has long
kept its kroon currency fixed against the euro in a currency
board. The exchange rate is expected to be kept during the
currency changeover.
 The Commission said Estonia, which accounts for a tiny
fraction of the euro zone's 10-trillion-euro ($12,700-billion)
economy, met all the entry criteria on inflation, interest
rates, its budget deficit, public debt and currency stability.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro reversed early losses to
edge higher on Wednesday as euro zone peripheral government bond
yields dropped, partly easing debt concerns as data showed the
single currency zone grew only modestly in the first quarter.
 Spain announced public spending cuts to rein in its budget
deficit and as European central banks were seen buying
Portuguese, Irish and Greek government bonds.
 But the euro's rebound remained below the near $1.31 level
seen shortly after a $1 trillion emergency aid package was
announced on Monday to stave off a euro zone debt crisis.
 By 1002 GMT, the euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2708, after
hitting a session high of $1.2739. Traders said stop-loss buys
were triggered above $1.2720, accelerating the gains, with hedge
funds buying back euros. Offers were seen around $1.2740.
 Earlier data which showed higher-than-expected growth in
Germany and Italy helped to trigger a short squeeze in the
single currency. Latest data from Commodity Futures Trading
showed currency speculators had boosted net euro short positions
to a euro lifetime high in the week ended May 4.
 Traders also cited talk of a double no-touch option position
in the euro with barriers at $1.25 and $1.31. Such a position
suggests that the holder would buy euros on any drop towards
$1.25 to defend that position until it expires.
 Some expect the bounce to be short-lived.
 ""The data may provide some support, but the bigger picture
for the euro is still negative,"" said Ian Stannard, senior
currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 
 EURO ZONE GROWTH MODEST
 Euro zone gross domestic product growth came in as expected
at 0.2 percent for the first quarter. Against the yen, the
euro was up 0.6 percent at 118.02 yen.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
reiterated on Wednesday the central bank's stance to sterilise,
or drain excess liquidity from its government bond buying.
 ""All liquidity which is being put in through these
interventions will be taken back. We are not running money
printing presses,"" he said on French radio.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent at 92.89 yen.
 Some also remained wary after the Wall Street Journal
reported U.S. federal investigators are probing whether Morgan
Stanley misled investors about mortgage-derivative products it
helped design and sometimes bet against.
 Sterling was tracking the euro's rally, trading up around
0.4 percent versus the dollar at $1.5018 after rising to a
session high of $1.5036. Against the euro, the pound was broadly
unchanged at 84.65 pence.
 UK Conservative Party leader David Cameron became Britain's
new prime minister on Tuesday after securing a power-sharing
agreement between his centre-right party and the smaller Liberal
Democrats. 
 They plan to stick to the Conservatives' line of taking
immediate steps to reduce the budget deficit, seen rising to
more than 11 percent of GDP this year, by cutting 6 billion
pounds in non-frontline services this year. But there was
uncertainty in the market about the new government's overall
deficit reduction plans.

 By Nigel Davies
 MADRID, May 12 (Reuters) - Spain will cut wages of state
employees and slash investment spending, sparking union anger at
the government's toughest moves yet to rein in a budget deficit
some feared could ignite a bigger version of the Greek crisis.
 Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's fresh
austerity measures came hours after U.S. President Barack Obama
pressed him to be ""resolute"" in efforts to implement economic
reforms, and after conversations with German Chancellor Angela
Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. [ID:nN11663212]
 ""We need to make a singular, exceptional and extraordinary
effort to cut our public deficit and we must do so now that the
economy is beginning to recover,"" Zapatero told parliament on
Wednesday as he detailed the cuts totalling 15 billion euros
($19.05 billion) in 2010 and 2011. 
 Civil service salaries will be cut by 5 percent in 2010 and
frozen in 2011, and more than 6 billion euros will be cut from
public investment, said Zapatero, who has been widely criticised
for being slow to take decisive action against the crisis.
 News of the austerity plan, which follows news of a $1
trillion fund to prop up weaker euro zone states, cut the yield
on Spanish 10-year Treasury bonds  to around 3.97
percent from around 4.02 percent and helped push U.S. stocks
higher.
 ""These measures ... are what the market was waiting for,
although not many people thought the prime minister would dare
to take them,"" said Nicolas Lopez, of Madrid brokerage M&G
Valores.
 The move was badly received by unions which, while so far
maintaining good relations with the Socialist government, have
already put the brakes on a government move to raise the
retirement age to 67 from 65. The government had until now
indicated it would not cut wages.
 ""The proposed cuts merit outright rejection,"" said Ignacio
Fernandez Toxo, leader of Spain's biggest union confederation,
Comisiones Obreras, saying that unions would take some time to
consider their response.
 But the leader of the second-largest labour grouping,
Candido Mendez of the Union General de Trabajadores, sounded a
more conciliatory note, saying that he still thought it possible
unions might agree to key labour market reforms.
 Unions only represent about 16 percent of Spanish workers
and marches earlier this year against earlier austerity measures
were tiny in comparison with the mass fury unleashed by their
Greek equivalents. 
 
 STRIKES TO COME?
 But Zapatero's latest measures for the first time directly
target the unions' main constituency -- public sector workers --
which could put labour leaders, criticised by some of their
members for inaction, under pressure to take more aggressive
action.
 Civil service jobs in Spain are prized for their fixed hours
and stable conditions, although many Spaniards see the public
sector as having been protected so far from the vicious cuts of
a labour market suffering the highest unemployment in the
eurozone.
 ""The unions didn't strike against the fact there are four
million unemployed. If they do so now because of the public
sector wage cuts, then I will go out and make a counter-strike,""
said 30-year old Madrid engineer Pablo Almarcha.
 Juan Carlos Garcia, a 40-year-old unemployed teacher married
to a civil servant also welcomed news of the salary cuts.
 ""I think cutting civil servant salaries is an excellent
idea, even though I live with one,"" he said.
 The cuts, which follow an earlier 50 billion euros in
austerity measures which failed to convince markets, aim to
reduce the budget deficit to 9.3 percent of gross domestic
product this year, from 11.2 percent in 2009, 6 percent in 2011
and the 3 percent limit stipulated by European rules by 2013.
 ""These measures go in the right direction,"" said European
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Ollie Rehn.
 But others warned that the cuts, however harsh, may not be
enough for Spain, whose public sector is coming under strain
from huge debts accumulated by companies and households during a
property boom. Unemployment has hit 20 percent, and economists
already doubt that Spain's relatively uncompetitive economy will
be able to reach the levels of economic growth that underpin the
government's deficit forecasts.
 
 DEEPER CUTS NEEDED
 Data released on Wednesday showed the economy grew for the
first time in nearly two years in the first quarter, expanding
0.1 percent quarter on quarter.
 ""We feel that Spain is going to fall short of the
government's latest growth projections of 1.8 percent in 2011,
2.9 percent in 2012 and 3.1 percent in 2013. This could imply
that even deeper spending cuts or steeper tax rises will be
required,"" said Raj Badiani, of IHS Global Insight.
 The measures were announced after European Union and
International Monetary Fund officials agreed at the weekend on a
$1 trillion emergency fund for weak euro zone countries that
have been hit by debt crises.
 ""After the weekend EU meeting it became very clear Spain
and Portugal, and particularly Spain, would have to go the extra
mile in cutting the deficit,"" said Jose Garcia Zarate, an
economist at 4Cast.
 Portugal also unveiled extra fiscal measures over the
weekend, including putting on ice the building of a new airport
in Lisbon.

 * Stark says ECB will hold govt bonds until maturity
 * Trichet says no specific target for bond buys
 * ECB will resist any pressure to allow higher inflation
 
 By Sarah Marsh and Phil Blenkinsop
 BERLIN/BRUSSELS May 12 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank
vowed on Wednesday the euro would survive a battering inflicted
by euro zone's debt crisis and one top policymaker revealed the
bank would hold acquired government bonds until their end date.
 The dire state of public finances of Greece and other euro
zone members such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland have
driven the euro down sharply over the last month and cast doubt
over the single currency project.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet came out fighting on its
behalf, supported by Belgian Governing Council Guy Quaden.
 ""I am more than confident in the future of the euro,""
Trichet told France's radio one. 
 When asked whether the euro would survive the current
problems, Quaden replied: ""Without a doubt.""
 The euro has plunged around 11 percent since mid-January on
both the ECB's favoured trade-weighted basis  and
against the dollar  as the crisis has gained traction.
 Quaden rebuffed talk of countries leaving the currency union
in the wake of the problems.
 ""Firstly, that is not foreseen in the treaty. Secondly, no
country has an interest in leaving the euro. Neither Greece nor
Germany,"" he told a Belgian magazine.
 
 BOND BUYING
 As part of the $1 trillion package to prop up the euro and
its debt-ridden members, the ECB abandoned a long-held principle
this week and announced it would start buying government debt.
 Details of the ECB's bond buying plan remain vague. There is
still no hint of how much the ECB is prepared to spend, what
maturities it will target, if it has specific aims for yields or
how long it expects the process to take.
 Speaking to German radio station Deutschlandfunk, ECB
policymaker Juergen Stark said the bank would keep hold of the
bonds it buys. 
 ""The government bonds which we're buying today will be held
until the end of their maturity,"" he said.
 He also reiterated that it would also neutralise the
inflationary potential of the move by gouging money out of the
system elsewhere, a process known as 'sterilisation'.
 ""We will mop up this extra liquidity again. We've done this
in the past,"" he said.
 Traders said euro zone central banks, who are doing the
buying on ECB's behalf, were back in the market buying bonds on
Wednesday [ID:nMAT012339].
 Trichet refused to comment on the amount of bonds the ECB
was prepared to buy.
 
 POLITCAL PRESSURE
 Trichet also hit out at suggestions that the ECB had binned
its inflation-fighting principles with the move.
 ""We have not changed our monetary policy. All liquidity
which being put in through these interventions will be taken
back. We are not running money printing presses.""
 Stark insisted the ECB would resist any political pressure
to allow higher euro zone inflation as a way of tackling
governments' debt problems.
 He denied there had been any political influence in the
ECB's decision to reverse its previous opposition to government
bond purchases, and said the central bank would have rejected
this if there had been any.
 ""On the ECB board, we are a very convinced band who will
resist political pressure,"" he said. ""However, increased
political pressure could come from other areas of the world so
that globally, central banks could have difficulties.""

1272,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2010 05:04AM ET</span>","Italy Q1 GDP jumps 0.5 pct, well above forecasts"," ROME, May 12 (Reuters) - Italy's economy grew significantly
more than expected in the first quarter, with gross domestic
product up 0.5 percent from the previous three months, the
strongest gain since the fourth quarter of 2006.
 On an annual basis, GDP was up 0.6 percent after a 2.8
percent drop at the end of 2009, the first year-on-year rise
since the first quarter of 2008, data showed on Wednesday.
 A Reuters survey of 24 analysts had pointed to a quarterly
increase of 0.3 percent and a flat year-on-year reading.
 Official statistics agency ISTAT also revised up the fourth
quarter of 2009 to show a marginal quarterly contraction of 0.1
percent compared with a previous estimate of -0.3 percent.
 Analysts welcomed the stronger than expected figures but
said they did not expect Italy to maintain the same momentum.
 ""Italian GDP figures ... are very volatile and after the
fall in Q4, I was expected an upward bounce,"" said Gilles Moec
of Deutsche Bank.
 ""We may see a bit of a backlash in the second quarter. The
strong rise in Q1 seems to have involved a bit of inventory
rebuilding.""
 Moec forecast growth would slow to 0.4 percent in Q2, 0.3
percent in Q3 and 0.2 percent in Q4, for an overall increase in
2010 of 0.9 percent, broadly in line with the government's 1.0
percent target.
 Davide Stroppa of Citigroup was far less upbeat, saying he
expected growth of just 0.5 percent over the full year.
 Italy's data follows GDP releases on Wednesday in the other
large euro zone countries.
 Germany posted a 0.2 percent quarterly rise, beating a
median forecast of a flat reading, while France rose 0.1
percent, against a forecast of +0.3 percent.

 * Rostowski says 2015 entry still possible but no hurry
 
 (Adds more quotes, background)
 WARSAW, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro zone, hammered by
financial markets over the debt woes of some member states,
needs time to ""refurbish"" and Poland is in no rush to join,
Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said on Wednesday.
 His comments echoed those of Prime Minister Donald Tusk who
signalled last week that the European Union's largest
ex-communist economy had put its ambitious euro plans on hold
for now and was cautiously monitoring the debt crisis.
 ""The euro zone is now like a house that needs some work,
repainting and refurbishing,"" Rostowski told Radio Zet.
 ""As with all such works, there is some noise and dust, so
it's maybe better that we are in our own little house and in a
few years, when the euro zone is refurbished, we move there.""
 Tusk's centrist government insists euro adoption remains a
strategic objective but has not set an official new target date
after the global financial crisis last year forced it to drop
its 2012 goal for swapping zlotys for euros.
 Analysts and some officials say 2015 is now the earliest
possible date for Poland to join the euro zone.
""2015 is a possible year, but for a long time we have been
saying we are not in a hurry to join the euro,"" Rostowski said.
 Poland was the only EU member state to avoid recession last
year but a sharp slowdown in growth has driven its budget
deficit higher and analysts say Warsaw faces a tough battle
reducing it to a level that meets euro membership criteria.
 Poland also faces hurdles in parliament to euro adoption,
with the right-wing main opposition Law and Justice party (PiS)
opposed to amending the constitution to allow for adoption of
the common currency.
 PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski is now a candidate for
Poland's presidential election, set for June 20, after the death
of incumbent Lech Kaczynski, his twin brother, in a plane crash.
Kaczynski would further hamper Tusk's euro plans if elected.
 Asked if he feared Kaczynski's win in the election,
Rostowski said: ""Yes, I am afraid of the legislative paralysis
that we have been seeing over the last two-and-a-half years.""
 ""We managed to weather the (financial) crisis with our
partners at the central bank, but we must not delude ourselves.
We will be seeing similar, maybe less strong but maybe even
stronger problems over the next, let's say, six months, and we
cannot afford such paralysis in this situation.""
 Lech Kaczynski used his veto to block key government reforms
and his brother is expected to do likewise if elected. Opinion
polls place him second after Bronislaw Komorowski, the candidate
of Tusk's ruling pro-euro, pro-business Civic Platform (PO).

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - European shares climbed close to
1 percent and the euro strengthened on Wednesday on evidence of
continued German growth and Spain's plans to cut its deficit.
 Wall Street also looked set to open higher as investors
continued to adjust their positions following the European
Union's sovereign debt rescue plan.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was up 0.3 percent, led
by Europe, where the FTSEurofirst 300 gained 0.1 percent gain
after starting slightly lower.
 World shares gained nearly 5 percent on Monday after the EU
and the International Monetary Fund agreed a 750 billion euro
rescue package to stop Greece's debt crisis spilling over into
other economies. Markets slipped back a bit on Tuesday.
 The plan has drawn a line under the worst fears about a
spread of the euro zone debt crisis, leaving investors to look
at what countries are doing to improve their finances.
 ""(It) is likely to shift markets' attention to the actual
implementation of the promised fiscal reforms and economic
performance in response to them,"" Barclays Capital said in a
note.
 ""If these disappoint, the very positive market reaction of
recent days may not last.""
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on
Wednesday announced public spending cuts of 6 billion euros and
said civil servant wages would be slashed by 5 percent this year
as part of a drive to meet EU deficit targets.
 The measures are designed to bring the country's budget
deficit to 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 11.2
percent in 2009.
 
 EURO FIRMS
 The euro climbed 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.2688.
 Earlier the currency had weakened with some investors
concerned that the EU rescue plan does not solve the fundamental
issues facing the bloc's finances.
 On fixed income markets, the premium investors demand to
hold 10-year Greek government bonds rather than euro zone
benchmark German Bunds fell.
 The 10-year Greek/German government bond yield spread
narrowed to 465 basis points.
 Germany's GDP grew for the fourth quarter in a row in the
first three months of 2010, data showed on Wednesday.
 ""We have heard of more central bank buying of debt, in
accordance with the European rescue deal struck (at the weekend)
to help peripheral issues,"" a trader in London said.
 On Monday, Greek/German bond yield spreads shrank from more
than 1,000 bps to around 500 bps.

 By John Acher and Peter Levring
 COPENHAGEN, May 12 (Reuters) - Shipping and oil group A.P.
Moller-Maersk raised 2010 profit guidance after a
forecast-beating first quarter driven by recovering freight
rates and higher oil prices, boosting its shares sharply.
 ""2010 started better than expected and overall expectations
for the A.P. Moller-Maersk group are thus a profit for 2010 --
an improvement compared to the previous statement on March 4 of
a modest profit,"" the Danish company said on Wednesday.
 Maersk's stock was up 7.9 percent by 1014 GMT, outperforming
a 2.0 percent rise in Copenhagen's OMXC20 index.
 Profit before financial items more than doubled to 11.2
billion Danish crowns ($1.9 billion) in the three months to the
end of March, beating forecasts in a 5.56-10.37 billion range in
a Reuters poll in which the average estimate was 8.23 billion.
 ""Very strong results, no doubt about it,"" said ING analyst
Axel Funhoff. ""Pretty strong across the board but the key
surprise really came out of the container shipping division.""
 Container shipping swung back into profit from a year-ago
loss. In March, the group said its container business, where its
Maersk Line is world leader, would post another loss this year.
 ""The group's container shipping and related activities are
now expecting a positive result for 2010 based on the improved
market conditions for the container shipping activities,"" the
company said on Wednesday.
 Chief executive Nils Smedegaard Andersen told Reuters in an
interview the development in freight rates had improved
significantly from three months ago, but he cautioned against
expecting the first-quarter trend to last all year.
 ""We believe that what continues to drive this is restocking,
so one should beware of thinking that this will develop at the
same speed for the rest of the year,"" Andersen said.
 The main driver in the container business was an 18 percent
rise in freight rates from a year ago, he told analysts in a
conference call. ""Rates have recovered faster than we expected
just a few months ago,"" Andersen said, but added that rates had
not recovered to the 2008 level.
 ""We expect that (container shipping) rates will continue to
go up from the first quarter, and that is also necessary to
deliver a positive result,"" he said.
 First-quarter tanker rates remained below year-ago levels.
 
 ""OUT OF THE WOODS""
 Shipping markets have recovered from a deep plunge in 2009
when Maersk suffered its first annual loss.
 Maersk's container shipping arm swung to a first-quarter
operating profit of 1.26 billion crowns from a 2.61 billion loss
in the 2009 period and with analyst expecting another loss.
 ""Maersk Line seems to be well on track to really perform
better than people had originally expected,"" ING's Funhoff said.
""You can even say that division is out of the woods.""
 The bulk of group earnings still came from the oil and gas
business where operating profits rose to 8.1 billion crowns in
the first quarter from 5.43 billion a year earlier, exceeding
analysts' average estimate.
 Andersen said higher oil prices were the sole reason for the
higher oil and gas profits as output fell to 35 million barrels
of oil equivalents in the quarter from 43 million a year ago.
 Maersk forecast that its 2010 oil and gas production on an
entitlement basis would be ""somewhat below"" that of 2009,
primarily due to a lower share of production from its Qatar
assets, and slightly below the first quarter in 2010.
 Maersk, with a fleet of 539 container vessels and sometimes
seen as a barometer of world trade, said there was still
uncertainty about how freight volumes and rates would develop.
 ""Global cargo volumes for 2010 are expected to rise by
minimum 5 percent, driven mainly by the strong development
in demand in the first quarter,"" Maersk said.
 Andersen told Reuters Maersk was monitoring the Greek crisis
for any impact on European consumption -- a key driver of
container shipping which is largely transport of consumer goods.
 Andersen said that the focus of Maersk investments will
remains on oil and gas and its port terminal business.

 * Sterling steady vs euro, dollar as investors await detail

 By Fiona Shaikh and Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Britain's financial markets
welcomed Britain's new Conservative and Liberal Democrat
coalition government on Wednesday but enthusiasm was contained
as investors waited for more detail on policy.
 Gordon Brown resigned as prime minister late on Tuesday,
bringing to a close 13 years of Labour rule, and was replaced by
Conservative leader David Cameron, whose party won the most
seats in last week's inconclusive election. 
 Cameron will lead Britain's first coalition government since
1945 with Lib Dem party leader Nick Clegg as his deputy and the
Conservative's George Osborne as finance minister.
 Gilt futures jumped half a point in early trade and
outperformed their euro zone counterparts as investors hoped the
new administration would take swift action to reduce Britain's
record budget deficit.
 Sterling had enjoyed a strong performance overnight but
relinquished some ground to trade broadly steady against the
dollar and euro at $1.4950  and 84.60 pence 
respectively.
 ""Yesterday's relief rally has petered out but I do expect
the new government to take quick action on spending cuts which
should keep the ratings agencies on side,"" said Kenneth Broux,
market economist at Lloyds Banking Group. 
 The coalition is expected to implement Conservative plans to
cut six billion pounds of spending this financial year, earlier
than Labour or the Lib Dems, had campaigned for. [ID:nLDE64B072]
 At 0756, the June gilt future  was 26 ticks up at
116.84, off a session high of 117.08 struck shortly after the
open, but still outperforming the equivalent Bund by more than
30 ticks.
 In the cash market, the yield on ten-year gilts fell 4 basis
points to 3.863 percent, narrowing the spread between 10-year
gilt and Bund yields -- a barometer of investor sentiment -- to
91 basis points from around 96 on Tuesday.
 The internationally focused FTSE 100 <.FTSE> was up 0.4
percent, underperforming greater gains for the pan European
FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>. 
 But the more domestically exposed FTSE 250 <.FTMC> gained
1.2 percent, with analysts saying political developments were
supportive.
 ""A Conservative-led government would tend to favour small
and medium sized companies because of their domestic orientation
as it is likely to be supportive of the pound,"" said Jim Wood
Smith, head of research at Williams de Broe.
 
 DEVIL IN THE DETAIL
 Cameron's succession removed some of the uncertainty that
drove sterling to a 13-month low against the dollar last week
after an inconclusive election gave no party an absolute
majority in parliament. [ID:nLDE6492UW]
 Analysts said investors were now waiting for more detail on
the new administration's debt cutting plans.
 The Conservatives had pledged in their election manifesto to
hold an emergency budget within 50 days of entering office.
 The dire state of the UK's public finances, with a budget
deficit of over 11 percent of GDP, has been a cause of concern
for ratings agencies, with investors sensitive to the potential
for a downgrade of the UK's sovereign rating which would hamper
efforts to pay off the deficit.
 ""If they manage to put through the austerity measures, you
can presume the triple-A rating is pretty safe,"" said Charles
Diebel, strategist at Nomura. ""But that's a slow burn. It's cold
hard facts we're waiting for now.""
 The next focus for investors will be UK unemployment data
due at 0830 GMT, and the Bank of England's quarterly Inflation
Report at 0930 GMT.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro remained under pressure
on Wednesday on worries about the euro zone's ability to tackle
its debt crisis, while sterling turned lower against the dollar
after a new coalition UK government was formed.
 An initial relief rally after a $1 trillion emergency aid
package was announced on Monday to prevent the spread of a euro
zone debt crisis dissipated and focus switched back to
structural problems plaguing the bloc.
 ""Uncertainty continues to rule the roost for the single
currency and there is no sign of this ending anytime soon,"" said
Stuart Bennett, currency strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
 A pullback in risk appetite was compounded after the Wall
Street Journal reported U.S. federal investigators are probing
whether Morgan Stanley  misled investors about
mortgage-derivative products it helped design and sometimes bet
against.
 At 0809 GMT, the euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.2635,
having retreated from Monday's high near $1.3100. Initial
support was seen around $1.2580, near Friday's lows.
 In one potentially supportive factor, traders cited talk of
a double no-touch option position in the euro with barriers at
$1.25 and $1.31. Such a position suggests that the holder would
buy euros on any drop towards $1.25 to defend that position
until it expires.
 Others cited barriers at $1.26, and big stop-loss sales
below $1.2580.
 
 STERLING FALTERS
 Against the yen, the euro was also down 0.1 percent at
117.14 yen, having fallen from above 122 yen touched earlier
this week.
 The euro remains on a downtrend versus the yen after its
21-day moving average slipped below the 65-day moving average on
Tuesday, forming a so-called ""death cross"", a bearish sign, Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ FX analysts said in a note.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
reiterated on Wednesday the central bank's stance to sterilise,
or drain excess liquidity from its government bond buying.
 ""All liquidity which is being put in through these
interventions will be taken back. We are not running money
printing presses,"" he said on French radio.
 The dollar was flat on the day at 92.67 yen .
 ""The WSJ report prompted investors to reduce risks and there
is a mood that players are looking for negative factors now,"" an
FX trader at a Japanese trust bank said.
 Sterling slipped back from highs hit the previous day after
Conservative leader David Cameron became Britain's new prime
minister on Tuesday after securing a power-sharing agreement
between his centre-right party and the smaller Liberal
Democrats. 
 They plan to stick to the Conservatives' line of taking
immediate steps to reduce the budget deficit, seen rising to
more than 11 percent of GDP this year, by cutting 6 billion
pounds in non-frontline services this year. But there was
uncertainty in the market about the new government's overall
deficit reduction plans.
 Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.4918  after
rising above $1.5000 on Tuesday. The euro edged up 0.2 percent
against sterling to 84.78 pence after falling 1.6 percent on
Tuesday.
 Markets will also eye the Bank of England's quarterly
inflation report due out on Wednesday.

 By Cheon Jong-woo and Yoo Choonsik
 SEOUL, May 12 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank
signalled on Wednesday it was getting ready to start raising
interest rates, bringing forward expectations of a hike to the
third quarter and dragging bond prices down.
 After a policy meeting, the Bank of Korea pledged to
maintain an easier stance but dropped a long-held reference to
'for the time being', which was interpreted as signalling that
rates would stay on hold for a shorter period than previously
believed.
 The central bank expectedly maintained the key 7-day
repurchase agreement rate at a record low 2.0 percent for a
15th consecutive month, but the dropping of the key phrase
caused a mild flutter.
 ""When there was the expression, the general consensus was
that the Bank of Korea will be maintaining policy for one or
two quarters,"" said Kong Dong-rak at Taurus Investment &
Securities. ""Without it, the nuance is that the period will be
much shorter than that.""
 Asked by reporters why he had not used the expression,
Governor Kim Choong-soo said: ""It had to be removed at some
point. When to remove it was what mattered.""
 The scholar-turned diplomat and former presidential aide
was also more upbeat on growth prospects while playing down the
local fallout from the euro zone's debt crisis, all of which
fed into hardening expectations of a third quarter hike.
 ""Quite a lot of variables showed improvement,"" said Kim,
who took office last month and was widely seen as being
responsive to the government's efforts to keep rates low. ""The
domestic economy's pace of recovery has become more visible.""
 In a Reuters poll after the central bank comments, 11 out
of 14 analysts predicted interest rates would be raised next
month or in the third quarter.
 In a poll earlier this week, only 12 of 22 analysts had
forecast a rise in the benchmark interest rate before October.
Three of those predicting a fourth-quarter move now expect a
rate rise in the third quarter.
 SURPRISE COMMENTS
 Kim also said a global economic recovery was driving the
country's exports sharply higher and that domestic capital
spending and private consumption were steadily increasing.
 ""It is quite surprising to the market that the new
governor, who was often portrayed as dovish and pro-government,
has turned more hawkish in his second monetary policy meeting,""
said Sharon Lam at Morgan Stanley in a note to investors.
 ""It is even more surprising that this happens at a time
when external uncertainties rise. I am, however, glad to see
such a change as I think the central bank is getting it right
to set pre-emptive policy and to acknowledge the gap between
interest rates and growth.""
 Bond prices fell across the board, with the benchmark
5-year treasury yield jumping 10 basis points to 4.46 percent.
The 3-year treasury bond futures June contract fell 43 ticks to
111.10, the biggest daily fall in seven weeks.
 ""The removal of the reference to 'for the time being'
caught my eye because it suggests that the Bank of Korea may
now opt to raise interest rates at any time in the future
depending on the situation,"" said Kim Jae-eun, an economist at
Hyundai Securities.
 ""But overall, I don't think the governor's comments
indicated the timing of tightening will be sooner than the
market's expectations,"" she added.
 Many analysts have said the Bank of Korea is already behind
the curve because Asia's fourth-largest economy has been
recovering much ahead of expectations and would risk a
household credit bubble by delaying monetary tightening for too
long.
 Government data released earlier in the day showed South
Korea added the most jobs in nearly five years in April over a
year earlier as brisk exports mainly to emerging economies
required more workers.
 Kim said the employment data was encouraging, while
President Lee Myung-bak was quoted by his spokesman as saying
that the April employment data was ""very hopeful"".
 South Korean inflation of 2.6 percent is below the middle
of the central bank's 2-4 percent target.
 The central bank slashed the policy rate by a total of 3.25
percentage points between October 2008 and February 2009 to
shield the domestic economy from the fallout of the global
financial crisis.
 It will next review the interest rate on June 10.

Board member Juergen Stark said on Wednesday that central banks
worldwide are likely to come under increasing political

 ""On the ECB board, we are a very convinced band which will

""However, increased political pressure could come from other

 Stark also denied there had been any political influence in
the ECB's decision to reverse its opposition to government bond
purchases and said it would have rejected this if there had
been any.
 Stark repeated ECB promises to sterilise money put into the
economy during its programme of buying euro zone government
bonds which began on Monday.
 The euro zone would have higher inflation this year but
price stability would still be achieved in the bloc, he said.
He also saw no inflation risk for the foreseeable future.

 More worrisome than the 2.8 percent rise in consumer prices

 Li is one of three academic advisers to the People's Bank of

but little influence over policy decisions.
 A professor at Qinghua University, Li has been relatively
hawkish since his appointment as an adviser earlier this year,
repeatedly saying that the central bank should consider raising
interest rates.
 In his latest comments, Li said that it was important for the
central bank to stabilise savers' and investors' expectations by
breaking the trend towards negative real rates.
 The benchmark one-year deposit rate is currently 2.25

 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Wednesday on
nagging worries about the euro zone's ability to tackle its debt
crisis, while sterling trimmed gains made against the dollar
after a new coalition UK government was formed.
 The euro remained under selling pressure with investors still
sceptical about whether the euro zone economies could deliver the
drastic spending cuts and tax increases needed to get their
fiscal houses in order.
 Sterling slipped back from highs hit the previous day after
Conservative leader David Cameron became Britain's new prime
minister.
 ""It will take time to solve the fundamental problem of fiscal
debt in the euro zone. And the euro is expected to be weighed
down although some will probably buy on dips as short positions
in the currency have accumulated,"" said Mitsuru Sahara, chief
manager at the currency derivatives trading department at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""The market will continue to watch the degree of commitment
of central banks in the euro zone economies and authorities such
as the IMF to the debt problem in the area,"" he said.
 The euro was trading around $1.2642, down 0.2 percent from
late U.S. trade on Tuesday, having retreated from Monday's high
near $1.3100. One near-term downside target for the euro may be
around $1.2580, near Friday's low, said a trader at a Japanese
bank.
 In one potentially supportive factor, traders cited talk of a
double no-touch option position in the euro with barriers at
$1.25 and $1.31. Such a position suggests that the holder would
buy euros on any drop towards $1.25 to defend that position until
it expires.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.1 percent at 117.30 yen,
having fallen from above 122 yen touched earlier this week.
 Euro/yen remains on a downtrend after its 21-day moving
average slipped below the 65-day moving average on Tuesday,
forming a so-called ""death cross"", a bearish sign, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ FX analysts said in a note.
 ""The recent market is driven by political factors surrounding
the euro and ups and downs of market tension, rather than
economic indicators. It is hard to predict what will come next,
making it difficult for traders to take risks,"" said Satoshi
Okagawa, head of the forex and money trading group at Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking in Singapore.
 On the political front, Conservative party leader David
Cameron took over as British prime minister after securing a
power-sharing agreement between his centre-right party and the
smaller Liberal Democrats.
 Market players said they were keen to see if the
Conservative-led government will take swift action to bring down
spending.
 Sterling slipped 0.1 percent to $1.4902 after rising above
$1.5000 on Tuesday. The euro edged up 0.2 percent against
sterling to 84.80 pence after falling 1.6 percent on Tuesday.
 A drop below 84.28 pence would take the euro to its lowest in
11 months against sterling.

 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - Japan is not on its way to becoming
the next Greece, but the country's finance ministry is looking at
extending the average maturity of its debt to reduce future
refunding risks, a senior ministry official said.
 Greece's debt woes have highlighted fiscal problems in Japan
and some market players worry Japan could face growing difficulty
in borrowing as its debt, the highest among industrialised
countries, is soaring. Its public debt is about 200 percent of
GDP, far above Greece's 120 percent.
 The cost of insuring Japanese debt against default for five
years hit a one-year high above 90 basis points last week as
worries about public debt engulfed global financial markets.
 But Masaaki Kaizuka, director of debt management for the
ministry, shrugged off the comparison with Greece, saying Japan's
debt is mostly domestically financed based on huge savings in the
corporate sector and by households.
 ""Japan's problems are different in terms of the quality of
its debt. It is not logical to think Japan could be the next
Greece,"" he told a seminar.
 But Kaizuka also said the government may extend the average
maturity of its debt -- now seven and a half years -- as much as
possible during the current fiscal year to March.
 ""I guess the Greek debt crisis has brought home to
authorities the need to reduce the country's refunding needs,""
said Hidenori Suezawa, chief strategist at Nikko Cordial
Securities.
 ""The government will gradually increase sales of 30-year and
40-year bonds, which seem to have met with good demand for now,""
he said.
 SUPER-LONG BONDS
 The ministry is due to issue 144.3 trillion yen ($1.6
trillion) in JGBs to institutional investors through regular
auctions this fiscal year, a 5 percent rise from last fiscal
year's issuance.
 Of that total, only 1.2 trillion yen is earmarked for 40-year
bonds and 4.8 trillion yen for 30-year bonds. Analysts believe
long-term investors such as pension funds and life insurers may
want to buy more of those super-long bonds.
The government bond market showed muted response to Kaizuka's
comments, traders said. Current 30-year government bonds were
untraded on Wednesday.
 Kaizuka said the ministry was forced to rely more on
short-term debt last year because of successive government
stimulus measures. But this fiscal year it is putting more
emphasis on the super-long sector.
 ""We will be flexible about our bond issuance plan, as we were
in the previous year,"" Kaizuka said.
 Debt problems in Greece and other euro zone countries have
triggered downgrades by ratings agencies and shaken financial
markets. The rating firms have also threatened to cut Japan's
sovereign ratings if it fails to show a strong commitment to
cutting debt in a mid-term fiscal plan expected next month.
 Japan's five-year credit default swap (CDS) was quoted at
76-81 basis points on Wednesday, below a record high of 130 basis
points set in February 2009 during the global financial crisis
and lower than about 560 basis points for Greek debt on Tuesday.
 But the net notional volume of Japan sovereign CDS, or
aggregate amount of money that would change hands in the event of
a default, has been increasing, a trader at a foreign bank said.
 ""Overseas players are buying Japan sovereign CDS along with
other sovereign CDSs as the ratio of Japan's public debt against
its GDP is very high,"" the trader said.
 Many market players suspect Japanese government bond yields
could rise as the country's savings could dwindle due to the
rapid ageing of its population.
 Kaizuka acknowledged such concerns.
 ""We need to recognise that the environment will eventually
change. There may come a time when we would need to rely more on
foreign investors,"" he said.
 The ministry is trying to boost communication with overseas
investors prevent risk premiums on JGBs from rising, he also
said.

 * Finmin sees Q1 GDP growth at 9 pct
 * Hopes to widen trade and investment ties with China
(Adds background, comments, writes through)
 By Lee Chyen Yee and Lucy Hornby
 BEIJING, May 12 (Reuters) - Thailand's finance minister
gave a slightly improved outlook for Southeast Asia's
second-largest economy on Wednesday, saying a swift end to the
Thai political crisis will be instrumental in ensuring growth
stays on track.
 Anti-government protesters, called the ""red shirts"", have
massed in the Thai capital Bangkok over the past two months,
crippling the government and worrying foreign investors.
 The International Crisis Group warned earlier this month
that Thailand faces an ""undeclared civil war"", but Finance
Minister Korn Chatikavanij told Reuters policies such as better
access to education and income guarantees for farmers could
help reduce the inequalities fuelling unrest.
 ""Civil war is a big word, and we're a long way from that.
But having said that, the conflict that exists is real,"" Korn
said in an interview in Beijing.
 ""I am quite sure that an ongoing commitment to these kinds
of policies will help in reducing the differences and reducing
the level of tension in our society in such a way as to avoid
the worst-case Armageddon that's been talked about,"" he said,
adding record-low interest rates would likely rise when the
crisis ends.
 The protesters vowed to stay on despite the army chief's
threat to use force and Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's
warning that they must end the rally by Wednesday.
 Korn, whose comments came before the Thai army and
Abhisit's warnings, offered a slightly improved outlook for
2010 GDP, projecting economic growth of 4.5 to 5 percent, in
line with pre-crisis estimates. On April 30, he said the crisis
had already cut economic growth by half a percentage point but
on Wednesday he said it could shave 0.3 of a percentage point
off the target.
 Thailand's first quarter GDP is expected to have grown by 9
percent from a year ago, said Korn.
 TOURISM HIT
 Tourism, which makes up over 6 percent of Thailand's $260
billion economy, has been hit by the protests, although Korn
said he hoped bookings would recover before the peak Christmas
season.
 ""The protests have pretty much really only affected
Bangkok, and only the centre of Bangkok, but there is a general
sense of unease,"" Korn said.
 Korn said that once the political crisis is resolved, he
expected the central bank to raise the main policy rate, which
has been kept at a record low of 1.25 percent for about a year.
 He did not offer a timeframe, but the next rate-setting
meeting is scheduled for June 2.
 ""Once there is a resolution on the political front, I would
be surprised if they didn't begin to tighten rates,"" said Korn,
an Oxford graduate.
 Despite the protests, the Thai baht has been
well-supported, firming about 3 percent since the beginning of
the year due to overall strength in Asian currencies, Korn
said.
 Korn was in Beijing to meet Chinese counterpart Xie Xuren
and banking regulator Liu Mingkang, after completing the sale
of his ministry's stake in Thai lender ACL Bank to China's ICBC
as part of a $550 million takeover.
 Korn urged Liu to allow Chinese banks to invest in
Thailand's stock market. Firms such as Thailand's Banpu are
also eyeing opportunities in Inner Mongolia's power sector.
 ""We need ... to put our house in order,"" Korn said. ""Once
that's done, I don't think we will have a problem in explaining
and regaining the level of confidence amongst foreign
investors.""

 * Sterling holds gains, market eyes new govt's moves on debt
 * Advances in stocks help higher yielders vs yen.
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, May 12 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Wednesday on
nagging worries about the euro zone's ability to tackle its debt
crisis, while sterling held gains after a new coalition UK
government was formed.
 Conservative party leader David Cameron took over as British
prime minister after securing a power-sharing agreement between
his centre-right party and the smaller Liberal Democrats.
 Market players said they were keen to see if the
Conservative-led government will take swift action to bring down
spending.
 The euro remained under selling pressure with investors still
sceptical about the euro zone economies' ability to deliver the
drastic spending cuts and tax increases needed to get their
fiscal houses in order.
 ""The euro's gains were short-lived as the fundamental debt
problems in Greece and some other nations in the euro-zone have
not been solved and severe conditions will likely continue,"" said
a trader at a Japanese bank.
 ""Investors cannot become optimistic and they are not yet
ready to fully take on risk trades,"" he said.
 The euro was trading around $1.2636, down 0.2 percent from
late U.S. trade on Tuesday, having retreated from Monday's high
near $1.3100. One near-term downside target for the euro may be
around $1.2580, near Friday's low, the trader said.
 Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.4888 after rising above
$1.5000 on Tuesday. The euro edged up 0.2 percent against
sterling to 84.84 pence after falling more than 1.5 percent on
Tuesday.
 A drop below 84.28 pence would take the euro to its lowest in
11 months against sterling.
 Initial gains in Tokyo shares helped higher-yielding
currencies against the yen with the Australian dollar rising 0.2
percent to 83.13 yen.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 92.86 yen.

 * Tough IMF medicine could lead to lower valuations
 By John McCrank
 TORONTO, May 11 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone
Group LP  has seen little reason to do deals in pricey
Europe, but the current environment might make things ""more
interesting,"" its chief executive said on Tuesday.
 ""We were not interested (in Europe) when prices were very
high, growth was very low and a lot of people other than us had
a lot of enthusiasm,"" CEO Stephen Schwarzman said in a speech
to the Economic Club of Canada in Toronto.
 But a $1 trillion emergency aid package to stabilize the
euro and prevent the spread of a sovereign debt crisis in
Europe may lead to changes that make deals more likely going
forward, he said.
 ""For a lot of this money to be disbursed and so forth, it's
basically under the aegis of IMF (International Monetary Fund)
plans, which tend to be pretty strong medicine, and that strong
medicine that may need to be taken by a variety of countries in
the EU almost logically would inhibit growth in some way,""
Schwarzman said.
 ""As an investor in our asset classes, that is a potentially
interesting thing ... What I have found in life is that when
the environment changes and people recognize that there are
issues, that valuations over time tend to drift down, which
might make it more interesting for us.""
 Schwarzman said that he likes ""China, India, and everything
that touches them"" for future growth.
 He added that, overall, the prospects for the U.S. economy
are ""surprisingly good,"" with a ""U"" type recovery apparently
shaping up.
 IPO MARKET RESPONSIVE
 The ability for private equity firms to carry off large
buyouts is returning. Blackstone, with two other private equity
firms, is in talks to buy Fidelity National Information
Services Inc  , sources familiar with the
situation have told Reuters.
 Blackstone, one of the biggest buyout companies in the
world, with investments in Hilton hotels, Freescale
semiconductors and SeaWorld theme parks, also has a number of
companies in various stages of the initial public offering
process. [ID:nLDE64A0M3]
 For the second half of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010,
it completed or has in process about 12 ""realizations"", when a
company exits an investment by IPOs and subsequent secondary
sales, dividend recapitalization or by a strategic sale.
 The market for leveraged buyout-backed initial public
offerings can be streaky, but right now the market is
responsive, Schwarzman said.
 IPOs from his firm have outperformed comparable company
offerings by about 48 percent, he said.
 He added that, absent the last two or three weeks,
strategic sales have also been ""pretty good.""
 ""We've done a number of them,"" he said.
 ""In terms of dividend recaps, both the return of bank
lending as well as the most active junk bond market in history
in the first quarter of 2010 has made it more possible to do
transactions of that type.""
 Blackstone reported higher than expected quarterly earnings
in April as the value of its investments continued to rebound.

 * EU ready to begin talks ""immediately"" with US
 * Wants ""no preconditions"" on aid for Airbus A350
 * US, EU also discuss Doha round, bilateral trade forum
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - The European Union is ready
to begin talks with the United States to end a long-running
dispute over support for rival aircraft makers Boeing Co 
and Airbus , a top EU trade official said on Tuesday.
 EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told reporters the
bloc could start negotiations ""immediately,"" as long as there
were ""no preconditions"" on future European government aid for
Airbus's new A350 plane.
 ""But it is obvious once you have those negotiations, that
the whole package should also be on the table. You will not be
able to avoid negotiations also on that,"" De Gucht said.
 Asked after meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Ron
Kirk and White House deputy national security adviser Michael
Froman if he expected such talks to begin, De Gucht said ""we'll
have to see in the coming weeks.""
 U.S. trade officials said they stood ready to discuss an
agreement with the EU and relevant member states. ""But any
productive discussions must necessarily address all
WTO-inconsistent subsidies to civil aircraft,"" USTR spokeswoman
Nefeterius McPherson said.
 A World Trade Organization panel called on European
governments in March to end illegal subsidies for Airbus in a
case filed years ago by the United States, according to sources
familiar with the confidential ruling.
 Airbus has argued that the decision should not affect the
A350 since it was not covered in the U.S. complaint. But
Washington believes the ruling should set a precedent for
Airbus projects launched after it filed its case.
 COUNTERSUIT
 A second panel is expected to release its preliminary
ruling by late June in a countersuit brought by the EU over
U.S. support for Boeing.
 It has been widely assumed that serious negotiations to
resolve the dispute would not begin until that ruling was
released, and both sides could see how much damage had been
inflicted on U.S. support programs for Boeing.
 ""We believe there should be negotiations without
preconditions. So as far as we are concerned the negotiations
could also start immediately because (insisting) that we have
to wait for the outcome of the panel would itself be a
precondition,"" De Gucht said.
 ""The real question is can you develop a large aircraft
without subsidies ... I think Airbus can't and Boeing can't and
that's where you should come to a mutual understanding what is
acceptable and what is not acceptable.""
 De Gucht also discussed with U.S. officials prospects for
concluding the Doha round of world trade talks and the EU's
interest in revitalizing a bilateral forum known as the
Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC).
 He acknowledged the current Doha package is not politically
saleable in the United States. But the only solution is to try
to improve it, since it is unrealistic to think negotiators
could start from scratch on a new deal, De Gucht said.
 A date for the next TEC meeting will be set when the two
sides agree on a short list of products or sectors where they
can boost trade by reducing regulatory barriers, he said.
 De Gucht was vague on further details, but said the two
sides should concentrate work on emerging sectors where there
is less regulatory conflict before tackling older areas.

 By Jennifer Kwan and Jeffrey Hodgson
 TORONTO, May 11 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar firmed on
Tuesday, hitting an eight-year high against a struggling euro,
as the country's strong fundamentals relative its Western peers
helped spur investor interest.
 While no major Canadian economic data was released on
Tuesday, analysts said doubts about whether a massive emergency
aid package can solve Europe's debt crisis in the long run was
enough to push the Canadian currency higher.
 ""In terms of Canada, risk aversion has decreased. Canada
ranks very well on sovereign issues, fundamental issues, the
major drivers are still very strong,"" said Camilla Sutton,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 The Canadian currency  touched a high of C$1.0149
to the U.S. dollar, or 98.53 U.S. cents, its strongest level
against the greenback since May 4.
 The currency finished at C$1.0218, or 97.87 U.S. cents, up
from C$1.0243 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.63 U.S. cents, at
Monday's close. It soared almost 2 percent against its U.S.
counterpart on Monday.
 Its move against the euro was even more dramatic, with the
Canadian dollar rising as high as C$1.2922, or 77.39 euro
cents, its strongest level since July 2001.
 The euro stumbled as investors had second thoughts about
the $1 trillion ""shock and awe"" emergency aid package recently
announced by European authorities. [MKTS/GLOB] [FRX/]
 ""You've got Canada that is definitely on the upswing as
illustrated by our employment numbers, our solid banking
system, our relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio. You've got the
euro zone that is being anchored down by ... Greece, Portugal,
Ireland, Italy and Spain,"" said Firas Askari, head of foreign
exchange trading at BMO Capital Markets.
 ""The market is still reluctant to buy euro, is still
reluctant to view this as a cure-all, so people are divesting
out of euro, so a lot of them are picking up the Canadian
dollar.""
 The currency was also supported by firmness in North
American equity markets, with Toronto stocks higher in part on
strong bullion prices. [.TO]
 Brendan McGrath, a foreign exchange trader at Custom House,
noted the Canadian dollar also moved past a previous support
level of C$1.02 to the U.S. dollar, which sparked further
strength.
 ""If stocks continue to perform well and commodities
continue to perform well then we can expect the Canadian dollar
to strengthen on the back of that,"" he said.
 BOND PRICES FLAT TO LOWER
 With no market-moving data, Canadian government bond prices
were flat to lower across the curve as the market took a
breather after several days of volatility, said Sheldon Dong,
fixed income analyst at TD Waterhouse Private Investment.
 ""This is just a recovery day after all the volatility we've
had,"" said Dong.
 ""We've seen some wild gyrations. Today is probably the
first session in a long time we've seen relative calm.""
 The two-year government bond  fell 5.5 Canadian
cents to C$99.09 to yield 1.957 percent, while the 30-year bond
 fell 5 Canadian cents to C$117.70 to yield 3.932

 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Gold surged nearly 3 percent
to a record high on Tuesday as investor skepticism overran the
initial euphoria of Europe's $1 trillion euro zone rescue plan,
knocking the euro down and pulling most global share prices
lower.
 Concerns that the efforts to backstop the euro zone
currency are only a short-term fix rather than a long-term
solution drove the flight from riskier assets.
 The safe-haven flows into gold overcame the rise in the
U.S. dollar, which increases the cost of commodities for buyers
in other currencies. Spot gold traded  up $28.90, or 2.40
percent, to $1,230.80, after hitting a record high of
$1,233.65.

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Steven C. Johnson
 LONDON/NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Sterling rose on
Tuesday after Conservative Party leader David Cameron took over
as British prime minister and said he plans to form a coalition
government with the smaller Liberal Democratic party.
 Cameron's move into No. 10 Downing Street removed some of
the uncertainty that drove sterling to a 13-month low against
the dollar last week after an inconclusive election gave no
party an absolute majority in parliament. [ID:nLDE6492UW]
 The pound rose 0.8 percent to $1.4958  after
earlier hitting a session high above $1.50. The euro tumbled
1.6 percent to 84.66 pence 
 Markets had feared after the election that protracted
political stalemate would hamper efforts to tackle the UK's
budget deficit. Cameron replaces Gordon Brown, who resigned as
prime minister on Tuesday with his Labour Party destined for
the opposition after a 13-year run in power.
 ""While we doubt that any government would be able to
quickly put the UK back on a more sustainable fiscal path, this
may raise the risk for 'positive' political surprises and could
leave the pound well positioned to gain,"" said Todd Elmer,
currency strategist at Citigroup in New York.
 A broadly weaker euro and a surprise surge in UK industrial
production data also supported sterling.
 Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS
Securities, recommended investors go long the pound primarily
against the euro, which has been hurt by doubts that a recently
announced $1 trillion package may not be enough to stop a
Greek debt crisis from spreading.
 But he added that ""people are not going to put all their
chips on the table because we have to see what (a new
government) comes up with in terms of a fiscal plan.""
 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION RISES
 Sterling was also bolstered by data showing British
industrial production rose 2.0 percent on the month in March,
its fastest monthly pace since July 2002, and beating market
forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain. [ID:nONS006645]
 Other figures from a UK think tank showed the economy
expanded by 0.5 percent in the three months to April,

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday as
concerns resurfaced about the euro zone's ability to contain a
debt crisis, blunting initial enthusiasm seen after this week's
$1 trillion rescue package.
 The British pound rose after Conservative party leader
David Cameron took over as Britain's prime minister and said he
would form a coalition government. The pound fell to a one-year
low against the U.S. dollar last week on fear of a political
stalemate after an inconclusive UK election. [ID:nLAL004450]
 The euro, meanwhile, retreated from Monday's high near
$1.31, falling below $1.27 as investors wondered whether weaker
euro zone economies can deliver the drastic spending cuts and
tax increases needed to get their fiscal houses in order.
 ""Markets aren't buying the story. It's clear that the
markets remain very concerned about the fiscal outlook for
Europe,"" said Mike Moran, senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ""Clearly, the near-term
outlook is one of skepticism for the euro.""
 The euro traded at $1.2682 , off a session low of
$1.2667 but still down 0.8 percent on the day. Last week, the
euro fell to a 14-month low around $1.2510, and Moran still
expects it to hit $1.15 by the third quarter.
 The U.S. dollar fell 0.6 percent to 92.70 yen .
Traders said the yen was helped by Japanese exporter buying.
The euro fell 1.4 percent to 117.55 yen .
 STERLING GAINS, EURO STRUGGLES PERSIST
 A change at 10 Downing Street lifted sterling broadly,
sending the euro down 1.4 percent to 84.87 pence .
Britain's currency also rose 0.7 percent to $1.4955 
after earlier rising above $1.50.
 Sterling fell below $1.45 last week, a one-year low, for
fear protracted negotiations to form a government would hurt
efforts to get a large budget deficit in order.
 ""The market is giving them the benefit of the doubt, and
euro-sterling was trading quite heavy anyway given all the
problems the euro is facing,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief
international strategist at RBS Securities.
 He said investors bullish on the pound should buy it
against euro rather than the dollar. But he added that ""people
are not going to put all their chips on the table because we
have to see what they come up with in terms of a fiscal plan.""
 As for the euro, analysts said the rescue plan, which would
disburse emergency aid to countries in financial trouble, may
not be enough. Nout Wellink, a member of the European Central
Bank's governing council, told Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad
the plan is a safety net and won't work unless countries cut
debt levels. [ID:nLDE64A1NL]
 Europe's debt trouble showed signs of spreading in recent
weeks as investors drove up borrowing costs for countries such
as Portugal, Spain and Ireland that also face sluggish growth
and high deficits.
 The options market was showing a clear bias toward further
euro losses. The one-month risk-reversal  was
trading at 3.00 for euro puts versus 2.65 on Monday, moving
beyond the previous record seen at the peak of the crisis
surrounding Lehman Brothers' 2008 collapse.
 But Axel Merk, portfolio manager for the $500 million Merk
Hard Currency Fund in Palo Alto, California, said he remains
bullish on the euro.
 ""The euro zone is finally getting its act together. It is
moving toward a more solid fiscal management and there is a
sense that problems are being addressed,"" he said.
 ""At the end of the day, investors will recognize that the
ones in trouble are the fringe countries and not the entire
euro zone. The euro zone will come out stronger in the long
run.""

 By Mark Felsenthal and Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke on Tuesday described the Greek debt crisis to
lawmakers as a European dilemma but one that could have hit
U.S. banks if left unattended, senior senators said.
 ""Chairman Bernanke explained what was going on in Europe,
it was basically a European problem but with ramifications
probably on a lot of our banks and our banking system if there
was no intervention,"" Senator Richard Shelby, the top
Republican on the Senate Banking panel, told reporters after a
closed-door briefing Bernanke provided lawmakers.
 The Fed chairman met with senators to counter concerns the
U.S. central bank's decision to provide dollars to foreign
central banks amounts to helping to bail out debt-strapped
nations. The action buttressed a European-led $1 trillion plan
to stop Greece's debt crisis from spreading.
 The Fed used similar currency swap lines to battle the
2007-2008 global financial crisis but closed them in February
as markets settled. Some lawmakers criticized that effort to
ensure dollar liquidity in overseas markets, saying it put U.S.
taxpayer money at potential risk.
 Bernanke persuaded most U.S. senators at the meeting on
Tuesday that currency swaps are needed to help protect the
United States from financial contagion and do not expose it to
losses, a senior lawmaker said.
""Basically I'm satisfied, I think most of the members were,
there, on the chairman's answers that we are well protected,""
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd told
reporters at the Capitol.
 The Fed on Monday posted ""frequently asked questions"" about
currency swaps on its website, noting dollars the Fed provides
would be paid back in full by other central banks, a message
repeated by Bernanke on Tuesday.
 ""It seemed to me it is a standard procedure that central
banks engage in with each other,"" Republican Senator Bob Corker
said after the briefing.
 The politically touchy move by the Fed comes at a difficult
time for the central bank. It is already battling efforts on
Capitol Hill to remove it from overseeing smaller banks and to
open up monetary policy to congressional audits.
 The Senate on Tuesday approved an amendment to a
wide-ranging financial reform bill that would allow a one-time
audit of the Fed's emergency lending during the financial
crisis. Initially, the amendment would have allowed repeated
audits, but the Fed and its allies in the Senate and Obama
administration successfully fought that off.
 Fed officials say the currency swaps are necessary to
protect the fragile U.S. economic recovery from a serious shock
that could result if the Greek fiscal crisis spreads.
Richmond Fed Bank President Jeffrey Lacker forecast little
political fallout from the reopening of the swaps programs. The
Fed is looking to be ""more transparent around this round of
swaps... We are going to be as transparent as we absolutely can
be,"" he said after a speech in Greensboro, North Carolina.
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers warned that the European turmoil
should serve as a wake-up call to the deficit-heavy United
States to get its own fiscal house in order.
""We could very well end up in the same place without having
the courage to do the things that are necessary in this
country,"" Corker said.
The U.S. central bank said on Sunday it was reopening
currency swap lines with the European Central Bank, the Bank of
Canada, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank. On
Monday, it reopened a swap line with the Bank of Japan.
 In an effort to bolster its case that no taxpayer funds are
at risk, the Fed on Tuesday said it plans to make public
contractual agreements it has for the reopened swap lines. The
Fed will publish details of activity in each of the swaps lines
on a weekly basis, the official added.

 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday as
concerns about the euro zone's ability to contain its debt
crisis overcame the initial euphoria that followed announcement
of a $1 trillion rescue package.
 Germany approved its share of the rescue package on
Tuesday, but the euro dropped back near $1.27, as doubts grew
whether weaker euro zone economies can deliver drastic debt
cuts. The euro on Monday had risen to a high near $1.31 on news
of the joint European Union-International Monetary Fund
rescue.
 ""Markets aren't buying the story. It's clear that the
markets remain very concerned about the fiscal outlook for
Europe,"" said Mike Moran, senior currency strategist at
Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ""Clearly, the near-term
outlook is one of skepticism for the euro.""
 In midday New York trading, the euro was down 0.6 percent
at $1.2710, substantially below Monday's high of $1.3093,
according to Reuters data. Traders cited sales from macro
accounts, while poor liquidity was said to be exacerbating
currency moves.
 Last week, the single euro zone currency fell to a 14-month
trough around $1.2510 on fears the sovereign credit crisis
could spread from Greece to other euro zone countries.
 Moran expects the euro to decline to $1.15 by the third
quarter.
 The options market was showing a clear bias toward the
downside on the euro. The one-month risk-reversal was trading
at 3.00 for euro puts versus 2.65 on Monday, moving beyond the
previous record seen at the peak of the Lehman crisis.
 Against sterling, the euro fell 1.5 percent to 84.81
pence.
 Sterling rose againt the dollar, last trading up 0.7
percent at $1.4947, rebounding from earlier losses.
 Talks to form a new British government entered a decisive
phase on Tuesday with speculation the Conservatives were close
to clinching a deal with the smaller Liberal Democrats while
Labor was being sidelined.
 NOT ENOUGH
 There was increasing skepticism over the EU's rescue plan
on Tuesday. Nout Wellink, a member of the European Central
Bank's governing council, in Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad
said the package is not enough to save the euro zone
structurally.
 On Monday, Moody's Investors Service said it may still
downgrade its credit rating on Portugal and said Greece's
rating could fall to junk grade.
 The aid package ""is just another way of delaying perhaps
the inevitable,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at TD

down the road.""
 Analysts said the European Central Bank's decision to buy
government bonds could also hurt the euro later this year as it
further dampens the likelihood of interest rate hikes in the
euro zone.
 ""I don't think we're going to see perhaps quite as rapid a
fall in the euro over the next few months as we've seen over
the course of the past few weeks. I think the decline is going
to slow down, but certainly the trend is towards a weak euro
over time,"" Osborne said.
 The low-yielding yen posted strong gains, reversing some of
the previous day's losses, as concerns over the euro zone debt
crisis sparked renewed risk aversion among investors.
 The dollar was last down 0.5 percent at 92.83 yen. Traders
said the yen was helped by Japanese exporters selling other
currencies. The euro fell 1 percent to 118.10 yen.
 The U.S. dollar also benefited from safe-haven flows.

dollar index was up 0.2 percent at 84.352.

 * Technical problems delay Medgaz link to Spain further
 
 By Simon Webb and Regan E. Doherty
 DOHA, May 11 (Reuters) - Algeria is resisting pressure from
big gas customers to renegotiate long-term contracts, and
technical problems have further delayed the first Medgaz
pipeline exports to Spain, Algerian energy minister Chakib
Khelil said on Tuesday.
 Algeria supplies about 20 percent of Europe's gas through
existing pipelines to Spain and Italy at prices indexed to oil.
 But plentiful supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have
swelled the European market with cheap alternatives over the
past year, forcing buyers of oil-indexed gas to resell some
contracted fuel at a loss, or not at all.
 Khelil told reporters in Doha on Tuesday its mid-stream
customers had pressured Algeria to bend, so they could compete
effectively with suppliers offering cheap gas snapped up on
Europe's booming spot markets.
 ""Lots of them came and asked to lower volumes and so forth,""
he said when asked whether Algeria's gas buyers had tried to
renegotiate their contracts.
 ""We didn't agree ... We are resisting.""
 Khelil said consumers could be risking their future security
by pushing for cheaper deals and taking minimum amounts on their
long term contracts so they can buy cheap spot gas.
 He warned that low spot prices were making new projects look
less competitive for companies bidding for exploration blocks
that could boost future supply.
 ""If you come back to me every time the price comes down and
tell me 'the price is too high,' then I won't have the
guaranteed volumes,"" he said in the capital of Qatar, the
world's biggest exporter of LNG. 
 ""Which means tomorrow if you ask me about volumes 'too bad
I've sold it to somebody else'.""
 He said Algeria was still getting about $7 per million
British thermal units on its oil index contracts, unchanged from
the first quarter of this year.
 State-run Algerian gas giant Sonatrach has made a second gas
discovery in Libya and is working on offshore exploration in
Egypt, along with exploration projects in Mauritania, Niger, and
Mali, he added.

 MEDGAZ DELAY
 The Medgaz pipeline, which could boost Algerian exports to
Spain by about 8 billion cubic metres a year when it opens, has
been further delayed until September 2010 due to technical
problems on both sides of the subsea pipeline, Khelil said.
 ""This will slow down volumes,"" he said, adding that Algeria
had revised down its European sales expectations for this year
because of the latest in a string of delays to the project. 
 Less than a month ago, the then interim chief executive of
Sonatrach said the pipeline would enter commercial operations in
July.
 Although Spanish gas demand has recovered in the first few
months of 2010, plentiful supplies of LNG for Spain's many
import terminals and ongoing uncertainty about the country's
economic prospects could dampen gas demand growth.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2010 11:40AM ET</span>",Electronic currency trades up 7 pct in 2009-study," NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Electronic currency trading
volumes rose last year despite a decline in overall market
activity, according to a study from Greenwich Associates
released on Tuesday.
 Volumes for this type of trading increased 7 percent in
2009 from 2008, the study said. While this growth was lower
than the 25 percent surge in 2008 from 2007, the increase in
volumes last year suggests market participants shifted their
activity to electronic platforms from other forms of trading,
such as telephones.
 That pushed the share of total foreign currency trading
volume executed electronically to 58 percent in 2009 from 54
percent in 2008, the Greenwich study said.
 ""Around the world, but particularly in the Americas and
Asia, electronic trading systems are attracting new customers,""
said Greenwich Associates consultant Peter D'Amario.
 Last year, electronic trading volumes increased 16 percent
in the Americas, 44 percent in Asia, remained essentially flat
in Continental Europe and fell nearly 10 percent in the United
Kingdom, according to the study.

 * Gold reaches 5-month high on safe-haven flows
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Investors took back Monday's
gains, selling stocks and the euro, vacillating on bonds and
pushing gold to a five-month high on Tuesday unwilling to fully
commit to markets because of concerns the $1 trillion plan to
contain Greece's debt crisis is only a short-term fix, not a
long-term solution.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet backed plans to
contribute 123 billion euros in loan guarantees to support the
euro currency which after initial euphoria on Monday brought it
to $1.31, is now down 0.46 percent on the day to $1.2725
.
 ""We realize now that this is just another way of delaying
perhaps the inevitable,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX
strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. ""It pushes the debt
problems further down the road.""
 U.S. shares opened weaker in New York trade while European
markets floundered. Chinese inflation, rising to an 18-month
high in April, increased concerns the government still has its
work cut out to keep the world's third-largest economy from
boiling over.
 In mid-morning New York trade, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> fell 35.67 points, or 0.33 percent, at
10,749.47. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 4.27

Index <.IXIC> lost 7.93 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,366.74.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
dropped 1.53 percent, giving up some of Monday's 7.39 percent
advance.
 Chinese stocks <.SSEC> fell 1.9 percent to their lowest
level in a year on the worsening inflation outlook.

might downgrade Portugal's debt rating and further cut Greece's
to junk status, noting the contagion effect of Greece's crisis
on other euro zone members. [ID:nN10227186]
 ""The EU was never going to be able to give the markets a
single knock-out blow,"" said Jim Wood-Smith, head of research
at Williams de Broe.
 ""Markets have lost confidence in the EU and the euro. Until
that confidence comes back we're in for a volatile period.""
 The greenback rose 0.33 percent against a basket of major
trading partner currencies <.DXY>.
 But even with the U.S. dollar's strength making the
precious metals more expensive, investors pumped money into
gold, lifting the spot price to $1,223.90 an ounce, its best
level since early December.
 ""Investors are trying to search out safe havens, and
clearly gold is one of those,"" said RBS Global Banking &
Markets analyst Daniel Major. ""While the current environment of
acute investor risk aversion remains, gold is bound to
benefit.""
 DEBT FLAT
 The other traditional safe-haven, government debt, proved
lackluster.
 In Europe, while the cabinet backed the plans, opposition
lawmakers warned it had yet to decide if it backed the rescue
plan, leading European government debt to pare gains.
 Bunds had recouped less than half of Monday's drop, when
they suffered amid euphoria for riskier debt issuers following
the announcement of the European rescue package.
 The June Bund future  was up 17 ticks on the day at
125.66 but off its session high at 126.29.
 Non-core European assets continued to attract attention,
such as 10-year Greek bonds, whose yield spread over Bunds
contracted by 30 basis points - although that was a much
smaller contraction than the 600 bps achieved on Monday
.
 The cost of insuring Greek debt against default for five
years fell to 560 basis points from 584.4 bps in New York on
Monday, according to Credit Default Swap monitor CMA
DataVision.
 Volatile trade left U.S. Treasuries little changed. A raft
of new issues may have also dampened demand.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were off 2/32 of a point
in price, pushing the yield up to 3.54 percent .

 * German contribution could rise beyond 123 bln euros
 * Opposition SPD says Germany risks footing the entire bill
 
 By Dave Graham
 BERLIN, May 11 (Reuters) - Germany's cabinet on Tuesday
backed plans to stump up 123 billion euros in loan guarantees to
support the euro, two days after international policymakers
agreed on a $1 trillion package to restore calm to markets.
 The cabinet's rapid approval of the euro plan in a special
session follows criticism that Merkel took too long to back a
rescue for Greece, stoking market tensions and rendering the
final bailout much more expensive than it would have been.
 ""The measures are a clear signal that the financial markets
can count on the financial stability of the euro area,""
government spokesman Christoph Steegmans told a news briefing,
adding he hoped the plan could clear parliament by June 4.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel's ministers signed off the draft
law which would see Germany provide loans valid until mid-2013
to countries deemed to be insolvent by other euro states, the
International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.
 Loans would be contingent on countries agreeing measures
with the IMF and the ECB to tackle their deficits.
 Steegmans said the government had held the special meeting
of the cabinet -- one day earlier than normal -- to underline
its commitment to the package as quickly as possible.
 Speaking on condition of anonymity, another member of the
government said Germany's contribution to the package could be
raised by up to 20 percent with the approval of the German
Bundestag lower house of parliament's budgetary committee.
 The approval came after EU leaders agreed at the weekend to
provide 500 billion euros to stabilise the European single
currency -- 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro states
plus 60 billion euros in a European stabilisation fund.
 Markets rallied on the European aid package at the start of
the week, but on Tuesday the euro fell against other currencies
and shares slipped as the relief dissipated.
 Another worry for Merkel is the health of her finance
minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who was taken to hospital at the
weekend and did not attend Tuesday's cabinet meeting.
 Finance Ministry spokesman Michael Offer told the news
conference that media speculation of Schaeuble resigning was
""not an issue"" between the minister and Merkel.
 
 DREADFUL
 Merkel eventually backed a Greek rescue in the face of
widespread public opposition, and critics of the euro package
wasted no time in condemning the government.
 ""We are Europe's fools again!"" ran a front page headline on
Tuesday on Germany's biggest selling daily, Bild.
 Together with a contribution from the International Monetary
Fund worth some 250 billion euros, the euro support plan was set
to total 750 billion euros, or about $1 trillion.
 Manfried Hochwald, a rail worker from Potsdam, said he was
appalled by the bailout but did not believe Germany could afford
to turn its back on the euro and return to the deutschemark.
 ""I think it's dreadful, but without it, the euro could
implode,"" said Hochwald, 56. ""Naturally when you link countries
together, something like this can happen. But to go back to the
mark? No. The euro is stronger.""
 The ECB has also said it is prepared to buy government bonds
to underpin the euro, though details remain vague.
 Germany's lower house of parliament is due to begin debating
the euro bill next week, and Merkel is likely to seek as much
opposition support as possible because of public hostility.
 The main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) said they had not
decided whether to support the euro package, and warned the
country could end up footing the entire cost of the bill.
 SPD parliamentary whip Thomas Oppermann told ARD television
there were still too many open questions about the plan.
 ""What happens if other countries who get aid from the
package drop out? In the worst case scenario, the Germans may
have to guarantee the 440 billion euros alone, and we won't be
able to do that,"" Oppermann said.
 ""After the Lehman crisis, after the Greek crisis, we're for
the third time faced with the decision of approving packages the
German taxpayer will probably have to pay for in the end.""
 The government has said the German share could rise because
not all EU member states would have the means to participate.
 Meanwhile, hedge funds, banks and speculators could do what
they wanted on financial markets, Oppermann said.
 ""A substantial participation of the banks and hedge funds in
the costs of the crisis must be arranged,"" he said.
 If the government did approve a bill to introduce a
financial transaction tax, then it was ""not ruled out"" the SPD
would back the European aid package, Oppermann said.
 The centre-left SPD abstained from voting on the Greek aid
package last week after failing to push through an addendum in
support of a European financial transaction tax.
 The make-up of the Bundesrat upper house is still unclear
after Merkel's centre-right coalition lost its automatic
majority in elections in North Rhine-Westphalia at the weekend.
 The government said it was not clear how this could affect
the Bundesrat's approval of the euro aid bill.

 (Adds quotes, detail, background)
 STOCKHOLM, May 11 (Reuters) - Swedish central banker
Karolina Ekholm said on Tuesday that interest rates would need
to be raised from current record-low levels of 0.25 percent
""relatively soon"" to avoid households taking on too much debt.
 Riksbank Deputy Governor Ekholm said the rapid increase in
lending to households created risks and could lead some to
borrow excessively, creating problems once interest rates
started to rise.
 ""To avoid this, which would make it more difficult to attain
price stability and stable resource utilisation, the interest
rate needs to be raised relatively soon,"" she said in a speech
posted on the Riksbank's website.
 ""My personal assessment is that extremely low interest rates
lead to some increase in the risk that housing prices will be
pushed up to unsustainable levels.""
 However, Ekholm said that a bursting housing bubble
qualified as a risk with ""low probability"".
 Household lending growth has approached double digits in
recent quarters while real estate prices have surged despite the
economic downturn, prompting some analysts and banking
executives to warn of a housing bubble.
 Looking to the risks posed elsewhere in Europe, Ekholm said
that while Sweden and its banks had little exposure to Greece,
problems surrounding the Mediterranean country's debt crisis
were ""important factors"" when predicting the future course of
the Swedish economy.
 "" ... the Riksbank follows developments closely and has
regular contacts with Swedish banks and with other central
banks,"" she said. ""We are as always prepared to take whatever
measures are necessary to safeguard financial stability.""

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday with
the fading of a relief rally triggered by a $1 trillion rescue
package aimed at stabilizing the euro zone's sovereign debt, as
markets refocused their attention on Europe's debt problems.
 The euro dropped back near $1.27, surrendering Monday's
gains which propelled it to a high near $1.31, as investors
remain concerned about the details of the package and whether
it would solve the region's debt problems in the long term.
 ""We realize now that this is just another way of delaying
perhaps the inevitable,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX
strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. ""It pushes the debt
problems further down the road.""
 ""I don't think we're going to see perhaps quite as rapid a
fall in the euro over the next few months as we've seen over
the course of the past few weeks. I think the decline is going
to slow down, but certainly the trend is towards a weak euro
over time,"" he added.
 In early New York trading, the euro was down 0.5 percent at
$1.2719 , substantially below Monday's high of $1.3093,
according to Reuters data. Traders cited sales from macro
accounts, while poor liquidity was said to be exacerbating
currency moves.
 Last week, the single euro zone currency fell to a 14-month
trough around $1.2510 on fears the sovereign credit crisis
could spread from Greece to other euro zone countries.
 The options market was showing a clear bias towards the
downside on the euro. The one-month risk-reversal
 was trading at 3.00 for euro puts versus 2.65 on
Monday, moving beyond the previous record seen at the peak of
the Lehman crisis.
 Moody's Investors Service said on Monday it may still
downgrade Portugal and that Greece's rating could fall to junk
grade. [ID:nN10227186]
 ""Concern is creeping in as to whether southern European
countries can fulfill their budget requirements,"" said Niels
Christensen, currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""With the fiscal tightening that will be needed there is a
risk of lower euro zone growth and that the European Central
Bank will start raising rates later than previously expected,""
he added.
 UK POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
 Sterling declined against the dollar as the prospect of the
Labour party holding on to power in a coalition with the
Liberal Democrats began to weigh on UK assets. See

 Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Monday he would step
aside to entice the Liberal Democrats into a pact with his
Labour Party, and away from an alliance with the Conservatives,
who won the most seats in last Thursday's general election, but
fell short of an overall majority. [ID:nLDE6492UW]
 Sterling last traded down 0.1 percent  at $1.4827.
 The low-yielding yen posted strong gains, reversing some of
the previous day's losses, as concerns over the euro zone debt
crisis sparked renewed risk aversion among investors.
 The dollar was down 0.6 percent at 92.69 yen .
Traders said the yen was helped by Japanese exporters selling
other currencies. The euro fell 1.2 percent to 117.84 yen
.
 The U.S. dollar also benefited from safe haven flows.

 WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke will meet U.S. senators on Tuesday to counter concerns
the Fed's decision to provide dollars to foreign central banks
amounts to helping bail out debt-strapped nations.
 A source familiar with the meeting said the Senate Banking
Committee had invited Bernanke to discuss the international
situation.
 The Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- said on Sunday it was
reopening currency swap lines with the European Central Bank
and other central banks around the world to ease liquidity
strains from an escalating sovereign debt crisis.
 The Fed on Monday posted ""frequently asked questions"" about
currency swaps on its website noting that the dollars the Fed
provides would be paid back in full by other central banks.
 Fed officials say the swaps are necessary to protect the
fragile U.S. economic recovery from a serious shock that could
result if the Greek fiscal crisis spreads.
 On Tuesday, the Fed, which has been criticized for lack of
transparency in its emergency programs, plans to make public
contractual agreements it has with central banks including
those of Switzerland, Britain, Japan and Canada, a Fed official
said. The Fed will publish details of activity in each of the
swaps lines on a weekly basis, the official said.
 Lawmakers have attacked the Fed for shielding details of
emergency lending during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The
Fed finds itself in the politically sensitive position of
responding to a new crisis in Europe even as Congress debates
legislation mandating greater transparency in Fed programs.

 * Countries becoming addicted to support of great concern
 * ECB could construct new instruments to sterilise buying
 
 (adds quotes, detail, Wellink comments)
 VIENNA, May 11 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's move
to buy government bonds has stabilised frenetic markets and it
makes sense to continue it, Ewald Nowotny, one of the bank's
Governing Council members, told Reuters on Tuesday.
 ""The way how it is moving now it's quite positive,"" Nowotny
said in an interview with Reuters Insider television.
 ""The intention is to get again control of the unorderly
markets and I think this is a goal that has been achieved
remarkably in an effective way, so I think it makes sense to
stay on the way we have started.""
 Euro zone central banks started buying government bonds on
Monday as a key part of a $1 trillion bid to resolve the
region's debt crisis.
 Details of the plan remain vague, however. There is still no
hint of how much the ECB is prepared to spend, what maturities
or bonds it will target, if it has specific aims for yields or
how long it expects the process to take.
 Nowotny said the ECB would target problem areas in the bond
market, suggesting it will stick to bonds where yields spike, a
problems suffered by Greek, Portuguese, Spanish, Irish and
Italian debt in recent weeks.
""Where these elements (troubles) come up is where we want to
see correction,"" the head of the Austria central bank said.
 The ECB's buying programme will not solve the problems
alone, however.
 ""The main task of stabilising rests with the countries
themselves,"" Nowotny warned, adding that there was ""great
concern"" among ECB policymakers that countries could become
overly dependent on the bond buying programme.
 Nout Wellink, the head of the Dutch central bank struck a
similar tone in a newspaper interview on Tuesday. ""That problem
(debt in some countries) needs to be solved, the safety net has
a temporary nature,"" Wellink told NRC.
 Nowotny stressed the ECB's credibility had not been
tarnished by the abrupt change of direction by the bank coming
just days after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank
had not discussed such a move.
 He said it showed the ECB could make vital, tough decisions.
 It was also discussing new ways to sterilise -- or
counterbalance -- the money being pumped into the system by
buying up bonds.
 ""We have of course the possibility for the ECB to take money
in from banks, but maybe we will also construct some other
additional instruments.
 ""This is just a discussion we are leading, there is no
immediate need because we have the deposit facility and
instruments that are available and are quite substantial but it
might be a good idea to expand the arsenal,"" Nowotny said.

 * Takashima says ready to review DPJ's spending programmes
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Yuko Yoshikawa
 TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japan's ruling Democratic Party
does not back the finance minister's call for a cap on bond
issuance for next fiscal year, a senior party lawmaker said on
Tuesday, as the Greek debt crisis puts pressure on Japan to fix
its tattered finances.
 Yoshimitsu Takashima, the party's deputy secretary general,
also said the government did not need to submit to parliament a
bill to restore fiscal discipline, despite the finance
minister's desire to do so.
 Japan must instead overhaul its spending plans so that money
spent wastefully on public works projects is diverted to
programmes aimed at supporting households, said Takashima, who
is tasked with drafting the party's campaign platform for an
upper house election expected in July.
 ""Without making such efforts, we cannot gain people's
understanding for setting a cap on bond issuance and seeking
future tax hikes,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan said on Tuesday that Japan would
try to ensure that next fiscal year's new bond issuance does not
exceed this year's record 44.3 trillion yen ($474.7 billion).
 But Takashima said the party did not share Kan's view.
 ""I think that was his personal view,"" Takashima said. ""I
guess he wanted to raise the alarm that Japan could face such a
situation as Greece does in the future.""
 Many government and ruling party officials are cautious
about any talk of a tax hike or a less expansionary fiscal
policy for fear of alienating voters ahead of the upper house
election.
 
 SUPPORT FALLING
 Public support for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's
government has been crumbling as he dithered over the relocation
of a U.S. Marine base on the southern island of Okinawa, casting
doubt on his leadership.
 Takashima said the party was ready to review its ambitious
spending programmes when it finalises its campaign platform by
the end of this month, given Japan's severe fiscal situation.
 The Democratic Party-led government's big spending
programmes have drawn warnings from ratings agencies. Japan's
public debt ratio, at nearly twice the size of its gross
domestic product, is the highest among G7 nations.
 On monetary policy, Takashima said he wanted the Bank of
Japan to help in beating deflation and achieving inflation of
around 1 to 2 percent, roughly in line with the central bank's
definition of long-term price stability.
 But he said his party should not include in its campaign
platform a demand for the BOJ to set a rigid inflation target,
as it would not do much good to the economy.
 The BOJ instead should do more to support industries with
growth potential such as environment, health care, tourism and
technology, Takashima said, welcoming the central bank's
decision last month to consider setting up a framework for this
purpose.
 ""The BOJ is supposed to act on neutral ground with the
administration. But it should also consider ways to support
government's economic policy at times,"" he said.
 The BOJ said last month it would consider ways to support
private financial institutions that lend to industries with
growth potential. While details are yet to be decided, the bank
is expected to offer low-interest loans to private banks that
lend to such industries.

World Trade Organisation this year, Russia's first deputy prime
minister Igor Shuvalov said on Tuesday, flagging progress in the
decade-and-a-half old accession process.
""It's tough, but it's possible,"" Shuvalov told a news

 ""Our meeting in Washington was favourable on both sides.""
 Russia has frequently predicted its imminent entry to the
WTO but the process has repeatedly been held up by outstanding
differences between Moscow and existing members.
 Shuvalov said the status of Russian state-owned enterprises
was one of the stumbling blocks to WTO accession.
 Some countries such as the United States fear
state-controlled companies could have an unfair advantage and
would want guarantees in any accession deal.
 Russia said last month it would pursue a separate bid to
join the WTO, dropping its insistence on joining as a customs
union with Belarus and Kazakhstan. [ID:nN26503194]
 ""We are talking with the Americans now. Our (customs union)
partners understand that once Russia is there, it's going to be
better for everyone, all the major principles of the single
market will be based on WTO principles,"" Shuvalov said.
 Shuvalov said plans to form a customs union with Belarus and
Kazakhstan were going ahead, with the union to be in place by
January 2012.
 ""The presidents want us to deliver by January 2012, it's not
easy.""
 Currency union could follow customs union, he added.
 ""If we have all these (customs union) agreements in place by
2012, then the next stage for discussion is going to be the
currency. The customs union needs to work perfectly -- if
everything goes well, then maybe currency.""

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday as the
relief rally unleashed by an emergency aid package to prevent
the spread of a euro zone debt crisis dissipated and the focus
switched back to structural problems plaguing the bloc.
 European Union finance ministers, central bankers and the
International Monetary Fund hammered out an emergency package of
loan guarantees to euro zone members over the weekend to shore
up sentiment in bond markets and the euro. [ID:nSGE6490HH]
 ""Risk is back off and the euro is weak across the board.
Concern is creeping in as to whether southern European countries
can fulfil their budget requirements,"" said Niels Christensen,
currency strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen.
 ""With the fiscal tightening that will be needed there is a
risk of lower euro zone growth and that the European Central
Bank will start raising rates later than previously expected.
This is all playing into a negative environment for the euro.""
 The ""shock and awe"" plan initially propelled the euro
 close to $1.31 on Monday and off a 14-month trough around
$1.2510 last week when investors feared the sovereign credit
crisis could spread from Greece to other euro zone countries.
 At 1125 GMT, the euro traded down 0.8 percent at $1.2680
, taking it substantially below Monday's high, with
traders noting sales from macro accounts. Poor liquidity was
said to be exacerbating moves.
 Moody's Investors Service said on Monday it may still
downgrade Portugal and Greece's rating could fall to junk grade,
a comment Christensen said highlighted that the rescue package
had ""not resolved the crisis"". [ID:nN10227186]
 The options market was showing a clear bias for euro
downside. The one-month risk-reversal  was trading
at 3.00 for euro puts versus 2.65 on Monday, moving beyond the
previous record seen at the peak of the Lehman crisis.

 QUESTIONS
 Analysts said uncertainty over the details of the EU/IMF aid
package were also weighing on the single currency.
 ""There are question marks regarding the details of the
package, such as how bond purchases would be sterlised. Negative
sentiment over the currency persists and it should remain under
further pressure,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency
strategy at HSBC.
 Political uncertainty put pressure on sterling as Britain's
two big rival political parties resumed courting the smaller
Liberal Democrats after last week's inconclusive election.
[ID:nUKVOTES]
 Sterling fell 0.8 percent  to $1.4729.
 The low-yielding yen posted strong gains, reversing some of
the previous day' losses, as concerns over the euro zone debt
crisis sparked renewed risk aversion among investors, with
European stocks <.FTEU3> down around 2 percent.
 The dollar was down 1 percent at 92.33 yen . Traders
said the yen was helped by Japanese exporters selling other
currencies. The euro fell 1.8 percent to 117.05 yen ,
a day after jumping around 4 percent.
 The yen remained within its recent wide trading ranges,
however. Over the last week, dollar/yen has traded between a
high of just below 95 yen and a low of 88.00 yen.
 The U.S. dollar also benefited from safe haven flows, with
the dollar index <.DXY> up 0.7 pct at 84.713.

the credit it lost in recent weeks.""

(ECB) boosted cash supply in the market via its short and long
term liquidity operations on Tuesday, re-starting its U.S.

 The ECB decided on Monday to re-establish currency swap
lines with the U.S. Federal Reserve as part of its plan to stop
Greece's debt woes from spreading and aims to keep ample
liquidity for investors available on favourable terms.
 Banks borrowed $9.2 billion (7.25 billion euros) at the

operations were stopped as part of the ECB's exit strategy, and
paid 1.22 percent interest.

(Adds PM comments)
 By Stanley White and Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yukio
Hatoyama undercut his finance minister's efforts to cap new bond
issuance for the next fiscal year, even as Greece's debt crisis
adds pressure on Tokyo to rein in its huge public deficit.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan said on Tuesday he will try to
ensure that next fiscal year's new bond issuance does not exceed
this year's record 44.3 trillion yen ($474.7 billion).
 But Hatoyama said the government has not made a formal
decision on whether to cap debt issuance, reinforcing views in
the market that Kan's warnings about Japan's worsening public
finances will go unheeded.
 ""This has not been decided by the government and I think
that the Finance Minister was expressing his views. This idea is
not mine,"" Hatoyama told reporters on Tuesday.
 A senior ruling party official also told Reuters that he did
not share Kan's view that the government should set a cap on new
debt issuance.
 Financial markets have been shaken up by debt problems in
the euro zone, prompting downgrades from ratings agencies, who
have also threatened to cut Japan's sovereign ratings if it
doesn't show a strong commitment to cutting debt in a mid-term
fiscal plan expected next month.
 Analysts are sceptical whether Kan or National Strategy
Minister Yoshito Sengoku, who also urged greater fiscal caution,
will get support for spending cuts or tax hikes from others in
the government ahead of upper house elections expected in July.
 ""Fiscal hawks like Kan and Sengoku seem to want to curtail
new debt next fiscal year,"" said Naomi Hasegawa, senior
strategist, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.
 ""But that seems to be their personal preference, rather than
the government's stance, given the lack of leadership in this
government.""
 Support for Hatoyama's government is languishing around 20
percent, boding ill for his party's prospects in the upper house
elections, and some analysts doubt he will want to send signals
about trimming spending for fear of alienating voters.
 Kan, speaking at a news conference, warned against
complacency, saying that with markets becoming increasingly
sensitive to sovereign risk, Japan needed to come up with a
sustainable long-term fiscal policy.
 ""As the situation in Greece and the euro zone show, when
markets lose confidence in a country, it's not just about fiscal
conditions becoming severe. It poses huge damage to people's
livelihoods,"" said Kan, who is also deputy prime minister.
 ""Markets are becoming sensitive to sovereign risk so in
order to prevent this from happening we need to make as much
effort as possible so that issuance does not exceed 44.3
trillion yen.""
 The government may consider capping some areas of spending
when it crafts the state budget for the year beginning in April
2011, Kan said.
 GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY
 Concerns about debt burdens in European countries have
rattled financial markets globally, and European Union finance
ministers, central bankers and the International Monetary Fund
agreed an emergency rescue package worth about $1 trillion in
marathon talks at the weekend.
 Financial markets had started to punish other euro zone debt
of members with bloated budgets such as Portugal and Spain.
 Japan has been immune to this kind of market scare despite
the balance of its public debt being the worst among G7 nations,
mainly because of its huge private savings and the fact
government debt is held mostly by domestic investors.
 Its outstanding debts rose to a record 882.92 trillion yen
as the fiscal year ended in March, which is almost twice the
size of its gross domestic product, according to finance
ministry data.
 Sengoku, in charge of crafting a long-term strategy for the
state budget, also said markets may start reacting to Japan's
high outstanding debt, depending on the current account balance.
 ""Japan needs to draw a lesson from Greece's problems and to
take steps on fiscal discipline with a stronger sense of crisis
than before,"" he told a news conference on Tuesday.
 Japanese government bonds shrugged off the comments and
yields rose ahead of an auction of 10-year debt.
 The Democratic Party-led government's ambitious spending
agenda has drawn warnings from ratings agencies.
 Bond yields and credit default swap spreads ground higher
last year as the government compiled a record $1 trillion budget
for the fiscal year starting in April 2010.
 Tax revenues are expected to make up less than half the
government's 2010/11 budget, falling behind new debt borrowing
for the first time since World War Two for an initial budget,
after a deep recession that devastated company profits.

 TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japan's main ruling party does not
share the finance minister's view about setting a cap on new
government bond issuance for the next fiscal year, a senior
party lawmaker said, shrugging off concerns about Tokyo's fiscal
woes amid Greece's debt crisis.
 Yoshimitsu Takashima, deputy secretary general of the
Democratic Party of Japan, also said he sees no need for the
government to submit a fiscal reform bill to parliament ahead of
upper house elections expected in July, despite the finance
minister's desire to do so.
 Instead, Takashima, who is tasked with drafting the party's
election campaign platform, said Japan must strive to overhaul
its fiscal spending in a way that would support households and
reduce wasteful spending on public works.
 The platform will be finalised by the end of this month.
 ""Without making such efforts, we cannot gain people's
understanding by setting a cap on JGB issuance and seeking
future tax hikes,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan said on Tuesday Japan will try to
ensure that next fiscal year's new bond issuance does not exceed
this year's record 44.3 trillion yen ($474.7 billion).
 ""We do not at all (share his view). I think that was his
personal view... I guess he wanted to raise the alarm that Japan
could face such a situation as Greece does in the future.""

 * Focus back on structural problems plaguing euro zone
 
 (Adds quote, detail)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday as the
relief rally unleashed by an emergency aid package to prevent
the spread of a euro zone debt crisis dissipated and the focus
switched back to structural problems plaguing the bloc.
 European Union finance ministers, central bankers and the
International Monetary Fund hammered out an emergency package of
loan guarantees to euro zone members over the weekend to try to
shore up sentiment in its bond markets and the euro.

 The ""shock and awe"" plan initially boosted sentiment,
propelling the euro close to $1.31 on Monday and off a 14-month
trough of $1.2510 hit on trading platform EBS last week when
investors had feared the sovereign credit crisis could spread
from Greece to other euro zone countries.
 At 0930 GMT on Tuesday, the euro had slipped back to trade
with losses of around 0.8 percent at $1.2675, with traders
noting sales from macro accounts. Poor liquidity was said to be
exacerbating moves.
 ""Monday was a relief rally and now it's back to reality as
people are looking at the facts. Greece has to consolidate its
finances and the euro is still not attractive,"" said Antje
Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank.
 Investors doubt whether the Greek government will be able to
carry out the austerity measures required to restructure its
public finances. Other states such as Portugal and Spain also
have budgetary concerns.
 Moody's Investors Service said on Monday it may still
downgrade Portugal and Greece's rating could fall to junk grade.

 The euro fell 1.5 percent to 117.42 yen, a day after jumping
around 4 percent versus the Japanese currency.
 Analysts said worries over the specific details of EU/IMF
aid package were also weighing on the currency.
 ""There are question marks regarding the details of the
package, such as how bond purchases would be sterlised. Negative
sentiment over the currency persists and it should remain under
further pressure,"" said Paul Mackel, director of currency
strategy at HSBC.
 The options market was showing a clear bias for euro
downside. The one-month risk-reversal was trading at 3.00 for
euro puts versus 2.65 on Monday, moving beyond the previous
record seen at the peak of the Lehman crisis.
 UK POLITICAL POSTURING
 Political uncertainty put pressure on sterling as Britain's
two big rival political parties planned to resume courting the
Liberal Democrats after Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he
would step aside to try to keep his Labour Party in power.
 Sterling was able to pare losses to trade at $1.4845 versus
the dollar after UK industrial output jumped more than six times
faster than expected in March.
 The dollar was down 0.8 percent at 92.43 yen. Traders said
the yen was helped by Japanese exporters selling other
currencies.
 The yen's climb picked up pace as stocks slipped into
negative territory, prompting investors to reduce risks.

 By Salah Sarrar
 TRIPOLI, May 11 (Reuters) - Officials from the European
Union and Libya said they were on track to sign their first
cooperation pact this year, cementing ties that bring EU
countries lucrative trade and help control illegal immigration.
 The EU lifted sanctions on energy exporter Libya in 2004
after the country's leader, Muammar Gaddafi, renounced illegal
weapons programmes, but the bloc still has no formal relations
and no representative mission in Libya.
 Diplomatic ties suffered a setback earlier this year when
Tripoli, angered that Switzerland was barring entry to senior
Libyans including members of Gaddafi's family, stopped issuing
visas to most Europeans, but that row has since been resolved.

between Libya and the EU will create a legal framework which
could eventually lead to free trade and more cooperation on
stemming the flow of illegal migrants from Africa to Europe.
 ""Some chapters related to trade are still under discussion
and probably the agreement will be signed before the end of this
year,"" Mohamed Siala, Secretary for Cooperation at the Libyan
Foreign Ministry, told Reuters.
 An EU envoy said the next round of talks on the agreement
would be early next month. ""We hope to finalize it maybe by the
end of the year,"" said Adrianus Koetsenruijter, head of the
bloc's delegation to neighbouring Tunisia.
 The ambassador also told Reuters the EU would for the first
time set up a diplomatic mission in Libya, and that he expected
it to be open before the end of the year.
 ""Since we have started to establish for the first time
relations between the EU and Libya, we need to have a presence
on the spot, an embassy in fact of the EU,"" he said.
 ""That always takes a bit of time to decide but I just
finalised an agreement on establishing such an office here,"" he
said on a visit to the Libyan capital.
 
 TRADE PARTNER
 Energy exporter Libya has become a major source of revenue
for European firms. 
 Italy's ENI and Spain's Repsol are big players in the oil
and gas sector while aerospace firm EADS has sold aircraft to
Libya.
 Libya's sovereign wealth fund has invested in European
companies, with a focus on former colonial power Italy. It has a
stake in Italy's second biggest bank, Unicredit and a small
share in carmaker Fiat.
 EU states and especially Italy also rely on Libya's police
and coastguard to apprehend migrants, most of them from
sub-Saharan Africa, who try in large numbers to cross the
Mediterranean and enter Europe illegally.
 Libya's decision to stop issuing visas to most European
citizens was linked to a row with Switzerland that began in 2008
when Gaddafi's son Hannibal was arrested in Geneva on charges --
which were later dropped -- of mistreating two employees.
 Tripoli started issuing visas again after the EU lifted
travel restrictions on Libyans and expressed its regret over the
affair. Libya's Foreign Minister said after the EU's climb-down
that ties were back to normal.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2010 05:28AM ET</span>",Germany might have to foot entire euro aid bill-SPD," BERLIN, May 11 (Reuters) - Germany's opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) said on Tuesday they had not decided whether to
support a European rescue package for the euro, and warned the
country could end up footing the entire cost of the bill.
 The package -- 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro
states plus 60 billion euros in a European stabilisation fund --
includes some 123 billion in loan guarantees from Germany, a
German government source told Reuters on Tuesday.
 Another source said Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet had
approved Germany's share in the aid, which has been strongly
criticized by conservative media and could face a legal
challenge at the country's highest court.
 SPD parliamentary whip Thomas Oppermann told ARD television
there were still too many open questions about the plan, which
parliament is due to begin debating next week.
 ""What happens if other countries who get aid from the
package drop out? Will the German share increase then?,"" he
said.
 The government has said the German share could rise because
not all EU member states would have the means to participate.
 ""In the worst case scenario, the Germans may have to
guarantee the 440 billion euros alone, and we won't be able to
do that,"" added Oppermann.
 ""After the Lehman crisis, after the Greek crisis, we're for
the third time faced with the decision of approving packages the
German taxpayer will probably have to pay for in the end.""
 The opposition Greens said on Monday the plan was unlikely
to come to a parliamentary vote before June.
 Although Merkel does not need the SPD's support to get the
financial aid package bill through the lower house of
parliament, she is keen for as much backing as possible due to
widespread public opposition to Germany financing any bailouts.
 The make-up of the upper house is still unclear after
Merkel's centre-right coalition lost its automatic majority in
elections in North Rhine-Westphalia at the weekend.
 ""We are Europe's fools again!"" Germany's biggest selling
daily, Bild, said on its front page on Tuesday.
 Meanwhile, hedge funds, banks and speculators could do what
they wanted on financial markets, Oppermann said.
 ""A substantial participation of the banks and hedge funds in
the costs of the crisis must be arranged,"" he said.
 ""Today we'll probably just see a simple authorisation of
credit again. That can't be it. If we want to protect the
euro...then measures must be agreed that at least make
speculative trading on markets harder or even impossible.""
 If the government did approve a bill to introduce a
financial transaction tax, then it was ""not ruled out"" the SPD
would back the European aid package, Oppermann said.
 The centre-left SPD abstained from voting on the Greek aid
package last week after failing to push through an addendum in
support of a European financial transaction tax.
 EU finance ministers said the International Monetary Fund
was expected to contribute 250 billion euros to the package,
taking the total to 750 billion euros, about $1 trillion.

 * Urges ""appropriate policy adjustments"" to boost growth
 
 (Adds quotes, details from report)
 MILAN, May 11 (Reuters) - Italy's exit from recession will
probably be slower than that of other euro zone economies, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday in its May
outlook report.
 ""Other large euro-area economies are set to emerge more
slowly from recession, notably Italy; and Spain is seen as still
contracting in 2010,"" the IMF said in its ""Regional economic
outlook: Europe"" report.
 The IMF said it sees Italy's deficit to gross domestic
product (GDP) ratio at 5.2 percent in 2010 and inflation at 1.4
percent. 
 The Italian government has said it expects the deficit to
fall to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2011 from 5.0 percent in 2010, and
to 2.7 percent in 2012.
 Italy, Portugal, Spain and other euro zone member states are
under pressure to get budget deficits and debt under control and
prevent contagion from Greece's debt crisis.
 The Italian government is likely to bring forward to this
month budget correction measures worth some 25 billion euros to
fulfil its 2011-2012 deficit-cutting targets, a source close to
the matter told Reuters on Monday.
 The IMF said a lack of competitiveness would continue to
slow Italian growth if deep-rooted fiscal policies were not
agreed in the mid-term.
 ""Although the current global financial crisis has forced
some reduction in current account deficits, they are expected to
remain high in the medium term as a result of the countries' low
productivity and weak competitiveness"", the IMF said, referring
to Italy, Portugal and Greece.
 ""The impact of appropriate policy adjustments can be large,""
it said, adding if Italy, Portugal and Spain were to raise
labour productivity to levels seen in Finland and the
Netherlands, their current accounts would improve by 2-2.5
percentage points of GDP.

 By Blaise Robinson
 PARIS, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday and
stocks retreated as a relief rally ignited by a $1 trillion plan
to contain Greece's debt crisis ran out of steam, while doubts
on how the country will cut its budget deficit persisted.
 The euro  dropped back to below $1.27 and European
shares <.FTEU3> fell 2 percent, surrendering some of Monday's
massive gains. Chinese stocks <.SSEC> meanwhile slipped 1.9
percent to their lowest level in a year on mounting concerns
over China's worsening inflation outlook.
 Wall Street was also set to trim Monday's stellar gains,
with U.S. stock index futures    down 0.9-1.3

 Overall, world stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> were down 0.9 percent.
Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> dipped 0.7 percent while emerging

 ""Markets have lost confidence in the EU and the euro. Until

 The ""shock and awe"" plan unveiled over the weekend initially
lifted sentiment, propelling the euro  close to $1.31 on
Monday and the STOXX Europe 600 banking index <.SX7P> jumping
nearly 15 percent.
 But after the initial euphoria, investors turned cautious
again on Tuesday, worrying that the plan was not a long-term
solution to the euro zone's sovereign debt problems.
 In a sobering note, the International Monetary Fund said
that even though Greece's public debt was sustainable over the
medium term, the nation faced plenty of risks. [ID:nN10120683]
 Moody's credit ratings agency also warned on Monday that it
might downgrade Portugal's debt rating and further cut Greece's

on other euro zone members. [ID:nN10227186]

of the rescue package.
 ""There is an awful lot of hard work and belt-tightening to
be done. The markets have factored in a recovery that hasn't
been achieved yet.""
 
 CHINA TIGHTENING WORRIES

hit an 18-month high in April and bank lending topped
expectations, although the full suite of monthly data signalled
an economy that is not overheating as some have feared.

 Oil dropped to below $76 a barrel while base metal prices
also lost ground. Gold prices rose, hitting five-month highs in
Europe, helped by renewed concerns over the euro zone's fiscal
health.
 Core euro zone government bond prices climbed, tracking
gains in U.S. Treasuries .
 The June Bund future  was up 54 ticks on the day at
126.03. The 10-year Bund yield  was down 4.7 bps at
2.901 percent while the two-year Schatz yield  was
down 3.6 basis points at 0.573 percent.
 Traders said they were anxious to see whether peripheral
sovereign debt yield spreads would widen, reversing some of the

1352,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2010 04:48AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-German commentaries on euro zone debt crisis," May 11 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet
approved Germany's part in a $1 trillion emergency rescue
package to stabilise the euro on Tuesday.
 Following are extracts from Tuesday's German newspapers on
the euro zone crisis:
 
 BILD (Mass circulation)
 Front page headline: ""We are Europe's fools again!""
 ""Yes, the euro is a godsend. Yes, the euro is a guarantor of
our peace and wealth. Yes, leaving the euro should never be an
issue for us Germans.
 But the ""rescue umbrella"" for the euro is a failure for
Europe. It is what the fathers of the euro, above all Helmut
Kohl, did not want... Angela Merkel, the ""Iron Chancellor"" has
rolled over and we are taken to the cleaners.
 ""We Germans have made sacrifices for a stable euro for the
last 10 years with wage restraint and no pensions' rises. We
have paid the price while others have been partying at our
expense... Now the Chancellor is telling us some of the truth:
there will be no tax cuts in the next two years. That is the
shocking message: others have notched up debts and we must
tighten our belts. Europe's road into the Transfer Union is
leading us into decay!""
 
 SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG (Centre-left)
 ""750 billion euros is a huge amount.. it commands respect
and possibly fear.""
""Fear is fuelled by a broad lack of understanding about what
is happening on financial markets.. but we are experiencing
things that can be explained... World states have lived over
their means for a long time. 
 ""It is no peculiarity of the euro that its states, just like
other countries, are indebted. It is stupid to maintain that
member states who agreed the 750 billion euro promise have
fatally shot the euro. Actually, they have found normality.""
 ""At the time, politics dictated that something came together
that did not fit economically. A comparison with German
reunification is appropriate...things won't be so economically
comfortable for the Germans from now on, just as West Germans
aren't as comfortable as they were before reunification.
 ""It is more important what happens in the next few days than
what happened on Sunday night. Will it succeed in agreeing
rules, just as there were financial rules for the East and West
when they were growing together?.. Will Angela Merkel's Germany
find its role next to the crowing France of Nicolas Sarkozy?
 ""Above all, how seriously and sustainably will the indebted
countries consolidate their state finances. And also: what
incentives for growth will they have? If all this works,
financial markets will get involved and must not fear for the
euro.""
 DIE WELT (centre-right)
 Comment from Joerg Eigendorf
 ""Let us imagine that Angela Merkel had stood firm in the
night until Monday. The chancellor would have said no to the
desires of European neighbours to dig a grave for the
independence of the European Central Bank. And she would have
insisted on strengthening the stability pact.
 ""You wouldn't even want to imagine what would have happened
then. It is quite possible that such a steadfast position would
have meant the end of the euro. The consequence would have been
chaos in the whole of Europe. And we Germans would have been
once again guilty.
 ""Precisely that shows the dilemma that Chancellor Merkel and
Germany are caught up in. We cannot push through our culture of
stability in Europe. Germany stood practically alone in the
night to Monday when the rescue of the euro was being debated.
The euro zone is dominated by countries for whom currency
stability is not so important. And leading the opposition is
President Nicolas Sarkozy, whom the weakened chancellor could
little oppose. With a devastating result: what seemed yesterday
set into stone is today no longer valid. Nothing symbolises that
more strongly than the loss of the central bank's independence.
The power division between monetary and financial policy in
Europe is history.
 ""It becomes ever more difficult to believe in the euro
project. If the government leaders draw the appropriate lessons
from this crisis, then this community of destiny could still
become a stable currency union. The condition for this however
would be a fundamental change of attitude in all the countries.
More probable is that politicians will fail to breathe deeply
and take strict budget deficit cutting measures and the
consequent reforms of the stability pact. Then even the 750
billion euros would soon no longer be sufficient. Therefore
nothing has been won with the rescue package, except for some
time. No one can say how much.""
 
 FINANCIAL TIMES DEUTSCHLAND (Business)
""The wording in the Lisbon Treaty -- no State was liable for
the debts of another -- has been reinterpreted as a ""no-bailout
clause"" and brought to the people.""
 ""The German government and parliament are legally free to
support Greece, Malta or even Kyrgyzstan. The current
orientation of German European Union and its debt policy is
wrong and unsustainable, but that unfortunately doesn't mean
that the new policy solves the problem.""
 ""The newly found solution consists of a separate debt fund
for EU countries, a credit line that is guaranteed by the more
creditworthy countries. All that should mitigate the problem at
first, but it won't make it disappear. Especially since the
whole programme comes with restrictive austerity policies for
the countries whose access to capital markets is closed. In sum,
the problem deepens the economic crisis. One can only hope that
the protests in Athens, Thessaloniki and Patras are so severe
that the Greek government comes clean on their inability to pay.
However, a Greek bankruptcy would entail enormous costs and
sacrifices for the people. Such a solution will be avoided for
as long as possible, in part because it is against the banks,
insurers and savers, and keeping these three groups clear of the
financial disaster is the government's highest priority.""

 * IMF: No need for radical measures to stem rouble rally yet
 * Deputy PM: rules for long-term investment should be eased

 (Adds quotes, Shuvalov's comments, background)
 By Lidia Kelly and Carolyn Cohn
 MOSCOW/LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Russia should be ready to
defend its markets from excessive capital inflows, although for
now there is no need to implement any radical measures, the
International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.
 Separately, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov
said that the government should ease rules for investors willing
to keep their money in Russia for more than three years.
 The IMF urged Russia in a published report to consider all
macroeconomic and prudential measures to prevent surfeit of
capital inflows, not excepting capital controls.
 ""Russia should keep an open mind on capital controls, at
least as a temporary measure should large inflows once again
become a threat to macroeconomic and financial stability,"" the
IMF said in the Regional Economic Outlook report.
 Odd Per Brekk, the IMF's senior Russia representative,
softened the tone of the report, however, saying the rouble is
broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals and for now
there is no need to stem its rally with radical policies.
 ""Absent any further substantial appreciation, we don't see a
basis for taking extraordinary steps at this stage to prevent
further rouble appreciation,"" Per Brekk told journalists in
Moscow.
 The rouble has rallied to its highest level since late 2008
against both the euro  and the euro-dollar basket
, bolstered by high oil prices, a recovering economy
and investor appetite for high-yielding emerging markets.
 Per Brekk noted that Russia had capital outflows in the
first quarter, and that it had available a whole series of
softer measures to prevent excessive inflows, among them
changing minimum reserve requirements. [ID:nLDE6310FK]
 
 LESSONS TO LEARN
 The pre-crisis pattern of capital inflows offer crucial
lessons for Europe's emerging market economies, the IMF said in
its report.
 ""Managing capital inflows remains a crucial challenge across
all countries, with policymakers asking how to ensure a healthy
level of foreign investment, how to prevent excesses, and how to
improve the stability of an increasingly integrated
international financial sector,"" the Fund said.
 Russia has been increasingly focusing on implementing
measures that would attract long-term funds.
 In London on Tuesday, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor
Shuvalov said that Russia should ease rules this year and create
more privileged status for serious investors.
 ""The longer-period loan they provide, the smaller reserve
they use,"" Shuvalov told reporters. ""If it's short money, then
the reserves will be higher, the final interest rate will be
high, you won't be able to play with just exchange rate and
inflation.""
 Capital inflows, along with high commodity prices, stood
behind the rouble's rise during Russia's pre-crisis boom years.
But once the crisis hit the country, capital inflows reversed,
fleeing Russia instantaneously and resulting in the rouble's
managed but rapid depreciation.
 However, Russia's officials have ruled out a return to
strict capital controls and the country has already taken some
steps to curb speculative inflows, including lowering interest
rates and allowing greater flexibility in the rouble's rate.
 ""Capital controls could be part of the short-term response,""
Per Brekk said. ""But one should be realistic about the
effectiveness of capital controls over time.""

 ISTANBUL, May 11 (Reuters) - Turkey's current account
deficit widened sharply to $4.322 billion in March, the central
bank said on Tuesday, exceeding forecasts and reflecting growing
demand in the major emerging market economy.
 The data gave more evidence of the economic recovery from
last year's recession after figures on Monday showed industrial
output climbed by a fifth in March from the previous year.
 The deficit, an economic weak spot for Turkey in times of
expansion, more than trebled from $1.179 billion a year earlier
and was in excess of a $3.9 billion Reuters poll prediction.
 The foreign trade deficit surged 189.6 percent in March to
$3.562 billion.
 There was little sign of market reaction to the data.
 The revival in domestic demand and rising energy costs are
expected to drive a doubling of this year's current account
deficit from its relatively low level in 2009, when it shrank
66.5 percent.
 Turkey imports the vast majority of its energy needs and raw
materials. 
 In the first quarter of the year the deficit widened to
$9.951 billion from $1.979 billion a year earlier.
 Forecasts for March's deficit in a Reuters poll were in a
range of $3.35 billion to $4.1 billion, while the median
forecast for 2010 was $28 billion.
 Turkey's official GDP growth projection for 2010 is 3.5
percent, but economists say expansion could reach 5 percent.

 (Adds more detail, analyst)
 BUDAPEST, May 11 (Reuters) - Hungarian inflation ticked
lower in April, data showed on Tuesday, and analysts see it
falling substantially in the second half of 2010 as the impact
of tax hikes abates, posing no risk to further monetary easing.
 Headline inflation dropped to 5.7 percent in April from 5.9
percent in March, the Central Statistics Office (KSH) said. The
figure came in a touch above analysts' median forecast for an
increase of 5.6 percent.
 Analysts said further interest rate cuts by the central bank
-- which has been cutting its key base rate continuously since
last July -- would hinge on market sentiment and the risk
assessment of Hungarian assets.
 ""Fuel prices increased again in April and this trend may
continue as fuel prices are set to rise further this week,
although much depends on what will happen in the weeks ahead,""
said KSH statistician Beata Kollar.
 ""Food prices also increased this month but this is a
seasonal phenomenon and is likely to occur again in the May
data.""
 Core consumer prices, calculated without volatile food and
fuel prices, rose by 4.3 percent year-on-year, while the pace of
monthly price growth eased to 0.5 percent from 0.7 percent in
March.
 Inflation is expected to fall sharply from the second half
of the year when the impact of last year's consumption tax hikes
aimed at boosting budget revenues fades, bringing price growth
closer to the central bank's 3 percent medium-term target.
 The bank has cut interest rates in 10 successive steps by
425 basis points to a record low of 5.25 percent by April.
Analysts expect one more rate cut to 5 percent by the end of the
year.
 ""We still expect that there will be a rate cut but it may be
delayed by 1-2 months as the central bank may want to wait for a
calmer period on markets,"" said Gergely Suppan at Takarekbank.
 The central bank will publish its quarterly update on
inflation at its next policy meeting this month.
 Central bank Governor Andras Simor said on Sunday that
Hungary's current inflation path does not necessitate stricter
monetary conditions, including a stronger currency.

hit because of political uncertainty, but London should not rely
on EU help if it suffers a financial crisis, the head of the
French financial markets watchdog said on Tuesday.
 Jean-Pierre Jouyet, who was European affairs minister from
2007-2008, told Europe 1 radio that Britain's refusal to sign up
to a $1 trillion package to stabilise the euro showed that the
European Union had now fragmented into three distinct groups.
 ""There is not a two speed Europe but a three speed Europe.
You have Europe of the euro, Europe of the countries that
understand the euro ... and you have the English,"" he said.
 ""The English are very certainly going to be targeted given
the political difficulties they have. Help yourself and heaven
will help you. If you don't want to show solidarity to the euro
zone, then let's see what happens to the United Kingdom,"" he
added.
 A British parliamentary election last week failed to produce
an outright winner and the two main rival political parties are
trying to woo the smaller Liberal Democrats to agree a
power-sharing deal.
 Against this backdrop of political uncertainty, London told
its EU partners at the weekend that it would not provide support
for the euro, which has been battered by the Greek debt crisis.
 The move clearly irritated some French officials, who have
been quick to point out that both Poland and Sweden, which are
not in the euro zone, agreed to help finance a 60-billion-euro
stabilisation fund for euro zone states in difficulty.

(Adds more comments, detail, background)
 BUDAPEST, May 11 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank has
committed serious policy mistakes as it has focused only on
inflation and the members of the Monetary Council should resign,
incoming Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy was quoted on Tuesday
as saying.
 The centre-right Fidesz party which won elections last month
and will form Hungary's next government has stepped up criticism
of the bank and its governor since the elections, but it was the
first time a top Fidesz policy maker called on the Monetary
Council to resign.
 Matolcsy told daily Nepszabadsag the bank has made mistakes
since the summer of 2003 as it has allowed foreign currency
borrowing to spread and concentrated only on curbing inflation.
 ""The balance between central bank objectives has been upset
since October 2008. They only focused on fighting inflation and
they lost the battle,"" Matolcsy said in an interview.
 ""The National Bank of Hungary has committed serious
professional mistakes and it seems it has not learned from
these.""
 When asked if members of the Monetary Council should draw
the consequences and should resign, Matolcsy said:
 ""Yes, that's what I think.""
 Matolcsy, who will head a new economic policy power centre
in the new government, also said Hungary's economy could grow
this year by 0.5-1 percent if the government starts implementing
its three-year tax cut programme from July and cuts bureaucracy.
 Analysts expect the economy to stagnate this year .
 Matolcsy said Fidesz wanted to shift the tax burden from
taxing incomes to consumption and would not reduce the top value
added tax rate from 25 percent before 2013.
 ""In the three-year tax programme we must achieve that the
focus should shift from incomes to consumption,"" he said.
 ""It is for certain that until the European Union and the
Hungarian economy starts growing in a palpable way -- which we
expect in 2013 -- we cannot reduce the top 25 percent rate.""
 Matolcsy reiterated that this year's budget deficit would
probably exceed the target of 3.8 percent of GDP.
 He said he expected the new government to be able to agree
with the International Monetary Fund and the EU on a budget
deficit of 5 to 6 percent of gross domestic product for this
year.

record clip, showing that the government still has its work cut
out to keep the world's third-largest economy from boiling
over.
 However, a slowdown in money growth and industrial output
signalled that incremental tightening measures have started to
bite, justifying Beijing's cautious approach thus far to
tamping down on economic activity.
 But analysts said that higher interest rates and a
resumption of yuan appreciation -- tightening steps that the
government has so far resisted -- should be on the policy menu
in coming months.
 Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent in the year to April,
topping forecasts for a 2.7 percent rise and the highest since
October 2008.
 ""Rising inflation is a serious problem, but it's more of an
indication of where CPI is heading that is more important than
this 2.8 percent,"" said Dong Tao, an economist with Credit
Suisse in Hong Kong.
 ""This probably will not result in an immediate rate hike,
but the central bank is getting increasingly nervous of
negative real interest rates,"" he added.
 The main stock index in Shanghai finished down 1.9 percent,
with investors unsettled by the inflation outlook.
 Worries that China will intensify its monetary tightening
also served as a drag on global oil prices.
 YUAN SIGNAL
 A central bank adviser, Xia Bin, said that China had
signalled this week that it was ready to let the yuan move more
freely when it said it would manage its exchange rate ""with
reference to a basket of currencies"".
 The comments were seen as representing his personal views
and not necessarily reflective of official thinking.
 The latest batch of economic data underscored why many
analysts believe that Beijing will allow only faint
appreciation even after it releases the yuan from its de facto
dollar peg, which has been in place since mid-2008.
 Inflation was driven by food prices, which rose 5.9 percent
in the year to April, while core pressures remained relatively
subdued, with non-food prices up 1.3 percent.
 Although new bank lending was stronger than expected last
month at 774 billion yuan ($113 billion), the broad M2 measure
of money growth slowed to 21.5 percent year on year, the
slowest since early 2009.
 And China just narrowly notched up a trade surplus in
April, according to numbers published on Monday.
 ""Provided that financial markets stabilise in the next few
weeks, we expect China to start the yuan move within the next
couple of months,"" UBS economist Wang Tao said.
 China has been working to gradually normalise its monetary
stance after flooding the economy with cash last year.
 The People's Bank of China has raised banks' required
reserves three times this year and stepped up drainage of cash
via open market operations, while regulators have given banks
strict orders to rein in issuance of loans.
 In contrast to regional neighbours such as India, Malaysia
and Australia, China has so far eschewed the blunter instrument
of raising rates, not least because Beijing harbours doubts
about the solidity of the global recovery and has an eye on the
all-important property market.
 PROPERTY WORRIES
 Chinese property prices jumped 12.8 percent in April from a
year earlier, the fastest pace in the five-year history of the
government's main housing market survey. Economists believe the
official figures understate the extent of price rises,
especially in major cities.
 Memories of how over-tightening led to a property collapse
in 2008 would deter the government from making more aggressive
moves to slow economic activity, said Tom Orlik, an economist
with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Beijing.
 ""China's leaders will likely want to see how the targeted
measures play out, before following up with an increase in
interest rates,"" he wrote in a note.
 Surprising on the downside, industrial output dipped to
17.8 percent year-on-year growth in April. Economists had
expected a rise of 18.5 percent.
 However, Brian Jackson, an economist with Royal Bank of
Canada in Hong Kong, warned that the government could not
afford to delay lending rate increases and moderate yuan
appreciation for too long.
 ""The risk Beijing faces is that its preference to fine-tune
policy and avoid broader tightening until domestic and global
uncertainties ease may allow price pressures to build to
damaging levels,"" he said.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday, giving up
some of its gains made the previous day on news of a $1 trillion
package to prevent the spread of the European debt crisis, as
scepticism remains over Greece's ability to cut its large fiscal
deficit smoothly.
 Political uncertainty put pressure on sterling as Britain's
two big rival political parties planned to resume courting the
Liberal Democrats after Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he would
step aside to try to keep his Labour Party in power.
[ID:nLDE6492UW]
 ""The emergency package is likely to ask Greece to adopt very
demanding steps to cut its debt, raising doubts over whether it
will be able to implement such budget reforms,"" said Tsutomu
Soma, senior manager of the foreign securities department at
Okasan Securities.
 ""The emergency package is effective in avoiding a near-term
crisis. But much uncertainty remains for the euro zone.""
 Moody's Investors Service on Monday said it may still
downgrade Portugal, and Greece's rating could fall to as low as
junk grade. [ID:nN10227186]
 Against the dollar, the euro stood at $1.2744 , down
0.3 percent from late U.S. trade on Monday, having returned to
levels seen before the rescue scheme was announced.
 The euro fell 0.9 percent to 118.15 yen , a day
after jumping over 2 percent versus the Japanese currency.
 European Union finance ministers, central bankers and the
International Monetary Fund hammered out an emergency package
that was the largest in over two years, since G20 leaders rolled
out support for the world economy following the collapse of
Lehman Brothers in 2008. [ID:nSGE6490HH]
 Following the announcement of the plan, the euro initially
surged to near $1.31, rebounding from a 14-month trough of
$1.2510 hit on trading platform EBS last week as investors had
feared a sovereign credit crisis could spread from Greece to
other euro zone countries.
 ""The rally in the euro was short-lived despite the massive
rescue measures,"" said Tohru Sasaki, head of FX strategy at
JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. ""The euro's weakness is striking.""
 Traders said the euro is likely to move in a $1.25-$1.31
range in the near term.
 The dollar was down 0.6 percent at 92.73 yen . Traders
said the yen was helped by Japanese exporters selling other
currencies.
 The yen also got a lift from a Reuters report quoting sources
familiar with the matter as saying Mizuho Financial Group Inc
<8411.T>, Japan's second-largest bank, plans to issue about $8.7
billion of common shares. [ID:nTOE6490A6]
 The yen's climb picked up pace as stocks slipped into
negative territory in Asia, prompting investors to reduce risks.
 The Australian dollar slid 1.2 percent to 83.28 yen
 after surging over 3 percent on Monday.
 MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.8
percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS> after climbing 3.4 percent on Monday for
its biggest single-day percentage gain since May 2009.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> was down 0.9 percent. [.T]
 Sterling inched down 0.1 percent to $1.4842 . It hit
a one-year low of $1.4475 late last week on concerns about the
formation of a new government following last week's inconclusive
election.
 A batch of figures released on Tuesday showed China's economy
was in robust health but not overheating as some have feared,
with analysts saying the data could justify Beijing's gradual
approach to tightening so far this year. [ID:nTOE64A01U]

in Europe continued to draw investors' attention, traders said.

 * Countries that can must continue with stimuli
 * Exports must be balanced with stronger internal demand
(Adds quotes, background)
 MILAN/FRANKFURT, May 11 (Reuters) - Italy and France must
step up fiscal consolidation efforts, the European Union's
monetary affairs chief Olli Rehn was quoted as saying in
newspaper interviews published on Tuesday.
 ""Italy finds itself in a different situation from other
countries because it hasn't distributed massive budget stimuli.
But it has a very high debt, and the dynamic of that has to be
put under control,"" Rehn said in an interview with Il Sole 24
Ore newspaper.
 ""In Italy, the process of public accounts consolidation must
be intensified,"" he said.
 In a separate interview with German daily Handelsblatt, Rehn
reiterated that Italy must step up its consolidation efforts,
adding: ""That goes for France as well.""
 Rehn said the European Commission's assessment of budget
drafts, before being debated on national levels, must become a
part of a planned strengthening of European budget rules.
 He said EU finance ministers would discuss proposals for
changes to the system at a meeting on Monday.
 Italy cut its economic growth outlook and raised its debt
forecasts last week, before a weekend EU-IMF agreement on a $1
trillion emergency package to stabilize the euro zone.
[ID:nLDE6451WR]
 The Economy Ministry said the primary budget balance would
be improved by a total of 1.6 percent of gross domestic product
with measures worth 0.8 percent in 2011 and the same in 2012.
 The Italian government is likely to bring forward to this
month budget correction measures worth some 25 billion euros to
fulfil its 2011-2012 deficit-cutting targets, a source closed to
the matter said on Monday. [ID:nTST002282]
 Rehn said Spain and Portugal also needed to consolidate
budgets urgently and beyond these, ""there are other countries
that need to take new measures"".
 ""I am expecting, therefore, that all euro zone (countries)
will tell the Eurogroup on Monday what they plan in concrete
terms,"" he said.
 ""You have to find the right balance between exit strategies
from budget imbalances and reinforcing economic growth. Whoever
has the space must continue with stimuli,"" Rehn said, citing
Germany as an example.
 Rehn said Europe as a whole risked weak growth if countries
failed to stimulate internal demand even though their exports
were strong.
 ""No one wants to weaken great performances on the export
front. But that has to be balanced otherwise there will always
be weak economic growth not just in the south of Euro land but
in the whole European Union.""

1368,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2010 01:44AM ET</span>",Japan corp pension funds shift out of stocks -data," TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japanese corporate pension funds
have reduced their exposure to domestic shares for the fourth
straight year due to the poor performance of the asset class,
data from an industry body showed.
 Their weightings in Japanese stocks fell to 17.1 percent in
the year ended March 31 from 17.5 percent a year earlier.
Exposures in the asset class almost halved from 35.3 percent in
the financial year to March 2006, the Pension Fund Association
data showed.
 Japanese corporate pension funds have been reducing their
exposure to risk assets, including Japanese equities, as they
have lowered their targeted returns, fund managers said.
 Their exposure to domestic stocks lost value due to the slump
in Japanese stocks over the past few years, and they were also
hit by the financial crisis after the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008.
 A separate survey compiled by JP Morgan Asset Management also
showed corporate pension funds on average held 20.2 percent of
their investment funds in domestic equities at the end of March,
down from 22.5 percent the previous year.
 However, the strength of Japanese and global shares since
last year has helped corporate pension funds to produce a
positive investment return for the first time in three years, the
association data showed.
 Corporate pensions produced a return of plus 17.84 percent in
2009/10, a sharp turnaround from minus 18.34 percent a year
earlier, the association data showed.
 The outstanding asset value jumped 14 percent to 10.57
trillion yen ($113.3 billion) as of the end of the March from the
previous year.
 While pension funds lowered exposures in Japanese stocks,
they raised weightings in foreign equities to 25.4 percent in
2009/10 from 21.5 percent in the previous year, while weightings
in real estate rose to 0.6 percent from 0.2 percent.
 Weightings in domestic bonds fell to 36.7 percent from 39.9
percent and foreign bonds eased to 20.2 percent from 20.9
percent.

investors into investment trust funds jumped 74 percent to $4.9
billion in April as investors piled into global high-yield bond
funds and other funds, research data shows.
 The value of initial launches of investment trusts, similar
to mutual funds and known as ""toushin"", rose to 452.7 billion yen
($4.9 billion), the highest monthly level since September 2006
when it reached 456.2 billion yen, data by Thomson Reuters fund
research company Lipper showed.
 The number of funds rose to 45 in April, up five from the
previous month when inflows fell for the first time in three
months.
 Japanese individuals, who hold $15 trillion in personal
assets, have in general become more willing to chase returns by
investing in emerging markets and other high-yielding instruments
especially as the global economy has stabilised.
 Investment trust funds that invest in global high-yield bonds
set up by Japan's top fund manager Nomura Asset Management
attracted the biggest amount of funds from retail investors,
totalling more than $2 billion.
 Nomura Asset's high-yield bond funds drew strong demand as
investors were able to select the type of currencies they prefer,
including a basket of resource-linked currencies such as the
Brazilian real and the Australian dollar as well as a basket of
Asian currencies such as the Chinese yuan and the Indonesian
rupiah.
 Separately, Nomura Asset launched trust funds that invest in
shares related to smart grid technologies that drew more than 110

 In addition, a fund of Nissay Asset Management, a unit of

 TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - A massive relief rally in
financial markets on news of a $1 trillion deal to resolve
Europe's debt crisis fizzled on Tuesday on nagging doubts about
how Greece and other debt-laden euro zone countries will reduce
their budget deficits.
 Asian stocks fell more than 1 percent and European shares
looked set to follow, with financial bookmakers expecting
bourses in London, Frankfurt and Paris to open as much as 1.8
percent lower.
 U.S. stock futures fell 0.9 percent, with early losses
accelerating heading into the European market open.
 The euro, which had initially surged on the news of the
weekend package put together by EU finance ministers, central
bankers and the IMF, eased on Tuesday and was well off its
Monday high as investors grew cautious.
 The single currency dipped 0.6 percent to $1.2705 by early
afternoon from late U.S. levels on Monday.
 The rescue package, together with a pledge from the
European Central Bank to buy government bonds, helped ease
worries that Greece's debt problems would engulf other weak
countries in Europe and spark another global credit crisis.
 In response, markets soared worldwide. Stocks in fiscally
weak Greece, Spain and Portugal jumped by double digits and
their risk premiums on their debt tumbled against benchmark
German bunds. Wall Street racked up its biggest one-day gain in
more than a year.
 But while the safety net may have eased fears of a Greek
debt default in the near term, longer-term concerns remained
over whether Greece and other euro zone countries with large
fiscal deficits will be able to deliver on tough fiscal
austerity measures and avoid debt restructuring.
 Moreover, the crisis has highlighted deep-rooted political
divisions and structural economic problems across the
16-country euro zone and broader European Union.
 ""Even though one of the worst scenarios -- a Greek default
-- has been avoided for now, in many ways solving the bigger
problems have simply been postponed and new issues could emerge
in places such as Portugal and Spain,"" said Nagayuki Yamagishi,
a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.4 percent after its
biggest jump in five months on Monday, while South Korean
shares slipped 0.4 percent.
 Market players said profit-taking weighed on equities
following Monday's sharp rally, with foreign selling picking
up.
 In Korea, foreign investors were sellers of a net 29.1
billion won ($25.71 million) worth of shares. Foreign orders
placed before the open of Tokyo trade showed foreign investors
had also been set to sell for a fourth straight day.
 Investors in Asia also kept a close eye on economic reports
from China for any clues on whether authorities will ramp-up
policy tightening measures in coming weeks, potentially
dampening corporate profits.
 Data on Tuesday showed China's inflation rate rose to an

 Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager for Ichiyoshi

"
1372,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2010 11:36PM ET</span>",Greek debt sustainable but plenty of risks - IMF," WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - The International Monetary
Fund said on Monday that Greece's public debt is sustainable
over the medium term but persistent low growth, or even a
moderate economic jolt, could set back the euro zone country.
 Under a baseline scenario, Greece's public debt could peak
at 149 percent of gross domestic product in 2013 and decline
gradually to 120 percent in 2020, an IMF staff paper published
late on Monday said.
 In 2009 it reached 115 percent.
 The staff report said the increase in Greece's debt levels
reflects ""continued large deficits of the public sector, which
would drop to 4.6 percent of GDP by 2013, low growth and
deflation.""
 The report offers the first comprehensive insights of the
IMF's analysis of Greece's debt crisis, which prompted a
historic 110 billion euro EU-IMF bailout for the country
earlier this month and a further 750 billion euro ($1 trillion)
emergency package on Monday to keep Athens' problems from
engulfing other euro zone countries and sparking another global
crisis.
 The IMF officially approved its portion of the earlier
bailout money, about 30 billion euros, on Sunday along with a
three-year economic program for Greece that envisages deep
spending cuts and revenue increases.
 Financial markets have been highly sceptical that Greece
can meet those targets amid fierce public opposition to tough
austerity measures, which are likely to weaken the economy even
further. But analysts believe the latest emergency package has
at least bought the EU some time, easing concerns that Athens
could default on its debt in the near term. [ID:nSGE6490HH]
 The IMF said its debt estimate assumes that the primary
balance will improve to 6 percent of GDP by 2014 and beyond,
from -8.6 percent of GDP in 2009.
 IMF staff forecast output will contract by 4 percent in
2010-2011 and growth will reach 2.75 percent after 2015.
 The report said while Greece's average maturity of the debt
is relatively high and there are large rollover needs in the
next three to five years, the average remaining maturity of the
general government debt is eight years.
 More than one-third of the debt stock will mature in the
next three years and almost half will mature in the next five
years, it said.
 It said of Greece's total government debt, 98.5 percent is
denominated in euro and 89 percent is fixed-rate debt.
 The IMF noted that a 1 percentage point reduction in
Greece's growth rate each year could increase debt to around
166 percent of GDP by 2020. But faster growth by 1 percentage
point could lower debt levels to 80 percent of GDP by 2020.
 Meanwhile, if interest rates were to go up by 200 basis
points they would increase Greece's public debt to 131 percent
of GDP by 2020, the IMF added.
 The IMF staff said it could take time before market
confidence in Greece is restored and estimated that the
authorities have 1 to 2 years to build a track record before
they need to return to the market.
 Staff said while the Greek government was fully committed
to meeting targets under the IMF program, there were also ample
risks.
 ""Fiscal adjustment and the resumption of growth are
expected to offer powerful assistance to place the debt on a
declining path from 2013 onwards,"" the paper said.
 ""That said, there are also substantial risks to the
program. Restoring competitiveness through internal price
adjustment while implementing fiscal consolidation is very
challenging, and the margin to respond to negative shocks is
limited at this early stage,"" it added.
 The report said Greece's access to private capital markets
in 2012 and later may be more constrained, and tackling the
country's deep fiscal problems required strong political will
and public support.
 It said while the government were making strong efforts to
address data shortcomings, ""the accuracy and reliability of
fiscal and national accounts data remain a concern"".

 * Industrial output up 17.8 pct y/y (f'cast 18.5 pct)
 * Pressure building but still early to raise rates -analysts
 By Aileen Wang and Lee Chyen Yee
 BEIJING, May 11 (Reuters) - Chinese inflation edged up to an 18-month high
in April and bank lending topped expectations, but the full suite of monthly
data showed an economy that was in robust health and not overheating as some
have feared.
 The confirmation of what some analysts have called China's Goldilocks
scenario -- not too hot, not too cold -- could justify Beijing's gradual
approach to tightening so far this year.
 Higher interest rates and a resumption of yuan appreciation are still on the
policy menu, but the government will proceed cautiously in implementing both,
analysts said.
 Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent in the year to April, above forecasts for a
2.7 percent rise and the highest since October 2008.
 ""Rising inflation is a serious problem, but it's more of an indication of
where CPI is heading that is more important than this 2.8 percent,"" said Dong
Tao, an economist with Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.
 ""This probably will not result in an immediate rate hike, but the central
bank is getting increasingly nervous of negative real interest rates,"" he added.
 Bank lending was also strong, with 774 billion yuan ($113.4 billion) in new
local-currency loans issued last month, compared with forecasts of 570 billion
yuan.
 But surprising on the downside, industrial output dipped to 17.8 percent
year-on-year growth. Economists had expected a rise of 18.5 percent.

 EASY DOES IT
 Tom Orlik, an economist with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in
Beijing, said that memories of how over-tightening led to a property collapse in
2008 would deter the government from making more aggressive moves to slow
economic activity.
 ""China's leaders will likely want to see how the targeted measures play out,
before following up with an increase in interest rates,"" he wrote in a note.
 Global uncertainties, particularly sovereign debt worries in Europe, will
also feed into their calculus.
 ""With the Greek cloud still casting a shadow over the prospects for external
demand, Beijing has little incentive to accelerate the tightening schedule,""
Orlik said.
 Data on Monday showed that China returned to familiar territory by posting a
trade surplus in April, but exports only narrowly topped imports, providing
limited comfort for policymakers fearful of another round of global economic
turmoil. [ID:nTOE649026]
 The People's Bank of China has raised banks' required reserves three times
this year and stepped up drainage of cash via open market operations, while
regulators have given banks strict orders to rein in their issuance of loans.
 In contrast to regional neighbours such as India, Malaysia and Australia,
China has so far eschewed the blunter instrument of higher borrowing costs, not
least because Beijing harbours doubts about the solidity of the global recovery
and has an eye on the all-important property market.
 In practice, China has been gradually normalising its monetary stance after
it pumped an extraordinary flood of cash into the economy last year to power it
through the global slump.
 In the recent words of deputy central bank chief Hu Xiaolian, the policy
emphasis is now on ""appropriately"", not ""easy"".
 As ginger as the tightening has been, the impact on the stock market has
been profound. The main Shanghai index <.SSEC> has fallen nearly 22 percent
since August of last year.

 * Wording change means yuan to move -PBoC adviser
 * PBoC referred to ""basket"" in monetary policy report
 * Economists disagree about significance of wording
(adds quotes, economists, background)
 BEIJING, May 11 (Reuters) - China signalled that it was ready to let the
yuan move more freely when it said it would manage the currency ""with reference
to a basket of currencies,"" a central bank adviser said in remarks published on
Tuesday.
 The People's Bank of China (PBoC) said on Monday in a monetary policy report
that it would improve the yuan's managed float based on market supply and
demand, while adjusting the exchange rate with reference to a basket of
currencies. [ID:nTOE64909T]
 ""The change means the yuan currency is going to move,"" PBoC adviser Xia Bin
told the China Business News.
 China has held the yuan steady at about 6.83 to the dollar since mid-2008,
in an attempt to cushion the economy from the global financial crisis.
 As one of three academic advisers on the PBoC's monetary policy committee,
Xia has knowledge of central bank thinking, but his comments represent his
personal views, not official policy.
 Although the basket wording is not new -- it has been used since 2005 -- it
had disappeared from the previous quarterly monetary policy reports by the
central bank, but reappeared in the latest version.
 ""The yuan formation mechanism will return to the principle of referencing a
basket of currencies as decided by the currency reform. This change is coming,""
Xia said.
 SIGNIFICANCE UNDER DISPUTE
 Morgan Stanley economist Qing Wang also interpreted the reference to a
basket as a significant change in wording, indicating that yuan appreciation
might resume this summer.
 But Mark Williams, an economist with Capital Economics in London, cautioned
against reading too much into the central bank's phrasing.
 For one thing, the central bank's description of policy regularly changes,
and these changes have rarely provided solid clues about the direction of policy
making, he said.
 For another, the central bank is just one voice -- and a relatively weak one
-- in setting yuan policy.
 ""The views of the People's Bank are not the last word on exchange rate or
monetary policy. That still comes from the State Council,"" Williams said in a
note to clients.
 Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, said in March that
as the government wound down the stimulus measures implemented at the height of
the financial crisis, ""the special yuan policy"" would end ""sooner or later"".

 * Euro seen moving in $1.25-$1.31 range in near-term
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Tuesday, giving
back some gains made the previous day on news of a $1 trillion
package to prevent the spread of the European debt crisis, as
scepticism remains over Greece's ability to cut its large fiscal
deficit smoothly.
 The euro slid 0.6 percent to 118.44 yen, a day after jumping
over 2 percent versus the Japanese currency. Against the dollar,
the euro stood at $1.2770, down 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade
on Monday.
 ""The emergency package is likely to ask Greece to adopt very
demanding steps to cut its debt, leaving us with doubts over
whether it will be able to implement such budget reform,"" said
Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the foreign securities department
at Okasan Securities.
 ""The emergency package is effective in avoiding a near-term
crisis. But so much uncertainty remains for the euro zone.""
 European Union financial ministers, central bankers and the
International Monetary Fund hammered out an emergency package
that was the largest in over two years since G20 leaders rolled
out support for the world economy following the 2008 collapse of
Lehman Brothers.
 Following the announcement of the plan, the euro initially
surged to near $1.31, rebounding from a 14-month trough of
$1.2510 hit on trading platform EBS last week as investors had
feared a sovereign credit crisis could spread from Greece to
other euro zone countries.
 Traders said the euro is likely to move in a $1.25-$1.31
range in the near-term.
 The dollar was down 0.6 percent at 92.78 yen.

 * Global stock markets rally after huge EU-IMF rescue plan
 * Euro rises broadly as central banks buy local govt debt
 * Oil jumps to near $77 a barrel on emergency rescue deal
 * Bonds plunge as $1 trillion rescue hammers safe-havens
(Updates with close of U.S. markets)
 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Global equity markets staged a
massive relief rally on Monday after officials agreed to a $1
trillion emergency rescue package to halt a festering sovereign
debt crisis in Europe from engulfing the rest of the world.
 The euro rose broadly after the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund carved out an emergency rescue
package of up to 750 billion euros ($1 trillion) to keep
Greece's debt crisis from spreading through the euro zone.
 The price of oil and other commodities surged as the rescue
deal stoked investors' appetite for riskier assets, and
safe-havens like bonds tumbled as the aversion to risk eased.
 The equities rally began in Asia after EU and IMF officials
announced the deal and then caught fire around the world as
other markets opened. European shares rose at their fastest
clip in more than 17 months, while the S&P 500 posted its
biggest percentage and point gain at the open since at least
the late 1960s.
 U.S. stocks finished the day with the best one-day gain in
more than a year.
 The European aid package was the biggest government rescue
since the Group of 20 leaders moved to stabilize markets after
the Lehman Brothers collapse in September 2008 led the U.S.
recession to spread worldwide and sent markets plunging.
[ID:nLDE64900T]
 ""This could've been another situation like when Bear
Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed, but the rescue plan shows
how serious Europe is about preventing that,"" said Alan Lancz,
president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates, an investment advisory
firm in Toledo, Ohio.
 Banks ranked among the top beneficiaries as the huge
bailout reduced fears of a possible default. The STOXX Europe
600 banking index <.SX7P> jumped 14 percent after a drop last
week by the same magnitude.
 On Wall Street, the S&P Financial index <.GSPF> climbed 5.6
percent and was the top gainer among S&P sectors.
 A global measure of world equity performance gained almost
5 percent, while markets in Italy, Spain and Portugal climbed
more than 10 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 404.71
points, or 3.90 percent, at 10,785.14. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 48.85 points, or 4.40 percent, at
1,159.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 109.03
points, or 4.81 percent, at 2,374.67.
 But questions about how the plan will work knocked the euro
off its high for the day near $1.31, after having rebounded
from a 14-month low near $1.25 hit last week when markets
feared the debt crisis in Greece would spread to other euro
zone countries.
 By late afternoon the euro  was below $1.28, not far
from its level late Friday, before the bailout was announced.
 ""We're still not sure how some of the funding will work,
and I don't think this addresses the core problem: Greece's
debt trajectory is still by any measure unsustainable,"" said
Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
in New York.
 The rescue package was on the scale of the $700 billion
Troubled Asset Relief Program launched by the United States to
fend off the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression.
 In addition, there were measures by central banks to
address funding strains and a European Central Bank plan to buy
the region's government bonds. [ID:nLDE6450VF]
 A number of European central banks said they had already
started. [nLDE649051]
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
4.8 percent, while its emerging market index <.MSCIEF> gained
4.4 percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed up 7.4
percent at 1,038.91, the biggest one-day percentage gain since
November 2008.
 U.S. crude for June delivery  settled up $1.69, or
2.25 percent, at $76.80 a barrel.
 The euro  was up 1.07 percent at $1.2792.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.30 percent at 84.198.
 Against the yen, the dollar  was up 1.75 percent at
93.16.
 Gold slipped less than 1 percent, holding relatively firm,
as analysts said the bailout could lead to negative economic
implications and weigh down on the euro in the longer term.
[ID:nLDE64911D]
 U.S. June gold futures  on the COMEX division of the
NYMEX settled down $9.60 at $1,200.80 an ounce.
 In bond markets, the premiums investors demand to buy
peripheral euro zone government bonds rather than German
benchmarks fell.
 Greek bonds were the biggest gainers in the euro zone with
the short-end outperforming, causing the 2/10-year yield curve
to flatten sharply. [ID:nLDE6492F8]
 Liquidity in Greek bonds dried up last week with no trades
going through.
 ""They've attacked this problem from all angles and it's
given a big boost to risk markets at the expense of government
bonds,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA Capital
Markets in Edinburgh.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 33/32 in price to yield 3.54 percent.
 In Asia, Hong Kong shares had their biggest one-day rise in
five months, the MSCI ex-Japan index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 3.4
percent, and Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended up 1.6 percent.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday,
boosted by a $1 trillion rescue designed to stabilize it and
prevent a European debt crisis from spreading, but questions
about how the plan will work knocked it off the day's high.
 The money, which would be available to euro zone countries
that get into financial trouble, amounts to the biggest bailout
since Group of 20 leaders rolled out emergency support for the
world economy following the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.
[ID:nSGE6490HH]
 The euro initially soared above $1.30, rebounding from a
14-month low near $1.25 hit last week as markets feared a debt
crisis in Greece would spread to other euro zone countries,
including Spain and Portugal.
 But concerns lingered about the aid package, including
questions about how quickly aid could be disbursed, and the
currency fell back below $1.28 by late afternoon, not far from
its level late Friday in New York, before the bailout was
announced.
 ""People were heavily positioned against the euro, so we
initially had a huge short-covering rally. But we're still not
sure how some of the funding will work, and I don't think this
addresses the core problem: Greece's debt trajectory is still
by any measure unsustainable,"" said Win Thin, senior currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 After hitting a session high of $1.3093 , the euro
fell to $1.2791, up 0.3 percent on the day. Alan Ruskin, chief
international strategist at RBS Securities, said he still sees
the currency trading in ""the low $1.20s by late summer.""
 Against the yen the euro rose 2 percent to 119.20 yen
 after last week hitting its lowest level since 2001,
while the dollar added 1.8 percent to 93.18 yen . Wall
Street also rallied, and European shares rose at their fastest
pace in more than 17 months.
 Sterling rose 0.5 percent to $1.4872  but retreated
from a session peak above $1.50 after British Prime Minister
Gordon Brown said he would resign as Labour Party leader to
increase the party's chances of forming a new government with
the Liberal Democrats.
 Labour finished second in last week's inconclusive UK
election, and the Liberal Democrats were already in talks with
the poll's top vote-getter, the Conservatives. [ID:nLDE6480O4]
 The pound hit a one-year low of $1.4475 last week for fear
political stalemate will hamper efforts to tackle the UK's
public deficit.
 PRESSURE REMAINS
 The euro is still down 10.5 percent this year, making it
the worst performing major currency, and Moody's Investors
Service on Monday said it may still downgrade Portugal's
investment grade credit rating and drop Greece's rating to junk
status. [ID:nN10227186]
 Prices of Greek and other government bonds rose on Monday
as the European Central Bank began buying debt to ease
borrowing costs and boost liquidity.[ID:nLDE649263]
 In the long run, though, analysts said that would increase
the supply of euros and keep euro zone interest rates low. That
would pressure the currency, particularly if the Fed lifts U.S.
interest rates as expected later this year.
 The rescue increases temporary access to funding to
strapped euro zone governments but ""does nothing to resolve the
questions of solvency, especially in the case of Greece,"" said
David Gilmore, principal at Foreign Exchange Analytics in
Essex, Connecticut.
 As of May 4, speculators were still making record large
bets against the euro, according to data from the Commodity

 By Steven C. Johnson and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Monday
after global policymakers announced a $1 trillion emergency
loan plan to stabilize the currency and prevent a European
sovereign debt crisis from spreading.
 The money, which would be available to euro zone countries
that get into financial trouble, was the biggest bailout since
Group of 20 leaders rolled out emergency support for the world
economy following the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 The euro soared above $1.30, rebounding from a 14-month low

Greece would spread to other euro zone countries, including
Spain and Portugal. U.S. and European stocks also rallied.
 But concerns lingered, including questions about how
quickly aid could be disbursed, and that knocked the currency
back to around $1.28.
 ""From a global perspective, the package provides breathing
room for other countries that have transgressed on fiscal
matters and should give more time to get their house in order,""
said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS
Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.
 But it ""will do no more than pad the euro downside against
a sharp collapse rather than turn it around,"" he said, adding
the euro is still headed to ""the low $1.20s by late summer.""
 The euro hit a session high of $1.3093 Monday, according to
Reuters data, before easing to $1.2803, up about 0.3 percent.
It rose 1.8 percent to 119.29 yen after last week hitting its
lowest level since 2001. The dollar also added 1.8 percent to
93.210 yen.
 Sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.4866 but retreated from a

the party's chances of forming a new government with the
Liberal Democrats.

the poll's top vote-getter, the Conservatives.
 The pound hit one-year lows of $1.4475 last week for fear
political stalemate will hamper efforts to tackle the UK's
public deficit.
 PRESSURE REMAINS
 The bailout includes contributions from the International
Monetary Fund. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve reopened
currency swap facilities with other major central banks on
Sunday to ease market strains in Europe.
 But even with Monday's gains, the euro is still down 10.5
percent this year, making it the worst performing major
currency.
 ""There are still some questions about the sustainability in
the medium term,"" said Robert Lynch, currency strategist at
HSBC in New York, ""because you're simply borrowing more money
to meet upcoming obligations, and it doesn't necessarily
address the root causes of the problem.""
 Prices of Greek and other government bonds rose sharply on
Monday as the European Central Bank began buying the debt in
the open market, fulfilling its role in the bailout.
 In the long run, though, analysts said that would increase

 BRUSSELS, May 10 (Reuters) - The Netherlands wants the
European Union to adopt tougher steps against child labour,
including bans on products and withholding of trade privileges
on states that allow it, its foreign minister said on Monday.
 He said more than 200 million children performed work that
contravened international standards for child labour --
including forced labour, slavery, prostitution and drug
trafficking -- and harmful and dangerous work.
 ""I believe the European Union should do more to combat child
labour,"" Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen told the European
Parliament. ""In order to be effective we need both carrots and a
stick.""
 Verhagen cited a report by the EU's executive European
Commission which called for better use of all available
instruments, including political dialogue, development
cooperation and trade measures to combat child labour.
 He said he would call for an EU summit in June to make the
issue a priority in the bloc's development programmes with third
countries and to adopt a series of steps.
 These included a certification scheme to promote corporate
responsibility and clauses in EU public procurement contracts to
oblige firms to show they comply with international standards.
 He called for bans to be enforced on products involving the
worst forms of child labour.
 Diplomats and experts say child labour continues to thrive
because of consumer demand for cheap products and many companies
worry that they will lose competitive advantage if they are
forced to comply with measures banning the practice.

 WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - China needs to move to a
more consumption- and service-based economy and the world
economy would benefit if it adopted a more market-based
exchange rate, a senior U.S. State Department official said on
Monday.
 U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said in a
speech that since U.S. President Barack Obama took office in
January 2009, China and the United States had helped to pull
the world economy out of the financial crisis and now needed to
do more to sustain economic recovery.
 ""We need to turn to the elements that will make this
recovery sustainable over the long term and that, of course,
requires China to recognize the need to shift to a more
consumption- and service-based economy,"" Steinberg said in a
speech at Washington's Brookings Institution think tank.
 Steinberg also repeated the U.S. view that China should
move to a more market-based exchange rate, although he
acknowledged it may take time.
 ""Clearly one element of this, as we have made clear, we
believe, is the importance of China moving toward a
market-based exchange rate,"" he said.
 ""It needs to be done in a way that recognizes that these
are changes that take place over time but we need to move in
the right direction if we are going to give the global economy
and global markets (confidence) that we are going in the right
direction,"" Steinberg said. ""Moving towards market-based
exchange rates is a win-win because all of the economies will
be stronger.""

 By Foo Yun Chee
 BRUSSELS, May 10 (Reuters) - Elder statesman Mario Monti
urged European Union countries on Monday to make concessions on
tax policy, social services, workers' rights and industrial
policy to strengthen Europe's single market.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso charged
the former EU competition and internal market commissioner last
year with preparing a plan to revive the single market in the
face of rising protectionism since the financial crisis began.
 Monti urged all member states to abandon long-held positions
and further open the internal market of 500 million people,
which is based on the principle of free movement of people,
goods, services and capital, and is the cornerstone of EU
prosperity.
 ""The single market is less popular than ever, yet it is more
needed than ever,"" the Italian economist said in the 107-page
report which he handed to Barroso.
 Monti said ""socially-minded"" countries -- France and Germany
-- should do more to open up their markets in exchange for
better cooperation from the EU's Anglo-Saxon countries, a
reference to states such as Britain and Ireland.
 This, he said, would be part of a ""package deal"" from which
all member states could see gains if they made concessions.
 ""The case for the single market needs to be made afresh, in
a context that is profoundly different form the one in which the
project was launched 25 years ago,"" he said.
 He made clear that, in exchange for more cooperation on tax
policy, workers' rights, public services and industrial policy,
Paris and Berlin would be more willing to open their energy,
telecoms and services markets to more cross-border competition.
 He called for improved coordination on tax policies, saying
Europe had a ""highly fragmented tax landscape"", but stopped
short of seeking tax harmonisation which is opposed by Britain,
Ireland and east European states with low corporate taxes.
 ""There is scope for exploring measures of tax coordination
that would smooth over rough edges ... while respecting tax
sovereignty,"" he said.
 Monti's recommendations have been overshadowed by Greece's
debt crisis and efforts to prevent it engulfing other countries
in the single currency area.
 EU efforts to extend and streamline the internal market in
the last decade have ended in failure on takeover rules and a
single European patent, or have been severely watered down on
opening up the cross-border market for services and energy.
 Public support for free markets has also decreased in
western Europe because of increased unemployment and the
discrediting of financial capitalism during the credit crisis.
 But Monti proposed steps to boost consumer confidence in the
single market, saying it should become easier for Europeans to
receive compensation of they are the victims of unfair and
anti-competitive business behaviour.
 He rejected calls for loosening strict EU state aid rules,
saying these were essential to prevent a subsidy race.

firms
 * Financial turmoil made China more confident in its
approach
 By Paul Eckert
 WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - Chinese policies aimed at
elbowing out multinationals and reserving large parts of
China's market for domestic firms could cause confrontation
with the United States and other Western countries, a U.S.
political risk expert warned on Monday.
 Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer said the global
financial meltdown has made the United States and other Western
economies seem ""less indispensable"" as China pursues its main
priority of political stability through economic growth.
 ""There is a war coming between Western multinational
corporations and privately owned national champions and
state-owned enterprises in China in many, many sectors,"" he
told Reuters in an interview.
 Western multinationals operating in many sectors in China
are finding ""that there are competitors in China, it's not an
equal playing field, the Chinese don't need foreign direct
investment dollars,"" Bremmer said.
 ""From an investment perspective, suddenly strategies that
you thought were going to lead to a lot of money and profit are
looking unsustainable in that country, and that's going to
cause tensions -- very big tensions -- between the two largest
economies,"" he said.
 Bremmer book, ""The End of the Free Market,"" identifies
China as a foremost practitioner of ""state capitalism"" -- an
economic policy that applies authoritarianism, mercantilism and
free markets in the service of a government's political goals.
 China's state capitalism contrasts with the U.S. approach,
in which many teams compete under a free market while the
government serves as as a referee, upholding rules and
punishing those that break the law, he said.
 ""In China, you have a system where the ref has filled one
of the teams with members of their family and close friends,
and furthermore they've only told that team what the actual
rules are,"" Bremmer said.
 The financial turmoil of the past two years, in which U.S.
market regulators failed to prevent practices that led to a
meltdown, has made China more confident in the state capitalist
approach, he said.
 As a result of the financial crisis, the Chinese are trying
to decouple their economy from the West by reducing its
dependence on exports and raising domestic demand, while
keeping more of the value of their exports at home by making
their products more sophisticated.
 ""The Chinese view the Americans as increasingly less
indispensable than they used to be,"" Bremmer said.
 Conflicting approaches over trade and business increasingly
spill into geopolitics as China's quest for energy and
resources to feed economic growth leads it to forge close ties
with Iran, Sudan and others viewed by the West as
destabilizing.
 This explains why China is likely to remain at odds with
the United States and its allies over sanctions aimed at
stopping Iran's nuclear ambitions and over efforts to cut
carbon emissions to fight climate change, Bremmer said.
 ""The top priority is political stability, which requires
economic growth, and those things will require a vastly more
confrontational positioning vis-a-vis the West,"" he said.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Global equity markets staged a
massive relief rally on Monday after officials agreed to a $1
trillion emergency rescue package to avert a festering
sovereign debt crisis in Europe from engulfing the rest of the
world.
 The euro rose broadly after the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund carved out an emergency rescue
package of up to 750 billion euros ($1 trillion) to keep
Greece's debt crisis from spreading through the euro zone.
 The price of oil and other commodities surged as the rescue
deal stoked investors' appetite for riskier assets.
 The surge in equities began in Asian markets after European
and IMF officials announced the deal and then caught fire
around the world as other markets opened. European shares rose
at their fastest pace in more than 17 months, and in the United
States the Dow industrials had their biggest intraday move
since March 2009.
 ""This could've been another situation like when Bear
Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed, but the rescue plan shows
how serious Europe is about preventing that,"" said Alan Lancz,
president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates, an investment advisory
firm, in Toledo, Ohio.
 Banks ranked among the top beneficiaries as the rescue deal
reduced fears of a possible default. The STOXX Europe 600
banking index <.SX7P> jumped 14 percent after a drop last week
by the same magnitude.
 On Wall Street, the S&P Financial index <.GSPF> climbed 5.6
percent and was the top gainer among S&P sectors.
 A global measure of world equity performance gained almost
5 percent, with markets in Italy, Spain and Portugal climbing
more than 10 percent. U.S. equity markets also jumped.
 The euro rebounded from last week's 14-month low, while
debt yields narrowed sharply against benchmarks. The interbank
costs of borrowing euro and dollar funds fell for the first
time since April. For details see: [ID:nN10125854]
[ID:nLDE6491GQ] [ID:nLDE6491TZ]
 The euro later retreated below $1.29 after initial euphoria
that had lifted the single currency to near $1.31 faded a bit.
 Policy makers ""have, at least for the time being, drawn a
line under the liquidity concerns in Europe,"" said Matthew
Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto. ""As a result, we've seen risk appetite return to the
markets across different asset classes.""
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
4.8 percent, while its emerging market index <.MSCIEF> gained
4.5 percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed up 7.4
percent at 1,038.91, the biggest one-day percentage gain since
November 2008.
 At 12:30 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
up 396.85 points, or 3.82 percent, at 10,777.28. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 46.14 points, or 4.15 percent,
at 1,157.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 100.05
points, or 4.42 percent, at 2,365.69.
 The rescue package was on the scale of the $700 billion
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) launched by the United
States to fend off the financial crisis of 2007-2009.
 There were also measures by central banks to address
funding strains and a European Central Bank plan to buy the
region's government bonds. [ID:nLDE6450VF]
 A number of European central banks said they had already
started. [nLDE649051]
 The euro  rallied from last week's 14-month low
against the dollar. The single currency was up 1.4 percent at
$1.2833, having fallen to $1.2510 on trading platform EBS last
week.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.43 percent at 84.084.
 Against the yen, the dollar  was up 1.97 percent at
93.36.
 Spot gold fell to $1,183.85 in early trade as the package
boosted risk appetite, while commodity prices such as crude oil
and industrial metals rose.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose $1.45 to $76.56 a
barrel after earlier topping $77. ICE Brent crude for June
 rose $1.68 to $79.95.
 Spot gold prices  fell $9.85 to $1197.90 an ounce.
 In bond markets, the premiums investors demand to buy
peripheral euro zone government bonds rather than German
benchmarks fell.
 Greek bonds were the biggest gainers in the euro zone with
the short-end outperforming, causing the 2/10-year yield curve
to flatten sharply and briefly disinvert. [ID:nLDE6492F8]
 Liquidity in Greek bonds dried up last week with no trades
going through.
 ""They've attacked this problem from all angles and it's
given a big boost to risk markets at the expense of government
bonds,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA Capital
Markets in Edinburgh.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 37/32 in price to yield 3.56 percent.
 In Asia, Hong Kong shares had their biggest one-day rise in
five months, the MSCI ex-Japan index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 3.4
percent, and Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended up 1.6 percent.
 But concerns lingered whether the package can achieve
long-term success as the root problems of dealing with
mushrooming public deficits remain. [ID:nLDE6490BM]

"
1388,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2010 01:40PM ET</span>",Q&A-Germany's contribution to euro zone aid package," BERLIN, May 10 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on
Monday her cabinet aimed to push through quickly Germany's part
of a $1 trillion emergency rescue package to stabilise the euro.
 The package -- 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro
states plus 60 billion euros in a European instrument -- may
prove another headache for Merkel, who has come under heavy fire
for taking too long to approve aid to bail out Greece.
 Below are questions and answers about Germany's likely
contribution to the rescue package, and parliamentary and legal
obstacles Merkel faces to gaining approval for this:
 
 HOW MUCH IS GERMANY FORECAST TO CONTRIBUTE?
 Euro zone members are seen contributing to the guarantees
according to their respective holdings in the European Central
Bank capital. Based on this calculation, Europe's largest
economy is seen contributing around 123 billion euros in
guarantees to the package.
 However, government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm on Monday said
this sum could be greater, given that some euro countries that
are fighting their own budget deficit problems may not
contribute to the emergency fund.
 
 WILL THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT NEED TO APPROVE AID FOR GREECE?
 Yes. If states using German guarantees to back up loans then
default on the latter, German taxpayer's money will be exposed,
so the government plans to pass a law to approve the package.
 
 HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR PARLIAMENT TO APPROVE THE AID?
 Merkel said the cabinet would meet on Tuesday to approve
Germany's contribution and a law would be passed through
parliament soon, although it was not clear if it would get
fast-track parliamentary approval.
 ""We don't need to pass the law in two or three days, we can
conclude the consultations with a bit more time, quickly but
thoroughly..."" she said.
 Juergen Trittin, a leader of the opposition Greens, said he
thought the law could not be approved before the start of June.
 
 HOW DIFFICULT WILL IT BE TO GET SUPPORT FOR THE AID?
 Opposition to the emergency fund is likely to be widespread
in Germany, where a majority of the public disapproved of the
Greece bailout plan due to fears of a rising budget deficit at
home and indignation at bailing out another country.
 However, Merkel was firm in underlining the necessity of the
package on Monday, saying it was necessary to defend the
European common currency and that the guarantees would be linked
to countries presenting strict budget consolidation programmes.
 Her centre-right coalition of conservatives and pro-business
Free Democrats (FDP) has a clear majority in the Bundestag lower
house of parliament, which could make approval a formality.
 Her coalition no longer has a majority in the Bundesrat
upper house since losing an election in North Rhine-Westphalia
on Sunday. But they could get support from opposition parties
such as the Greens, who backed the Greek aid package.
 The main opposition party, the Social Democrats (SPD), has
not indicated whether it would support the emergency euro
package, but insisted the financial sector should participate in
the costs of overcoming the euro crisis.
 Merkel may try to forge a plan on financial sector
participation to gain the SPD's support. The SPD abstained from
voting on the Greece aid package after failing to push through
an addendum in support of a European financial transaction tax.
 
 WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A LEGAL CHALLENGE?
 One of the academics who fought the Greek aid, eurosceptic
economist Joachim Starbatty, said he might file a similar
lawsuit against the European rescue plan. [ID:nLDE64910U]
 Starbatty, who with four others has tried to get Germany's
top court to stop the Greek aid, said the package agreed in
Brussels on Sunday limited the German parliament's scope to act.
 The previous complaint at the Federal Constitutional Court
argued aid for Greece was not provided for in European Union
treaties and could increase inflation pressures.
 It is unclear how long the court will take to decide on that
complaint. Some of the academics lost a challenge to the
introduction of the euro currency and experts doubt they will
have more success on the issue of aid for Greece.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2010 12:40PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-France not adopting austerity policy -Sarkozy," * France will not adopt austerity measures
 * Plans to restore public finances once recovery takes off
 * Greater effort on pensions demanded of high earners
 
 (Adds details)
 PARIS, May 10 (Reuters) - France will not adopt austerity
measures, unlike some of its European Union partners, but will
look to restore its public finances as the economic recovery
takes root, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Monday.
 The government said last week that it was going to freeze
much public spending over the coming three years in an effort to
keep a lid on the budget deficit, but Sarkozy told union and
business leaders this did not amount to an austerity plan.
 ""In the framework of efforts to stabilise the markets which
we took last weekend, some of our partners who are under the
most threat announced austerity measures,"" Sarkozy said.
 ""Some would want to see a similar turn in our economic
policy. I tell them they are wrong.""
 However, Sarkozy added that it was still ""imperative"" to
rectify public finances to prevent market turmoil from
undermining the efforts made to emerge from the economic crisis.
 The debt crisis pummelling Greece has threatened to suck in
other EU economies including Portugal and Spain. 
 Worried about its own cherished AAA rating, the French
government announced a broad spending freeze last week and
officials say it is vital on-going negotiations over a reform of
the loss-making pension reform lead to a substantive deal.
 Sarkozy said on Monday the reform would require high earners
to pay larger contributions to the state system, adding that
income from capital would also be taxed at a higher rate to help
make up the pensions shortfall.
 But the president added that the reform would not work if it
just involved hiking pension charges. 
 
 ARGUING OVER AUSTERITY 
 The overhaul is due to come into force by the end of 2010,
but the government is not expected to introduce major changes
overnight, preferring to ease in the measures progressively.
 France is forecasting a public deficit to come in at 8
percent of gross domestic product this year and aims to bring
this down to within the EU's three percent limit by 2013.
 In an effort to meet this target, French Prime Minister
Francois Fillon's office said last week that that state
spending, excepting interest payments and pensions, would be
frozen in value for the period 2011-2013. [ID:nLDE6451OV]
 It added that state operating costs would be cut by 10
percent over three years, with a 5 percent cut in 2011.
 Prominent members of Sarkozy's centre-right UMP party have
said this amounted to an austerity plan -- a term which has
become something of a political taboo in France out of fear that
the very notion of belt-tightening would fuel street protests.
 ""The word that I myself would use is 'austerity'. After all,
we're not here to fight over words,"" Jean-Francois Cope, head of
the UMP parliamentary group, told Europe 1 radio on Monday.
 Sluggish growth prospects have made the task of restoring
order to public finances more difficult and the European
Commission has said assumptions underpinning the 2011 and 2012
deficit forecasts were ""optimistic"".

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Monday after global policymakers announced a $1 trillion
emergency package to stabilize the currency and prevent a
sovereign debt crisis in Europe from spreading.
 The aid package, hammered out by European Union finance
ministers, central bankers and the International Monetary Fund,
was the biggest since Group of 20 leaders rolled out support
measures after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
 The euro rebounded from last week's 14-month low to hit
near $1.31 earlier as the plan eased contagion fears, which
triggered a global rout in equities and other risky assets last
week. It then retreated below $1.29 as concerns remain about
the medium-term outlook for the currency.
 ""There was a sizable relief rally in the euro and a
correction in risk assets which have sold off substantially in
the second half of last week,"" said Robert Lynch, currency
strategist at HSBC in New York.
 ""There are still some questions about the sustainability in
the medium term,"" he added. ""Because you're simply borrowing
more money to meet upcoming obligations and it doesn't
necessarily address the root causes of the problem.""
 The European Central Bank immediately began implementing
its part of the deal, with euro zone central banks buying
government bonds in the open market.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was up 0.8 percent at
$1.2852. It had earlier risen as high as $1.3093, according to
Reuters data, up from a low of $1.2510 hit on trading platform
EBS last week.
 Currency speculators increased bets against the euro to a
new record high last week, according to data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. Bets in favor of the dollar rose to
a level strategists say was the highest since the euro's launch
in 1999.
 PRESSURE REMAINS
 Uncertainty persisted, however, over whether the package
could give the euro lasting support since Greece and other
peripheral euro zone countries must tackle fiscal deficits when
their growth outlook is deteriorating.
 ""There are still a lot of debt issues in Europe,"" said
Brendan McGrath, manager of business solutions at Custom House,
a Western Union company, in Victoria, British Columbia. ""It
seems like people are happy to be taking profits on the euro as
it pops up as we've seen this morning. There's still obviously
pressure on the euro.""
 Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist in London, said
medium-term upside risks for the euro could suggest an
extension to $1.3490. Though he said challenges facing Greece's
austerity requirements and doubts about Spain's short-term debt
""suggest a protracted retreat towards $1.23, followed by $1.17""
by the third quarter.
 Despite Monday's gains, the euro is still down 10 percent
this year, making it the worst performing major currency.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 2.7 percent to 120.07, and
the dollar was up 1.9 percent at 93.34
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 83.934. The U.S. Federal Reserve reopened
currency swap facilities with other major central banks on
Sunday to ease market strains in Europe.
 Sterling rose 0.6 percent to $1.4893, helped by a broader
recovery in risky assets.
 Britain's opposition Conservatives and Liberal Democrats
resumed talks on Monday to reach a deal to govern. The pound
hit one-year lows of $1.4475 on Friday on concerns a political
stalemate will hamper efforts to tackle the UK's public
deficits.

 WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve
said on Monday it reopened a currency swap line with the Bank

major central banks to help quell an escalating financial

 The Fed said it would revive a dollar liquidity swap
arrangement with the Bank of Japan without upper limit through

 The Fed announced the return of swap lines without limit
with the European Central bank, the Bank of England and the
Swiss National Bank late on Sunday as European authorities
announced a huge aid package to prevent contagion from the
Greek debt crisis. The Fed also opened a swap line with the
Bank of Canada up to $30 billion.
 The Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- said in a statement on
Monday it would not be exposed to foreign exchange or private
bank risk from the credit lines. The Fed's relationship is
exclusively with the foreign central bank, and the Fed is not
exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates, the Fed said.

Corp are active in the Indian market and have given global
rivals tough competition in the world's fastest growing
telecoms market.
 Ties between India and China have warmed recently in the
backdrop of a trade boom and close cooperation on climate
change since the Copenhagen world climate talks in December,
after a difficult year that saw them clash over a raft of
issues including their long-disputed border.
 ""At some stage, if we become paranoid about Chinese
investments in India, as we seem to be, then we are not going
to be able to derive the full benefits of the Copenhagen
spirit,"" Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh was quoted
by Times of India newspaper as saying in Beijing, where he was
on a visit.
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has ""clarified it is not
appropriate that ministers comment on other departments,
ministries, or subjects, especially and particularly when they
are on foreign soil,"" Congress party spokesman Abhishek Manu
Singhvi told reporters.
 Despite a boom in bilateral commerce in the past decade,
India and China remain suspicious of each other's growing
global clout and have in the past traded charges of
protectionism. India has long pushed for greater access to the
Chinese market to help close a chunky trade deficit in
Beijing's favour.
 ""We have a huge trade deficit with China. But we are still
suspicious of Chinese investment in India,"" the Press Trust of
India quoted Ramesh as saying in Beijing.
 Shenzhen-based Huawei, which last fiscal year more than
doubled its India revenue to $1.4 billion, has sought to meet
Indian officials to allay these concerns, which could see it
lose business to firms like Ericsson, Nokia Siemens Networks
and Alcatel Lucent.
 ""While we encourage trade, we are also mindful of some of
the needs of the security establishment,"" Indian Trade Minister
Anand Sharma told reporters on Monday, denying there was a
China-specific ban.
 In an interview with Reuters last week, U.K. Bansal,
India's internal security chief, said telecoms equipment from
any country could be a security concern and would require
proper scrutiny.
 ""Telecom anywhere, all over the country, its security and
its reliability and its vitality is always a matter of
concern,"" he said.
 Ramesh's comments sparked the latest in a series of recent
spats in which Congress party officials or ministers spoke out
against a government stance.
 Last month, Digvijay Singh, a general secretary seen close
to Congress-scion Rahul Gandhi, criticised Home Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram's strategy against the Maoist
insurgency and said he had been a victim of the minister's
""intellectual arrogance.""

1396,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2010 10:56AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-Weak euro zone states may not need aid," LISBON, May 10 (Reuters) - With their bonds strengthening
after the announcement of a $1 trillion financial safety net for
the euro zone, even the weakest states other than Greece may not
need to use the net, officials and analysts say. [ID:nSGE6490HH]
 Countries are reluctant to apply for emergency aid partly
because it would come with tough requirements to impose
austerity measures, similar to those demanded in the
International Monetary Fund's bailout programmes.
 Here is the outlook for Portugal, Ireland and Spain, the
three countries which many analysts see as the next potential
""dominoes"" after Greece.
PORTUGAL
 Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said in
Brussels on Sunday night that it would be premature to decide
whether Portugal would need to apply for emergency funds.
 Commerzbank economist Ralph Solveen said, ""I wouldn't say
the probability of Portugal needing to apply for the safety net
is high. If the ECB's bond buying is successful and it calms
down the markets, I'd say it's lower than 50 percent.
 ""The ECB is buying bonds and the pockets of the ECB are very
deep. Perhaps they will not need the bailout after all.""
 Moody's Investors Service last week put Portugal's Aa2
rating on a three-month review for a possible downgrade, but
said that though Portugal's financing costs might rise for some
time because of market pressures, it expected debt servicing to
""remain very affordable in the near to medium term"".
 It said ""the government's debt is neither unsustainable nor
unbearable.""
 Diego Iscaro, economist at IHS Global Insight in London,
said: ""I don't think Portugal has liquidity problems, so the
need to apply is surely below 50 percent. All depends on how
this aid will materialise, but I'd say the probability is about
20 percent in a 12-month horizon.""
 He added, ""If they choose aid at IMF terms, I think there
will be a lot of opposition, especially from the people, since
the economy is already performing poorly and unemployment is on
the rise.""
 But Antonio Costa Pinto, a political scientist in Lisbon,
said that if the government did apply for the safety net, its
plan would probably be accepted by parliament, where the main
opposition party is on the centre-right of the spectrum.
 ""There will be some social polarisation, but from the
example of our direct agreements with the IMF in 1979 and 1983,
which had very tough conditions, I don't expect too much
opposition. The levels of social conflict in Portugal are
relatively low.""
 Portugal's budget deficit is expected to drop from 9.4
percent of gross domestic product in 2009 to 8.5 percent this
year and 7.9 percent in 2011, the European Commission forecast
this month. Gross government debt is predicted to rise from 76.8
percent to 85.8 percent and 91.1 percent. [ID:nBRQ009230]
[ID:nBRQ009831]
 
 IRELAND
 Ireland has no immediate funding problems and sees no need
to use the safety net, the Finance Ministry said on Monday.
 Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said his country's fiscal
position was not questioned at the meeting of euro zone finance
ministers on Sunday.
 ""There's no suggestion that any state other than Greece has
funding difficulties...There were no suggestions in the meeting
that Ireland has any difficulties whatsoever,"" Lenihan told
national radio RTE, adding that he was under no pressure to draw
up an early budget.
 Ireland could continue borrowing at current market rates
without seriously damaging its finances until the first half of
2011, according to Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham
Stockbrokers.
 Asked about the chances of Ireland applying for a bailout in
the next 12 months, he said: ""I would have it relatively low.
Obviously it depends on global conditions, but I would have it
relatively low, 25-30 percent.""
 McQuaid said there was a recognition among public sector
workers that they did not want to go down the Greek route.
 ""I think there is an element, and you can see it here with
the public service unions and union leaders, there is a
recognition that you don't want to go down the step where you
have to need recourse to the IMF.""
 Retail sales, jobless, budget and Purchasing Managers Index
data last week offered signs that Ireland might be about to exit
the euro zone's longest running recession.
 ""Last week was the best week for a long time on the Irish
economy data front,"" Brian Devine, economist at NCB
Stockbrokers, said in a note. ""The worry was that financial
contagion would spread and harm the recovery. The EU bailout
should ensure that this does not occur.""
 Ireland's budget deficit is due to shrink from 14.3 percent
of GDP last year to 11.7 percent this year, but edge up to 12.1
percent next year, according to the EC. Its government debt/GDP
ratio is expected to rise from 64.0 percent last year to 77.3
percent this year and 87.3 percent next year.
 
 SPAIN
 Spain says it has the necessary financing and access to
capital sources to avoid having to use the safety net.
 ""The Spanish government will not have to use this measure at
all; Spain's deputy prime minister (and economy minister) Elena
Salgado was very clear about that yesterday,"" a spokesman for
the economy ministry said.
 Many analysts agree. ""The pressure on Spain's financing
costs is not enough to trigger this aid mechanism. Portugal's
situation is more compromising, but the approval of the measures
dissipates the tension,"" said Sara Balinas from Analistas
Financieras Internacionales.
 The existence of the safety net should be enough to bolster
markets and this, combined with fresh cuts in the budget deficit
announced on Monday, should make any use of emergency funding
less likely, BNP analyst Luigi Speranza said. [ID:nMDT009015]
 ""The fact that the money is available is having a huge
impact on the market today; this in itself reduces the chances
that Spain will have to tap the extra financing.""
 He added, ""There has been considerable commitment from
institutions including the ECB. Now it's really important to see
how markets take it...at the moment they are taking it very
well.""
 Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is expected to
give more details on the new deficit cuts -- which would bring
the deficit to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2010 and 6.5 percent in
2011 -- when he appears before parliament on Wednesday. Last
year the deficit was 11.2 percent.
 Spain's debt/GDP ratio is expected to climb from 53.2
percent last year to 64.9 percent this year and 72.5 percent
next year, the EC said last week, before the announcement of the
new deficit targets.

 By Johan Sennero and Magnus Bellander
 STOCKHOLM, May 10 (Reuters) - Swedish central banker Svante
Oberg said on Monday there was little risk of the Greek debt
crisis spreading to Sweden and he saw no change to the country's
economic situation since the last monetary policy meeting.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg said his country was prepared
to contribute to the European Union's new rescue fund and urged
fellow non-euro state Britain to do so too.
 ""The risk of a spreading effect is very small,"" Oberg told
Reuters on the sidelines of a seminar when asked about contagion
risks from Greece.
 European Union leaders, central bankers and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) thrashed out a rescue package
worth about $1 trillion at the weekend to stabilise financial
markets and prevent the Greek debt crisis from destroying the
euro currency.
 Sweden has said it will support the effort, but Finance
Minister Anders Borg declined to specify the size of any
contribution by the Nordic country.
 ""We are prepared to move forward on a case-by-case basis and
consider if there is reason for Sweden to participate in
different efforts,"" Borg said separately.
 ""That must in any case occur on the basis of an assessment
that the countries have done everything they can and at terms
that are reasonable to taxpayers. So, we have no legal
obligation to participate in the work.""
 Borg said Sweden was the only non-eurozone member to open
the door to possible contributions of funds toward the package
outside the auspices of the IMF, but added that he expected more
countries to follow suit.
 ""For me, it is completely unrealistic to consider that the
British could, so to speak, say that they will not participate
in this,"" he said.
 
 DEBT MOUNTAIN
 Borg said the rescue package had laid the foundations for a
continued global economic recovery, though he added it would be
""naive"" to disregard the risk posed by bloated deficits in a
host of countries.
 ""The United States, Japan and England have deficits of more
than 10 percent of GDP. This is an iceberg, and at the top of it
stands Greece, Spain and Portugal,"" he told journalists.
 The Riksbank's Oberg, asked if Sweden's economic situation
had changed since the Riksbank held its last monetary policy
meeting on April 19, said: ""No, it does not look any different.""
 The Riksbank held its key interest rate at a record-low of
0.25 percent and said a first hike could come as early as summer
or autumn as the economy regains a more normal footing.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Monday, rebounding from last week's 14-month low against the
dollar after policymakers announced a $1 trillion emergency
package to stabilize the currency and euro zone central banks
began buying local government debt.
 The aid package, hammered out by European Union finance
ministers, central bankers and the International Monetary Fund,
was the biggest since Group of 20 leaders rolled out support
measures after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
 The euro earlier climbed near $1.31 as the plan calmed
investor nerves and sparked a rally in risky assets. It then
retreated below $1.30 as the initial euphoria faded somewhat.
 ""It's clear that (policymakers) have, at least for the time
being, drawn a line under the liquidity concerns in Europe,""
said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto. ""As a result, we've seen risk appetite
return to the markets across different asset classes.""
 Euro zone central banks started buying up government bonds
on Monday, in a reversal of the European Central Bank's
resistance to full-scale asset purchases as it fights to
contain Greece's debt crisis. See [ID:nLDE649051]
 Uncertainty persisted, however, over whether the package
could give the euro lasting support since Greece and other
peripheral euro zone countries must tackle fiscal deficits when
their growth outlook is deteriorating.
 ""Ultimately, the sustainability of this trend will depend
on whether the European countries can really implement the
fiscal austerity programs and through that create credibility,""
Strauss added.
 In early New York trading, the euro  was trading with
gains of around 1.3 percent at $1.2924 having earlier risen as
high as $1.3093, according to Reuters data.
 The euro had fallen to $1.2510 on trading platform EBS last
week, coinciding with currency speculators boosting bets in
favor of the dollar to a level strategists said was the highest
since the euro's launch in 1999 [IMM/FX].

 The single currency is still down about 9 percent since
January, making it the worst performing major currency.
 The euro rose 3 percent to 120.34 yen  after
hitting an eight-year low near just above 110 last week.
 ""There is some uncertainty lingering about the mechanisms
of the stabilization funds. In particular, it is still unclear
where the money for the funds is going to come from,"" said
Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at Societe Generale.
 The dollar fell 1.1 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 83.534 <.DXY>. The U.S. Federal Reserve reopened
currency swap facilities with other major central banks on
Sunday to ease market strains in Europe.
 The Fed revived facilities established during the 2007-2008
financial crisis with the European Central Bank, and the
central banks of Canada, the UK and Switzerland.
 POLITICAL STALEMATE
 Sterling rose 1.4 percent to $1.5005 , helped by a
broader recovery in risky assets, while the euro was up 0.1
percent at 86.17 pence .
 Britain's opposition Conservatives and Liberal Democrats
resumed talks on Monday to reach a deal to govern
[ID:nLDE6480O4]. Investors are concerned a political stalemate
will hamper efforts to tackle the UK's huge public deficits.
 Such concerns pushed the pound to one-year lows of $1.4475
on Friday.
 The Bank of England left interest rates at 0.5 percent and
decided not to undertake further quantitative easing purchases
at its Monetary Policy Committee meeting, as expected.

 * No agreement over price
 * China unlikely to get all the reserves it wants
 
 By Randy Fabi
 ABUJA, May 10 (Reuters) - Talks between Nigeria and China
over Beijing's bid to buy 6 billion barrels of the OPEC member's
oil reserves have been stalled for months due to a dispute over
price, a senior Nigerian government official said on Monday.
 China last year offered to invest as much as $50 billion to
acquire a large stake in Africa's biggest energy sector, a bid
which included incursions into some oil blocks held by Royal
Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron.
 ""We have not had any discussions with China for several
months,"" Emmanuel Egbogah, Nigeria's presidential adviser on
energy, told Reuters in the capital Abuja.
 ""We have made our position clear. We told them we want a
fair market value for our oil.""
 Egbogah declined to specify how much Nigeria was seeking for
its oil, which usually sells at a premium in the physical crude
markets because it can be more easily refined into fuel products
than Middle Eastern grades.
 Egbogah reiterated that China was unlikely to be given all
the reserves it wanted.
 The last reported talks between the two countries occurred
during Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi's trip to Nigeria in
January.
 Egbogah said Nigeria remained open to talks with China, but
no date had been set for another round of negotiations.
 
 LEVERAGE
 Industry executives have said Nigeria is using the
possibility of a Chinese bid for its oil as leverage in
difficult contract renewal negotiations with its existing
Western oil partners.
 Exxon is the only one so far to obtain a renewal for its
three shallow water oil licences, which currently produce around
580,000 barrels per day, for a further 20 years.
 But that agreement has come under doubt as it has not been
formally signed off on by Nigeria's oil minister, local
newspaper ThisDay reported last week.
 Egbogah declined to comment on the story, while Exxon said
it does not disclose details of business discussions.
 Egbogah also said the government had yet to approve Shell's
sale of three Nigerian oil licences to a consortium consisting
of two local firms and France's Maurel & Prom.
 Shell in January agreed to sell oil mining leases 4, 38, 41
located in the northwestern part of the Niger Delta. The leases
include 30 wells with a production capacity of around 50,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day.
 ""Shell must present this request of divestment to the
government. We have not received that yet,"" Egbogah said.

 BERLIN, May 10 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble will be released from a Brussels hospital later on
Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday, adding there
was no need for a cabinet reshuffle due to his health.
 Schaeuble, wheelchair-bound since being shot and nearly
killed in 1990, was admitted to a Brussels hospital after an
adverse reaction to new medicine at the weekend.
 The hospitalisation forced Schaeuble to miss a Sunday
meeting of EU finance ministers who agreed a $1 trillion global
emergency rescue package to shield the euro zone from a
sovereign debt crisis.
 ""According to my information, he should be released from the
hospital today,"" Merkel told reporters, adding she believed his
health had improved greatly.
 The 67-year-old Schaeuble had suffered from an allergic
reaction to a new antibiotic, his ministry said.
 The setback was the latest in a string of health scares for
Schaeuble, one of the most experienced figures in German
politics, who is widely seen as having taken a more pro-European
line than the chancellor in efforts to stabilise the euro.
 He has been forced to miss several high profile
international meetings on the euro zone debt crisis.
 Ongoing concerns about his health have triggered speculation
that Merkel will reshuffle the cabinet and appoint a new finance
minister to take over at this crucial time for the euro zone.
 But the chancellor dismissed such talk.
 ""There is no need for a reshuffle,"" she told reporters.
 A government spokesman added there was no reason to doubt
Schaeuble's ability to handle the euro zone crisis.
 ""The finance minister was intensively involved with the
subject (of the euro zone crisis) on Saturday and Sunday,""
Merkel's spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm told a regular news
conference.
 Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who deputised for
Schaeuble in Brussels, is seen as a possible replacement.
 Conservative Hesse state premier Roland Koch, and even
Juergen Ruettgers, premier in North Rhine-Westphalia, were also
tipped as potential candidates by business daily Handelsblatt.

Dombrovskis voiced concern on Monday that any enlargement of the
euro zone could be put on the backburner due to the financial
woes of Greece which have sparked tensions in the currency area.
 ""What we are somewhat concerned about is this kind of
simmering discussions that one should postpone enlargement of
the euro zone..."" Dombrovskis told Reuters on the sidelines of a
World Economic Forum conference.
 He did not elaborate who discussed a possible delay, but
some EU diplomats have said privately Greece's persistence in
breaching the euro zone's fiscal rules, which put the currency
area on the brink of a sovereign crisis, has made some
governments wary of adding more members to the euro club.
 Latvia, which joined the European Union in 2004, hopes to
adopt the euro in 2014. To do so, it must meet strict
""Maastricht"" criteria on the budget deficit, interest rates,
inflation and currency stability.
 Dombrovskis said the criteria were good, but the euro zone
should strengthen their implementation to prevent the repeat of
the Greek debt crisis.
 ""The real problem is that more of the euro zone countries
were not following Maastricht criteria and I think that is a
problem that needs to be addressed through some control
mechanism,"" he said.
 Deputy Serbian Prime Ministrer Bozidar Djelic, also present,
said the current crisis would make the EU more rigorous in
assessing whether candidate countries are ready to join the bloc
and. It may will also be less generous in aiding the candidates.
 ""Europe will become more demanding on every member and
aspiring members and that is just fine,"" he told Reuters.
 ""The solidarity will be less forthcoming but at the same
time it is important to keep the unity of the European
continent.""
 Serbia hopes to begin EU entry talks in the next few years.

 (adds reaction)
 By Christina Fincher
 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of England made no
change to interest rates or its asset purchases programme on
Monday, eager not to shock markets still reeling from Britain's
inconclusive election and the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.
 The decision to leave rates at a record low 0.5 percent was
expected by all 63 economists polled by Reuters, most of whom
expect no tightening until the fourth quarter of the year at the
earliest.
 The central bank's decision to make no change to its
quantitative easing target was also widely expected, and there
was no discernible market reaction.
 Price pressures in Britain have picked up faster than
expected in recent months, but the economic recovery remains
tentative and the euro zone's debt crisis has shown just how
fragile sentiment can be.
 ""The Monetary Policy Committee unsurprisingly judged that
now is not the time to be raising interest rates,"" said Howard
Archer at Global Insight.
 ""The downside risks to still fragile UK economic recovery
are magnified by current major political uncertainty and the
recent heightened market turmoil resulting from the Greek
crisis.""
 
 EMERGENCY MEASURES
 European central banks began buying euro zone government
bonds under a $1 trillion emergency rescue package on Monday,
helping the euro and European stocks recover some of last week's
heavy losses.
 Britain's central bank has bought almost 200 billion pounds
($309 billion) of UK government bonds under its quantitative
easing programme. It halted purchases in February but left open
the option of reviving the scheme should economic conditions
deteriorate.
 Britain's inconclusive election outcome provided additional
justification for the BoE's wait-and-see approach.

to reach a power-sharing deal with the centrist Liberal
Democrats on Monday after an election last Thursday threw up no

position since 1974. [ID:nLDE6480O4]
Investors are nervous a fragile coalition or minority
government could lack the political firepower needed to cut a
budget deficit running at more than 11 percent of GDP.
 The Bank of England cut rates to their current record low in
March 2009 when the economy was still reeling from the global
credit crunch.
 Things have improved since then but headwinds remain, not
least from a public spending squeeze that some predict will be
the toughest since the aftermath of World War Two. The BoE will
be reluctant to tamper with monetary policy until the extent of
the fiscal pain becomes clear, and that will depend on how
quickly a new government is formed.
 ""The pace of monetary tightening is dependent upon who forms
the next government and how aggressive a programme of fiscal
consolidation they implement,"" said Hetal Mehta, senior economic
advisor at Ernst & Young.
 ""We do not expect any monetary policy tightening until early
2011, when the economy will be in better shape.""

 MADRID, May 10 (Reuters) - Spain will cut its budget deficit
by a further 15 billion euros ($20.13 billion) by 2011 and has
no plans to resort to European Union aid to finance its debt, an
Economy Ministry spokesman said on Monday.
 A $1 trillion emergency EU/IMF-backed euro zone rescue
package [ID:nSGE6490HH] agreed over the weekend boosted markets
and the euro on Monday, but left longer-term questions about
whether Europe's weakest economies can manage their debt.
 Spain is trying to fend off comparisons with Greece as
markets demand more measures to convince them that Spain can
meet its target of cutting its budget deficit to an EU guideline
of 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013.
 Economists have said Spain's target will be hard to meet
given the poor prospects for economic growth.
 Still, Spain said it would not resort to the safety net
provided by the EU and International Monetary Fund to raise
financing.
 ""The Spanish government will not have to use this measure at
all, Spain's deputy prime minister (Economy Minister Elena

 (Adds sum of German contribution)
 By Dave Graham and Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, May 10 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on
Monday her cabinet aimed to expedite Germany's part of a $1
trillion emergency rescue package to stabilise the euro despite
suffering a serious state election defeat on Sunday.
 Merkel said the cabinet would meet on Tuesday to approve
Germany's contribution to the package thrashed out by European
Union finance ministers and the IMF at the weekend to prevent a
sovereign debt crisis spreading through the euro zone.
 Speaking just hours after her alliance of conservatives and
pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) lost a state election in North
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state, Merkel
said the rescue plan was needed to defend the euro.
 ""The member states of the European Union showed yesterday
that we have the common political will to do everything for the
stability of our common currency,"" she said in Berlin.
 The package -- 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro
states plus 60 billion euros in a European instrument -- could
include 123 billion in loan guarantees from Germany, according
to its share in the European Central Bank's capital holdings.
 But that sum could rise by up to 20 percent since member
states in trouble would not be expected to contribute to the
plan, Gregor Gysi, parliamentary group leader of the opposition
Left Party, said on Monday after speaking with Merkel.
 The package may prove another potential headache for Merkel,
who already has a mounting list of problems in Berlin.
 The chancellor has come under fire across the political
spectrum for taking too long to approve aid to bail out Greece,
a rescue which was unpopular in Germany and resonated strongly
in the final phase of the NRW election campaign.
 The Greek aid eventually got fast-track approval from
parliament despite concerns it could be derailed by internal
wrangling over the details and by a lawsuit by German academics.
 Merkel said she did not want to waste time in approving the
European package but that there was time to discuss it properly.
 ""We don't need to pass the law in two or three days. We can
conclude the consultations with a bit more time, quickly but
thoroughly, because 60 billion euros ... are already available
without any legal measures necessary,"" she said.
 Merkel's spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said that although not all
member states would be able to participate in planned bilateral
aid, the EU was not becoming ""a transfer union"".
 
 POLITICAL PROBLEMS AT HOME
 One of the academics who fought the Greek aid, eurosceptic
economist Joachim Starbatty, said he might file a similar
lawsuit against the European rescue plan.
 EU finance ministers said the International Monetary Fund
was expected to contribute 250 billion euros, raising the total
to 750 billion euros, about $1 trillion.
 The Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily said Merkel had been upstaged
by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in the EU talks, reinforcing
the impression she had dithered, and making it harder for the
chancellor to sell the rescue plan to a sceptical public.
 ""Now she will have to live with the verdict that a rescue
package a la Francaise could have been put together weeks ago,
but that she unnecessarily pushed up the cost of it,"" it said.
 Merkel's loss in NRW is a blow to her little more than six
months into her second term in office, meaning she will have to
rely on opposition parties to pass her policy agenda, which had
included billions of euros in planned income tax cuts.
 However, following criticism that the cuts could not be
justified due to Germany's stretched finances, Merkel said on
Monday it may have been a mistake to press hard for them and
that she now saw no scope for them before 2013 at the earliest.
 The outcome of the NRW vote made it uncertain who would form
the next government in the state, though it was clear that the
Christian Democrat-FDP coalition Merkel leads in Berlin would
not be able to continue the partnership at the local level.
 Speculation grew she may also have to reshuffle her cabinet
if the health of her finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, does
not improve, though the government denied this.
 Merkel urged European policymakers to attack the euro's
problems at the root by cutting back their budget deficits.
 ""We have to fight the causes of the difficulties, so budget
consolidation in all member states is increasingly important,""
the chancellor said. ""The access to the guarantees ... will be
linked to countries presenting budget consolidation programmes
to the IMF and the EU, which will then be regularly inspected.""
 German Vice Chancellor Guido Westerwelle, who as FDP leader
was blamed by many for his party's poor showing in NRW, said
financial markets had to be regulated to prevent speculation.
 ""Above all, it is important that those who are attacking the
euro as a currency know since yesterday that we are willing and
ready and capable of fending off these attacks,"" he said.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rallied from last week's
14-month low against the dollar on Monday after policymakers
agreed on a $1 trillion emergency package to stabilise the euro
and euro zone central banks began buying local government debt.
 The aid package, hammered out by European Union finance
ministers, central bankers and the International Monetary Fund,
was the biggest since Group of 20 leaders rolled out support
measures after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
 The plan calmed investor nerves after contagion fears
triggered a global rout in equities and other risky assets last
week, leading to a broad rally in the euro and equities.
 Central banks in Finland, Germany and France confirmed euro
zone central banks have started buying government bonds.
 Uncertainty persisted however, over whether the package
would give the euro lasting support since Greece and other
peripheral euro zone countries must tackle fiscal deficits when
their growth outlook is deteriorating.
 ""The package announced yesterday was supportive of euro
sentiment. There is some uncertainty lingering about the
mechanisms of the stabilisation funds, however. In particular,
it is still unclear where the money for the funds is going to
come from,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at
Societe Generale.
 ""In the case of Greece, very protracted economic recovery
could lead to more funding needs.""
 By 0945 GMT the euro was up 2.3 percent at $1.3056, having
fallen to $1.2510 on trading platform EBS last week. The euro
was on track for making its biggest one-day gain since November
2008.
 Mounting short positions on the euro prompted investors to
cover their positions, helping the single currency recover.
 Latest data from CFTC showed currency speculators boosted
bets in favour of the dollar to a level strategists said was the
highest since the euro's launch in 1999.
 The single currency is still down nearly 9 percent since
January, making it the worst performing major currency.
 The euro rose 4.4 percent to 121.94 yen after hitting an
eight-year low near 110.44 last week.
 ""The current euro rally should not be confused with a
long-term trend change,"" BNP Paribas said in a note to clients.
 ""Currency reallocation has been an important factor driving
the euro higher over the past 10 years, but going forward we
expect central banks to stay sidelined as they wait
to see how this monetary experiment will progress.""
 The dollar fell 1.7 percent against a basket of major
currencies to 83.01. The U.S. Federal Reserve reopened currency
swap facilities with other major central banks on Sunday to ease
market strains in Europe.
 The Fed revived facilities established during the 2007-2008
financial crisis with the European Central Bank, and the central
banks of Canada, the UK and Switzerland.
 
 POLITICAL STALEMATE
 Sterling rose 1.3 percent to $1.4991, helped by a broader
recovery in risky assets, while it fell over 1 percent to 87.09
pence per euro.
 Britain's opposition Conservatives and Liberal Democrats
resumed talks on Monday to reach a deal to govern. Investors are
concerned a political stalemate will hamper efforts to tackle
the UK's huge public deficits.
 Such concerns pushed the pound to one-year lows of $1.4475
on Friday.
 ""The longer political leaders dilly-dally about the
leadership then sterling will stay under pressure,"" said David
Scutt, a FX trader at Arab Australia Bank in Sydney.
 The Bank of England is expected to leave interest rates at
0.5 percent and not to undertake further quantitative easing
purchases when it concludes its Monetary Policy Committee
meeting on Monday.

(Recasts with chairman comments and details)
 TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp, Japan's No.4
automaker, forecast flat operating profits this year, below
market expectations, as a firmer yen and turmoil in Europe
counter the impact of a sales increase led by India.
 The cautious outlook from Suzuki, 20 percent owned by
Germany's Volkswagen, followed similarly conservative guidance
from larger rival Honda Motor Co and raised concerns ahead of
earnings from heavyweight Toyota Motor Co on Tuesday.
 ""I hope Suzuki's pessimistic view toward the euro and the
European economy is very conservative,"" said Kazutaka Oshima,
President of Rakuten Investment Management.
 ""I am now concerned about Toyota's earnings tomorrow. I am
now worried how the crisis in Greece would have an impact on
Japanese car makers.""
 Suzuki has outperformed the industry in the past few years
as consumers around the world shift to smaller, more
fuel-efficient cars such as its Swift and Alto hatchbacks.
 Analysts said Suzuki would also benefit from recently
expanded capacity in its biggest market India -- at 1 million
units a year as of March -- before it adds another 250,000
units from April 2012 to cement its dominance in the
fast-growing Indian market.
 But a weaker euro originating from Greece's debt woes may
erode its profit.
 ""I am afraid the crisis may hit not only the euro, but also
the economy in entire Europe and other currencies,"" chairman
Osamu Suzuki told a news conference.
 ""It may sound I am praying to God for help, but I wish the
negative impact on the economy would be limited.""
 For the year to March 31, 2011, Suzuki forecast an
operating profit of 80 billion yen ($874 million), 0.8 percent
up from the 79.36 billion yen it made last year. It expects net
profit to grow 3.8 percent to 30 billion yen.
 A survey of 18 brokerages by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S showed
that on average they expect operating profit of 88 billion yen
for 2010/11.
 Led by the Indian market, Suzuki expects to boost its
global vehicle sales by 5.7 percent to 2.482 million units this
financial year.
 But the firm forecast a stronger yen would have a negative
impact of 24 billion yen in its operating profit. Suzuki
assumes the yen to average 90 to the dollar and 115 to the
euro, compared with current levels around 93 and 121.
 INDIA MARGINS PRESSURED
 Operating profit in the final, January-March quarter was
29.5 billion yen, compared with a profit of 10.45 billion yen a
year earlier. The result was better than the 19.2 billion yen
average estimate in the poll of brokerages.
 Fourth-quarter net profit came to 13.4 billion yen versus a
profit of 5.8 billion yen a year ago.
 Last month, Indian unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd missed
forecasts for fourth-quarter net profit and warned of margin
pressure and slower sales growth as global automakers pile into
the competitive compact car market.
 Suzuki must also repair its ailing motorcycle business,
which unlike Honda successful operations, has yet to recover
from a sales slump as consumers stay away from leisure
products.
 Further out, analysts are looking for Suzuki to realise
synergies from its tie-up with Volkswagen.
 ""When we announced the tie-up, I assumed it would take a
year to discuss between the two companies what we would do. We
are in talks, but nothing has been decided,"" said the chairman.
 Suzuki's shares have fallen more than 20 percent since it
agreed its deal with Volkswagen last December, underperforming
a 1 percent rise in Tokyo's transport equipment subindex over
the same period.
 Before the announcement, Suzuki's shares closed up 1.5
percent at 1,858 yen, matching the market's rise.

 ""According to my information, he should be released from the
hospital today,"" Merkel said at a news conference in Berlin
called to discuss the European Union emergency loan package
aimed at preventing a sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone.
 ""I believe his health has improved greatly,"" she added.
 The 67-year-old Schaeuble, who has been wheelchair-bound

 The setback was the latest in a string of health scares for
Schaeuble, one of the most experienced figures in German
politics, who is widely seen as having taken a more pro-European
line than the chancellor in efforts to stabilise the euro.
 Ongoing concerns about his health have forced the government
to quell speculation it could have to reshuffle the cabinet to
replace Schaeuble. His absence over the weekend has reignited

 Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who deputised for
Schaeuble in Brussels, is seen as a possible replacement.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Financial markets climbed away
from a potential abyss on Monday after the European Union and
International Monetary Fund agreed a bumper rescue package to
prevent a sovereign debt crisis spreading.
 World stocks rose nearly 3 percent, the euro gained nearly 2
percent on the dollar and corporate and peripheral debt yields
narrowed sharply against benchmarks.
 Wall Street looked set to join in with a strong start.
 Although some questions remained about how the aid package
would solve the euro zone's long-term imbalances, it was
embraced strongly by investors.
 ""Euro zone policymakers surprised probably even the most
optimistic observers by presenting a quick and forceful,
unprecedented crisis package,"" ING said in a note.
 ""It does not solve the fundamental fiscal problems but it
gives countries now several years.""
 The package agreed earlier on Monday pledged 500 billion
euros ($670 billion) of loans and loan guarantees to any euro
zone countries needing funds, plus about 250 billion euros from
the IMF.
 It was a package on the scale of the $700 billion Troubled
Asset Relief Program (TARP) launched by the United States to
fend off the financial crisis of 2007-2009.
 There were also measures by central banks to address funding
strains and a European Central Bank plan to buy the region's
government bonds.
 A number of European central banks said they had already
started.
 The moves followed sharp sell offs in riskier assets across
the world last week prompted by fears that Greece's struggle to
avoid default on its debt would spread to other euro zone
economies and potentially elsewhere.
 Global stocks as measured by MSCI were up 2.8 percent with
its emerging market-only counterpart jumping more than 3
percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300, having fallen to $1.2510
on trading platform EBS last week.
 Mounting short positions on the euro prompted investors to
cover their positions, helping the single currency recover. It
was not clear, however, whether investors would turn long on the
currency.
 Some questions remained about the package, however.
 ""It is still unclear where the money for the funds is going
to come from,"" said Valentin Marinov, currency strategist at
Societe Generale.
 On bond markets, the premiums investors demand to buy
peripheral euro zone government bonds rather than German
benchmarks fell.
 The Greek/German 10-year bond yield spread narrowed sharply
and the cost of insuring peripheral economy debt fell.
 Liquidity in Greek bonds dried up last week with no trades
going through.
 There was little sign, meanwhile, that British assets were
being driven by anything other than the global sentiment
following a weekend of negotiations to try to create a
government.

 By Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan joined forces
with the world's major central banks on Monday to re-establish a
dollar swap facility with the U.S. Federal Reserve to ease
strains in credit markets rattled by Greece's debt woes.
 Concerns about debt burdens in European countries have
rattled financial markets globally, and European Union finance
ministers, central bankers and the International Monetary Fund
agreed an emergency rescue package worth about $1 trillion in
marathon talks at the weekend.
 Central banks set up the dollar swap arrangements with the
Fed on the understanding that funding strains in Europe may
destabilise global financial markets, Bank of Japan Deputy
Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi said.
 ""During the post-Lehman shock period, dollar funding dried
up. Compared with that, things are more stable even though dollar
liquidity has shrunk in Europe,"" Yamaguchi, one of the BOJ's two
deputy governors, told a news conference after an emergency BOJ
policy meeting to reinstate the facility.
 ""But strains from shrinking liquidity that we're already
seeing could spread globally and destabilise world financial
markets in the future. That's the understanding behind our
decision today.""
 The BOJ also said it would introduce dollar fund supply
operations.
 It offered to supply 2 trillion yen ($21.8 billion) of
same-day funds early on Monday after conducting a similar
operation on Friday. The operation drew bids for only 694.5
billion yen, however, showing demand for short-term yen funds
remains tepid.
 It is the first time the BOJ has offered same-day funds for
two business days in a row since October 2008, when credit
markets froze up in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 Masamichi Adachi, senior economist at JPMorgan Securities
Japan, said it was not clear to him why the BOJ needed to supply
2 trillion yen in funds for two days in a row.
 ""The bank may say that it must remain cautious given the
current market turmoil, but the offer on Friday did not draw much
in bids.""
 The BOJ set no limit on the amount of funds that can be drawn
in the dollar swap with the Fed and said the duration of loans in
the swap facility wouldn't exceed three months, a statement it
issued after an emergency meeting showed.
 Japan's central bank also voted unanimously to keep its
benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent.
 The BOJ saw no need to change its economic outlook because of
Greece's fiscal discipline crisis, Yamaguchi said.
 BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa wasn't present at the
emergency meeting as he was in Switzerland to attend a Bank of
International Settlements meeting.
 The euro rose and Asian stocks jumped on Monday after the EU
rescue package was announced. Japanese government bond prices
also fell as the Nikkei average gained 1.6 percent in a sign
worries about Greece's fiscal woes are easing.
 Fears of a meltdown in Europe caused global stock markets to
tumble in panic selling and sent the euro to a 14-month low last
week. The Greek debt crisis drove its bond yields and insurance
on its debt to record levels. Financial markets had started to
punish other euro zone debt of members with bloated budgets such
as Portugal, Spain and Ireland.
 The Fed reopened currency swap facilities with other major
central banks on Sunday to help ease market strains in Europe,
reviving arrangements set up during the 2007-2008 financial
crisis with the European Central Bank, the banks of Canada and
England and the Swiss National Bank.
 Major central banks took action after interbank rates for
euro and dollar loans started to creep higher, reminding many
investors and policymakers of the credit crunch that afflicted
the global economy after the subprime crisis.
 The ECB also said it will buy euro zone government bonds for
the first time to help support fractured markets, abandoning its
resistance to full-scale asset purchases.
 The ECB said the scope of the purchases was yet to be
determined, but added they would be offset by liquidity-absorbing
operations so that monetary policy is unaffected.

 REUTERS FORECASTS:
 - All of 22 analysts polled see the Bank of Korea holding
its benchmark interest rate steady at a record-low 2.00 percent
for a 15th consecutive month. The rate was cut by 325 basis
points over four months until February 2009.
 - Nineteen predict a rate increase in the second half of
the year -- 10 in the third quarter and eight in the fourth
quarter while one was undecided. Two see a rise as early as
June while one expects a hike in the first quarter of 2011.
 - In the last Reuters poll conducted soon after the central
bank's news conference on April 9, 16 out of 17 analysts saw a
raise in the second half or early next year, while one
predicted an increase in the first half.
 By Cheon Jong-woo
 SEOUL, May 10 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank looks
certain to start raising interest rates in the second half,
although the timing could be delayed if the euro zone debt
crisis deteriorates while local inflation stays tame.
 Last month, strong economic data had bolstered the case for
an early interest rate increase but lingering concerns about
the global fallout from the euro zone's debt crisis is playing
an offsetting role, analysts said.
 On Monday, the European Union agreed on a 500 billion-euro
emergency fund to protect highly indebted euro zone countries
from the ""wolfpack"" of financial markets, but analysts remained
sceptical it was over.
 Reflecting the changing views, June treasury bond futures
have rebounded to 111.22 from 110.54 on April 14 when the
government provided a strong outlook on employment.
 South Korea's annual consumer inflation rate is gathering
some steam but is still below the middle point of the central
bank's target band of 2-4 percent.
 Last month, the Bank of Korea reinforced the market's view
that it would keep interest rates until the U.S. or Chinese
central banks begin to lift their rates.
 Analysts had priced in an imminent interest rate increase
late last year after former Governor Lee Seong-tae warned of
mounting asset price bubbles, but have since kept pushing back
the timing for a raise in line with his changes in rhetoric.
 Here are some possible outcomes from the Bank of Korea's
monetary policy committee meeting and subsequent news
conference by Governor Kim Choong-soo, and the expected market
reaction:
 FLAGS NO IMMINENT RAISE
 Governor Kim will most likely maintain dovish signals that
the central bank will hold interest rates steady for a while by
emphasising that the global economy is faced with more risks
from the debt crisis in Europe.
 Kim is also expected to indicate that the country still
needs to maintain easier policy because inflationary pressure
is not rising high enough to pose an immediate threat.
 * Probability: very high (more than 90 percent, or 20 of
the 22 analysts polled)
 * Market reaction: Bond and stock prices will likely rise
but gains will be limited because investors have already priced
in little chance of a rate rise in the first half.
 FLAGS RISE IN NEAR TERM
 There still is a slim chance of Kim sending signals of a
near-term rate hike, given the healthy economic data, and by
showing his support for his predecessor's long-held view that
keeping interest rates too low for a long time is not
desirable.
 Earlier this month, data showed inflation and manufacturing
activity picked up in April. Exports value per working day last
month hit a 19-month high and March industrial output rose by
double the pace analysts had expected.
 Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun also said last week there
were a lot of problems attached to keeping rates low, which
some analysts took as an early hint that he was not quite so
opposed to a rate increase.
 * Probability: very low (2 out of the 22 analysts in the
poll).
 * Market reaction: Bond and stock prices will likely fall
sharply while the won will gain as the unexpectedly hawkish
comments from the dovish-looking governor will prompt investors
to rush to rebuild bets on an early tightening. (Additional

1426,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2010 03:16AM ET</span>",Greece gives China a window for yuan reform -Citi," * Greece woes lessen worries about speculative inflows
 * China may announce peg to undisclosed basket -Citigroup
 * Economists see no need for big appreciation
 BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - Global market turmoil in the wake
of Greece's debt woes presents China with a ""unique opportunity""
to reform the yuan, Citigroup economists said on Monday.
 A weaker euro and China's narrowing trade surplus have both
reduced the need for a stronger yuan and thus suggest that any
appreciation will be very modest, Ken Peng and Shen Minggao said
in a note to clients.
 ""But the risk-off environment provides a unique opportunity
for authorities to modify the currency regime independent of
external pressure,"" they added.
 The government was likely to announced a managed float
regime of pegging the yuan to an undisclosed basket of
currencies, they said. Under the current system, the yuan's
exchange rate is managed with reference to a basket of currencies
and is not formally pegged to it.
 China has held the yuan steady at about 6.83 to the dollar
since mid-2008 to cushion the economy from the global financial
crisis.
 A fear of attracting hot money inflows is one of the reasons
that Beijing has been reluctant to let the yuan resume
appreciation. The government also appeared to dig in its heels
when confronted in recent months by an onslaught of foreign calls
for a stronger exchange rate.
 Both of these inhibiting factors have subsided somewhat, the
Citi economists said.
 As investors tilt towards risk aversion, a move on the yuan
may not suck in too much speculative capital. Moreover, Beijing
would not appear to be bowing to foreign pressure with so much
attention now focused on the Greek crisis and not the yuan's role
in causing global economic imbalances.
 Many analysts believe that worries about a contagion
spreading from the Greek debt crisis could prompt China to act
slowly in letting the yuan appreciate. [ID:nTOE64605W] Chinese
government advisers have said that Greece's woes would not derail
exchange rate reform. [ID:nTOE64402Z]
 Reduced expectations for appreciation were visible last week
in the offshore forwards market, when prices implied predictions
of just a 0.8 percent yuan rise over the next 12 months.
 Those forwards are now pricing in about a 1.7 percent gain,
below the roughly 3 percent level that was the consistent
expectation earlier this year. [ID:nTOE649045]

 * Trade surplus widens to 13.3 bln euro vs forecast 14.0 bln
 * Analysts say Greek debt crisis shadows trade in Europe

(Adds details, background, analyst comment)
 By Sarah Marsh and Dave Graham
 BERLIN, May 10 (Reuters) - German exports surged at their
fastest rate in nearly 18 years in March, surpassing even the
most optimistic forecast as Europe's largest economy shifted up
a gear after stumbling over an unusually cold winter.
 Analysts said foreign demand was powering Germany's recovery
and could have pushed first quarter gross domestic product into
positive territory.
 They cautioned however that the euro zone crisis and
pressure to consolidate budgets could put the brakes on exports
in the months ahead.
 ""The German economy is getting a significant boost from
exports,"" said Klaus Schruefer from SEB. ""Wednesday's GDP
figures could end up being better than expected.""
 Economists have previously forecast German GDP figures, due
for release on Wednesday, to show the economy stagnating in the
first three months of 2010.
 ""But we need to remain a bit cautious,"" added Schruefer. ""We
export a lot to other euro zone nations. The pressure to
consolidate public finances could therefore put a brake on
Germany's future exports.""
 Adjusted for seasonal swings, German exports rose 10.7
percent month-on-month to 79.0 billion euros ($106 billion), the
largest jump since July 1992, according to Bundesbank data.
 Exports had been expected to rise by 2.6 percent, with 4.1
percent the highest forecast.
 Imports also gained more than expected, up 11.0 percent to
65.7 billion euros versus a forecast for a 0.3 percent rise, the
Federal Statistics Office said.
This yielded a trade surplus with the rest of the world of
13.3 billion euros in March, up from 12.1 billion euros in
February. A reading of 14.0 billion euros had been forecast.
 ""The recovery in German trade has significantly gained
steam, but there are new issues casting a shadow over it,"" said
Anton Boerner, the head of the BGA exporters' group. 
 ""Price stability is decisive for German trade...the Greek
debt crisis is therefore making us very worried.""
 
 SPRING CORRECTION
 Foreign trade is expected to play a major role in the
recovery in Germany, which was the world's biggest exporter of
goods from 2003 to 2008, before being overtaken by China.
 ""The German economy has picked up speed, particularly the
manufacturing sector,"" said Juergen Michels at Citigroup.
 Germany exited its deepest post-war recession in the second
quarter of last year but the recovery stalled through the winter
when harsh weather disrupted business activity.
 Recent economic indicators have pointed to the recovery
picking up again, with data last week showing industrial output
and orders surging in March.
 In addition, German business morale surged in April to its
highest level in nearly two years.
 However, economists said the March rise in exports was
partly a correction from last year's drastic figures and the
difficult winter months. Exports posted their biggest drop in a
year in January, shocking analysts.
 ""This massive increase is also partly down to the fact that
we're seeing a correction to the impact of the weather. At the
start of the year, the harsh winter held things back,"" said
Michels at Citigroup.
 ""Things aren't going to continue at this pace. But the
increase in orders suggest that the export motor will be turning
over at a pretty brisk pace in the next few months.""

 By Umesh Desai
 HONG KONG, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded from
14-month lows and Asian stocks jumped on Monday after the
European Union and IMF carved out an emergency rescue package
of up to 750 billion euros ($1 trillion) to keep Greece's debt
crisis from spreading through the euro zone.
 The size of the package and an unexpected pledge by the
European Central Bank to buy euro zone bonds if needed gave
investors some confidence to return to riskier assets such as
stocks, though questions remained about how the scheme would
work. [ID:nN09270819]
 Major global central banks moved swiftly to support Europe,
re-establishing dollar swap facilities used during the
2007-2008 financial crisis to help ease strains and ensure
there was enough liquidity to keep global credit markets from
seizing up again.
 ""These measures are a game changer in the near to medium
term,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist for
SJS Markets, adding the aid package was big enough to deter
speculation in the short term about a Greek debt default.
 Others agreed the move had at least bought Europe some time
as it tries to calm markets, but High Frequency Economics said
in a research note that the package was ""still too vague to
understand"".
 The euro rose to as high as $1.2982  by
mid-afternoon, up around 1.7 percent and pulling away from a
14-month low of $1.2510 hit on trading platform EBS last week.
 European and U.S. stocks were also seen opening higher.
 Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> and
France's CAC 40 <.FCHI> was seen up as much as 2.8 percent,
according to financial bookmakers. S&P futures  rose
nearly 3 percent.
 But gains in Asia were tempered by caution about how the
emergency package will be funded and concerns about longer term
structural problems in the euro zone.
 The MSCI ex-Japan index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 3.1 percent,
while Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended up 1.6 percent but off the
day's high.
 The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index fell for five straight days
last week for a loss of 8.4 percent, wiping out its gains so
far this year and its highest percentage weekly loss since
November 2008.
 ""Investors now want to see how European and U.S. stocks
perform overnight. Caution also remains as reasons behind the
abnormal slide in U.S. stocks last week still haven't been
identified,"" said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at Daiwa
Securities Capital Markets.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> suffered a so far
unexplained plunge of nearly 1,000 points at one point on
Thursday as Greece's debt problems intensified.
 Though Wall Street later recouped most of the sharp losses,
with traders initially suspecting a technical glitch,
investors' nerves remain frayed by the extreme volatility in
recent days.
 Kowalczyk said global risky assets -- equities,
commodities and emerging market assets -- would be boosted by
the latest EU support measures but added the euro will soon
slip again because of the liquidity boost provided by ECB.
 The ECB surprised analysts by saying it will buy euro zone
government bonds to help support fractured markets, abandoning
its resistance to full-scale asset purchases. [ID:nLDE64901W]
 While some analysts had urged the central bank to push such
a financial ""nuclear button"" to defuse the escalating debt
crisis, others said buying bonds could be tantamount to
printing money to finance Greece's fiscal deficit.
[ID:nSGE649024]
 Before the European announcement, data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed euro sceptics' bets against
the common currency hit a record high in the week ending May 4.
[IMM/FX]
 Financial markets have been punishing heavily indebted euro
zone members, threatening to plunge them into the same sort of
crisis as Greece, which could derail the global economic
recovery.
 The new safety net was meant to protect other countries
with bloated budgets, such as Portugal, Spain and Ireland.
 As jitters over euro zone finances battered global markets,
investors have dumped riskier assets for safer ones such as the
U.S. dollar, creating fears of dollar shortages in some
countries and driving up dollar funding costs.
 ""While the ECB's intervention (in bond markets) might
attract bad press regarding its mandate and independence, we
believe that this was necessary to short circuit the negative
feedback loop which was getting more and more threatening for
the global economy,"" the Royal Bank of Scotland said in a
research note.
 ""Sceptics will probably argue that this does not solve the
medium term debt overhang issues plaguing the periphery (other
weak euro zone countries). However they won't deny that this
will give them a chance to implement some fiscal consolidation
plans to restore market confidence in the sustainability of
public finances in the euro area.""
 Oil  rose 3 percent to above $77 a barrel on hopes
that the EU deal will prevent broader damage to Europe's
economy which would have dampened energy demand.

percent against a basket of major world currencies <.DXY>.

optimism about the plan, adding to Friday's losses after the

in April, suggesting the economic recovery was well underway.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Monday on news
of an emergency package to prevent Greece's debt crisis from
spreading to other euro zone countries, although scepticism
lingered about the possibility of a sustained rebound.
 The European Union's package, which may reach 750 billion
euros ($957 billion) with IMF support, was seen likely to help
ease worries about Greece's problems in the near term and
concerns about the debt crisis spreading within the euro zone.
 Meanwhile, news of central banks launching dollar swap lines
in response to recent strains in dollar funding markets, as well
as a European Central Bank plan to buy euro zone government
bonds, helped give a lift to equities and weighed on the yen.
 It was unclear if the rebound in risky assets and the euro
would be sustained, however.
 ""These all seem like stopgap measures aimed at treating
symptoms,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan at
Barclays Capital.
 ""They are not the type of steps that will fix the root
problems,"" Yamamoto said, adding that it remains unclear if
efforts to curb large fiscal deficits in Greece and some other
euro zone countries will proceed smoothly.
 The euro climbed 1.3 percent to $1.2919 after it touched the
day's high of around $1.2970, pulling away from a 14-month low of
$1.2510 hit on trading platform EBS last week.
 With its rise, the euro inched above resistance near the
$1.2940 to $1.2950 region. A 50 percent retracement of the euro's
fall last week to $1.2510 from $1.3365 lies near such levels and
a cluster of previous support points also lie in that region.
 The euro jumped 2.5 percent to 119.68 yen, up sharply from an
eight-year low of 110.49 yen hit last week.
 ""Since there had been some speculative selling of the euro,
it would be natural for some short-covering to emerge,"" said
Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchange at State Street Global
Markets in Tokyo.
 ""But the euro's credibility has been damaged, so it's hard to
expect it to immediately start rising firmly,"" Tomita said.
 Latest data shows that currency speculators have boosted bets
against the euro to a record high.
 YEN RETREATS
 Fears of a meltdown in the euro zone had been driving
investors to yen and the dollar, considered safe-haven
investments when risk aversion spikes.
 But the yen retreated on Monday as such concerns ebbed,
falling against currencies such as the high-yielding Australian
dollar.
 The U.S. dollar climbed 1.2 percent to 92.64 yen.
 Worries about whether Greece will actually be able to carry
out strict fiscal austerity measures are likely to linger, said
Minoru Shioiri, a chief manager of FX trading at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanely Securities.
 Two polls showed on Saturday that a majority of Greeks
support further protests against austerity measures agreed by the
government in exchange for billions of euros in EU and IMF aid.
 Sterling regained ground, bouncing from one-year lows of
$1.4475 on Friday. It rose 0.3 percent to $1.4863.
 Britain's Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will hold
further talks on Monday to try and stitch together a deal to
govern with markets anxious about how the new government will go
about addressing the precarious state of public finances..
 ""The longer political leaders dillydally about the leadership
then sterling will stay under pressure,"" said David Scutt, a
forex trader at Arab Australia Bank in Sydney.
 ""Let's see if they learn from the mistakes made by the
continental leaders.""
 The Bank of England is seen likely to leave interest rates at
0.5 percent and not to undertake any further quantitative easing
purchases when it concludes its Monetary Policy Committee meeting
on Monday.

 BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - China returned to familiar

policymakers fearful of another round of global economic

 China recorded a $1.7 billion trade surplus last month,
defying expectations for a second straight deficit after
March's $7.2 billion shortfall.
 But if a trade surplus is the normal state of affairs for
the world's largest exporting nation, the new normal could be
smaller surpluses, reflecting China's growing domestic demand
and the relatively frail health of the world's other major
economies.
 Exports rose an annual 30.5 percent in April, topping
forecasts for 28.9 percent growth. Imports were up 49.7 percent
from a year earlier, compared with predictions for a 53.8
percent increase.
 ""Expectations for yuan appreciation will continue to exist,
but April's strong export figure alone will not have a big
impact on timing,"" said Sun Wencun, an economist with CITIC
Securities in Beijing.
 China has frozen its currency against the dollar since
mid-2008, trying to cushion its exporters from the global
financial crisis.
 Speculation had swirled in recent weeks that it was only a
matter of time before Beijing let the exchange rate resume
appreciation, but many analysts believe that international
jitters in the wake of Greece's debt crisis could stay its
hand.
 ""These (trade) numbers largely pre-date the escalation of
the euro-area sovereign debt crisis and the sharp sell-off in
the euro, so it is still too soon to tell whether we will see
weaker European demand for Chinese exports in the months
ahead,"" Brian Jackson, an economist with the Royal Bank of
Canada in Hong Kong, said in a note.
 BACK TO SURPLUS
 China's leaders have said they want to be sure that
external demand has made a sustained recovery before unwinding
policies introduced at the height of the global credit crunch,
including the yuan's de facto peg and a range of tax rebates
given to exporters.
 But the world's third-largest economy slipped into a trade
deficit in March -- its first in six years -- more because of
domestic vigour than external weakness.
 With China growing 11.9 percent in the first quarter from a
year ago, its appetite for energy and raw materials has been
voracious.
 April may prove something of an inflection point, with base
effects over the rest of the year likely to push export growth
rates higher, while the pace of import increases slows.
 Exports rose 11.4 percent in month-on-month calendar
adjusted terms, while imports were up 6.9 percent, the Chinese
customs authority said.
 Goldman Sachs economists Yu Song and Helen Qiao estimated
that on a seasonally adjusted annualised month-on-month basis,
exports grew around 25 percent and imports fell about 18
percent.
 ""We continue to believe the trade deficit (in March) was a
one-off event and the trade surplus will likely increase
throughout the year,"" they said.
 Grace Ng, an economist with J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong,
forecast that China would run a $100 billion trade surplus this
year, down from a $196 billion surplus in 2009.
 ""We've been saying that the March trade deficit was
temporary. We are looking for the full-year trade balance to
come back into a solid balance situation,"" she said.

 * ECB plans to buy euro zone government bonds
 * C.banks reestablish dollar swap scheme
 * But worries about fiscal deficits in euro zone may linger
 * Euro faces resistance near $1.2950
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rallied on Monday on news
of an emergency package to prevent Greece's debt crisis from
spreading to other euro zone countries, although scepticism
lingered about the possibility of a sustained rebound.
 The European Union's package, which may reach 750 billion
euros with IMF support, was seen likely to help ease worries
about Greece's problems in the near-term and concerns about a
spread of a debt crisis within the euro zone.
 Meanwhile, news of central banks launching dollar swap lines
to ease recent strains in dollar funding markets, and a European
Central Bank plan to buy euro zone government bonds helped give a
lift to equities and weighed on the yen.
 It was unclear whether the rebound in risky assets and the
euro would persist, however.
 ""These all seem like stopgap measures aimed at treating
symptoms,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist Japan at
Barclays Capital.
 ""They are not the type of steps that will fix the root
problems,"" Yamamoto said, adding that it remains unclear whether
efforts to curb large fiscal deficits in Greece and some other
euro zone countries will proceed smoothly.
 The euro climbed 1.6 percent to $1.2954, pulling away from a
14-month low of $1.2510 hit on trading platform EBS last week.
 With its rise, the euro inched above resistance near the
$1.2940 to $1.2950 region. The 50 percent retracement of the
euro's fall last week from $1.3365 to $1.2510 lies near such
levels and a cluster of previous support also lie in that region.
 The euro jumped 2.7 percent to 120.00 yen, up sharply from an
eight-year low of 110.49 yen hit last week.
 In a sign of the yen's broad decline, the dollar climbed 1.2
percent to 92.63 yen.
 Fears of a meltdown in the euro zone had been driving
investors to the safety of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar,
considered safe-haven investments when risk aversion spikes.
 Worries about whether Greece will actually be able to carry
out strict fiscal austerity measures are likely to linger, said
Minoru Shioiri, a chief manager of FX trading at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanely Securities.
 ""If Greece does nothing, it will just turn into losses for
Germany and France,"" Shioiri said.
 Sterling regained ground, bouncing from one-year lows of
$1.4475 on Friday. It rose 0.5 percent to $1.4888.
 Britain's Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will hold
further talks on Monday to try and stitch together a deal to
govern with markets anxious about how the new government will go
about addressing the precarious state of public finances..
 ""The longer political leaders dilly dally about the
leadership, then sterling will stay under pressure,"" said David
Scutt, forex trader at Arab Australia Bank in Sydney
 ""Lets see if they learn from the mistakes made by the
continental leaders.""

 By Umesh Desai
 HONG KONG, May 10 (Reuters) - The euro rose and Asian
stocks jumped on Monday after the European Union and IMF carved
out an emergency loan package of up to 750 billion euros ($1
trillion) to keep Greece's debt crisis from spreading through
the euro zone.
 The size of the package and an unexpected pledge by the
European Central Bank to buy euro zone bonds if needed gave
investors some confidence to return to riskier assets such as
stocks, though questions remained about how the scheme would
work.
 Major global central banks moved swiftly to support Europe,
re-establishing dollar swap facilities used during the
2007-2008 financial crisis to help ease strains on financial
markets and ensure there was enough liquidity to keep global
credit markets from seizing up again.
 ""These measures are a game changer in the near to medium
term,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist for
SJS Markets, adding the aid package was big enough to deter
speculation in the short term about Greek debt default.
 The euro rose as high as $1.2950 on news of the deal before
slipping back after the ECB abandoned its resistance to
full-scale purchases of euro zone government and private bonds.
 While some analysts had urged the central bank to push such
a
financial ""nuclear button"" to defuse the escalating debt
crisis, others said buying bonds could be tantamount to
printing money to finance Greece's fiscal deficit.
 By late morning, the single currency was up 1.3 percent on
the day at $1.2920 and was 1.5 percent higher against the yen
at 118.55 yen
 The MSCI world stock index rose 0.8 percent, with the MSCI
Asia ex-Japan index up 2 percent and Japan's Nikkei up 1.6
percent.
 U.S. S&P futures jumped 2.7 percent.
 Kowalczyk said global risky assets -- equities,
commodities and emerging market assets -- would be boosted by
the latest support measures but added the euro will soon slip
again because of the liquidity boost provided by ECB.
 Financial markets have been punishing heavily indebted euro
zone members, threatening to plunge them into the same sort of
crisis as Greece, which could jeopardise the nascent global
economic recovery.
 The new safety net was meant to protect other countries
with bloated budgets, such as Portugal, Spain and Ireland.
 Jitters over euro zone finances have battered global
markets as investors dumped riskier assets for safer ones such
as the U.S. dollar, creating fears of dollar shortages in some
countries and driving up dollar funding costs.
 ""While the ECB's intervention (in bond markets) might
attract bad press regarding its mandate and independence, we
believe that this was necessary to short circuit the negative
feedback loop which was getting more and more threatening for
the global economy,"" the Royal Bank of Scotland said in a
research note.
 ""Sceptics will probably argue that this does not solve the
medium term debt overhang issues plaguing the periphery (other
weak euro zone countries). However they won't deny that this
will give them a chance to implement some fiscal consolidation
plans to restore market confidence in the sustainability of
public finances in the euro area.""
 Before the European announcement, data from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed euro sceptics' bets against
the common currency hit a record high in the week ending May 4.
 Oil rose 2.3 percent to $76.86 a barrel on hopes that the
EU deal will prevent broader damage to Europe's economy which
would have dampened energy demand.
 Gold softened to $1,198.20 an ounce, down from a near
record-high of $1,213.35 hit Friday.
 The U.S. dollar was firmer against the yen at 92.61 and
well off Friday's five-month lows of 88.00. It was down 1
percent against a basket of major world currencies
 U.S. Treasuries were broadly weaker amid optimism about the
plan, adding to Friday's losses after the U.S. Labor Dept
reported larger-than-expected employment gains in April,
suggesting the economic recovery was well underway.

 By Mark Felsenthal
 WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve
reopened currency swap facilities with other major central
banks on Sunday to help ease market strains in Europe.
 The Fed revived facilities established during the 2007-2008
financial crisis with the European Central Bank, the banks of
Canada and England, and the Swiss National Bank.
 ""These facilities are designed to help improve liquidity
conditions in U.S. dollar funding markets and to prevent the
spread of strains to other markets and financial centers,"" the
Fed said in a statement.
 The Fed will provide dollar swaps for the ECB, the Bank of
England and the Swiss National Bank with no upper limit against
fixed collateral, as was the case with facilities that had
expired Feb. 1.
 The Fed said the swap facility with Canada would support
drawings of up to $30 billion.
 The renewed swap arrangements will run until January 2011,
the Fed said.
 As a credit crunch brought about by the collapse of U.S.
housing markets and a tidal wave of mortgage defaults escalated
in late 2007, the Fed announced swap lines with the ECB and the
SNB to help ease U.S. dollar funding pressures in Europe as the
credit crisis deepened.
 The announcement was part of a coordinated effort among
several major central banks to calm roiled markets.
 Over subsequent months, the Fed vastly expanded the
initially dose of $20 billion for the ECB and $5 billion for
the SNB.
 The U.S. central bank eventually said it would provide the
ECB and the central banks of England, Japan and Switzerland
""any amount they wish against fixed collateral.""
 By the time the program was shuttered, U.S. authorities had
opened swap lines with Canada, Norway, Australia, Sweden, New
Zealand, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and Singapore.
 However, with renewed upheaval over worries about contagion
from the Greek debt crisis, financial market participants urged
the Fed to reestablish the swap lines to ensure access to
dollar funding.
 In a development reminiscent of the early stages of the
previous crisis, the cost of interbank three-month U.S. dollar
funds posted the sharpest rise in 16 months on Friday.

 * Global situation warrants conservative fiscal policy
(Adds comments, background)
 By Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, May 9 (Reuters) - Hungary's current inflation
trajectory does not necessitate stricter monetary conditions,
including a stronger currency, the central bank governor said
on Sunday.
 ""According to our current forecast, inflation in 2011 will
be below the target of 3 percent,"" National Bank of Hungary
Governor Andras Simor told public television m1.
 ""In this respect, the National Bank of Hungary does not
deem necessary stricter monetary conditions, meaning, it does
not deem necessary a stronger (forint) exchange rate.""
 The forint lost 4.4 percent in the past week to trade at
around 280 to the euro.
 ""Obviously the weakening of the exchange rate can, to some
extent, accelerate inflation,"" Simor added. ""Obviously we have
to see what kind of framework we need to keep that within a
normal range.""
 OVERSIZED RISKS
 Simor said governments around Europe now face the same
problem banks faced in the earlier phases of the global
economic crisis: investors think they have taken on oversized
risks.
 ""After Greece, the market is looking: where else can a
country default on its debt obligations? A downward spiral like
that could cause very serious problems.""
 Every country has to look twice at the deficits and debt
levels it plans to run, he added.
 ""Today's situation warrants a very conservative, very
carefully considered fiscal policy,"" he said.
 He said the same was true to Hungary, where officials of
the next government, formed by the centre-right Fidesz party,
have said they planned to jumpstart growth through tax cuts and
grow out of the high deficit and debt levels that forced the
country to seek international aid in October 2008.
 ""We need a low budget deficit and we need to boost growth
at the same time,"" Simor said. The two are not impossible in
parallel.""
 He said that a Fidesz plan to convert the country's huge
stock of foreign currency loans to forints [ID:nLDE6461M0]
would potentially cost hundreds of billions of forints, and
that the best way to ease the exposure to currency fluctuations
would be to adopt the euro as soon as possible.
 In an article he published on Friday, Simor urged the new
government to offset any tax cuts with spending cuts, and get
public finances in order to create the sound economic base the
country needs to adopt the euro. [ID:nLDE64603A]
 Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary could adopt the euro
in 2015, as seen earlier, while the Czech Republic could join
the common currency in 2016, a year later than previously
forecast, according to the latest Reuters poll.

(Adds minister's condition, analyst, background)
 By Paul Carrel
 BERLIN, May 9 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble was admitted to hospital on Sunday after an apparent
bad reaction to new medicine, missing an EU meeting and raising
questions about his capacity to steer Europe's largest economy.
 Schaeuble, who has used a wheelchair since he was shot and
nearly killed by a mentally ill man in 1990, made it to Brussels
for the EU meeting but went to hospital after the medicine he
took on Saturday appeared to disagree with him.
 Schaeuble, 67, has been in and out of hospital several times
this year and last month missed international meetings in Madrid
and Washington due to healing complications following an
operation earlier in the year.
 His admission to the hospital in Brussels meant he missed
Sunday's meeting of European Union finance ministers at which
they defended the euro and sought to ring-fence Greece's debt
crisis to stop it spreading. [ID:nLDE64803B]
 ""The health of Mr Schaeuble is a point of discussion in
Berlin,"" said Gerd Langguth, political scientist at Bonn
University and biographer of Merkel.
 ""At a time like this you need a finance minister who can
work at full capacity without limits,"" he added.
 An official in Chancellor Angela Merkel's office said she
was not planning to reshuffle her cabinet after Schaeuble's was
admitted to hospital.
 Schaeuble was under observation in a Brussels hospital and
his state of health was not dramatic, his spokesman said.
 Some media have speculated that Hesse state premier Roland
Koch could be a possible successor to Schaeuble.
 However, Merkel confidante Interior Minister Thomas de
Maiziere was dispatched to Brussels to lead the German
delegation at Sunday's meeting. De Maiziere has also previously
been mentioned as a possible finance minister.
 Schaeuble has been at the forefront of German efforts to
find a solution to the Greece debt crisis and delivered an
impassioned speech to lawmakers on Friday, urging them to back a
bill to release aid to Athens -- which they did. [ID:nLDE6460QV]
 A surprise pick as finance minister last October, Schaeuble
is a hard-nosed and independent-minded political veteran who has
pursued a policy of budgetary rigour since taking the job.
 He is seen as one of the most talented German politicians of
his generation and may have become chancellor himself had he not
become ensnared in a funding scandal that damaged his Christian
Democrats and former mentor Helmut Kohl a decade ago.

euro ($40 billion) rescue loan for debt-stricken Greece, as
European finance ministers discussed ways to prevent market
turmoil from spreading.
 Worries about the risk that Greece's problems could spread
to other countries have made financial markets nervous and made
trading extremely volatile. Analysts have identified Portugal,
Spain and Ireland as countries that could follow in Greece's
footsteps and be forced to seek help.
 The meeting of the 24-member IMF board, made up of
representatives from the Fund's member countries, is part of a
European-led 110 billion euro financing plan for Greece to
avert the euro zone's first sovereign debt default.
 The bailout is the biggest in history and will be dispersed
over the course of three years. It comes with stringent
conditions that include a combination of spending cuts and
revenue increases.
 IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who will
present the Greece plan to the IMF board, has said he expects

Greece has a debt burden of more than 115 percent of gross

 * Monti sees link between threats to EU market, currency
 * Grand bargain would make tax, social concessions to France
 * Proposal designed to counter ""market fatigue"" in EU public
 By Paul Taylor
DUBLIN, May 9 (Reuters) - European Union elder statesman
Mario Monti will propose a grand bargain on Monday to reverse an
erosion of the bloc's single market due to the financial crisis
that is now shaking the euro common currency.
 The internal market of nearly 500 million consumers, built
on the principle of free movement of capital, goods, people and
services, is the cornerstone of EU prosperity. But economic
nationalism and emergency rescue measures taken since 2008 to
protect banks and car makers risk undermining it.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso mandated
the respected former EU competition and internal market chief
last year to devise a strategy to relaunch the single market and
build a new consensus for a competitive economy.
 Monti will hand his report to Barroso on Monday and it is
still under wraps. But in a series of speeches and articles, he
has sketched the outlines of a ""package deal"" of reciprocal
concessions by the EU's free marketeers and more socially-minded
countries such as France and Germany.
 In exchange for greater cooperation on tax policy, workers'
rights, public services and industrial policy, he argues, Paris
and Berlin would be more willing to open their energy, telecoms
and services markets to more cross-border competition.
 In a nod to the American revolution slogan, he says the EU
should embrace the idea of ""no taxation without coordination"".
He does not advocate tax harmonisation, anathema to Britain,
Ireland and east European states with low corporate taxes.
 Exactly 25 years after Jacques Delors launched a landmark
programme to complete the single market that dragged the EU out
of a period of ""Euroscelerosis"", Monti suggests using similar
methods to help revive a battered European economy.
 Fast-track legislation, majority voting by EU ministers on
new market liberalisation and swifter enforcement of the rules
by the European Commission would help sweep away obstacles to
competition, innovation and growth.
 
 ""MARKET FATIGUE""
 EU efforts to extend and streamline the internal market in
the last decade have ended in failure on takeover rules and a
single European patent, or been severely watered down on opening
up the cross-border market for services and energy.
 Left-wing, trade union and nationalist opposition to what
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has derided as ""the dogma of
unfettered competition"" was driven by a perception that it
undercut workers' rights and social protection.
 Fear of low-paid Polish plumbers taking French jobs was a
major factor in French voters' rejection of an EU constitution
in a 2005 referendum.
 Monti sees Europe today as gripped by ""market fatigue"" as
well as ""integration fatigue"", with public support for free
markets ebbing in western Europe due to unemployment and the
discrediting of financial capitalism in the credit crisis.
His recommendations risk being drowned out by the immediate
clamour to stabilise the euro and prevent Greece's debt crisis
from engulfing other countries in the single currency area.
 But Monti argues that the single currency and the single
market are two sides of the same coin. Greece's fiscal woes are
rooted in its failure to develop a competitive economy due to
domestic barriers to competition that protect vested interests
in the public and private sectors. Other countries suffer a
similar handicap, he argues, including his native Italy.
 In his quest for new political impetus, Monti recently urged
Poland, the largest of the new central European members, to make
relaunching the single market a key plank of its EU presidency
next year, and France to champion it in its drive for greater
economic governance when it chairs the G8 and G20 in 2011.

report on G20 call, changes byline)
 By Julien Toyer and Ilona Wissenbach
 BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - European Union finance
ministers on Sunday promised to counter the ""wolfpack"" of the
financial markets as they sought agreement on a 600 billion
euro ($805 billion) plan to keep Greece's debt crisis from
spreading.
 The compromise measure under discussion included loan
guarantees by euro zone countries worth 440 billion euros, a 60
billion euro stabilization fund and a 100 billion euro top-up
of International Monetary Fund loans, EU sources said.
 Financial markets have been punishing heavily indebted euro
zone members, threatening to plunge them into Greece's plight.
The safety net being assembled was meant to protect other
countries with bloated budgets, such as Portugal, Spain and
Ireland.
 Jitters over euro zone finances have set global markets on
edge, and provided a backdrop for a nearly 1,000-point drop in
the Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday, whose trigger
remains a mystery.
 Hopes the EU package would successfully tackle the crisis
helped lift the euro, which gained almost 2 percent against the
U.S. dollar and 3 percent on the yen in early Asia trade. U.S.
stock futures also surged at the start of trade on Sunday.
 Moving swiftly to bolster Greece and instill some
confidence in shaky markets, the IMF approved a 30 billion euro
rescue loan as part of a broader combined EU-IMF bailout for
the country totaling 110 billion euros. The IMF said 5.5
billion euros from the three-year loan would be disbursed
immediately.
 To secure the funds, Greece has committed to budget-cutting
measures so sharp that they have already caused violent
protests.
 ""Today's strong action by the IMF to support Greece will
contribute to the broad international effort underway to help
bring stability to the euro area and secure recovery in the
global economy,"" IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said in a statement.
 'WOLFPACK BEHAVIORS'
 But whether the coordinated international actions would
settle global markets, which have been roiled in recent days,
remained to be seen. Policymakers around the globe have become
worried about the knock-on effects should the crisis spread.
 ""We now see ... wolfpack behaviors, and if we will not stop
these packs, even if it is self-inflicted weakness, they will
tear the weaker countries apart,"" Swedish Finance Minister
Anders Borg told reporters in Brussels as he arrived for the EU
meeting.
 Britain's finance minister Alistair Darling stressed the
need to stabilize markets, while ministers from France, Spain,
Finland and other euro zone states vowed to defend their shared
currency.
 U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel spoke by phone earlier on Sunday about the importance of
EU members acting to build confidence in markets.
 Economists estimate that if Portugal, Ireland and Spain --
three other heavily indebted euro zone countries -- eventually
come to require bailouts similar to Greece's, the total cost
could be some 500 billion euros.
 As details of the financial barriers that the EU was
putting up to ward off speculators against Greece and other
debt-laden countries became public, G20 finance officials held
a teleconference to discuss the crisis.
 Last week, fears that a euro zone debt crisis could rock
banks and the global economy like the September 2008 collapse
of U.S. bank Lehman Brothers swept through markets, pushing
global stocks to near a three-month low. It was unclear whether
the EU crisis package would stem the tide.
 ""All in all this is good news, but it is unlikely in itself
to calm markets; it's all too 'slow-burner' stuff,"" said Erik
Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. He said he
expected the European Central Bank would soon need to take some
type of emergency action.
 EU sources said ECB governors met to discuss the crisis,
but no details were available.
 MARKET TURMOIL
 The 16 nations that use the single currency have been
criticized for contributing to market uncertainty by responding
too slowly to the crisis in Greece.
 An IMF board source told Reuters that some board members
had shared those concerns and raised worries that the crisis
could spread to other euro zone countries.
 A euro zone summit last week asked for a European
stabilization mechanism.
 Some economists said the move was welcome, but that it
would cure the symptoms, rather than the disease.
 ""By putting in place additional safeguards for the euro
area financial system, governments finally appear to be rising
to the challenge of the sovereign debt crisis,"" Morgan Stanley
said in a research note to clients.
 ""But, like the measures taken before -- for the benefit of
Greece -- a stabilization fund is just buying time for
distressed borrowers,"" it said.

 * Britain has no recent experience of coalition-building
 * Solid Lib-Con coalition clear preference over minority
(Updates with talks end for Sunday, meeting again Monday)
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Markets will open on Monday
without clarity on who will govern Britain, with a workable
coalition rather than unstable minority rule needed to pacify
investors jittery over the euro zone's Greek debt crisis.
 Sterling, gilts and stocks all sold off on Friday after the
opposition Conservatives failed to win an outright majority in
Thursday's elections, leaving Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown
defeated but still in power and third-party Liberal Democrats as
kingmakers.
 The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats held talks over the
weekend to try to put together a government, but while delegates
said progress had been made they failed to reach an outright
agreement but will meet again on Monday.
 Both Conservative leader David Cameron and Lib Dem leader
Nick Clegg face an uphill task selling any deal to their
respective parties. Investors wanting swift action on Britain's
record deficit are unlikely to be particularly patient.
 ""I think the markets will give them a nudge on Monday and
then a much larger nudge on Tuesday,"" said David Lea, Western
Europe analyst at consultancy Control Risks. ""It really has to
be sorted out by Monday night.""
 Asian markets will be the first to digest the weekend news,
while London markets could be buffeted by new statements and
appearances by party officials on early morning television and
radio.
 ""Market reaction on Monday ... will depend in significant
part on what the parties are saying publicly,"" said Alistair
Newton, political analyst and managing director at Nomura.
 If both parties were sending positive messages suggesting
they had a basic agreement on the principles of a coalition but
needed time to cement details, markets could react positively. 
 But negativity, conflict and intransigence could alarm
markets wanting a strong government to begin tackling Britain's
record deficit. Some analysts took heart from Conservative and
Lib Dem statements saying there was common ground on the economy
and deficit reduction.
 ""I don't think the market was expecting a deal by (Monday)
opening,"" said Eurasia Group analyst Wolfango Piccoli. ""The
politicians are being very positive and responsible. By talking
about the deficit, they are sending the right signal.""
 Denied a decisive election outcome, most analysts say the
most stable outcome would be a Lib-Con coalition rather than a
looser arrangement with the Lib Dems providing parliamentary
support from outside the government.
 Nevertheless, some analysts said the most likely outcome was
the latter, with the Lib Dems agreeing not to vote down key
policies, particularly the budget, but with differences over
electoral reform -- a key Lib Dem goal largely opposed by the
Conservatives -- preventing a coalition.
 Such negotiations are common in European politics but
Britain has not seen a hung parliament since 1974.
 
 UNSTABLE MINORITY?
 Analysts say the average length of time to form a European
coalition is 40 days, but with markets already nervous over
sovereign debt worries given the crisis in Greece and other
southern euro economies few believe Britain has such a luxury.
 The new government is due to set out its legislative
programme in the Queen's Speech to parliament on May 25.
Investors and credit ratings agencies will watch closely.
 ""The UK's relatively high debt ratios and large deficits
could result in the UK becoming a bad-weather version of Club
Med debt markets,"" said ING in a research note on Friday, using
a standard shorthand for the troubled economies of Italy,
Greece, Portugal and Spain and underlining that Britain might be
next in the firing line.
 Conservative leader David Cameron could try to push ahead as
a minority government with the support of a handful of Ulster
Unionists, and the Lib Dems agreeing to protect him against a
no-confidence vote to allow a budget through.
 But markets fear this option would prove inherently unstable
and might simply be too weak to tackle public spending,
potentially endangering Britain's AAA credit rating.
 ""I think investors would react negatively to a minority
government given the risk that a no-confidence vote could emerge
in parliament before year-end,"" said Simon Derrick, head of
currency strategy at Bank of New York Mellon.
 Some analysts, however, argue no party would risk forcing a
no-confidence vote for fear of being punished by the electorate
for a market crash.
 The sheer uncertainty makes markets favour a broader
coalition.
 If the Lib Dems and Conservatives proved unable to form a
coalition, one could potentially be put together by the Lib
Dems, Labour and multiple other smaller parties including
Scottish and Welsh nationalists.
 Brown and Clegg met on Sunday, a potential sign that the Lib
Dems were keeping their options open.
 But any Lib-Lab-Others coalition would barely have a
majority and investors would likely be lukewarm at best.

EU finance ministers on Sunday to extend an aid mechanism for

to safeguard euro zone financial stability, EU sources said.
 The Commission will also ask the extraordinary meeting of

 The maximum available now is 50 billion euros.
 EU sources said the 60 billion top-up would be used as base

would allow the Commission to raise up to 10 times that amount.
 The 60 billion top-up would be guaranteed by all 27 members
of the European Union and the loans, if paid out to an EU

Fund, one EU source said.
 As an additional measure for euro zone countries only, the
Commission will propose a separate mechanism of
intergovernmental loans, the source said.

 * Says very concerned about Greek debt crisis
(Updates with background on Russian position on dollar)
 By Ross Colvin and David Lawder
 WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said
if the United States has a strong economy it will have a strong
dollar, in rare comments about the U.S. currency in an
interview with Russian television broadcast on Saturday.
 Obama also expressed fresh American concern over the debt
turmoil roiling Greece, which has affected world markets.
 The interviewer from Russian television's state-run Channel
Rossiya asked Obama whether he would like to see a weaker or a
stronger dollar.
 ""My basic principle is to focus on the fundamentals of the
economy. I think that if we have a strong U.S. economy we're
going to have a strong dollar,"" Obama said, according to an
English-language transcript of the May 6 interview provided by
the White House.
 Obama's remarks were unusual as he normally leaves it to
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to take the lead role in
commenting on the U.S. currency.
 Geithner has typically repeated his long-standing mantra
that a strong dollar is in the U.S. interest and its value
would reflect the strength of the U.S. economy.
 Some foreign investors, including China, expressed concern
about dollar weakness late last year. Russia joined China in
calling for discussion of the possibility of creating a new
international reserve currency.
 ""GREECE TAKING DIFFICULT MEASURES""
 Obama's comments about the dollar would have been of keen
interest to his Russian audience given that many Russians,
including the government, have their savings in dollars.
 In the midst of the global economic crisis last year,
Russian leaders called for less global dependence on the dollar
and took steps to reduce the dollar's share of Russia's foreign
exchange reserve holdings, the world's third largest.
 But the dollar has grown stronger as worries about the
Greek debt crisis have driven investors out of the euro.
The dollar strengthened to around $1.27 per euro last week
from over $1.50 last December, when evidence of a U.S. recovery
was less clear and there were growing concerns the U.S. budget
deficit would continue to rise.
 Obama, who receives regular briefings from top economic
advisers about Greece's debt turmoil, said he was ""very
concerned"" about the crisis.
 ""But I think it is an issue that the Europeans recognize is
very serious,"" he added.
 ""Greece is taking some very difficult measures -- at least
they've put forward a plan that calls for difficult measures.
And if we can stabilize Europe that will be good for the United
States and that will be good for Russia as well.""
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has agreed to
implement austerity measures in exchange for billions of euros
in EU/IMF aid, but many Greeks have reacted angrily, with tens
of thousands taking to the streets to protest against the
planned cuts in wages and pensions.

 (Updates throughout with end of meeting, GCC head quote)
 By Souhail Karam
 RIYADH, May 8 (Reuters) - Gulf Arab countries are expected
to abolish a 5 percent steel import duty within one to two
months to ease a supply strain mostly felt in Saudi Arabia, an
official from a regional Gulf bloc said on Saturday.
 Finance ministers from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) examined the proposed measure at a meeting on
Saturday. A final decision is expected at a summit next week.
 ""There is consensus among GCC countries about this proposal.
It will be approved without any problem but it will probably
take a month or two for it to be implemented,"" an official from
the GCC secretariat told Reuters before the meeting.
 Saudi Arabia and five other Gulf Arab countries including
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have formed a GCC
customs union which imposes a common external tariff for
products imported from outside their bloc.
 GCC's Secretary General Abdulrahamn al-Attiyah said the
finance ministers agreed to the custom duty abolition -- which
would also extend to cement imports -- but did not set a
timeframe for its implementation.
 ""This issue was discussed extensively and there is consensus
among all ministers on the priority of ... working towards
achieving all the requested abolitions,"" Attiyah said.
 After a relative lull, steel demand began soaring in the
second half of 2009 in Saudi Arabia, fuelled mainly by massive
state spending by the world's top oil exporter on infrastructure
to diversify the economy and counter the effects of the global
economic downturn.
 The finance ministers also discussed proposals from Qatar to
set up a regional bank for international aid and a Bahraini
proposal to set up a stabilisation fund to aid troubled GCC
economies should the need arise.
 The meeting will set the agenda for the GCC summit in Riyadh
next week.
 ""There is no consensus over these two proposals. The
monetary union council should decide whether there is a need for
a stabilisation fund,"" the official said.
 ""As for the Qatari proposal, there are some voices within
GCC that question the need for a new aid institution.""
 Saudi Arabia is home to the Islamic Development Bank while
Kuwait hosts the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development.

 * Euro zone leaders formally approved Greek loans Friday
 * G7 discusses Greek situation, Obama talks to Merkel

(Adds Finnish/Austrian comment, Obama, Portugal, Greek polls)
 By Julien Toyer and Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 8 (Reuters) - European Union officials were
working out the details of a financial support mechanism on
Saturday to prevent Greece's debt turmoil spreading to Portugal
and Spain, ready for approval by EU finance ministers on Sunday.
 The leaders of the 16 countries that use the single currency
said on Friday after talks with the European Central Bank and
the executive European Commission that they would take whatever
steps were needed to protect the stability of the euro area.
 Both Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy cancelled trips to Moscow to mark the
anniversary of the end of World War Two in order to continue
consultations over the crisis, though German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said she would still go.
 President Barack Obama said he was ""very concerned"" about
Greece's debt turmoil and stressed that stabilising the country
was vital for both Europe's and the United States' economic
wellbeing.
 Financial markets have been pounding euro zone countries
with high deficits or debts as well as low economic growth,
threatening to force Portugal, Spain and Ireland into a position
where, like Greece, they would need to seek financial aid.
 A Portuguese government source said Lisbon had promised its
European Union counterparts to cut the country's budget deficit
further than planned this year, to 7.3 percent of GDP instead of
8.3 percent, by suspending some public works including a new
international airport for the capital..
 The euro zone leaders, who have been accused of heightening
market uncertainty with a lack of action, agreed to accelerate
budget cuts and ensure deficit targets are met this year.
 But they also decided, under pressure from the markets, to
ask all 27 EU countries to agree a financial mechanism to
ring-fence the Greek crisis before markets open on Monday.
 
 ""WORST CRISIS""
 ""The euro zone is going through the worst crisis since its
creation,"" Sarkozy said after Friday's euro zone summit in
Brussels.
 ""The leaders have decided to put in place a European
intervention mechanism to preserve the stability of the euro
zone. The decisions taken will have immediate application, from
the point that financial markets open on Monday morning.""
 Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said on Saturday: ""If
the domino effect begins, no economy is safe.""
 Fears that a euro zone debt crisis could rock banks and the
global economy like the Sept. 2008 collapse of U.S. bank Lehman
Brothers have swept through markets this week, pushing global
stocks to around a three-month low.
 If the new EU mechanism did not stabilise the markets, ""we
may be in a situation where one recession is followed by
another"", Vanhanen said.
 He said the contents of the new arrangement would emerge on
Sunday. ""Whether it contains already a sum of money, a fund,
that can be taken into use, or a mechanism, with which the
Commission or the Union can itself quickly take a loan, all this
will be resolved tomorrow.""
 Euro zone sources said late on Friday that the mechanism
could be funded by bonds issued by the European Commission with
guarantees from euro zone states.
 No details have been disclosed so far, but the sources said
EU law provided a legal basis for such a mechanism.
 The treaty governing the EU says that if a member of the
27-nation bloc is in difficulties caused by circumstances beyond
its control, EU ministers may grant it financial assistance.
 ""Two mechanisms have been agreed -- one based on article
122.2 of the Treaty saying the council can help a member state
with serious difficulties,"" one of the sources said.
 ""The other will enable the European Commission to go on the
markets and get money with an explicit guarantee of the member
states and an implicit guarantee of the ECB (European Central
Bank,"" the source added.
 A second source said: ""The details of this mechanism will be
agreed by Sunday and the idea is to trigger both on Sunday.""
 
 EMERGENCY LOANS
 Friday's EU summit approved $110 billion euros ($147
billion) in emergency EU/IMF loans to Greece over three years to
help it over a budget crisis in exchange for austerity measures
so sharp that they have already sparked violent protest.
 Two polls released on Saturday showed a majority of Greeks
support further strikes and demonstrations, though a third
showed only 28 percent backing. Three people were killed in a
petrol bomb attack in Athens during mass protests on Wednesday.
 Germany's highest court on Saturday rejected a request by
five academics to block the release of Germany's share of the
Greek rescue package, approved by parliament on Friday.
 Chancellor Merkel, who had initially resisted agreeing to
Greek aid due to strong public opposition at home, told voters
in a regional election taking place on Sunday that euro zone
countries would ""lead this fight for the stability of the euro
together and with resolve"".
 She said this did not only mean financial discipline.
 ""Those who created the excesses on the markets will be asked
to pay up -- those are in part the banks, those are the hedge
funds that must be regulated ... those are the short-sellers and
we agreed yesterday to implement this more quickly in Europe.""
 Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann told ORF radio that EU
treaty changes might be required -- an arduous process in the
27-nation bloc.
 ""The real fight against speculation won't happen in the next
48 hours,"" he said. ""To seriously fight speculation, we will
have to come up with much more than what we'll get in the next
couple of weeks.""

1476,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2010 08:52AM ET</span>",Gulf Arab customs union still faces snags," * Saudi-UAE differences may delay customs union
 * Customs receipt distibution a main point of contention
 
 By Souhail Karam
 RIYADH, May 8 (Reuters) - A disagreement over how the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) should distribute
custom receipts is threatening the completion of the bloc's
long-awaited customs union, officials said on Saturday.
 The GCC's attempts over the past 29 years to emulate the
European Union's economic integration model have been dogged by
delays in a monetary union plan and regional rivalry and
mistrust between its two biggest economies, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates.
 The introduction of a customs union in 2003 had been hailed
by officials as a major achievement countering critics claims
that the Gulf Arab bloc would be unable to realise economic
integration in the world's biggest oil exporting region.
 But differences remain and trucks transporting goods have
been held up for days mainly at the border between Saudi Arabia
and the UAE, an issue which has cast fresh doubts about the
efficiency of the customs union plan.
 GCC officials say the UAE is unhappy with a quota of
receipts proposed by the GCC secretariat but some stress that a
bigger issue would be to scrap red tape at border crossings.
 GCC Secretary General Abdulrahamn al-Attiyah cautioned at a
meeting of finance ministers of the bloc -- which also includes
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar -- against stopping in the midst
of ""transitional phase of the customs union.""
 ""The goal for everyone is to get to its final status (by the
start of 2011) and achieve greater and better economic benefits
than what has been achieved up to now.
 ""Extending the transitional phase may, God forbid, expose
the Gulf customs union ... to a retreat and to the loss of the
main gains for member states in the economic field as well as
weaken the credibility of their decisions for commercial
partners,"" he said at the meeting on Saturday.
 This task does not promise to be easy, the GCC officials
argue, given that most truck drivers in GCC are migrant workers
and the bloc has yet to create a more flexible and uniform
identification system for its massive non-native workforce.
 Kuwait's Finance Minister Mustapha al-Shamali, whose country
holds GCC's rotating presidency, said the issue of custom
receipts distribution was ""not a thorny issue impossible to
solve"" and that it had taken too long to be studied.
 ""Any formula or mechanism member states agree on has to be
reviewed after two years ... These customs receipts represent a
small fraction of member states' overall revenue so agreeing on
... their distribution should be easy,"" Shamali said.
 The meeting will set the agenda for a GCC summit in Riyadh
next week.

 * President has signed into law bill allowing aid to flow
 
 (Adds quote, background)
 BERLIN, May 8 (Reuters) - Germany's highest court said on
Saturday it had rejected a request from a group of academics to
block the immediate release of a German loan to Greece, allowing
the financial aid to flow to debt-stricken Athens.
 The five academics had argued that the financial aid -- part
of a euro zone/International Monetary Fund package -- was not
provided for under European Union treaties and would give rise
to inflationary policies.
 The constitutional court rejected their request to prevent
the immediate flow of loans to Greece, which asked for the aid
to cope with a debt crisis that has rocked financial markets and
brought the future of European integration into question.
 ""The complainants did not present concrete evidence that
their rights, in particular as regards article 14 (on property
rights) of the basic law (constitution), would be severely and
irreversibly affected as a result of the guaranteed loan,"" the
court said in a statement.
 A spokeswoman for the court said it had yet to decide on the
plaintiffs' parallel challenge to the legality of the aid but
that this would not happen any time soon -- meaning any ruling
would be probably be academic as Germany would likely have
already released the funds to Greece.
 Four of the academics had previously lost a challenge to the
introduction of the single currency in Europe.
 Germany's parliament on Friday approved a bill on Germany's
contribution to the multi-billion euro rescue package for
Greece, despite widespread public opposition to the measure, and
President Horst Koehler signed it into law.
 The law could see Germany lend 22.4 billion euros ($30
billion) to Greece over three years.
 Despite initial resistance to agreeing Greek aid due to
massive popular opposition to a bailout, German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said earlier this week the future of Europe
depended on approving the package.

 WASHINGTON/TORONTO, May 7 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven
rich countries is concerned about Greece's debt problems, a
Canadian official said on Friday, and hinted that there may be
other countries that will also need help.
 Canada is this year's chair of the G7.
 Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty would not discuss
the substance of talks between G7 finance ministers and central
bank governors early on Friday, but said his G7 partners were
watching developments closely.
 ""We are concerned. We're consulting closely with our
international partners.""
 In addition to Canada, the G7 includes Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
 Echoing comments from other G7 officials, Flaherty told
reporters that the G7 believed countries that are borrowing
heavily need to rein in fiscal deficits. But he questioned if
they could do that on their own.
 ""It's necessary that, first of all, that the countries
involved take the steps they need to take and be clear about
that, that they're going to take these steps toward fiscal
restraint, fiscal responsibility,"" he said.
 ""They will need some help, in all likelihood, in order to
manage the issue, as Greece did.""
 Leaders of euro zone countries on Friday approved a deal by
the European Union and International Monetary fund to provide
an aid package to Greece, EU sources said. The aid package of
110 billion euros ($147 billion) is to be released to Greece
over three years.
 The IMF board is to meet on Sunday to discuss its share of
the rescue deal.
 Greece has promised to slash spending in return, measures
which have provoked violent protests in Athens.
 U.S. President Barack Obama, in remarks at the White House
to highlight stronger-than-forecast U.S. April job growth, said
he had discussed developments in the Greek debt situation with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone.
 ""We agreed on the importance of a strong policy response by
the affected countries and a strong financial response from the
international community,"" Obama said.
 ""I made clear that the United States supports these efforts
and will continue to cooperate with European authorities and
the IMF during this critical period.""
 GEITHNER TALKS WITH G7, U.S. REGULATORS
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also participated
in the G7 call, but a Treasury spokesman had no immediate
comment on the outcome.
 A U.S. Treasury official earlier had described the call as
being ""focused on European leaders updating the G7 finance
ministers and central bank governors"" on Greece's debt woes.
 Geithner also held conference calls on Friday morning with
the heads of two U.S. market regulators, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, and with Federal Reserve officials.
 The SEC and CFTC are investigating Thursday's sudden stock
market plunge, which some market sources say may have been
caused by an errant trade by a large bank. An Obama
administration official said the Treasury Department was
closely monitoring the probe.
 The G7 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan and the United States. It has lost significance as the
world puts more stress on the broader Group of 20
industrialized and emerging economies, but retains a role in
issues like the European debt crisis.

 TORONTO, May 7 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar bounced back on
Friday from the three-month low it hit the day before, boosted
by an April jobs report that showed record gains and put more
pressure on the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates soon.
 Persistent fears of a market meltdown over Greece's debt
crisis kept the currency's rise in check, however.
 In a Reuters poll conducted after the employment figures
were released, all of Canada's primary securities dealers,
undaunted by Europe's fiscal crisis, said they expect the Bank
of Canada to start raising interest rates in June as the
economy roars ahead,. [ID:nN07180411]
 All 12 dealers said the central bank would push its key
interest rate 25 basis points higher from the current ultra-low
0.25 percent.
 Currencies usually strengthen as interest rates rise as
higher rates attract capital flows.
 ""It's going to take a fair bit more volatility I imagine in
global markets to dissuade the money markets here from the view
that the bank has to tighten rates at some point in the
not-too-distant future,"" said Shaun Osborne, chief currency
strategist at TD Securities.
 ""The economy appears to be firing very much on all
cylinders at the moment...we're still very bullish on the
medium-term outlook for the Canadian dollar and the specific
short-term outlook for the Canadian dollar on the crosses.""
 The currency  rose to a session high of C$1.0338 to
the U.S. dollar, or 96.73 U.S. cents, from about C$1.0448, or
95.71 U.S. cents, just before the jobs data's release.
 The euro also recovered from a 14-month low against the
U.S. dollar as German lawmakers approved a rescue package for
Greece while the greenback gained versus the yen after U.S.
data showed employment grew at its fastest pace in four years
in April. [FRX/]
 The Canadian currency finished the North American session
at C$1.0438 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.80 U.S. cents, up from
its close on Thursday of C$1.0523 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.03
U.S. cents.
 The currency was down 2.8 percent for the week, the
steepest weekly drop since October.
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the central bank's key policy rate, jumped on
Friday, showing the market believed credit tightening was more
likely after the data than before. 
 Last month, the Bank of Canada took a first step toward
tightening monetary policy by removing a commitment to keep
rates at the rock-bottom 0.25 percent until the end of June.
 Weighing on Canada's commodity-linked and risk-sensitive
currency was oil, which fell for a fourth day in a row,
tracking a steep fall in North American stock market indexes
due to euro zone worries. [O/R] [.N] [.TO]
 On Thursday, the Canadian dollar hit its lowest level since
early February and had its steepest intraday drop since the
market crash of 2008 on heightened fears that Greece's debt
crisis may spread to other euro zone countries and threaten the
economic recovery.
 As well, Thursday's mayhem across all markets led to
speculation about a massive errant trade.
 ""(Parity with the U.S. dollar) has been put back for quite
a while, and this just goes to show how quickly these things
can change,"" said Carlos Leitao, chief economist at Laurentian
Bank of Canada in Montreal.
 ""I think until, and unless, there is some more encouraging
news coming out of Europe, there will be downward pressure on
the Canadian dollar and upward pressure on the U.S. dollar.""
 BOND PRICES WEAKER
 Canadian government bond prices slumped across the curve,
after the strong domestic jobs data hinted at a higher rate
environment.
 Bond prices typically fall when interest rates go up as
their low-yielding fixed payments seems less lucrative compared
with rising yields on other investments.
 The move down also tracked U.S. Treasures, which fell as
safe-haven demand for bonds cooled with some stability
returning to Wall Street.
 The two-year government bond  slipped 5 Canadian
cents to C$99.39 to yield 1.805 percent, while the 10-year bond
 dropped 15 Canadian cents to C$100.00 to yield
3.500 percent.

economy added 290,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in April, gave only
minimal support to risky assets. U.S. stocks traded lower and
oil prices shed more than 2 percent.
 Sterling hit a one-year low beneath $1.45 after elections
in Britain left no party with an outright parliamentary
majority. It rebounded when Conservative Party leader David
Cameron said he would try to form a minority government.
 Speculation the European Central Bank may support other
indebted euro zone countries and European banks helped the euro
off a 14-month low against the dollar and eased fears Greece's
debt woes may ripple through the region, traders said.
 Wall Street fell however, extending losses from Thursday
when the Dow at one point suffered its biggest ever intraday
point drop -- nearly 1,000 points.
 Although some of Thursday's precipitous fall was being
blamed on erroneous trades, concerns about the euro zone debt
woes persisted as investors feared further escalation in the
crisis would hit economic growth and market sentiment.
 ""The market was already under pressure because of the
growing recognition that the crisis in Greece has gone from
being a Greek problem to a regional problem and now it's
morphing into a global problem,"" Pacific Investment Management
Co (Pimco) Chief Executive and Co-chief Investment Officer
Mohamed El-Erian told Reuters Insider.
 The Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500
index posted their biggest weekly percentage declines since
March 2009. The Nasdaq Composite Index had the largest weekly
percentage fall since November 2008.
 On Friday the Dow <.DJI> was down 113.59 points, or 1.08
percent, at 10,406.73. The S&P 500 <.SPX> was off 13.39 points,
or 1.19 percent, at 1,114.76. The Nasdaq <.IXIC> was down 43.11
points, or 1.86 percent, at 2,276.53.
 ""It's amazing that you could say the jobs report may not be
the big mover on a Friday of a jobs report number. I think
we're watching overseas and what's going on in the equities
market,"" said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at
McQueen, Ball & Associates at Bethlehem in Pennsylvania.
 European shares ended at a 6-month closing low, suffering
their worst weekly fall since November 2008.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares closed down 3.9 percent at 967.42 after touching an
8-month intraday low, and ended the week down 8.9 percent.
 Banking stocks' earlier gains evaporated and they became
the worst performers. BNP Paribas , Barclays 
and Societe Generale  fell 5.5 to 7.8 percent. The
STOXX Europe 600 banking index <.SX7P> is down 16 percent so
far this year.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro last traded
0.4 percent higher at $1.2711  after falling to $1.2520
on Thursday, its lowest since March 2009.
 The euro lost more than 4 percent versus the dollar in the
week and it is down about 11 percent this year.
 Against the yen , the euro rose 1.2 percent to
115.96 after dipping below 111 yen Thursday -- its lowest level
since 2001.
 Sterling was little changed at $1.4757 , off a
one-year low of $1.4475 touched after the election results,
while the dollar rose 0.8 percent to 91.25 yen , but it
remained off a session peak above 93 yen touched earlier.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices fell Friday, taking back some of
the sharp gains made Thursday, with the 10-year Treasury note
 trading 9/32 lower in price and its yield rising to
3.43 percent.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures fell
 for a fourth day in a row and settled down $2, or 2.6
percent, at $75.11 a barrel, after falling further to $74.51,
its lowest since Feb. 16.
 Losses for the week totaled $11.04, or 12.8 percent, the
worst since prices fell almost 27 percent in the week to Dec.
19, 2008.

 NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Friday
from a 14-month low against the dollar as German lawmakers
approved a rescue package for Greece while the dollar gained
versus the yen after U.S. data showed employment grew at its
fastest pace in four years.
 Sterling hit a one-year low below $1.45 after the UK
election left no party with an outright parliamentary majority
but rebounded when Conservative Party leader David Cameron said
he would try to form a minority government.
 Traders said speculation that the European Central Bank may
act to support other indebted euro zone countries and banks
also helped the euro rebound and eased fears that Greece's debt
woes may spread.
 The ECB declined to comment on the speculation.
 Nonetheless, the euro was still headed for its worst week
against the dollar since October 2008.
 ""We got positive news on the euro front as both houses of
Germany's parliament approved the 110 billion euro Greek
rescue,"" said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at
Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""But the problem remains, who
is going to bail out Spain or Portugal if it turns out they
need help?""
 Following parliamentary approval, German President Horst
Koehler signed into law a bill authorizing the country's
contribution to a multibillion-euro rescue package for Greece,
his office said.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro last traded
0.4 percent higher at $1.2711 after falling to $1.2520 on
Thursday, its lowest since March 2009.
 The euro lost more than 4 percent versus the dollar in the
week and it is down about 11 percent this year.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 1.2 percent to 115.96 after
dipping below 111 yen Thursday, its lowest since 2001.
 Sterling was little changed at $1.4757, off a one-year low
of $1.4475 touched after the election results. 
 U.S. ADDS JOBS
 A surprisingly large addition of 290,000 U.S. jobs in April
boosted the dollar against the yen and helped currencies
retrace some of their massive moves on Thursday when European
debt worries were compounded by a huge intraday stock slide
that was partly due to a trading error.
 The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 91.25 yen, but it remained
off a session peak above 93 yen touched earlier.
 ""It reinforces the view that the U.S. is in a V-shaped
recovery and means the Fed will likely hike rates sooner than
central banks in Japan and Europe,"" Salvaggio said.
 But events in Europe overshadowed the U.S. jobs data.
 ""Traders' main concern is the sovereign debt issue, even
though signs the U.S. economy is picking up do make people see
the dollar as a comparatively healthy currency at the moment,""
said Sebastien Galy, strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 ""The U.S. yield curve should have steepened much more and
the dollar should have gotten a bigger boost against the yen on
such strong jobs data, so we're not out of the woods.""
 Galy said traders still fear that debt problems in other
euro zone countries, such as Spain and Portugal, may cause
losses at European banks, leading to a general crisis of
liquidity and confidence.
 BNP Paribas this week predicted the euro would hit parity
against the dollar in early 2011.
 Salvaggio said that is why markets have latched onto hopes
that the ECB could act to help banks, perhaps via currency swap
lines or low-interest loans.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said Thursday that
officials had not discussed buying euro zone government debt.
Meanwhile, ECB Governing Council member Guy Quaden told a
Belgian newspaper the euro zone is not about to break apart and
market attacks on the likes of Spain and Portugal are purely
speculative.
 Finance officials from the Group of Seven nations convened
a conference call Friday to discuss the Greek situation,
although Japan's finance minister said he did not think they
were considering joint currency intervention.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2010 03:16PM ET</span>",FX OUTLOOK-Euro to extend declines on sovereign debt fear," By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - The euro is poised to remain
under significant pressure in the near term after posting its
worst weekly performance against the dollar since 2008 as fears
persist over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
 The 16-nation currency tumbled to a 14-month low near $1.25
this week and is on track to post a weekly loss of 4.4 percent,
the biggest percentage drop since October 2008.
 Worries about the Greek debt crisis went global on
Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average suffering its
biggest-ever intraday point drop and the yen soaring as
investors reduced risky positions funded by cheap borrowing in
the Japanese currency.
 ""Markets are obviously very preoccupied with the issues in
Europe,"" said Aroop Chatterjee, currency strategist at Barclays
Capital in New York. ""Near term, the question is whether there
are any positive catalysts on the horizon for the euro? It's
hard to find these and so our view is that in the short term,
being euro bearish makes a lot of sense.""
 German lawmakers approved a rescue package for Greece on
Friday, while U.S. data showed employment grew last month at
the fastest pace in four years. But the news provided only a
modest dose of optimism in a market that is very nervous about
contagion risks in Europe.
 In a volatile session, the euro  was last at $1.2742,
up 0.7 percent, partly helped by speculation the European
Central Bank may act to support other indebted euro zone
countries and banks. The ECB declined to comment.
 Since the beginning of the year, the euro zone's single
currency has fallen more than 11 percent versus the greenback.
 James Chen, chief technical strategist at FX Solutions,
noted that despite a modest rebound on Friday, the euro broke
below a support trendline extending from the October 2008 low
on Thursday and ""the strong bearishness"" is likely not yet
over.
 ""Within the context of the strong and continuing downtrend
in euro/dollar, any subsequent breakdown below $1.2500 could
target further key downside support around the $1.2300 price
region,"" he said.
 Barclays Capital revised down its one-month and three-month
targets for euro/dollar to $1.20.
 BNP Paribas, on the other hand, said this week that the
euro will fall to parity against the U.S. dollar by the first
quarter of 2011. See [ID:nN06112963]
 DATA TO TAKE BACK SEAT
 Currency investors will also closely monitor euro zone
government bond spreads and dollar and euro funding pressures
in the inter-bank market next week, analysts said.
 Fears have risen that Greece's debt problems may reignite
the distrust that froze money markets in the early stages of
the financial crisis.
 ""There are a lot of remaining risk scenarios ahead, so we
do believe that will continue to pressure the euro into next
week and in the medium term,"" said Amelia Bourdeau, senior
currency strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The U.S. economic calendar is the coming week is relatively
light and will take a back seat to developments in the euro
zone. The highlight will come on Friday when retail sales,
industrial production and capacity utilization, and consumer
sentiment data are released.
 Also next week, the Bank of England is all but certain to
leave interest rates at 0.5 percent and not to undertake any
further quantitative easing purchases when it concludes its
Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Monday. [ID:nLDE6461UP]
 Sterling  hit a one-year low below $1.45 after the UK
election left no party with an outright parliamentary majority
but rebounded when Conservative Party leader David Cameron said
he would try to form a minority government.
 Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon
in New York, said while the debt crisis in Europe will continue
to dictate sentiment ""with the overwhelming likelihood that
matters will be getting far worse before they get any better,""
the silver lining is that the global economy ex-Europe
continues to recover.
 ""The current bout of risk aversion will provide excellent
opportunities to establish better levels in high-yielding
assets across the board, from equities to commodities to
foreign exchange,"" he said.

 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, May 7 (Reuters) - A record number of Canadians
returned to work in April, stunning markets and adding pressure
on the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates in June, ahead of
other major industrialized countries.
 Job gains soared past all forecasts to total 108,700 in the
month, the highest number since Statscan began tracking the
data in 1976, and exceeding even the most optimistic estimate
in a Reuters poll, which yielded a median forecast of 25,000
new jobs. The percentage increase, at 0.6 percent, was the
largest since August 2002.
 The data showed private business, not government, did the
hiring for a second straight month.
 The Canadian dollar  shot up to a high of C$1.0338
to the U.S. dollar, or 96.73 U.S. cents, compared with its
close on Thursday of C$1.0523 to the U.S. dollar.
 ""I think this is fantastic news ... It's just another sign
that the Canadian economy is doing better than anyone could
have hoped at the start of the year,"" said Steve Butler,
director of foreign exchange trading at Scotia Capital.
 The report reminded investors of Canada's upbeat recovery
after days of market gyrations over the Greek debt crisis and
fears it could spread to other euro zone countries.
 ""If anybody was in doubt that interest rates were going
higher and that they need to be normalized, I think that doubt
is no longer with us ... this is consistent with a rising-rate
environment, and that process is going to begin soon,"" said
Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
 JUNE RATE HIKE SEEN
 The central bank took a first step last month toward
tightening monetary policy by removing a commitment to keep
rates at a rock-bottom 0.25 percent until the end of June.
 In a Reuters poll on Friday after the jobs report, Canada's
12 primary securities dealers unanimously predicted the bank
will lift rates to 0.50 percent on June. 1. In the previous
poll on April 20, 11 had forecast a first move in June.
 But some said they would put a ""massive asterisk"" beside
their forecasts given European debt woes and recent volatility
on financial markets.
 That uncertainty has led to rapidly changing expectations
for monetary policy, as reflected in yields on overnight index
swaps . Just before the jobs data Friday, rate
futures priced in only a 39.7 percent probability of a June
rate hike but that jumped to 65.4 percent by Friday afternoon.
 ""Just as the rolling European crisis looked like it could
ice the Bank of Canada for a spell, the domestic economy has
served a rather loud warning that it needs tending as well,""
said Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital
Markets.
 The economy grew at a sizzling 5 percent annualized rate in
the fourth quarter and is expected to match that pace in the
first quarter of 2010.
 But even in fiscally solid Canada, the shaky outlook for
Europe has people on edge and Bank of Canada Governor Mark
Carney's next move is not at all obvious.
 ""On the one hand, if the economy is relatively strong, he
might want to go. On the other hand, we have big strong clouds
in Europe which could be a force in the opposition direction.
So that is a decision for Mark Carney,"" said John McCallum, a
liberal legislator and a former bank economist.
 Since the labor market began recovering last July, 285,000
workers have been added to payrolls -- still short of the
417,000 jobs lost between October 2008 and July 2009.
 The services sector continued to generate more employment
than the goods-producing category in April, led by wholesale
and retail trade as well as business, building and other
support services. Hiring in the goods sector was weakened by
the loss of 20,600 factory workers.
 Employment growth was up in both full-time and part-time
work and concentrated among men between ages 25 and 54,
Statscan said.
 The average wage of permanent employees, watched by the
Bank of Canada for inflation pressures, rose 2.3 percent in
April from a year earlier, down from 2.5 percent in March.

 * Election result produces maximum uncertainty
 * Tone of political statements could be key to sentiment
 * PM Brown's positions seen all but untenable
 * Key issue is who runs Britain when markets open Monday
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Britain's election looks to have
produced the most inconclusive result possible -- a narrow
victory for the right leaning Conservatives and a Labour Prime
Minister who shows no inclination to step aside yet.
 Financial markets want negotiations on forming a new
government to be over quickly and clarity on who will be in
charge. They also need to know whether that leader will head a
minority government or a coalition.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown soldiers on, but for how long?
 The pound, gilts and stock market all fell initially on
Friday when it became clear that the Conservatives had failed to
secure a parliamentary majority. 
 Markets want clarity fast, followed by swift action on
tackling Britain's record budget deficit.
 That much was clear from a bounce after Britain's third
party, the Liberal Democrats, indicated it was open to the idea
of a Conservative government -- followed by further rises and
falls as other party leaders spoke later.
 What investors fear most is policy paralysis at a time when
markets around the globe are already volatile due to worries
that a debt crisis in Greece may spread across Europe and
beyond.
 ""The (UK) market reaction has been relatively muted so far,
but they will lose patience,"" said Nomura political analyst
Alastair Newton. ""The key thing is where everything stands when
Tokyo markets open on Monday. Sovereign debt markets in
particular are extremely nervous over Greece.""
 Some of the sharpest moves so far have been in the gilts
market, potentially increasing Britain's borrowing costs and
pushing the difference in British and German bond yields to its
highest level in 12 years. 
 In the run-up to the election, gilts had proved more
resilient to political worries with election-driven market moves
largely limited to sterling. 
 The pound hit a one-year low against the dollar on Friday
and a two-week low against the troubled euro before recovering.
 A moderately falling pound does little to damage Britain's
economy directly, beyond slightly boosting imported inflation,
and indeed improves its competitiveness abroad. But a spike in
gilts yields would be unwelcome.
 Brown constitutionally has the first opportunity to form a
government and is reaching out to the centrist Lib Dems with the
offer of a referendum on electoral reform, long desired by
Britain's smaller political parties. 
 
 WORKING TOGETHER?
 The Conservative line is that Labour has lost its mandate to
govern. Leader David Cameron said he was examining both options
of trying to rule as a minority and in coalition with the Lib
Dems -- although his offer on electoral reform was only to set
up a commission to look into it.
 Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's line so far has been that the
Conservatives should have the first chance to form a government,
as they won the most votes and seats in parliament. But he is
walking an uneasy line, reluctant to rule anything out before
negotiations that could beyond the weekend.
 The most stable coalition in terms of parliamentary seats
would involve the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, although
they are not natural allies. The Lib Dems are pro-European
Union, unlike the eurosceptic Conservatives, and like Labour
they want to delay cutting the deficit until next year.
 On tax policy, the Lib Dems want a much more redistributive
system reducing the burden on the poorest and increasing that on
the rich. This could make agreement on an ""austerity budget""
more difficult. 
 ""I think Cameron and Clegg could work together, but I think
Clegg would find that difficult to sell to his party,"" said
Nomura's Newton.
 A meeting of Liberal Democrats on Saturday could prove
important in determining whom they support. In the meantime,
markets will be watching politicians' statements for any signs
that agreement could be reached.
 
 TAKING AGGRESSIVE TONE?
 Frontbench politicians from the two main parties faced off
robustly against each other in morning television sessions,
worrying markets, before the three party leaders struck a more
conciliatory, statesmanlike note later in the day.
 ""If you see senior figures... taking a very aggressive tone
and not conceding to each other I think people may think it will
take a lot longer to form a government, and you could see a much
more negative (market) reaction,"" said Wolfango Piccoli, an
analyst at Eurasia Group.
 Analysts expect much noise over the weekend as the parties
secretly negotiate, but said the key decision-makers would play
their cards close to their chests.
 The chief issue for investors -- and credit ratings agencies
which have already warned Britain could risk losing its AAA
status -- is addressing the deficit. That makes passage of any
emergency budget particularly important, not to mention the
initial market reaction to it.
 Market analysts have been saying that a broad coalition
might prove more capable of fiscal tightening than a minority
government. But the election result leaves parliament so finely
balanced that putting this together looks relatively difficult.
 ""Fiscal tightening on the scale needed to get back to fiscal
sustainability may well not be politically sustainable in a
minority government,"" said Citi in a research note.
 But Jefferies chief economist David Owen said he believed
the Conservatives could push through a budget either as a
minority government or in coalition with the Lib Dems.
 ""I don't think this result is a disaster for Britain,"" said
Owen. ""It's just a matter of getting through the next few days

* UK election results point to no single party majority
 * But hopes of Conservative/Lib Dem deal lift pound
 
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Sterling slid against the dollar
and the euro on Friday in choppy trade as a bitterly fought UK
election left no one party in overall control, but then
recovered as leaders pledged to try to form a government.
 The result left the opposition Conservative Party with the
most seats but without overall control, leaving unclear the
composition of the next government and how it would tackle the
UK's ballooning budget deficit.
 Early in the day the pound tumbled to a one-year low below
$1.45 and lost more than 2 percent against the euro, before
rebounding as the Conservatives and the smaller Liberal
Democrats looked poised for talks on forming a government.
 Conservative leader David Cameron said he was prepared to
explore the possibility of running a minority government and
that he would make a coalition offer to the Liberal Democrats.

 The Lib Dems' leader, Nick Clegg, earlier said the
ConserVatives had the mandate to form a government
 Reassurances from rating agencies that the inconclusive
election outcome posed no immediate threat to the UK's top-notch
triple-A credit rating also provided some relief for sterling,
but worries about how the UK would tackle its debt problems
remained.
 ""The uncertainty about what shape the new government will
take is lending a more hesitant tone to sterling,"" said Brown
Brothers Harriman currency strategist Audrey Childe-Freeman.
 ""The comments from Clegg and then Cameron gave sterling some
relief, but this was not sustained as questions remain over
whether the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats can work
together"".
 By 1622 GMT, sterling traded 0.2 percent higher against the
dollar at $1.4789, comfortably above an earlier low of $1.4475,
its weakest since late April 2009.
 Sterling's losses on Friday followed a hefty tumble on
Thursday due to election jitters and put the pound on track to
post a loss of nearly 4 percent versus the dollar for the week,
its worst weekly performance since January 2009.
 The euro rose 0.5 percent against the pound to 86.16 pence.
The single currency earlier jumped more than 2 percent to a
two-week high 88.10 pence.
 This helped push the pound to a one-month low of 78.3 on a
trade-weighted basis, a steep loss from the near three-month
high of 80.4 touched on Thursday. By the 1500 GMT fixing, it had
recovered to 78.8.
 
 PRESSURE PERSISTS
 UK assets were stung by the inconclusive election results,
with British shares falling, while UK government bonds
underperformed their German counterparts.
 Analysts say any relief at a coalition being formed may be
short-lived as concerns remain that the sovereign credit rating
could still be cut if the government fails to take decisive
action to combat the deficit.
 ""There are still a lot of uncertainties and the longer it
takes to form a credible, stable coalition the more it will be a
headwind for sterling,"" said Ned Rumpeltin, currency strategist
at Nomura.
 Sterling may also be vulnerable to growing investor aversion
to risk due to fears that the euro zone debt crisis may spread.
 ""The UK faces a difficult mix of political weakness and
unsustainable fiscal trends,"" Citigroup analysts said in a note
to clients.

 By Sumeet Desai and David Lawder
(Updates with comments from Obama, Canada to hold news
conference)
 LONDON/WASHINGTON, May 7 (Reuters) - Finance ministers from
the Group of Seven rich nations club agreed on Friday to
closely watch turmoil in financial markets caused by the Greek
debt crisis while U.S. President Barack Obama urged a strong
financial response from Europe to deal with the crisis.
 The ministers and central bank governors from the United
States, Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Italy and Germany held
a conference call to discuss the efforts to funnel aid to
debt-stricken Greece earlier on Friday.
 ""The conference call covered the ongoing volatility in
international financial markets. Ministers agreed to continue
to monitor the situation closely,"" the official said.
 Alistair Darling, still Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer or finance minister as no clear result has yet come
out of Thursday's election, represented Britain on the call.
 ""The Chancellor underlined that it is in everyone's
interest to maintain financial stability,"" the official said.
 Obama, in remarks at the White House to highlight
stronger-than-forecast U.S. April job growth data, said he had
discussed developments in the Greek debt situation with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone.
 ""We agreed on the importance of a strong policy response by
the affected countries and a strong financial response from the
international community,"" Obama said. ""I made clear that the
United States supports these efforts and will continue to
cooperate with European authorities and the IMF during this
critical period.""
 Euro-zone leaders at a summit in Brussels are expected to
give their approval to a European Union-International Monetary
Fund deal to provide 110 billion euros ($140 billion) in aid to
Greece to help it though its debt crisis.
 In exchange, Greece has promised to adopt austerity
measures such as cuts in pensions and public spending -- moves
that have provoked violent protests in Athens.
 Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty was expected to hold
a news conference later on Friday. Although a government
spokesman did not discuss the subject matter, Flaherty would
have been among those on the G7 conference call.
 GEITHNER TALKS WITH G7, U.S. REGULATORS
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also participated
in the G7 call, but a Treasury spokesman had no immediate
comment on the call's outcome.
 A U.S. Treasury official earlier had described the call as
being ""focused on European leaders updating the G7 finance
ministers and central bank governors"" on Greece's debt woes.
 Geithner also held conference calls on Friday morning with
the heads of two U.S. market regulators, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, and with Federal Reserve officials.
 The SEC and CFTC are investigating Thursday's sudden stock
market plunge, which some market sources say may have been
caused by an errant trade by a large bank. An Obama
administration official said the Treasury Department was
closely monitoring the probe.
 Japan's finance Minister Naoto Kan made no comments to
reporters following the G7 call, but Japan's Jiji news agency
quoted an unnamed finance ministry official as saying ministers
on the call had discussed the need to cooperate in dealing with
Greece's problems. The Jiji report did not elaborate.
 A German finance ministry spokesman also declined to
comment about the G7 call.

(Closes prices)
 ISTANBUL, May 7 (Reuters) - Turkish bonds and stocks slumped
and the lira hit its weakest level against the dollar in a year
after risk aversion swept through markets worldwide on fears
about Europe's mounting debt crisis.
 The lira  traded at 1.572 against the dollar at 1445
GMT from a close of 1.535 on Thursday. It hit 1.63 overnight in
electronic trade , according to bankers. The currency has
declined some 3 percent since the start of May.
 ""The pressure from abroad is that strong ... The lira's
losses are all from foreign markets,"" said a banker who did not
wish to be named.
 The ISE National 100 <.XU100> share index closed down 5.52
percent to 52,686.97 as investors sold riskier emerging market
assets, like Turkey's, as fears mounted over contagion of the
Greek debt crisis. Banks <.XBANK>, which account for about 40
percent of the index's weighting, fell 5.77 percent.
 Governments around the world sought to calm markets after
fears about Greece's debt crisis went global, with investors
seeing it as an omen of turmoil in other European economies.
 The yield on the benchmark Jan. 25, 2012 bond
<0#TRTSYSUM=IS> rose to 10.05 percent in over-the-counter trade
from a close of 9.73 percent on Thursday. It settled at 9.92
percent on Friday.
 Turkish bond yields have been climbing as investors digest
higher-than-expected inflation data released earlier this week.
 The data has added pressure on the central bank to bring
planned interest rate hikes forward. The bank said previously it
saw measured rate increases in the fourth quarter.
 Rates are currently at a record low of 6.5 percent after the
bank slashed them by 10.25 percentage points to stave off the
effects of the global economic crisis.
 The global market rout is likely to dampen any bounce from
parliament's approval overnight of a contentious bill from the
ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party to reform the constitution.
 Also, the issue is far from settled, analysts said, because
the secularist opposition has now pledged to block a referendum
on the changes, which could increase political risk.
 ""The referendum is not a certainty and the key issue to
watch is the main opposition's appeal to the Constitutional
Court for cancellation of the changes,"" wrote analysts at
Finansbank in a note.
 ""Given the court's track record, there is a significant
chance that it will cancel the changes and halt the referendum
process, which would raise the risk of early elections.""
 The secular-minded Constitutional Court has struck down
several key AK reforms in the past.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen
on Friday after data showed U.S. employment grew last month at
its fastest pace in four years, but the euro kept struggling on
fear that Greece's debt woes could spread to other countries.
 Sterling hit a one-year low beneath $1.45 after the UK
election left no party with an outright parliamentary majority,
but it rebounded when Conservative Party leader David Cameron
said he would try to form a minority government. For details,
see [ID:nLAL004425].
 A surprisingly large addition of 290,000 U.S. jobs in April
boosted the dollar against the yen and helped currencies
retrace some of their massive moves on Thursday when European
debt worries were compounded by a huge intraday stock slide
that was partly due to a trading error.
 But while the jobs data bolstered confidence in a U.S.
economic recovery, it provided only a modest jolt of optimism
in a market that is very nervous about contagion risks in
Europe.
 ""Traders' main concern is the sovereign debt issue, even
though signs the U.S. economy is picking up do make people see
the dollar as a comparatively healthy currency at the moment,""
said Sebastien Galy, senior strategist at BNP Paribas in New
York.
 ""But the U.S. yield curve should have steepened much more
and the dollar should have gotten a bigger boost against the
yen on such strong jobs data, so we're not out of the woods.""
 While the dollar rose 0.6 percent to 91.08 yen , it
was well off a session peak above 93 yen. The euro gave up
earlier gains and was last down 0.3 percent at $1.2629 ,
about a cent above a 14-month low hit on Thursday.
 Germany's approval of a 110 billion euro rescue for Greece
on Friday did little to help euro sentiment. BNP's Galy said
traders still fear that debt woes in other euro zone countries,
such as Spain and Portugal, may cause losses at European banks,
causing a general crisis of liquidity and confidence. 
 The euro was down 5.2 percent this week, on pace for its
worst weekly slide since October 2008, and down nearly 12
percent this year. BNP Paribas this week predicted the euro
would hit parity against the dollar in early 2011.
 Sterling was down 0.6 percent at $1.4670 , off a
one-year low of $1.4475 touched after the election results. The
dollar recovered losses against the Canadian dollar seen after
Canada reported a record record 108,700 jobs in April .

 UNCERTAINTY, ANXIETY STILL PROMINENT
 Analysts said the yen remained an important barometer of
risk. As financial markets swooned on Thursday, the yen soared
against other currencies as investors unwound carry trades,
which use cheaply borrowed yen to finance purchases of other
currencies and assets.
 The dollar neared 88 yen Thursday for its biggest daily
fall since 1998, while the euro fell below 111 yen to its
lowest level since 2001 before rebounding 0.9 percent Friday to
to 115.64 yen .
 ""As long as people are worried about European turmoil, the
dollar will be capped at 93 or 94 yen,"" said Hidetoshi
Yanagihara, senior FX trader at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New
York.

a conference call Friday to discuss the Greek situation,
although Japan's finance minister said he did not think they
were considering joint currency intervention. [ID:nN06238681]

 Analysts said markets are still waiting for the European
Central Bank, perhaps in concert with other central banks, to
announce measures to boost liquidity, including dollar swap
lines used during the worst of the financial crisis.
 Investors speculated this week that the ECB could even buy
euro zone government debt to cut countries' borrowing costs,
but President Jean-Claude Trichet said that had not been
considered.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2010 11:04AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Euro slide good for EU wheat exports," * Euro slide may boost end of export campaign, ease stocks
 * Algeria tender, Mexico shipment raise French export hopes
 * German trade wants lower euro, Spain sees dollar headache
 * Russian exports, price correction may limit EU shipments
 
 By Gus Trompiz
 PARIS, May 7 (Reuters) - A tumbling euro could give European
wheat exports an extra lift in the final weeks of the 2009/10
campaign, enabling the region to clinch deals in both
traditional markets and rarer destinations like Latin America.
 The windfall may be limited by competition from Russia and
slower demand from North African buyers as local harvests get
underway, but should still put a better gloss on a season marked
by brimming stocks, analysts and traders said.
 Weakness in the euro, which touched 14-month lows against
the dollar this week on fears Greece's debt crisis will spread,
makes shipments from euro-zone exporters like France and Germany
cheaper in international grain markets that trade in dollar
prices.
 ""We have the euro-dollar rate that has slipped and the fact
the U.S. market is holding up. This makes us a lot more
competitive,"" one French trader said.
 French wheat was seen as best placed to enjoy an export run
and sentiment has been boosted by confirmation of a rare
shipment to Mexico and expectations of new business in a tender
from Algeria.
 A fall in the euro in March, coupled with a drop in
benchmark European prices, sparked an upturn in exports and led
to reports EU origins had won rare sales to Latin America.
 A subsequent market rally eroded this competitive edge,
putting in doubt Latin American sales booked as optional-origin,
but the new slide in the euro could reinvigorate French sales.
 ""Has this window of opportunity (to Latin America) reopened?
It's possible,"" said Emmanuel Jayet, analyst with Societe
Generale.
 Many in France expect the country's wheat exports outside
Europe this season to top the 9.2 million tonnes currently
forecast by farm office FranceAgriMer.
 ""The increase in competitiveness could allow us to exceed
this figure a bit,"" said Cedric Weber, analyst with grains
consultancy Offre & Demande Agricole.

 STOCKS STILL SUBSTANTIAL
 But for this spate of deals to snowball into an export
surge, the euro would have to keep falling and European prices
remain relatively attractive against rival origins.
 ""Most people seem to think a further drop in the euro to
around $1.20 is needed to create big new export business,"" a
German trader said.
 The euro fell below $1.27 on Thursday to a low since March
2009. It recouped some losses on Friday but remained fragile as
long as markets feared Greece's debt problems could spread,
operators said.
 Operators in Germany, the European Union's No. 2 grain
exporter, also stressed they were waiting for evidence of new
business to ease persistent pressure from large old-crop stocks.
European wheat also continued to face tough competition from
Russia, which had benefitted from a drop in the rouble against
the dollar, Societe Generale's Jayet added.
 ""There is a general wave of risk aversion, this is not just
affecting the euro against dollar.""
 In major importer Spain, meanwhile, a rising dollar risked
pushing up short-term costs for a grains sector that depends
partly on dollar-priced imports from outside the EU.
 ""The dollar at 1.27 is giving us a big headache,"" one dealer
said.
 The Spanish market, which has a structural shortfall in
wheat of least 7 million tonnes a year, was holding out for a
correction in world dollar-denominated commodity prices that
typically follows a rally in the U.S. currency, operators said.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2010 10:44AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Greek PM must bow to calls for catharsis," * Greek PM must tackle corruption to push austerity measures
 * Violent protests show public demands punishment
 * Reforms must run deep, change Greece
 
 By Dina Kyriakidou
 ATHENS, May 7 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands screamed
""Thieves, Thieves!"" outside Greece's parliament in violent
protests this week that killed three people -- and for the first
time, the prime minister was listening.
 After seven months in office, George Papandreou finally
appears to be heeding calls for retribution as he tries to push
through his pain-for-aid measures on a society enraged over
chronic corruption.
 ""My rage is huge when I see the tragedy of the looting of
Greek people's wealth,"" he told a parliament debate on his
austerity bill on Thursday, accusing the previous government of
waste and corruption.
 ""One minister paid 28,000 euros for office curtains...They
will be prosecuted.""
 Opinion polls show Greeks are more willing to suffer
belt-tightening measures to exit a debt crisis shaking the euro
zone if those they hold responsible for their woes -- corrupt
politicians and businessmen -- pay.
 Analysts say tackling high level corruption means changing a
legal system set up to protect parliamentarians and confronting
resistance from within his own party, also spoiled from years in
power in the 1980s and 1990s.
 ""Will he do it? He has no other option,"" said Costas
Panagopoulos, head of ALCO pollsters. ""Society wants blood and
if you don't give them some, they will drink yours.""
 Papandreou came to power promising to tax the rich and help
the poor, and the re-birth of the state after a series of
scandals helped bring his conservative opponents down.
 But he quickly found himself dealing with Greece's biggest
economic crisis in decades. His plans for ""green growth"" were
set aside and the first wave of tax hikes and wage cuts prompted
public demands that those responsible go to jail.
 
 SLOW TO REACT
 His government repeatedly said it was not the time for
punishment but for change, a position analysts said helped
create an impression that all Greek politicians conspire to
cover up for each other.
 They say he has been slow on the social justice front, but
after this week's protests he can no longer underestimate the
force of people's anger.
 ""He appeared reluctant but he is now being forced by social
unrest,"" said Costas Vergos, head analyst at Cyclos Securities.
""I believe he can make it if he tackles corruption and tax
evasion.""
 Papandreou must push through 30 billion euros worth of
austerity measures in exchange for a 110 billion euros EU/IMF
bailout, taking on angry unions protesting wage and pension cuts
with strikes and rallies.
 ""We understand the rage and we feel it as well,"" said
Papandreou, son of the socialist maverick Andreas. ""We are all
to blame for not daring to make the necessary changes sooner.""
 But sympathy will not be enough. Papandreou must effect a
reform in norms as vast as his father's policy of socialist
""Change"" in the 1980s, when he modernised society and generous
EU subsidies helped create a large, affluent middle class.
 Analysts say his task is to limit a gargantuan public sector
bloated through decades of political influence and introduce
meritocracy. The private sector must be freed from both state
constraints and money.
 If such problems, which seriously erode competitiveness, are
not addressed Greece will continue to be the trigger for a wider
euro zone crisis, and face more painful measures down the line.
 
 NEED TO REFORM
 A main hurdle to fighting corruption is a constitutional law
protecting politicians suspected of wrongdoing from prosecution
unless parliament lifts their immunity. Several parliamentary
committees have been investigating scandals but no politician
has ever been brought to justice.
 The ruling party itself has shown some desire to reform. In
a letter to parliament, 48 of its younger members petitioned to
investigate all those who have held public office in the last 20
years and confiscate whatever cannot be justified.
 ""We must have catharsis in our political system to rescue
our political ethos and restore our role as parliamentarians,""
they said.
 Papandreou himself, widely seen as untouched by scandals, is
for the first time showing he is determined to pay the price for
change. Analysts said he could ask his deputies to abandon their
parliamentary immunity, pressuring opposition parties to do the
same, and allow the necessary sacrifices.
 In a show of political muscle flexing, on Thursday he
expelled from the party three deputies who voted against his
austerity bill, cutting his parliamentary majority to 157 in the
300-seat house.
 ""I have known George Papandreou for years and I see he is
now more determined than ever,"" said a government official close
to the premier. ""He is willing to pay the political cost to turn
the page for Greece.""

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the yen
and recovered some losses against the euro on Friday after data
showed U.S. employment grew at the fastest pace in four years
last month.
 Sterling hit a one-year low below $1.45 and fell sharply
against the euro after the UK election left no party with an
outright parliamentary majority.
 The addition of 290,000 jobs was far more than economists
forecast, bolstering expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve
would likely raise interest rates ahead of central banks in
Japan and Europe.
 ""Overall, it's a solid number,"" said Joe Manimbo, a trader
at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. ""We did see
a better-than-expected creation of U.S. jobs in April.""
 The euro briefly retreated to $1.27, but remained above a
14-month low near $1.25 hit on Thursday amid fears that
Greece's debt crisis could spread to other euro-zone states.
 Traders said sentiment toward the euro remained weak, even
after Germany approved its share of a 110 billion euro rescue
for Greece. The currency was down 4.5 percent this week, on
pace for its worst week since late 2008 and down 11 percent
this year.
 ""It's very difficult to see how markets can draw a line
under Greece, and they will keep coming back to the issue of
Greek solvency,"" said Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at
RBC Capital Markets.
 The euro was last up 0.4 percent at $1.2704, off a session
high of $1.2797, but still far from Thursday's 14-month low of
just above $1.25. It was also up 2.8 percent at 117.71 yen
after hitting its lowest level since late 2001 on Thursday. The
dollar rose to 92.50 yen, up 2.1 percent.
 Finance officials from the Group of Seven rich nations
convened a conference call Friday morning to discuss the Greek
situation, although Japan's finance minister said he did not
think they were considering joint currency intervention.
 The U.S. jobs data came after Canada reported a record
108,700 jobs gain in April that helped push the U.S. dollar
down more than 1 percent to C$1.0385.
 Sterling fell to a one-year low of $1.4475, but recovered
to $1.4669 after Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the
Conservatives, who won the most seats in parliament but fell
short of an outright majority, should try to form the next
government.

showed the U.S. economy added a bigger-than-expected 290,000
non-farm payroll jobs in April.
 The data raised the strong possibility that the labour

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Sterling sank to a one-year low
against the dollar and fell steeply against the euro on Friday
as results of a closely fought UK general election showed no one
party would gain an overall majority.
 Results showed the opposition Conservatives would be the
largest party in parliament but without a clear majority,
sparking uncertainty about the composition of the next
government and concerns about how it would tackle the UK's
ballooning deficit.
 However, sterling pared its losses after Moody's Investors
Service said the UK election outcome was no direct threat to its
top-notch 'AAA' rating, while S&P said its view on the UK's
creditworthiness was unchanged.
 Comments from Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal
Democrats, the UK's third party, suggesting his party may be
willing to work with the Conservatives were also seen as
reducing the chances of a political stalemate and gave the pound
a lift.
 ""The ratings agencies' comments have cut off some of the
tail risk that the UK could face an immediate retribution,"" said
Ned Rumpeltin, currency strategist at Nomura.
 ""But there are still a lot of uncertainties and the longer
it takes to form a credible, stable coalition the more it will
be a headwind for sterling"".
 By 1139 GMT, sterling traded 0.6 percent lower against the
dollar at $1.4669, having earlier fallen as low as $1.4475.
 The euro rose 1.4 percent against the pound to 86.88 pence,
leaving it on course for its biggest daily rise in six months in
very choppy trade. The single currency earlier jumped more than
2 percent to a two-week high 88.10 pence.
 Sterling's losses on Friday followed a hefty tumble on
Thursday due to election jitters and put the pound on track to
post a loss of about 4 percent versus the dollar this week, its
worst weekly performance since January 2009.
 This helped push sterling to a one-month low of 78.3 against
a currency basket, retreating from a near three-month high of
80.4 touched on Thursday.
 
 PRESSURE PERSISTS
 UK assets were stung by the inconclusive election results,
with British shares and gilt futures falling, while the spread
between 10-year UK and German government bond yields gapped to a
five-year high.
 Analysts said sterling would stay under selling pressure as
a lack of a strong government able to implement measures to
reduce Britain's deficits would keep alive concerns that the
country's sovereign credit rating could still be cut.
 Overall risk aversion was doing no favours to sterling, as
fears that Greece's debt crisis may spread to other euro zone
nations triggered safe-haven demand for dollars.
 ""With such extreme nervousness coming from the Greek crisis
and worries of a general loss of confidence and liquidity, we
believe there is likely to be further downside pressure on
sterling in the short run, at least against the dollar,""
Barclays analysts said in a note.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - The euro clawed back some of this
week's heavy losses in volatile trade on Friday as investors
perceived selling to be overdone, though concerns the sovereign
debt crisis could spread still weighed on sentiment. 
 The euro recouped losses after falling to its lowest since
December 2001 against the yen on Thursday and hitting a 14-month
low against the dollar. But the rebound was seen limited.
 ""I see this as a corrective rebound from this week's heavy
losses. I expect the bounce to be short-lived and remain
bearish,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP
Paribas.
 The euro rose as high as $1.2797 but was down about 4
percent on the week and on course for its worst weekly
performance since October 2008. By 1122 GMT, it was up 1 percent
on the day at $1.2790.
 ""It's very difficult to see how markets can draw a line
under Greece, and they will keep coming back to the issue of
Greek solvency,"" said Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at
RBC Capital Markets.
 Risk averse markets made for volatile trading in poor
liquidity. Euro/dollar vols were trading at year-to-date highs,
though still some way off the record levels seen in the wake of
the Lehman collapse in 2008.
 One-month euro implied volatility was at 16.00 compared to
around 28.00 at the peak of the Lehman fallout. The risk
reversal moved further in favour of the downside, with one-month
25-delta around 2.75 for euro puts.
 Against the yen, the euro stood at 118.20 yen, up 3 percent
after falling to 110.49 yen on EBS on Thursday.
 Group of Seven finance ministers were to discuss the Greek
debt crisis in a call on Friday, although Japan's finance
minister said he did not think they were considering joint
currency intervention.
 ""The contagion is spreading and creating panic in financial
markets,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. ""The news of the G7 call has soothed, but
it is doubtful that will last.""
 
 HUNG PARLIAMENT
 Sterling sank to a one-year low against the dollar and fell
sharply against the euro as almost complete results of a UK
general election showed there would be a so-called hung
parliament with no one party holding control.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2010 08:12AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Key risks to watch in post-election Britain," By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Britain's general election has
produced the first hung parliament in a generation, with no one
party in overall control and markets already becoming restive
over the possibility political paralysis.
 Below are the key risks to watch in the coming days and
months.
 
 GETTING A NEW GOVERNMENT
 Opposition leader David Cameron's Conservative party have
become the largest party in parliament but lack the outright
majority that would have seen him invited to meet the queen,
form a government and move into Downing Street on Friday.
 Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown remains in office with
constitutionally the first chance to form a government. Third
party the Liberal Democrats performed worse than expected but
now effectively hold much of the balance of power.
 Their leader Nick Clegg said on Friday that as the party
with the most votes and seats, the Conservatives should have the
first chance to form a government -- but that does not
necessarily mean he would support them.
 Mathematically speaking, the Conservatives would need the
support of the Ulster Unionists and possibly other small parties
to win a working majority, or could carry on as a minority
effectively daring the others to force a no-confidence vote and
bring down the government. To be truly safe, they would need at
least the tacit support of the Liberal Democrats to hold off a
no-confidence vote and support the budget.
 Labour and the Liberal Democrats could form a coalition
together, but they would still need other smaller parties to
control more than half of parliament. But keeping the
Conservatives out altogether after they won most votes might
prove politically difficult.
 Some analysts say the best scenario for markets would be a
pact between the Lib Dems and Conservatives -- but that might
prove a hard sell to the Lib Dem party itself and some worry it
would be destabilised by differences on Europe, defence and tax.
 What to watch:
 -- How fast does clarity emerge on a new government?
Sterling and gilts have already fallen sharply on the election
result and if no government is in place by Monday, Britain could
face a sharp sell-off in national assets. Ultimately, the
financial markets -- already made restive by Greece -- could
dictate the timescale of negotiations.
 -- What does Prime Minister Brown do? Clegg has said he
would not keep Brown in office if he lost the popular vote,
leaving open the option of doing a deal with another Labour
leader. Does Brown resign, or is there an internal coup against
him? Other Labour kingpins such as business secretary Peter
Mandelson will be key, with potential contenders for the
leadership including Foreign Secretary David Milliband and Home
Secretary Alan Johnson. If Brown steps down, Queen Elizabeth
could invite whoever she was advised most likely to form a
government to become prime minister, most likely Cameron.
 -- Noises from the three main parties. Sterling rallied
after Clegg said the Conservatives should have the first chance
to form a government. A Lib Dem meeting on Saturday could be key
to their actions. Markets would prefer conciliatory statements
suggesting possible compromises between the parties, and may
react badly to a worsening tone.
 
 WHEN GOVERNMENT IS FORMED
 Forming a government is only the beginning. Credit ratings
agencies and investors have warned Britain needs to begin to
address its record deficit, forecast this year at 11.1 percent
of gross domestic product.
 The Conservatives have promised an emergency budget, and
analysts say any coalition government will likely do the same.
The greater question is whether the budget can get through
parliament and whether it will mollify markets and ratings
agencies.
 Whoever ends up as prime minister, they will need the
support of smaller parties almost continuously. Any strains in
those relationships could unsettle markets and even prompt new
elections.
 What to watch:
 -- the queen's speech outlining policy priorities and budget
-- and the market and ratings agencies' reaction to them -- will
be key. Ratings agencies say all three parties have proposals
that would begin to address the deficit. The question is whether
a fragile government would be prepared to push through tough
measures. The Lib Dems want a more redistributive tax system and
could baulk at supporting a Conservative budget built around
public spending cuts with no tax rises. At the same time, the
electorate might punish any smaller party which was seen to have
scuppered the budget and prompted a new financial crash.
 -- Who emerges as finance minister could also be key to
market credibility. A Reuters poll of financial institutions
showed them viewing Conservative business spokesman and former
Chancellor Ken Clarke as their favoured option. Actual
conservative finance spokesman George Osborne lagged in fourth
place behind Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and Lib Dem
finance spokesman Vince Cable..
 -- Two opposition parties step back into the background, or
do they begin pushing for a no-confidence vote to spark a new
election. Analysts say this is unlikely, as any new election
might result in a larger Conservative victory and punish smaller
parties.
 
 FURTHER RISKS AHEAD
 Markets want to see a strong, stable government but analysts
warn that whatever government emerges from this election will
probably be neither.
 Any minority government will have to work continuously to
keep on board both its allies and own backbench MPs. The need to
get every single MP into the House of Commons chamber to push
through crucial votes can itself make policy making difficult.
Ministers may have to be recalled from overseas visits at short
notice, for example.
 Reigning in the deficit will mean difficult public spending
cuts, which at worst could prompt labour and possibly civil
unrest and would be difficult even for a majority government.
Some analysts warn whoever ends up in power now could easily
lose the next election.
 what to watch:
 -- Another election if the incoming government loses a vote
of confidence. Bookmakers see a one in three chance of a new
election this year.
 -- Is a move towards electoral reform the cost of the
support of smaller parties? This would change Britain's
political system forever, likely ushering in many more coalition
governments, an end to the two-party system and different
policy-making dynamics.
 -- While rating agencies say at present the election result
poses no direct threat to Britain's AAA status, they will
continue to watch closely. Greece, Spain and Portugal have all
recently seen downgrades prompting immediate market routs
 -- Do public spending cuts prompt industrial or even social
unrest, or push the economy back into recession? Either could
worry markets and hit enthusiasm for further tightening.

 By Sujata Rao
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks fell a further 1.8
percent on Friday, and are on track for the biggest weekly fall
in over a year, amid rising risk aversion on fears the euro zone
crisis is spiralling out of control.
 Worries that the Greek debt crisis will deepen and spread to
other weak euro zone economies triggered a sell-off in financial
markets from Asia to Latin America in an indiscriminate dumping
of so-called risky assets.
 While assets found some support from news that the Group of
Seven (G7) nations would discuss the Greek crisis in a
conference call at 1130 GMT, markets are likely to stay jittery
as the crisis overshadows positive economic data and a strong
corporate earnings season.
""The focus has been the euro zone turmoil and investors are
clearly nervous that the problems remain unsolved. There is some
hope that (employment) numbers from the U.S. today will be good
enough to lift sentiment,"" said Marten-Jan Bakkum, strategist at
ING Asset Management in the Hague.
 The emerging benchmark equity index fell 1.8 percent by 1130
GMT, adding to a 2.25 percent decline on Thursday and has now
lost 8.6 percent so far this week. 
 In Asia, Chinese and Indian markets fell 1-2 percent
following a 5 percent drop in Latin America during the previous
session.
 In emerging Europe, the region most exposed to the Greek
crisis and a euro zone growth slowdown, most markets fell 2
percent or more. Moscow shed 3 percent as it was also hit by a
$10 drop in the oil price this past week.
 Turkish stocks fell 3 percent while Polish and Hungarian
stocks were down more than 1.5 percent.
 Emerging markets for a change have played no part in
triggering this latest global crisis but fears of a Greek
default and financial contagion led many panicky investors to
cut exposure to so-called risky assets.
""Markets are being swept by financial contagion. As we know
from previous bouts this works through a domino effect,"" HSBC
analysts said in a note. ""Nothing can be immune including
emerging assets and currencies.""
 Data from fund tracker EPFR Global, however, showed
investors last week continued to pull cash from safe-haven but
low-yield money market funds that saw net outflows of $18
billion. Emerging stock and bond funds still managed to absorb
fresh cash.
 ""Fear has yet to trump the desire to put capital back to
work,"" EPFR analyst Cameron Brandt noted.

 CURRENCIES, BONDS ALSO TAKE HIT
 Emerging currencies saw a tentative recovery following
recent sharp losses. The zloty and the Czech crown rose over
half a percent against the euro, a day after the Polish currency
posted its biggest one-day fall in over a year. 
 But the Hungarian forint, seen as more vulnerable than its
peers, stayed flat, keeping its week-to-date losses at over 5
percent.
 There was a similar rebound in the Turkish lira, which
jumped more than 1 percent off one-year lows to the dollar.
 ""Eastern and central European currencies were oversold and
so clearly there is room for some upside,"" Bakkum of ING said.
 But Polish and Hungarian exposure to Western banks leaves
them vulnerable to further contagion, he warned, referring to
fears investors may try to compensate for losses in Greece and
the euro zone periphery by selling assets in emerging Europe.
 The cost of buying protection via credit default swaps for
Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria rose some 10 basis points across
the board.
 On bonds, the JP Morgan EMBI Plus index saw yield spreads to
U.S. Treasuries fall 9 basis points to 322 bps as Treasury
yields rose off recent lows. Spreads which blew out 28 bps on
Thursday are still near the widest in three months. 
 The Russian rouble slumped to the lowest level this year
against its euro-dollar basket. Having risen to 16-month highs
recently, it is down over 2 percent this week though some of the
moves were exacerbated by thin liquidity caused by May Day
holidays.
 The U.S. employment report due at 1330 GMT is expected to
show 200,000 jobs were added in April compared with 162,000 in
March and could give a boost to sentiment.

 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Britain's election looks to have
produced the most inconclusive result possible - a narrow
victory for the right leaning Conservatives and a Labour PM who
shows no inclination just yet to step aside.
 Financial markets were prepared for many outcomes but not
the scenario of a second-placed Labour, that has no possibility
of cobbling together a stable coalition, clinging to power.
 The pound, gilts and stock market all sold off on Friday..
Markets want clarity fast. They want swift action on Britain's
record budget deficit. That much was clear from a bounce when
Britain's third party, the Liberal Democrats, indicated it was
open to the idea of a Conservative government.
 What the markets fear most is policy paralysis.
 ""The markets will want to know first what the final results
are, but also how things develop over the weekend,"" said Nomura
political analyst Alastair Newton.
 ""But if we have a situation where we don't have a government
by Monday morning it could be a different matter.""
 For now, Prime Minister Gordon Brown remains in office with
constitutionally the first opportunity to form a government and
with senior figures in his left leaning Labour openly reaching
out to the centrist Liberal Democrats with offers of electoral
reform, long desired by Britain's smaller political parties.
 The Conservative line is that Labour has lost its mandate to
govern. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg took the same line on
Friday morning.
 ""It seems this morning that it is the Conservative party
that has more votes and more seats though not an absolute
majority and that is why I think it is now for the Conservative
party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the
national interest,"" Clegg said.
 The most stable coalition in numbers terms would involve the
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, although on paper the
parties are not natural allies. The Liberal Democrats are
pro-EU, unlike the eurosceptic Conservatives, and like Labour
they want to delay deficit cutting measures into next year.
 ""I think (Conservative leader David) Cameron and (Liberal
Democrat leader Nick) Clegg could work together, but I think
Clegg would find that difficult to sell to his party,"" said
Nomura's Newton.
 A meeting of the Liberal Democrat party on Saturday could
prove key in determining who they support. In the meantime,
markets will be watching policymaker statements closely for
signs agreement could be reached.
 
 TAKING AGGRESSIVE TONE?
 ""If you see senior figures from the major parties taking a
very aggressive tone and not conceding to each other I think
people may think it will take a lot longer to form a government
and you could see a much more negative reaction,"" said Wolfang
Piccoli. ""I think the tone so far has not been encouraging. They
don't seem to realise they need to manage expectations.""
 Analysts said they expected much noise over the weekend as
the parties secretly negotiated, but said the key
decision-makers would play their cards close to their chests.
 The key issue for investors -- and credit ratings agencies
which have already warned Britain could risk losing its AAA
status -- is addressing Britain's record deficit. That makes
passage of any emergency budget particularly important, not to
mention the initial market reaction to it.
 Market analysts have been saying that a broad coalition
might prove more capable of fiscal tightening than a minority
government. But the election result leaves parliament so finely
balanced that even putting that together looks relatively
difficult.
 ""Fiscal tightening on the scale needed to get back to fiscal
sustainability may well not be politically sustainable in a
minority government,"" said Citi in a research note.
 But Jefferies chief economist David Owen said he believed
the Conservatives would be able to push through a budget either
as a minority government or in coalition with the Liberal
Democrats.
 ""I don't think this result is a disaster for Britain,"" said
Owen. ""It's just a matter of getting through the next few days
until Gordon Brown accepts the inevitable and resigns. I think
we will wipe possibly get another election in the next 2 to 3
years time horizon but that is not what markets are looking at
right now, they are looking at the immediate future.""

1505,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2010 06:08AM ET</span>",Yuan move could be postponed by Greek crisis-analysts," * Analysts debate impact on yuan policy in Reuters chatroom
 * Beijing seen not wanting to add to global uncertainty
 * Some expect appreciation to wait until late in year
 * Inflationary pressures, U.S. pressure could play role
 SHANGHAI, May 7 (Reuters) - The Greek debt crisis and
worries that it could spill over into other European countries
might prompt China to move more slowly than expected to let the
yuan appreciate, several forex strategists with major banks
said on Friday.
 Markets have expected Beijing to move sometime soon to
unshackle the yuan  from its nearly two-year de facto
peg to the dollar, as inflationary pressures mount and exports
stabilise, making such a step more manageable and even
beneficial in terms of controlling price rises.
 However, the latest round of instability created by the
Greek crisis might prompt policymakers to hold off on any
decisions that could add to already growing volatility in
global markets, analysts said in a debate in a Reuters
chatroom, the Dealing Room.
 ""It doesn't change the internal dynamics of how they are
trying to moderate the different sectors of their domestic
economy, but in terms of timing, they may take market
conditions globally into their decision making process,"" said
Emmanuel Ng, a strategist with OCBC.
 ""It certainly would not be prudent to enact a market-moving
action during market distress,"" Ng said.
 Markets have certainly shifted their expectations of yuan
appreciation over the past week as worries about euro zone
sovereign debt escalated, moving from fevered speculation over
a move by Beijing to a much more cautious stance.
 Just two weeks ago, the offshore forwards market was
pricing in expectations of 3.54 percent strengthening of the
yuan against the dollar over the next year. At one point on
Friday, conversely, dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards were
implying just an 0.84 percent rise in a year's time. [CNY/]
 ""Markets have been too quick to expect an imminent yuan
revaluation, and Greece has forced them to unwind positions,""
said Thio Chin Loo, regional strategist with BNP Paribas.
 Thio is expecting Chinese authorities to wait until the
third quarter to let the yuan appreciate, a view shared by Woon
Khien Chia of Royal Bank of Scotland, who expects greater
currency flexibility to wait until the second half -- and even
the end of the year.
 <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 There is less consensus now than in July 2005, when Beijing
carried out its landmark revaluation, on whether a stronger
currency is needed, Chia said, noting that the government is
also engaged in a campaign against property speculation and may
be loath to add more instability.
 ""About this (Greek) crisis, China at best will do nothing
so as not to contribute to more volatility. To think China will
revalue to save the euro -- I heard some quarters suggesting
this -- is wishful thinking,"" he said.
 Still, other analysts cautioned against reading too much
into the impact that the Greek crisis could have on Beijing's
decisions.
 ""There have been reduced bets on yuan revaluation this week
on the back of Greece trauma, but to say that Beijing will stay
pat and not do anything just because of a European crisis is a
fallacy,"" said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan with CIMB.
 The yuan issue is as much a political issue between
Washington and Beijing as an economic one, Ramanathan said,
meaning the Greek crisis could actually present an opportunity
for China to move in line with its own needs.
 ""If Beijing can deflect attention from being pushed to
revalue more than what it wants on the currency, then this is
the best opportune time for Beijing to do it.""
 Sean Callow with Westpac Bank was even less convinced about
the extent to which the woes in Europe would influence
decision-making in China.
 ""I can't deny that global volatility will encourage those
policymakers who want to procrastinate, citing danger to
exports. But the policy equation on the yuan has not changed
appreciably,"" Callow said.
 The United States and China are due to hold another round
of their Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Beijing on May
24-25, he noted, and the U.S. Treasury is still due to issue a
report in June that could potentially label China a currency
manipulator, he noted.
 Further, consumer inflation is showing signs of becoming
more serious in China, Callow said, requiring more forceful
tightening measures than the three increases in banks' reserve
requirements ratios (RRR) that it has carried out so far this
year, he said.
 ""To me, unless there is a genuine change in the global
economic outlook -- double-dip recession -- then China cannot
afford to risk a trade war with the U.S. by giving them nothing
by, say, late June,"" Callow said.

 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - The euro clawed back losses on

(Recasts, adds quotes)
 By Crispian Balmer
 PARIS, May 7 (Reuters) - France's trade deficit widened
unexpectedly in March, the customs office said on Friday, though
a rise in both imports and exports suggested the economy was
finally moving up a gear.
 The trade deficit in the euro zone's second largest economy
widened to 4.73 billion euros ($6.35 billion) in March from 3.6
billion in February, well above a consensus estimate of 3.45
billion by analysts polled by Reuters. [ID:nLDE64526B] 
 Imports rose 5.5 percent to 36.11 billion euros, pushed
higher by rising energy prices, while exports increased 2.5
percent to 31.38 billion.
 It was the strongest reading for imports since November 2008
and the best score for exports since December 2008.
 ""France has, at last, started to benefit from the global
recovery,"" said Dominique Barbet, a senior economist at bank BNP
Paribas.
 For the first quarter of 2010, France's trade deficit
narrowed to 11.85 billion euros from 12.31 billion in the first
three months of 2009, with exports up 5.2 percent and imports
rising 3.4 percent.
 The strong quarterly performance for exports was greatly
helped by a jump in the sale of transport goods, the customs
office said, up 7.4 percent quarter-on-quarter after a 6 percent
drop in the last three months of 2009.
 An increase in deliveries of Airbus planes played a large
part, with its sales totalling 4.66 billion euros in the first
three months of the year, including 1.68 billion in March.
 
 Q1 GDP SEEN FRAGILE
 ""Even if the trade deficit is widening, it always good news
if exports are going up,"" said Alexander Law of chief economist
of French research firm Xerfi.
 ""It seems to be quite broad-based, apart from for capital
goods. That suggests that international trade is picking up, but
is not getting back to normal and that investment in Europe is
still quite low,"" he added.
 France is due to issue March industrial production data next
Monday and preliminary first quarter gross domestic product
figures on Wednesday.
 Despite signs of a pick up in industrial output, consumer
spending, which is one of the main motors of the economy, has
been depressed in the January-March period. 
 Analysts polled by Reuters have forecast quarter-on-quarter
GDP growth of 0.3 percent, but Xerfi's Law said it might come in
slightly beneath that.
 ""I think GDP is going to be something of a damp squib. I
don't see much in terms of strength in growth,"" he said.
 The recent weakness in the euro, fuelled by the Greek debt
crisis, was expected to lift French exports in the coming
months, but with just under half of French trade taking place
with euro zone partners, the room for a big bounce is limited.
 In other data released on Friday, the budget ministry said
its deficit narrowed to 28.88 billion euros in the first quarter
of 2010 from 46.32 billion in the same period last year.
[ID:nPAB008341]
 The ministry said this improvement was mainly due to a jump
in corporate tax returns. In the first quarter of 2009,
companies were exempted from certain taxes as part of a
government stimulus package to prop up the economy.

 * In line with government forecast for Q1 recession exit
 * Growth likely to remain weak through year ahead
 
 (Updates with details, comment)
 By Nigel Davies
 MADRID, May 7 (Reuters) - Spain emerged from recession in
the first quarter of the year thanks to improving global demand,
breaking a run of seven straight quarters of contraction,
according to a Bank of Spain estimate on Friday.
 Spain's battered stock market <.IBEX>, down 22 percent this
due to fears Spain could follow Greece into a debt crisis,
celebrated the news, rising 2 percent at 1048 GMT after falling
as much as 2 percent before the data was revealed.
 The central bank said in its quarterly report that the
economy grew by 0.1 percent quarter-on-quarter while contracting
in annual terms by 1.3 percent. The forecast is often in line
with the official GDP number due for release on May 12.
 The spread between Spanish government bonds and benchmark
German bunds also improved after the release, easing to 171
basis points from 180 earlier, although still around its highest
level since the inception of the euro zone.
 But analysts warned positive sentiment could soon pass. With
unemployment at 20 percent putting a heavy drag on demand as
well as a drain on government finances, and a heavy load of
private sector debt, any recovery is likely to be weak, they
said.
 Spain needs healthy economic growth if it is to meet its
targets to cut back its fiscal deficit to an EU guideline of 3
percent in 2013 from 11.2 percent in 2009. But economists have
scoffed at the government's forecasts for growth to close in on
3 percent a year by the end of that period.
 ""The information available indicates a return to weak growth
in the first quarter in an environment characterised by a
progressive recovery in the global economy,"" the Bank of report
said.
 The report also said first quarter growth was aided by a
gradual improvement in consumer demand albeit from low levels
and indicators showed it would continue in the second quarter.
 Economists welcomed the news, but suggested the market
wanted to see more from the government, which has promised to
reform its labour markets, and has yet to announce many concrete
measures to cut its deficit.
 ""It's good news today and the markets have picked up on
that. But markets are not really looking at data ... policy,
credibility is what is important,"" said Jose Garcia Zarate at
consultancy 4Cast.
 ""The problem for Spain remains high unemployment. It's still
going to weigh on the economic outlook. The hangover for Spain
from the crisis will be unemployment.""
 The government forecasts the economy to grow in each
quarter this year, but to contract for the year in full by 0.3
percent. In 2011 it forecasts growth of 1.8 percent, and close
to 3 percent in 2012, figures questioned by the European
Commission and International Monetary Fund.
 OUTLOOK PAINFUL
 The Bank of Spain said the first quarter had seen a
stabilisation in housing sales and mortgage data.
 Spain's property sector drove a decade-long boom in the
country before it slumped in 2008. The central bank saw some
improvement in the sector as homebuyers sought to take advantage
of low interest rates and avoid a planned rise in value-added
tax rise in July.
 However, economists did not see good times ahead for Spain.
 ""While today's GDP estimate by the Bank of Spain brings very
good news, the growth outlook remains severely dampened by the
ongoing process of the private sector's deleveraging, and the
needed reallocation of resources associated with the downsizing
of the construction sector,"" said Tullia Bucco, economist at
UniCredit.

* UK election results point to no single party majority
* Euro climbs 1 percent on day vs sterling
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Sterling sank to a one-year low
against the dollar and fell sharply against the euro on Friday
after partial results of a bitterly fought UK general election
suggested no party would have overall control.
 The pound fell as low as $1.4596, its weakest since late
April 2009, as the latest results showed the opposition
Conservatives would be the largest party in parliament but
without a clear majority.
 Analysts said the stalemate was chilling sentiment towards
the pound as a lack of clarity about the composition of the next
government raised uncertainty about how Britain would tackle its
towering deficits.
 ""This hung parliament is not offering a clear, viable easy
coalition resolution,"" said Peter Frank, currency strategist at
Societe Generale.
 ""It's political paralysis, and given other uncertainties,
it's not good timing ... It's not good for sterling,"" he said,
adding he expected further falls in pound in the near term.
 By 0752 GMT, sterling traded 0.3 percent lower on the day at
$1.4725.
 Sterling's losses on Friday followed a hefty tumble on
Thursday due to election jitters and put the pound on track to
post a loss of roughly 4 percent versus the dollar this week,
its worst weekly performance since January 2009.
 The euro rose about 1 percent on the day to 86.75 pence,
before pulling back to 86.35 pence.
 This helped push sterling to 78.7 against a currency basket,
retreating from a near three-month high of 80.4 touched on
Thursday.
 
 PRESSURE PERSISTS
 UK assets were stung by the inconclusive election results,
with British shares falling to their weakest since mid-February,
while gilt futures fell, reversing earlier gains.
 With most of the votes counted, neither a combination of the
ruling Labour party and the Liberal Democrats nor one of the
Conservatives and the Ulster Unionists looked to be able make up
a majority, opening up the prospect of political stalemate.
 ""It's as bad as it gets,"" a London-based FX trader.
 ""Labour/Liberal Democrats cannot get a majority, Tory/Ulster
Union cannot get majority, Tory/LibDem won't deal with each
other.""
 Analysts said sterling would stay under selling pressure as
a lack of a strong government able to implement measures to
reduce Britain's deficits may also raise speculation the
country's sovereign credit rating could be cut.
 Overall risk aversion was doing no favours to sterling, as
fears that Greece's debt crisis may spread to other euro zone
nations triggered safe-haven demand for dollars.
 ""With such extreme nervousness coming from the Greek crisis
and worries of a general loss of confidence and liquidity, we
believe there is likely to be further downside pressure on GBP
in the short run, at least against the USD,"" Barclays analysts
said in a note.

 * Domestic energy demand growth big issue for Arab ministers
 * Arab oil ministers meet in Doha May 9-12

 By Simon Webb
 DUBAI, May 7 (Reuters) - Arab oil ministers gathering in
Qatar have crude prices where they want them even after a more
than 10 percent fall driven by concern other European nations
could suffer a debt crisis similar to that of Greece.
 OPEC-members attending an Arab Energy Conference will be
watching international oil markets for further falls, but also
have the challenge of meeting rapidly rising energy demand at
home high on their agendas.
 ""The concern for producers will be what happens if the
sovereign debt crisis spreads across Europe and over the
Atlantic,"" said Victor Shum, an analyst at energy consultancy
Purvin & Gertz. ""This will scupper the global economic
recovery.""
 The conference in Doha from Sunday until Wednesday is not an
OPEC gathering, but oil ministers will probably hold informal
meetings on the sidelines of the four-day event. Ministers from
OPEC members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Kuwait, Algeria and Libya were expected to attend.
 ""Issues related to OPEC supply will be discussed,"" said one
OPEC delegate. ""But the oil price is not based on fundamentals
and is moving on fluctuations in the U.S. dollar.""
 U.S. crude hit a 19-month high on Monday of $87.15, but has
since fallen back sharply, dropping to an intra-day low below
$75 a barrel on Thursday, its weakest since February. It was
back above $77 on Friday.
 The extent of the fall and the volatility could worry some
OPEC ministers, but the price is back in the $70 to $80 per
barrel range the group's largest producer Saudi Arabia has said
was fair for consumers and producers.
 ""The price is still in a good place for the Saudis,"" said
Bill Farren-Price of consultancy Petroleum Policy Intelligence.
""I don't hear anybody complaining. Below $70 would be a
different story.""
 Oil has mostly traded above $80 since early March, and
Kuwait's oil minister last week talked of stepping in to calm
the rally if the price hit $100.
 OPEC ministers question the link between the price and oil
market fundamentals. The price has stayed high in defiance of
brimming global inventories, tepid demand growth in most of the
world and a relatively high level of spare capacity among
members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
 OPEC is not scheduled to meet formally until October and has
kept oil supply targets steady since late 2008. Higher prices
have encouraged some members to boost output informally, but
core Gulf Arab members Saudi, the UAE and Kuwait have stuck to
output restraints.
 
 DOMESTIC DEMAND
 A petrodollar-fuelled economic boom in much of the Arab
region has left governments in some of the world's top oil
producing countries struggling to meet domestic demand for gas
and power.
 ""Unfettered growth in demand in these countries as a result
of cheap or subsidised prices is something they will have to
deal with at some point,"" said Farren-Price. ""It is impossible
to service the growth in energy demand at the rate experienced
in most of these countries.""
 Saudi state oil giant Aramco warned last month Saudi
Arabia's capacity to export would be eroded in the next 20 years
if consumption continued to grow at current rates and energy
efficiency was unimproved.
 Its capacity to export could fall by 3 million barrels per
day by 2028 to less than 7 million bpd, Aramco Chief Executive
Khaled al-Falih said.
 The world's top oil reserve holder Saudi Arabia experienced
power shortages last year and also lacks gas supplies to meet
power demand and industry needs.
 Its Gulf Arab neighbours, with the exception of top LNG
exporter Qatar, are also short of gas supplies.
 Gulf countries have established a power grid that may help
them to meet individual electricity shortfalls in the future.
But for now, none of them has much power to sell into the grid.
 Building the refineries and infrastructure needed to meet
domestic energy demand was also a problem for some countries
because of the challenge of raising project financing,
Farren-Price said.
 Third-largest oil exporter the United Arab Emirates has
announced it would slowly raise subsidised retail gasoline
prices to international market rates.
 That might herald a similar change from Gulf Arab neighbours
in a region which has typically sold some of the world's
cheapest fuel.
 The Arab Energy Conference takes place every four years and
is jointly sponsored by the Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OAPEC) and the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development (AFESD).

 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - World stocks held near a
three-month low on Friday despite strong U.S. job data and the
euro traded close to a one-year trough, weighed down by
persistent fears over the euro zone debt crisis.
 The better-than-expected jobs figures, showing the U.S.
economy added 290,000 non-farm payroll jobs in April, did not
give lasting support to risky assets. [nN06115059]. U.S. stocks
opened lower and oil prices erased gains.
 Sterling, which is also sensitive to risk aversion, bounced
off an earlier one-year low against the dollar after comments
from Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg lessened the risk of a
political stalemate and ratings agencies said Britain's AAA
status was not under threat from the election.
 Wall Street was set for a modestly higher open after the Dow
suffered its biggest ever intraday point drop on Thursday.
Concerns about the euro debt woes persisted as investors feared
further escalation in the crisis would hit growth and sentiment.
 ""It certainly didn't disappoint on the number of new jobs
created but I guess the question now is: is the overhang from

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - The euro clawed back losses on
Friday but was still on track for big falls on the week as
concerns that Greece's debt problems would spread to other euro
zone countries prompted investors to shed riskier assets.
 The euro fell to its lowest since December 2001 against the
yen on Thursday and hit a 14-month low against the dollar.
 It later recouped losses and was further boosted after a
U.S. Treasury official said G7 finance ministers would discuss
the Greek debt crisis in a call on Friday, although Japan's
finance minister said he did not think they were considering
joint FX intervention.
 ""The contagion is spreading and creating panic in financial
markets,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. ""The news of the G7 call has soothed, but
it is doubtful that will last.""
 The euro rose as high as $1.2737 on trading platform EBS but

up 0.2 percent at $1.2690.

 Risk averse markets made for thin, volatile conditions.
Euro/dollar vols were trading at year-to-date highs, though
still some way off the record levels seen in the wake of the
Lehman collapse in 2008. 
 One-month euro implied volatility was at 16.25 compared to
around 28.00 at the peak of the Lehman fallout. The risk
reversal moved further in favour of the downside, with one-month
25-delta around 2.75 for euro puts.
 Against the yen, the euro stood at 117.24 yen, up 2.3
percent. It dropped to 110.49 yen on EBS on Thursday, when it
shed 5 percent on the day and hit its weakest level since
December 2001, according to Reuters data.
 ""The market is at loss as to where to find a conclusion to
this Greece debt problem and there is fear that problems will

Japanese trust bank.
 
 HUNG PARLIAMENT
 Sterling sank to a one-year low against the dollar and fell
sharply against the euro as partial results of a UK general
election suggested there would be a hung parliament with no one
party emerging as a clear winner.
 The opposition Conservatives were forecast to become the
biggest party but were seen falling just short of an outright
majority in parliament.
 Labour's Gordon Brown remains prime minister and the
incumbent has the right to try to form a government, but may
have difficulty in forming a coalition to retain power.
 ""A hung parliament should have already been priced in to
sterling, but with uncertainty over the shape of the new
government and therefore economic policy likely to continue in
to next week the currency should remain on the back foot,"" said
Stuart Bennett, currency strategist at Credit Agricole CIB.
 The renewed rush to safety supported the dollar and the yen.
The dollar index was at 84.91, not far from Thursday's one-year
high of 85.27.
 The dollar could get a boost if the U.S. employment report
later in the day shows 200,000 jobs were added in April, as
forecast, up from 162,000 in March..
 The dollar also pared a chunk of its losses on the yen,
rising above 92.00 yen, after hitting 87.95 on Thursday when it
shed nearly 4 percent.

 * PM Brown stays put, makes own overture towards Lib Dems

(Updates with officials in talks, weekend of deliberations)
 By Estelle Shirbon
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Conservatives
offered to work with their smaller Liberal Democrats rivals in
government on Friday after a dramatic parliamentary election that
produced no outright winner for the first time since 1974.
 The result unnerved investors worried that a weak government
and protracted negotiations over who should lead the country
would hamper efforts to cut the country's massive debts.
 The centre-right Conservatives won the most seats in the
650-seat House of Commons, comfortably ahead of the ruling
centre-left Labour Party but not in overall control. The
centrist Liberal Democrats came a distant third.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown remained in office in a
caretaker role pending the emergence of a new government, in
accordance with British constitutional convention.
 He said the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had every
right to try to do a deal first but was ready to talk to the Lib
Dems about an agreement if discussions failed. A Lib Dem/
Conservative deal would almost certainly end his tenure as party
leader.
 Thursday's poll, marred by scenes of anger as hundreds of
voters were unable to cast their ballots due to administrative
problems, left none of the three big parties satisfied.
 The Conservatives came tantalisingly close to an outright
win but were left at the mercy of smaller parties. Ahead in the
polls by double digits for most of last year, they saw their
lead shrink in recent months despite voter fatigue with Labour.
 For Labour, hopes of extending their 13 years in office
looked tenuous, while a predicted Lib Dem surge did not happen.
 With results in 649 out of the 650 parliamentary
constituencies declared, the Conservatives had won 306 seats,
followed by Labour on 258 and the Lib Dems on 57.

 ""A STRONG BASIS FOR A STRONG GOVERNMENT""
 Conservative leader David Cameron said Britain urgently
needed a strong government to reassure jittery markets that it
was serious about tackling the country's record budget deficit,
which exceeds 11 percent of national output.
 ""No government will be in the national interest unless it
deals with the biggest threat to our national interest, and that
is the deficit. We remain completely convinced that starting to
deal with the deficit this year is essential,"" Cameron said.
 The Conservatives were in power for most of the 20th century
but they lost three successive elections to Labour from 1997.
Cameron is under intense pressure to lead them back into office.
 He said one possibility was a minority Conservative
government seeking support from other parties issue by issue,
but he would also offer the Lib Dems a more formal agreement,
which could include coalition government. This is extremely rare
in modern British politics.
 Possible areas of agreement included reforming tax and
electoral systems and reversing a planned increase in payroll
tax, Cameron said, signalling that the Conservatives would be
less open to compromise on European and defence issues.
 Cameron has said he would make deeper and faster spending
cuts than Labour or the Liberal Democrats, who have both warned
this would harm a fragile recovery.
 His statement went some way to calming investor fears of
political deadlock and British government bonds and sterling
recouped earlier losses.
 But both sides will have to work hard to convince party
faithful about the merits of a seemingly awkward partnership and
that could make any deal short-lived.

 * Says insurance unit has just under 400 mln sovereign risk
 * Confirms bank sovereign exposure at 850 million euros
(Adds details, results expectations)
 By Lionel Laurent
 PARIS, May 7 (Reuters) - French bank Credit Agricole
revealed a total exposure to Greece of 3.8 billion euros ($5.1
billion) on Friday, as debt worries continued to pressure the
financial sector.
 Credit Agricole, which reports first-quarter results next
week, was seen as particularly vulnerable to Greece's economic
problems because of its unprofitable Greek subsidiary Emporiki
in which it bought a two thirds stake in 2006.
 The Greek unit, now over 90 percent-owned, has been sapping
results for years while the bank's former chief executive,
Georges Pauget, said it would not sell out.
 Credit Agricole was expected to report a first-quarter net
profit of 514 million euros, more than double what it earned in
the 2009 period, according to a Reuters poll.
 The updated 3.8 billion euro exposure figure included bank
sovereign risk of 850 million, insurance sovereign risk of just
under 400 million, investment-banking corporate exposure of 2.4
billion and interbank risk exposure of 180 million.
 The figure does not include private-sector exposure at
Emporiki, the bank said.
 Credit Agricole shares were down 1.4 percent in morning
trade, in line with declines at larger rivals BNP Paribas and
Societe Generale.
 BNP has disclosed sovereign exposure to Greece of 5 billion
euros and corporate commitments of around 3 billion. Societe
Generale's sovereign exposure is 3 billion euros.
 Credit Agricole has restructured itself in the aftermath of

1516,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2010 02:12AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Hungary must continue fiscal adjustment -c.bank head," * Tax cuts must be offset, structural reforms needed
 * Sustainability, stability needed for euro adoption
 * Cbanks need wider tools to prevent hot money inflows
(Adds comments, detail)
 BUDAPEST, May 7 (Reuters) - Hungary must continue to get
its finances in order and should aim to adopt the euro as soon
as possible, the central bank chief said, adding that its
introduction should be based on sound economic fundamentals.
 ""...It would be definitely important to make progress in
eliminating the Hungarian economy's competitive
disadvantages... and within this it's essential that fiscal
consolidation must continue,"" central bank Governor Andras
Simor wrote in an article published on news portal Index.hu on
Friday.
 Simor said experiences from managing the financial crisis
in Hungary have made euro adoption even more desirable, but the
latest European developments have shown the currency is not
some kind of ""miraculous remedy"".
 ""The advantages stemming from euro adoption can be utilised
-- as it has been proved by Greek events -- only if it is also
fully supported by disciplined economic policy,"" he said.
 He also said the fulfilment of euro adoption criteria will
likely be judged much more strictly in the future and a
credible euro target date can be set only based on stable
fundamentals.
 ""Therefore, Hungary's euro adoption strategy must focus on
sustainability and ensuring economic stability.""
 In a new Reuters poll on Thursday Poland, Bulgaria, Romania
and Hungary were still seen adopting the euro in 2015 but
forecasters scaled back their median forecast for the Czech
Republic's euro accession by a year to 2016.
 ""Our vulnerability due to the high external debt and public
debt can prevail for a longer period, and the risk assessment
of the country can worsen due to factors beyond our influence.
This risk can be reduced only if economic policy continuously
proves its commitment to stability,"" Simor added.
 Simor, who has come under attack for his private
investments from the centre-right Fidesz party since it won
elections last month, also said any tax cuts should be offset
on the spending side and urged structural reforms.
 ""Further tax reductions while also maintaining budget
balance can be achieved only by decreasing redistribution by
the state,"" he said. Fidesz wants to cut taxes starting this
year.
 WIDER SET OF TOOLS
 He said the crisis has shown that central banks need a
wider set of tools to be able to stem hot money inflows and
prevent credit booms, as interest rate policy often does not
work effectively enough in these cases.
 ""Considering the whole process which generates overheating,
the most appropriate point to intervene and the best tool must
be found, which can range from restricting capital flows to
more active intervention in the fx market to limiting banks'
risk taking.""
 He said tighter regulation of financial institutions was a
key to policy to prevent credit booms.
 Simor reiterated that inflation was expected to fall below
the bank's 3 percent target in 2011.
 ""The task of the central bank ... is to help the economy's
recovery by easing monetary conditions during a recession, but
not allow a price-wage inflation spiral... reemerge as growth
starts again.""

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Sterling sank to a one-year low
against the dollar and fell sharply against the euro on Friday
after incoming results of a UK general election suggested the
country was heading towards a hung parliament.
 The pound fell as low as $1.4596, its weakest since late
April 2009, as ongoing vote tallies showed the opposition
Conservatives were on course to become the largest party in
parliament but lacked a clear majority. [ID:nLDE64600H]
 Analysts said the stalemate was chilling sentiment for the
pound, driving it down as London trade got underway.
 ""You've seen a significant swing towards the Conservative
party but at this stage the polls, particularly the exit polls,
are still pointing to a hung parliament,"" said David Forrester,
vice president of global FX strategy at Barclays Capital in
Singapore.
 ""The clearer the result, the better for the currency.""
 By 0601 GMT, sterling  traded 0.5 percent lower on
the day at $1.4692.
 The euro  rose roughly 1 percent on the day to
86.75 pence, before pulling back to 86.45 pence.
 With a majority of the votes counted, neither a combination
of the ruling Labour party and the Liberal Democrats nor one of
the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionists looked to be able
make up a majority, which may lead to political stalemate.
 ""It's as bad as it gets,"" said a London-based trader.
 ""Labour/Liberal Democrats cannot get a majority,
Tory/Ulster Union cannot get majority, Tory/LibDem won't deal

 By David Milliken and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Sterling and gilts recouped early
massive losses in a rollercoaster day on Friday, after initial
jitters about the inconclusive outcome to Britain's closest
election since 1974 eased on prospects of a deal between
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
 Imminent talks between the two main centre-right and
centre-left opposition parties boosted chances that British
politicians will be able to agree soon on deficit-cutting plans
-- vital for markets given a turbulent international backdrop
that has sent shares tumbling.
 The FTSE-100 index of top British shares closed at a
six-month low of 5,123, down 2.6 percent on the day after a 3.9
percent fall by its European counterpart driven by worries about
the risk of a Greek government bond default.
 The spread between British and German government bond yields
-- a barometer of how worried investors are about the UK fiscal
outlook -- hit its highest in at least 12 years at 124.8 basis
points, but by late in the day was almost unchanged versus late
Thursday at 102 basis points.
 Gilt prices ebbed and flowed based on televised statements
by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, head of a caretaker government
now his Labour Party has lost its majority, and Conservative
leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat chief Nick Clegg.
 ""Cameron's 'big, open' offer to Clegg helped to contain the
bloodbath in gilts at least in part ... (but) the formation of
this coalition could be a very slow process and the market will
not like that,"" said Matteo Regesta, fixed income strategist at
BNP Paribas.
 The June gilt future had the highest daily trading volume
for a front-month long gilt future since the derivative's launch
in 1982 as well as the widest trading range since the Bank of
England started quantitative easing last year.
 With one seat left to declare, the Conservatives had won 306
seats, Labour 258, the Liberal Democrats 57 and other parties 28
seats in the 650-seat lower house of parliament.
 Sterling hit a 12-month low below $1.4475, down almost 3
cents on the day, but later recovered to be little changed on
the day at $1.4766. Against the euro, sterling weakened slightly
on the day.
 ""The comments from Clegg and then Cameron gave sterling some
relief, but ... questions remain over whether the Conservatives
and the Liberal Democrats can work together,"" said currency
strategist Audrey Childe-Freeman at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 ""The market is very much focused on what measures the new
government will take to address the UK's debt predicament over
the next few quarters,"" she added.
 An outright win for the Conservatives had been seen by many
investors as the most beneficial outcome for both sterling and
UK government bonds, given the centre-right party's tough talk
on cutting the deficit.
 An indecisive result, with potentially days or even weeks of
horse-trading, had been regarded as the worst possible outcome
for UK assets as pressure mounts on the government to curb
borrowing.
 Ratings agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's said election
result did not pose an immediate threat to Britain's triple-A
sovereign rating. But analysts warned that investors could lose
patience fast.
 ""Without clarity, the market will drift and there's little
compelling reason to support sterling assets,"" said Moyeen
Islam, strategist at Barclays Capital. 
 ""This is totally uncharted water for the UK and for most
market participants. We just don't know where we're going to end
up or how we're going to get there.""

 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - The euro nursed chunky losses on
Friday after news that finance ministers from Group of Seven
nations will discuss debt-stricken Greece later in the day, while
sterling hit a 1-year low against the dollar on political
uncertainty in Britain.
 The euro scraped back above $1.2700 after marking its latest
14-month low of $1.2510 on Thursday and shedding 1.6 percent when
a steep plunge in U.S. stocks had regulators investigating
whether erroneous trades had caused the fall.
 Its rebound extended after a U.S. Treasury official said G7
finance ministers would discuss the Greek debt situation in a
call on Friday, although Japan's finance minister said he did not
think they were considering joint FX intervention.
 Investor concern that Greece's debt woes could infect other
debt-strapped euro zone members and possibly spread beyond Europe
has caused a global rout which knocked down the euro and sent the
dollar and the yen soaring.
 ""It's important to recognise that Japanese officials have
come out and said joint intervention is unlikely which hoses down
the expectations that were created by the announcement (of the
call),"" said David Forrester, vice president of global FX
strategy at Barclays Capital in Singapore.
 ""What you'd expect ... is reassurance by European officials
towards other G7 officials as well as global markets that they
are working to solve Greek the problem.
 The euro pulled up as high as $1.2737 on trading platform EBS
but has lost about 4.5 percent on the week and is on course for
its worst weekly performance since October 2008.
 It stood at 116.70 yen after dropping as far as 110.49 yen on
trading platform EBS on Thursday, when it shed 5 percent on the
day and hit its weakest level since December 2001, according to
Reuters data.
 It pulled back up to 1.4115 Swiss francs after hitting a
record low of 1.4005 francs the day before.
 ""The market is at loss as to where to find a conclusion to
this Greece debt problem and there is fear that problems will
spread to other countries,"" said a prop trader at a Japanese
trust bank.
 The renewed rush to safety supported the dollar and the yen.
The dollar index was at 84.92, not far from a one-year high of
85.27.
 The dollar could get a boost if U.S. jobs later in the day
show 200,000 jobs were added in April, up from 162,000 in March..
 The dollar also pared a chunk of its losses on the yen,
rising above 92.00 yen, after hitting 87.95 on Thursday when it
shed nearly 4 percent.
 TORY FORECAST
 Sterling fell 1 percent to $1.4638 after dropping as low as
$1.4596, its lowest since April 2009.
 The opposition Conservatives were forecast to emerge as the
largest party after the closest election in three decades in
Britain, but seen falling just short of an outright majority in
parliament.
 Many believe political uncertainty could derail any quick
plans to put UK public finances in order and could prompt credit
agencies to downgrade Britain from its AAA status.
 ""On election night in Britain we are seeing European
sovereign debt problems playing a big part in the pound's fall,""
said Joseph Capurso, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.
""The Greek contagion is moving to markets in Spain and Italy and
that is definitely worrisome.""

 By Stanley White and Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - Group of Seven finance ministers are
unlikely to discuss the possibility of joint intervention in
markets to support the euro in phone talks on Friday, Japan's
finance minister said.
 The euro rose against the dollar and the yen on Friday after
a U.S. Treasury official said G7 finance ministers would discuss
Greece's debt situation in a call the same day.
 Finance Minister Naoto Kan, when asked about the Treasury
official's comment, looked unsurprised but said Japan was
unlikely to be asked to do much beyond expressing support for EU
and IMF efforts to rescue Greece.
 ""I don't think this call is about joint intervention. I don't
think the G7 is moving towards joint intervention to support the
euro,"" Kan said in a news conference.
 ""I don't want to speculate about what else will be discussed
on the call. The EU and the IMF have agreed to help Greece. Japan
will watch that process closely.""
 The euro tumbled to a 14-month low against the dollar and the
yen surged on Thursday as fears of contagion stemming from the
Greek debt crisis escalated and pushed U.S. stocks into negative
territory for the year.
 Despite Kan's comments ruling out joint intervention, markets
were on the lookout for any fresh message from the G7 on how it
will deal with widening fallout from the Greek debt crisis.
 ""I don't think joint intervention is likely, but the G7 could
say they dislike volatile markets,"" said Shinichi Takasaka,
manager of FX and financial products trading at Mitsubishi UFJ
Trust & Banking Co in Tokyo.
 ""If the European Central Bank doesn't come up with
appropriate measures, which I think it hasn't done so far, then
the G7 might have to persuade the ECB to come up with something
else. Markets are losing confidence.""
 JAPAN ALARMED
 The yen's surge and sharp falls in Tokyo share prices have
alarmed Japanese policymakers.
 The Bank of Japan offered 2 trillion yen ($22.03 billion) in
funds to financial institutions in an emergency market operation
aimed at soothing market jitters, the first time it has supplied
liquidity on a same-day basis in about five months.
 Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said on Friday he was
""very worried"" about the market moves and said the government
will act accordingly if needed, without elaborating.
 The government's chief cabinet spokesman also said he was
closely watching the impact that a strong yen could have on
Japan's still-fragile economic recovery.
 But Kan did not comment directly on whether Japan could step
into the currency market to stem yen gains, only saying that
currency levels should be determined by markets.
 He also repeated that it was the shared understanding among
G7 countries that excessive and disorderly currency moves were
undesirable.
 Kan said that while U.S. and Japanese share prices have
fallen sharply, he expected market moves to stabilise over time
with a framework for rescuing Greece now in place.
 The IMF board is to meet on Sunday in Washington to act on
its part of an aid package for Greece amounting to some 30
billion euros (around $40 billion), while the EU is to put up
about 80 million euros of loans for Greece.
 Greek lawmakers approved a 30 billion euro austerity bill on
Thursday, paving the way for the record bailout from the EU and
the IMF.
 Japan's Nikkei average fell more than 4 percent to a
two-month low on Friday, with exporters such as Canon Inc
battered by worries that a stronger yen would curb their profits
when repatriated.
 A strong yen hurts Japan's export-reliant economy as it hurts
the competitive advantage of Japanese goods overseas.

 * But market turmoil threatens rosy outlook
 * Investors even toy with chance latest hike could be
unwound
 By Wayne Cole
 SYDNEY, May 7 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank raised
forecasts for economic growth and inflation on Friday, but its
optimism risked being dampened as turmoil in global markets
threatened to force a rethink of future rate hikes.
 Indeed, investors wondered whether the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) had gone a step too far in lifting interest
rates to 4.5 percent this week, way ahead of any other major
central bank. Interbank futures even showed a small chance of a
rate cut next month.
 ""The RBA will hold those upbeat views with much less
confidence today than when its forecasts were finalised a week
ago,"" said Rory Robertson, interest rate strategist at
Macquarie.
 ""The unpleasant risk that problems in Europe ultimately
will drag down the global economy and markets seems somewhat
greater today than a week ago,"" he warned. ""The RBA almost
certainly will be on-hold for next few months, and perhaps for
much longer.""
 When the central bank raised its key cash rate by 25 basis
points on Tuesday, the market had confidently assumed a further
hike would come by August and rates would top 5 percent by
year-end.
Now, futures had priced out any chance of a tightening before
October. In fact, markets implied a 7 percent probability the
central bank might have to take back the latest hike at its
policy meeting on June 1.
 The RBA has been the most aggressive central bank in
withdrawing some of the extraordinary monetary acommodation
provided in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It
has raised rates by 150 basis points since last October,
 The upbeat reasoning behind the latest hike was set out in
its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, a 58-page
assessment of the global and domestic economies.
 The RBA did concede some danger that sovereign debt
problems in Europe could lead to a rush from risk and so impact
the world economy. But it also saw a risk global growth could
continue to surprise on the upside and that Australia's booming
terms of trade would lead to greater demand than currently
expected.
 TERMS OF TRADE BOOM
 Trade featured prominently in the statement as huge price
increases for iron ore and coal, Australia's two biggest
exports, are expected to shower money on the economy through
higher profits, investment, wages and tax receipts.
 The outlook for mining investment was particularly strong
with many major projects started or in the pipeline aimed at
meeting voracious demand from China and India.
 The RBA estimated Australia's terms of trade - the ratio of
export prices to import prices - would rise around 20 percent
this year and boost domestic incomes by around 4 percent, a
significantly stronger outcome than expected.
 Indeed, the RBA said nominal gross domestic product could
increase by a whopping 10 percent in 2010, well above
inflation-adjusted growth.
 Real GDP was seen rising 3.25 percent in 2010 and 3.75
percent in 2011 before accelerating further to 4 percent by the
end of 2012. That was up from a previous forecast of 3.5
percent. Underlying inflation was now seen running at 2.75
percent through to the end of 2011. Inflation was forecast to
reach 3 percent by June 2012, again up from 2.75 percent and
the top of the RBA's target band.
 ""Although inflation has moderated, the extent of the
moderation now looks as though it will not be as large as
previously thought,"" wrote RBA Governor Glenn Stevens, pointing
to widespread increases in the costs of services and utilities.
 As before, the RBA noted that these forecasts assumed some
further rise in the cash rate broadly in line with market
expectations, though that did not mean the bank was committed
to any particular policy course.
 The central bank was upbeat on the outlook for employment
noting forward indicators from business surveys and vacancies
pointed to solid growth in coming quarters and a further
gradual fall in the already low 5.3 percent unemployment rate.

 By Wayne Cole and Charlotte Cooper
 SYDNEY/TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - The pound and the euro nursed
chunky losses on Friday after a global rout sent the dollar and
yen soaring, with Asian share markets falling on a Wall Street
sell-off and sterling hurt by election uncertainty.
 The euro scraped back to $1.2700 after hitting its latest

Group of Seven finance ministers would discuss the Greek debt
situation in a call on Friday, although Japan's finance minister
said he did not think they were considering joint FX

 With investors already running scared from euro zone debt
troubles, Thursday's rout compounded risk aversion, keeping the
dollar index close to a one-year high and the yen strong after it
hit an eight-year peak against the euro the day before.
 ""I think we'll see a pop from here but I suspect we are not
done,"" said one trader at a UK bank.

 The euro pulled up to $1.2710 but has lost about 4.5 percent

Reuters data.
 It pulled back up to 1.4140 Swiss francs after hitting a
record low of 1.4005 francs the day before.
 Political uncertainty in Britain also served to cloud the
situation.
 The opposition Conservatives were forecast to emerge as the
largest party after the closest election in three decades, but
seen falling just short of an outright majority in parliament.
The prospect of the first inconclusive election since 1974
left uncertainty about who would form the next government, with
the sense of chaos heightened by reports that hundreds of voters
had been turned away from crowded polling stations across the
country when voting ended at 2100 GMT.
 Many believe political uncertainty could derail any quick
plans to put UK public finances in order and could prompt credit
agencies to downgrade Britain from its AAA status.
 Sterling stood at $1.4840, having collapsed from above
$1.5100 overnight to as far as $1.4712, its lowest in over a
year.
 The pound was also smashed in the rout by the safe-haven yen,
shedding 12 yen at one stage to near 130.00 yen before bouncing
slightly to 137.14.
 ""On election night in Britain we are seeing European
sovereign debt problems playing a big part in the pound's fall,""
said Joseph Capurso, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.

 * Euro huddled at 14-month lows on Greek debt crisis
 By Koh Gui Qing
 SYDNEY, May 7 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were hammered on
Friday as mounting fears over Europe's debt crisis sparked a
global market rout that sent safe-haven assets soaring and
clobbered sterling.
 A near 1,000-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average at one stage, led some investors to recall the mayhem
in world markets after the collapse of U.S. bank Lehman
Brothers in 2008.
 Sterling was especially hard hit overnight as it suffered a
further dose of uncertainty from exit polls that showed no one
UK party may hold a majority in parliament. [ID:nLDE6452N3] It
shed 12 yen against the safe-haven Japanese currency at one
point .
 The wild swings in prices forced some traders in Asia to
work from home early Friday or get to work earlier than usual.
 ""The Greece debt crisis is reminding investors of what
happened after Lehman Brothers' collapse,"" said Kazuhiro
Takahashi, general manager at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets.
 ""A failure by one financial institution ended up triggering
a ripple effect on the global economy.""
 The Greek parliament backed an austerity plan on Thursday,
but selling had accelerated across markets overnight after the
European Central Bank said it had not considered buying
government bonds to ease Greece's debt crisis. Some investors
had hoped it would be more active in calming markets.
 That kept the euro  languishing near 14-month
troughs. It was weak at $1.2661 on Friday, crawling back from
New York's close of $1.2605 but still far below last week's
$1.3295 finish.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> skidded nearly 4 percent, its worse
day in slightly over a year.
 Exporters were hard hit, hurt by a soaring yen  that
leapt nearly 4 percent in New York trade as investors rushed to
buy safer assets.
 Digital camera maker Canon lost 4.7 percent and chip-tester
maker Advantest Corp <6857.T> shed 4.8 percent. Automaker Honda
Motor Co <7267.T> skidded 4.1 percent.
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> slumped 2.4 percent, its biggest daily fall in
three months.
 The dash for safety pushed gold  to near record highs
and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to five-month lows.
 However, while bond yields dived borrowing costs between
banks jumped, another echo of the global financial crisis.
 ""This brief rerun of the darkest days of 12-24 months ago
is a real confidence killer for leveraged investors, not to
mention the rest of us,"" said Rory Robertson, an interest rate
strategist at Macquarie in Sydney.
 ""The real worry is that the growing risk aversion via
growing problems in Europe is driving up funding costs across
the global financial system.""
 The U.S. dollar pared losses slightly against the yen to
trade at 90.78 yen , from 90.17 in New York, but that
compared to 93.80 this time Thursday. It shed five whole yen at
one point on Thursday.
 The dollar index <.DXY> held near one-year highs at 84.9,
as the U.S. currency gained elsewhere from the super safe-haven
status of Treasuries.
 U.S. stocks had dived as much as 9 percent at one stage on
Thursday as losses triggered by Europe's debt crisis sparked a
stampede of automated selling. There were investigations,
however, about whether a trading glitch had magnified losses.
 ""It was the craziest day I've ever had,"" said Mark
Galorenzo, an options trader at TMT East, as he left the New
York Stock Exchange on Thursday. ""It was worse than 2008 -- the
market sold off faster and deeper."" [ID:nN06132661]
 In further evidence that Greece's debt crisis was spreading
across Europe, data showed a net of outflow in excess of $2
billion from Europe equity funds in the week to May 5.
 The rout in markets caused the VIX <.VIX>, Wall Street's
favoured gauge of investor anxiety, to spike to one-year highs
in New York trade, a screeching turn from 33-month lows seen
only in April.
 That said, the VIX is still about 80 percent below peaks
seen in 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.

fall

 By Koh Gui Qing and Miral Fahmy
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE May 7 (Reuters) - European stocks are
primed for a pummelling on Friday, following ravaged U.S. and
Asian shares, as Europe's debt crisis sent waves of dread
through global markets and battered sterling and the euro.
 U.S. stocks plunged 9 percent in the last two hours of
trading on Thursday before clawing back some of the losses as a
suspected trading glitch and fears of a new credit crunch in
Europe threw markets into disarray. [ID:nN06132661]
 Sterling was especially hard hit, falling to a one-year low
against the dollar, as well as shedding gains against the euro
as UK elections seemed likely to result in no clear winner
[ID:nLDE64600H]. It shed 12 yen against the safe-haven Japanese
currency at one point .
 However, unlike the worst days of the 2008 credit crisis,
when money poured out of riskier assets like equity funds and
into money market funds, investors are not retreating
completely.
 ""Participants are unclear on where the market is going,""
said Scott Bennett, head of Asian credit at Aberdeen Asset
Management in Singapore. ""Views diverge, but they are all clear
that they don't want to be here now and so the market is
selling off.""
 By 0632 GMT, futures for STOXX Europe 50 ,
Germany's DAX  and France's CAC 40  were down 2.1
to 2.7 percent. Spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100
<.FTSE> to open as much as 130 points or 2.5 percent lower.
 Investors in Asia, however, appear to have realised they
may have overreacted to the U.S. carnage.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> skidded nearly 4 percent to a
two-month low in its worse day in slightly over a year, but it
pared losses on short-covering.
 Asian shares, which fell 2.4 percent, the biggest daily
drop in three months, also reclaimed some losses by
mid-afternoon. The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan was
down 1.9 percent <.MIAPJ0000PUS>.
 Greece's 110 billion ($140 billion) bailout has been a
plumb-line for markets since the start of the week. The MSCI
world share index <.MIWD00000US> has fallen 7 percent since
Monday, while the MSCI index for Asian shares excluding Japan
was down 8.25 percent.
 Investors are unconvinced Greece can achieve the austerity
measures it has pledged in return for a rescue and fear that
problems faced by other debt-ridden euro zone economies may
jeopardising the economic health of the whole bloc.
 Europe equity funds saw more than $2 billion in net
outflows in the week to May 5, the most in a year, as fears
grew of a euro zone sovereign debt crisis, EPFR Global said on
Friday.
 Money market funds had net outflows of $18 billion in the
week, indicating some investors were still putting cash to work
in fresh positions elsewhere, the fund tracker said.
 The euro , which fell to 14-month lows of $1.2510 on
Thursday, steadied in Asia just under $1.27 after the United
States said G7 finance ministers would discuss Greece's bailout
in a telephone call. [ID:nSGE64608F]
 Euro zone leaders also meet later in the day in a special
summit, while Germany's parliament is to vote on the Greek
bailout plan.
 The United States is due to report U.S. non-farm payrolls
and unemployment data for April, and while the numbers are
expected to be strong, pointing to an economic recovery,
analysts said any market reaction is likely to be muted by the
debt debacle. [ID:nN06259876]
 ""Traders are anticipating a better open to U.S. equities
after the strong rebound in the Australian dollar and the
Japanese yen and potentially strong data,"" said Robert Rennie
of Australia's Westpac Bank.
 ""If, and it is a very big if, the carnage in U.S. equity
was down to human error rather than Greek developments, we
could actually see a positive reaction to a good payroll
outcome.""
 The debt crisis is threatening to raise funding costs for
European governments and some companies as investors demand
bigger premiums for the higher risks or shun such bonds.
 Interbank rates, which banks charge each other for
short-term loans, rose on Thursday on fears that the euro debt
crisis will worsen and credit markets could seize up as they
did in the credit crunch in 2008, which helped throw economy
into recession.
 ""This brief rerun of the darkest days of 12-24 months ago
is a real confidence killer for leveraged investors, not to
mention the rest of us,"" said Rory Robertson, an interest rate
strategist at Macquarie in Sydney.
 ""The real worry is that the growing risk aversion via
growing problems in Europe is driving up funding costs across
the global financial system.""
 The dash for safety pushed gold  to near record highs
and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to five-month lows.
 The dollar index <.DXY> held near one-year highs at 84.9,
as the U.S. currency gained elsewhere from the super safe-haven
status of Treasuries.

 By Christina Fincher and Simon Falush
 LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - UK equity futures tumbled and
government bond futures soared on Friday after heavy falls in
global stocks overshadowed signs Britain's Conservatives would
emerge from an election as the largest party but fall short of
an overall majority.
 The prospect of the first hung parliament since 1974 left
uncertain the composition of the next government with markets
already approaching full-blown panic about the euro zone's debt
crisis spiralling out of control.
 ""The irony is that the UK election is taking a back seat to
contagion worries at the moment,"" said Andrew Roberts, head of
European rates strategy at RBS.
 ""We have seen a muted reaction in sterling. It seems that
markets are reacting more to the weakness in U.S. equities than
anything else.""
 By 0150 GMT, futures on Britain's FTSE 100 were down 3.2
percent, while financial bookmakers predicted the index would
open around 130 points or 2.5 percent lower.
 U.S. stocks plunged as much as 9 percent in late trade on
Thursday before clawing back some of the losses, while Japan's
benchmark Nikkei average fell 3.7 percent.
 The UK's blue-chip index has already slipped 5.3 percent
this week, on track for its biggest fall since March 2009.
 The June gilt future hit a contract high of 118.51 -- up 4
points for the week -- before paring gains to stand 62 ticks
higher on the day at 117.90.
 ""Given how U.S. Treasuries have performed it's not a
surprise that gilts have rallied,"" said Moyeen Islam, gilts
strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ""It's a much to do with the rally across all fixed income
markets as it is the election result.""
 Government bond and equity futures were open for a specially
extended trading session to allow investors to react to the
election results.
 The pound briefly bounced against the euro and dollar, but
failed to sustain those gains as traders waited for a clearer
picture of the make-up of the next British government to emerge.
 An outright win for the Conservative party, seen as the most
willing to sharply cut public spending to tackle Britain's
record deficit, would be welcomed by many investors.

 * Act now before money pours in, SIC says
 * Q2 GDP growth to ease to 10.7 pct; CPI to rise 4.2 pct
(Adds State Council researcher, paras 13-15)
 SHANGHAI/BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - China should widen the
yuan's daily trading band and return to the exchange-rate
mechanism that was in place prior to the global financial
crisis, a government think-tank said in a report published on
Friday.
 Beijing allowed the yuan to gradually rise 19 percent
against the dollar, following an initial 2.1 percent
revaluation in July 2005, before freezing it near 6.83 in July
2008 to provide stability during the worldwide credit crunch.
 ""In response to constantly growing pressure for renminbi
appreciation, we should consider appropriately expanding the
currency's floating band,"" said the State Information Centre
(SIC), a research outfit under the National Development and
Reform Commission, the powerful economic planning agency.
 The People's Bank of China now lets the yuan rise or fall
by 0.5 percent a day against the dollar from a midpoint it sets
each morning. In practice, the full width of the band has
rarely been used.
 In a report published in the official China Securities
Journal, the SIC recommended that moves in the yuan should be
gradual and ""controllable"" -- the long-standing formula used by
Chinese policymakers.
 ""With expectations of yuan appreciation gradually building
in the international community, it would be better to time the
widening of the yuan's band before more hot money rushes into
China,"" it said.
 The think-tank also said economic growth was likely to slow
moderately this quarter, while inflation would accelerate.
 Gross domestic product growth would ease to 10.7 percent,
compared with a year earlier, from 11.9 percent in the first
quarter, the SIC forecast.
 It expects consumer inflation to rise to 4.2 percent this
quarter, from 2.2 percent in the first three months, due to
rising import prices, a low base effect from 2009 and the
impact of bad weather.
 Private economists also expect inflation to rise and growth
to slow this quarter.
 Annual industrial output growth will slow this quarter to
around 15.6 percent from 19.6 percent in the first three
months, but would maintain relatively strong momentum.
 The spreading effect of sovereign debt risks in the West
and the likelihood that foreign currencies will weaken due to
loose monetary policy compound uncertainties in the
international trading environment, the report said.
 Separately, Ba Shusong, a senior researcher at the State
Council's Development Research Centre, said the government
should look at resuming yuan reform and scrapping export tax
rebates as the next steps in its gradual exit from pro-growth
policies adopted to weather the financial crisis.
 ""We think the yuan exchange rate will return to a floating
manageable regime, referring to a basket of currencies,"" Ba
said in an article published in the China Securities Journal.
 But he added China should proceed cautiously in its exit
and keep some supportive policies in place, because its export
recovery was still fragile and other parts of the world economy
were growing more slowly.

* Early exit polls point to hung parliament
 * Euro clobbered, holds just above 14-mth lows
 * Yen firm on rush to safe-haven assets
 SYDNEY, May 7 (Reuters) - Sterling was nursing huge losses
in Asia on Friday after a global rout from risk sent the U.S.
dollar and yen soaring, and pressured further by exit polls
suggesting no one party in the UK would hold a majority in
parliament.
 Initial polls suggested the Conservatives would hold the
most seats but perhaps not enough to govern outright.
[ID:nUKVOTES] [ID:nLDE64429K].
 Traders said it was not the time for political uncertainty
with investors running scared from euro zone debt troubles and
bailing out of any leveraged position to cover losses
elsewhere. Many believe political uncertainty could derail any
quick plans to put public finances in order and could prompt
credit agencies to downgrade UK from its AAA status.
 Sterling was around $1.4885 , having collapsed from
above $1.5140 overnight to as far as $1.4710 the lowest in over
a year. The pound was smashed by the safe-haven yen ,
shedding 12 yen at one stage to near 130.00 yen before bouncing
slightly to 135.75.
 ""On election night in Britain we are seeing European
sovereign debt problems playing a big part in the pound's
fall,"" said Joseph Capurso, currency strategist at Commonwealth
Bank. ""The Greek contagion is moving to markets in Spain and
Italy and that is definitely worrisome.""
 The early exit poll suggested the centre-right
Conservatives were likely to win 305 seats and Labour 255 seats
in the lower House of Commons, both short of the 326 needed for
a majority. It put the Liberal Democrats on 59 seats.
 Dealers said selling of euro/yen  and euro/Swiss
 led the way after the European Central Bank said it
would not buy government bonds to help Greece.
 The euro shed around 10 yen at one point  while
tumbling 2 percent to 1.4054 francs after the Swiss central
bank finally stopped intervening to buy the single currency.
 The euro was at $1.2648 , having fallen to a 14-month
low of $1.2520 on Thursday on fears the euro system could break
apart.
 Portuguese and Spanish 10-year bond spreads over German
Bunds widened to euro lifetime highs as market confidence about
the euro zone dived. The premium investors' demand to hold
Portuguese government debt over German Bunds hit a euro
lifetime high of 365 basis points while Spanish spread rose to
170 basis points.
 The Greek/German spread  climbed to around 950
basis points.
 The spike in risk aversion <.VXI> led to a broad sell-off
in stock and commodity markets. The S&P 500 <.SPX> dived 9
percent at one stage before ending with a 3.24 percent loss
[.N].
 The renewed rush to safety supported the dollar and the
yen. The dollar index <=USD><.DXY> was at 84.79, not far from a
one-year high of 85.27, struck earlier. The dollar could get a
boost later if U.S. jobs later in the day show 200,000 jobs
were added in April, up from 162,000 in March.[ID:nN03205134].
 The dollar pared some of its losses on the yen, inching up
to at 91.33 yen , from 90.17 yen late on Thursday when it
shed nearly 4 percent.

 WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - The White House expressed
strong support on Thursday for efforts to ""restore stability""
to Greece and said President Barack Obama had been briefed
about the issue and the situation in financial markets.
 ""Greece is enacting major economic reforms with the support
of the Euro-area and the IMF. This plan is designed to deliver
results over the next several years,"" White House spokesman
Robert Gibbs said in a statement.
 ""We strongly support this effort to help restore stability
to Greece and confidence to the global financial system, and we
will continue to communicate this to European officials.""
 Gibbs said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White
House economic adviser Larry Summers briefed Obama on Thursday
afternoon.
 U.S. stocks plunged 9 percent in the last two hours of
trading on Thursday before grabbing back some of the losses as
the escalating debt crisis in Europe exacerbated fears a new
credit crunch was looming.
 The Dow suffered its biggest-ever intraday point drop,
which may have been caused by an erroneous trade entered by a
person at a big Wall Street bank, according to several market
sources.
 The White House did not comment specifically on the Dow
drop. It said the administration was watching the Greek
situation carefully.
 ""Secretary Geithner and his staff are also in frequent
communication with our European counterparts,"" Gibbs said. ""The
Treasury Department is monitoring this very closely.""
 Greece's debt and deficit problems have triggered a wider
crisis threatening the entire 16-nation euro zone.
 Greek lawmakers approved a 30 billion euro ($40 billion)
austerity bill on Thursday that includes tax hikes, pension
reforms and deep cuts in public sector bonuses. Those reforms
will pave the way for a 110 billion euro bailout from euro zone
countries and the International Monetary Fund.
 Obama is briefed regularly about the situation in Greece,
Gibbs said. The U.S. president spoke with Greek Prime Minister
George Papandreou on Sunday.
 ""(Obama) welcomed the ambitious reform program announced by
the Greek authorities, as well as the significant support that
was agreed to by the IMF and Eurozone members,"" Gibbs said.
 ""The two leaders discussed the importance of implementation
going forward.""
 The White House also noted that Obama and Papandreou met in
Washington in March to discuss the economy and other issues.
 ""The prime minister outlined the steps the Greek government
was taking to address their fiscal challenges. They discussed
continued efforts by Europe and the United States together to
move forward on financial reform efforts globally,"" Gibbs
said.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - Latin American stocks slumped
more than 5 percent and the Brazilian real sank nearly 3
percent on Thursday as growing fears about Europe's debt crisis
caused global markets to sell off indiscriminately.
 The MSCI stock index for Latin America <.MILA00000PUS>
plunged as much as 9.3 percent in the worst moment of the day
but trimmed losses later amid talk that the panic selling was
triggered by an erroneous trade from a big Wall Street bank.
 Regardless of any possible trade glitch, global aversion to
risk grew further as investors worried the European Central
Bank was failing to stop Greece's debt crisis from spreading
along the euro zone.
 Emerging market risk spreads hit their widest levels in
three months as foreign investors sold the most liquid assets
in the region, including the currencies of Brazil and Mexico.
 ""A lot of people who had been in carry positions are
getting stopped out. At the moment everything with risk
associated with it is getting crushed,"" said Doug Smith, chief
economist for the Americas at Standard Chartered Bank in New
York.
 The Brazilian real  ended 2.86 percent weaker at
1.851 per U.S. dollar after slumping about 5 percent earlier in
the day. The Mexican peso  sank 1.95 percent to a
six-month low of 12.9855 per greenback.
 Latin American markets started the day under pressure after
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank's governing
council had finished its meeting in Lisbon without discussing a
possible purchase of European government debt.
 Many investors would like to see the ECB buy bonds issued
by weaker euro zone members such as Greece to support prices
and boost market confidence. For details, see [ID:nLDE6450H7].
 ""The market was expecting something clear from the ECB but
it did not get it,"" said Daniela Blancas, a currency strategist
at Scotia Capital in Mexico City.
 Although economic fundamentals continue to improve in Latin
America, Europe's debt problems have triggered a global
reduction in risk appetite.
 Yield spreads between emerging market bonds and U.S.
Treasuries, an important gauge of risk aversion, widened 28
basis points to 323 basis points, their widest since early
February, according to the JPMorgan EMBI+ index <11EMJ>.
 In stock markets, the Brazilian Bovespa index <.BVSP>
closed 2.31 percent lower and the Mexican IPC <.MXX> declined
1.86 percent.
 Argentina's MerVal <.MERV> slumped 5.41 percent as
investors aggressively sold riskier markets.

 By Al Yoon and Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged as much as
9 percent on Thursday as losses caused by Europe's debt crisis
turned into a stampede of automated selling, pushing the euro
to an almost 14 month-low and gold to near record highs.
 U.S. regulators investigated whether erroneous orders
caused a 10-minute nose-dive that dragged the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> into its biggest ever intraday drop
in terms of points, a fall of 998.5 points at its low point.
 Nearly $1 trillion was wiped off U.S. equity values before
prices clawed back much of their losses.
 ""I've seen a lot in my career. This ranks up as one of the
top 10 in terms of energy, fear and focus,"" said Peter Kenny,
managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New
Jersey, a Wall Street veteran.
 Traders in Asia were shaken from their beds and told to
start trading. The Wall Street rout came after the close of
European stock markets and during the night in Asia.
 Investors drove up the price of government debt in a rush
to safety and gold jumped more than 3 percent to top $1,200 an
ounce in the biggest one-day gain in more than a year.
 The VIX <.VIX>, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, soared
31.7 percent in its largest percentage jump since September
2008 -- just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers ushered in
the darkest days of the biggest financial crisis since the
Great Depression.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Speculation about what caused the slump was rampant.
 Nasdaq launched a probe into possible erronous trades and
said it would cancel all trades showing a rise or fall of more
than 60 percent during the 20 minutes prior to 3 p.m. local
(1900 GMT).
 ""The rumor, which was the same thing that everyone else had
heard, was that there was a multi-billion order that was
erroneously sent into the stock market,"" said Steve Leuer, a
stock index futures trader in Chicago.
 The Dow, already down on concerns that Greece's debt crisis
could spread to other euro zone countries, lost 651 points in
under 10 minutes starting around 2:40 pm and then recovered all
of that plunge within half an hour.
 The index closed down 347.80 points, or 3.20 percent, at
10,520.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 37.75
points, or 3.24 percent, to 1,128.15. The Nasdaq Composite
Index <.IXIC> lost 82.65 points, or 3.44 percent, to 2,319.64.
 After the close on Thursday, S&P 500 stock index futures
were down 5.9 points, pointing to a possible further drop at
the open of the U.S. stock market on Friday.
 Fears of a looming new credit crunch have grown in recent
days on the back of Europe's escalating debt crisis. But some
said speculative bubbles had built in the equity, metals and
energy markets and were the real catalyst behind the sell-off.
 ""The stock markets have retraced more than 80 percent from
their lows, copper has nearly tripled and crude oil is up
nearly 250 percent,"" said Troy Buckner, managing principal of
hedge fund NuWave Investment Management LLC of Morristown, New
Jersey. ""Multiple sectors were exposed to these excesses.""
 The sell-off was broad and deep, with all 10 of the S&P 500
sectors falling 2 to 4 percent. The financial sector was the
worst hit, sliding 4.1 percent <.GSPF>.
 U.S. Treasury prices soared in a safe-haven stampede.
 Ten-year notes  last traded up 1-7/32 at 102
after hitting a session high of 103. The 10-year yield was last
3.40 percent after trading down to 3.27 percent, a five-month
intraday low.
 Investors rushed to the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar
and Japanese yen as the European Central Bank on Thursday
offered no new measures to ease the Greek debt crisis.
 After dropping to $1.2523, the euro was last down 1.5
percent at $1.2622 , its lowest since March 2009.
 ""This is a full capitulation sell-off we've seen in the
last couple of hours,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""The sovereign credit worries in Europe started the ball
rolling and now it's a complete panic,"" he said as the market
roit
 The euro, which hit 110.65 yen earlier -- its lowest level
since 2001 -- was on track for its biggest daily loss against
the yen since October 2008, according to Reuters data.
 Among major currencies, the U.S. dollar was only weaker
against the yen, dropping more than 4 percent to as low as
88.03 yen , according to Reuters.
 Selling increased as Greek lawmakers approved a 30-billion
euro austerity bill that paved the way for a bailout by the
European Union and International Monetary Fund.
 Investors fretted over the effect of the crisis on the more
vulnerable members of the euro zone.
 ""Many expect that Portugal and maybe Spain will follow in
Greece's footsteps and need a bailout from the European Union,""
said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 Little was spared during the sell-off. Emerging markets
were hard hit, but stocks prices in Latin America fell less
than Wall Street for the most part.
 The Bovespa index <.BVSP> in Sao Paulo slid 2.3 percent and
the Brazilian real  fell 5 percent at one point in its
biggest one-day plunge since October 2008. The real later pared

 WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - The United States has set
preliminary anti-dumping duties on hundreds of millions of
dollars' worth of copper pipe from China and Mexico, the U.S.
Commerce Department said on Thursday.
 The industrial pipe joins a long list of Chinese goods that
have been hit with U.S. duties in recent years to offset unfair
pricing practices or government subsidies.
 The new dispute comes as the United States is accusing
China of giving Chinese manufacturers an unfair trade advantage
by keeping its yuan currency at an artificially low value
versus the dollar. 
 The duties ranged from 10.26 to 60.50 percent on the
Chinese pipe and from 29.52 to 32.27 percent on the Mexican
pipe, the Commerce Department said.
 The decision is a victory for U.S. companies Cerro Flow
Products Inc, Kobe Wieland Copper Product LLC and Mueller
Copper Tube Products Inc, which filed a petition last year
asking for import relief.
 The United States imported $130.3 million worth of the
copper pipe from Mexico and $233.0 million from China in 2009.
 China has accused the United States of misusing its trade
remedy laws in a protectionist manner.
 Washington says its duties are justified to protect
vulnerable U.S. companies against unfair trade practices.
 The Commerce Department will announce final anti-dumping
duties on the two countries in September.
 The U.S. International Trade Commission could strike down
the duties if it decides U.S. producers have not been harmed or
threatened by the lower-priced imports.
 That vote is scheduled for November.

 Investors rushed to the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar
and Japanese yen as the European Central Bank offered no new
measures to ease a Greek debt crisis after a meeting earlier on
Thursday.
 Declines in the single currency accelerated after stocks on
Wall Street tumbled as much as 9 percent in volatile afternoon
trading in New York -- briefly erasing most of this year's
gains.
 After dropping to $1.2523, the euro was last down 1.5
percent at $1.2615, its lowest since March 2009.
 ""This is a full capitulation sell-off we've seen in the
last couple of hours,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist, at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""The sovereign credit worries in Europe started the ball
rolling and now it's a complete panic,"" he said.
 Confidence in the euro zone has been plummeting as Greece
struggles to introduce cuts to public spending in the face of
violent protests in Athens.
 ""Nothing short of a sensational announcement can help the
euro at this point. And that certainly did not come from (ECB
President Jean-Claude) Trichet,"" said Kathy Lien, a director
for currency research at GFT in New York.
 As expected, the ECB left interest rates at a record low of
1 percent on Thursday. Trichet said the bank had not considered
buying government debt to stop the euro's rout, as some had
speculated, and a Greek default was ""out of the question.""
 Germany's parliament was due to vote on approving its share
of a 110 billion euro EU/IMF Greek rescue package on Friday,
while fears of contagion to other heavily indebted euro zone
countries persisted, driving a safe-haven bid for the dollar
and U.S. Treasury debt.
 ""Just like in 2008 when Lehman (Brothers) collapsed,
sentiment has clearly overwhelmed everything else -- data,
everything,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist,
RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.
 The euro has slumped about 5 percent against the dollar
this week and is down almost 12 percent year to date.
 CONTAGION FEARS
 The single euro zone currency, which hit 110.65 yen earlier
-- its lowest level since 2001 -- was on track for its biggest
daily loss against the yen since October 2008, according to
Reuters data. It was last down 5.2 percent at 114.09 yen
EURJPY=>.
 ""The forex market is concerned about one thing and one
thing only and that is 'contagion,'"" said analyst Dennis
Gartman, from the Gartman Letter.
 Among major currencies, the dollar was only weaker against
the yen as Japan's currency also tends to benefit in times of
risk aversion.
 The dollar dropped more than 4 percent to as low as 88.03
yen, according to Reuters data. The level was the lowest for
the dollar since December 2009 and the worst single-day decline
since October 1998.
 The euro also hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc
at 1.4004 francs, shedding 2.2 percent. Traders said the Swiss
National Bank, which has been intervening in the market in
recent months to prevent excessive franc strength, earlier
stopped defending levels above $1.43.
 Sterling also posted its biggest one-day drop since last
October to $1.4715 as markets awaited the outcome of
closely-contested British elections.
 EURO FALLING TOWARD DOLLAR PARITY?
 As Greece struggles to consolidate its budget, fears have
grown over the effect of the crisis on the more vulnerable
members of the euro zone.
 ""Many expect that Portugal and maybe Spain will follow in
Greece's footsteps and need a bailout from the European Union,""
said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 Currency strategists at BNP Paribas said on Thursday the
euro will fall to parity against the U.S. dollar by the first
quarter of 2011.
 BNP said over the past year the net inflow into European
sovereign debt markets has ""collapsed."" Official accounts,
which had been steady euro buyers and bond investors for years,
have ""disappeared.""

 MEXICO CITY, May 6 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso sank to a
six-month low on Thursday after the European Central Bank
offered no new measures to ease the Greek debt crisis and fears
mounted of contagion spreading to other euro zone states.
 A stock trading error at a major global firm was blamed for
exacerbating the already steep losses in global markets. For

 The peso   lost 1.95 percent to 12.9855 per
U.S. dollar while the IPC stock index <.MXX> closed down 1.86
percent at 31,398.97.
 ""It looks tragic,"" said Alonso Madero, who manages 64
billion pesos at Actinver in Mexico City.
 Confidence in the euro zone has been plummeting as Greece
struggles to introduce cuts to public spending in the face of
violent protests in Athens. Investors fear that that debt
crisis could spread to other vulnerable euro zone states.
 Following an ECB meeting where policy makers left interest
rates at a record low of 1 percent, bank chief Jean-Claude
Trichet said the ECB did not discuss buying government debt to
stop the euro's rout, as some had speculated it would.
 ""This was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" Madero
said. ""The market interpreted this as 'these guys are not doing
their job.' They are not sending a clear signal that they will
do whatever it takes to avoid collapse.""
 The peso has lost more than 6 percent since last week when
a rating agency debt downgrade of Greece, Portugal and Spain
spooked investors.
 Global markets bounced back after a wave of panic on
Thursday spiked the peso to 13.35 per U.S. dollar, its weakest
since November, 2009. The IPC briefly fell more than 4 percent.
Rumors swirled that a trading error spurred sharp drops in U.S.
stocks, which reverberated through other markets.
 ""This was scary, there was no apparent reason,"" said a
trader in Mexico City.
 Sharp losses in the Mexican currency pushed foreign
investors holding peso bonds to dump positions, traders said.
 The yield on the government's benchmark 10-year peso bond
 bid up 12 basis points to 7.66 percent and its
price fell nearly a point.
 Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens said the
peso's sharp drop was not worrisome because it was cleaning out
speculative positions and would leave the local market more
stable. [ID:nN06102081]

 * Administration wants fair competition for U.S. firms
 By Patricia Zengerle
 WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - The United States does not
see China's growing influence in Latin America as a threat to
Washington's role in the region or the competitiveness of U.S.
companies there, Daniel Restrepo, President Barack Obama's top
Latin American adviser, said on Thursday.
 China's economic influence was practically nonexistent
in Latin America a decade ago, when the United States and its
political and trade relations dominated the Americas.
 But the Asian giant is now the leading trading partner of
countries such as Brazil and Peru, while Washington has
squabbled over free trade deals with Colombia and Panama and
pursued few new trade initiatives in the region in recent
years.
 That has raised concern that Washington risks losing a
valuable market, particularly as it seeks to overcome the
effects of the recession. But Restrepo told the Reuters Latin
American investment summit that Washington did not anticipate a
diminished role in the region as China's grows.
 ""Particularly given the geography and the
interconnectedness in the Americas, it's not a competition that
we fear,"" the administration official, senior director for
Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council,
said.
 ""We firmly believe in the competitiveness of U.S. companies
and U.S. industry,"" he said.
 ""We obviously want to ensure ... that the competition that
companies have with companies from the region and companies
from without the region, that that competition be a fair one,
be a transparent one, be one where they have an equal chance to
compete,"" Restrepo added.
 But the overall U.S. stance is that the United States
welcomes increased global engagement that brings economic
development, he said.
 ""A more stable, more prosperous, more secure Americas is a
more effective partner on a whole host of levels for the United
States, their most natural partner,"" Restrepo said.

 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a 14-month

 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged on Thursday
afternoon, with the Nasdaq at one point falling more than 9

year, and the euro tumbled as fears of a spreading debt crisis
in Europe mounted.
 The European Central Bank disappointed investors by failing
to announce fresh measures to help stem the Greek debt crisis.

did not discuss the outright purchase of European sovereign

 * Would deal with specific African concerns
 * Trade finance remains a constraint in Africa
 
 By Matthew Tostevin
 DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Reuters) - African states have floated
the idea of a separate trade deal package to address their
concerns while big countries wrangle over full global agreement,
the head of the World Trade Organisation said.
 Africa wants a faster resolution to long-running global
trade talks, held up by discussions among powers such as the
United States, European Union, China and India over obstacles of
less relevance on the world's poorest continent.
 ""There is not only a sort of frustration, but there is also
an operational option which African countries floated the day
before yesterday in the General Council in Geneva,"" Lamy told
reporters at the World Economic Forum on Africa on Thursday.
 ""They haven't yet tabled a detailed proposal but my feeling
is that that is coming,"" he said in Tanzania.
 Such a proposal could meet scepticism in the United States
and Europe, however, as rich countries would be reluctant to
hand over something in advance and then not get credit when they
push for a final deal.
 Lamy said he expected such a proposal would address
duty-free, quota-free access for goods from least developed
countries with a similar deal on services and a possible deal on
trade facilitation -- making cross border trade easier and
cheaper.
 It could also be expected to address one of the key demands
of some African states for an end to cotton subsidies, which
depress prices for poor farmers.
 But it would not deal with tariffs on electrical goods or
drugs, which matter to more industrialised economies.
 ""It is just a modification in the sequence of negotiations,""
he said. ""Whether this will work or not is not for me to say,
but my sense is that their growing impatience will probably lead
them to take this sort of initiative.""
 Lamy said that as global trade was rebounding -- the WTO
forecasts 9.5 percent growth this year after a 12.2 percent
contraction in 2009 -- African trade was also increasing with
the rest of the world and within the continent.
 But he said access to trade financing after the global
financial crisis had not returned so quickly in Africa.
 ""The market has seriously improved since last year but there
still remain issues with liquidity availability and price in
Africa,"" he said. ""It certainly remains a constraint. More than
on other continents.""

 * China not interested in dictating policies
 
 By David Clarke
 DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Reuters) - China's interest in
investing in Africa makes sense for both partners and should
transform economies long reliant on commodity exports,
Ethiopia's prime minister said on Thursday.
 China pledged last year to give Africa $10 billion in
concessional loans over the next three years and it is ploughing
money into developing infrastructure in many nations on the
world's poorest continent.
 Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said it made sense for China to
spend in Africa, partly because its massive foreign exchange
reserves are largely denominated in dollars and it needs to
diversify those assets.
 Rising labour costs in China also meant that the Asian giant
would want to start relocating some manufacturing industries to
countries where wage bills may not be as high.
 Meles said that at the same time, African nations needed to
shift towards industrialisation and boost skills after a decade
of growth that has done little to transform economies driven by
exports of natural resources and agricultural commodities.
 ""At the moment, this is consistent with China's interests,""
Meles told the World Economic Forum on Africa in Tanzania.
 ""It's in their interest to spend tens of billions of dollars
in Africa and it's in our interest to have access to those tens
of billions of dollars,"" he said.
 
 WEST CRITICAL OF CHINESE MOTIVES
 Some Western nations say China is interested only in
extracting Africa's natural resources to feed its fast-growing
economy, cares little for African development and supports
governments with dubious human rights records.
 Some Chinese commentators say the West still treats Africa
like a colony, whereas Beijing's interest is based on mutual
economic development.
 Liu Guijin, special representative for African Affairs at
the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry, said his country was not
interested in promoting its policies or ideology in Africa at
the expense of Western views.
 ""In China, we have a saying: in order to be rich, build more
roads. And that is exactly what China is doing here, in Africa,
in a lot of countries,"" he said.
 He said he was happy there had been a lot of development in
African countries in recent years, but the development policies
pursued by African governments were not China's business.
 ""It is up to the African countries, African governments,
African peoples who are making decisions on their own models of
development,"" he said.

(Updates prices, adds detail, adds comment)
 By Samantha Pearson
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a 14-month
low against the dollar on Thursday after the European Central
Bank failed to offer new measures to ease a Greek debt crisis,
which investors fear could spread across Europe.
 After dropping to $1.2655, the euro was down 0.7 percent at
$1.2715, hovering around its lowest since March 2009.
 Confidence in the euro zone has been plummeting as Greece
struggles to introduce cuts to public spending in the face of
violent protests in Athens.
 ""Nothing short of a sensational announcement can help the
euro at this point. And that certainly did not come from (ECB
President Jean-Claude) Trichet,"" said Kathy Lien, a director
for currency research at GFT Forex, in New York.
 As expected, the ECB left interest rates at a record low of
1 percent on Thursday. Trichet said the bank had not considered
buying government debt to stop the euro's rout, as some had
speculated, and a Greek default was ""out of the question.""
 Germany's parliament was due to vote on approving its share
of a 110-billion-euro EU/IMF Greek rescue package on Friday,
but fears of contagion to other heavily indebted euro zone
countries, including Spain and Portugal, persisted, driving a
safe-haven bid for the dollar and U.S. Treasury debt.
 The euro is down 4.8 percent against the dollar so far this
week and is off more than 11 percent year to date.
 Among major currencies, the dollar was only weaker against
the yen, dropping 1.5 percent to 92.45 yen. The Japanese
currency also tends to benefit in times of risk aversion.
 The euro hit a 15-month low of 116.59 yen and was on track
for its biggest daily decline against the Japanese currency
since February. It was last down 2.2 percent at 117.65 yen.
 The euro also hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc
beneath 1.41 francs, shedding 1.6 percent. Traders said the
Swiss National Bank, which has been intervening in the
market in recent months to prevent excessive franc strength,
earlier stopped defending levels above $1.43.
 Sterling fell 1.2 percent to $1.4915 as markets awaited the
outcome of a closely-contested parliamentary election.
 CONTAGION FEARS
 As Greece struggles to consolidate its budget, fears have
grown over the effect of the crisis on the more vulnerable
members of the euro zone.
 ""Many expect that Portugal and maybe Spain will follow in
Greece's footsteps and need a bailout from the European Union,""
said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 Investors were hoping for reassurance from the ECB but
analysts said the bank's latest comments indicated it was more
concerned with recent improvements in the euro zone economy.
 The euro earlier trimmed some losses after Spain managed to
sell five-year government debt, albeit at a higher yield than
at its last sale in March, which quelled some market concerns
that Madrid's credit risks may be rising quickly.
 ""The auction results suggested a feeling that the
contagion, at least for Spain, may not be that strong,"" said
Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.

 * 1.4 million jobs would come from reducing trade barriers
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's plan
to create 2 million new jobs by doubling exports over the next
five years relies heavily on passing and negotiating new free
trade agreements, a top U.S. official said.
 Commerce Under Secretary for International Trade Francisco
Sanchez, in an interview at the Reuters Latin American
Investment Summit, also defended past U.S. trade deals
unpopular with many Democrats who control Congress.
 The Obama administration estimates it can create about
600,000 trade-related jobs by getting the U.S. government,
including the president himself, more involved in advocating
for U.S. exports, Sanchez said on Wednesday.
 When an American company is bidding for a foreign contract
worth more than $4 billion or $5 billion, the plan is for Obama
to bring it up and try to help close the sale in meetings with
the purchasing country's leader, Sanchez said.
 Cabinet officials and ambassadors have also been told they
will be judged on how effective they are in opening doors for
U.S. companies to make sales abroad, he said.
 But even with that increased advocacy, the Obama
administration expects the remaining 1.4 million new
trade-related jobs to come from reducing foreign trade
barriers, and that means ""going after free trade agreements,
including the three that are pending,"" Sanchez said.
 Obama inherited three trade agreements with Colombia,
Panama and South Korea from his predecessor, George W. Bush,
who was unable to persuade the Democratic-controlled Congress
to approve the pacts.
 Sanchez said U.S. trade officials were working to resolve
Democratic Party concerns about all three pacts.
 Those include anti-labor violence and impunity concerns in
Colombia, labor issues and bank secrecy laws in Panama and auto
and beef market barriers in South Korea.
 Colombian Finance Minister Oscar Zuluaga told the Reuters
Summit on Tuesday it would be a shame if the U.S. Congress does
not approve the trade deal before Uribe leaves in August.
 ""There is no reason for it. The delay is surprising,
considering that Colombia is a principal ally of the United
States,"" Zuluaga said.
 Sanchez, who has worked extensively in Colombia over the
past 15 years, said it would be challenging to win approval of
the trade deal by then, but Obama knew the importance of
enacting all three pending agreements.
 He said U.S. trade with Chile more than doubled between
2004 and 2008 after a free trade pact went into force, and that
U.S. exports to the Dominican Republic and Central American
countries also have increased significantly since Congress
approved that controversial free trade deal in 2005.
 Altogether, the United States does 44 percent of its trade
with its 17 free trade partners that together represent just 10
percent of global trade, Sanchez said.
 ""So, you tell me, how do 44 percent of our global trade
with countries that represent just 10 percent of global trade?
Well, it's because we've lowered barriers,"" Sanchez said.

 * Economists say SNB trying to find way out of interventions
 * Interventions add franc liquidity, create inflation risks
 * Swiss start worrying about risk of euro holdings
 
 By Sven Egenter
 ZURICH, May 6 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank allowed
the Swiss franc to rise to a fresh record high against the euro
on Thursday, a sign the central bank is moving away from massive
currency interventions that could generate inflation.
 The billions of francs that the SNB has been pumping into
the currency market to buy euros have been adding liquidity at a
time when the Alpine economy is on course for a strong recovery
and the need for higher interest rates is increasing.
 ""The pressure has been mounting because the monetary base is
rising sharply and this may lead to inflationary pressures,"" UBS
analyst Beat Siegenthaler said. ""They may have decided to
tolerate a slightly higher franc.""
 After over a month of near-total stability against the euro
at the 1.4325 level, the franc shot up suddenly on Thursday,
hitting a new record just above 1.41 per euro. 
 ""It looks like the SNB just pulled their bid,"" said a
trader.
 Observing its usual policy, the central bank declined to
comment on the market move.
 Credit Suisse analyst Fabian Heller said an abrupt end to
all interventions was unlikely: ""The SNB may let the market take
over gradually.""
 However, the central bank has to phase out its
interventions, the last of the emergency measures it adopted to
fight the global financial crisis, before it tackles the
mid-term inflation threat with higher interest rates, he said.
 Most analysts expect a first interest rate increase later
this year, though the euro zone debt crisis could conceivably
persuade the central bank to stay on hold. <0#FES:>
 Moderate inflation of 1.4 percent in April is giving the SNB
leeway to keep interest rates low for now. [ID:nLDE6450IH]
 But the SNB forecasts a breach of its 2-percent price
stability threshold in 2012, and its warnings that deflation
might return look increasingly out of place as indicators
suggest a strong economic recovery.
 Many analysts had expected an eventual rise in the franc,
with the median forecast in a Reuters poll published on
Wednesday for the franc at 1.4220 per euro in three months.
Predictions ranged from 1.3820 to 1.4800. [ID:nRPO1WMsjn]
 A Credit Suisse currency analyst said on Thursday, after the
franc's jump, that the bank had a three-month forecast of 1.41
and a 12-month prediction of 1.40.
 There are now no clear signs of a technical bottom for
euro/franc and it may dip below 1.40 at some stage, although the
forecasts remain valid, the analyst said.
 Siegenthaler said UBS was currently looking at its currency
forecasts; it had euro/franc at 1.40 over a three-month horizon
""and the new forecast will likely be a bit lower"".
 
 SPECULATION
 The SNB launched the interventions in March 2009 as part of
drastic steps to stave off the threat of deflation at a time
when interest rates were practically zero.
 After allowing the franc to rise moderately against the euro
at the beginning of this year, the SNB began intervening
regularly several weeks ago as the euro came under growing
downward pressure globally because of Greece's debt troubles.
 SNB chairman Philipp Hildebrand said last week that the euro
zone crisis could prompt investors to pile more money into the
franc, a traditional safe haven, driving the currency higher and
raising the risks of deflation pressures. [ID:nLAG006272]
 Hildebrand said the central bank was therefore acting
decisively to prevent too sharp a rise in the franc.
 The SNB has not actively sterilised its interventions.
Hildebrand voiced confidence that the central bank would
eventually be able to absorb excess liquidity quickly by issuing
bills or using reverse repos in the money market.
 But Siegenthaler said issuing bills in large amounts would
risk creating easy opportunities for speculative position-taking
by generating a place for traders to park their francs. This
would be counterproductive by undermining the SNB's overriding
objective of curbing speculative flows, he said.
 
 RISK
 Analysts said the SNB was also facing more public opposition
to continued intervention -- not a decisive factor in its
decisions, but possibly a contributing one.
 SNB statistics show the central bank's currency reserves
more than doubled since the start of the interventions, and its
euro holdings more than tripled to 56.4 billion euros at the end
of the first quarter.
 The influential NZZ am Sonntag newspaper quoted unnamed
sources as saying the central bank's efforts to keep the franc
stable had added another 14 billion euros in April alone.
 The newspaper also said the euro was becoming a significant
financial risk for the central bank, which could lead to higher
provisions and lower profits available to the Swiss government.
 ""If the whole situation should get worse and the euro ceases
to be what it is now, then these holdings should fall in value
considerably, and that wouldn't look good for the central bank,""
ZKB analyst David Marmet said.

(Adds quotes from conference call, share price, details; in

 TORONTO, May 6 (Reuters) - Shares of Magna International
Inc   surged 21 percent on Thursday, after it
said it inked an agreement with founder Frank Stronach to
eliminate the auto parts maker's dual class structure.
 The company also said it swung to a profit in the latest
quarter, beating estimates on the back of a pickup in global
vehicle production rates and cost cuts, which allowed it to
reinstate its quarterly dividend.
 Shares of Magna were up C$13.43 at C$77.70 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange on Thursday morning.
 The Aurora, Ontario-based company said the agreement with
its colorful founder, if approved in court and by shareholders,
would see the elimination of Magna's Class B Shares -- through
which Stronach controls the company.
 The Stronach Trust, which has about 66 percent of Magna's
voting rights through 726,829 outstanding Class B shares it
indirectly owns, would indirectly get 9 million newly issued
Class A Shares, or about 7.5 percent of Magna, and $300 million
in cash.
 Based on Magna's closing price of $62.53 Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange, the deal would be valued at $863
million.
 Each Class B share currently carries 300 votes. The new
structure would mean one share, one vote.
 ""Our proposed new share structure will unlock value for all
shareholders,"" Vincent Galifi, chief financial officer at
Magna, said in a call with analysts.
 Galifi said the deal, which could be completed by the end
of Magna's second quarter, should enhance the liquidity and
marketability of shares as the simplified capital structure
would be more consistent with its key competitors.
 The deal also includes the establishment of a joint venture
with the Stronach Trust to make electric and hybrid vehicles,
with Stronach at the helm.
 ""(Stronach) feels Magna is part of his blood,"" said Don
Walker, Magna's co-chief executive. ""On a go-forward basis, he
is a very big believer in the future of electric vehicles.""
 Magna would invest $220 million for a 73 percent interest
in the joint venture. The Stronach group would invest $80
million for the rest of the stake but would have effective
control with the right to appoint three of five board members.
 QUARTERLY PROFIT TOPS ESTIMATES
 Magna said it earned $223 million, or $1.97 a share, in the
first quarter ended March 31. That compares with a loss of $200
million, or $1.79 a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding a gain of 12 cents a share on the sale of an
electronics systems facility in China, it earned $1.85 a share,
comfortably ahead of analyst expectations of 80 cents,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
 Revenue was up 54 percent at $5.51 billion, compared with
estimates of $5.14 billion.
 Magna reinstated its quarterly dividend at $0.18 per
share.
 The company said the recovery in the North American auto
industry was continuing, thanks to improved sales over the past
few months, combined with low levels of dealer inventories.
 North American light vehicle production rose 67 percent in
the quarter, while in Western Europe production rose 33
percent.
 The company said complete vehicle assembly sales rose 11
percent in the quarter to $446 million.

NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a 14-month
low against the dollar on Thursday after the European Central
Bank failed to offer any additional measures to ease the Greek
debt crisis, which investors fear could spread across the
region.
Confidence in the euro zone has been plummeting as markets
remain skeptical that Athens will be able to consolidate its
budget in the face of violent protests across the capital.
""Many expect that Portugal and maybe Spain will follow
Greece's footsteps and need a bailout from the European Union,""
said John Doyle, foreign exchange strategist at Tempus
Consulting in Washington.
 As expected, the ECB left interest rates at a record low of
1 percent on Thursday. However, the central bank said it had
not considered buying government debt to stop the euro's rout,
as some had speculated.
 After dropping to $1.2690 on electronic trading platform
EBS, the euro was later down 0.6 percent against the dollar at
$1.2736, hovering around its lowest level since March 2009.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said a
default for Greece was ""out of the question"" but also said
officials did not discuss the possibility of buying government
bonds to lower borrowing costs for indebted euro zone
countries.
 Mike Malpede, senior strategist at Easy Forex in Chicago,
said: ""Trichet is being very cautions in his commentary. We
haven't seen him propose any additional measures as yet to try
to combat from the fallout from the Greek debt crisis.
 ""That seems to be a little bit of a disappointment to the
trade in the euro.""
 The euro also hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc
beneath 1.41 francs , shedding 1.7 percent. Traders
said the Swiss National Bank, which has been intervening in the
market in recent months to prevent excessive franc strength,
earlier stopped defending levels around above $1.43.

 (Adds background, quote, details, byline)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 6 (Reuters) - Japan is stepping up pressure
against the United States in a dispute about the way the U.S.
sets duties on imports it views as unfairly priced, by reviving
a request for sanctions at the World Trade Organisation.
 The Japanese move is a further blow against the
controversial U.S. method of setting duties on goods that are
dumped -- sold for less than they cost at home -- in a way that
critics says inflates the tariffs, a practice which has been
repeatedly condemned by WTO judges.
 The United States is the only one of the WTO's 153 members
to use zeroing, and U.S. officials have acknowledged that they
will have to modify their practice to comply with WTO rules.
 But with U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk emphasising the
importance of enforcing trade deals and fair trade in America's
commerce policy, President Barack Obama's administration will
not want to appear to weaken its armoury against unfair imports.
 The United States is already facing a demand for over $300
million in sanctions from the European Union in another dispute
over zeroing lost by Washington.
 In a document posted on the WTO website on Thursday, Japan
said it was requesting a WTO arbitrator to resume arbitration in
the case now that the WTO had ruled definitively that the United
States was breaking international trade rules.
 Japan is seeking $248 million in annual retaliation against
the United States in the case which originally involved
anti-dumping duties on imports of Japanese ball bearings.
 Both Japan and the United States agreed to suspend
arbitration in the case in 2008, soon after it was set up, to
allow the WTO to decide definitively on whether the United
States had complied with earlier rulings in the case which was
launched in 2004.
 In August 2009, the WTO adopted a compliance ruling after
the United States lost an appeal, clearing the way for Japan to
resume the sanctions process.
 
 NOT JUST BALL BEARINGS
 ""Now we're ready so we started it again,"" a Japanese trade
diplomat told Reuters.
 Japan has said it may target goods other than ball bearings
in its retaliation.
 WTO guidelines say arbitration should take up to 60 days,
but in practice it can last several months while WTO experts
calculate retaliation equivalent to the damage suffered by the
complainant.
 WTO rules allow members to impose duties on imported goods
that are dumped. Calculating such anti-dumping duties often
involves comparisons of goods. 
 Zeroing ignores cases where the imports actually cost more
than they do at home, unfairly inflating the duty by
exaggerating the gap, according to critics.
 Japan is spearheading efforts at the WTO to have zeroing
banned altogether.
 U.S. Commerce Under-Secretary for International Trade
Francisco Sanchez said last month the administration was trying
to find a way to comply with the WTO rulings without damaging
its ability to curb unfairly priced imports.
 U.S. law firm Miller and Chevalier said this could lead to
""seismic changes"" in the U.S. trade remedy regime.

 By Manuela D'Alessandro
 MILAN, May 6 (Reuters) - The closely watched fraud trial of
four foreign banks was put back to May 19 on Thursday so one of
Italy's best-known judges can take the case.
 The trial is seen as a test case for hundreds of cities
facing heavy losses from derivatives deals with leading banks.
 The trial is being reassigned to Oscar Magi, who oversaw the
trial of Google Inc executives convicted in February for
Internet privacy violations.
 He also sentenced 23 Americans in absentia to prison last
year for the 2003 Central Intelligence Agency kidnapping of a
terrorism suspect in Milan.
 UBS AG, Deutsche Bank, Germany's Depfa and JPMorgan Chase &
Co face aggravated fraud charges over an interest rate swap on a
1.68 billion euro ($2.25 billion) bond issued byu Milan, the
biggest issued by an Italian city.
 Eleven bank employees and two former Milan city employees
face the same charges arising from a 30-year bond issued in 2005
by Milan, Italy's fashion and financial capital.
 Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo told reporters that the Milan
case could have a ""domino effect"" on interest rate swaps signed
by other local goverments throughout Italy.
 ""The important thing that has emerged is that the banks
derived greater profit than that declared to the market. Italy
was carpeted with this type of contracts,"" he said.
 Those charged are accused of lying about the swap and
falsely representing the deal as a way to reduce Milan's debt.
The banks have denied wrong-doing.
 Aggravated fraud involves fraud against public entities.
 Fabio Amatucci, an expert on local government finances at
Milan's Bocconi University, estimated potential losses from
derivatives for local authorities at 3.5 billion euros to 4
billion euros.

 * Merkel, Sarkozy say more competition in ratings needed
 * S&P says has duty to tell investors how it sees things
 * Ratings users says policymakers taking aim at wrong target

 (Adds ratings user reaction)
 By James Mackenzie and Huw Jones
 PARIS/LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas
Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel took aim at major
ratings agencies on Thursday, saying the European Union should
look carefully at whether they had worsened the Greek debt
crisis.
 ""The decision by a ratings agency to downgrade the rating of
Greece even before the programme of the authorities and the
amount of the support plan were known prompts us to consider the
role of the ratings agencies in the spreading of crises,"" the
leaders wrote in a joint letter to European Council president
Herman Van Rompuy.
 The remarks are the latest in a series of criticisms aimed
at the big ratings agencies -- Moody's, Standard and Poor's and
Fitch -- for their role in the financial crisis.
 Merkel and Sarkozy said a review of the sector should be
launched and proposals should be considered to ""reinforce
competition in the market for rating credit.""
 They also said the European Commission should conduct a
""critical review of the sense of using agency ratings in
European regulations.""
 In particular, the role of ratings in determining how much
capital a bank must set aside to cover risks, should also be
reduced, the letter said.
 
 WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR
 Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency singled out for
downgrading Greek debt as the rescue package was being put
together, rejected the criticism, saying its duty was to tell
investors how it sees things, without fear or favour.
 ""S&P's rating of Greece in recent months has been
consistently more positive than that of the market - and that
remains the case today, even after our recent downgrade,"" a
spokesman for S&P said.
 ""We have repeatedly pointed out that a bailout, while
addressing Greece's near-term liquidity problems, does not
necessarily resolve its longer term solvency issues,"" the
spokesman said.
 Moody's and Fitch had no immediate comment.
 There have been repeated calls from European policymakers in
recent years for a home-grown agency to compete in the U.S.
dominated sector but with little progress.
Users of ratings, such as investment banks, said
policymakers are aiming at the wrong target.
 ""They should be focusing on getting stability back to the
market and a European ratings agency is not going to do that,""
said Mark Austen, acting chief executive of the Association for
Financial Markets in Europe.
 AFME members include banks and primary market bond dealers
who use ratings.
 ""We are unclear how a publicly controlled ratings agency
would be independent to rate what is effectively its own debt so
that the market has confidence in it,"" Austen said.
 
 DARK MOOD
 Jose-Manuel Barroso, president of the EU's executive
European Commission, criticised on Wednesday what he called the
deficient work of rating agencies, saying they let the dark mood
in financial markets cloud their judgement.
 The EU's financial services commissioner, Michel Barnier,
signalled on Monday that further rules may be needed but some
financial industry officials believe policymakers are trying to
cow the sector to stop more major downgrades of sovereign debt,
especially in Portugal and Spain.
 Ratings agencies were slammed in the financial crisis for
giving high ratings to subprime mortgage-based products that
turned toxic and untradeable, and for being too slow in warning
investors.
 This led to new EU rules being phased in from September
requiring ratings agencies to register and undergo direct
supervision if they want to issue ratings in the 27-nation bloc.
 Eddy Wymeersch, chairman of the Committee of European
Securities Regulators (CESR), said last week a state-backed
agency could leave the EU open to huge liabilities.
 CESR member Jean-Pierre Jouyet, head of France's AMF stock
market regulator, said this week a public European agency would
not be credible outside Europe and preferred an international
one, perhaps guided by the International Monetary Fund.

(Adds comment, details)
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a 14-month low
against the dollar on Thursday, reeling from escalating concerns
that Greece's debt crisis may spread to other euro zone states.
 The euro fell as low as $1.2717 on electronic trading
platform EBS, its weakest since March 2009, as investors awaited
comments from the European Central Bank on how it plans to help
prevent contagion from Greece.
 ""There are political constraints to the extent this Greek
fiscal adjustment can go and there is a risk of contagion,"" said
Michael Hart, currency strategist at Citigroup.
 The ECB left interest rates on hold as widely expected, with
attention switching to its press conference at 1230 GMT. 
 European policymakers have warned the euro's survival
depends on a life-support package for Greece announced last
week. This has ratcheted up risk aversion and boosted safe-haven
demand for the dollar, pushing it to a one-year high versus a
currency basket on Thursday.
 By 1148 GMT, the euro traded 0.7 percent lower on the day at
$1.2730.
 The euro trimmed losses after Spain sold five-year
government debt, albeit at a higher yield than at its last sale
in March, quelling some market concerns over Madrid's credit
risks.
 
 ECB
 The euro has fallen some 4 percent versus the dollar this
week, putting it on track for its worst weekly performance since
October 2008.
 It sank across the board on Thursday, plumbing a one-year
low against the yen of 118.85 yen on EBS, while sliding to its
lowest against sterling since August 2009.
 It also hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc, with
traders citing bids pulled by the Swiss central bank in the
1.4325 franc region as helping to accelerate the single
currency's fall.
 Risk aversion boosted the dollar, pushing it to a two-month
high against the Australian dollar, but the U.S. currency fell
against the yen, which also rose broadly due to its perceived
safe-haven appeal.
 The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 93.70 yen.
 Sterling hit a five-week low against the dollar as polls
opened for UK parliamentary elections. The pound came under
selling pressure as surveys pointed to the possibility of no
party emerging with an overall majority.
 Confidence in the euro zone has been plummeting as markets
remain sceptical that Athens will be able to consolidate its
budget, while Greek social unrest intensifies. Three people died
on Wednesday when rioters set fire to a bank.
 ""The crisis is now being more fuelled not by the size of the
aid package but by the scale of austerity being forced upon
Greece in order to receive the aid,"" BTM UFJ said in a note.
 The focus switched to whether the ECB suggested it was
considering tools such as purchasing government debt to stop the
rout, which has raised the cost of insuring Greek, Spanish and
Portuguese debt against default.
 ""With all the speculation of the options policymakers can
take, we see a high possibility that they will be disappointed.
Perhaps we won't see anything more than verbal support from the
ECB, and that could add some pressure to the euro,"" said Kasper
Kirkegaard, currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen.

 REYKJAVIK, May 6 (Reuters) - Iceland's erupting volcano has
showed signs of increased activity, but the cloud of ash which
wreaked havoc on European air travel is blowing clear of busy
flight paths, a panel of scientists said on Thursday.
 High altitude winds were pushing the ash cloud directly
south over the north Atlantic at a height of about nine
kilometres with little impact on flight patterns in northern
Europe, except in parts of Ireland, the scientists said.
 ""The effect on European air traffic should be negligible but
that, of course, is up to aviation authorities in each country,""
meteorologist Gudrun Nina Peterson told a news conference.
 The ash cloud rising from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano,
located beneath a glacier in southern Iceland, disrupted air
travel over northern Europe for a week last month, robbing
cash-starved airlines of billions of euros in revenue.
 The cloud had shot up as high as 10 kilometres into the air
on Tuesday, higher than during the crisis last month, before
subsiding somewhat on Wednesday, Peterson said.
 Experts said they had picked up signs of increasing seismic
activity deep under the volcano which indicated that magma was
forcing its way up through layers of rock and approaching the
volcanic crust.
 ""The eruption is going at full speed,"" said geophysicist
Sigurlaug Hjaltadottir. ""This is evident by our measurements and
by the fact that there is still quite a bit of ash production in
the volcano, coupled with massive explosions.""
 So far the eruption has produced little lava and large
amounts of ash -- the result of a fragmentation process by which
magma breaks down on its way to the surface under pressure of
expanding gases to form tiny, abrasive particles.
 If absorbed into the engines of an airplane, the ash
particles can cause serious damage.
 Hjaltadottir added that ash was still falling over the
sparsely populated farm land around the volcano, some 120
kilometres southeast of Reykjavik, but at a far lower rate than
at the start of the eruption.
 Earlier on Thursday, Ireland lifted all restrictions on its
airports on Thursday after a volcanic ash cloud blew away from
Europe after having disrupted flights for days.

 * At World Economic Forum with Tsvangirai, Mutambara
 * All reiterate Western sanctions on Zimbabwe should end
 
 By Matthew Tostevin
 DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe made a surprise showing at Africa's biggest business
meeting on Thursday to appeal for investment alongside other
members of the fractious coalition government.
 Mugabe dismissed investor worries over new ownership laws
which are designed to ensure that black Zimbabweans hold a stake
of at least 51 percent in all companies and which have strained
the unity government.
 ""People have said it will drive away investment. We say it
won't,"" Mugabe said at the World Economic Forum for Africa.
 ""Companies have been forthcoming ... I don't think it's a
painful thing for them. Forty-nine percent is a lot,"" he told
reporters.
 Mugabe took the stage at the World Economic Forum for Africa
with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, an old rival who joined
him in a unity government last year, and Arthur Mutambara, the
third member of the coalition.
 Zimbabwe's economy grew last year for the first time in a
decade after the scrapping of a near worthless local currency
and the political agreement.
 In Harare, Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce Minister
Welshman Ncube told Reuters in an interview Mugabe had rejected
bids by foreign steel firms wanting to take over the country's
grounded state-owned steelmaker because they ""too big"".
 Ncube said Mugabe preferred to deal with medium-sized firms.
 Western countries are withholding aid to push for faster
political reform and there has been no major inflow of foreign
investment because of the continuing uncertainty over the
government and its policies.
 ""Zimbabwe is ready to do business. If Africa's time has come
for investment, then Zimbabwe cannot miss the boat,"" Tsvangirai
said at the meeting, which has highlighted Africa's relatively
rapid emergence from the global downturn.
 ""The political crisis does no longer exist. The country is
making progress and it's time that investors started looking at
Zimbabwe from a different perspective. So that is the message we
have been communicating.""
 Tsvangirai stressed that discussion was continuing on the
empowerment law and its application.
 Both Mugabe and Tsvangirai reiterated appeals for an end to
Western sanctions targeting the 86-year-old leader and his
closest aides. He has ruled since independence in 1980 and is
accused by critics of ruining the country.
 ""It doesn't make sense that people from the same government
are not able to travel because of the travel ban,"" Tsvangirai
said.

Exports 28.9 20.0/37.0 24.3 -22.6
Imports 53.8 35.5/64.0 66.0 -23.0
Trade balance -2.5 -7.5/7.8 -7.2 13.1
 * FACTORS TO WATCH:
 After China's trade plunged into the red in March for the
first time since April 2004, government officials said the
deficit was just a blip. But 17 out of 26 economists polled by
Reuters expect another deficit for April.
 Exports are likely to have stayed robust, but year-on-year
import growth is projected to have been even stronger.
 Some of those imports will be in anticipation of rising
commodity prices and a recovery in exports, but the strength of
imports also suggests government policies to stoke domestic
demand are starting to pay off.
 Beijing has said China's trade surplus for 2010 is likely
to be as much as $100 billion less than 2009, when it fell by a
third to $196 billion, thanks to strong imports of energy and
raw materials to feed the booming domestic economy.
 * MARKET IMPACT:
 Another deficit may give Beijing fresh pause for thought
about agreeing to a long-expected resumption of the yuan's
rise.
 Stronger-than-expected imports could reinforce fears that
the economy is over-heating and so stir speculation of further
tightening from Beijing.
 The central bank raised banks' reserve requirements on
Sunday for the third time this year, while the government has
taken a series of steps to cool the property market.

 * Wants to reduce high debt with faster growth
 * Strategy risky against backdrop of euro zone debt woes
 
 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, May 6 (Reuters) - Hungary's new government plans
to run higher deficits to boost growth but its scope to do so is
limited due to the country's high debt and the Greek crisis, and
could only work if accompanied by credible reforms.
 Centre-right Fidesz, which won elections last month, wants
to cut taxes to kickstart the economy in the hope that faster
growth will help Hungary grow out of its high debt which makes
it the most vulnerable in central Europe.
 By talking about a higher budget deficit trajectory than
envisaged in Hungary's existing agreement with its lenders,
Fidesz has embarked on a risky path at a time when markets are
fretting over debt problems on the euro zone periphery.
 Financial markets seem to have given Fidesz the benefit of
the doubt and expect it to use its strong mandate to carry out
structural reforms -- in the government sector, education,
healthcare and taxation -- to make the economy more competitive.
 But they also expect it to keep fiscal policy tight and
offset any planned tax reductions with spending cuts.
""I hope the new government will have the courage and the
vision to make significant structural reforms and that is the
reason why it is now talking about higher deficits than agreed
with the IMF,"" said Anders Svendsen at Nordea bank.
 A higher gap could be acceptable if they were for reforms
with upfront costs but which would result in lower deficits and
higher structural growth in the long term, he said.
 ""But a higher deficit without any longer-term return would
be bad for investor perception,"" Svendsen said.
 A looser fiscal path would mean Hungary's public debt -- the
highest in 2009 in central Europe at 78.3 percent of GDP --
would not peak and reverse this year as planned based on current
targets, only later.
""There is a risk that Hungary could again attract attention
mainly due to its high debt,"" said Zoltan Torok at Raiffeisen.
""The government has to weigh the potential benefit on growth
from a larger deficit, against the potential negative drag on
growth from a potential confidence loss as investors doubt its
commitment to debt reduction,"" added Christian Keller at
Barclays in London.
 Contagion from the eurozone's worsening debt woes hit
emerging Europe this week, pushing the forint to a six-month low
versus the euro  earlier on Thursday.
 
 BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW
 Fidesz will also have to sell the idea of higher deficits to
the International Monetary Fund and the EU which rescued Hungary
from collapse in October 2008, as it wants a new deal with
lenders to have it as a safety net.
 Fidesz has said this year's budget deficit could sharply
exceed the current target of 3.8 percent of GDP laid out in the
financing deal, due to a lag in revenues and some items not
consolidated into the budget and it wants to renegotiate the
target with lenders.
 Economy minister designate Gyorgy Matolcsy said on Thursday
the 2010 deficit could come in at 7-8 percent of GDP based on
current estimates but the new government would seek to get it
down to 5-6 percent. He has said the new cabinet would cut the
gap by 0.5-1.0 percentage points per year in coming years.
 This means that next year Hungary would not bring its
deficit below 3 percent of GDP -- which is not an IMF target but
a key commitment to the EU as the country is still under the
Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).
 The Commission said on Wednesday Hungary will have to cut
its deficit further from a projected 4.1 percent this year.
 ""Hungary has to put an end to its excessive deficit
by 2011 at the latest which implies a need for further
deficit-reducing measures at the latest next year of more than 1
percent of GDP,"" the European Commission said in a report.
 Matolcsy said the main goal was to improve the economy's
competitiveness by cutting taxes and bureaucracy which would
amount to a ""tax revolution"" and would help create jobs.
""In terms of scope for tax cuts, the EU is only likely to
facilitate this in a scenario whereby the authorities put
forward expenditure reductions to compensate,"" said Gillian
Edgeworth of Deutsche Bank.
 Matolcsy said fiscal incentives were also needed to boost
home construction, environmental investments and agriculture.
 ""Fiscal balance is very important and we must cut (the
deficit) every year but the area where the main focus will be is
how we can reduce debt and start growth,"" Matolcsy said.
""The situation today is that this is a trap, a debt trap,
which we can escape only by growth,"" he said.
 
 CONDITIONS NOT IDEAL
 While reducing debt with the help of faster growth could
work in theory, the present global environment with a still
fragile recovery may not be the ideal setting for this.
 With household consumption projected to fall further this
year and banks still reluctant to lend, Hungary's recovery is
slower than in nearby Poland or the Czech Republic which are
seen growing by 2.9 and 1.5 percent respectively this year.
 Hungary's economy is seen stagnating in 2010 .
 ""Let's assume the debt level rises somewhat nominally, while
GDP grows really fast, in this case yes, we can outgrow debt,""
Torok said. ""But this usually works when global sentiment
(growth) is very positive and now this is not the case.""
 He said it seemed more likely that Hungary will ""muddle
through"" with its economy growing again in the next years but
not seeing annual growth rates of around 5-6 percent.
 ""The new government will have to implement structural
reforms and reduce the deficit at the same time,"" Barclays'
Keller said.
 ""Growth will have to come mainly from exports during this
period -- this is not the time for trying to stimulate domestic
demand through fiscal measures in Hungary.""

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a 14-month low
against the dollar on Thursday, reeling from escalating concerns
that Greece's debt crisis may spread to other euro zone states.
 The euro fell as low as $1.2737, according to electronic
trading platform EBS, its weakest since March 2009, as investors
awaited comments from the European Central Bank on how it plans
to help prevent contagion from Greece.
 European policymakers have warned the euro's survival
depends on a life-support package for Greece announced last
week. This has ratcheted up risk aversion and boosted safe-haven
demand for the dollar, pushing it to a one-year high versus a
currency basket on Thursday.
 ""The driver remains concerns about the European situation,
coupled with poor risk sentiment,"" said Kasper Kirkegaard,
currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen.
 By 0946 GMT, the euro traded 0.3 percent lower on the day at
$1.2770.
 The euro trimmed some losses after Spain managed to sell
five-year government debt, albeit at a higher yield than at its
last sale in March, which quelled some market concerns that
Madrid's credit risks may be rising quickly.
 ""The auction results suggested a feeling that the contagion,
at least for Spain, may not be that strong,"" said Lutz
Karpowitz, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""But who knows how long this relief will last?""
 
 ECB AWAITED
 The euro has stumbled some 4 percent versus the dollar this
week, putting it on track for its worst weekly performance since
October 2008.
 It has broken key support at $1.2994, the 76.4 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the euro's trough-to-peak move in
2008-2009. The next level is seen around $1.2550 with many in
the market already eyeing its 2008 low around $1.2330.
 The euro sank across the board, plumbing a one-year low
against the yen of 118.85 yen on EBS, while sliding to its
lowest against sterling since August 2009.
 It also hit a one-month low against the Swiss franc, with
traders citing bids pulled by the Swiss central bank as helping
to accelerate the single currency's fall.
 Risk aversion boosted the dollar, pushing it to a two-month
high against the Australian dollar, but the U.S. currency fell
against the yen, which also rose broadly due to its perceived
safe-haven appeal.
 The dollar slipped 0.2 percent to 93.70 yen.
 Sterling hit a five-week low against the dollar as polls
opened for UK parliamentary elections. The pound came under
selling pressure as surveys continued to point to the
possibility of no party emerging with an overall majority.
 Confidence in the euro zone has been plummeting as markets
remain sceptical that Athens will be able to consolidate its
budget, while Greek social unrest intensifies, resulting in
three deaths on Wednesday.
 ""The crisis is now being more fuelled not by the size of the
aid package but by the scale of austerity being forced upon
Greece in order to receive the aid,"" BTM UFJ said in a note.
 Investors waited to see what reassurance the ECB will offer
at its 1230 GMT news conference. It is widely expected to keep
rates unchanged at 1 percent at its 1145 GMT policy
announcement.
 The focus will be on whether the central bank suggests it is
considering tools such as purchasing government debt to stop the
rout, which has raised the cost of insuring Greek, Spanish and
Portuguese debt against default.
 Kirkegaard at Danske said a lack of a strong response from
the ECB may put the euro under additional selling pressure.
 ""With all the speculation of the options policymakers can
take, we see a high possibility that they will be disappointed.
Perhaps we won't see anything more than verbal support from the
ECB, and that could add some pressure to the euro,"" he said.

 By Astrid Wendlandt
 PARIS, May 6 (Reuters) - Hermes posted the biggest surge in
first-quarter sales of all European luxury goods companies on
Thursday, pointing to a continued polarisation of the market in
which well-established brands crush weaker rivals.
 The maker of 15,000-euro ($20,100) crocodile handbags and
silk scarves confirmed the nascent rebound in the luxury goods
market, particularly in the United States where sales rose 25
percent at constant currencies during the first quarter.
 In Europe -- a market highly dependent on tourists -- Hermes
revenue rose 15 percent, while in Asia, exluding Japan, it was
up 47 percent.
 Overall, Hermes sales in the three months to March 31 rose
18.5 percent to 507.7 million euros, or 20.2 percent at constant
currencies.
 By comparison, like-for-like sales from fashion and leather
goods at luxury giant LVMH rose 10 percent in the first quarter,
while at Gucci Group they were 6.1 percent higher. During
Burberry's first-half, they rose 6 percent.
 But looking ahead, Hermes cautioned that the strong
performance might not last throughout the year.
""First-quarter sales growth cannot be extrapolated to the
full year owing to the more favourable basis of comparison with
the same year-ago period and to persistent economic
uncertainties,"" Hermes said in a statement.
 Several brokers, including Vontobel, said Hermes's full-year
target of at least 5 percent sales growth looked too
conservative and added that they planned to lift their 2010
sales forecasts.
 Vontobel said it would increase its current-year sales
growth forecast to 10 percent from around 8 percent at constant
currencies.
 ""Despite the strong improvement in Q1, we were quite
surprised not to see an upgrade of the FY10 guidance but
according to management, the environment continues to be
uncertain,"" HSBC said in a note.
 Hermes shares were up 3.35 percent at 102.55 euros at 0924
GMT.

 By 0754 GMT, the euro traded 0.2 percent lower on the day at

 Traders said euro selling demand from Asian central banks in

 The euro has broken key support levels and the next level is

2008 low around $1.2330.

of no party emerging with an overall majority.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - World shares fell and the euro
came under renewed pressure on Thursday in what is shaping up to
be a major flight to safety by investors fearful that the Greek
debt crisis is gaining momentum.
 Wall Street looked set for a tentative start, despite some
gains on European bourses.
 Emerging markets, many of which are in reasonable economic
shape and relatively removed from euro zone stress, were
particularly hard hit, with shares down 1.5 percent.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was down three-quarters
of a percent.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index fell in early trading but
then put in modest gains after strong results from BNP Paribas.
It was up 0.3 percent.
 Japan's Nikkei tumbled more than 3 percent, catching up with
other bourses after a three-day holiday.
 ""There's no let-up in concerns that the euro zone debt
crisis could continue to worsen and as a result equity markets
across the globe remain under pressure,"" said Ben Potter,
analyst at IG Markets.
 ""The bull market always had to end somewhere and it looks
like this could be the trigger.""
 Focus was on the European Central Bank, which left interest
rates unchanged but was expected later to address the crisis,
which saw deadly riots in Athens on Wednesday and pressure
building on Spain, Portugal and others.
 ""The ECB president will have to justify his recent decision
to accept Greek bonds indefinitely as collateral regardless of
their credit rating,"" Brown Brothers Harriman said in a note.

 EURO WOE
 The euro tumbled to a 14-month low against the dollar.
 European policymakers have warned the euro's survival
depends on a life-support package for Greece agreed last
weekend. This has ratcheted up risk aversion and boosted

of 118.85 yen on EBS, but recovered a bit to 119.7 yen.

 * Pressure seen on domestic bonds
 
 (Adds analyst, background)
 PRAGUE, May 6 (Reuters) - The Czech government plans to cut
euro bond issuance to 28 percent of its overall debt issuance
this year, from an original estimate of around 50 percent, due
to a spike in borrowing costs following the Greek debt crisis,
Finance Minister Eduard Janota was quoted on Thursday as saying.
 Czechs put off plans in April to issue a 1-2 billion euro
bond due to the turmoil in Greece. Elsewhere in the region,
Poland has also said it may trim debt issuance if global market
tensions persist.
 Czech gross borrowing needs this year are seen at 280
billion crowns ($14 billion). Janota told daily Lidove Noviny
that the government had planned to issue about half of that in
euros but had now revised that as the Greek debt crisis has
raised borrowing costs across Europe.
 ""Originally we planned to issue bonds in an overall amount
of 280 billion crowns, while about a half should have been in
euros,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying.
 ""Due to the unfavourable situation on markets we will likely
cut the share of euro bonds to 28 percent,"" he said.
 Janota added that the average yield on euro bonds had risen
by 0.4 percentage points since the end of 2009 and a 15-year
euro bond yield was now at 5 percent, up from 4.5 percent at the
end of the last year.
 The Czech government has so far issued bonds worth 56.6
billion crowns, according to Finance Ministry data compiled by
Reuters.
 ""This implies the second quarter crown issuance at some 90
billion, a way higher than the second quarter averages in the
last few years, something that shall raise the pressure on
domestic bonds once again,"" said Dalimil Vyskovsky, an interest
rate trader at Komercni Banka.
 ""The news, though, can still change in our opinion, as both
the spreads and the new finance minister's stance can vary
during the rest of the year.""
 Janota is a member of a technocrat government installed in
spring last year and an election on May 28-29 is expected to
usher in an administration with a stronger political mandate.
 The government targets a public sector deficit of 5.3
percent of GDP this year, down from 5.9 percent last year, and
Janota said he would need to find additional cuts of up to 16
billion crowns to meet that target. [ID:nPRG004085].

 (Adds Constancio comments, Trichet speech)
 By Sergio Goncalves and Axel Bugge
 LISBON, May 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank resisted
market pressure to ride to the rescue of struggling euro zone
countries on Thursday, giving verbal support to Greece's tough
savings plan but stopping short of any fresh action.
 The ECB kept benchmark interest rates at a record low of 1
percent for the 12th month in a row and ignored calls for extra
cash injections or the use of its 'nuclear option' -- a purchase
of Greek and possibly other countries' government bonds to halt
the debt crisis that is threatening the euro's survival.
 President Jean-Claude Trichet said the bank's policymakers
did not even discuss the prospect of buying government bonds at
their Lisbon meeting, despite intense market speculation.
 Financial markets showed their disappointment, with the euro
plunging to a fresh 14-month low against the dollar and the
premium investors demand to hold Portuguese and Spanish
government bonds flaring to record highs.
 ""Mr. Trichet is going for the 'crisis, what crisis?'
approach,"" said Gary Jenkins from Evolution Securities. ""I am
not convinced that this denial of the problems facing European
sovereigns is healthy.""
 Still, economists said it was possible the ECB would do a
U-turn on bond purchases in the future if other countries are
also engulfed by a lack of market confidence in their ability to
service debt, noting Trichet did not rule out such a move.
 Trichet said the ECB remained permanently alert and was able
to take appropriate decisions, even if they were unconventional,
without wavering from its price stability goal.
 ""We will never, never put in jeopardy the anchoring of
inflation expectations and the delivery of price stability which
is our major asset,"" he said. 
 
 CALL FOR THRIFT
 Flanked by outgoing Vice-President Lucas Papademos and his
replacement Vitor Constancio, currently head of the Portuguese
central bank, Trichet said Spain and Portugal were not in the
same boat as Greece.
 Stressing that calls for fiscal thrift and bold structural
reforms applied to all euro-zone countries, he reiterated the
ECB's backing for Greece's savings plans and dismissed the
prospect of any euro zone member defaulting on debt.
 ""Default is, for me, out of the question,"" he said.
 In a speech at Lisbon's Universidade Nova, Trichet hit out
at speculators who take out contracts to insure against default
without owning the bond in question, saying the mutation of
arbitrage into speculation should be reversed.
 The cost of insuring Portuguese debt against default has hit
record highs in recent days and Constancio said Portugal could
not afford to ignore market signals, urging his government to
consider new savings measures.

 Trichet said this week's decision to scrap collateral rating
requirements on Greek debt -- which some policymakers had
opposed -- was an acknowledgement of the extent of the country's
economic recovery programme.
 Asked if the ECB would do the same for other euro zone
members, he said the decision was made for Greece alone.
 He gave no indication the bank planned to roll back its
progressive unwinding of stimulus measures for the banking
sector by adding longer maturities to its liquidity operations.
 Non-conventional measures remained in place for one-week and
one-month operations and as far as three-month lending was
concerned, it was not the bank's intention to push rates above 1
percent, Trichet said.
 
 GROWTH AMID UNCERTAINTY
 The ECB said it expected the euro zone economy to grow at a
moderate pace this year, though growth could be uneven ""in an
environment of high uncertainty"", and said global inflation
pressures were on the rise.
 Trichet noted recent survey data had been encouraging.
 ""We had a number of ... data that were quite encouraging ...
in the most recent period of time,"" he said, adding that he
remained prudent.
 Rising global inflationary pressures were not yet
threatening price stability in the euro zone, where domestic
price pressures remain low, Trichet said.
 However, commodity prices and areas seeing rapid growth were
pushing up global inflation trends.
 ""Risks to price stability over the medium term are viewed as
still remaining broadly balanced,"" he said of the euro zone.
 He also confirmed that the ECB sees rates as appropriate,
implying no change is to be expected in the near future.

(Updates with Greek parliament approving bill, Fed comments)
 By George Georgiopoulos and Jeremy Gaunt
 ATHENS/LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - The Greek parliament
approved a harsh austerity plan on Thursday in the face of
violent unrest, as European Central Bank inaction pushed down
global markets fearful a debt crisis will engulf the euro zone.
 Shock waves from a crisis in a relatively small European
economy spread far beyond the continent, with Wall Street
falling and the Federal Reserve expressing concern about
potential consequences for the U.S. economy itself.
 On the markets, the euro slid against the dollar and tumbled
against the yen after the ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
failed to offer any new measures to ease Greece's debt crisis,
while stock prices tumbled around the world.
 In Athens, parliament approved the government's 30 billion
euro ($40 billion) austerity bill, imposing years of hard
measures in return for a 110 billion euro ($147.6 billion)
rescue by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
 ""This is the time for change. There is not a single day or
hour to lose,"" Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou said.
But he had to expel three Socialist deputies who abstained in a
preliminary vote rather than backing their government.
 
 DEFECTIONS
 The defections were a first sign of the problems Papandreou
faces within his own party in applying the harsh measures needed
to pull Greece out of a crisis shaking international markets.
 As the vote took place, a crowd of around 10,000 protesting
students, workers and pensioners converged on parliament to
voice their opposition to the bill, chanting ""Take to the
streets! Say 'No' to the measures that hurt the Greek people!""
 On Wednesday, in the biggest and most violent protest since
riots shook the country in 2008, some 50,000 Greeks marched in
Athens and clashed with police in pitched street battles. A
petrol bomb attack killed three workers in a local bank branch.
 Germany, the biggest European contributor to the bailout for
Athens, faces parliamentary votes on Friday. The Bundestag lower
house of parliament is due to start debating a draft law on the
German contribution at 0700 GMT.
 The debate is due to last two hours, after which lawmakers
will vote. The upper house is scheduled to vote on the bill soon
afterwards. Both houses are expected to give their approval.
 
 NO LET-UP
 On the markets, MSCI's all-country world stock index
tumbled 1.5 percent to 291.81, its lowest since March 2. In the
United States, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.17
points, or 0.78 percent, to 10,782.95.
 ""There's no let-up in concerns that the euro zone debt
crisis could continue to worsen and as a result equity markets
across the globe remain under pressure,"" said Ben Potter,
analyst at IG Markets. 
 ECB chief Trichet proved a big disappointment when he said a
meeting of the bank's Governing Council in Lisbon had not
discussed buying bonds to combat the crisis.
 Trichet reiterated the ECB's backing for Greece's savings
plans and dismissed the prospect of any euro zone member
defaulting on debt. ""Default is, for me, out of the question,""
he said.
 In reaction, the euro tumbled to a 14-month low of $1.2652.
 ""Nothing short of a sensational announcement can help the
euro at this point. And that certainly did not come from
Trichet,"" said Kathy Lien, a director for currency research at
GFT Forex, in New York.
 Policymakers' attempts to talk down the risk of contagion
and scare off ""speculators"" had little impact on traders
unimpressed by the slow EU response to the crisis.
 Yield spreads widened for weaker euro zone countries at risk
of being sucked into the debt crisis as investors headed for the
greater safety of German government debt. Portuguese, Spanish
and even Italian bonds were affected.
 In a globalised economy, problems spread fast and the euro
zone's troubles provoked worries far afield. 
 U.S. central bankers said the Federal Reserve was closely
monitoring the financial turbulence in Europe as it could have
repercussions for the United States and its markets.
 James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, argued the
crisis posed a threat to an otherwise improving U.S. economy.
""One risk to the outlook ... is the fallout from potential
sovereign debt default as conditions continue to deteriorate in
Greece and other countries,"" he said.
 
 CONFLAGRATION
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said any
restructuring of Greek debt would cause ""exactly the kind of
conflagration that we could no longer control"".
 ""We are in a really fundamental crisis, the stability of the
euro is really at stake,"" he added. 
 European Council President Herman van Rompuy, who will chair
a euro zone summit on the crisis on Friday, was the latest top
EU official to try to erect a verbal firewall, saying the
situation of Portugal or Spain had nothing to do with Greece.
 ""What I now see are totally irrational movements on the
markets set off by unsubstantiated rumours, for instance
yesterday with Spain, but also as regards Portugal,"" he said.
 The cost of insuring Portuguese and Spanish debt as well as
Greek debt against default leapt to new peaks before a closely
watched auction of 5-year Spanish bonds. Yields jumped for the
auction but there was no shortage of demand.

 By Sakari Suoninen
 FRANKFURT, May 6 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will
be under pressure on Thursday to show it can stop the Greek debt
crisis from engulfing other euro zone members, with investors
keen for signs it has further ammunition up its sleeve.
 With the central bank holding rates at a record low of 1.0
percent seen as a foregone conclusion by economists, markets are
focusing on its message on Greece and what it will do to stop
the problems infecting countries such as Portugal, Ireland and
Spain.
 Analysts will look especially for clues whether the ECB is
moving towards the use of its 'nuclear option' -- a purchase of
Greek -- and possibly other countries' -- government bonds to
halt the debt crisis that is threatening the euro's survival.

 While the ECB is likely to encourage confidence in Greece's
efforts to cut its budget deficit, simply saying this will not
satisfy the financial markets.
 Buying government bonds is the strongest weapon the ECB has,
but it does have some other options, including reintroducing
some of the emergency lending measures it has been trying to
phase out.
 The ECB has stopped lending in dollars and Swiss francs and
over six and 12-month maturities as markets and the economy
recovered, but could re-start these lines without much fuss.
 Tullett Prebon economist Lena Komileva saw buying bonds as
the only option. ""They've left the door open because they cannot
afford to close the door.""
 European laws prevent the ECB from buying debt directly from
governments in the way the United States and Britain's central
banks have done during the financial crisis.
 But the ECB could get round this restriction by buying debt
second-hand from banks. At the weekend ECB President Jean-Claude
Trichet appeared to soften his stance on this once unthinkable
option.
 While the possible purchase of bonds is likely to be
discussed in the Governing Council meeting in an away meeting in
Lisbon, it might be too early for the ECB to make the move -- it
might not want to deplete its arsenal quite yet and even
hammering out the technical details will take time.
 ""If they decided to do that, it seems more weeks away than
days away. If the market were to deteriorate further, then it
would call for action sooner rather than later,"" RBS economist
Nick Matthews said.
 
 SIZING UP
 As the Greek situation has become more acute, policymaker
fears of the problems spreading have increased.

fate was at stake [ID:nLDE6440HH]
 International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn and
ECB heavyweight Axel Weber have both warned of serious contagion
risks. [ID:nSGE644093]
 Portugal, Spain and Ireland are seen as the most likely
victims. They all carry high deficits and have already seen
their borrowing costs rise on the back of Greece's problems.
 Contagion fears have also hit the common currency. The euro
hit a one-year low against the dollar on Wednesday on the
concerns.
 Analysts are also expecting to hear the rationale behind the
ECB's move on Monday to suspend its minimum threshold for Greek
debt, meaning the bonds will remain eligible as collateral
regardless of the country ratings.
 The decision, the second change to the ECB's borrowing rules
in less than two months, will guarantee Greek banks' access to
cheap central bank funding, and economists are eager to hear why
the exception was not extended to any government debt issued in
the euro zone.
 The Greek woes have solidified expectations among economists
that interest rates will stay on hold at their current record
low for at least the rest of the year [ECB/INT]. All 78
economists polled by Reuters expect it to make it a full year at
1.0 percent this time around.

 By Lionel Laurent and Nina Sovich
 BRUSSELS/PARIS, May 6 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas revealed a 5
billion euro ($6.7 billion) exposure to Greece,
the largest among major French banks, as worries over contagion
from the debt crisis keep lenders under pressure.
 France's biggest listed bank said however it would not lend
a helping hand to Greece by participating in a rescue package,
as some German banks plan to do.
 ""The commitments we have made (on Greece) we will keep ...
We will do all this but nothing more,"" chief executive Baudouin
Prot told a news conference in Brussels, at the headquarters of
the Fortis bank the French group acquired as part of a rescue
deal.
 The chief financial officer of Commerzbank, Eric Strutz,
however said on a conference call about his bank's results that
the private sector contribution to the Greece rescue was a joint
Franco-German initiative.
 BNP on Thursday posted first-quarter net profit that beat
analyst forecasts, thanks to improved market conditions and the
integration of Fortis, and said the economic recovery had begun.
 Speaking on BFM radio Prot tried to calm fears that the
Greek economic crisis could spread. 
 ""All the scenarios for the contagion of the Greek crisis to
Spain and Portugal are unfounded,"" he said.
 He told Radio Classique meanwhile that BNP had decided not
to reveal its exposure to euro zone countries aside from Greece.
 The bank pegged its Greek sovereign debt exposure at 5
billion euros, a day after smaller rival Societe Generale said
its exposure was 3 billion euros.
 BNP also said Thursday that it had 3 billion euros in
corporate commitments in Greece, mainly with international firms
and with risks that had ""minimal correlation"" to Greece's
economy.
 BNP's other major French rival, Credit Agricole, has said
its sovereign Greek exposure is 850 million euros.
 French bank Natixis' parent company BPCE said on Thursday
its exposure to Greece stood at 2.1 billion euros, including 882
million at Natixis. Sovereign exposure was 1.4 billion.
 This puts BNP firmly ahead of both French peers in Greek
exposure. However, unlike them, BNP does not have a significant
banking subsidiary within Greece, and analysts see the group as
relatively less vulnerable to the broader Greek economy.
 
 RECOVERY SIGNS
 BNP reported first-quarter net profit of 2.3 billion euros
on Thursday, a 47 percent rise year-on-year and higher than the
average forecast of 1.6 billion in a Reuters poll of 11
analysts.
 BNP shares rose on the news and were up 2.37 percent at
48.91 euros at 1152 GMT, outperforming a flat STOXX Europe banks
index. 
 BNP beat analyst forecasts on higher revenues and lower
provisions, Citigroup analyst Kimon Kalamboussis said in a note,
noting that revenues rose 22 percent year-on-year and expenses
were up less than 2 percent.
 Capital markets revenues were particularly strong, Citi
said, while the equity and advisory unit recorded the ""best
ever"" quarterly results driven by strength in derivatives. 
 BNP's good results were also due to lower loan provisions as
financial market conditions improved, helping BNP's corporate
and investment banking unit squeeze out more profit.
 ""The first quarter 2010 has seen signs of the beginning of
economic recovery,"" the group said.
 Going forward these provisions for 2010 should also
continue to fall at the current rate, Prot said on CNBC, further
helping the company turn strong profits.
 Since the second quarter of 2009 provisions at BNP have been
steadily declining, said Jaap Meijer of Evolution securities in
a note, underpinning the view that BNP is well provisioned.
 BNP's acquisition of assets of Benelux bank Fortis, a deal
which closed in May last year, also helped. BNP said it had made
254 million euros in related cost savings as of March 31, which
it said was in line with previous announcements.
 BNP also said its American subsidiary BancWest had returned
to profit during the first quarter.
 BNP shares have fallen 14.5 percent year to date, giving the
group a market capitalisation of 58.2 billion euros. This is
worse than the 7.3 percent fall seen by the STOXX banks index in
the same period.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2010 12:56AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-Tough for China to keep inflation under 5 pct," * Inflation risk is price to pay for last year's stimulus
 * China needs to coordinate rate rise with major economies
 * Yuan should be more flexible but must move gradually
 By Benjamin Kang Lim and Simon Rabinovitch
 BEIJING, May 6 (Reuters) - China will be doing well if it can
keep inflation below 5 percent this year, influential former
lawmaker Cheng Siwei said, one of the starkest warnings yet about
price pressures facing the economy.
 While it is ""imperative"" to increase interest rates, he said
this might not be feasible, marking a rare admission about how
Beijing feels that its hands are tied on monetary policy.
 With expectations rising for yuan appreciation, higher rates
would only serve to attract more speculative capital to China and
add to the economy's excess liquidity, the former vice-chairman
of the national parliament told Reuters in an interview.
 As a result, Cheng said China must try to coordinate policy
with other major economies, to increase interest rates at the
same time as the United States, the euro zone and Japan. He said
G20 meetings at the end of June would provide a good opportunity
to discuss this coordination.
 Economists argue that China's decision to peg the yuan to the
dollar is what constrains its independence on monetary policy.
Cheng acknowledged this line of reasoning, but said reform of the
currency was not a simple matter and that the government should
only gradually move to a freely convertible currency.
 Although Cheng is no longer an official, he is still well
connected in Beijing and has knowledge of thinking at the highest
levels of government.
 INFLATION RISK
 The government is targetting an average of 3 percent consumer
price inflation this year.
 Officials have repeatedly stressed that managing inflationary
expectations is a priority, but have, at the same time,
maintained that price pressures are under control after inflation
averaged 2.2 percent in the first quarter.
 Cheng was less sanguine.
 ""Last year, China paid a heavy price in order to 'protect
eight',"" he said, referring to the stimulus spending and
explosion of bank lending unleashed in 2009 to ensure that the
economy would not slip below the government's target of 8 percent
growth.
 ""The result is that we have an inflation risk,"" he said.
""Last year, if we had not done this, the economy would have been
in bad shape. It was necessary. So it is now a question of
balance. This year, we are talking much less 'protecting
growth'.""
 China will fully exit from its stimulus policies in the
second half of 2010, he said.
 An official with the National Bureau of Statistics told
Reuters on Thursday that China should have no difficulty
achieving 9 percent economic growth this year but needs to beware
of mounting inflation. [ID:nTOE64502H]
 The central bank raised banks' reserve requirements for the
third time this year on Sunday and the government has already
guided banks to rein in their lending.
 ""The impact of required reserve ratio increases is very
small. Each 50 basis point rise absorbs just 300-500 billion
yuan. Raising interest rates is not the same. Higher rates will
translate to higher costs throughout society,"" he said.
 ""But we face a dilemma. If you raise rates, more hot money
will flow in from abroad. You raise rates to combat inflation,
but then you face this problem. So I believe that we must
coordinate our policy with other major countries,"" he said.
 YUAN FLEXIBILITY
 Chen gave no specific timetable for when Beijing might let
the yuan rise again, having frozen it against the dollar since
mid-2008 to help cushion the economy from the global financial
crisis.
 Despite the de facto re-pegging to the dollar over the past
21 months, Cheng said the official policy of managing the yuan
with reference to a basket of currencies was still in place.
 ""So I think the yuan might become a little more flexible in
the near future, but its formation mechanism will still refer to
a basket of currencies,"" he said.
 ""I advocate that we should increase its flexibility and allow
more small fluctuations,"" he added, stressing that he was
speaking in a personal capacity and not as a representative of
the government.
 With China's inflation rising and exports recovering, many in
the financial markets think it is only a matter of time before
Beijing resumes yuan appreciation. Investors expect a 2.5 percent
rise in the yuan against the dollar over the next 12 months,
according to the offshore forwards market.

 * Eyes on ECB, which may seek to assure mkts
 * Kiwi jumps after RBNZ's comments, jobs numbers
 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro edged up against the dollar
on short-covering on Thursday, after sliding to a fresh 14-month
low earlier, and as investors shifted focus to a European Central
Bank meeting later in the day.
 The yen retreated broadly after rising the previous day on
safe-haven inflows from investors spooked by comments from
European leaders who warned that the problems facing Greece could
spread to other countries.
 The euro's rebound, however, remained shallow as more players
want to sell the single currency on tops after it slid through
key support levels as concerns about the sovereign debt crisis in
the euro zone mounted, traders said.
 The euro has not been able to make a decent recovery since
its break below the $1.30 mark earlier this week, suggesting the
market is far from done with euro selling, traders said.
 ""Today's ECB policy meeting could trigger a rebound in the
euro, given the steep drop in the currency of late. But as people
know there will be no quick fix for Greece, euro selling is
unlikely to end soon,"" said Shuichi Kanehira, head of forex spot
trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent from late New York trade to $1.2846
after falling as low as $1.2789 on trading platform EBS as
options barriers were knocked out at $1.2800 in early Asian
trade.
 The euro has now broken key support levels and the next level
is seen around $1.2550 with many in the market already eyeing its
2008 low around $1.2330.
 The single currency lost more than 1 percent on Wednesday and
has shed more than 3.5 percent so far this week.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.2 percent at 120.54 after
having lost over 2 percent on Wednesday as investors fled to the
relative safety of the lower-yielding yen.
 ""The focus stays on the euro as the contagion trade
persists,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 ""Today's ECB meeting has grown immensely in importance as the
redeployment of some form of credit crisis tools seems
increasingly possible.""
 The ECB holds its monthly meeting later on Thursday and,
while it is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1 percent, it
should seek to assure markets that it can prevent the Greek debt
crisis spreading.
 The ECB meet comes as the cost of insuring Greek, Spanish and
Portuguese debt against default has been rising, while Moody's
put Portugal's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade
on Wednesday.
 FIRM DOLLAR
 The euro's weakness was helping the dollar index hold
impressive gains this week. The index dipped 0.2 percent to
83.934, but stayed within reach of a one-year high of 84.31 hit
earlier in the session.
 The dollar was up marginally on the yen at 93.90 yen, from
93.65 yen late on Wednesday when it lost over 1 percent.
 However, the dollar's rise could be capped by selling by
Japanese exporters as Tokyo resumed trade on Thursday after the
Golden Week holidays.
 On Wednesday, the greenback got a boost from data showing
U.S. private sector employers added 32,000 jobs last month,
bolstering the view that U.S. interest rates will likely rise
from record lows well before action on rates in the euro zone.
 Sterling rebounded against the dollar from its five-week lows
ahead of Britain's parliamentary election, with two polls
pointing to a hung parliament.
 The pound stood at $1.5134, up 0.2 percent and off
Wednesday's low of $1.5068, the lowest since late March.
 Meanwhile, the New Zealand dollar jumped over 1 percent at
one point after Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard
indicated that rate hikes would start from mid-year.. Also,
helping the kiwi were surprisingly strong jobs numbers.
 The Australian dollar fell after data showed March retail
sales grew less than forecast and following a second month of
soft sales. Analysts said softening retail sales showed consumers
were hurting from rising interest rates, and argued for the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to hold rates steady until
August.
 The kiwi was up 0.8 percent to $0.7270. The Aussie earlier
slipped to around $0.9050 after the data but recovered to trade
at $0.9075, up 0.1 percent.

 * Trade deficit widens in March, but set to narrow
 * Offers reason to pause on rate hikes in near term
 By Wayne Cole
 SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - Australian retail sales rose a
surprisingly subdued 0.3 percent in March, a second straight
month of weakness that could give policy makers extra reason to
hold off on further rate hikes in the next few months.
 The local dollar slipped as investors pared the chance of a
rate increase by August to around 60 percent, down from as much
as 85 percent earlier this week.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had already indicated
it was done for the moment after lifting its cash rate to 4.5
percent on Tuesday, the fifth move in six policy meetings.
""Consumers are taking a bit of a break,"" said Spiro
Papadopoulos, an economist at National Australia Bank.
 ""It's a sign the Reserve Bank can sit back for the next few
months and watch how the economy adjusts,"" he added. ""This is
further evidence that they don't need to go in June.""
 Investors had already written off a move in June, giving it
just an 11 percent probability, in part because of strains in
global markets induced by the Greek debt crisis.
Still, many analysts thought August remained in play.
 ""The fundamentals for consumption are still improving,""
noted RBS chief economist Kieran Davies.
 ""We have strong employment, wages are growing again, house
prices are at record highs and consumer confidence at boom-time
levels,"" he added. ""So we still suspect they will hike again in
August after the next inflation report.""
 The consumer price report for the second quarter is due in
late July and is likely to show inflation in the upper half of
the RBA's 2 to 3 percent target band.
 The sluggishness in retail sales for March certainly came
as a surprise to analysts who had expected a rebound of around
0.8 percent, following February's sharp 1.2 percent decline.
 SPENDING WITH CAUTION
 Thursday's data showed retail sales rose a meagre 0.1
percent in the whole first quarter when adjusted for inflation,
implying hardly any contribution to economic growth.
 That is important as retail sales account for around 23
percent of Australia's GDP and the retail sector is the biggest
employer with about 15 percent of all jobs.
 In a recent speech RBA Governor Glenn Stevens noted that
consumers were being more cautious in their spending than in
past recoveries and that might stop the economy from becoming
too hot.
 Instead, the central bank has its eyes on a coming boost
from huge rises in prices for coal and iron ore, Australia's
two biggest exports.
Thus while figures out Thursday showed Australia's trade
deficit widened in March to A$2.08 billion ($1.9 billion),
analysts expect the shortfall to narrow sharply in coming
months as those price increases feed through.
The central bank's index of Australian commodity prices this
week provided a taste of what was to come. The index surged
15.1 percent in April alone and further gains are expected as
the increases in contract prices are phased in.
 The central bank now expects Australia's terms of trade -
what it gets for exports compared to what it pays for imports -
to revisit the record highs of 2008, a marked upgrade from just
a few months ago.
 That should shower money on the economy, from profits to
investment, wages and tax receipts.
 ""The 15 percent jump in commodity prices in April should go
close to pushing the trade position back to balance, and over
time, we expect to see trade surpluses emerge,"" said Scott
Haslem, chief economist at UBS.
 That is one reason he expects interest rates to rise to
around 5 percent by year-end and further into 2011.

 * SAFE official urges flexible policies to counter inflation
 * SAFE urges increased monitoring of hot money inflows
(Adds details, background)
 BEIJING, May 6 (Reuters) - China should have no difficulty
achieving 9 percent economic growth this year but needs to beware
of mounting inflation, a statistics official said on Thursday.
 Gross domestic product expanded 8.7 percent in 2009 thanks to
massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, and most independent
economists expect an acceleration in 2010, especially after
first-quarter year-on-year growth of 11.9 percent.
 The World Bank, for example, has forecast GDP growth of 9.5
percent.
 It will be ""no big problem"" for China to grow 9 percent this
year, Pan Jiancheng, deputy director of an analysis unit under
the National Bureau of Statistics, told Reuters.
 Speaking on the sidelines of a conference, Pan said the
government should emphasise the quality of growth by improving
the structure of the economy rather than the pace of growth.
 He also said consumer price inflation could average as much
as 4 percent in 2010, surpassing the government's target of 3
percent. Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in the year to March,
but economists expect the rate to quicken in coming months.
 Wang Xiaoyi, a deputy head of the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange, agreed that the economic outlook this year was
better, but he cautioned that the foundations of recovery were
not yet solid.
 Growth was still being mainly driven by policy stimulus and
China had yet to tap its full potential for consumption growth,
Wang told a separate forum.
 Like Pan, Wang said Beijing needed to take account of rising
inflationary expectations. To that end, policy must be more
flexible.
 China also needed to step up monitoring of hot-money inflows
to prevent speculative capital from inflating asset bubbles.
 ""Overall, in 2010 cross-border capital inflows will continue
to increase on strengthening expectations for yuan appreciation,
an interest rate gap between China and abroad and also rising
asset prices,"" he said.
 Fear of an influx of speculative capital is one reason why
China has been reluctant to permit the yuan to resume a path of
gradual appreciation. The currency has been pegged near 6.83 per
dollar since mid-2008 to help Chinese exporters ride out the
international credit crunch.
 Wang said global economic prospects had improved and the risk
of a double-dip in the United States had greatly decreased. On
the other hand, recovery in Europe was uneven.
 ""Sovereign debt risks in Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland
are increasing and could possibly spread to other euro zone
countries,"" he said.
 Greece's debt woes give China reason to proceed cautiously
with currency reform, but, barring a crisis that shakes Europe,
should not stand in the way of a resumption of appreciation,
government advisers told Reuters on Wednesday. [ID:nTOE64402Z]
 Echoing the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, Wang
said the biggest risk for Asia as a whole was a surge in capital
inflows, which could inflate asset bubbles.

 SINGAPORE, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro sank to its lowest

 Japanese stocks saw their biggest percentage loss in one

 By Miral Fahmy
 SINGAPORE, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro sank to its lowest
level in over a year and stocks tumbled on Thursday as Greece's
economic woes roiled global markets and fuelled fears of a
sweeping sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone.
 European shares, which saw steep losses over the past two
days, were also opened around 1 percent lower.
 The euro fell below $1.28 in Asia, its lowest level since
March of last year, and down over 10 percent since the start of
the year. It also fell to its lowest level in two months
against the yen.
 Japanese stocks saw their biggest percentage loss in one
day since March last year, with the Nikkei average falling 3.3
percent to its lowest level in nearly two months as the market
caught up with the global selloff following a three-day holiday
this week.
 Other Asian shares fared little better, with the MSCI index
of shares outside Japan shedding 2.8 percent to its lowest
level since early March. It is also 2 percent lower so far this
year.
 ""There's no let-up in concerns that the euro zone debt
crisis could continue to worsen and as a result equity markets
across the globe remain under pressure,"" said Ben Potter,
analyst at IG Markets. ""The bull market always had to end
somewhere and it looks like this could be the trigger.""
 Analysts said investors were waiting to hear what the
European Central Bank, which holds its monthly meeting later on
Thursday, would say to assure markets that it can contain the
Greek debt crisis. The ECB is expected to keep rates unchanged
at 1 percent.
 ""The key things today are what (ECB President Jean-Claude)
Trichet says at the bank's news conference and how the supply
will go,"" a senior bonds trader said.
 ""Trichet will likely back the Greek debt deal, play down
contagion risks.""
 European leaders and International Monetary Fund chief
Dominique Strauss-Kahn have warned that Greece may be the first
of other, debt-ridden euro zone economies to suffer, putting
the economic health of the bloc at risk.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe's fate was at
stake.

up
 * Employment growth strongest in nearly two years
 * RBNZ Gov. says policy outlook in line with market view
 * Central bank rate rise in June seen a near certainty
 * NZ dollar vaults higher, swap yields jump
 By Mantik Kusjanto and Gyles Beckford
 WELLINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - New Zealand is almost certain
to start raising interest rates next month after the central
bank chief aligned policy outlook with market thinking and data
showed an unexpected improvement in the jobless rate.
 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard said on
Thursday the bank was looking at rises in small steps from the
middle of the year as the economy recovered and no longer
needed record low rates.
 The New Zealand dollar surged more than three quarters a
cent and interest rate futures and swap yields rose after the
strong jobs data convinced investors a June rate rise was a
done deal.
 ""It really cements the fact the economy has turned and the
RBNZ will start raising interest rates in June,"" said CBA
economist Chris Tennent-Brown.
 Financial markets moved to fully price in a rate hike next
month from 72 percent before the data and Bollard's speech,
according to a Credit Suisse indicator.
 The NZ dollar settled at around $0.7265/70, while two- and
three-year swap yields were 18 basis points higher, just off
the post-data highs.
 Markets earlier this year have been trimming expectations
of a June hike to below 50 percent because of mixed signals
from data, including tame inflation, a stalled housing market,
and volatile retail sales, which offset stronger consumer and
business confidence.
 However, Thursday's data showed the economy added 22,000
jobs in the first quarter, sending the jobless rate down to 6.0
percent from a downwardly revised 7.1 percent, well below a
Reuters poll forecast of 7.3 percent.
 Economists said the figures pointed to a stronger growth in
the economy in the first quarter, in contrast to weaker
expectations following a mixed set of recent data.
 ""Today's data, at face value, suggests a more robust first
quarter GDP growth than we had initially envisaged, possibly
somewhere close to fourth-quarter's 0.8 percent pace,"" said
ANZ-National senior economist Khoon Goh.
 The central bank forecast a 0.9 percent growth in the first
quarter.
 CONFIDENT RBNZ
 Bollard said the central bank's thinking was broadly in
line with markets.
 ""Financial markets currently expect the Reserve Bank to
begin raising the official cash rate around the middle of the
year and continue to do this in small steps for some time,""
Bollard said in speech notes to a local government gathering.
 ""This is broadly in line with our current views as outlined
at last week's OCR (official cash rate) review.""
 Last week, the central bank held rates at a record low 2.5
percent, but said rates will start rising in ""coming months"",
which was seen giving it the necessary flexibility to time rate
increases according to the strength of data.
 Markets raised their expectations for rate tightening over
the next 12 months to 213 basis points after the data and
Bollard's speech from 197 basis.
 ""The RBNZ has signalled hikes will be gradual, but if we
get another survey like this in three month's time, then who
knows?"" said Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs.
 The jobless rate hit a 22-year low of 3.4 percent in the
December 2007 quarter, and the tight labour market and
resulting wage pressures were factors in the central bank
lifting rates to a record high of 8.25 percent, before it
started its easing cycle in July 2008 to counter the impact of
the global crisis.
 Earlier this week, data showed wages growing at their
slowest pace in nine years in the March quarter while partial
indicators pointed to the labour market turning around.
 The National Bank of NZ's latest survey showed businesses'
hiring intentions at their highest level in five years.

 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro was pinned near one-year
lows against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, trying to find its
footing after falling through key support levels as concerns
about the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone mounted.
 The yen was the big winner, benefiting from safe-haven
inflows from investors spooked by comments from European leaders
who warned that the problems facing Greece could spread to other
countries. [ID:nSGE644093].
 The euro  was on the defensive at $1.2815, having
fallen to as low as $1.2787 as option barriers were knocked out
at $1.2800 in early Asian trade.
 The euro has now broken key support levels and the next level
is seen around $1.2550 -- its March 9, 2009 low -- with many in
the market eyeing its 2009 low of $1.2455.
 The single currency lost more than 1 percent Wednesday and
has shed more than 3.5 percent so far this week. Against the yen,
the euro was at 120.31 , having lost over 2 percent on
Wednesday as investors fled to the relative safety of the
lower-yielding yen.
 ""The focus stays on the euro as the contagion trade
persists,"" said JP Morgan in a morning note. ""Today's ECB meeting
has grown immensely in importance as the redeployment of some
form of credit crisis tools seems increasingly possible.""
 The European Central Bank holds its monthly meeting later on
Thursday and, while it is expected to keep rates unchanged at 1
percent, it should seek to assure markets that it can prevent the
Greek debt crisis spreading.[ID:nLDE6440NA]
 The ECB meet comes as the cost of insuring Greek, Spanish and
Portuguese debt against default has been rising, while Moody's
put Portugal's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade
on Wednesday. [ID:nLDE6441NZ]
 The euro's weakness was helping the dollar index hold
impressive gains this week. The index <=USD> <.DXY> was up at
84.11, not far from a one-year high of 84.31 hit earlier in the
session.
 The dollar was up marginally on the yen  at 93.90 yen,
from 93.65 yen late on Wednesday when it lost over 1 percent.
However, the dollar's rise could be capped by selling by
exporters while some traders said a fall in Asian shares could
spark another round of yen buying. Tokyo resumed trade on
Thursday after the Golden Week holidays.
 Earlier, the dollar got a boost from data showing U.S.
private sector employers added 32,000 jobs last month, bolstering
the view that U.S. interest rates will likely rise from record
lows well before action on rates in the euro zone.
 Sterling traded near five-week low against the dollar
 at $1.5097 ahead of Britain's parliamentary election,
with two polls pointing to a ""hung parliament,"".
 Meanwhile, the New Zealand dollar  jumped over 1
percent from late Wednesday to $0.7260 after Reserve Bank of New

start from mid-year. [ID:nSGE6440LH].

 * Euro could dip below $1.25 in a matter of weeks
 * Sovereign debt purchase would destroy ECB credibility
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - The unprecedented 110 billion
euro bailout package cannot prevent Greece from defaulting on
its debt and the euro may fall below $1.25 in a matter of
weeks, a senior economist at Mesirow Financial said.
 ""There's really no way Greece can make it other than
default,"" said Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist in
Chicago told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. ""I think the
bailout was the premise to go to a default of Greece.""
 Mesirow Financial, an investment firm in Chicago, had
assets under management of about $37 billion at the end of
2009.
 European officials agreed over the weekend a three-year
loan package for Greece worth 110 billion euros ($140.9
billion), but markets remain skeptical about the plan and
worried about other vulnerable euro-zone states such as
Portugal and Spain.
 The euro  fell to a 14-month low of $1.2803 on
electronic trading platform EBS on Wednesday.
 Laurenti said Greece is still spending more money than they
can afford to raise and is set to accumulate a deficit of about
50 billion euros in the next three years.
 In addition, Greece has to roll over about 70 billion euros
in debt over the coming two years, he said.
 ""That's back-of-the-envelope math. The 110 billion euros
(package) is a lot of money and it's not enough,"" Laurenti
said.
 ""I think the big mistake by the IMF (International Monetary
Fund) and Europe has been to try to fool the markets and tell
them that this is really the ending. It's not,"" he said.
 While an eventual default cannot be avoided, Laurenti said
Greece ""cannot default now"" because of the heavy exposure by
French and German banks and the risk of contagion to Spain,
Portugal, Italy and other euro zone countries.
 The EU/IMF rescue package, he said, helps European
policymakers gain some time and create a buffer and an
opportunity for the French and German banks to get out.
 ""Hopefully, the economy would be in a much better shape in
two years to absorb a Greek default than we're in now where the
recovery is still nascent and you really don't want to take a
chance,"" he added.
 EURO TO DIP BELOW $1.25
 Laurenti said he expects the euro to dip below $1.25.
""It'll be sooner rather than later. It might be a matter of
weeks,"" he said.
 Policymakers, including IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn
and the European Central Bank's Axel Weber, warned of the
dangers of contagion to other high-debt euro zone nations.
[ID:nLDE643167]
 The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and markets are
especially keen on any clues whether the ECB is moving towards
the use of its ""nuclear option"" -- a purchase of Greek and
possibly other countries' government bonds to halt the debt
crisis that is threatening the euro's survival. For more, see
[ID:nLDE6440NA]
 ""That would basically be the end of the ECB the way we know
it,"" Laurenti said. ""If the ECB were to decide to buy
(government) bonds, basically monetizing the debt of some of
these countries, it means that all the hard-won credibility and
discipline that the ECB has been trying to enforce would be
lost overnight.""
 ""If that happens, I could see easily the euro go to parity
against the dollar,"" he said.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell to a 14-month low
and world stocks slumped on Wednesday as deadly protests
against austerity measures in Athens revived fears that
Greece's struggle to repay its debts could engulf other
European economies.
 Moody's warned Portugal's debt could be downgraded but
markets recovered some ground but ended weaker.
 German bond yields fell on investor fears that a massive EU
aid package for Greece would not be sufficient to maintain
confidence in the policies of other fiscally weak euro-zone
nations. U.S. Treasury prices drifted down from their highs but
were still up on the day as investors sought a haven.
 The euro lost 1.25 percent to $1.2818 , its lowest
rate since mid-March 2009, after losing about 3.5 percent
against the greenback this week.
 Skepticism that Greece can deliver on its promises of tough
austerity measures dominated the markets. Athens vowed it would
not retreat from its measures even if it incurs a heavy
political price.
 ""The focus right now is primarily on how this is going to
play out in Europe, how much damage is going to be done,"" said
Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, in
San Francisco.
 ""How this gets resolved will tell the rest of the euro
countries that are under pressure, 'Here are the parameters for

 German bund yields hit a record low, while the cost of
protecting Portuguese government debt against default hit a
record high after credit rating agency Moody's Investors
Service said Portugal was on review for a possible downgrade.
[ID:nLDE64421G]
 U.S. stocks were weaker on the contagion fear, taking
little notice of a private sector report showing gains in the
U.S. labor market for the first time since January 2008.

 Greece's CDS levels reached a record high of 850 basis
points from 764.5 basis points at the New York close on

 The two-year Schatz yield  was spurred to a fresh

1970s.
 The 10-year Portuguese/German government bond yield spread
 widened to 310 basis points, a euro
lifetime gap.
 The equivalent Spanish spread  widened to 136

 Investors bought the government bonds on the Greece fear
factor, ignoring a report that said euro zone's economic growth
should be stronger in 2010 than previously thought.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Fear that a euro-zone debt

investors snapped up U.S. dollars.

 Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS Global
Banking & Markets, flagged $1.2330 and $1.1650 as key targets
for the euro. He said if Greece defaults or restructures its
debt, the single currency could trade as low as $1.10-$1.15. 
 The euro fell 2.3 percent to 119.96 yen  and hit
its lowest level against sterling since August . The
dollar slid 1.0 percent to 93.68 yen  but rose sharply
against nearly all other currencies, hitting one-year highs

 Sterling declined to a five-week low against the dollar

1610,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2010 03:28PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Batten down the hatches for decade of austerity," By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) -- Greece's debt crunch, for all its
peculiarly domestic and euro zone ingredients, should be an
ear-splitting alarm call for Western governments faced with one
of the biggest fiscal hangovers in history.
 The scale of the task facing governments in the United
States, Europe and Japan to return debt burdens to pre-crisis
levels of 2007 could, by some estimates, usher in a decade of
severe austerity through the teen years of the new century.
For sure, the impact of this latest episode both for Greece
itself and Europe's single currency will be profound.
 The budget squeeze needed to secure the 110 billion euro
bailout from its neighbours and the International Monetary Fund
will inevitably shrink Greeks' standard of living and sorely
test the social contract with their government.
 For the euro zone, the lack of a fiscal backstop for its
one-size-fits-all monetary policy has been badly exposed and the
delays in agreeing the rescue merely intensified the crisis.
 But while euro-sceptic voices may justifiably shout ""I told
you so"", this is hardly the time for ""schadenfreude"".
 
 CREDIT CRISIS - THE SEQUEL
 For many, this is just a snapshot of ""Credit Crisis, Part 2""
-- a sequel to the 2007/08 shock to over-borrowed households and
banks that required unprecedented government financial rescues
and dramatic easing of interest rates and credit policy.
 Goverments effectively nationalised large chunks of the
private sector debt burden in order to buy their economies time
and prevent deep recession morphing into depression.
 Now those same governments are in another race against time
to work off those debts -- treading a fine line between shock
therapy to their domestic economies and alienating nervous
global creditors.
 As Greece found out to its cost, the cat-and-mouse game with
foreign lenders can be treacherous. Any market doubt about debt
""sustainability"" could see funding costs soar and trigger what
some have termed a ""death spiral"" that feeds off itself.
But convincing creditors of debt ""sustainability"" is like
convincing them you will survive a leap from a first floor
window -- you might do, but no one's quite sure until you try.
 ""After the recent collapse in fiscal positions, simply
stabilising debt levels relative to GDP may not be enough to
placate markets,"" JPMorgan economists told clients last week.
 ""Perhaps a more reasonable path to 'sustainability' would be
to reduce the levels of debt back to their pre-crisis levels
over 10 years.""
 
 DECADE OF AUSTERITY
 The JPMorgan economists said their calculations, while
highly sensitive to growth and interest rate assumptions, showed
the task ahead for the world's major economies was daunting.
 Because the scapel is unlikely to be taken to public
finances in earnest before 2012, it worked out what primary
budget surpluses -- which exclude debt interest payments --
would be needed in the major economies to cut 2013 debt
-to-gross-domestic-product ratios back to 2007 levels by 2023.
 The upshot was the United States needed a sustained primary
surplus of nearly 4 percent of GDP for 10 years to reduce a 2013
debt ratio of 101 percent back to 2007 levels of 62 percent.
 That compares to an estimated 2010 U.S. primary deficit of
some 7 percent of GDP.
 To put it in some context, it would exceed the massive U.S.
budgetary correction after World War Two when, according to IMF
data, it took 17 years to 1963 get a bloated U.S. debt-to-GDP
ratio of 108 percent back down to 1941 levels of 42 percent.
In that correction, the primary balance averaged only 1.4
percent of GDP and was in surplus 14 of the 17 years.
 And this time around, governments have the added problem of
an expected explosion of entitlement spending as the baby boomer
generation starts retiring in droves over the next 10 years.
 It's not just the United States. JPMorgan's calculations
show Britain would need even bigger surpluses of up to 5 percent
a year for 10 years to 2023 and Japan would need a whopping
primary surplus of almost 7 percent of GDP by the same metrics.
 The euro zone as a whole -- despite big national variations
obvious in the heat felt by Greece, Portugal and Spain -- needs
a still hefty but more modest 2.7 percent primary surplus due to
the more stable position of its ""core"" in Germany and France.
 One implication of all these numbers is official interest
rates will likely need to remain as low as possible for as long
as feasible both to control parallel debt servicing and to
prevent spending cuts and taxes from clobbering the economy.
The Greek bailout gives us a glimpse of just what those
measures might look like -- slashed pension benefits, salary
freezes, extraordinary levies and steep sales tax rises.
 And while a Goldman Sachs study of big fiscal retrenchments
since 1975 showed that leaning toward expenditure cuts rather
than tax rises has been more successful in cutting debt, lifting
growth and buoying markets, it rarely happens without a push.
 ""Decisive expenditure-driven fiscal adjustments are
politically difficult to implement and tend to take place only
following a change in government and/or once bond markets force
the government's hand,"" Goldman economists concluded.
 The Greek experience should be a powerful nudge for all.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Fear that a euro-zone debt
crisis may spread beyond Greece knocked the euro below the
key$1.29 level for the first time in more than a year on
Wednesday and rattled bond markets in Portugal and Spain as
anxious investors snapped up dollars.
 The euro dropped as low as $1.2805 earlier in the session,
its weakest since March 2009, as German Chancellor Angela
Merkel warned the debt crisis could spread in Europe if a 110
billion euro ($146.5 billion) Greece rescue plan does not
succeed.
 ""We're at a fork in the road,"" she told German lawmakers.
""This is about nothing less than the future of Europe, and with
it the future of Germany in Europe.""
 Kenneth Broux, market economist at Lloyds Banking Group in
London, said $1.25 is ""the next big level on the downside.""
 Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS Global
Banking & Markets, flagged $1.2330 and $1.1650 as key targets.
He said if Greece defaults or restructures its debt, the single
currency could trade as low as $1.10-$1.15.
 In afternoon trade in New York, the euro was last down 0.9
percent at $1.2858. Over the last three days, it has lost more
than 3 percent against the dollar, its worst performance since
shedding 3.9 percent over a similar period in January 2009.
 It briefly pared losses versus the dollar after the German
parliament's budget committee approved a draft law on Germany's
contribution to a financial aid package for Greece.
 The euro fell 1.5 percent to 120.97 yen and hit its lowest
level against sterling since August. The dollar dipped 0.6
percent to 94.03 yen but rose sharply against nearly all other
currencies, hitting one-year highs earlier against the Swiss
franc and a basket of currencies.
 Sterling declined to a five-week low against the dollar at
$1.5068 ahead of Britain's parliamentary election on Thursday,
with two polls pointing to a ""hung parliament,"" but the
currency regrouped to $1.5122, little changed from late
Tuesday.
 EYES ON IBERIA
 Anxious investors sold European stocks and drove up the
cost of insuring Greek, Spanish and Portuguese debt against
default, while taking refuge in the dollar.
 Moody's put Portugal's credit rating on review for a
possible downgrade on Wednesday.
 ""Contagion fears are driving the market and add to pressure
on the euro, as does the ongoing civil unrest in Greece that
may make it hard to institute reforms,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The protests in Greece turned violent, and three people
were killed in Athens when demonstrators set fire to a bank to
protest planned tax increases and cuts to wages and pensions.
 US ECONOMY ON THE MEND?
 The dollar got a boost after data showed U.S. private
employers added 32,000 jobs last month, bolstering the view
that U.S. interest rates will likely rise from record lows well
before action on rates in the euro zone. Investors also looked
ahead to the government's key monthly report on non-farm
payrolls, due Friday.
 ""The dollar is the safe haven of first choice."" said BNY
Mellon currency strategist Michael Woolfolk. ""This is a market
that is looking for any excuse to sell the euro. Good news out

 * Progress on giant African free trade bloc
 
 DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Reuters) - East Africa's economic bloc
of five nations is optimistic a trade deal with the European
Union can soon be agreed, the secretary-general of the East
African Community (EAC) said on Wednesday.
 The EAC and the European Union have been at loggerheads for
months over signing the so-called Economic Partnership Agreement
(EPA), which was designed to replace preferential trade deals
the World Trade Organisation has struck down.
 EAC members Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda
initialled the EPA deal in 2007 and secured EU market access.
But the countries have refused to sign the agreement, meaning
there are no legally binding commitments. 
 The deal was meant to be signed last July, but the deadline
passed due to haggling over trade and development issues.
 ""My understanding is that they are coming round to
accommodating us as far as the development issues are concerned,
so we see a very positive way forward in concluding the
framework agreement,"" EAC Secretary-General Juma Mwapachu told
Reuters.
 The EU said in February it wanted a clear timetable for
signing the deal, but Tanzania's trade minister said then the
EAC would not budge unless Brussels gave firm commitments on
development assistance, especially for infrastructure.
 The EAC has a gross domestic product of $73.3 billion and a
population of close to 127 million. It has a customs union, and
a common market is due to take effect in July.
 
 GRAND FREE TRADE ZONE
 The region's biggest economy, Kenya, stands to lose most if
the EU deal is not signed as it is excluded from the
classification of a Least Developed Country. 
 The other four could still send goods to the EU under the
Everything But Arms initiative. But Kenya has pledged to support
its partners in pushing for the issues to be resolved.
 Mwapachu also said there had been some progress on forming a
giant African free trade zone linking the EAC, the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa).
 ""Everything is now documented on the grand free trade area,
rules of origin and all those things. We are now trying to
organise a tripartite summit,"" he said on the sidelines of the
World Economic Forum in Tanzania.
 Mwapachu said the summit would be held once the current
chairs of the three blocs -- Tanzania, Democratic Republic of
Congo and Zimbabwe -- had fixed a date and an announcement would
be made at the meeting on the establishment of the area.
 Last year, the three blocs agreed a roadmap for the zone,
paving the way for a free trade area covering 26 countries, more
than half a billion people and economies with a combined gross
domestic product of $650 billion.
 Many African leaders see greater regional economic
integration as key to helping the world's poorest continent
develop as it will open up huge markets and hopefully encourage
more foreign direct investment.

 * Businesses stress market of 1 billion consumers
 * Continued policy reform important for growth
 
 By Matthew Tostevin
 DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Reuters) - Africa will emerge from the
global downturn more quickly and strongly than much of the
world, but must shift policies and attitudes still further to
benefit fully, business and political leaders said on Wednesday.
 ""We've come through it better than most and we've done that
not because we're not integrated in the global economy but
because we are,"" Maria Ramos, CEO of South African bank Absa,
told a session at the World Economic Forum (WEF) for Africa.
 ""There has been a big amount of reform of this continent
over the past decade and a half.""
 The world's poorest continent has defied the direst
predictions that it would suffer more than others as a result of
the global woes and the World Bank this week upgraded its growth
forecast for sub-Saharan Africa to 4.2 percent in 2010 versus
1.7 percent last year.
 In addition to rising commodity prices and investment from
faster growing Asian countries, policy reforms and debt relief
over the past decade have put many African countries on a more
stable footing and better placed to attract investment.
 Businesses in Africa talk up the potential of 1 billion
consumers with ever increasing spending power and point to the
explosion of mobile phone services as a sign of what can be
done.
 Results of a survey of CEOs by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed
77 percent of those in Africa were optimistic for the next three
years compared to only 50 percent globally.
 
 OPPORTUNITY
 ""We as Africans need to understand this opportunity,"" South
African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan told Reuters.
 ""That's what this WEF is about and to fashion our thinking
in a way in which we can take advantage of the opportunities
that are there,"" he said, while stressing that the rest of the
world also needed to understand Africa's emerging importance.
 The fact Africa's biggest annual business gathering is being
held in Tanzania rather than South Africa, as it usually is, was
a sign of the growing importance of the countries outside the
continent's biggest economic power.
 But the east African country's own record on economic
reforms has been looking patchy of late. Over two years, it
slipped 20 places on the World Bank's ease of doing business
survey to 131 out of 183.
 President Jakaya Kikwete acknowledged this week that more
needed to be done, but he told the summit that laws to promote
investment by foreign countries were not enough by themselves.
 ""We need the support of the governments of these countries,""
he said, stressing in particular the difficulties created by
foreign agricultural subsidies which put African farmers at a
disadvantage.
 Despite setbacks in some countries, business groups and
donors believe that continuing reforms to open up economies and
increase political freedoms are an important driver of growth.
 ""The political will is coming,"" said Omari Issa, who heads
the Investment Climate Facility for Africa, which runs dozens of
projects to help countries make it easier for businesses to
operate and to eliminate red tape.
 ""We are creating competition between countries and within
countries, competition between agencies. I think the formula is
working,"" he told Reuters.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Fears of contagion from the
Greek debt crisis knocked the euro to a 14-month low and sent
world stocks reeling as violent protests erupted over Athens'
austerity measures turned deadly and Moody's warned Portugal's
debt could be downgraded.
 Markets retraced ground from the day's lows but were still
weaker in midday U.S. trade.
 German bond yields surged on investor fears that a massive
aid package would not be sufficient to ensure other fiscally
weak euro-zone nations don't spiral down. U.S. Treasury prices
drifted down from their highs but were still up on the day.
 The euro lost 0.72 percent to $1.2887 , its lowest
point since mid-March 2009. It is down roughly 3.5 percent
against the greenback this week.
 Skepticism that Greece can deliver on its promises of tough
austerity measures dominated the markets.
 ""European contagion is really the name of the game. That's
all we're watching,"" said Rick Klingman, managing director of
Treasury trading at BNP Paribas in New York.
 German bund yields hit a record low, while the cost of
protecting Portuguese government debt against default hit a
record high after credit rating agency Moody's Investors
Service said Portugal was on review for a possible downgrade.
 U.S. stocks were weaker on the contagion fear, taking
little notice of a private sector report showing gains in the
U.S. labor market for the first time since January 2008.

 OTTAWA, May 5 (Reuters) - Greece's debt crisis is not a

 * Barroso - market mood not fundamentals influenced ratings
 * Comments follow warning of new EU controls on sector
 
 By John O'Donnell
 BRUSSELS, May 5 (Reuters) - The president of the European
Commission has criticised what he called the deficient work of
credit rating agencies, saying they let the dark mood in
financial markets cloud their judgement.
 Jose Manuel Barroso's remarks, the harshest such criticism
from the powerful EU executive, come amid growing frustration
among senior officials with rating agencies for downgrading
Greece as it teetered on the edge of financial collapse.
 Barroso's remarks followed a stark warning earlier in the
week from Michel Barnier, the European commissioner in charge of
an overhaul of financial services, and further boosted the
chances of tougher European controls of the sector.
 ""Deficiencies in their working methods has led to ratings
being too cyclical, too reliant on the general market mood
rather than on fundamentals - regardless of whether market mood
is too optimistic or too pessimistic,"" Barroso told lawmakers in
the European parliament on Wednesday.
 The head of the European law-making executive signalled that
further controls could be introduced for the industry.
 These would go beyond new rules that start later this year
which require the agencies to explain how they arrive at the
ratings that can determine a country's financial survival.
 ""We have also launched a reflection on whether further
measures may be needed to ensure the appropriate rating of
sovereign debt in particular,"" he said.
 In his role as president of the executive for 27 European
countries, Barroso has significant power in deciding how rating
agencies are allowed to do business.
 Earlier in the week, Barnier had warned credit rating
agencies to watch their step when judging a country's financial
health, saying the commission would probe how they work and
could even set up a central agency to take on their job.
 Barnier signalled his dissatisfaction that just three
companies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- dominate
the industry.
 Debt-laden Greece, which was last weekend bailed out by a
110 billion euro ($147 billion) rescue from European neighbours
and the International Monetary Fund, has been marked down to
junk status by S&P and now hovers close to Pakistan in the
credit stakes.
 Rating agencies had been blamed for carelessness in the run
up to the global crash, handing out over-generous ratings on the
packets of mortgage and consumer debt that subsequently
unravelled, sending the economy into a spin.

 Analysts said some are wondering whether the European

buy euro zone government debt to relieve pressure on countries
hit by contagion fears. However, unnamed sources quoted by
Market News International said officials were reluctant to take
that step. [ID:nLDE6441O8]

1620,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2010 12:00PM ET</span>",Greek aid costs Germany's Merkel support --poll," BERLIN, May 5 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's
conservatives have lost support nationally since Greece appealed
for a bailout from European partners, a new poll showed on
Wednesday, just five days before an important regional election.
Merkel's conservative camp, made up of her Christian
Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU),
fell 2 percentage points from the previous week to 34 percent,
the Forsa poll for Stern magazine showed. Her Free Democrat
(FDP) coalition partners were unchanged at 8 percent. 
 The poll was conducted between April 26 and 30, a few days
after Greece called on fellow European Union countries and the
International Monetary Fund for emergency loans. 
 Euro zone states last weekend triggered a multi-billion-euro
rescue that includes a 22.4-billion euro ($29.06-billion) loan
from Germany's KfW state-owned bank and federal guarantees.
 German voters are fiercely opposed to footing the bill for
Greece and Merkel has been widely criticised for procrastinating
for too long, a move which some argue undermined market
confidence and pushed up the cost of aid.
 ""It is different from the banking crisis a year and a half
ago. The chancellor has not been a pillar that gives people
confidence and direction in the crisis,"" said Manfed Guellner,
head of Forsa pollsters.
 ""Then she said the aid package was not for banks but for
people, but last week, she failed to find such a good
formulation,"" he added.
 On Sunday, Merkel faces her first electoral test since
forming a coalition with the FDP some six months ago. 
 An election in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW)
could rob her of a majority in the upper house of parliament
with her FDP coalition partners. This would in turn stall her
policy programme, including tax cuts and health reform.
 The Forsa poll also showed Merkel's personal popularity
levels down 6 percentage points from the previous week at 48
percent. Only 41 percent of those asked said her crisis
management was good or very good. 
 The poll put the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) up 1
percentage point at 25 percent and the Greens at 16 percent, up
2 percentage points.

 * Says markets must not be playground for speculation
 
 BRUSSELS, May 5 (Reuters) - European Commission President
Jose Manuel Barroso launched a fierce attack on financial market
speculation on Wednesday and said the EU executive could move
quickly to further regulate them if they acted irresponsibly.
 Barroso made his comments in a speech to the European
Parliament after a European Union-International Monetary Fund
aid package for Greece failed to appease concerns on markets
that Athens' debt problems could spread to other countries.
 ""The Commission will do whatever necessary to ensure that
financial markets are not a playground for speculation,"" Barroso
said. ""We will ... act swiftly if further regulation is
required.""
 He said financial services must realise that they are a
service and not an end in itself, and must not become detached
from their economic and societal function.
 Euro zone countries and the IMF are ready to lend Greece 110
billion euros over the next three years to help it finance
itself while overhauling its bloated public finances.
 But markets doubt Greece is determined enough to see through
huge budget deficit cuts. Three people were killed in a fire in
central Athens on Wednesday after protesters marching against
austerity measures threw petrol bombs into a local bank branch.
 ""Free markets constitute the basis for the functioning of
successful economies. But free markets need rules and
compliance, and rules and compliance need to be tightened if
irresponsible behaviour puts at risk what cannot be at risk,""
said Barroso, the head of the EU executive.
 He said euro zone heads of state and government would
complete approval of the aid deal for Greece at talks in
Brussels on Friday.
 ""We will also look beyond this deal into what we need to do
to draw the right lessons from this situation,"" Barroso said.
 He said EU budget rules and compliance with them must be
strengthened and differences in the competitiveness of the 16
countries that use the euro must be reduced.
 The euro zone should also have a permanent mechanism for
dealing with disruptive situations such as the Greek debt
crisis, he said.
 ""The responsibility shown by the governments needs to be
matched by financial market players,"" he said.
 The 10-year Portuguese/German government bond yield spread
 widened on Thursday to a euro
lifetime gap of 310 basis points on rising market concern that
Greece's debt crisis could spread to Portugal and Spain.
 The equivalent Spanish spread  widened to 136
bps, also a euro lifetime wide. 
 The increase in the spread generally means higher borrowing
costs on the financial markets for the countries concerned and
is a sign of market concern.

 * Fail to agree on broader-based measures
 * United political front fails to materialise
 
(Updates with details, comment, background)
 By Axel Bugge
 MADRID, May 5 (Reuters) - Spain's Socialist government
reached a deal on Wednesday with the main opposition party to
unblock stalled plans to merge regional savings banks which are
under threat from a property market bust.
 Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, struggling to
convince markets Spain is not going to need a bailout like
Greece, said he had agreed with centre-right Popular Party
leader Mariano Rajoy to push for details of mergers to be
available by June 30.
 The savings banks, known as cajas and largely unlisted and
with close links to regional governments, are disproportionately
exposed to Spain's sagging property market, both via property
loans and loans to struggling property developers.
 The government set aside a fund of up to 99 billion euros
last year to help the banks consolidate, but so far there has
been no progress, largely due to rivalries between regions
controlled by different political parties.
 With this obstacle removed, a restructuring seen by the Bank
of Spain as essential if the Spanish banking system is to
weather steadily rising non-performing loans should be able to
proceed.
 ""The important thing is that there is agreement between the
main political parties,"" Zapatero told journalists after his
first formal meeting with Rajoy since 2008.
 ""We have reached two agreements, ... firstly, to facilitate
the (banks') restructuring process and secondly ... to propose a
reform of savings banks legislation,"" Rajoy told reporters.
 Cleaning up the cajas, and thereby stimulating bank lending,
is vital for reviving Spain's economy, which has had seven
consecutive quarters of economic contraction as it struggles
with lack of competitiveness and a post-boom legacy of private
sector debt.
 
 HUGE PROPERTY EXPOSURE
 On the other hand, if losses in the financial system mount,
bond market doubts over Spain's ability to cut its budget
deficit -- already strained, especially with Spanish
unemployment at 20 percent, the highest rate in the euro zone --
will increase still further.
 The Socialist government has promised to reduce the budget
deficit to below the EU limit of 3 percent of GDP by 2013 from
11.2 percent last year with measures including a hike in
value-added tax.
 Spain's financial system, including both big listed banks
and the cajas, had about 445 billion euros of loans to the
property sector on its books at the end of last year, according
to the Bank of Spain, equivalent to close to half of Spain's
GDP.
 Raj Badiani, analyst at IHS Global Insight, said the
agrement was welcome, even if partial.
 ""It's positive as reforms cannot become bogged down in
political in-fighting, even if much work needs to be done.
Markets want to see rapid action on reforms and anything that
can be done to speed them up is welcome,"" Badiani said.
 Zapatero and Rajoy also agreed on new legislation for
savings banks to increase capital by issuing shares with voting
rights, a measure to be carried out within 3 months. This is
aimed at reducing political control over the cajas in the
future.
 Still, Spanish financial markets slumped again on Wednesday
as fears over the euro zone's peripheral economies persisted.
The stock market was down 3.5 percent and the spread on Spanish
10-year government bonds over German Bunds was at 134 basis
points, a euro life-time high.

 * Choice of finance minister is key to market credibility
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Already jumpy because of the Greek
crisis, markets could swiftly punish sterling if they sense
policy paralysis after Thursday's parliamentary election.
 Some London trading desks will be manned overnight as
results come in, with gilts traded from 1 a.m. local time (0000
GMT). Some Asian currency dealers will also be watching results
in the early hours of Friday.
 If political parties need to negotiate a coalition, the
clock will be ticking. British politicians are more accustomed
to one party having a commanding majority.
 ""They do not have to agree on everything, just to work
together,"" said Eurasia Group analyst Wolfango Piccoli.
 ""The maximum time horizon would be a week, but they would
need to reassure markets over that time. The key thing will be
managing expectations.""
 If the opposition Conservatives fail to win a majority but
are comfortably the largest party -- for example with more than
300 seats in the 650-seat lower house -- then they are seen
likely to try to rule as a minority, probably with the support
of Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionists.
 Markets will be jumpy on Friday if a coalition seems
necessary, but might be willing to offer a day's grace,
particularly if policymakers make reassuring sounds about a
willingness to work together.
 But if by Monday, May 11 no government has been formed and
speculation is turning to new elections or weeks of
horsetrading, worried investors may head for the doors as the
politicians play for power. That in itself could call time on
the negotiations.
 In a real sterling emergency, the Bank of England would have
the option of raising rates on Monday at its monthly meeting,
delayed from this week by the election. But few see that as
likely.
 
 ALL ABOUT SPEED
 A growing number of analysts and financial houses suggest a
broad-based coalition might be more willing to push through
painful cuts than a fragile majority -- although most still say
an outright Conservative win would be best for markets. The
issue is speed, given market nerves.
 ""It is quite possible to suggest that a coalition emerging
from a hung parliament could push through fiscal consolidation
faster than a small majority Conservative government,"" said
David Owen, managing director and chief European economist at
Jefferies. 
 ""The question is whether markets would give it enough time.""
 Sterling and gilts could also benefit from Greece, rising
against the euro on European troubles and shrugging off issues
at home -- although the FTSE would likely track global market
sentiment and continue to suffer the Eurozone's woes.
 There are multiple scenarios as to how coalition
negotiations could play out. Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown,
Conservative leader Cameron or even Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg
could all have a chance of the top slot, or an internal Labour
coup could usher in new contenders.
 The Liberal Democrats could form a coalition or provide
external support to a minority government.
 None of those options would necessarily terrify investors.
Indeed, who emerged as finance minister from such negotiations
might ultimately prove more important for market credibility.
 A Reuters poll of economists showed Conservative business
spokesman Ken Clarke their favoured choice, followed by Labour
finance minister Alistair Darling and Liberal Democrat finance
spokesman Vince Cable. Conservative finance spokesman George
Osborne, often accused of inexperience, was fourth. 
 The greatest market risk might follow any emergency
post-election budget. If that failed to convince and prompted
negative moves from credit ratings agencies, it could prompt a
much wider sell-off.
 ""The absolute worst thing for a new government would be a
ratings downgrade after the budget,"" said Eurasia Group's
Piccoli. ""I don't think it would cause the government to
collapse, but it would be terrible for its credibility and could
prompt another reshuffle.""

1625,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2010 11:05AM ET</span>",SNAP ANALYSIS-Greek riots to weaken resolve for measures,"By Dina Kyriakidou
 ATHENS, May 5 (Reuters) - Greek protesters set fire to a
bank, killing three people, on Wednesday in the most violent
reaction to date to the government's austerity plan.
 Groups of masked youths hurled petrol bombs, stones and
sticks at riot police as nearly 50,000 striking workers and
public servants marched to parliament, where a bill dictating
pay cuts and tax hikes was due for debate.
 Eyewitnesses said marchers chanted ""Thieves!"" and hurled
water bottles at riot police, who had formed a cordon around the
parliament building in central Athens, reflecting increasing
anger among ordinary people at politicians.
 Here are some of the implications for Greece:
 
 PROTEST SET TO WEAKEN GOVERNMENT RESOLVE
 The ruling socialists, who came to power in October pledging
to tax the rich and help the poor, are keenly aware of the need
to sustain public support in imposing harsh austerity measures.
 Opinion polls, which showed solid support for the government
through the early months of the crisis, are registering
increasing public discontent.
 The socialists are bound to tread more lightly in imposing
some of the reforms for fear more violent protests may
completely derail their plans to cut the deficit by 30 billion
euros.
 This may complicate some fiscal efforts, targets may be
missed and Greece may eventually be forced to restructure its
300 billion euro debt despite a 110 billion euro international
aid injection under a eurozone/IMF deal.
 
 FORCING SOCIAL JUSTICE
 The biggest protest since the December 2008 riots that
helped bring down the outgoing conservatives, are bound to prod
the government to satisfy public demands for social justice.
Most of the slogans chanted by tens of thousands condemned
corruption and demanded those responsible for the crisis are
punished.
 Prime Minister George Papandreou has promised to revive the
state through meritocracy and transparency but no politician has
been brought to justice during his seven months in office over
the economic crisis or years of scandals.
 After Wednesday's protests, the government can no longer
brush aside calls for justice if it wants to pursue tough
belt-tightening measures. Any further delay in bringing top
financial criminals and corrupt politicians to justice will fuel
further protests in the months to come.
 
 MARKET REACTION 
 News of the deaths rattled investors, with Greek stocks
falling by almost 4 percent and the euro losing ground to the
U.S. dollar.
 Markets have been sceptical about whether the plan to bail
out Greece can prevent a default, in a crisis shaking weak
economies on the eurozone's periphery. They are closely watching
Papandreou's struggle with angry unions and leftists to sustain
the painful austerity steps.
 This comes on top of concerns about whether the Greek
economy, mired in a deep recession and characterised by a lack
of competitiveness, can survive the austerity measures and
remain in the euro zone, where it cannot devalue its currency or
control its own interest rates.
 Such violent protests not only cast doubt on the austerity
plan but slow down an economy in dire need of a boost.

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Fear that a euro-zone debt
crisis may spread beyond Greece sent the euro tumbling below
$1.29 for the first time in more than a year and rattled bond
markets in Portugal and Spain as investors snapped up dollars.
 The euro plunged to $1.2805, its lowest level since March
2009, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned of contagion if
a 110 billion euro ($146.5 billion) Greece rescue does not
succeed.
 ""We're at a fork in the road,"" she told German lawmakers.
""This is about nothing less than the future of Europe -- and
with it, the future of Germany in Europe.""
 Kenneth Broux, market economist at Lloyds Banking Group in
London, said traders are gunning for $1.25 as ""the next big
level on the downside.""
 The euro was last at $1.2855, down 0.9 percent. Over the
last three days, it has lost 3.5 percent against the dollar,
its worst performance since shedding 3.9 percent over a
three-day period in January 2009.
 ""It's tough to see a bottom,"" said Joe Manimbo, a trader at
Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. ""There are
deep-seated concerns about the situation in Greece and overall
fiscal health in Europe.""
 The euro also fell 1.4 percent to 121.09 yen and hit its
lowest level against sterling since August. The dollar fell 0.4
percent to 94.25 yen but rose sharply against nearly everything
else, hitting one-year highs against the Swiss franc and a
basket of currencies.
 EYES ON IBERIA
 Anxious investors also cut exposure to European stocks and
drove up the cost of insuring Greek, Spanish and Portuguese
debt against default, while taking refuge in the dollar.
 While not in as parlous a bind as Greece, both Spain and
Portugal have high budget deficits and have become targets of
speculators who consider them the next weakest links in the
16-country euro zone.
 Moody's said Wednesday it put Portugal's credit rating on
review for a possible downgrade, and yields on short-dated
Portuguese debt soared.
 ""Contagion fears are driving the market and add to pressure
on the euro, as does the ongoing civil unrest in Greece that
may make it hard to institute reforms,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 US ECONOMY ON THE MEND?
 The dollar got an added boost after data showed U.S.
private employers added 32,000 jobs last month, bolstering the
view that U.S. interest rates will likely rise from record lows
well before rates in the euro zone.
 But analysts said the data was really just an added
incentive for investors to do what they've been doing for
weeks: buy dollars.
 ""The dollar is the safe haven of first choice."" said BNY
Mellon currency strategist Michael Woolfolk. ""This is a market
that is looking for any excuse to sell the euro. Good news out
of the U.S. or bad news out of Europe, take your pick.""
 Analysts said the market is starting to speculate the
European Central Bank could announce plans to buy euro zone
government debt at a meeting on Thursday to relieve pressure on
countries hit by contagion fears.
 Unnamed sources said the central bank remained reluctant to
make the move, Market News International reported.
 ""You can't rule out the possibility the ECB could institute
new measures, and that would amount to monetary easing, which
is not good for the euro,"" Dolan said.

(Adds detail, background)
 By Nina Sovich and Marie Maitre
 PARIS, May 5 (Reuters) - Veolia and Caisse des Depots (CDC)
have finalised a deal to merge their transport assets but may
wait until 2012 to list the new company, signalling continued
frailty in the French IPO market.
 The initial public offering (IPO) of the new group was
originally envisaged for late this year, but last month CDC
Chief Executive Augustine de Romanet raised the possibility the
listing would be delayed.
 The group's bourse debut could now come anytime between the
first quarter of 2011 and the start of 2012, Antoine Frerot,
chief executive of Veolia and future president of the new
transport company, told a news conference on Wednesday.
 Market volatility due to the Greek crisis has strained the
already thin IPO market in France, bankers say. With little
ability to predict the market, it is increasingly difficult to
value companies or predict their future growth.
 ""There was a glimmer of light last winter, but over the last
couple of weeks darkness has returned. I don't see much activity
this year,"" said one Paris-based investment banker
 The banker blamed stock market swings and the Greek crisis
for difficulty in listing companies.
 The listing is contingent on regulators in Brussels
approving the deal and good market conditions, CDC's de Romanet
said, declining to comment further on the delay.
 The deal, originally unveiled last June, will involve the
tie-up of Veolia Transport and Transdev, which is 70 percent
owned by CDC, creating a company with 8 billion euros ($10.4
billion) in annual revenue.
 Veolia is listing the transport assets to focus on its core
waste and environment business and shift some debt off its
balance sheet, analysts said.
 
 FRENCH CHAMPION
 ""You can IPO anything you want. It's just a matter of
price... This (company) isn't a large cap. This helps. It's
easier to IPO a smaller company,"" said John Honore, an analyst
at Societe Generale.
 He estimates the listed company will probably be worth about
2 billion euros.
 A banker familiar with the deal said the transport business
was still big enough to offer big institutional investors the
security of liquidity.
 ""These days 2 billion euros is quite a lot. This will draw
institutional investors,"" he said.
 Veolia's transport business is going up against newly
emboldened competitors. In late April, Germany's Deutsche Bahn
sealed a takeover of Britain's Arriva, creating Europe's largest
transport group.
 The merger could trigger a wave of transport consolidation
across the continent and was the impetus behind creating a
French transport champion, analysts have said.
 The French group will have 117,000 staff in 28 countries and
an operating cash flow of around 500 million euros. It will seek
to develop its business mainly in Germany, the Netherlands,
Britain and the United States.
It also expects annual sales to be 6 percent higher by 2015,
de Romanet said.
Veolia will become the industrial operator of the new group
and CDC a long-term strategic shareholder. Each will hold a 50
percent stake in the new entity.

 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The looming threat of a hung
parliament resulting from Thursday's UK general election has
compelled market strategists to again chop their outlook for the
pound against the dollar, the latest Reuters poll showed.
 With polling stations opening in a matter of hours and
Britain's bookmakers still odds-on for no party winning a clear
majority, forecasters scaled back their 6- and 12-month
sterling/dollar predictions for the fifth month running.
 They also saw a one-in-five chance that Britain would suffer
a credit rating downgrade sometime after the election.
 Cable is seen treading water near its current level of $1.51
for the next six months, according to median forecasts from 58
foreign exchange strategists, before strengthening slightly to
$1.53.
 This was weaker than the 12-month forecast of $1.55 from
April's poll.
 ""We expect GBP to weaken until mid-year,"" said Kamal Sharma
from JP Morgan.
 ""Sterling's strength over the past month has been driven by
a sense of economic recovery which still looks premature for a
country facing a post-election fiscal tightening.""
 All three of Britain's biggest political parties agree that
steep cutbacks are needed to shrink Britain's vast budget
deficit down to size, even if they differ over when they should
take effect.
 But a lack of detail about how they will manage this and the
risk that a weak minority or coalition government will struggle
to legislate budget cuts has given some cause to believe the UK
will lose its ""AAA"" top-notch credit rating.
 The 35 economists polled by Reuters who answered an extra
question assigned a median 20 percent chance of this happening
sometime after the election.
 ""A downgrade is improbable, but a decision to review the AAA
rating carries as much as an 80 percent probability, which
should drive GBP lower as the realities of fiscal discipline
will hit the ruling party,"" said Ashraf Laidi from CMC Markets.
 Ratings agency Moody's said last month that a hung
parliament would not necessarily hurt Britain's credit rating
given the political consensus over the need to cut the deficit
of just under 12 percent of GDP for the 2009/10 financial year.
 The final Reuters/Ipsos MORI published on Monday showed the
opposition Conservatives gaining ground in key parliamentary
seats and could gain a narrow but outright win on Thursday.

 EURO DIPPING
 The pound is likely to appreciate modestly against the euro
over the next 12 months, according to the poll.
 The UK economy exited recession in the last quarter of 2009
and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said last month the British economy was expected to
outperform many of its euro zone peers.
 But Greece's debt crisis has been of particular detriment to
the euro in the last five months, having exposed vulnerabilities
in other overborrowed euro zone countries and even calling into
question the viability of the European currency project itself.
 The euro hit a 9-month low against sterling on Wednesday at
85.54 pence and median forecasts from the poll showed the euro
weakening to 84.7 pence in 12 months' time.
 Economists gave just a 10 percent median probability of
sterling reaching parity with the euro within six months.
 ""GBP itself has a lot of bad news priced into it ... and the
markets have perhaps yet to fully discount the risks of a
prolonged slide in the EUR based on the fiscal challenges facing
the euro zone in the next few years,"" said TD Securities' Shaun
Osborne, the most accurate forecaster in 2009 Reuters polls.
 An additional fillip to sterling could come from an interest
rate hike from the Bank of England later this year that would
narrow the interest rate differential with the European Central
Bank and improve the pound's appeal against the euro.
 Last week's Reuters BoE poll showed a slim majority of
economists expecting a rate hike by the end of this year from
their record low 0.5 percent.
 Forecasters in the European Central Bank rate poll showed a
much firmer expectation that it would wait until 2011 before
raising interest rates from 1 percent.

 * Euro seen at $1.28 in a year
 * Sterling seen gaining ground vs. euro
 
 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro will struggle over the
coming year, according to the latest Reuters foreign exchange
poll which again saw analysts paring back forecasts for the
battered common currency as the Greek debt crisis rumbles on.
 The poll of 58 analysts, taken April 29-May 5, predicted the
euro would slide to $1.28 in a year, under the one-year low of
$1.2936 it knocked earlier on Wednesday and 2 cents below the
April poll consensus forecast. In February's poll the euro was
seen at $1.40 in a year.
 The poll saw cuts across the board for one-, three-, and
six-month forecasts with fears about contagion in the euro zone
gripping investors.
 The one-month forecast was cut to $1.32 from $1.34 last
month while the six-month forecast dropped to $1.29 from $1.32.
The euro has fallen almost 9 percent from an intraday peak for
the year of just under $1.46 struck in January.
 ""Our outlook for the euro remains negative. We recently
adjusted our euro forecasts, essentially pulling our
already-weakening euro forecasts a quarter forward while looking
for additional weakness in 2011,"" said Meng Jiao at BofAML.
 ""The current Greek debt crisis has made explicit the core
problems within the euro zone -- having a common currency and
monetary policy but very different fiscal and labour market
policies.""
 European finance ministers triggered a record 110 billion
euro ($147 billion) bailout for debt-stricken Greece on Sunday
after Athens committed itself to years of painful austerity
measures.
 Investors fear the country's economic woes may spread to
other vulnerable euro zone members such as Spain and Portugal.
But a Reuters poll last week gave only a median 9 percent chance
that Greece would leave the 16-nation bloc.
 
 POUND STAMP ON EURO
 In the second half of last year the euro zone economy
emerged from its worst post-war recession but is expected to do
little more than tick over in coming quarters.
 Economists polled by Reuters earlier this month expected the
bloc's economy to grow 1.0 percent this year and 1.5 percent
next. Consensus predictions showed inflation will remain below
the ECB's two percent target ceiling until at least 2012.
 The European Central Bank is not expected to move rates from
their record low of 1.0 percent until next year at the earliest
to maintain the muted growth path which contrasts far more
buoyant growth expected in the United States.
 ""Upbeat fundamentals leave the dollar with the upper hand --
at least in the short term,"" said Niels Christensen at Nordea.
 Against sterling the euro was seen losing ground as the Bank
of England unwinds its loose policy and begins to raise rates
earlier than the ECB.
 Cross rates calculated by Reuters show it trading at 87
pence in one month and then weakening to 85 pence in a year. The
currencies nearly reached parity at the end of 2008 but
economists gave only a 10 percent probability they would do so
again within six months.
 Euro volatility against the dollar was seen rising to 10.7
percent over the coming month, compared to actual volatility of
9.8 percent last month. Analysts say the divergence of forecasts
in Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator of exchange
rate volatility in the following month.

 MADRID, May 5 (Reuters) - Spain's opposition leader Mariano
Rajoy said he has agreed with Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero to speed up reform of the country's banking sector
after a meeting on Wednesday.
 ""We have reached two agreements, ... firstly, to facilitate
the (banks') restructuring process and secondly ... to propose a
reform of savings banks legislation,"" Rajoy told a news
conference after meeting with Zapatero.
 Many of Spain's unlisted savings banks are undercapitalised
after overstretching during a property boom which burst two
years ago. Reform of the sector has been slow as promises to
merge have not materialized amid political wrangling.
 Support by Spain's opposition leader is key for the ruling
Socialists, which rule with a minority in parliament.
 Up to now, the two leaders have been unable to renconcile
political differences over how to manage the economic crisis,
even as unemployment pushes up towards 20 percent.
 Rajoy said the two had agreed on a plan for savings banks to
increase capital by issuing shares with voting rights.
 The meeting has been the focus of much attention as Spain
was hit in recent days by fears of contagion from the Greek debt
crisis as investors worried about its large budget deficit and
its slow recovery from its worst recession in decades.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro hit a one-year low
against the dollar on Wednesday on concerns Greece's debt
problems could spread to other economies such as Spain and
Portugal.
 Fears the euro zone debt crisis may not end with Greece
cranked up risk aversion and added to safe-haven demand for the
dollar, pushing it to its highest against a currency basket
since May 2009.
 In European trade, the euro slid to $1.2928, according to
Reuters data, after Germany and the International Monetary Fund
warned of financial contagion unless the crisis is stopped in
Greece. [ID:nSGE644093]
 At 1102 GMT, the euro  was down 0.4 percent on the day
at $1.2932.
 The cost of insuring Spanish and Portuguese debt against
default rose on Wednesday, and analysts said contagion fears
would keep the euro pressured.
""The questionable way the Greek crisis has been handled and
concerns about the peripherals are weighing on sentiment. I
expect euro weakness to remain in place,"" said Kenneth Broux,
market economist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""I see $1.25 as the next big level on the downside,"" he
said. 
 Investors remain highly sceptical Greece will be able to
deliver the tough austerity measures it promised in return for a
110 billion euro aid package from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund. [ID:nLDE6430PO]
 Highlighting selling pressure on the euro, the head of the
German's exporters' association said on Wednesday markets may
drag the single currency down to parity against the dollar by
the end of the year. [ID:nBAE003778]
 The euro has fallen roughly 3 percent so far this week and
is poised to post a loss for the week of more than 3 percent,
which would be the biggest weekly loss since March 2009.
 The single currency showed little reaction to euro zone
services sector data which indicated that the economic recovery
has momentum. [ID:nSLA4GE62T]
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback
against a basket of six currencies, was 0.4 percent higher at
83.606, after climbing to 83.649, its highest since May 2009.
 ""The dollar is winning largely by default as the other side
of the euro trade,"" said Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy
at RBC Capital Markets.
 
 BROAD EURO LOSSES
 Analysts said the $1.2880-85 level in the euro -- a low hit
in April 2009 -- would be the next target, and a breach of that
area would open the way for a test of $1.25, a level not seen
since March 2009.
 Technical analysts highlighted support at $1.2930, the 78.6
percent retracement of the 2008-2009 rally.
 The euro also fell to its weakest against the pound in
nearly nine months on Wednesday, stumbling to 85.45 pence
, according to Reuters data, down about 0.2 percent
on the day.
 Sterling faces its own test this week in a tightly contested
parliamentary election on Thursday, from which markets are
concerned no clear winner will emerge. [ID:nLDE6430DK]
 The U.S. currency gained 0.2 percent on the yen to 94.75 yen
, edging close to an eight-month high of 94.99 yen struck
on Tuesday. However, talk of option barriers at 95 yen capped
the dollar's rally.

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales fell
short of market expectations in March on a month-on-month basis
signalling continued weakness in consumer demand that is likely
to leave exports as the main growth engine.
 European Union statistics office Eurostat said retail sales
in the 16 countries using the euro were flat month-on-month in
March and 0.1 percent lower than in the same period of 2009.
 Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected a 0.2
percent monthly increase and a 0.5 percent year-on-year fall.
 ""It means private consumption is still not a driver of the
recovery. It means we will have to stick to export-driven
recovery for a while,"" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING.
 The European Commission forecast on Wednesday that euro zone
growth would be stronger than previously forecast this year at
0.9 percent rather than 0.7 percent expected in February, mainly
thanks to stronger external demand for euro zone exports.
 The Commission estimated that euro zone economic growth in
the first quarter of 2010 was 0.1 percent quarter on quarter and
that it would be 0.4 percent in the second quarter.
 It is then likely to slow down to 0.2 percent
quarter-on-quarter the third quarter and accelerate to 0.3
percent in the last three months of 2010, the Commission said. 
 Consumer demand is weak because unemployment in the euro
zone is at an 11-year high of 10 percent and expected to rise
further, which keeps a lid on wage growth and limits households'
spending power.
 This also reduces inflationary risks in the economy. 
 The European Central Bank, which wants to keep inflation
below but close to 2 percent, meets on interest rates on
Thursday amid strong market expectations that it will keep
interest rats at record lows of 1 percent.
 ""There remains a compelling case for the ECB to keep
interest rates down at 1.00 percent not only at its May policy
meeting on Thursday but also for many more months to come,"" said
Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 ""We expect the ECB to hold off from raising interest rates
until 2011 and to tread very lightly over the coming months in
withdrawing its emergency liquidity measures,"" he said.
 The European Commission forecast that euro zone inflation
would be 1.5 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2011.

completely unified approach to the Greek debt crisis, which
markets fear could spread to other countries in the euro zone.
 Following are comments made over the last 24 hours:
 
 EU MONETARY AFFAIRS CHIEF OLLI REHN
 ""In order to safeguard the economic recovery, which is still
rather modest and somewhat fragile, it's absolutely essential to
contain the bushfire in Greece so that it will not become a
forest fire and a threat to financial stability for the European
Union and its economy as a whole.""
 ""We are not going to propose (an aid mechanism for Spain)
because there's no need to propose financial assistance.""
 ""All euro zone member states are taking measures to
consolidate their public finances, Spain and also Portugal.""
 ""In the next two years, Greece will not have to resort to
private financing, up to 2012, but the funding by the euro
member states and the IMF will cover fully Greece's financing
needs up to 2012."" 
 ""We assume Greece should be able gradually to return to the
financial market. Still beyond 2012, we will partly cover the
financial needs of Greece if needed."" 
 
 IMF HEAD DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN
 ""There is always a risk of contagion.""
 ""Portugal has been mentioned, but it is already taking
measures and the other countries are in a much more solid
situation ... but we should remain vigilant."" 
 ""I think the rate at which the Europeans lent should have
been equal to that of the IMF, which is lower by more than half
a point.""
 ""I think we could have made a greater effort, because a less
expensive lending rate (we have), the more we help the Greeks.""
 Greece had been ""on the edge of bankruptcy and soon it
would not have been able to pay its civil servants"".
 
 GREEK FINANCE MINISTER GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU
 ""Any form of debt restructuring is out of the question.""

 YANNIOS PANAGOPOULOS, LEADER OF GREEK UNION GSEE
 ""With our strike today, we are continuing our fight against
harsh and unfair measures that hit workers, pensioners and the
unemployed.""
 ""Our struggle is also a message to the people of Europe that
what started in Greece will soon spread because Europe has shown
it is incapable of confronting this crisis.""
 
 GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL
 ""We're at a fork in the road.""
 ""This is about nothing less than the future of Europe -- and
with it the future of Germany in Europe."" 
 ""There is no alternative to the aid to be agreed for Greece
if we want to secure the financial stability of the euro area.""
 ""It must come, to avoid a chain reaction in the European and
international financial system and the risk of contagion of
other euro member states.""
 Merkel said Europe would have to tighten its budgetary rules
in future to prevent other countries going the way of Greece.
 ""Those (EU states) that don't meet the Maastricht criteria
then forfeit a part of their structural funds or agricultural
funds. And that means, in the case of long-running deficit
sinners, the withdrawal of voting rights, at least temporarily.""
 
 JOCHEN SANIO, HEAD OF BAFIN, GERMAN MARKET WATCHDOG
 ""Speculators are waging a war of aggression against the euro
zone.""
 
 SPANISH PRIME MINISTER JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ZAPATERO
 ""Complete madness."" (of a market rumour that his country
would ask for 280 billion euros in aid from the euro zone). 
 
 DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MARIA TERESA FERNANDEZ DE LA VEGA
 ""The Spanish economy is reliable. We will meet our deficit
target.""
""There is no risk of any contagion effect from Greece. The
fears are unfounded. We will continue to do our homework in
terms of meeting our commitments.""
 
 ECONOMY MINISTER ELENA SALGADO
 ""The markets have a speculative component ... the Greek
situation has exaggerated that component and, simply, the
markets have not believed that the plan we have put into place
to save the situation in Greece will provide the results that we
think it will.""
 ""In the next few days we have to prove it."" 
 
 ECB GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER AXEL WEBER
 ""A Greek default in the current very fragile situation would
pose a substantial risk to the stability of monetary union and
the financial system.""
 ""There is a threat of serious contagion effects for other
euro zone countries and increasing negative feedback effects for
capital markets."" 
 ""It is decisive that the (aid) programme is tied to strict
conditions, which will be checked quarterly.""
 
 FINNISH FINANCE MINISTER JYRKI KATAINEN
 ""The markets have not calmed down ... because they fear that
national parliaments will not approve the package.""
 ""The second risk is that Greece's parliament will not
approve the economy repair plan and the third is how strong are
the other countries, that is, is there a risk of spreading, even
if loans were granted?""

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth should
be stronger this year than previously thought and the budget gap
lower, the European Commission said, but it warned of risks to
recovery from financial market tensions sparked by Greece.
 In its twice-yearly economic forecasts for countries of the
27-nation European Union, the bloc's executive said economic
growth in the 16 countries using the euro would be 0.9 percent
this year, rather than the 0.7 percent it projected in February.
 This is because stronger global growth is likely to drive
demand for euro zone exports, the Commission said. 
 But tension on sovereign-bond markets, triggered by concern
over the ability of Greece to pay back its debts, could derail
the recovery if it spreads to other euro zone countries with
large deficits and slow growth -- Portugal or Spain, Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
 ""In order to safeguard the economic recovery, which is still
rather modest and somewhat fragile, it's absolutely essential to
contain the bushfire in Greece so that it will not become a
forest fire and a threat to financial stability for the European
Union and its economy as a whole,"" Rehn told a news conference.
 ""The euro area is taking care of the Greek case. I'm
confident we will succeed to turn things around concerning
Greece,"" Rehn said.
 The euro zone and the International Monetary Fund have
promised Greece 110 billion euros ($146.5 billion) in loans that
will allow the debt-stricken country not to ask markets for
credit for around two years while it overhauls public finances.
 ""I'm confident that the figure of 80 billion euros from euro
zone states and 30 billion from the IMF will suffice for the
financing needs of Greece for the next two years,"" Rehn said.
 Markets have been speculating that Portugal and Spain might
also need emergency loans, but Rehn dismissed such talk.
 
 NO AID FOR SPAIN 
 ""We are not going to propose (an aid mechanism) because
there's no need to propose financial assistance,"" Rehn said.
""All euro zone member states are taking measures to consolidate
their public finances, Spain and also Portugal.""
 The euro zone's combined budget shortfall this year is
likely to be 6.6 percent of the single currency area's gross
domestic product rather than the 6.9 percent forecast by the
Commission in November last year, against 6.3 percent in 2009.
 The aggregate deficit is to fall in 2011 to 6.1 percent of
GDP, still more than twice the EU limit, the Commission said, as
growth would accelerate to 1.5 percent next year.
 The euro zone debt-to-GDP ratio is seen reaching 84.7
percent this year compared with 78.7 percent in 2009 and
increasing further to 88.5 percent in 2011, the Commission said,
slightly raising its November 2009 forecasts.
 The cut-off date for the data in the latest projections was
April 20, which means they do not take into account the latest,
higher estimates of Greece's budget deficit and debt in the
coming years.
 Rehn stressed, however, that the share of the Greek economy
in the euro zone was so small that the change in forecasts for
Greece did not affect the aggregate total.
 The Commission forecast that Greece would have a budget
deficit of 9.3 percent in 2010 and 9.9 percent in 2011 unless
policies changed. On May 2, Greece announced an agreement with
the euro zone in which it projected the deficits at 8.1 percent
and 7.6 percent respectively.
 The Commission said euro zone inflation -- which the
European Central Bank wants to keep just below 2 percent over
the medium term -- would be 1.5 percent this year and 1.7
percent in 2011. 
 Previously the Commission said euro zone inflation would be
only 1.1 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2011.
 ""The remaining slack in the economy is likely to keep both
wage growth and inflation in check, partly offsetting an assumed
increase in commodity prices,"" the Commission said.

* Offshore sentiment high, locals more wary
 * Bonds attract most interest
* Business confidence up but consumers demand a concern

(Adds business confidence index)
 JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Reuters) - South African financial
market investor confidence jumped and business confidence rose
on a continuing rebound in sentiment after the global slowdown
and last year's recession, surveys showed on Wednesday.
 The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SACCI)
said its business confidence index (BCI) rose to 84.2 points in
April from 83.2 in March.
 SACCI said most domestic indicators had advanced beyond
their lower turning points but low levels of household
consumption were a key economic constraint.
 Consumer spending has continued to decline due to high debt
levels and about a million jobs lost since the start of 2009.
 In an effort to boost local demand, the central bank has cut
interest rates by a cumulative 550 basis points since December
2008.
 A separate survey showed investor sentiment was at its
highest since the second quarter of 2007, just before the U.S
subprime crisis hit.
 The Maxim-ETM Investor Confidence Index (ICI) jumped to a
2-1/2 year high of 105.9 points in the first quarter from a
revised 94.4 in the previous three months, and 64.7 a year
before when sentiment was still weak after the global financial
turmoil.
 ""The latest ICI reading is indicative of the major
turnaround in confidence brought about by global monetary
stimulus and bailouts,"" market analysts ETM said in a statement.
 Africa's biggest economy pulled out of its first recession
in 17 years in the third quarter of last year after the global
slump hit factories and exports. The central bank slashed its
repo rate to 6.5 percent to try to boost growth.
 ETM said the bulk of the confidence was driven by offshore
investor sentiment, evident in large capital inflows into local
stocks and bonds as international liquidity improved.
 However, local investors were still wary, preferring to
shift from cash into bonds rather than into equities.
 ""Bonds remain the big winner in terms of fund allocation and
with strong offshore inflows in the bond market, falling
inflation, and affirmation by the ratings agencies of South
Africa's sovereign credit rating, bonds are likely to keep
benefiting,"" it said.
 According to exchange operator JSE Ltd data, foreigners have
been net buyers of 30.1 billion rand ($4.05 billion) in bonds,
and 12.5 billion rand of stocks so far this year.
 ETM said fund allocations to stocks increased slightly in
the quarter after dipping in the previous three months.

government has pledged to contribute to an aid package for
debt-stricken Greece, dropping earlier resistance to help.

articles in influential German newspapers on Greece and the euro
zone crisis:
 
 DIE WELT (centre-right)
 ""For Germany, it is a week of destiny. The gigantic aid
package that is being put into motion radically changes the
nature of the European currency union. The most broad-reaching
political decision in Europe since the introduction of the euro
is taking place without a public debate, according to the wishes
of the government: the participation of parliament is a pure
farce, as the people's representatives have no real room to

 ""Time and again Finance Minister Schaeuble assures us that
there is no alternative to aid for Greece. The stability of the
euro can only be secured in this way. With great pathos, the CDU
politician practically transforms the highly controversial

supposedly only secure within the European family.
 ""No one can seriously promise that the fresh money can
prevent a Greek bankruptcy and debt rescheduling... If Athens
collapses within a few months, not only will taxpayer money be
lost, but belief in politics will be definitively damaged.
 ""There are good political and economic reasons for believing
the current path to be false. It is not really proof of
solidarity to chain the Greeks to a currency that requires
stability measures which massively overstrain them and strangle
their tattered economy. In turn, the European scepticism that
has grown throughout the crisis could blow up into pure rage if
the common currency weakens in the newly created transfer union.

 FINANCIAL TIMES DEUTSCHLAND (Business)
 Comment from Wolfgang Muenchau
 ""A new scandal is brewing over Greek aid, again as a result
of double-dealing by government heads. Markets are getting
signals that the agreed credit will have so-called junior
status. That means if Greece goes bankrupt ... holders of Greek
state bonds will be paid back first and only if there is
anything left, will European governments get their money back.
 ""The public is not being told about this. IMF money is
traditionally super-senior -- that means high on the priority
list. I had assumed the same would apply to euro zone
governments .. but I have heard the IMF and EU loans will enjoy
junior status. That would be an absolute scandal.
 ""The question of the seniority of debt is relevant.
 ""German lawmakers should ask about this and refuse to agree
(to the aid) if they do not get clear answers.
 ""Euro zone states are playing the same deceitful game
Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to play for so long to overcome
the Greek aid question.
 ""So here is my call to German lawmakers: please give us
clarity about the status of the EU and IMF credit.""
 
 BILD (centre-right, mass circulation)
 ""The wave against the financial aid for Greece is rolling!
 ""Yesterday, Bild printed an open letter to all members of
parliament and asked: ""Dear politicians, would you personally
guarantee the billions for the Greeks?
 ""Now the first Bild readers have sent their lawmakers the
letter - it has been downloaded on the internet many thousands
of times!
 ""Among politicians, too, despair about the billions of aid
is growing. FDP finance expert Frank Schaeffler said: 'I don't
want to vouch for this and do not agree with the Greece aid. The
package won't work: Greece will have more debt when the EU plan
has run out than today.'
 ""Lutz Knopek (FDP): 'I am sceptical as to whether the Greeks
are serious about implementating the savings programme.'
 ""Both will vote against the credit package on Friday, and
members of the conservatives (Chancellor Angela Merkel's camp)
are also expected to vote against it.""
 
 FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (conservative)
 ""The Greek drama would be easier to bear if the federal
government would stop taking the people for fools. Finance
Minister Schaeuble and Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef
Ackermann are rushing to get a 'significant and positive
contribution' from the banks to help Greece.
 ""In fact, the banks come out unscathed ... provided
governments avert a bankrupt Greece with the help of the
taxpayer... They also want to draw loans from the state bank,
which is guaranteed by the federal government, a win-win for
banks -- for there are no safer bonds. 
 ""How about a little honesty for a change? The fathers of the
monetary union feared the euro would weaken if countries
borrowed too much at each other's expense. That is why they
forbid countries being liable for each others' debts.""

 By Carolyn Cohn
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to eight-week
lows and the euro hit one-year troughs on Wednesday as fears
that Greece's debt crisis will spread to other weak euro zone
members drove investors to the safety of U.S. and German bonds.
 Markets were clearly unimpressed with the 110 billion-euro
aid package agreed for Greece over the weekend by the European
Union and International Monetary Fund and are sceptical the
country can deliver on its promises of tough austerity measures.
 Debt insurance costs for Portugal and Spain have continued
to rise while shares in Spain and Portugal, two of the weaker
euro zone members, fell 2 percent, the latter at the lowest
since July 2009. 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares pared
losses slightly thanks to strong results by market bellwethers
like Societe Generale. 
 But the sovereign debt fears eclipsed the corporate
earnings, keeping the index near two-month lows and down 0.4
percent on the day.
 The euro, which suffered its steepest one-day loss since
last June on Tuesday, notched up another one-year low at $1.2928
according to Reuters data.
 In Athens, striking public sector workers challenged
Greece's bailout-for-austerity deal, while policymakers,
including IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the European
Central Bank's Axel Weber, warned of the dangers of contagion to
other high-debt euro zone nations.
 ""The questionable way the Greek crisis has been handled and
concerns about the peripherals are weighing on sentiment. I
expect euro weakness to remain in place,"" said Kenneth Broux,
market economist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""I see $1.25 as the next big (euro) level on the downside.""
 The euro has fallen about 3 percent this week. It displayed
no response to upbeat services sector data that suggests the
euro area economic recovery has momentum..
 World stocks as measured by MSCI fell half a percent to
their lowest since early March, while the more volatile emerging
equities index fell 1.5 percent.
 Asian markets also weakened. Shanghai's key index fell as
much as 2 percent to its lowest in seven months, suffering from
Beijing's weekend moves to tighten policy.
 U.S. equities are poised to open lower, with S&P 500 futures
and the Nasdaq100 futures down 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones
industrial average futures eased 0.2 percent.
 
 DOLLAR THE WINNER
 Investors took shelter in the dollar and benchmark U.S. and
German government bonds. 
 The dollar index was steady after gaining 1.4 percent on
Tuesday, its biggest daily gain this year, and the U.S. currency
tested eight-month highs against the yen near 95.
 Two-year German Schatz yield hit a record low, while the
10-year German Bund yield touched the lowest since mid-January
2009. Benchmark Treasury yields were at the lowest in almost
three months.
 ""(Euro zone) periphery is widening so that's given a bid to
Bunds. There's absolutely no market in anything apart from
Germany,"" one bond trader said. ""It's all about contagion fears
spreading in all the markets.""
 Oil extended losses towards $82 per barrel, following the
steepest one-day percentage loss in three months on Tuesday, on
rising inventories and a firm dollar.
 Gold also came under pressure as the dollar strengthened.
 Portuguese debt insurance costs rose to 360.7 basis points
in the five-year credit default swap market, one of the highest
levels in Europe, according to CDS monitor CMA DataVision.
Spanish 5-year CDS edged up to 211.8 bps.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2010 04:08AM ET</span>","EU exec sees stronger euro zone 2010 growth, lower deficit"," By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, May 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth is
likely to be stronger thus year than previously thought and the
budget deficit should be lower, the European Commission said,
but warned of risks from sovereign bond market tensions.
 In its twice-yearly economic forecasts for countries of the
27-nation bloc, the European Union executive arm said economic
growth in the 16 countries using the euro would be 0.9 percent
this year, rather than 0.7 percent it forecast in February.
 This is thanks to stronger global growth which is likely to
drive demand for euro zone exports, the Commission said.
 ""We must now ensure that growth will not be derailed by
risks related to financial stability,"" Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement.
 ""The EU recovery continues to be surrounded by high
uncertainty, illustrated by the recent tensions in
sovereign-bond markets,"" the Commission statement said, adding
risks to the forecasts were broadly balanced. 
 Financial markets are concerned about the ability of Greece
to service its large debt obligations and to overhaul its public
finances and institutions.
 Markets also warily eye other euro zone countries, such as
Portugal, Spain and Ireland -- which have large budget deficits
and relatievly low growth -- for signs of the Greek debt crisis
spreading there.
 ""A successful completion of the financial support to Greece
can be expected to increase investor and consumer confidence,""
the Commission said.
 The euro zone's combined budget shortfall this year is
likely to be 6.6 percent of the single currency area's gross
domestic product rather than 6.9 percent forecast by the
Commission in November last year, against 6.3 percent in 2009.
 The aggregate deficit is to fall in 2011 to 6.1 percent of
GDP, still more than twice the EU limit, the Commission said, as
growth would accelerate to 1.5 percent next year.
 Euro zone debt to GDP ratio is likely to reach 84.7 percent
this year from 78.7 percent in 2009 and increase further to 88.5
percent in 2011, the Commission said, slightly raising its
November 2009 forecasts.
 But the cut-off date for data to the latest projections was
April 20, which means they do not take into account the latest,
higher than before estimates of Greek budget deficits and debt
in the coming years.
 The Commission forecast that Greece would have a budget
deficit of 9.3 percent in 2010 and 9.9 percent in 2011 unless
policies change, but on May 2 Greece announced an agreement with
the euro zone in which it projects the deficits at 8.1 percent
and 7.6 percent respectively.
 The Commission said euro zone inflation -- which the
European Central Bank wants to keep below but close to 2 percent
over the medium term -- would be 1.5 percent this year and 1.7
percent in 2011. That is far below the ECB target.
 Previously the Commission said euro zone inflation would be
only 1.1 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2011.
 ""The remaining slack in the economy is likely to keep both
wage growth and inflation in check, partly offsetting an assumed
increase in commodity prices,"" the Commission said.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2010 04:08AM ET</span>",Euro zone April services PMI hints at recovery momentum," * Services PMI revised up slightly, high since Oct 2007
 * No revision to composite PMI
 * Markit says suggests 0.6 percent GDP growth in Q2
 
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro zone services sector grew
at a slightly faster pace last month than initially thought, a
survey showed on Wednesday, further supporting indications that
the region's recovery from a deep recession has momentum.
 The upbeat report suggested that the financial crisis that
has gripped Greece and has stoked speculation about the
financial health of other smaller euro zone countries so far has
not dealt a major blow to overall economic activity.
 The report also pointed to only minimal economic impact from
the plumes of volcanic ash from an erupting Icelandic volcano
that paralysed much of European airspace for several days during
the month.
 Markit said it revised up its final services sector
purchasing manager's index (PMI) to 55.6 from 55.5, which marked
a sharp rise from 54.1 in March and showed the fastest rate of
services growth since October 2007.
 Growth in the 16-member euro area's biggest economy,
Germany, accelerated, and French services growth bolted higher
after a setback earlier in the year. Italian services growth
slowed slightly from March as did laggard Spain.
 The composite PMI, which provides a broader read of economic
activity in a survey panel of 4,500 companies that also includes
manufacturers, was left unrevised at 57.3, well above the 50.0
mark that splits growth and contraction.
 If sustained at that level, it would point to robust
economic growth in the second quarter, Markit said.
 ""The final data confirm the message from the earlier flash
estimate that euro area GDP could exceed current consensus
forecasts in Q2, expanding by as much as 0.6 percent,"" said
Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson.
 But he said Greece -- which represents a tiny share of
overall euro zone GDP -- remained a concern, with firms
reporting that export sales are being lost as an increased rate.
 The report also suggested that downward price pressures in
the euro zone were abating. The output prices index for the
services sector was revised up to 48.3 from 47.8.
 The composite prices charged index was also revised up to
50.2 from 49.7, although driven primarily by manufacturing. That
was the first reading showing output price inflation since
October 2008.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a one-year
low on Wednesday, after tumbling in Asia as fears euro zone debt
problems could spread spooked investors, while the dollar
benefited from rising risk aversion.
 The single currency slid to its lowest level since April
2009 with analysts and traders citing that month's low of
$1.2880-85 as the next target.
 A breach of that level would open the way for a test of
$1.25, a level not seen since March 2009.
""The questionable way the Greek crisis has been handled and
concerns about the peripherals are weighing on sentiment. I
expect euro weakness to remain in place,"" said Kenneth Broux,
market economist at Lloyds Banking Group.
 ""I see $1.25 as the next big level on the downside,"" he
said. 
 At 0727 GMT the euro was trading down 0.1 percent at
$1.2963. It shed more than 1.5 percent on Tuesday, its steepest
one-day loss since last June, on concerns Greece's debt problems
would spread to other so-called peripheral economies such as
Spain and Portugal.
 It has lost nearly 3 percent this week, as investors remain
highly sceptical Greece will be able to carry out the tough
austerity measures it promised in return for a 110 billion euro
aid package from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund.
 Technical analysts highlighted support at $1.2930, the 78.6
percent retracement of the 2008-2009 rally.
 Spreads between benchmark German Bunds and Portuguese and
Spanish bonds widened further on Tuesday.
 The two-year Greek bond yield had surged by more than 400
basis points to over 16 percent in one its biggest one-day gains
since the Greek debt crisis erupted earlier this year.
 The euro also fell to its weakest level against the pound in
nearly nine months on Wednesday, stumbling to 85.51 pence,
according to Reuters data, down about 0.2 percent on the day.
 Sterling faces its own test this week in a tightly contested
national election on Thursday, from which markets are concerned
no clear winner may emerge.
 The dollar index rose 0.3 percent to 83.549, after climbing
as far as 83.649, its highest level since May 2009, benefiting
from safe-haven demand.
 ""There are no real safe havens out there at the moment but I
guess the market will be looking at the dollar as the best of
the worse bunch,"" said Greg Gibbs, FX Strategist at Royal Bank
of Scotland in Sydney.
 It gained 0.3 percent on the yen to 94.98 yen, pressuring an
eight-month high of 94.99 yen struck on Tuesday, with talk of
option barriers at 95 yen capping rallies.
 Traders said the dollar was also supported by signs the U.S.
economy was on the mend. Data released on Tuesday showed pending
U.S. home sales rose 5.3 percent in March while factory orders
rose 1.3 percent. Both numbers beat forecasts.

 * Trade tools can help clean up the sector
 * Illegal logging threat to efforts to fight climate change
 By David Fogarty, Climate Change Correspondent, Asia
 SINGAPORE, May 5 (Reuters) - Illegal logging in Indonesia,
a leading timber exporter, is threatening jobs in the U.S.
forest products industry and undermining efforts to use forests
to fight climate change, a report by U.S. labour and green
groups says.
 The report, ""Illegal logging in Indonesia, the
environmental, economic and social costs"", lists numerous steps
the country has taken to curb illegal logging but says much
more needed to be done to end the corruption and demand that
drives the trade.
 ""Illegal logging undermines the strength and sustainability
of the forest products' economy both in Indonesia and the
United States,"" says the report by the BlueGreen Alliance,
Sierra Club, United Steelworkers, Rainforest Action Network and
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 The practice by Indonesia and other nations distorted
global prices of timber, undercut sustainably manufactured
products and jeopardised the jobs of U.S. workers, the report
says.
 ""Under current conditions, there is no level playing field.
Manufacturers across the U.S. are struggling to compete against
imported, illegally harvested low-priced wood and wood
products,"" it says.
 Citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, it says the
logging, wood, paper and cabinetry industries had lost 242,000
jobs, or roughly 23 percent of its workforce, since 2006.
 U.S. industry losses due to illegal logging-related
depressed wood prices and lost exports had been estimated at
more than $1 billion, the report added.
 The authors called for steps to reform the harvest, trade
and purchase of wood and wood products and said it was crucial
the United States was not complicit in perpetuating illegal
logging by allowing access to U.S. markets.
 ""Trade and investment agreements should end demand for and
trade in wood products that are illegally and or unsustainably
sourced,"" it said.
 For example, official recognition that non-enforcement of
Indonesian forestry laws was an unfair trade subsidy would also
help curb illegal logging, the authors say.
 TRANSPARENCY
 Indonesia has stepped up efforts to fight illegal logging
and to curb deforestation. Steps include banning the exports of
round and rough-sawn logs and asking the Corruption Eradication
Commission to investigate graft and logging-related crimes.
 But the report cites lax enforcement of existing forestry
and anti-corruption laws as hindering the fight against illegal
logging and calls for much greater transparency in tracking the
origin of timber and timber products.
 It also says the majority of logging in Indonesia was still
illegal. A spokesman for country's forestry department
disagreed. ""We admit there is still illegal logging but it
doesn't mean all logging is illegal,"" said Masyhud, who goes by
one name.
 Deforestation is also a major source of greenhouse gas
emissions and Indonesia's national climate change council says
the country is one of the world's top carbon emitters because
of deforestation and forest fires.
 The country's tropical forests cover a vast area and rank
only behind Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in
Africa in area, acting like lungs of the atmosphere.
 The government has pledged to cut the growth of its
greenhouse gas emissions by curbing deforestation and promoting
a U.N.-backed scheme that aims to reward developing nations for
saving their forests.
 Projects that preserve and rehabilitate large tracts of
forest can earn money through the sale of carbon credits to
rich nations trying to meet mandatory carbon cuts at home. The
money is meant to flow to investors, local communities and
government.
 But the report warned against a rush of investment into the
scheme, called reducing emissions from deforestation and
degradation, or REDD, saying poorly designed and managed
projects could leave forests vulnerable to further destruction.

 PARIS, May 5 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's
chief said there was a risk of the Greek debt crisis spreading
to the rest of Europe, but there was no real threat for big
countries, including France and Germany, a French newspaper
reported on Wednesday.
 ""There is always a risk of contagion,"" Dominique
Strauss-Kahn told Le Parisien newspaper. ""Portugal has been
mentioned, but it is already taking measures and the other
countries are in a much more solid situation ... but we should
remain vigilant.""
 Strauss-Kahn said under the terms of the deal the plan will
be monitored every three months, but if the measures were not
taken the international community ""might have to step aside,""
although there was no suggestion that would happen.
 Renewed selling gripped euro zone financial markets on
Tuesday as concerns mounted that the record 110 billion euros
EU/IMF rescue package for Greece would not stop a debt crisis
spreading to other weak euro zone members.
 There was no real risk for France and Germany, or other big
European countries, Strauss-Kahn said without specifying.
 The IMF chief said the Greek aid plan had a primary goal to
save Greece faced with too much debt and too weak
competitiveness.
 ""It was in the edge of bankruptcy and soon it would not
have been able to pay its civil servants."" Strauss-Kahn said,
in his first interview since the debt deal was struck.
 He dismissed any suggestions of Greece or any other
European country pulling out of the euro zone, calling any such
move the ""end of the euro.""

 TOKYO, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro sank to a new one-year
low on Wednesday, with its sell-off deepening as fears about
contagion in the euro zone gripped investors, while the dollar
was the chief beneficiary of the rising risk aversion.
 The dollar hit a one-year high against a basket of six big
currencies <.DXY> and climbed to its strongest since last May
against the Swiss franc as share markets around Asia lost
ground.
 The euro notched another one-year low at $1.2936 ,
with analysts and traders citing $1.2880-85 as the next target,
the low of April last year, and a breach there seen as opening
the way for a test of $1.25, a level not seen since March 2009.
 The euro shed more than 1.5 percent on Tuesday, its
steepest one-day loss since last June, and broke through key
support around $1.3000, fuelled by concerns that Greece's debt
problems would spread to other economies such as Spain and
Portugal.
 ""The euro is now on a clear downward trend and that's quite
entrenched now,"" said Gregg Gibbs, FX strategist at Royal Bank
of Scotland in Sydney.
 ""There are no real safe-havens out there at the moment but
I guess the market will be looking at the dollar as the best of

 The single currency struggled at $1.2952 at 0500 GMT, down
0.3 percent on the day.
 It has lost nearly 3 percent just this week, as investors
remain highly sceptical Greece will be able to carry out the
tough austerity measures it promised in return for 110 billion

 Spreads between benchmark German Bunds and Portuguese and
Spanish bonds widened on Tuesday, while the cost of insuring
against a Greek default rose. The two-year Greek yield surged
by more than 400 basis points to over 16 percent in one its
biggest one-day drops since the Greek debt crisis erupted
earlier this year.
 The euro also fell to its weakest level against the pound
in nearly nine months, stumbling to 85.54 pence ,
according to Reuters data, down about 0.2 percent on the day.
 ""That will have the market thinking about further falls in
euro/sterling, targeting initially perhaps around 84.50 or the
lows in the middle of last year around 84,"" Gibb said.
 Sterling was flat against the dollar at $1.5137 
after falling to its lowest in a month below $1.5100 on
Tuesday. It faces its own test this week in the form of tightly
contested national elections on Thursday in which markets are
concerned there may be no clear winner. [ID:nLDE6430DK]

 Fears about the spread of Greece's debt crisis have driven
investors to the safety of the Japanese yen and the U.S.
dollar, considered safe-haven investments when risk aversion
spikes.
 ""Everything really depends on what news flow comes out of
Europe over the next few days,"" said Gareth Berry, currency
strategist at UBS in Singapore. ""Our analysis shows people are
not just short-covering, they have been buying the dollar for
the past couple of weeks.""
 The dollar index rose 0.3 percent to 83.567, after climbing
as far as 83.649, and the greenback was up 0.2 percent at
1.1052 Swiss francs  after touching 1.1075 francs.
 It gained 0.2 percent on the yen to 94.73 yen ,
although it stopped short of an eight-month high of 94.99 yen
struck on Tuesday, with talk of option barriers at 95 yen and
exporter offers around there expected to limit gains.

Greece
 By Simon Rabinovitch and Aileen Wang
 BEIJING, May 5 (Reuters) - Greece's debt woes give China
good reason to proceed cautiously with currency reform, but,
barring a crisis that shakes Europe, should not stand in the
way of a resumption of appreciation, government advisers said
on Wednesday.
 Chinese officials have steadfastly argued that global
uncertainties argue against a big rise in the yuan's exchange
rate, a position that the Greek worries are serving to
underline.
 ""China has to take the global economic environment into
consideration in reforming the yuan's exchange rate. The Greece
crisis will definitely have an impact, but, overall, it
shouldn't be that big,"" said Ding Zhijie, a professor at the
University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.
 ""First and foremost, the focus for yuan reform is still on
China's own needs,"" said Ding, who advises the government.
 Beijing has held the yuan steady at about 6.83 to the
dollar since mid-2008, an attempt to cushion its economy from
the global financial crisis that has faced heavy foreign
criticism.
 With Chinese inflation accelerating and exports recovering,
many economists have predicted that the government could
unshackle the yuan before the end of June, around the time of a
Sino-U.S. summit this month or a G20 meeting next month.
 Investors have been betting on about a 3 percent yuan rise
over the next year, though expectations for appreciation have
weakened this week on fears that an international rescue
package for Greece could fall short of what is needed.
 STILL ON COURSE
 But Zhang Yansheng, head of the economic research institute
under the National Development and Reform Commission, a
powerful planning agency, said the European turbulence would
not blow Beijing off course.
 ""China will carry out yuan reform exclusively according to
its own plan. The pace of reform will not be overly affected by
external factors such as the Greek debt crisis,"" he said. ""The
cost of labour, land and resources are the key factors for
China to consider when implementing yuan reform.""
 Economists at China International Capital Corp, the
country's largest investment bank, said in a note to clients
this week that the government was likely to let the yuan rise
this quarter as part of a moderate tightening of monetary
policy.
 But these plans could be upset if Greek debt troubles take
a turn for the worse and contaminate other European countries,
they added.
 MUTED CRITICISM
 For the time being, China appears to have reaped a
political dividend from Greece's woes.
 Earlier this year, with the worst of the financial crisis
seemingly in the past, China faced a barrage of calls from
abroad to abandon its de facto currency peg. This criticism has
been more muted recently.
 When European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso
visited Beijing last week, he emphasised that China had
confidence in the euro rather than to question its yuan policy.
 It does not hurt that the yuan has strengthened steadily
since late last year in trade-weighted terms, tracking the
dollar higher against most currencies.
 However, this will not make China complacent and the
government is still focused on how to reform its currency
regime, said Ding of the University of International Business
and Economics.
 ""Pressure for yuan appreciation will remain, but the source
of that pressure will change. As the global economic structure
changes, it will not just be developed nations, but also
developing nations that want this,"" he said.
 ""China will have to be proactive in confronting this,
including starting up yuan appreciation again.""

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro sank to fresh one-year
lows on Wednesday, with its sell-off deepening as fears about
contagion in the euro zone gripped investors, while the dollar
was the chief beneficiary of the rising risk aversion.
 The dollar hit a one-year high against a basket of six
major currencies and climbed to its strongest since last May
against the Swiss franc as share markets around Asia lost
ground.
 The euro notched another one-year low at $1.2936, with
analysts and traders citing $1.2880-85 as the next target, the
low of April last year, and a breach there seen as opening the
way for a test of $1.25, a level not seen since March 2009.
 The euro shed more than 1.5 percent on Tuesday, its
steepest one-day loss since last June, and broke through key
support around $1.3000, fuelled by concerns that Greece's debt
problems would spread to other economies such as Spain and
Portugal.
 ""A nice downtrend has been established in the euro,"" said
Jonathan Cavenagh, currency strategist at Westpac, Sydney.
 ""One gets the feeling that the euro zone is turning out to
be a basket case and of course rumours about Spain and
Portugal's sovereign debt isn't helping. I suspect the market
wants to take the euro to as low as $1.25 in the short term.""
 The single currency slid 0.2 percent to $1.2956 as of 0340
GMT. It has lost nearly 3 percent just this week, as investors
remain highly sceptical Greece will be able to carry out the
tough austerity measures it promised in return for 110 billion
euro aid package from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund.
 Spreads between benchmark German Bunds and Portuguese and
Spanish bonds widened on Tuesday, while the cost of insuring
against a Greek default rose. The two-year Greek yield surged
by more than 400 basis points to over 16 percent in one its
biggest one-day drops since the Greek debt crisis erupted
earlier this year.
 The euro also fell to its weakest level against the pound
in nearly nine months, stumbling to 85.57 pence, according to
Reuters data, down about 0.2 percent on the day.
 Fears about the spread of Greece's debt crisis have driven
investors to the safety of the Japanese yen and the U.S.
dollar, considered safe-haven investments when risk aversion
spikes.
 ""Everything really depends on what news flow comes out of
Europe over the next few days,"" said Gareth Berry, currency
strategist at UBS in Singapore.
 ""Our analysis shows people are not just short-covering,
they have been buying the dollar for the past couple of weeks.""
 The dollar index rose 0.2 percent to 83.488, after climbing
as far as 83.649, and the greenback was up 0.2 percent at
1.1046 Swiss francs after touching 1.1075 francs.
 It gained 0.2 percent on the yen to 94.73 yen, although it
stopped short of an eight-month high of 94.99 yen struck on
Tuesday, with talk of option barriers at 95 yen and exporter
offers around there expected to limit gains.
 Traders said the dollar was supported by signs that the
U.S. economy was on the mend. Data released on Tuesday showed
pending U.S. home sales rose 5.3 percent in March while factory
orders increased 1.3 percent. Both numbers handily beat
forecasts.

122.83, having lost 1.6 percent in the previous session. Other

 SYDNEY, May 5 (Reuters) - The euro sank to fresh one-year
lows on Wednesday as a sell-off in the single currency gathered
momentum, with sentiment decidedly bearish as fears about
contagion in the euro zone gripped investors.
 The U.S. dollar was a major beneficiary with its index <=USD>
<.DXY> up 0.18 percent, on top of a 1.4 percent rise on Tuesday.
That was the biggest daily gain so far this year and took the

 Charts indicate next support comes in at the $1.2880-1.2890
zone with $1.2883 the April 22 low of last year and $1.2888 the

 Euro/yen  hovered around recent lows at 123 yen,
having lost over 1.6 percent in the previous session. The
Aussie/yen  was down at 86.41 yen, having shed nearly 2
yen on Tuesday.
 But the dollar was firmer on the yen, hovering near 8-month

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro
tumbled on Tuesday amid fears that European Union officials
will not be able to stop Greece's sovereign debt crisis from
spreading around the region.
 The premium that investors demand to buy bonds from other
debt-laden European nations such as Spain and Portugal rose
despite a hefty Greek aid package from the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund.
 The single currency that binds 16 nations hit its lowest
level in a year.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2.5
percent, dragged down by losses for most indices across Europe
and the United States.
 Investor skepticism about the efficacy and implementation
of the 110 billion euro ($146 billion) bailout intensified on
equity markets that were buoyed on Monday by signs of global
growth.
 The rejection of some euro nations' debts could slow the
recovery that has fueled a strong equities rebound since March
2009.
 In exchange for aid, Athens has promised spending cuts and
tax increases worth 30 billion euros over three years, on top
of belt-tightening measures already taken. The key to ending
the crisis is whether Greece can meet budget deficit targets, a
Moody's Investors Service official said. For details, see
[ID:nLDE6351JT]
 ""There is no faith in what the EU and IMF have proposed for
Greece,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at
OANDA, a foreign exchange brokerage in Toronto. ""Capital
markets are betting on a Greek default.""
 U.S. shares slid steeply, echoing drops in Europe that
fully erased 2010 gains for a key index there.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> swooned 225.06
points, or 2.02 percent, to 10,926.77. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> lost 28.66 points, or 2.38 percent, to
1,173.60 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 74.49
points, or 2.98 percent, to 2,424.25.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was off 3 percent to

Spain's IBEX 35 <.IBEX> dropped 5.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225
<.N225> rose 1.2 percent.
 EURO SINKING
 The euro plummeted to a one-year low beneath $1.30 amid
worry that the financial drubbing endured by Greece will spread
to other countries that use the currency. Late in New York, the
euro traded at $1.2991, down 1.52 percent.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  edged lower by
0.11 percent to 94.44. The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> rose 1.31
percent to 83.35.
 Investment advisers at RGE suggested that clients build
short positions on the euro on any sign of strength.
 ""We believe the Greek crisis is only the tip of the
iceberg,"" RGE said. ""The debt sustainability problems in other
euro zone countries are equally serious while the macroeconomic
limitations are often more severe than in Greece.""
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on
Tuesday pointed to indications that the nation has emerged from
recession, and said that data due on May 12 would bear that
out. He discounted dismal views from financial markets, denied
that his nation needed help and noted that Spain has lower debt
to gross domestic product than the European average.
 Still, euro zone fiscal worries overshadowed signs of
global recovery. U.S. stocks staged a broad rally on Monday
that drove the S&P 500 to its best day in two months after
manufacturing, consumer spending and construction data all
instilled confidence in economic recovery.
 Investors ignored U.S. data on Tuesday showing pending
sales of previously owned homes hit a five-month high in March
and that factory orders rose unexpectedly. [ID:nN0498574]
 Strong U.S. data reinforced views that the U.S. Federal
Reserve could raise interest rates this year. Europe's debt
woes are likely to keep euro zone rates on hold in 2010.
 Benchmark government bonds from the euro zone's core and
U.S. Treasuries gained as investors sought safer assets.
 Ten-year euro zone government debt yields 
declined 0.1 percentage point to 2.97 percent, and benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note yields  fell to 3.60
percent from 3.69 percent.
 Spreads between benchmark German Bunds and Portuguese and
Italian bonds widened, while the cost of insuring against a
Greek default rose.
 In energy and commodity trading, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 fell $3.61, or 4.19 percent, to $82.58 per barrel, and

 TORONTO, May 4 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar sank to its
lowest level against its U.S. counterpart in five weeks on
Tuesday as worries about the Greek aid package intensified,
rattling oil and equity markets.
 The Canadian currency fell almost 1-1/2 U.S. cents to touch
a low of C$1.0258 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.48 U.S. cents
minutes after the official Bank of Canada close, its weakest

European countries and the International Monetary Fund to bail
Greece out of its debt problems would succeed. [MKTS/GLOB] [.N]

 Concern about debt woes in the euro zone drove investors
to the safety of the greenback, which in turn pressured oil and
metals prices. [O/R] [GOL/]
 U.S. crude futures dropped $3.45, or 4 percent, to settle
below $83 a barrel, while gold tumbled after hitting five-month
highs above $1,190 earlier in the day.
 ""It's contributing to a strong flight to safety and to U.S.
Treasury markets and a downturn in commodity prices, both of
which weigh against the Canadian dollar,"" said Sal Guatieri,
senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
 The euro hit a one-year low against the greenback on
Tuesday on fears that Greece's woes would spread to other
vulnerable euro zone countries. [FRX/]
 ""They're worried that Europe's economy will come to a
screeching halt and drag down global commodities,"" Guatieri

 The Canadian dollar  closed the North American

down from Monday's North American finish at C$1.0106 to the
U.S. dollar, or 98.95 U.S. cents.
 Significant risk aversion started overnight and flowed

 ""It's broad-based risk version mostly driven by increased
contagion fears in Europe,"" Strauss said.
 He added that market watchers will be looking at key
technical levels, with ""trend line resistance coming in at
C$1.0325"".
 ""A daily close above that level could indicate a sentiment
change towards the Canadian dollar and could open the way for a
further rally in dollar/Canada,"" Strauss said.
 Guatieri said that until markets become more comfortable
with the European credit situation, it may take a while for the
Canadian dollar get back to parity.
 ""We'll see how the situation plays out in coming weeks but
for the moment it's a major headwind for the Canadian dollar.""
 BONDS MOVE HIGHER
 Canadian bond prices moved higher across the curve,

 The concerns about Europe and contagion fears could result
in a slower global recovery than is priced in the market,
Strauss said. ""If that's the case, it could actually put a
damper on central bank tightening or normalizing interest
rates.""

 By Blanca Rodriguez and Judy MacInnes
 MADRID, May 4 (Reuters) - Spain's Socialist government is
confident it can deliver on labour reform and has no doubts
about its ability to ride out the storm rocking the euro zone
and meet fiscal targets, the deputy prime minister said on
Tuesday.
 ""The Spanish economy is reliable. We will meet our deficit
target,"" Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega
told Reuters in an interview.
 Fears that Spain could enter into a debt spiral like Greece
and be hit hard as concerns over weak euro zone members spread
were unfounded, De la Vega said.
 ""There is no risk of any contagion effect from Greece. The
fears are unfounded. We will continue to do our homework in
terms of meeting our commitments,"" she said.
 Renewed selling gripped euro zone financial markets on
Tuesday as concerns mounted that the record 110 billion euros
EU/IMF rescue package for Greece would not stop a debt crisis
spreading to other weak euro zone members. Spanish stocks closed
more than 5 percent lower.
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
dismissed as ""complete madness"" a market rumour that his country
would ask for 280 billion euros in aid from the euro zone.
 The Spanish government has promised 50 billion euros of
budget cuts to 2013 to bring the country's deficit down to 3
percent of GDP from 11.2 percent last year, through a hike in
value added tax and a freeze on civil servants' wages.
 De la Vega played down that Spain may need to introduce
further austerity measures to meet its budget targets.
 ""The most important thing at the moment is to carry through
with the measures we have already announced,"" she said.
 
 KEY LABOUR REFORM
 However, De la Vega said there could be significant advance
later this month on reforming the country's inflexible labour
market.
 Along with budgetary consolidation, labour reform is the
most pressing element for Spain, which currently has the highest
unemployment level in the eurozone running at around 20 percent,
economists say.
 ""The talks are going well. I believe that there will be an
important advance made in May towards reaching an agreement,""
between unions, employers and the government, De la Vega said.
 Labour market reforms, which aim to make it easier for
companies to hire and fire, have met with resistance from the
country's powerful unions but the government has said it will
not attempt to pass any reform without agreement from both
unions and business leaders.
 Spain's economic challenges have mounted as the country has
still not rebounded from recession -- one of the few in Europe
not to do so -- after its worst downturn in decades as a
property boom went bust.
 The country has had seven consecutive quarters of negative
growth.
 De la Vega said the economy was on the mend, although she
predicted that only at the end of this year would things turn
positive.
 ""We are going to return to a positive situation from a
negative one,"" she said. ""We are already seeing positive signs.
We hope that by end of year...slowly growth will return.""
 ""We still have a difficult road ahead,"" she added.
 Turning to the euro currency, she said Spain had been
working to strengthen the euro during the European Union
presidency which it currently holds.
 ""We will continue working to ensure that the euro exits this
crisis strengthened,"" she said.

 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a one-year
low against the dollar on Tuesday on fears that aid for Greece
may not prevent debt crises in other euro zone countries,
prompting investors to seek shelter in the U.S. currency.
 The euro fell below $1.30 for the first time since April
2009 while the dollar rose more than 1 percent against the
Swiss franc, as well as the Australian and Canadian dollars.
 Investors snapped up safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and
punished riskier U.S. <.SPX> and European equities <.FTEU3>.
 ""There is no faith in what the EU and IMF have proposed for
Greece,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at
OANDA, a foreign exchange brokerage in Toronto.
 ""Capital markets are betting on a Greek default, as
Greece's own populace is not going to accept the terms of this
rescue, and contagion is a real concern hurting the euro.""
 Even with Greece set to receive 110 billion euros ($143
billion) in emergency loans from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund, investors are on edge about the
fiscal health of other euro zone countries, especially Spain
and Portugal.
 The IBEX 35 index <.IBEX> of Spanish shares fell more than
5 percent. Spain's prime minister dismissed as ""complete
madness"" a market rumor his country would ask for a 280 billion
euro loan from the euro zone. For more see [ID:nBRU010782].
 Analysts also cited concern about Greece's ability to enact
promised spending cuts as union strikes in the country shut
down tax offices, schools and hospitals. [ID:nLDE6430AH] 
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro  was
down 1.4 percent at $1.3004.
 The single currency traded as low as $1.2993 earlier, its
lowest level since April 2009, according to electronic trading
platform EBS. The euro already has lost more than 9 percent
against the dollar in 2010.
 Tom Fitzpatrick, global head of FX strategy at Citigroup in
New York, said the break below 1.30 on euro/dollar has a
negative ""psychological"" impact but technical charts point to
strong resistance in the 1.2885 area.
 Longer-term indicators show that a weekly close below the
1.3090 level ""would be more significant,"" Fitzpatrick added,
and could pave the way for a further drop to 1.23-1.24, a
re-test of 2009 lows for the currency.

 * Talks to include trade, political dialogue, cooperation
 * EU's Barroso seeks to reassure EU farmers
 * Venezuela will participate as observer
(Recasts with Brazil confirmation, adds comment)
 By Bate Felix
 BRUSSELS, May 4 (Reuters) - The European Union and the
South American trade group Mercosur will relaunch stalled
negotiations on a trade liberalization pact, both sides said on
Tuesday.
 Leaders will formalize the move at an EU-Mercosur summit in
two weeks in Madrid, a senior Brazilian government official
told Reuters.
 Talks to ease trade restrictions and strengthen cooperation
between the European Union and the Mercosur group made up of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay began over a decade
ago, but were suspended in 2004 over trade differences.
 Last year's global financial crisis has revived interest
between the two groups in reviving the negotiations.
 Any agreement could meet strong opposition from EU farmers,
and face a major hurdle in the European parliament over fears
that cheaper agricultural products from Brazil and Argentina
would harm the EU farm sector.
 EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso moved to calm
such fears, saying the decision to relaunch the talks would be
accompanied by conditions.
 ""We will address any adverse impact on certain sectors with
specific measures, in particular in agriculture,"" Barroso said
in a statement.
 The EU's executive said European exporters could benefit
from an increase of about 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) in
exports annually, and the deal would give exporters, investors
and services providers better access to Mercosur's market.
 The EU is Mercosur's largest trading partner, representing
20.7 percent of Mercosur trade. Trade between the blocs stood
at 63 billion euros ($84 billion) in 2009. Europe is also the
largest investor in the region, with 167.2 billion euros ($222
billion) invested in 2008.
 The announcement was welcomed in the Brazilian capital.
 ""We are very satisfied with the EU decision,"" said the
government official, who asked not to be named.
 Since the Doha round of global trade talks ran into a
stalemate, Brazil has tried to resume bilateral trade
negotiations, with the EU in particular.
 But several analysts had expressed caution that internal
divisions among Mercosur countries could derail the talks.
Brazil has traditionally been more willing to accept deeper
industrial tariff reductions than Argentina, for instance.
 Venezuela, which has nationalized large parts of its
economy and is struggling with inflationary pressure, will
participate in the talks as an observer. Pending approval by
the Paraguayan parliament, Venezuela would become a full
Mercosur member.
 With a combined population of about 270 million people and
a total GDP of 1,300 billion euros for the region, the EU is
seeking full liberalization of a large part of trade in goods,
and concessions for all major industrial sectors in return for
access to its market.
 EU FARMERS WORRIED
 ""Any deal that liberalizes agricultural trade between
Mercosur countries and the EU would have extremely damaging
consequences for Europe's farm sector,"" EU farm union
Copa-Cogeca said in a statement.
 Imports of beef and poultry from Brazil and Argentina in
particular would likely increase significantly under such a
deal, Copa-Cogeca said.
 ""This could have serious implications for beef production
in Ireland, France, Scotland and Spain, as well as poultry
production in regions of France, Poland and Hungary,"" said one
EU source, who asked not to be named.
 Farmers are also worried there could also be repercussions
for pig meat production if EU consumers developed a taste for
cheap South American beef and chicken, forcing pork prices down
too in order to compete.
 Likely concessions on biofuel imports to the EU could also
see a sharp increase in ethanol exports from Brazil, the
world's second largest producer, accounting for 95 percent of
total Mercosur ethanol production.

 * Blockage lifted amid signs of U.S. rapprochement
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, May 4 (Reuters) - World Trade Organization members
agreed on Tuesday to start membership talks with Syria, nearly
nine years after it applied to join the global commerce body.
 The move indicated that the United States and Israel were
lifting their long-standing block on Syrian accession
negotiations and trying to work with the Middle Eastern country
rather than ostracise it.
 On Monday the United States extended sanctions on Syria but
acknowledged that the Syrians had made progress in tackling
foreign militant groups. [ID:nN03236094]
 Under the WTO's consensus system, each of the 153 members
has an effective veto, but at Tuesday's meeting of the WTO's
general council, no one blocked a move by Egypt to discuss
Syria's application or a decision to start talks.
 The decision means Syria gains observer status in the WTO
with immediate effect.
 Syria was one of the founder members in 1947 of the WTO's
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
but stopped participating in its work and did not join the WTO
when it was created in 1995.
 But since it applied to join the WTO in October 2001, the
United States and Israel had blocked WTO acceptance, trade
sources said.
 ""We stress that in a rules-based trading system, only
commercial, technical and legal considerations should serve as
the deciding factors in every accession process,"" an Egyptian
diplomat told the council, calling for consideration of Syria's
request.
 Developing countries in the WTO have often expressed concern
at delays in allowing other developing countries to join. Half a
dozen Arab countries including Algeria, Libya and Yemen -- plus
Iran and Afghanistan -- are among those in the queue.
 Some 15 developing and emerging countries spoke in support
of Egypt, but neither the United States nor Israel, nor any
other rich country, took the floor.
 No one objected when the chairman of the General Council,
Canadian ambassador John Gero, proposed setting up a working
party open to all members to negotiate Syria's accession.
 After taking his seat as an observer, Syria's ambassador in
Geneva, Faysal Hamoui, told the council that Syrian membership
would strengthen the global trading system and promote wellbeing
for Syria and the rest of the world.
 ""I would like to thank ... Director-General Pascal Lamy for
his universally acknowledged role for objectivity and
impartiality. Mr. Lamy thank you for all your efforts,"" he said.
 The next step is for Gero to consult members and Syria and
nominate someone to chair that working party.
 That could prove a big hurdle -- no agreement has been
reached on someone to chair Iran's membership negotiations,
delaying their start, even though the United States lifted its
effective veto on creating a working party five years ago.
 Syria will now also have to draw up a memorandum of its
trade policies to serve as a basis for negotiations.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the euro
tumbled on Tuesday amid fears that European Union officials
will not be able to stop Greece's sovereign debt crisis from
spreading around the region.
 The premium that investors demand to buy bonds from other
debt-laden European nations such as Spain and Portugal rose
despite a hefty Greece aid package from the European Union and
the International Monetary Fund. The single currency that ties
16 nations hit its lowest level in a year.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2.4
percent, dragged down by losses of about 3 percent or more for
indexes across Europe and the United States.
 Investor skepticism about the efficacy and implementation
of the 110 billion euro ($146 billion) bailout intensified on
equity markets around the world that were buoyed on Monday by
signs of global growth.
 The rejection of some euro nations' debts could slow the
recovery on which stock investors have based a strong rebound
since March 2009.
 In exchange for aid, Athens has promised spending cuts and
tax increases worth 30 billion euros over three years on top of
belt-tightening measures already taken. The key to ending the
crisis is whether Greece can meet budget deficit targets, a
Moody's Investors Service official said. For details, see

 ""There is no faith in what the EU and IMF have proposed for

 U.S. shares slid steeply, echoing drops in Europe that
fully erased 2010 gains for a key index there.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> dropped 228.31
points, or 2.05 percent, to 10,923.52. The Standard & Poor's

Spain's IBEX 35 <.IBEX> dropped 5.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225
<.N225> rose 1.2 percent.
 EURO SINKING
 The euro tumbled to a one-year low beneath $1.31 amid worry
that the financial drubbing endured by Greece will spread to
other countries. At midday in New York, the euro traded at
$1.3045, down 1.1 percent.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  edged lower by
0.04 percent to 94.50. The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> rose 1.04
percent to 83.128.
 Investment advisers at RGE suggested that clients build
short positions on the currency on any sign of strength.
 ""We believe the Greek crisis is only the tip of the
iceberg,"" RGE said. ""The debt sustainability problems in other
euro zone countries are equally serious while the macroeconomic
limitations are often more severe than in Greece.""
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on
Tuesday pointed to indications that the nation has emerged from
recession, and said that data due on May 12 would bear that
out. He discounted dismal views from financial markets and
noted that Spain has lower debt to gross domestic product than
the European average.
 Still, euro zone fiscal worries overshadowed signs of
global recovery. U.S. stocks staged a broad rally on Monday
that drove the S&P 500 to its best day in two months after
manufacturing, consumer spending and construction data all
instilled confidence in economic recovery.
 Investors ignored the latest U.S. data on Tuesday showing
pending sales of previously owned homes hit a five-month high
in March and that factory orders rose unexpectedly in March.
[ID:nN0498574]
 The strong data reinforced views that the U.S. Federal
Reserve could raise interest rates this year, boosting the
dollar. Europe's debt woes are likely to keep euro zone rates
on hold in 2010.
 Benchmark government bonds from the euro zone's core and
U.S. Treasuries gained as investors sought safer assets.
 Ten-year euro zone government debt yields 
declined 0.13 percentage point to 2.94 percent, and benchmark
10-year U.S. Treasury note yields  fell to 3.62
percent from 3.69 percent.
 Spreads between benchmark German Bunds and Portuguese and
Italian bonds widened, and the cost of insuring against a Greek
default rose.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2010 11:25AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-Can Greece cut its deficit by 11 points by 2014?," By Ingrid Melander
 ATHENS, May 4 (Reuters) - Greece has signed up to a package
of austerity measures designed to cut its deficit by 11
percentage points between 2009 and 2014, an aim that will deepen
the recession and could spark a social backlash.
 The measures agreed this weekend with the EU and IMF include
more tax hikes and steeper cuts in wages and bonuses, in return
for a record 110 billion euro ($146.5 billion) bailout.
[ID:nLDE64107I]
 According to the aid plan, Greece will have to save an extra
30 billion euros on top of tough measures already taken but will
take two years longer than initially planned to bring its budget
deficit below 3 percent of GDP.
 Markets have reacted coolly to the bailout package, with
investors concerned about its viability and the impact of
further belt-tightening on an economy already in recession.
 EU and IMF officials warned Greece would have to take more
austerity steps if those already agreed are not enough to meet
fiscal targets. [ID:nLAW002135]
 Based on conversations with analysts and comparisons with
other EU/IMF bailouts, here are three scenarios Greece faces,
with implications for financial markets:
 
 GOVERNMENT MEETS FISCAL TARGETS
 SCENARIO: Helped by the extra austerity measures and a
successful crackdown on waste and tax evasion, the government
manages to cut the deficit by 11 percentage points by 2014.
 PROBABILITY: Low. Analysts say the new target to cut the
deficit below 3 percent in 2014 is more realistic than the
previous 2012 target, but say risks are still high, with
increasing public opposition and a bleak economic outlook
the main dangers.
 The additional austerity measures will hurt an economy
already in the doldrums, pushing GDP down 4.0 percent this year
and by 2.6 percent in 2011, according to the government. This
would amount to Greece's longest recession in 30 years.
Deflation would complicate plans to keep debt levels steady
between 2011 and 2013, and reduce them from 2014.
 Public opposition to the measures has been rather muted so
far but is on the rise and analysts say keeping public backing
for three years of austerity will be tough as Greeks are prone
to street protests and reluctant to pay taxes.
 MARKET IMPLICATIONS: A deficit cut of 11 percentage points
by 2014 would be a positive surprise for investors and make it
easier for Greece to tap financial markets sooner.
 
 GREECE WIDELY MISSES BUDGET TARGETS
 SCENARIO: The economy shrinks more than expected or does not
start growing again in 2012, with tax revenues collapsing and
Greece widely missing its deficit targets.
 PROBABILITY: Average. The chances of widely missing the
targets will increase if the recession is deeper than the 4
percent contraction forecast for this year or persists longer
than forecast.
 Social unrest could intensify if the unemployment rate
pushes over 11 percent and that could prevent Prime Minister
George Papandreou's government from pushing reforms. Labour
unions have already vowed to resist further austerity.
 Even without social unrest, cutting deficits in times of
economic downturn is extremely difficult, as shown by the
examples of three non-euro-zone EU states that pledged to trim
public finance shortfalls as part of EU and IMF aid packages.
 Latvia agreed with the IMF to aim for a fiscal deficit of 5
percent of GDP last year but ended with almost double that after
austerity measures exacerbated an economic contraction of 18
percent that was more than three times worse than forecast.
 IMF borrower Romania also saw its deficit rise from an
original pledge of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 8.3 percent,
and Hungary targeted a 2.9 percent of GDP deficit, but finished
at 4 percent. All three had to renegotiate targets.
 MARKET IMPLICATIONS: Political instability in Greece would
strongly damage hopes of Greece managing its debt, increasing
the prospects of a debt restructuring or default. This would
raise pressure on Greece to withdraw from the euro zone, at
least temporarily, and could undermine the credibility of the
European single currency. It would also raise market pressure on
euro zone periphery states like Portugal and Spain, potentially
making it more expensive for them to borrow.
 
 GREECE CUTS DEFICIT MODERATELY, MISSES TARGET
 SCENARIO: Greece implements reforms but the new measures
lead to a deeper recession that prevents the government from
fully meeting its deficit-cutting targets.
 PROBABILITY: High. The Greek public sector is in such
disarray that even elementary spending and structural reforms
could generate significant deficit cuts, despite the recession.
The government has already legislated wage and pension cuts in
the public sector of about 2.7 billion euros.
 Defence spending cuts of 460 million euros are also
underway. The government has capped pharmaceuticals prices by
about 1 billion euros to limit hospital spending. The EU has
pledged to speed up disbursement of an extra 1.4 billion euros
earmarked for infrastructure.
 But a deeper recession would mean higher unemployment and
cast doubt on plans to save an additional 30 billion euros
through public spending cuts and increased tax collection.
 MARKET IMPLICATIONS: A slower than forecast deficit cut
would not be a surprise but would create the impression that
Greece has fallen short of its targets, possibly weighing on
investor confidence and delaying the nation's return to markets.

 * Asian economies to lead recovery
 * China economic policy grabs most attention
 * Corporate bond, solar energy initiatives agreed
 
 By Yoo Choonsik and Rie Ishiguro
 TASHKENT, May 4 (Reuters) - Asia's major economies, already
through the worst of the financial crisis, are well equipped to
lead a global recovery if they can guard against the spillover
of sovereign risk and uncertain growth in the developed world.
 Economic planners who gathered this week for the Asian
Development Bank's (ADB) 43rd annual meeting said they were
looking to future growth after a year spent battling the effects
of the crisis, but both China and Japan struck a cautious tone.
 ""Asia is likely to continue to lead the global economy for
the foreseeable future, but the uncertain growth outlook for
industrialised nations poses a risk for the region,"" IMF Deputy
Managing Director Naoyuki Shinohara told Reuters.
 ""Due to the gap in growth rates between Asia and
industrialised nations, capital inflows into emerging Asian
countries may accelerate further,"" he said. ""If such flows
become volatile, they may cause sharp currency moves and raise
inflationary risks.""
 The ADB meeting, held for the first time in ex-Soviet
Central Asia, was overshadowed by China's decision to lift bank
reserve ratios to cool off domestic credit growth, as well as
the Greek fiscal crisis and Thailand's political standoff.
 China demonstrated its growing clout in the international
economic community by attracting attention not only from
reporters but from delegates on what the world's third-largest
economy will do on its currency and interest rate policy.
 ""The world economy is recovering, but the foundation is not
solid,"" Chinese Finance Minister Xie Xuren said. ""Asian
countries are still facing an arduous task to maintain economic
growth and adjust their economic structure.""
 ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda, addressing the event's
closing news conference on Tuesday, urged Asian economies to
look to the future. He echoed comments from other delegates that
Asia was on the road to recovery, but struck a note of caution.
 ""This year, the crisis is behind us in most of Asia but
still some economies in the region are struggling,"" he said.
""Next year, I hope the crisis will be completely over and all
economies will be on the right track.""
 
 CORPORATE BOND INITIATIVE
 East Asian economies, including Japan and China, during the
meeting finalised an important part of their initiative aimed at
funnelling the region's massive savings into corporate bonds
issued in Asian local currencies. [ID:nTOE64100F]
 The ADB, whose members include some of the world's
fastest-growing economies, also launched an ambitious $9 billion
solar energy initiative to help cut carbon emissions while
meeting growing Asian demand for electricity. [ID:nTOE64203D]
 ""Climate change is important and crucial not only for the
environment, but for the sustainable growth of Asia and the
world,"" Kuroda said. The bank earlier identified Central Asia as
a suitable location for its solar energy projects.
 The ADB meeting afforded Uzbekistan, Central Asia's most
populous nation, a rare opportunity to present its economy to
several hundreds top economic planners and potential investors.
[ID:nLDE6410C6]
 Amid tight security, delegates walked to meetings past
enormous fountains and posters depicting the turquoise domes of
the ancient Silk Road cities of Samarkand and Bukhara.
 ""It was a good opportunity for participants to think about
what we will do next, but generally the mood was relaxed and
participation was lower than before,"" said one delegate.
 Officials from Japan, still struggling from the fallout of
the global crisis, kept a low profile at the 67-member
multinational lender's meeting in the Uzbek capital Tashkent.
 ""I am aware that there is greater attention on sovereign
risks than before due to the situations of Greece and Europe,""
said Japanese Finance Minister Naoto Kan. ""Japan needs to take a
firm stance in its fiscal plan due out in June.""
 South Korea took a more aggressive attitude in discussing
global issues.
 ""Countries should both strengthen their domestic financial
systems and enhance regional cooperation to establish a common
crisis response system,"" South Korean Finance Minister Yoon
Jeung-hyun told a session.
 The Manila-based ADB will hold its next annual meeting in
Hanoi, Vietnam.

 * Euro slide extended, trading at lowest in a year
 * Central bank rate policy may reinforce dlr strength
 By Jeremy Gaunt and Al Yoon
 LONDON/NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Global shares and the
euro dropped on Tuesday amid concern EU officials will not be
able to stop the spread of the euro zone sovereign debt
crisis.
 The premium investors demand to hold bonds from other
debt-laden European nations rose, despite a hefty aid package
developed last weekend for Greece. The single-currency that
ties 16 nations hit its lowest in a year.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 2.3
percent, dragged down by losses of 2 percent or more for
indexes across Europe and the United States.
 Investor skepticism about efficacy and implementation of a
planned 110 billion euro aid package to Greece reasserted
itself on the equity markets buoyed on Monday by other signs of
global economic recovery.
 ""These measures were not delivered early enough to prevent
Greece from being priced out of financial markets and
considerable damage being done, which has made the longer-term
adjustment even more difficult,"" HSBC strategist Phil Poole
wrote in a note to clients.
 In exchange for the aid, Athens has promised to carry out
spending cuts and tax increases worth 30 billion euros over
three years, on top of belt-tightening measures already taken.
 A Moody's Investors Service official said the bailout does
not mark the end of the country's fiscal crisis because the key
is whether the country can adjust to meet the budget deficit
targets it has agreed to.
 U.S. shares declined at the open in New York, echoing drops
in Europe that fully erased 2010's gains for one key index.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 157.43 points,
or 1.41 percent, to 10,994.40. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> slipped 18.55 points, or 1.54 percent, to 1,183.71 and
the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> declined 57.93 points, or
2.32 percent, to 2,440.81.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> fell 2.3 percent to
1,040.44. Germany's DAX <.DAX> declined 2.1 percent, while
Spain's IBEX 35 <.IBEX> slumped 4.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225
<.N225> rose 1.21 percent.
 EURO SINKING
 The euro tumbled to a one-year low beneath $1.31 amid worry
that the financial drubbing endured by Greece will spread to
other countries including Portugal and Spain. At mid-mornign in
New York, the euro traded at $1.3054, down 1.05 percent.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  edged higher by
0.03 percent to 94.57. The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> rose 0.98
percent to 83.082.
 Investment advisers at RGE suggested that clients build
short positions on the currency on any sign of strength.
 ""We believe the Greek crisis is only the tip of the
iceberg,"" RGE said. ""The debt sustainability problems in other
euro zone countries are equally serious while the macroeconomic
limitations are often more severe than in Greece.""
 The euro zone fiscal worries overshadowed signs of global
recovery. U.S. stocks staged a broad rally on Monday that drove
the S&P 500 <.SPX> to its best day in two months after
manufacturing, consumer spending and construction data all
instilled confidence in economic recovery.
 Strong economic data also has reinforced views that the
U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year,
boosting the dollar. Europe's debt woes are likely to keep euro
zone rates on hold in 2010.
 Benchmark government bonds from the euro zone's core and
U.S. Treasuries gained as investors sought safer assets.
 Two-year bond yields  declined 0.09 percentage
point to 0.72 percent, with 10-year yields down about 0.10
percentage point to 2.97 percent. Ten-year U.S. government note
yields  fell to 3.63 percent from 3.69 percent.
 Spreads between benchmark German Bunds and Portuguese and
Italian bonds widened and the cost of insuring against a Greek
default rose.
 In energy and commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil
 fell more than $3, or 3,8 percent, to $82.89 per
barrel, and spot gold  rose $3.65, or 0.31 percent, to
$1185.50.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2010 11:24AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Iran's economic woes loom larger than sanctions," * Sanctions just another drag on Iran's economy
 * Inflation, unemployment, slow growth persist
 * Ahmadinejad pursues high-stakes subsidy reform
 
 By Alistair Lyon, Special Correspondent
 BEIRUT, May 4 (Reuters) - Iran's home-grown economic ills
pose a knottier challenge for its hardline leaders than possible
new United Nations or U.S. sanctions over its nuclear programme.
Even so, the world's fifth biggest oil exporter is far from
collapse, despite its economy underperforming and simmering
discontent 11 months after a disputed presidential election.
 Sanctions raise the cost of trade for Iran and are deterring
Western companies from investing or doing business there, but
they also give President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a scapegoat for
economic woes that his critics blame on his own mismanagement.
 ""I do not think his team is up to the serious challenges
that Iran's post-oil boom economy faces,"" said Djavad
Salehi-Isfahani, professor of economics at Virginia Tech.
 ""Sanctions are secondary in terms of negative influence on
the economy, but they do make recovery much harder.""
 Iran's economy will grow 3 percent this year and 3.2 percent
in 2011 after 1.8 percent in 2009, the International Monetary
Fund says, compared to growth for the Middle East and North
Africa region of 4.5 percent in 2010 and 4.8 percent in 2011.
 The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts oil export revenue
at $63.4 billion this year from output of 3.82 million barrels
per day (bpd), up from $53.9 billion last year, when Iran
produced 3.74 million bpd. Crude oil is trading at around $85 a
barrel after averaging $62 in 2009.
 ""With a regional recovery in oil prices and output, Iran
should really be leading the way with much stronger growth,""
said independent Abu Dhabi-based economist Mohammed Shakeel.
 The United States and its European allies are seeking a
fourth round of U.N. sanctions on Iran, proposing a ban on new
energy sector investment, more curbs on Iranian banking and
shipping, a full arms embargo and penalties against members of
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and firms they control.
 The West suspects Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. Tehran
says it only wants fuel for power stations and medical reactors.
 
 TOUGHER SANCTIONS
 The Western sanctions draft stops short of seeking to block
Iran's imports or exports of oil or gas products. Russia and
China are expected to try to water it down further.
 Iran produced 7-8 million bpd before the 1979 revolution and
the 1980-88 war with Iraq, but has never regained those levels.
Sanctions have braked its quest to expand capacity by gradually
scaring away major oil companies with the best technology.
[ID:nLDE643186]
 ""Iran is hoping that East Asian, Russian and Chinese firms
will fill the gap, but they lack the expertise that Total or
Shell could provide,"" Shakeel said. ""Iran can survive, but
nowhere to the point where its growth reflects its potential.""
 Having lived with some form of sanctions for three decades,
most Iranians worry more about rising prices and scarce jobs.
 Central Bank figures show inflation creeping up for a third
straight month to 10.6 percent year-on-year in March, still well
down on a peak of nearly 30 percent in late 2008.
 Unemployment officially hovers around 11 percent, but
Salehi-Isfahani said young people accounted for a worrying 70
percent of the jobless total. Iran needs to create about half a
million jobs a year to absorb newcomers to the labour market.
 ""It is officially denied, but Iran's economic situation is
in a mess,"" Shakeel said. ""It has a very youthful population who
look across the water at Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and say, we have
resources which are phenomenally greater than these micro-states
and yet we lag substantially. The social pressures are there.""
 Oil earnings still account for four-fifths of state revenue,
showing how far Iran has to go to diversify its economy. A surge
of consumer imports under Ahmadinejad has hit local industries
and forced some plants to close in the last two years.
 
 REMOVING SUBSIDIES
 Ahmadinejad, a populist leader who won office in 2005 vowing
to put oil wealth on the table of every Iranian family, now
wants to dismantle Iran's hugely costly subsidy regime.
 He is keen to reduce the country's vulnerability to any
future sanctions on petrol imports by reducing consumption. A
lack of refining capacity now means Iran needs to import 30-40
percent of its needs, but it hopes to be self-sufficient by
2013. [ID:nLDE63MOWP]
 Parliament has resisted Ahmadinejad's plans to cut $40
billion off a subsidy bill put at $100 billion a year, or a
third of Gross Domestic Product. But it still approved half that
amount, despite critics who say the measure will fuel inflation.
 ""Every faction in Iran came round to the idea that lifting
subsidies would lead to an economic transformation,"" said Kevan
Harris, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University.
 ""There is consensus on the theory. The battle is over
implementation, administration and control.""
 Ahmadinejad has promised to compensate the needy for the
removal of price supports on petrol and other refined products,
natural gas, electricity, water, food, health and education.
 Details of the reform plan, to be implemented over five
years, remain sketchy and the changes have yet to start.
 For Ahmadinejad tackling subsidies is a high-risk strategy.
 ""The immediate impact of subsidy reduction is that prices
will rise. That adds to popular sentiment against the government
because it is such a presidential-led move,"" Shakeel said.
 A popular backlash against cost of living increases could
prompt Ahmadinejad to delay or even scupper the reform.
 ""I doubt he will do it if it is politically costly,"" said
Salehi-Isfahani. ""Rising unemployment is a much bigger challenge
in the medium term than the subsidy issue. The recession is much
less under his control, so it is more dangerous.""
 While Ahmadinejad strides the world stage defending Iran's
nuclear programme and denouncing the United States, his
conservative rivals in parliament attack his economic policies.
 ""They are hammering away at him with allegations of financial
mismanagement and targeting some of his advisers,"" said Scott
Lucas, professor of American studies at Birmingham University.
 ""It's getting really messy there. He may not actually be
deposed, but the real push is to curb his authority.""
"
1689,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2010 11:04AM ET</span>",Merkel to defend Greece aid in parliament," BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel
will defend her government's decision to participate in a
bailout plan for debt-stricken Greece in a speech to the
Bundestag lower house of parliament on Wednesday at 0630 GMT.
 Both the upper and lower houses of parliament are expected
to vote this Friday on a draft law that would allow Germany to
participate an aid package for Greece agreed by European finance
ministers last Sunday.
 The parliamentary budgetary committee will hold an open
debate on the draft law on Wednesday between 0830 and 1130 GMT.
Attending the debate will be Bundesbank President Axel Weber and
Ulrich Schroeder, the head of the German state bank that would
lend money to Greece if Berlin approves the aid package.
 Germany, which has taken a series of measures in recent
years to curb its own budget deficit, had taken a stand against
a quick Greek bailout to try and raise pressure on other states
to take more responsibility for their own finances.
 However, Merkel bowed to pressure from the European Union
and International Monetary Fund last week as market turmoil
grew, throwing her support behind a rescue, and now she must
convince parliament and sceptical voters.

 * Probe comes after Greece ranked alongside Pakistan
 * French AMF regulator against European rating agency body

(Adds comments from France's AMF regulator)
 By John O'Donnell
 BRUSSELS, May 4 (Reuters) - The European Commission has told
credit rating agencies to watch their step when judging a
country's financial health, saying they would probe their work
and could even set up a central agency to take on their job.
 It is the clearest warning yet from the 27-country bloc's
executive to an industry that senior European officials have
criticised privately for being too harsh in downgrading Greece
as it teetered on the edge of financial collapse.
 ""I think we need to go further to look at the impact of the
ratings on the financial system or economic system as a whole,""
Michel Barnier, the commissioner in charge of an overhaul of
financial services, told the European Parliament.
 ""The power of these agencies is quite considerable not only
for companies but also for states. That's why I asked for
responsibility to be assumed in the work they are doing,"" he
said, adding that the Commission would examine possible
conflicts of interest.
 ""If you look at Greece, for example, I was quite surprised
by the quite rapid deterioration in rating,"" he said.
 Signalling his dissatisfaction that just three companies --
Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- dominate the industry,
Barnier said he was examining the idea of a new agency which
could rate governments.
 Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the head of France's AMF stock market
regulator, said he favoured having an international ratings
agency rather than a European one.
 Jouyet said an international agency could operate under the
guidance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and be split
between the state and private sectors.
 ""A public European (ratings) agency would not be credible
outside Europe,"" he said.
 In his role as commissioner, Barnier has significant power
in deciding how rating agencies are allowed do business.
 Although a new legal regime for the agencies, which will
demand they explain how they make decisions on downgrades, is
set to start this December, Barnier could beef up the rules.
 Debt-laden Greece, which was last weekend bailed out by a
110 billion euro ($147 billion) rescue from European neighbours
and the International Monetary Fund, has been marked down to
junk status by S&P and now hovers close to Pakistan in the
credit stakes.
 European officials want the muscle of Greece's euro zone
partners such as Germany and France to be taken into account
when calculating a euro zone country's financial health.
 Rating agencies had been blamed for carelessness before the
Greek crisis, handing out over-generous ratings on the packets
of mortgage-backed securities that subsequently unravelled,
sending the global economy into a spin.
 Barnier's suggestion for a new rating agency revives an old
chestnut in Europe where some want the dominance of three global
agencies, Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch, diluted by a
home-grown rival.
 Standard & Poor's and Moody's are American. Fitch, even
though owned by Fimalac of France, is perceived by some as being
American with its chief executive based in New York.
 European policymakers have long pushed for more competition
as well as stronger local connections. But experts warn that any
new agency would have to stand on its own feet as a business to
avoid creating the impression of close links to government.

 * Liberia remains a tough, frontier market
 
 By Tim Cocks
 MONROVIA, May 4 (Reuters) - Mining and agriculture companies
are preparing to pour billions of dollars into Liberia, but the
battle-scarred nation faces big hurdles if it is to turn these
investments into a robust post-war recovery.
 After 15 years of near constant conflict that killed tens of
thousands and left its infrastructure in tatters by the time it
ended in 2003, the small West African nation is opening up to
foreign investment, especially into its rich iron ore deposits.
 Since coming to power in 2006, President Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf has tried to restore stability and woo investors to a
country that was more often associated with child soldiers and
conflict diamonds than billion dollar projects.
 ""This country is so rich,"" national investment commission
chairman Richard Tolbert told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Iron ore, gold, diamonds, rubber, coffee, cocoa, timber,
oil palm. We've got the land, labour and natural resources. We
need the finance, knowhow and access to markets. Better jump on
this band wagon, because it's moving fast.""
 Top steelmaker ArcelorMittal and the world's biggest miner
BHP Billiton have large concessions in Liberia, as does Russia's
Severstal. Officials are in talks with Brazilian miner Vale
, the world's biggest iron ore producer.
 The largest single investment in the country is China
Union's $2.6 billion iron ore project, which officially opened
towards the end of last month.
 Asian palm oil companies are seeking plantation concessions
in the well watered countryside. Production of rubber, still
Liberia's biggest export until iron gets underway, is on the
rise.
 Such things were unthinkable during war-wracked reign of
former President Charles Taylor, ousted by rebels in 2003, and
now on trial for war crimes in neighbouring Sierra Leone.
 
 ""FRONTIER MARKETS""
 The numbers look impressive, but transforming Liberia from a
broken into a prosperous nation is a huge task.
 Around three quarters of Liberia's 3.5 million people are
unemployed, Tolbert said, and the country is heavily dependent
on donor aid to help run almost every aspect of government.
 Liberia hosts the second largest U.N. peacekeeping mission
in Africa, after Democratic Republic of the Congo.
 U.N. police vehicles ply the streets of Monrovia on routine
patrols for which Liberian police lack the resources. Outside
the capital, warlords are kept at bay largely by U.N. troops.
 Diplomats say the mission even helps draft legislation.
 Few jobs will be created by the iron ore projects. Tolbert
estimates each project will create between 2,000 and 3,000
direct jobs, though farming would have more of an impact on
employment: a palm oil project signed with Sime Darby will bring
30,000 jobs. Another being negotiated with Indonesia's Golden
Agri Resources would create 40,000.
 While mining giants have been welcomed, smaller businesses
complain of red tape, high taxes, corruption and harassment.
""This is not a very investor-friendly place,"" said Harry
Greaves, a local businessman and former head of the national
petroleum refinery.
 ""The legal system is tough, laws are too favourable to
debtors, people in government constantly harass business, doing
all kinds of inspections. Corruption is a big problem.""
 Officials say efforts have been made to tackle this,
pointing out that registering a business now takes 27 days,
instead of 90, and that the nation has been praised by the World
Bank for its reforms, moving it up the ease of doing business
index to 149th this year from 173rd in 2008.
 But poor roads and power shortages remain a big deterrent.
 ""The biggest challenge we have is the cost of electricity,
which has made people uncomfortable about business here,"" Deputy
Commerce Minister Frederick Norkeh told Reuters.
 ""But still, the potential is high. We're one of the last
frontier markets.""

 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a one-year
low beneath $1.31 on Tuesday, hit by fear that emergency aid
for Greece may not prevent debt crises in other euro zone
countries.
 Strong economic data has also reinforced views that the
U.S. economy is on the mend and that the central bank could
raise interest rates this year, boosting the dollar. Europe's
debt woes are likely to keep euro zone rates on hold in 2010.
 Even with Greece set to receive 110 billion euros in
emergency loans from the European Union and IMF, investors
remained on edge about the fiscal health of other euro zone
countries, including Spain and Portugal. The IBEX 35 index
<.IBEX> of Spanish shares was down almost 4 percent.
 Investors also fretted about Greece's ability to enact
promised spending cuts as unions staged strikes, shutting down
tax offices, government ministries, schools and hospitals.

 ""There is no faith in what the EU and IMF have proposed for
Greece,"" said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at
OANDA, a foreign exchange brokerage in Toronto.
 ""Capital markets are betting on a Greek default, as
Greece's own populace is not going to accept the terms of this
rescue, and contagion is a real concern hurting the euro.""
 The euro  fell 0.9 percent to $1.3073, according to
Reuters data, its lowest level since April 2009.
 Popplewell said traders were gunning for a move below
$1.30, which would prove strong support for the single
currency. ""But once it goes, the euro will fall like a lead
weight, with $1.25 possible,"" he said. Traders said any move
higher would likely be capped at $1.3170 and then $1.3230.
 AUSSIE TIGHTENING
 Sterling slipped 0.6 percent to $1.5156 ahead of Britain's
May 6 parliamentary election. The Australian dollar 
slid 1.2 percent to $0.9150  after the Reserve Bank of
Australia raised interest rates by 25 basis points but also
signaled the first stage of its tightening cycle was over.
[ID:nSGE6420LX]
 Traders also cited China's monetary tightening announced
over the weekend as adding to pressure on the Aussie and
Canadian dollar, both growth-sensitive, commodity-linked
currencies.
 The dollar was flat at 94.50 yen , having earlier
risen as high as 94.98 yen, its strongest since Aug. 24. A
general decline in investors' appetite for risk, driven by the
euro zone debt worries and tighter policy in China, supported
Japan's currency, knocking the euro down 0.7 percent to 123.85
yen  and hurting European equities <.FTEU3>.
 Traders said the U.S. dollar was benefiting partly from
that risk aversion as well, though traders were also growing
increasingly confident that a U.S. recovery was on track.
 Data on Monday showing U.S. manufacturing registered its
fastest pace of growth in nearly six years last month helped,
and investors expect Friday's payrolls report to show another
month of job gains in April.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of the greenback against
six major currencies, hit its highest level since May 2009.

 TORONTO, May 4 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar fell sharply
against the U.S. currency on Tuesday as investors steered away
from risk on jitters about Greece's aid package, rattling oil
and equity markets.
 U.S. stock index futures pointed to a weaker open on
Tuesday, while European stock markets also slid as investors
remained highly cautious about the weekend agreement among
European countries and the International Monetary Fund to a 110
billion euro aid package to Greece. [MKTS/GLOB] [.N]
 The euro retreated on concerns about Greece's debt problems
and fears of possible contagion to other vulnerable euro zone
countries, helping to push up the greenback to a near one-year
high. [FRX/]
 ""We have overall fears ... of ongoing problems for Europe
and that the aid package for Greece doesn't really solve the
underlying problems. We have a spike higher in risk aversion so
commodities lower, equities lower and the U.S. dollar
stronger,"" said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia
Capital.
 At 7:53 a.m (1153 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was at
C$1.0180 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.23 U.S. cents, down from
Monday's North American finish at C$1.0106 to the U.S. dollar,
or 98.95 U.S. cents.
 Oil prices tumbled to below $85 a barrel, pressured in part
by a strong U.S. dollar and on an expected rise in U.S. crude
and fuel stocks. [O/R]
 Still, while the Canadian currency's move lower was largely
precipitated by external factors, it will likely head back
toward parity at some point soon, said Sutton.
 ""The broader trend is still a downward move in
dollar/Canada and everything is still very much in line for
dollar/Canada moving back to parity,"" she said.
 ""In the very near term, today or tomorrow, we could easily
see a push higher back above C$1.02.""
 Canadian bond prices moved higher across the curve,
following a rise in U.S. Treasuries where prices climbed as
investors flocked to the safety of government bonds. [US/]
 The two-year Canadian government bond  was up 6
Canadian cents to C$99.38 to yield 1.846 percent, while the
10-year bond  rose 44 Canadian cents to C$99.30 to
yield 3.584 percent.
