8,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2015 05:28PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls below 1.07, as investors flock to dollar following attacks","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Monday to approach near seven-month lows, as currency traders sought safety in the dollar following Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris that claimed the lives of at least 125 civilians in the capital of France.
EUR/USD traded between 1.0675 and 1.0759 during Monday's session before settling at 1.0686, down 0.0088 or 0.82% on the session. The currency pair closed in the red for the third straight session and the fourth time over the last six trading days while resuming its push toward parity on Monday. Over the last month of trading, the euro has fallen more than 6% against the dollar amid signs of diverging monetary policies between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0673, the low from November 10 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Currency traders closely monitored activity in Syria after France launched a series of airstrikes against ISIS on Sunday, which claimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris. Major catastrophes such as last week's terrorist attacks in France can provoke hasty reactions in foreign exchange markets before normal activity resumes.
Investors also continued to react to the increasing likelihood that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates when it meets next on Dec. 15-16. When Fed chair Janet Yellen testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Nov. 4, she said the December meeting will be considered ""live"" for a rate hike decision if the Fed sees continued improvement in the economy and labor market. Then, last Thursday, Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer reiterated that he believes long-term inflation will move back toward the Fed's long-term goal of 2%, as transitory effects from a strong dollar and low energy prices continue to recede.
Nearly a decade has passed since the FOMC last raised its benchmark Federal Funds Rate. Short-term interest rates have remained at their current near-zero range for nearly seven years since the height of the Financial Crisis.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, jumped more than 0.50% on Monday to an intraday high of 99.54 before settling at 99.47. The index approached last week's highs of 99.60 when it surged to its strongest level in seven months.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained three basis points to close at 2.27%. Although bond yields on U.S. 10-year treasuries have surged by 23 basis points over the last month they are still down by six basis points on the year.

19,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 13, 2015 05:34PM ET</span>","EUR/USD moves lower amid Fischer's hawkish comments, weak euro zone GDP","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell considerably on Friday to close the week below 1.08, as hawkish comments from Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer on the potential rebound of U.S. inflation increased the likelihood of an interest rate hike by the U.S. central bank next month.
Investors also reacted to sluggish euro zone GDP figures for the third quarter, which could expedite plans from the European Central Bank to ramp up its asset-purchasing program.
The currency pair traded between 1.0714 and 1.0817 on Friday before settling at 1.0764, down 0.0051 or 0.47% on the session. For the week, the euro remained relatively flat against the dollar after plunging 1.2% last Friday following a robust October U.S. jobs report. Over the last month, however, the euro has tumbled more than 5.25% amid indications of the potential divergence of monetary policies between the Fed and the ECB.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0673, the low from November 10 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Thursday evening after the close of trading, Fischer reiterated that long-term inflation will move back toward the Fed's long-term goal of 2%, as transitory effects from a strong dollar and low energy prices continue to recede. Earlier this week, the dollar soared to a seven-month high as currency traders reacted to last week's stellar U.S. jobs report from October. Crude futures, meanwhile, slumped to near six-and-a-half year lows in Friday's session amid further signs of a glut of oversupply on global energy markets. Inflation has remained below the Fed's long-term goal of 2% in every month over the last three years.
In September, the PCE Price Index inched up 0.2% on a yearly basis following a 0.3% gain a month earlier. The Core PCE Price Index, which strips out food and energy prices, rose by 1.3%, unchanged from August. The core index is the Fed's preferred gauge for long-term inflation.
""From the standpoint of the outlook, this transience means that some of the forces holding down inflation in 2015--particularly those due to a stronger dollar and lower energy prices--will begin to fade next year,"" Fischer said in a speech at the Fed's conference on Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis. ""Consequently, overall PCE inflation is likely on this account alone to rebound next year to around 1-1/2 percent. And as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, both core and overall inflation are likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.""
Elsewhere, U.S. retail sales in October ticked up by 0.1%, two-tenths under consensus estimates due in part to sharp declines in electronic & appliance purchases and grocery sales. Core sales, minus auto and gas prices, increased by 0.3% after a flat reading in September. Producer prices, meanwhile, tumbled 0.4%, amid continued declines in the services industry. Business inventories, however, rose by a stronger than expected 0.3% last month.
In Europe, GDP in the third quarter  increased moderately by 0.3%, following a lackluster gain of 0.4% three months earlier. Analysts expected to see economic growth in the euro zone of 0.4% last quarter. Disappointing international trade data served as a drag on growth in Italy and Germany, while restraining further upward movement in France. One day after ECB president Mario Draghi sent strong hints that the Governing Council could expand its quantitative easing program when it meets next month, the downbeat data could provide additional pressure on the central bank to act.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, closed the week at 98.90, up 0.33% on the session.

On Thursday, a half dozen monetary policymakers from the Federal Open Market Committee, including Yellen and vice chairman Stanley Fischer were scheduled to make public comments ahead of its highly anticipated meeting next month on Dec. 15-16. In welcoming remarks at the Fed's conference on Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis, Yellen declined to address the FOMC's near-term outlook regarding a potential rate hike or the current state of the U.S. economy.
Instead, Yellen spoke briefly on the importance of assessing how monetary policy impacts the global economy in the post-crisis period.
“At the peak of the crisis and during its immediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world,” Yellen said. “The post-crisis period has offered policy makers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy and operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the effectiveness of different policy options.”
Minutes later, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond president Jeffrey Lacker noted in a speech before The Cato Institute's 33rd Annual Monetary Policy Conference that monetary policy determines the ""long-run path"" of price levels, a notion he said has remained ""essentially unchanged since the Great Recession."" Lacker has dissented in each of the last two FOMC's meetings, voting each time for a quarter-point rate hike. Earlier at the conference, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard reiterated prior views that the FOMC's unemployment and inflation goals have been met, providing ""no reason to hold rates"" at near-zero levels.
A stronger dollar remains a headwind to the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said Thursday, noting accommodative monetary policy helped the economy withstand the impact.
""While the dollar's appreciation and foreign weakness have been a sizable shock, the U.S. economy appears to be weathering them reasonably well, notwithstanding their large effects on certain sectors of the economy heavily exposed to international trade,"" Fischer said in remarks prepared for a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Board.
""Monetary policy has played a key role in achieving these outcomes through deferring liftoff relative to what was expected a little over a year ago,"" he added.

The euro jumped to its highest level against the dollar in five sessions after ECB president Mario Draghi offered further hints that the bank is ready to introduce additional stimulus measure in order to boost inflation throughout the euro zone. At the same time, a handful of policymakers from the Fed expressed strong objections to raising its benchmark Federal Funds Rate when it meets next in December.
EUR/USD traded in a broad range between 1.0692 and 1.0831 before settling at 1.082, up 0.71% on the session. On Tuesday, the euro fell to a seven-month low against the dollar as investors continued to digest a robust U.S. jobs report from last week that strengthened hawkish arguments for an imminent rate hike. In spite of Thursday's steady gains, the euro is still down by nearly 5% against its American counterpart over the last month.
The currency pair likely gained support at 1.0673, the low from November 10 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
In testimony before the European Parliament on Thursday morning, Draghi told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), that indications of a ""sustained turnaround in core inflation have somewhat weakened"" over the last several weeks. Last month, core inflation in the euro zone ticked up to 1% on an annual basis, considerably below the ECB's long-term target.
In response, the ECB could expand the scope of its comprehensive €60 billion a month quantitative easing program when the Governing Council meets next in early-December. Among the tools at the ECB's disposal include lowering interest rates and extending the program beyond September, 2016. In addition, Reuters reported on Wednesday that the ECB is exploring the possibility of purchasing municipal bonds in the City of Paris and several cities in Germany to further bolster the economy.
In the U.S. a handful of Federal Open Market Committee members, including chair Janet Yellen made public appearances on Thursday, ahead of its critical meeting on Dec. 15-16. In welcoming remarks at the Fed's conference on Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis, Yellen declined to address the FOMC's near-term outlook regarding a potential rate hike or the current state of the U.S. economy. Instead, Yellen spoke briefly on the importance of assessing how monetary policy impacts the global economy in the post-crisis period.
Shortly after, New York Fed president William Dudley said at a speech in New York that he believes a December lift-off depends on the incoming data over the next several weeks as the risks of moving too quickly or too slowly are currently ""nearly balanced."" On Thursday evening, Fed chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to deliver a speech on the transmission of exchange rates to output and inflation at the Fed's post-crisis conference.

The currency pair traded between 1.0706 and 1.0774 before settling at 1.0742, up by 0.0018 or 0.17% on the session. It came one day after the euro tumbled to a six-month low against the dollar amid increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates when it meets next in December. After nearly reaching 1.15 in mid-October, the euro has lost more than 5% against the dollar. EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0519, the low from April 13 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
On Wednesday morning, Reuters reported that the ECB is exploring the possibility of purchasing municipal bonds in the City of Paris and several cities in Germany in an effort to expand the scope of its €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program. After selling more than $75 billion in bonds in 2014, European cities and regions currently have nearly $500 billion in bonds in circulation, according to data obtained by Reuters. The ECB could approve further stimulus measures when its Governing Council meets next in early-December. 
ECB president Mario Draghi, meanwhile, offered no hints on the possible expansion of the asset purchasing program during an appearance at the Bank of England's Open Forum on Wednesday. Some investors had hoped that Draghi would use his speech as a means for further devaluing the euro by providing clues on the monetary tools the ECB could consider next month to help stimulate growth. Instead, Draghi reiterated the importance of European integration, specifically in the banking sector, as speculation of the United Kingdom's eventual departure from the European Union continues to proliferate.
Investors await the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day conference on Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis period on Thursday for stronger indications on the growing possibility of a December rate hike. Fed chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to make the opening remarks on Thursday morning, while Fed chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to deliver a speech on the transmission of exchange rates to output and inflation on Thursday evening. In total, six members of the Federal Open Market Committee are scheduled to speak on Thursday. Last week, Yellen told a Congressional hearing that an interest rate hike will be a ""live possibility"" at its December FOMC meeting if the economy and labor market demonstrated continued improvement over the next several weeks.

The currency pair traded between 1.0675 and 1.0764 before settling at 1.0725, down 0.25% on the session. The euro has closed down against the dollar in three of the last four and five of the last seven sessions, amid strong hints from the Federal Open Market Committee that it will hike rates at its December meeting. Since surging above 1.14 in mid-October, the euro has lost approximately 6% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0519, the low from April 13 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
The dollar extended gains against the euro from last Friday when it surged more than 1.25% after the release of arguably the strongest U.S. jobs report of the year. In October, nonfarm payrolls soared by 271,000, considerably above expectations for gains of 190,000. Average hourly wages also shot up by 0.4%, while the U-3 and U-6 unemployment rates each fell to their lowest levels in more than seven years. 
The release of the optimistic data came two days after Fed chair Janet Yellen told a Congressional hearing that an interest rate hike will be a ""live possibility"" at its December FOMC meeting if the economy and labor market demonstrated continued improvement over the next several weeks. Following last week's developments, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch set the odds of a December rate hike around 70%, up from previous estimates in the low 60s. 
On Thursday, a host of FOMC members including Yellen are slated to make appearances at the Federal Reserve's two-day conference on Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis period. Yellen is scheduled to make the opening remarks on Thursday morning, while Fed chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to deliver a speech on the transmission of exchange rates to output and inflation on Thursday evening. 
The Fed's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since 2009. Nearly a decade has elapsed since the FOMC has last raised short-term interest rates. A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell by one basis point on Tuesday to 2.33%, halting a seven-day winning streak. 
Investors also await the release of the latest third-quarter GDP figures in the euro zone later this week for further indications on potential growth trends over the next several months. GDP in the euro zone is expected to rise 0.4% on a quarterly basis, after a 0.4% increase in the second quarter. On an annual basis, third quarter GDP is expected to increase by 1.7%, following a gain of 1.5% last quarter.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0719 and 1.0790 before settling at 1.075, up 0.0010 or 0.09% on the session. Last Friday, the euro crashed by more than 1.25% to a six-month low against the dollar following the strongest monthly U.S. jobs report in nearly a year. The euro has closed lower against its American counterpart in four of the last six sessions. Over the last month of trading, the euro is down by nearly 5% versus the dollar. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at at 1.0623, the low from April 16 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
Investors continued to react to last week's robust U.S. national employment report when the Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls in October surged by 271,000, considerably above estimates of a 190,000 gain. The unemployment rate, also inched down to 5.0%, its lowest since April, 2008, while average hourly wages soared 0.4%, considerably above forecasts of a 0.2% increase.
The U-6 unemployment rate, a preferred measure of underemployment by Fed chair Janet Yellen, plunged by 0.2% to 9.8%, its lowest level since May, 2008. The U-6 rate measures the total level of unemployed workers plus those marginally attached to the labor force, as well as workers who are no longer looking for a job, but have looked for one over the last 12 months. The alternative measure of unemployment peaked at 18% in January, 2011 and exceeded 11% exactly one year ago.
Over the last few months, Yellen has indicated that the Federal Open Market Committee will employ a data-driven approach, as it weighs whether to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. In testimony before Congress last week, Yellen noted that a December interest rate hike will be on the table if the Fed sees continued improvements in the economy and labor market. Investors await the release of data on U.S. retail sales, producer prices and consumer sentiment later this week for additional clues on whether the FOMC will approve a quarter-point rate hike when it meets next on Dec. 15-16.
In the euro zone, currency traders await the release of the latest third-quarter GDP figures later this week for further indications on potential growth trends over the next several months. GDP in the euro zone is expected to rise 0.4% on a quarterly basis, after a 0.4% increase in the second quarter. On an annual basis, third quarter GDP is expected to increase by 1.7%, following a gain of 1.5% last quarter.

You got the feeling that it was only a matter of time.
Bitcoin (BTC/USD) just broke through $400 on Bitstamp for the first time in nearly a year, a new milestone in its biggest rally in 18 months.
Bitcoin hit $300 only a week ago. In highly November 2013-esque fashion, it has taken on a life of its own, casting aside its steady climb and soaring by another 13% during the past 24 hours to $413.
The pace of bitcoin's rise accelerated noticeably yesterday, when it gained over 10% within a 5-hour span.
Traders have come to the point of driving the price higher knowing full well that the next one will do the same.
Bitcoin has now more than doubled since falling below $200 in late August.
Chinese exchanges like Huobi already breached $400 a few hours earlier. The USD equivalent on Huobi hit $425, about 5% ahead of Bitstamp, and further suggesting that this party is being led by Chinese traders.
Prices on BTC-e are roughly 5% below those on Bitstamp and 10% below those on Huobi, a slightly lower gap than yesterday but still an unsettling phenomenon for one of the largest USD exchanges.

Bitcoin is now a whopping 54% above its 50-day moving average (MA), its biggest differential since the great bubble of November 2013.
Shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) opened the day at $49.00, their highest level since shortly after launching for public trade in May, and implying a 31% premium to their underlying bitcoin value. The shares are now trading at $47.00, or a 23% premium.
One can assume that a big correction is in order, the question now being how high bitcoin will go first.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0708 and 1.0894 before settling at 1.0739, down 0.0144 or 1.31% on the session. At one point, the euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar since April 22. After peaking above 1.1475 in mid-October, the euro has slumped nearly 6% versus its American counterpart over the last three and a half weeks. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0708, the low from April 21 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said in its October national employment report that nonfarm payrolls surged by 271,000 last month, significantly above expectations for a consensus gain of 190,000. The sharp gains marked the largest increase in U.S. nonfarm jobs since last December. Private payrolls also soared by 268,000 in October, above forecasts of a 174,000 increase. 
Large upswings in Professional and Business Services and Trade & Transportation, as well as Retail Trade ahead of the Holiday season, bolstered overall job gains. Within the Professional and Business Services sector, which added 78,000 positions, temporary jobs rose by 25,000. Temporary hiring is a leading indicator for future employment. Restrained by weak export levels, Manufacturing employment remained flat, following two prior months of declines. 
One month after wages nationwide ended September unchanged, average hourly earnings jumped 0.4%, considerably above forecasts of a 0.2% gain. Over the last 12 months, hourly wages have spiked by 2.5%, their strongest annual increase in more than six years. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, dipped by 0.1% to 5.0%, in line with consensus estimates. 
The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader gauge of the national employment situation, fell by 0.2% to 9.8%, its lowest level since May, 2008. The reading, which measures the total level of unemployed workers plus those marginally attached to the labor force, stood at 11.1% last October. The indicator also accounts for workers who are no longer looking for a job, but have looked for one over the last 12 months. 
By comparison, the alternative measure of underemployment peaked at 18% in January, 2010, as the nation continued to recover from the Financial Crisis. The U-6 rate is a preferred measure of unemployment by Fed chair Janet Yellen as she assesses the strength of the U.S. labor market. 
On Wednesday in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, Yellen sent strong hints that the Federal Open Market Committee could raise short-term interest rates at its December meeting if the economy demonstrated continued improvement. The FOMC's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current near-zero level since 2009. Following Friday's optimistic employment report, the CME Group (O:CME) increased the probability of a December rate hike to 70%, up from a percentage in the low 60s in response to Yellen's comments on Capitol Hill. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, shot up more than 1.25% to an intraday high of 99.47, before closing slightly lower at 99.29. The index soared to its highest level since mid-April. 
The Fed's first rate hike in nearly a decade is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors abroad pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields. Next month, the European Central Bank is also expected to increase the scope of its EUR 1.1 trillion asset-purchasing plan and possibly lower rates following comments from ECB president Mario Draghi earlier this week.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0834 and 1.0897 before settling at 1.0880, up 0.0016 or 0.15% on the session. The euro remained at its lowest level since late-July, one day after plunging nearly 1% when Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen told Congress that a rate hike decision could be on the table at its December FOMC meeting. Over the last month of trading, the euro has lost nearly 3% in value against the dollar. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
For the most part, currency traders were hesitant to make any major moves ahead of Friday's October jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. On Friday morning, the Labor Department is expected to report that nonfarm payrolls increased by 190,000 last month after an extremely soft gain of 142,000 in September. Analysts also expect the unemployment rate to fall 0.1% to 5.0% and average hourly earnings to tick up by 0.2 to 0.2%. 
In comments before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Yellen indicated that while measures of labor underutilization have declined in recent months gains in the labor market have still been lower than the Fed anticipated. The next two U.S. job reports are viewed as critical for policymakers in favor of an imminent rate hike. Yellen reiterated in her testimony that the Federal Open Market Committee will continue to take a data driven approach to its decision on whether to normalize monetary policy. 
Nearly a decade has passed since the FOMC last raised its benchmark Federal Funds Rate. The U.S. central bank has left the rate at which banks can borrow on overnight loans at its current level of zero to 0.25% since the height of the Financial Crisis. Over the last week, the FOMC has sent strong signals that it could raise the Federal Funds Rate if it sees continued improvements in the economy and indications that long-term inflation is moving toward its target of 2%. 
Also on Thursday, the Bank of England signaled that it could wait well into 2016 before raising interest rates after it held its benchmark rate at 0.5%. In addition, the Bank expects inflation to remain near zero in its latest forecast with only modest increases over the next year. EUR/GBP surged 1.31% to 0.7154, while GBP/USD plunged 1.13% to 1.5209. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.20% on Thursday to an intraday high of 98.24, before settling at 98.07. With the slight gains, the dollar remained near three-month highs.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0844 and 1.0968, before settling at 1.0863, down 0.0101 or 0.92% on the session. EUR/USD has closed lower in each of the last three sessions and five of the last eight trading days. Since surging above 1.14 in mid-October, the euro has tumbled by more than 5% against the dollar.

EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1489, the high from Oct. 14. 
In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday morning, Yellen noted that the U.S. economy is ""performing well,"" amid solid increases in domestic spending, as some of the downside risks related to the global economic slowdown over the summer have faded. The Federal Open Market Committee, Yellen said, also expects long-term inflation to move toward its targeted goal of 2%, as temporary drags from a stronger dollar and lower energy prices recede.
The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor statistics will release two monthly national employment reports before the FOMC next meets in December, including one on Friday. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis will also release its second estimate of U.S. third quarter GDP and its October report on Personal Income and Outlays later this month.
""If the incoming information supports that expectation then our statement indicates that December would be a live possibility. Importantly, we've made no decision about it,"" Yellen said in her testimony.
Yellen emphasized that lift-off might be justified in December to ensure that the Fed moves deliberately over the next year when it finally decides to abandon a zero interest rate policy. An internal memo leaked by the Fed in June indicated that the FOMC anticipates that its benchmark Federal Funds Rate will increase to 1.26% over the next year, a level which would require three to four rate hikes before next summer.
""The committee does feel that moving in a timely fashion if the data and outlook justify such a move is a prudent thing to do because we will be able to move at a more gradual and measured pace,"" Yellen added. ""We fully expect that the economy will evolve in such a way that we can move at a very gradual pace and of course after we do so we will be watching very carefully whether our expectations are realized.""
Following Yellen's comments, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed watch placed the odds of a December rate hike at 60%, up from 52.3% a session earlier. Yields on the U.S. 2-Year also surged to an intraday-high of 0.82%, their highest level since 2011.
Currency traders also digested comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on the increasing likelihood that further stimulus measures could be needed by the ECB's Governing Council in order to stave off deflation. On Tuesday, Draghi argued that the ECB's comprehensive €1.1 trillion bond-buying program continues to have a favorable impact on credit availability for firms and households throughout the euro zone. The Governing Council is widely expected to increase the scope of the asset-purchasing program and lower interest rates when it meets next in December.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2015 09:00AM ET</span>","Bitcoin soars 25 percent, above $500 for first time since Aug. 2014","LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin soared over 25 percent on Wednesday to hit $500 for the first time since August last year, with demand from China cited as behind the surge in the web-based ""cryptocurrency"".
Bitcoin has been on a tear since dipping below $198 on the Bitstamp exchange  in the wake of the devaluation of China's yuan in late August, gaining over 150 percent in the following ten weeks to hit $502 on Wednesday.
So far it is up over 50 percent this week, putting it on track for its best weekly performance in two years. 
Various reasons are given by bitcoin experts for the latest rally, which still leaves the digital currency far below its 2013 peak above $1,100. 
Aside from demand from China, bitcoiners say an increased awareness in the blockchain technology underpinning bitcoin is encouraging buying, as well as a European Union court ruling last month that bitcoin should be exempt from value-added tax. 

Bitcoin is used as a vehicle for moving money around the world quickly and anonymously via the web without the need for third-party verification. That has made it controversial, but also attractive, to users ranging from drug dealers to those trying to circumvent capital controls in Greece and China.

USD/JPY traded at 120.82, down 0.26%, after the BoJ and household data and consumer prices and unemployment. AUD/USD changed hands at 0.7108, up 0.48%.
The BoJ decided by an 8 to 1 vote to leave the bank's policy target unchanged, as largely expected, indicating policymakers are confident that the economy will rebound in the coming months and that the underlying trend of prices continues to rise.
In the semi-annual Outlook Report due at 0600 GMT, the BoJ is likely to lower its economic forecasts for this fiscal year and may also push back the estimated timing of achieving its 2% inflation target again to ""around fiscal 2016"" from ""around the first half of fiscal 2016.""
The most likely scenario is the board will trim its GDP forecast. So far, the BoJ's assessment of the two main drivers of inflation has been unchanged: longer-term inflation expectations are rising and the negative output gap is unlikely to hurt the underlying price trend, which is backed by tight labor supply, because the GDP slump in April-June was mainly caused by an export drop.
Earlier in Japan, September household spending plunged 1.3% month-on-month, well below the 0.3% gain seen, national core CPI eased 0.1%, less than the 0.2% drop expected, and unemployment stayed steady at 3.4% as expected.
Consumer spending remains lackluster despite a gradual pickup in nominal wages and possibly due to the uncertainty over global growth and stock markets.
Expectations of further eased have ebbed and waned for another round of aggressive monetary easing to boost prices more than two years into a massive stimulus program of ¥80 trillion.
In Australia comes housing credit for September rose 0.8%, a faster pace that the 0.5% gain in August, while housing credit was up 0.6%, unchanged from the previous month. Producer prices gained 0.9% in the third quarter.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.01% to 97.35.
Overnight, the dollar pushed lower against the other major currencies on Thursday, after the release of disappointing U.S. data dampened optimism over the strength of the economy.
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index dropped 2.3% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 1.0%. Pending home sales in August fell by 1.4%, whose figure was revised from a previously reported drop of 1.4%.
The data came after the Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.5% in the three months to September, missing expectations for growth of 1.6%. The U.S. economy grew 3.9% in the previous quarter.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending October 24 increased by 1,000 to 260,000 from the previous week’s total of 259,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 4,000 to 263,000.

USD/JPY traded at 120.93, down 0.17%, after the household data and consumer prices and unemployment. AUD/USD changed hands at 0.7099, up 0.36%.
In Japan, September household spending plunged 1.3% month-on-month, well below the 0.3% gain seen, national core CPI eased 0.1%, less than the 0.2% drop expected, and unemployment stayed steady at 3.4% as expected.
Consumer spending remains lackluster despite a gradual pickup in nominal wages and possibly due to the uncertainty over global growth and stock markets.
Investors are now looking at the Bank of Japan one-day policy meeting on Friday as industrial output shows signs of life even as the central bank is expected to revise down growth and inflation forecasts in its semi-annual Outlook Report due the same day.
Expectations of further eased have ebbed and waned for another round of aggressive monetary easing to boost prices more than two years into a massive stimulus program of ¥80 trillion.
In Australia comes housing credit for September rose 0.8%, a faster pace that the 0.5% gain in August, while housing credit was up 0.6%, unchanged from the previous month. Producer prices gained 0.9% in the third quarter.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.08% to 97.29.
Overnight, the dollar pushed lower against the other major currencies on Thursday, after the release of disappointing U.S. data dampened optimism over the strength of the economy.
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index dropped 2.3% last month, disappointing expectations for a gain of 1.0%. Pending home sales in August fell by 1.4%, whose figure was revised from a previously reported drop of 1.4%.
The data came after the Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.5% in the three months to September, missing expectations for growth of 1.6%. The U.S. economy grew 3.9% in the previous quarter.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending October 24 increased by 1,000 to 260,000 from the previous week’s total of 259,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 4,000 to 263,000.
The dollar had strengthened broadly after Wednesday’s Federal Reserve statement said that officials might make a decision to raise interest rates at their December meeting.
The central bank kept rates on hold at its September meeting amid fears that a China-led slowdown in global growth could affect the U.S. economy.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0897 and 1.1095, before settling at 1.0978, up 0.0051 or 0.53% in Thursday's session. It came one day after the euro plunged more than 1% following the hawkish comments from the Federal Open Market Committee. Over the last month of trading, the euro is down by approximately 2.35% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0894, the low from October 28 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Investors continued to digest hawkish comments from the FOMC on Wednesday, when the U.S. central bank provided compelling indications that it could lift interest rates at its next meeting in December. The FOMC reframed its policy discussion on Wednesday, by including a line in its monetary policy statement that explicitly put a December lift-off back on the agenda. The line was conspicuously absent from its statement released after its previous meeting in September.
Citing weakness in the labor market and moderate economic growth, the FOMC voted to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a target range between zero and 0.25%. The rate has remained at a zero-bound range for more than five years after the Federal Reserve introduced a wide range of monetary easing measures aimed at rescuing the economy from near collapse.
The FOMC also downplayed the impact of the global economic slowdown on its policy decision in a dramatic reversal from its position last month. In September, the Fed opted to leave rates unchanged, after blaming headwinds from a slowing global economy for placing downward pressure on inflation. On Wednesday, the FOMC indicated that it will continue to monitor inflation developments closely as it weighs its decision.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Commerce said Thursday morning in advance estimates that Gross Domestic Product for the third quarter rose by 1.5%, slightly below consensus estimates of a 1.7% increase. By comparison, U.S. GDP in the second quarter increased by a 3.9% clip in its latest reading. An otherwise robust report was restrained by an inventory drag of minus-1.4%, which offset gains in domestic demand, consumer spending and equipment investment. Housing investment surged by 6.1% during the quarter, while final sales jumped by 3% overall.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.50% to an intraday low of 97.32, before closing at 97.36. It came one day after the index nearly surged 1% following the Fed's comments."

The U.S. Department of Labor will release two additional U.S. national employment reports before the FOMC's December meeting, providing the Fed with enough data on the state of the U.S. labor market to help guide their decision. On Thursday, the Commerce Department will release advance estimates for U.S. GDP for the third quarter, one day before it issues a report on Personal Income and Outlays for the month of September. Core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge for price growth, inched up 0.1 to 1.3% in August.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 1% following the FOMC's release to an intraday high of 97.89. Before the release the index stood at 96.64, down 0.40% on the session.

164,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 27, 2015 04:54PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls slightly, as traders await release of Fed statement","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell slightly on Tuesday, as currency traders await the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day October meeting on Wednesday afternoon for further indications on the timing of an interest rate hike by the U.S. central bank.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1031 and 1.1079, before settling at 1.1040, down 0.0016 and 0.15% on the session. The euro has closed under 1.11 against the dollar in each of the last four sessions. Last Thursday, the euro slumped more than 2% against the dollar after the European Central Bank sent strong indications that it is ready to introduce further stimulus measures before the end of the year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0854, the low from August 7 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Although the FOMC has hinted that it will likely hold short-term interest rates at its current near-zero level at the meeting, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has still not ruled out a rate hike. The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between zero and 0.25% for 55 consecutive meetings. At the FOMC's September monetary policy meeting, Yellen noted that the Fed will begin monetary policy normalization when it has seen ""further improvement in the labor market,"" and it is ""reasonably confident"" that inflation is moving toward its targeted goal of 2%.
Still, the Fed downgraded its median inflation forecasts at the meeting to 0.3% for the end of 2015, while lowering inflation expectations for the end of next year to 1.7%. The Fed now expects that inflation will not reach its 2.0% target until 2018. Days later, however, Yellen indicated that the timing could be appropriate to raise the Federal Funds Rate before the end of the year, as transitory effects from lower energy prices and a stronger dollar continued to recede.
Shortly after Yellen's comments, though, a dismal U.S. national employment report from September provided greater uncertainty with the timing of a rate hike. The U.S. Department of Labor will release two additional U.S. national employment reports before the FOMC's December meeting, providing the Fed with enough data on the state of the U.S. labor market to help guide their decision. As such, the CME Group's (O:CME) Fed Watch has forecast only a 5% chance of a rate hike in October, versus a 30% probability of one at the FOMC's meeting on Dec. 15-16.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.10% to an intraday high of 97.06, before closing slightly lower at 97.03.
Yields on the U.S. 2-Year, meanwhile, fell to two basis points to 0.621%. Yields on 2-year government bonds are highly sensitive to any changes in short-term interest rates."

The FOMC has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between zero and 0.25% for 55 consecutive meetings.
Yellen has indicated that the FOMC will take a ""data-driven approach,"" to its decision as it weighs whether to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The U.S. Department of Labor, meanwhile, will release two additional U.S. national employment reports before the FOMC's December meeting providing the Fed with enough data on the state of the U.S. labor market to help guide their decision.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department will release advance estimates for U.S. GDP for the third quarter, one day before it issues a report on Personal Income and Outlays for the month of September. Core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge for price growth, inched up 0.1 to 1.3% in August. The reading remains far below the Fed's target of 2% for long-term inflation.

186,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 23, 2015 05:40PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls to 2-month low, as investors brace for likely ECB easing","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell to a two-month low on Friday extending losses from a massive sell-off from the previous session, as currency traders continued to digest dovish comments from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on the likelihood of further stimulus measures to boost economic growth in the euro zone. 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0997 and 1.1140 before settling at 1.1012, down 0.0093 or 0.84% on the session. On Thursday, the euro tumbled more than 2% against the dollar, suffering its worst one day fall since January, after Draghi sent strong hints that the ECB will resume cutting interest rates, even as they remain in negative territory. 
At one point in Friday's session, EUR/USD slipped below 1.10 for the first time since August 11. For the week, the euro fell against the dollar by approximately 3%. The euro has closed down against its American counterpart in four of the last five sessions and six of the last eight. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0847, the low from Aug. 5 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15. 
Upon the completion of the ECB Governing Council's two-day meeting in Malta, Draghi hinted that the ECB is ready to slash interest rates from their current record-low of 0.5% and extend the scope of its comprehensive EUR 1.1 trillion asset-purchasing program. Citing weak growth among emerging market nations, Draghi also noted that the ECB could ramp bond purchases from its current level of EUR 60 billion a month. 
""The Governing Council is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate if warranted in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation,"" Draghi said. ""In particular, the Governing Council recalls that the asset purchase program provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration.""
Large-scale bond buying programs are intended to push interest rates down, as the price of government bonds move higher. Quantitative easing programs are also intended to depress currency values, as it becomes more appealing for domestic investors to invest in the region due to the lower rates.
Although the ECB initially planned on running the asset-purchasing program through September, 2016, Draghi reiterated on Thursday it could last longer if long-term inflation throughout the euro zone struggles to approach its targeted goal of 2%. 
Currency traders now turn their attention to next week's Federal Open Market Committee's October monetary policy for further clues on whether the U.S. central bank could raise short-term interest rates at some point in 2015. A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.7% to close at 97.18. In U.S. afternoon trading, the index surged to its highest level since mid-August.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1100 and 1.1351, before settling at 1.1106, down 2.05% on the session. With the dramatic sell-off, the euro dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since early-September. Heading into Thursday's announcement, currency traders were hesitant to complete any major transactions in anticipation of market-moving comments from Draghi. Previously, the pair failed to close more than 1% in a positive or negative direction in a single session dating back to Sept. 21.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0924, the low from Aug. 10 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Speaking at a press conference following the completion of the ECB Governing Council's two-day meeting in Malta, Draghi signaled that the ECB is prepared to cut interest rates in the euro zone from their current record-low of 0.5%. Draghi also implied that the ECB will likely ramp up its EUR 60 billion a month bond buying program, as early as its next policy meeting in Frankfurt on Dec. 3. The stimulus measures may help the ECB ward off risks of a prolonged economic slump in the euro zone, as weak economic growth among emerging market nations spills over into the global economy at large.
The ECB launched the EUR 1.1 trillion easing program in March in an effort to stimulate the euro zone's flagging economy. Large-scale bond buying programs are intended to push interest rates down, as the price of government bonds move higher. Quantitative easing programs are also intended to depress currency values, as it becomes more appealing for domestic investors to invest in the region due to the lower rates.
EUR/USD, for instance, slumped to near 10-year lows ahead of the launch of the program in March, before rallying when the Federal Reserve delayed lift-off on their plan to raise short-term interest rates. On Thursday, Draghi's comments pushed the pair below 1.12 to its lowest level in three weeks.
""The governing council is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate, if warranted, in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation,"" Draghi said at the press conference.
Investors also await next week's Federal Open Market Committee October monetary policy meeting for further clues on whether the U.S. central bank could lift short-term interest rates before the end of the year. Though the FOMC is not expected to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate this month, it could vote to begin policy normalization at the following meeting on Dec. 15-16.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, soared 1.43% to close at 96.43. It marked the strongest one-day move in the dollar in 2015."

While leaving rates unchanged, the Governing Council of the ECB has committed to use all the tools at its disposal to reawaken inflation rates in the Eurozone.
ECB President Mario Draghi has highlighted the resilience of the EUR/USD exchange rate, revealing a preference on the governing council of the ECB for the depreciation of the single currency to continue. While he has implicitly stated that the exchange rate of the euro is not a policy objective, the negative inflation rates in Europe persist.
The EUR/USD has fallen over 150 pips in the aftermath of the comments from the President of the ECB and the rate has still not stabilized. With October being a sluggish month for the most part the development is welcome news for retail FX brokers.

Just days before the Finance Magnates' London Summit is to discuss the alternatives for retail FX brokers in slow markets. The best thing that could happen is for foreign exchange volatility to return in full force so as to give the companies time to adjust to a new retail investor; a retail investor interested in multi-asset trading.
At the panel titled ""Multi-Asset Trading - The Next Frontier"" a number of key executives in the industry leading different types of efforts into the multi-asset space will gather to exchange ideas.
In the meantime, Mario Draghi will continue to exercise ""vigilance"" as he confirmed the words of his predecessor at the helm of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1324 and 1.1386 before settling at 1.1339, down 0.001 or 0.05% on the session.

On Thursday, the ECB's governing council will conclude its two-day meeting on the Mediterranean island, one of two annual meetings its holds each year outside Frankfurt. Last month, euro zone inflation fell by 0.1% from its August level, representing the first time it has decelerated all year.
When the governing council last met in September, ECB president Mario Draghi noted that while the central bank expects the economic recovery to continue, it anticipates that the path to resurgence could take longer than initially forecasted. Citing weakness in the emerging markets, Draghi remarked that the slowdown weighed heavily on global growth and foreign demand for exports throughout the euro zone. Although the ECB may extend the scope of its comprehensive €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program, many economists in Europe do not expect the ECB to make any decisive changes at the meeting.
In September, Draghi said the ECB will ""use all the instruments within its mandate,"" to stimulate growth, while adding the bond buying initiative provides it with ""sufficient flexibility"" to adjust ""the size, composition and duration of the program."" While the ECB has the option of increasing the size of its monthly bond purchases to €80 billion a month at the meeting, doing so might provide ammunition for Draghi's critics who do not favor the program.
Investors also await next week's Federal Open Market Committee October monetary policy meeting for further hints on whether the U.S. central bank could lift short-term interest rates before the end of the year. Though the FOMC is not expected to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at the meeting, it could vote to begin policy normalization at its next meeting on Dec. 15-16.
Without the release of any major economic reports this week, the Federal Reserve will weigh the data from the last month since it met last in mid-September. At the meeting, four members of the FOMC voted to wait until 2016 for lift-off. The labor market added only 142,000 non-farm payrolls in September, while long-term inflation remained soft at 1.3%. A Fed rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields.

The popularity of the Chinese yuan has soared to new heights on EBS’ trading platform, having achieved the distinction of being the third most traded currency on its platform, according to a recent Reuters report.
The yuan’s surge is notable given its supplanting of traditional pairs such as the USD/CHF and EUR/JPY on one of the main independent venues where banks trade currency baskets. According to officials at EBS Brokertec, the insatiable appetite for the yuan or renminbi has been upwards of 50% YoY. The update is commensurate with the recent announcement by SWIFT’s currency tracker, which had showed the yuan jump up to the number four slot in day-to-day payments on a global scale.
The revelation comes on the back of renewed pushes at several International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings this month for the yuan to be added into the fund's benchmark currency basket – the stance adopted by the Chinese government was the advent of recent reforms pushing it closer towards qualification on the basket.

In a bid to capture interest in yuan trading, onshore markets are also rumored to be extending their trading hours to 15:30 GMT to better overlap with European trading hours. However, the push towards IMF benchmark qualification for the yuan is hardly universal, with several international critics, namely the United States, that have argued that currency controls in China are a prohibiting force towards this end.
According to Jessica Roberts, Head of Strategic Currencies at EBS in London, in a recent statement on the yuan’s ascension, ""We have seen the number of counterparties who are trading spot CNH increase by 50 percent on a daily basis over the past year. It is now the third most traded currency on EBS, although it is still some way behind the euro and yen (dollar pairs).""
""We see it as operating, transparent and deep enough to trade across a 24-hour period. We really regard it now as a major currency. However, one reason why the yuan may not be included in the SDR would be the credit constraints on the Chinese banks. You do have these growth challenges show up from time to time. Chinese banks may need ISDAs with international banks, as they need to establish relationships with counterparties,” added EBS's Head of Markets, Darryl Hooker, in an accompanying statement.

218,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2015 05:57PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ticks up, in cautious trade ahead of key ECB meeting","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose moderately erasing most of the losses from a session earlier, as currency traders await the European Central Bank's key meeting on Thursday in Malta.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1324 and 1.1386 on Tuesday before settling at 1.1348, up 0.19% on the session. Since Labor Day, EUR/USD has remained in a holding pattern between 1.10 and 1.16, while hardly experiencing any sharp fluctuations. In fact, over the last month of trading the currency pair has only moved more than 1% in a positive or negative direction once in 20 sessions after falling by 1.03% on September 21. During that span, the euro is up by roughly 0.40% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1103, the low from Sept. 23 and was met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
For the second consecutive session, investors were hesitant to make any major moves ahead of the ECB's monetary policy meeting in Malta on Thursday. In September, inflation in the euro zone fell by 0.1% from its level a month earlier, marking the first time it dropped below zero since March.
During the same month, the ECB launched a long-term €60 billion a month quantitative easing program aimed at stimulating economic growth throughout the zone. Draghi also noted last month that the ECB could extend the quantitative easing beyond September, 2016, if needed. Many prominent economists in Europe do not expect the ECB to make any decisive changes to the program at the meeting. Any signal from Draghi that the ECB may need to increase the scope of the bond buying initiative could provide a tacit admission that the quantitative easing program has proven to be less successful than he initially anticipated.
While the launch of QE throughout the euro zone pushed EUR/USD down considerably at the start of the year, it has rallied in recent months as the Federal Reserve has continued to delay an inevitable interest rate hike. Policy accommodation from the Fed is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields. The pair has gained approximately 8.5% since mid-March when it fell below 1.05, amid speculation that a rate hike from the Fed could be imminent.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.20% to an intraday low of 94.62 on Tuesday, before paring some of the losses in afternoon trading. The index closed at 94.89, down 0.06%, halting a four-day winning streak.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2015 05:19AM ET</span>",Smartphones put power to deal currencies into retail traders' hands,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON (Reuters) - Once the preserve of big international banks, smartphones are putting the power to deal currencies into the hands of a new cohort of traders, who can make a fortune -- or lose their shirt -- on the bus to work. 
Retail foreign exchange trading has grown rapidly in recent years, but the image has been of a lone trader in front of a computer screen. Smartphones, owned by around half the world's adults, are changing that. 
Mobile trading makes up about 60 percent of transactions, up from 10 percent four years ago, at London-based broker Trade 212, whose app has been downloaded over a million times. More than a fifth of clients trade only on smartphones or tablets. 
""We are seeing a big number of clients who are not only mobile first, but mobile only,"" said Ivan Ashminov, Trade 212's co-founder. 
Like others, Trade 212 offers demo accounts allowing users, largely male and mostly aged between 25 and 45, to practise with fake money. Many have no previous trading experience, Ashminov said. 
Faheem Bismal, a 32-year-old father of two from Glasgow, sold his chain of convenience stores and restaurants two years ago to focus on property investment and trading currencies. He trades on broker FXCM's smartphone app on the school run and in bed before he turns out the light. 
When he only traded on his desktop and could not check the market when he was out and about, he was less successful, Bismal said. But he warns that the ease and accessibility of trading apps can be dangerous. 
""I see guys sitting on their phones just tapping away, being in and out of the market within seconds or minutes ... and losing all their money. If you're going to use the app you have to use it very sensibly.""
In 2013, the Bank for International Settlements estimated the value of retail currency trading at about $185 billion a day, or 3.5 percent of the market. Industry analysis website Finance Magnates reckons that figure is now closer to $320 billion. Smartphones, it seems, are helping drive growth. 
Almost 40 percent of trading at IG, one of the world's biggest retail FX platforms, is done on mobile devices, up from around 20 percent three years ago. In April, the firm became the first to offer a trading app on the Apple (O:AAPL) Watch, which vibrates when a user-set price is reached. 
GAMIFICATION
Some critics say ""gamification"" has made some trading apps appear more like harmless fun than opportunities to lose large sums. They argue it entices people with no knowledge of markets to expose themselves to risks of which they are not fully aware. 
When the Swiss National Bank removed its currency cap in January, many retail traders suffered heavy losses, having held highly leveraged positions on the euro against the Swiss franc. Most of the retail traders Reuters spoke to about their losses had used smartphones for at least some of their trading.
But some argue that rather than encouraging reckless gambling, the new generation of apps, designed for smartphone users rather than modified from desktop sites, provide a less complex, safer environment for retail traders. 
Flick A Trade is one trading app that looks and feels like a traditional computer game, complete with tense music and sound effects. It offers trading with ""funny money"", while in ""real money"" mode trading sessions are limited to 3,000 pounds ($4,600), with losses not able to exceed bets.
""Over the years I have seen numerous black swan events ... which wreck not only retail investors but many companies, big and small, offering leveraged trading,"" said Flick A Trade founder Kerem Ozelli. 
Mobile trading apps can also give traders access to the same technology that until now has been reserved for the big banks.
""The lines between retail and institutional trading are becoming way more blurry,"" said Jannick Malling, CEO of Tradable, a company that allows users to trade directly from news and analysis apps rather than via a separate broker's app. 

""Back in the day, only the institutions had access to the best tools in the marketplace ... and that's becoming completely democratised."" ($1 = 0.6466 British Pounds)

229,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 19, 2015 05:50PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls mildly, ahead of ECB policy meeting later this week","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Monday, as investors await a critical meeting by the European Central Bank later this week for hints from Mario Draghi of a potential expansion of a comprehensive €1.1 trillion bond buying program.
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1306 and 1.1379 before settling at 1.1327, up 0.28% on the session. After nearly surging to 1.15 last week, the euro has now closed down against the dollar in three of four sessions. Over the last month of trading, though, the euro is still up by roughly 0.2% versus its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1170, the low from October 5 and was likely met with resistance at 1.1496, the high from Oct. 15.
Currency traders were hesitant to make any major moves ahead of the ECB's monetary policy meeting in Malta on Thursday. In September, inflation in the euro zone fell by 0.1% from its level a month earlier, marking the first time it dropped below zero since March.
During the same month, the ECB launched a long-term €60 billion a month quantitative easing program aimed at stimulating economic growth throughout the zone. Draghi also noted in September that the ECB could extend the quantitative easing beyond September, 2016, if needed. Many prominent economists in Europe do not expect the ECB to make any decisive changes to the program at the meeting. Still, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny argued last week that further action could be required to help the bank reach its inflation target. One option could be to increase the bond purchases to €80 billion a month before the end of the year.
Elsewhere, weak data on third quarter GDP growth  in China spilled over into global foreign exchange markets during Monday's trade. In overnight trading, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that GDP growth grew at 6.9% for the third quarter, decelerating at the slowest pace in more than six years. It marks the slowest period of growth in the world's second-largest economy since the first quarter of 2009 when Chinese GDP rose by 6.2%. The dismal reading could add pressure on the People's Bank of China to introduce fresh stimulus measures following its shocking devaluation of the yuan in August.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.25% on Monday to an intraday high of 95.05 before settling at 94.97. The index has closed higher in four straight sessions."

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1335 and 1.1395, before settling at 1.1347, down 0.0040 or 0.35% on the session. EUR/USD has remained in a holding pattern over the last several weeks, devoid of any major fluctuations. Since September 21, the pair has traded between a level of 1.11 and 1.15, marking a span of 19 sessions. During that period, EUR/USD has failed to move 1% in either a positive or negative direction in a single trading day. As a result, the euro is only up modestly against the dollar over the last month – by a margin of approximately 0.75%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1133, the low from Oct.1 and was likely met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
On Friday morning, Eurostat reported that the Consumer Price Index in the euro zone fell 0.1% on an annual basis in September, in line with flash estimates. The persistent downturn in energy prices continued to weigh on inflationary pressures. Core CPI, which strips out volatile items such as energy, food and tobacco prices, remained 0.9% above its level from 12 months ago, unchanged from August.
The ECB could extend the scope of its €1.1 trillion quantitative easing program when it meets again next Thursday.
Meanwhile, currency traders continued to digest the release of weak U.S. inflation data on Thursday, when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said consumer prices fell by 0.2% in September, following a 0.1% decline a month earlier. The Fed Reserve would like to see inflation firm considerably before it raises short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. 
Elsewhere, The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index surged more than five points to 92.1 for October, falling in the high end of a consensus range between 87.5 and 93.0. Last week, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart indicated that he will be watching consumer sentiment closely as he weighs whether the U.S. central bank should raise short-term rates before the end of the year. 
A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in attempts to capitalize on higher yields. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.4% to an intraday high of 94.81. Earlier in the week, the index dipped below 94 to fall to a fresh monthly low, significantly below its intraday high of 96.64 on Oct. 1.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose two basis points to 2.03%, completing the sharpest two-day increase in two weeks. Government bond yields move in an inverse direction as bond prices.

254,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 15, 2015 05:26PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls sharply, as weak inflation dampens rate hike possibility ","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Thursday, as the release of soft U.S. inflation data for September added support for dovish arguments regarding a delayed interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve until at least the start of 2016.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1363 and 1.1496, before settling at 1.1374, down 0.0100 or 0.87% on the session. At one point, though, the euro surged to its highest level against the dollar before falling considerably throughout the session. The euro has still closed higher against the dollar in seven of the last 10 sessions. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up more than 0.5% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.117, the low from October 6 and was met with resistance at 1.1625, the high from Aug. 25.
On Thursday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said its Consumer Price Index fell by 0.2% for the month of September, in line with consensus estimates. A month earlier, the prior reading fell by 0.1% in August. On a year-over-year basis, the headline reading is identical to its level 12 months ago.
There were signals throughout the report of weakness in the energy sector restraining inflationary pressures overall. For the month, energy prices declined by 4.7%, while gasoline prices plummeted by 9.0% in September. The dip in energy prices pulled down transportation costs, which fell by 2.3% on the month.
The effects were reflected in the modest gains in Core CPI Inflation, which strips out food and energy prices. On a monthly basis, Core CPI  rose by 0.2% from its level in August, while increasing 1.9% over the last year. Still, Core PCE Inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge for long-term inflation remains under 1.5%. The Fed would like to see long-term inflation move toward its targeted goal 2% before it raises its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.
Last month at an appearance at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated that the Fed could raise short-term interest rates this year barring unforeseen developments over the next several weeks. Yellen also noted that the inflation shortfall is likely to be transitory, as one-off factors such as lower energy prices and weaker imports due to a stronger dollar abate. Yellen added that inflation should reach the Fed's 2% target when the labor market returns to full employment. Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed's goal for every month over the last three years.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1344 and 1.1411 before settling at 1.1383, up 0.0024 or 0.20% on the session. At one point, the euro moved above 1.14 against the dollar for the first time since Sept. 18. EUR/USD has closed higher in three of the last four and six of the last nine sessions.

In a speech at the National Association for Business Economics annual conference on Tuesday morning, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president James Bullard stood firm on his position that economic conditions nationwide are strong enough to allow the Federal Open Market Committee to approve an initial rate hike. While Bullard noted that liftoff is appropriate despite a litany of challenges, he emphasized that the challenges are not robust enough to guide policy decisions. In addition, Bullard argued that strict inflation targeting should not compel the Fed to hold rates at a zero-bound range, even if the U.S. central bank doesn't hit its 2% target in the near future. Shortly after the FOMC voted to hold rates at its current near-zero level last month, Bullard asserted he would have voted against the decision in a scathing dissent. 
Investors also continued to digest relatively hawkish comments from a host of central bankers over the weekend at the International Monetary Fund's Annual Meeting in Lima, urging the Fed to stop putting off an initial rate hike. Central bankers from two Emerging Markets in Asia believe a rate hike will reduce uncertainty in global foreign exchange markets, while Germany finance minister Jens Weidmann contends that a rate increase will lead to a stronger global economy. Days earlier, Weidmann told German newspaper Die Welt that conditions responsible for causing adverse effects to the global economy can intensify when ""interest rates remain persistently low."" 
Foreign exchange traders await the release a steady stream of economic data later this week for further indications on the strength of the global economy. On Wednesday, a report from EuroStat is expected to show that industrial production in the euro zone declined by 0.5% for the month of August.

The FOMC meets next on Oct. 27-28, before meeting for the final time this year on Dec. 15-16.
On Monday morning, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart indicated that the FOMC will have more economic data at its disposal in December to make the decision versus its meeting later this month. Last week, Lockhart said he will keep a close eye on U.S. consumer spending data as he weighs his decision.

On Wednesday, a report from EuroStat is expected to show that industrial production in the euro zone declined by 0.5% for the month of August. It comes one month after industrial production rose by 0.6%, halting a three-month streak of losses. Inflation data will also be released on both continents toward the end of the week.

296,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Oct 11, 2015 11:30AM ET</span>",Trading Emerging Markets Currencies is Only for the Braves!,"By The Bloggers

This article is written by Otto Fassheber Jorand, Financial Advisor at Golder Broker S.A.
According to the Hawley Economic Theory, profit is a reward for risk taken in business. The higher the risk in business, the greater the potential financial reward is for the business owner.
Trading emerging markets (EM) currencies nowadays could be the riskiest trade out there, and following the Hawley Theory, a risk which may be rewarded with the biggest potential profit you ever seen. But only the brave can get involved now on the market.
In the last 12 months every EM currency has fallen against the US dollar. Some currencies like the Brazilian real, the ruble and the Colombian peso have fallen more than 30 percent over the past year for some of the worst global selloffs.
But EM problems have been building for years, fed by credit bubbles, plunging commodity prices, unstable domestic politics, China’s economic slowdown, and current account deficits. These are just some of the factors that have sent EM currencies into freefall.

Otto Fassheber Jorand
The Brazilian real began the year with a change of 2.5 reals per dollar, and at the end of September the Brazilian currency touched its lowest rate in history, trading for 4.25 R$ per dollar. 
The Institute for International Finance (IIF) estimates that EM will lose about 540 billion dollars on capital exit this year; it’s the biggest 'hot money' withdrawal since the 2008 Lehman Brothers default. Borrowing costs have climbed above the levels seen during 2013’s 'taper tantrum' as investors run away from risk punishing hard EM government bonds.
So why would someone be so brave, or so dumb, to fight that war?
The answer is the simplest: because it is cheap!
Let’s get back to basic instincts. The main objective of any trader in the world is making profit by buying low and selling high. That EM currencies are extremely undervalued is something very clear, but expecting a rebound in the near future is the hard part of the deal.
Actually it is not about trying to find the bottom for EM currencies, it’s about feeling comfortable with the risks taken and the potential rewards involved. It’s a matter of faith and appetite for risk.
So where are investors getting lost?
After the 1997 Asian crisis, EM policymakers built up foreign exchange reserves large enough to absorb and deter speculative attacks on their currencies. Following the IIF estimates, EM central banks have foreign reserves enough to handle a 20-year storm before running out of cash.
Commodity prices are closer to their production costs- after a long way down, the commodities macro cycles could be turning, as suppliers are closing production facilities. And, a small rebound on the demand side could take time to be covered by producers eventually pushing prices higher.
Carry trading – the high interest rates offered for EM currencies deposits is already a hedge position against currency devaluation, and the swap rates paid on holding EM currencies against the dollar could cover a great part of the risk. Getting 1 USD borrowed at 0.25% annual interest rate in the US whereas the investor could lend the same money in Brazil for about 15% annual interest rate, which means that if the currency rate didn’t change during that period, the investor would made about 14% profit in a year.
The FED interest rate decision and China growth, the big data…
The China economic slowdown has affected all EM currencies, when commodity prices were put under strong bullish pressure, but at the same time, raw material exporters took advantage of the EM currencies devaluation. Colombian coffee exporters lost about 12% in the last 12 months, due to the coffee price devaluation based on the dollar, but if we take into consideration that the Colombian peso has devalued over 40% in the same period against the dollar, exporters still have domestic currency based benefits.
Going Forward
Expectations are that the Federal Reserve will soon embark on the first interest rate increase since 2006, threatening to lure capital away from developing nations. This combined with a soft landing in China poses significant risks to EM currencies, but as I have argued, this is all about confidence.
Investors may see a FED rate rise decision as something positive, or at least a better forecast for the Chinese economy. One of the main reasons why the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged in its last meeting in September was worry over China and EM markets (please read last article), so a rate rise could be read by investors as a bright light over the world economy growth forecast.
There are too many cards on the table, but only the brave are willing to make a move right now. They will pay the ultimate price or get the ultimate prize… GERONIMO!!!!

In particular, concern about China was key in the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates near zero, minutes from the last meeting released Thursday show.
“Many [officials] acknowledged that recent global economic and financial developments may have increased the downside risks to economic activity somewhat,” the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee said.
The relatively dovish minutes from the September meeting may bolster arguments that the FOMC could wait as long as March of next year before lift-off. Previously, it was widely believed the FOMC could raise rates either this month or when it meets in December. A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback looking to capitalize on higher yields.

Earlier Thursday data showed that the number of people filing first time claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. last week fell to the lowest level in almost 42 years, indicating that the labor markets is continuing to tighten despite the slowdown in job creation.

The currency pair traded between a low of 1.1238 and a high of 1.1326 before settling at 1.1275, up 0.0038 or 0.33% on the session. The euro surged to two-week highs shortly after the release, before paring most of the gains late in the trading day. The pair has remained in a holding pattern over the last two weeks of trading, reflecting investors' hesitancy to make any moves before both the European Central Bank and the FOMC meet later this month. EUR/USD has failed to close by more than 1% in a positive or negative direction over the last 13 sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1103, the low from Sept.23 and was met with resistance at 1.1460, the high from Sept.18.
During its September monetary policy meeting, the FOMC voted nearly unanimously to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged, marking the 55th consecutive meeting that it decided to hold rates at its current near-zero level. Citing mounting concerns related to slowing growth in China along with a host of emerging market economies, the Federal Reserve decided the timing was not appropriate to normalize monetary policy. The deceleration in economic growth, according to the minutes, led to a spike in the dollar, which the Fed believes is holding down inflation.
Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed's targeted goal of 2% in every month for the last three years. The FOMC also expressed trepidation that a premature rate hike could ""erode the credibility"" of its inflation objective, if long-term inflation stayed below 2% for a prolonged period. In September, the Fed forecasted that its preferred gauge of inflation will not reach its 2% target until at least the end of 2018.
The relatively dovish minutes from the September meeting may bolster arguments that the FOMC could wait as long as March of next year before lift-off. Previously, it was widely believed the FOMC could raise rates either this month or when it meets in December.

319,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 07, 2015 04:43PM ET</span>",EUR/USD falls slightly ahead of the release of the FOMC's Sept. minutes,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Wednesday, as currency traders await the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting for clues on whether the U.S. central bank will raise short-term interest rates before the end of the year. 
The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1212 and 1.1284, before settling at 1.1237, down 0.0036 or 0.32% on the session. Despite Wednesday's slight losses, the euro has still closed higher against the dollar in seven of the last 10 sessions. EUR/USD also closed above 1.12 for the fourth time in the last five trading days. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up by roughly 0.85% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from Sept. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1446, the high from Sept. 18. 
On Thursday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its September meeting, one widely viewed as one of the most anticipated in recent memory due to the uncertainty surrounding a potential interest rate hike. At the meeting, the FOMC voted to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current rate between zero and 0.25%, marking the 55th consecutive meeting it decided to keep the rate unchanged at a near-zero level. While one member of the FOMC, Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker voted for an increase of 0.25%, four others felt that the Fed should wait until 2016 before raising short-term rates. By comparison in June, only two FOMC members were in favor of delaying a rate hike until next year. 
While the FOMC indicated that it had seen significant improvements in the U.S. economy since it last met in July, it also expressed concern that significant headwinds from weakness in China and the global economy overall could restrain domestic growth. Following the meeting, Fed chair Janet Yellen said it was likely the FOMC could hike rates by the end of the year barring unforeseen events over the next several weeks. Last week, though, a dismal U.S. jobs report for September could have planted seeds of doubt among FOMC members whether a rate hike this year should be appropriate. 
On Tuesday, San Francisco Fed president John Williams reiterated that he still believes the FOMC will raise rates in 2015. Even so, Williams expects the pace of rate hikes to be the ""most gradual tightening cycle in the history of the Fed."" 
A rate hike is viewed as bullish for the dollar as foreign investors pile into the greenback in attempts to capitalize on higher-yields abroad. 
Elsewhere, the International Monetary Fund said while the reverberations from the prolonged Greek bailout talks have been ""limited,"" since an accord was reached over the summer, tensions could resurface if political uncertainties re-emerge. In addition, the IMF downgraded its 2015 inflation outlook for the euro zone to 0.2%, slightly below the European Central Bank's projection of 0.4%. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year rose three basis points on Wednesday to 2.065%. Earlier on Wednesday, the bond yields reached an intraday-high of 2.086%, its highest level in a week.

The Bank of Japan board voted to keep its current monetary base target steady in an 8 to 1 vote on Wednesday, saying the economy continues in recovery mode.
The BoJ's asset purchase target is ¥80 trillion annually with board member Takahide Kiuchi dissenting again on the amount after suggesting earlier this year a level around ¥45 trillion.
There has been speculation the BoJ may be considering further easing, though the board has contended thta underlying inflation is rising and a slump in factory output is not serious enough to derail the path to a modest economic recovery and 2% inflation.

331,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 06, 2015 05:20PM ET</span>","EUR/USD surges amid widening U.S. deficit, lower IMF growth forecast","Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged more than 0.75%, amid downbeat forecasts from the International Monetary Fund on global economic growth over the next year and a widening of the U.S. trade deficit in August.
The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1173 and a high of 1.1280, before settling at 1.1272, up 0.0085 or 0.76% on the session. The euro has now closed above 1.12 against the dollar three times in the last four sessions. In addition, the euro has also closed higher against its American in nine of the last 12 sessions since suffering a four-day losing streak in late-September. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up by more than 1% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from Sept. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.11460, the high from Sept. 18.
On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund, a Washington-based organization mandated to ensure the stability of the international monetary system, slashed its global economic growth forecast for the second time in 2015. Citing weakness in China and soft commodity prices, the IMF estimated that the world's economy will grow at 3.1% this year and 3.6% in 2016. Both estimates are 0.2% below the IMF's July forecasts. In April, the IMF downgraded its 2015 forecast by 0.4% and its growth forecast for 2016 by 0.2%.
When projecting short-term growth in the U.S., the IMF estimates that its economy will grow 2.6% this year and by 2.8% in 2016. The IMF also expects growth in the euro zone to increase by 1.5% and 1.6% in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In Japan, the organization projects economic growth of 0.6% this year and a full 1.0% in 2016. The IMF also forecasts a sharp deceleration in growth among emerging markets, as commodity prices continue to plummet. In its latest forecast, the IMF cut growth in emerging markets to 4% for 2015.
""Prospects across the main countries and regions remain uneven,"" the IMF said in its October, 2015, World Economic Outlook. ""Relative to last year, the recovery in advanced economies is expected to pick up slightly, while activity in emerging market and developing economies is projected to slow for the fifth year in a row, primarily reflecting weaker prospects for some large emerging market economies and oil-exporting countries.""
Separately, the U.S. trade deficit soared by 15.6% to $48.3 billion in August, amid a surge in imports from new iPhone orders. For the month, U.S. imports increased 1.2% to $233.4 billion. Exports, meanwhile, slumped to $185.1 billion in August, its lowest level since October, 2012, reflecting a weakness in foreign demand along with continuing strength in the dollar.
Elsewhere, German factory orders in August unexpectedly fell by 1.8% on the month, significantly below estimates for a 0.5% gain. The German economy is reeling following a Volkswagen (XETRA:VOWG) emissions scandal that surfaced last month, which could impact as many as 11 million automobiles throughout the world.

343,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 05, 2015 05:21PM ET</span>","EUR/USD down mildly, amid poor economic data on both sides of Atlantic","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Monday to halt a three-day winning streak, amid disappointing service sector data on both sides of the Atlantic. 
The currency pair traded between a low of 1.1174 and a high of 1.1289 before settling at 1.1185, down 0.0026 or 0.24% on the session. Previously, the euro closed higher against the dollar in six of the last eight sessions and eight of the last 10. Still, the euro is relatively flat versus its American counterpart over the last month of trading, up by roughly 0.37% during that span. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from September 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1442, the high from Sept. 17. 
The Institute of Supply Management reported on Monday morning that its non-manufacturing purchasing index dipped to 56.9 in September from a level of 59.0 the previous month. It also fell below consensus estimates of a 58.0 reading. Following two consecutive months of stellar reports over the summer, the September report was dragged down by weakness in business activity and new orders. In July, the index surged to a 59.6 level, its strongest reading in 18 years. 
Separately, there are signs that growth in the services sector is decelerating after the Services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 55.1 last month, below consensus expectations of a 55.8 reading. Within the report, there were signs of weakness in growth in new orders and production overall.
In addition, the daily spending habits of Americans were virtually unchanged last month according to Gallup's U.S. Consumer Spending Measure for September. During the month, American consumers averaged about $88 per day, just below an $89 average in August. 
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said non-farm payrolls for the month of September increased by 142,000, significantly below consensus estimates from analysts of a 203,000 gain. The figure also fell well below low end of estimates of a 180,000 increase. The unemployment rate remained steady at 5.1%, while the labor participation rate declined by 0.2% to 62.4%.
In Europe, the euro zone services PMI in September slumped to a seven-month low at 53.7 slightly below analysts' forecasts for a reading of 54.0. Euro zone employment, meanwhile, moved higher for the 11th straight month, amid solid increases in Germany, Spain and Ireland. European Commission head Pierre Moscovici, however, issued a warning to Spain on Monday after he said projections show the nation could miss its headline fiscal targets in both 2015 and 2016. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other currencies, gained more than 0.25% to an intraday high of 96.29 before closing at 96.20 on Monday's session. The index rose by 0.19% for its third win in the last five sessions. "

354,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 02, 2015 05:11PM ET</span>","EUR/USD posts moderate gains, amid gloomy U.S. jobs report","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose moderately on Friday extending gains from a recent hot streak, as a gloomy U.S. jobs report for September strengthened dovish arguments for a delayed rate by the Federal Reserve.
The currency pair traded in a brought range between 1.1150 and 1.1317 before settling at 1.1211, up 0.0016 or 0.14% on the session. At one point, the euro reached its highest level against the dollar since September 21. The euro has now closed higher against its American counterpart in seven of the last nine sessions. The euro ended the week against the dollar, though, virtually unchanged only gaining roughly 0.18% over the last five trading days.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1088, the low from Sept. 4 and was met with resistance at 1.1460, the high from Sept. 18.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said non-farm payrolls for the month of September increased by 142,000, significantly below consensus estimates from analysts of a 203,000 gain. The figure also fell well below low end of estimates of a 180,000 increase. Severe declines in manufacturing and mining employment restrained overall job gains as the sectors lost 9,000 and 13,000 positions respectively. A month earlier, the manufacturing industry lost 18,000 jobs in August, while mining positions nationwide decreased by 22,000.
There were other signs of weakness within the dreary report. After surging by 0.3% on a monthly basis in August, hourly wages remained unchanged in September. Analysts expected hourly earnings to tick up on the month by 0.2%. On a yearly basis, hourly wages were only up 2.2% over the last 12 months. The labor participation rate also fell by 0.2% to 62.4%, providing indications that that the labor market is shrinking. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 5.1% in line with analysts' expectations.
The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader gauge of the employment situation in the U.S., fell 0.3% to 10.0%. The rate, which is a preferred measure of unemployment by Fed chair Janet Yellen, tracks the number of workers marginally attached to the labor force as well as part-time workers. Last September, the rate peaked at 11.7%. Marginally attached workers are defined as those who are not working or not looking for work, but have looked for work over the last 12 months.
Last month, the Federal Open Market Committee sent strong indications that it wanted to see continued improvement in the labor market before it hiked short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell to an intraday low of 1.904%, dropping below 2% for the first time since late-August. At Friday's close, yields on 10-year Treasuries stood at 1.993%, down roughly five basis points on the day.

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1158 and a high of 1.1261, before settling at 1.1177, down 0.0072 or 0.64%. EUR/USD remained in a tight holding pattern for the month, not falling below 1.10 or moving above 1.15. For the month of September, the pair was relatively flat falling by only 0.05% over the last 30 days of trading. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from Sept. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.146, the high from Sept. 18. 
On Wednesday morning, payroll processing firm ADP said U.S. non-farm private employment rose by 200,000 in September, above analysts' expectations of a 190,000 gain. In August, the economy added only 186,000 non-farm private positions, a figure that was downwardly revised from a previous total of 190,000. By comparison, though, the initial government report only showed a spike of 140,000 jobs last month. 
The reading provides optimism for Friday's highly-anticipated national employment report, one which is expected to be closely watched by the Fed. Earlier this month, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated that it wanted to see further improvement in the labor market before it rose its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nearly a decade. In brief remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Community Banking Conference on Wednesday, Yellen did not comment on the Fed's current monetary policy. Last week, Yellen indicated that the Fed will likely raise rates before the end of the year barring unforeseen developments in the global economy. 
A rate hike by the FOMC is viewed as bullish for the dollar, as it could spur foreign investors to pile into the greenback to take advantage of higher yields. 
When the U.S. Department of Labor releases its September jobs report on Friday, it is expected to show that the economy added 203,000 non-farm payrolls this month, up from a subpar gain of 173,000 in August. Restrained by weakness in energy equipment and soft exports, manufacturing jobs fell by 17,000 last month. A downturn in commodities also resulted in a decline of 9,000 in mining positions. The losses were offset by a 33,000 gain in professional and business service jobs, as well as an 11,000 rise in temporarily held positions. 
Elsewhere, Eurostat, the statistical body of the European Union, reported that the annual rate of inflation declined by 0.1% in September, below estimates of a flat reading. It marked the first time in six months that deflation in the euro zone moved lower on an annual basis.

388,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 29, 2015 05:56PM ET</span>","EUR/USD relatively flat, ahead of release of euro zone inflation data ","Investing.com -- EUR/USD remained relatively flat on Tuesday, as investors showed hesitancy to make any major moves ahead of Wednesday's monthly report on inflation throughout the euro zone. 
The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1195 and a high of 1.1281, before settling at 1.1250, up 0.0005 or 0.04% on the session. The euro has now closed over 1.12 against the dollar over each of the last three sessions and four of the last five. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up modestly against the dollar by less than 1%. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from September 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1442, the high from Sept. 17. 
Currency traders await the release of critical inflation data from the euro zone on Wednesday for further indications on the strength of the global economy. Analysts expect to see a 0.1% gain for the month, following a 0.1% increase in August. 
In the meantime, investors continue to digest strong indications from the Federal Open Market Committee that it will likely raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at either its October or December meeting. On Monday, New York Fed president William Dudley told the Wall Street Journal that the Fed is on track to hike rates before the end of the year and that it could reach its targeted goal for inflation at some point in 2016.
It followed hawkish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen last week on the acceleration of inflationary pressures, as the labor markets return to full employment. In an appearance at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Yellen noted that the inflation shortfall is likely to be transitory, as one-off factors such as lower energy prices and weaker imports due to a stronger dollar evaporate.
Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed under the Fed's targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. An interest rate hike is viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets. 
Economists will keep a close eye on Friday's September national employment report for further signals on the decline of slack in the labor markets. They will receive a harbinger of sorts on Wednesday when the ADP Research Institute releases its September National Employment Report. Analysts expect the report to show that the private sector added 190,000 nonfarm jobs during the month, following a similar gain of 190,000 in August. 
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell more than four basis points on Tuesday to an intraday low of 2.049, its lowest level for the month of September.

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1147 and a high of 1.1248, before settling at 1.1245, up 0.0046 or 0.41% on the session. Following a four-day losing streak last week, the euro has now closed higher against the dollar in four of the last five sessions. During a volatile stretch over the last five weeks, EUR/USD has traded as low as 1.10 and reached as high as 1.171. Over that span, the pair is down by roughly 1%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1088, the low from September 4 and was met with resistance at 1.146, the high from Sept. 18.
The dollar fell considerably on Monday in spite of continuing indications from the Federal Reserve that it will raise short-term interest rates at some point over the next several months. On Monday morning, New York Fed president William Dudley told the Wall Street Journal that the Fed is on track to hike rates before the end of the year and could reach its targeted goal for inflation at some point in 2016. In its inflation forecasts earlier this month, the Fed estimated that inflation would reach 1.7% by the end of next year and not hit 2.0% until 2018.
It came days after Fed chair Janet Yellen offered her first personal endorsement of a 2015 rate hike since July during hawkish remarks in an appearance at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst last Thursday. While delivering a speech on inflation dynamics at the university's Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture, Yellen noted that the inflation shortfall is likely to be transitory, as one-off factors such as lower energy prices and weaker imports due to a stronger dollar abate. Yellen added that inflation should reach the Fed's 2% target when the labor market returns to full employment.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said its Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index  increased by $54.9 million or 0.4% in August, or at the same rate as its increase a month earlier. Personal income rose by 0.3% last month, following an upward revision of 0.1% in July to 0.4%.
The Core PCE Index, which strips out food and energy prices, increased 0.4% on a month-over-month basis, on the back of strong gains in durable goods and motor vehicles and parts. It follows an increase of 0.3% in July.
On a yearly basis, Core PCE inched up 0.1% from its July level to 1.3% over the last 12 months. The Core or Real PCE Index is the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, as it decides whether to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed's targeted goal of 2% in every month for the last three years.
A rate hike is widely viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in search of higher yields.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year plunged more than seven basis points to 2.093%, while yields on the U.S. 30-Year fell more than eight basis points to 2.875%, as a pullback in risky assets sent investors scurrying to safe-haven government bonds. Treasury yields are inversely related to bond prices.
Investors await the release of September inflation data in the euro zone on Wednesday for further indications on the strength of the global economy. Analysts expect to see a 0.1% gain for the month, following a 0.1% increase in August.

The currency pair wavered between a range of 1.1117 and 1.1296, before settling at 1.1195, down 0.0037 or 0.33% on the session. The euro has now closed lower against the American dollar in five of the last seven sessions. For the week, the euro lost nearly 1% in value against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1088, the low from September 4 and was met with resistance at 1.1625, the high from Aug. 25.
Speaking at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst on Thursday evening, Yellen said conditions in the economy will likely be appropriate for the Fed to raise the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at some point in 2015. It marked the first time Yellen personally supported a 2015 rate hike since July. Yellen's stance represents a stark contrast from her position last week when the Federal Open Market Committee only disclosed that 13 of 17 of its members were in favor of raising rates this year.
The Federal Funds Rate, the rate at which banks use to lend to other institutions on overnight loans, has remained at its current ""zero-bound level,"" since December, 2008. Nearly a decade has passed since the FOMC last hiked short-term interest rates.
Yellen also noted that the inflation shortfall is likely to be transitory, as one-off factors such as lower energy prices and weaker imports due to a stronger dollar abate. Yellen added that inflation should reach the Fed's 2% target when the labor market returns to full employment. Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed's goal for every month over the last three years.
The FOMC is expected to take a ""data-driven approach,"" in determining whether it should wait until October or December for lift-off. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Commerce said the nation's Real Gross Domestic Product for the second quarter increased by 3.9% on an annual basis, above consensus estimates of a 3.7% gain. Real GDP measures the value of the goods and services produced by the nation's economy less the value of the goods and services used in production adjusted for inflation. The acceleration in Real GDP over the quarter reflects an uptick in export levels, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in a statement.
Separately, the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center said its consumer sentiment index ticked up to 87.2 for September, up from a preliminary reading of 85.7. Analysts expected a final reading of 87.1 for the month.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.4% on Friday to an intraday high of 96.88. The index surged to its highest level since mid-August, before closing at 96.37, up 0.26% on the day.

In prepared remarks for a speech at the University of Massachussetts-Amherst, Yellen emphasized that most of her colleagues will likely support raising the target range for the Federal Funds Rate at some point this year. Yellen's stance represents a stark contrast from her position last week when the FOMC only disclosed that 13 of 17 of its members were in favor of raising rates this year. Yellen had not personally associated herself with a rate hike since July.
Following the FOMC's July meeting, China rattled global markets by devaluing the yuan in an effort to stimulate its flagging economy. Earlier this week, a preliminary reading of China's factory activity in September slumped to its lowest level in more than six years.

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1165 and a high of 1.1296 before settling at 1.1181, down 0.0052 or 0.46% on the day. The euro has now fallen against the dollar in five of the last six sessions. Over the last month of trading, the euro is down by more than 1.6% against its American counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from September 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1442, the high from Sept. 17.
In prepared remarks for a speech at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Yellen emphasized that most of her colleagues will likely support raising the target range for the Federal Funds Rate at some point this year. Yellen's stance represents a stark contrast from her position last week when the FOMC only disclosed that 13 of 17 of its members were in favor of raising rates this year. Yellen had not personally associated herself with a rate hike since July. 
Citing the negative effects of global economic weakness on U.S. inflation, the FOMC voted last Thursday to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between zero and 0.25%. The Federal Funds Rate, the rate at which banks use to lend to other institutions on overnight loans, has remained at its current ""zero-bound level,"" since December, 2008.
At the same time, the Fed downgraded its median inflation forecasts at the meeting to 0.3% for the end of 2015, while lowering inflation expectations for the end of next year to 1.7%. The Fed now expects that inflation will not reach its targeted goal of 2% until 2018. Long-term inflation has remained under the Fed's goal for every month over the last three years.
On Thursday, however, Yellen noted that the inflation shortfall is likely to be transitory, as one-off factors such as lower energy prices and weaker imports due to a stronger dollar abate. Yellen added that inflation should reach the Fed's 2% target when the labor market returns to full employment.
Since the closely-watched decision, a host of Fed governors have adopted a relatively hawkish stance, providing signals that the U.S. central bank could be on the verge of policy normalization. Over the weekend, San Francisco Fed president John Williams emphasized that the FOMC's decision to leave rates unchanged for a 55th consecutive meeting was a ""close call,"" dropping hints that the Fed could raise rates before the end of the year. Addressing a conference on the U.S.-China financial system, Williams said the U.S. labor market could reach full employment in the ""near future,"" even though inflation still remains far below the Fed's expectations.
Shortly thereafter, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, a non-voting member, told CNBC that he would have dissented if he had a vote last week, citing ample accommodation in the system to offset potential deflation. While supporting the FOMC's decision last week, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart, meanwhile, did not rule out a rate hike by the end of the year.
Yellen added that it is prudent to tighten monetary in a ""timely fashion,"" and that interest rates should be boosted at a ""gradual pace,"" after the initial hike. The first hike, Yellen said, only has minor implications on the markets, paling in comparison to the ""trajectory of rate increases,"" on a long-term basis.
The comments came one day after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said he was unsure on whether it will extend the length of its comprehensive asset-purchasing program due to continuing uncertainty in the global economy."

USD/BRL hit highs of 4.2477, the most since the currency was introduced in 1994 and was last at 4.2117. The real has lost almost 48% of its value against the dollar to date this year.
Brazil’s economy has been hit hard by the global rout in commodities prices and the economic slowdown in China. China is Brazil’s largest trading partner.
Lower commodity prices have contributed to a sharp widening of Brazil’s budget deficit, prompting the government to resort to austerity measures to plug the gap.
A wide ranging corruption scandal at state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), involving many prominent politicians, have complicated efforts by President Dilma Rousseff to cut government spending and shore up the country’s finances.
Earlier this month Brazil’s rating was downgraded to junk by Standard & Poor’s amid concerns over the growing deficit, and investors expect Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service to soon follow suit.
The real has also been pressured lower by expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon start to tighten monetary policy.
The drop in the real came despite efforts on Wednesday by the country’s central bank to prop up the currency.

423,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 24, 2015 08:17AM ET</span>",Krone Tumbles To 13-Year Low On Norway Rate Cut,"By Avaneesh Pandey -

Norway’s central bank unexpectedly cut its key interest rate Thursday to an all-time low, sending the Norwegian krone tumbling. After the Oslo-based Norges Bank slashed its deposit rate by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent -- citing a fall in investments triggered by a steady decline in oil prices -- the country’s currency fell to its weakest level in more than 13 years against the dollar, Bloomberg reported.
Following the rate cut, the krone slid more than 2 percent to 8.46 per dollar, and 2.3 percent against the euro.
“Growth prospects for the Norwegian economy have weakened, and inflation is projected to abate further out,” central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen said in a statement announcing the rate cut, adding that lower demand for goods and services from the energy sector would hit other parts of the economy and increase unemployment.
However, a weaker krone would push inflation -- which stood at 2.9 percent in August -- even higher in the short term.
“They [the central bank] cut the rate and are now saying that most likely there will be another cut before Christmas and most likely another cut in 2016,” Frank Jullum, chief economist at Danske Bank Markets, told the New York Times. “This was even more negative compared to what we had expected.”
Almost half of Norway’s exports are related to petroleum. As a result, the recent plunge in crude prices has hit the country hard.
In the second quarter, Norway’s exports fell 0.1 percent, while petroleum and shipping industry output declined 1 percent. Norway’s GDP also rose only 0.2 percent in the second quarter, falling slightly from a 0.3 percent rise in the previous quarter.

The currency pair traded in a range between 1.1105 and 1.1213, before settling at 1.1180, up 0.0052 or 0.47% on the session. After falling to its lowest level since early-September, the euro pared earlier losses against the dollar to end a four-session losing skid. Over the last month of trading, the euro is still down by more than 1.75% against its American counterpart. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1088, the low from Sept. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1625, the high from Aug. 25. 
Speaking in Brussels before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Draghi indicated that a slowdown in the Chinese economy and crashing oil prices have made it difficult to forecast the long-term path of inflation throughout the euro zone. Draghi, the president of the ECB, was widely expected on Wednesday to expand the bank's EUR 60 billion a month quantitative easing program beyond next September. 
""The asset purchase program has sufficient in-built flexibility,"" Draghi said. ""We will adjust its size, composition and duration as appropriate, if more monetary policy impulse should become necessary.""
Also on Wednesday, Markit's euro zone composite PMI index, which factors both manufacturing activity and services, slid to 53.9 in September, down 0.4 from its reading a month earlier. 
It came hours after the release of the Flash China Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Index, a preliminary gauge of Chinese factory activity. For the month of September, the index fell to 47.0, marking its lowest level in 78 months. New orders dipped by 0.6 to 46.0, while new export orders plummeted 0.8 to 45.8. Analysts expected the index to tick up slightly to 47.5 from a final reading of 47.3 in August. The regression in manufacturing activity in September represents the seventh straight month of monthly declines. 
Any reading below 50 provides signals of imminent contraction. 
Last week, Fed chair Janet Yellen noted that heightened concerns about growth in China and a number of emerging markets have contributed to increased volatility in the global economy.

439,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 22, 2015 05:45PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls for 4th straight day ahead of Draghi, Yellen appearances","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Tuesday posting its fourth straight losing session, ahead of appearances by Mario Draghi and Janet Yellen later this week, which could provide further indications of a divergence in monetary policy between two of the world's largest central banks. 
The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1114 and a high of 1.1207 before settling at 1.1132, down 0.0058 or 0.51% on the session. Following an eight-session winning streak earlier this month, EUR/USD has now closed lower in six of the last eight sessions. More broadly, the euro has lost about 2% in value against its American counterpart over the last month of trading. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from September 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24. 
Investors await a highly-anticipated appearance by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on Wednesday before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affair for hints on whether the ECB could extend its comprehensive EUR 1.1 trillion quantitative easing program. It will come days after ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet suggested that persistent weaknesses in the global economy could prompt the central bank to introduce further stimulus measures to boost economic activity throughout the euro zone. Yellen, meanwhile, will make her first public appearance since the Fed opted to hold short-term interest rates at its current near-zero level last week, when she delivers a speech at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
A host of Fed governors continue to reiterate that a 2015 rate hike is on the table in the wake of last week's policy action. The U.S. central bank has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at record lows since December, 2008 in an effort to stimulate a dormant economy reeling from the Financial Crisis. Nearly a decade has passed since the FOMC last tightened its monetary policy by instituting a rate hike. 
Over the weekend, though, San Francisco Fed president John Williams acknowledged that the Fed's decision on whether to normalize policy was a ""tough one,"" while providing indications that its next step could be to raise rates gradually if inflation moves upward in the coming weeks. At the FOMC's September policy meeting, 13 of its 17 members predicted that the committee will raise short-term rate by at least 0.25% at some point this year. 
Then, on Monday, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart told reporters that he saw ""few significant risks,"" in waiting to raise rates, while adding that a rate hike before New Year's is still possible. It came hours after St. Louis Fed president James Bullard strongly opposed a dovish stance toward a delayed hike, telling CNBC that he would have dissented from last week's decision if he had a vote. 
Elsewhere, the euro area's Consumer Confidence Flash Index decreased 0.2 to -7.1 in September, significantly below consensus estimates of a -7.0 reading. Consumer confidence waned during the month, amid widespread concerns related to a slowing global economy and the European refugee crisis. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.6% to an intraday high of 96.58, its highest level in nearly two weeks.

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1181 and a high of 1.1330, before settling at 1.1189, down 0.0110 or 0.97% on the session. The euro has now fallen on three consecutive sessions against the dollar since surging more than 1.3% last Thursday when the Federal Reserve opted to hold short-term interest rates at their current near-zero level for the 55th consecutive meeting.

At 1.7% the current rate fell back to its level from the first four months of the year and approached near multi-year lows. Last week, the FOMC downgraded its median inflation forecasts at its September monetary policy meeting to 0.3% for the end of 2015, while lowering inflation expectations for the end of next year to 1.7%. The Federal Reserve now expects that inflation will not reach its 2.0% target until 2018.

Addressing a conference on the U.S.-China financial system, Williams said the U.S. labor market could reach full employment in the ""near future,"" even though inflation still remains far below the Fed's expectations.
""Given the progress we've made and continue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates,"" Williams said.
Other members of the FOMC appear considerably more hawkish. James Bullard, a non-voting member of the committee, told CNBC that he would have dissented if he had a vote last week, citing ample accommodation in the system to offset potential deflation.
""I understand that there are risks out there but you have to take a prudent policy and inch your way back to normal,"" Bullard said.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged roughly 1% to an intraday high of 96.14, its highest level in more than a week., before settling at 96.06. The index has closed higher in each of the last three sessions.

453,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 21, 2015 08:30AM ET</span>",South Africa's Rand Recoils From 3-Week High,"By Morgan Winsor -

South Africa’s rand dipped Monday from its highest levels in three weeks, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to delay raising interest rates. The South African currency recoiled from Friday’s gains after a top Fed policymaker said a rate hike this year is still likely, Reuters reported.
The commodity-linked rand was 0.27 percent weaker at 13.3515 to the U.S. dollar compared with Friday’s New York close of 13.350. South African government bonds echoed the rand as yields in the U.S. climbed, with the heavily-traded paper due in 2026 adding 3.5 basis points to 8.370 percent. Stocks also opened 328 points lower, with South Africa’s blue-chip Top-40 index shedding 0.72 percent Monday morning.
The world’s most influential bank last week decided to keep U.S. interest rates steady for now, but the prospect of a rate hike lingered and repelled investors from riskier assets as an economic slowdown in China fuels a slump in global commodity prices. A rate hike by the Federal Reserve would likely lead to a stronger U.S. dollar, which could threaten emerging markets such as South Africa. South Africa’s central bank has raised the benchmark interest rate twice since July last year and the rand, which is linked to the value of the country’s commodities, has softened 12 percent against the dollar this year, Bloomberg reported.

A U.S. interest rate hike is likely this year because the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to leave rates near zero “was a close call,” John Williams, a centrist and president of the San Francisco Fed, said Saturday.
""Given the progress we've made and continue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates, most likely starting sometime later this year,"" Williams reportedly said at a weekend conference on the China-U.S. financial system, according to Reuters.
Lower import demand in China has dealt a blow to countries such as South Africa, where producers of gold, wine and other goods depend on their Chinese trading partners. International confidence in China, the world’s second-largest economy, has weighed on emerging markets since Beijing suffered its worst single-day market losses in August since 2007.
Dwindling consumer confidence could also bring Africa’s second-largest economy to a crushing halt as South Africa grapples with lower Chinese imports, slumping commodity prices and sluggish economic growth. A recent report by the South African Institute of Race Relations found that growing financial pressure on South African consumers could further depress the country’s bleak economic outlook."

464,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2015 06:05PM ET</span>","EUR/USD pares most of Thursday's gains, amid fallout from Fed decision","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell considerably on Friday as the dollar erased nearly all of its losses from the previous session when it was pushed lower by a widely expected decision by the Federal Reserve to hold short-term interest rates at their current near-zero levels.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1270 and 1.1460 before settling at 1.1299, down 0.0136 or 1.19% on the session. Following Friday's losses, the pair ended the week relatively flat down by roughly 0.35% over the past few days. The euro is still up by more than 2% in value versus the dollar over the last month of trading.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1088, the low from September 4 and was met with resistance at 1.1625, the high from Aug. 25.
Investors continued to react to a relatively dovish statement from the Federal Open Market Committee on Thursday, which voted to leave its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged, after citing broad weakness in the global economy. In the September monetary policy statement, the FOMC reiterated that it would like to see improvements in the labor market and signals that inflation is moving toward its long-term targeted goal of 2% inflation before it raises rates for the first time since 2006. Still, 13 of the 17 members present at the meeting predicted that the FOMC will raise the Fed Funds Rate by at least 0.25% by the end of the year.
The Fed Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since the height of the Financial Crisis.
Despite expressing significant concerns with the pace of economic growth globally, Fed chair Janet Yellen appeared more optimistic with the developments of the U.S. economy since the FOMC last met in July. The U.S. labor market, she said, is moving closer to full employment, which creates upward pressure on inflation.
The Fed is expected to keep a close eye on the September national employment report for indications of continued wage growth. While non-farm average hourly earnings ticked up by 0.3% in August from the previous month, they were up only 2.2% from their level in August, 2014. On an inflation-adjusted basis, wage gains have remained virtually flat over the last five years. Over the second quarter, U.S. labor costs inched up 0.2%, recording their smallest increase in more than 30 years.
One day after falling by more than 10 basis points, yields on the U.S. 2-Year fell mildly by two basis points to 0.678%. The short-term Treasuries are sensitive to changes in the Fed Funds Rate.
Elsewhere, the dollar rose sharply against a host of emerging market currencies, including the Kazakh Tenge, Korean Won and Brazilian Real on Friday. Following the Fed's decision, the dollar depreciated against a number of currencies from smaller nations around the world. A rate hike is generally viewed as bearish for emerging markets.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.75% to an intraday high of 95.53, before falling back slightly to 95.36. For the week, the index inched up by 0.03%. "

The decision came as the Swiss government said Thursday it was expecting ""below-average"" economic growth this year and next year.

The disappointing data from last month was released ahead of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's highly-anticipated press conference on Thursday, where the Fed could announce plans to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time in more than nine years.

Analysts expected monthly CPI to remain unchanged from its July level. On a year-over-year basis, the Consumer Price Index increased by 0.2% following a 0.2% gain last month.
Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, also experienced muted gains. In August, Core CPI increased by 0.1% on a monthly basis, below analysts' expectations for a 0.2% gain. Over the last 12 months, the core reading  is up by 1.8% -- following a similar yearly increase in July. The reading falls slightly below the Fed's long-term targeted goal of 2% inflation. In July, the Core PCE Index, the Fed's preferred gauge for long-term inflation, stood at 1.2%.
Last month, Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer indicated that there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the temporary forces restraining it from a stronger dollar and falling energy prices continue to ""dissipate further.""

506,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 15, 2015 09:01AM ET</span>",China Currency Will Keep Falling Against Dollar: Economists,"By Lydia Tomkiw -

Economists have predicted that China’s currency, the yuan, would continue to slide against the U.S. dollar until the end of 2015, according to a survey conducted by CNN Money. Median estimates predicted a drop of 2.8 percent.
The yuan has already fallen by 2.6 percent since January, including a major two-day slump in August that resulted in global stocks being sold off and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling by more than 1,000 points before recovering.
A fall of 17.8 percent against the U.S. dollar was one of the most dramatic forecasts put forth by an economist. China’s central bank, which has adjusted how the yuan’s 2 percent trading range is set, now uses the currency’s closing price from the previous day.
The possible continued devaluation of the yuan has prompted fears of a regional impact across Asian markets. Countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong export in large quantities to China and any slowdown in China could lead to a regional impact.
“Further devaluation could trigger further capital outflow that weighs further on the economy,” said Jianguang Shen of Mizuho Securities, speaking with CNNMoney.
The Shanghai Composite also dropped 6.1 percent this week, with China’s energy producer, PetroChina Co., falling to a low, according to Bloomberg.
“The most worrying aspect for the market is that we have had a lot of incremental monetary policy stimulus over the past twelve months, but it has done little to drive faster growth,” said Nathan Griffiths, a senior emerging-market equities manager at NN Investment Partners, speaking with Bloomberg.
China’s Premier Li Keqiang tried to reassure investors last week while speaking to the World Economic Forum. ""China is not a source of risk for the world economy but a source of strength,” said Li. “The positive factors in the economy are building up.”
Reassurances hinge on “whether China continues to pull back on importing global wares -- not least, commodities -- as the world's second-largest economy continues to slow its pace of growth after three decades of breakneck development,” International Business Times has reported."

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1284 and a high of 1.1373 before settling at 1.1316, down 0.0022 or 0.19% on the session. Last week, the euro surged to two-week highs against the dollar, amid a wave of mixed U.S. economic data, which provided further confusion on whether the Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate on Thursday. The euro still closed above 1.13 against its American counterpart on Monday for the third consecutive session.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.10125, the low from August 15 and was met with resistance at 1.1625, the high from Aug. 25. Over the last month of trading, the pair has risen in value by more than 1.5%.
Currency traders are hesitant to make any major trades before the FOMC issues a closely watched statement on Thursday at 2 p.m. EST, upon the completion of its September monetary policy meeting. Nearly a decade has passed since the U.S. Central Bank has raised its benchmark Federal Funds Rate. The rate, which banks use to lend to other institutions on overnight loans, has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since December, 2008.
In recent months, Fed chair Janet Yellen has indicated that the FOMC will take a ""data-driven approach,"" to policy normalization, placing a strong emphasis on the strength of the economy and labor markets, as it weighs the decision. In August, U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 173,000, below consensus estimates of a 223,000 gain. The unemployment rate, however, fell to 5.1%, its lowest level since April, 2008, prior to the start of the Financial Crisis.
The Fed also reportedly remains concerned that weakness in the Chinese economy could have a spillover effect onto the global markets at large, possibly forcing it to keep the Fed Funds Rate at its current zero-bound level. Over the weekend, the Chinese government released disappointing data, illustrating that factory production and fixed-asset investment last month were both weaker than expected. The latest data provide further indications that the world's second-largest economy might fail to meet its annual growth target expectation of 7% for 2015.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries on Monday fell more than eight basis points to 2.183%. At one point, bond yields dipped to 2.164%, its lowest level over the last six sessions.

The Financial Futures Association of Japan (FFAJ) has published its most recent data on OTC (over-the counter) retail foreign exchange (FX) margin trading volumes for the month of August 2015.
After six consecutive months of strong growth leading up to January 2015, Japan saw FX trading volumes dive in early 2015. Since then, volumes have not rebounded to their January highs.
However, August 2015 saw a modest 2.5% MoM increase from the previous month of July, with the trading volume of OTC FX margin trading coming in at 491 trillion yen.
Volatility was relatively high throughout the month, especially the latter half. FFAJ particularly highlighted a sharp fall in the South Africa Rand that occurred in the early morning of August 24, while theyen rallied against the USD.

Open positions at the end of the month declined by 653.9 billion JPY from the previous month, with a total of 6,661 billion JPY in open positions.
At the end of August, 55 FX margin trading operators were reported to be active in the country. While the Japanese retail FX market is large by any standard, margins are much thinner vis-à-vis its Western competitors. Indeed, domestic competition between brokers is fierce and regulation is strict.

526,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2015 05:57PM ET</span>","EUR/USD posts seventh straight win, ahead of critical Fed Sept. meeting","Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged to its highest level for the month of September on Friday, as currency traders gear up for the possibility of divergent monetary policies on each side of the Atlantic as early as next week if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates at Thursday's FOMC meeting.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1255 and 1.1350, before settling at 1.1338, up 0.0058 or 0.51%. The euro has now closed higher against its American counterpart for seven consecutive sessions, to enjoy one of its longest winning streaks of the year. EUR/USD ended Friday's session at its highest closing level since August 25.
EUR/USD gained support at 1.1088, the low from Sept. 4 and was met with resistance at 1.1562 the high from Aug. 26.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said its headline Producer Price Index for August remained unchanged in August, following a 0.2% gain a month earlier. The reading came in substantially higher than low end of consensus estimates of a 0.6% decline.
Meanwhile, the Core PPI-FD, which strips out food and energy prices, ticked up by 0.3%, marking the third consecutive month of considerable gains. On a yearly basis, the core reading has increased by 0.9%, providing support to hawkish views for an imminent rate hike.
While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would like to see long-term inflation reach its targeted goal of 2% before it lifts its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade, vice chair Stanley Fischer has indicated that the U.S. central bank could normalize policy before it reaches the threshold. Long-term inflation has remained under 2% in every month for the last three years.
Next week, the Labor Department will release the Consumer Price Index for August on Wednesday, which coincides with the start of the FOMC's two-day September meeting. The Fed's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current level of zero to 0.25% since December, 2008. When the economy is growing at a high rate, the U.S. typically increases the Fed Funds Rate to encourage people to save more and spend less. As a result, the action is meant to slow the economy and reduce inflationary pressures.
On Thursday, Bank of Finland governor Erkki Liikanen, a member of the European Central Bank Governing Council, said the ECB was committed to continue making asset purchases as part of its €60 billion a month quantitative easing program until the end of September, 2016.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1132 and 1.1295 before settling at 1.1279, up 0.0072 or 0.64% on the session. The euro ended the day at its highest closing level against the dollar in more than a week. EUR/USD has gained nearly 3% in value over the last month of trading. While the euro's daily gains versus its American counterpart during the recent streak have been modest, Thursday's move marked the pair's sharpest appreciation over the period.

On Thursday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said U.S. import prices fell by 1.9% last month, extending previous losses of 0.9% in July. On a year-over-year basis, imported inflation has fallen by 11.4% -- its lowest amount since September, 2009. Export prices, meanwhile, declined 1.4% far below expectations for a 0.4% drop. Exports prices fell by 7% over the last 12 months, also its lowest level since 2009.
The FOMC is keeping a close eye on temporary headwinds restraining inflation as it decides whether to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at next week's two-day meeting, which concludes on Thursday. Nearly a decade has passed since the FOMC has lifted the rate, which banks use to lend to other institutions on overnight loans. The Fed Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since December, 2008.
Many investors worry that an imminent rate hike will place undue downward pressure on long-term inflation, which has remained under the Fed's targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. In June, the Fed's Survey of Economic Projections forecasted that Core PCE inflation will rise to a level between 1.6 and 1.9% in 2016 from its current level of 1.2%. By the end of 2017, analysts expect core inflation to reach between 1.9 and 2.0%, according to the survey.
Last month at a symposium in Wyoming, however, Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer emphasized that the Fed should not wait until inflation moves back up to 2% to begin raising short-term rates. In addition, Fischer told CNBC that recent economic data had been impressive, providing a compelling argument for short-term rates to head in a higher direction.
Earlier this week, World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu warned that a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee next week could trigger a widespread crisis in emerging markets, pushing capital away from their economies and potentially creating sharp fluctuations in their currencies. Officials from the International Monetary Fund have issued similar warnings in recent weeks on the severe ramifications a rate hike could have on global markets that are not in the position to absorb a tightening of monetary policy from the U.S. central bank.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries gained two basis points to 2.22%, while yields on the German 10-Year Bunds were unchanged at 0.69%. The spread between the government bond yields widened to 153 basis points, the highest level in three weeks.

The currency pair traded between 1.1132 and 1.1217 during Wednesday's session, before settling at 1.1207, up 0.0004 or 0.03%. After falling below 1.10 on August 10, the euro is now up 2.2% against the dollar over the last month of trading. Although the euro has closed higher against its American counterpart in each of the last five trading sessions, the gains have been modest. During the span, its strongest move came on Tuesday when it rose by only 0.30%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086, the low from Sept. 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1562, the high from Aug. 26.
The U.S. Labor Department said on Wednesday in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) that nationwide openings increased to a new series high in July, reaching a level of 5.8 million. The survey previously rose to a series-high in May when it reached a level of 5.4 million. The robust increase in job openings in July helped push the total to its highest reading in the 15-year history of the survey.
The job openings rate surged 3.9% in July, after measuring at 3.6% the previous three months. It also came off the back of a mixed employment report for August on Friday when the labor market added 173,000 non-farm payrolls, while the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, its lowest level since April, 2008.
On Tuesday, World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu warned that a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee next week could trigger a widespread crisis in emerging markets, pushing capital away from their economies and potentially creating sharp fluctuations in their currencies. Officials from the International Monetary Fund have issued similar warnings in recent weeks on the severe ramifications a rate hike could have on global markets that are not in the position to absorb a tightening of monetary policy from the U.S. central bank.
Nearly a decade has passed since the FOMC has lifted its benchmark Federal Funds Rate, the rate in which banks lend to other institutions on overnight loans. The Fed Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since December, 2008.
Elsewhere, the Bank of Canada kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5%, following two rate cuts earlier this year – most recently in July. USD/CAD rose 0.36% to 1.3255. In Japan, the Nikkei surged 7.7%, its largest gain in seven years, after prime minister Shinzo Abe pledged to cut corporate taxes by 3.3% by next year. USD/JPY gained 0.58% to close at 120.50, its highest closing level in more than a week."

USD/CAD slid 0.33% to 1.3164 from around 1.3249 ahead of the announcement.
The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 0.5%, in line with expectations.
The simulative effects of previous monetary policy actions are working their way through the Canadian economy, the bank said.
The BoC already cut interest rates twice earlier this year, in response to the recessionary effects of low oil prices.
In its monetary policy statement the central bank said inflation remained close to the bottom of the target range, reflecting price declines in consumer energy products.
Movements in the Canadian dollar were helping to absorb some of the impact of lower commodity prices the bank said.
While the overall export picture is still uncertain, the latest data confirms that exchange rate-sensitive exports are regaining momentum, it added.
Earlier this month official figures showed that Canada’s economy expanded 0.5% in June, but contracted by an annualized 0.5% in the April-to-June period after contracting 0.8% in the first three months of the year.
Two consecutive quarters without growth means that the economy has entered a technical recession.

EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1086 the low from September 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1333, the high from Sept. 1.
Speaking exclusively to the Financial Times, World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu indicated that a rate hike by the Fed next week could trigger a widespread crisis in emerging markets, pushing capital away from their economies and potentially creating sharp fluctuations in their currencies. It came after officials from the International Monetary Fund issues similar warnings on the severe ramifications that could result from a rate hike by the Fed. In June, the World Bank hinted that it may need to revise its growth projection of 2.8% for the global economy for 2015 due to mounting worries of slowing growth in both Brazil and China.
Elsewhere in China, its dollar-denominated exports fell sharply by 5.5% on a year-over-year basis in August, exacerbating concerns about persisting weakness in the world's second-largest economy. Imports, meanwhile, tumbled 13.8% on a yearly basis, producing a trade surplus of $60.24 billion. The Shanghai Composite index still rallied by more than 4.5% in the final hour of trading to erase losses from Monday's session and close up by approximately 3%. 
On Monday, the index closed down by more than 2.5% as news reverberated that China revised its GDP growth rate for 2015 downward from 7.4% to 7.3%. Many economists expect Chinese GDP growth to fall below 7% for the third quarter after barely reaching the threshold over the first two quarters of the year. China is currently experiencing its lowest rate of economic growth in more than a decade. 
For the most part, currency traders are reluctant to execute any major trades before the Federal Open Market Committee completes its two-day September meeting on Sept. 17. Analysts believe there is a 50-50 chance the FOMC could raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time since 2006. 
At a panel discussion late last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer indicated there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the temporary forces restraining it continue to ""dissipate further."" Core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge of price increases, has still remained under its long-term targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. The core reading of PCE inflation strips out the heavy impact of food and energy prices.

Thomson Reuters has just announced the company’s latest foreign exchange (forex) trading figures for the month of August 2015. The trading volumes across the company’s Matching and FXall trading platforms have seen an uptick, rising on both a monthly and an annual basis.
Although the figures are not stratospheric, the rising volumes are good news for the company, which has seen a couple of disappointing months in terms of declining volumes, with both May and July well below par.
Getting into the numbers, Thomson Reuters reported that the total average daily volume (ADV) of forex trading across its platforms in August totalled $364 billion. This represents a 2.5% increase from the same month in 2014 and a 3% jump from July 2015.

Of that total volume, the figure can be broken down into spot trading and other, which includes forwards, swaps, options and non-deliverable forwards (NDFs). The average daily volume for spot trading in August came in at $119 billion, a healthy 16.4% up from the previous month and a 10.6% increase YoY.

The figures will encourage the company, which faces stiffening competition. Just last month, the company announced additional forex trading capabilities for corporate treasurers on its flagship desktop offering, Eikon. The move came only days after Eikon’s rival, ICAP’s EBS BrokerTec, revealed that it was implementing a similar offering.

567,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2015 04:07AM ET</span>",Gold futures struggle for direction amid U.S. rate hike uncertainty,"Investing.com - Gold futures struggled for direction on Monday, amid ongoing uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates later this month.
Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 20 cents, or 0.02%, to trade at $1,121.60 a troy ounce during European morning hours. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday.
On Friday, gold dropped $3.10, or 0.28%, after mixed U.S. payrolls data failed to quell uncertainty over the prospect of a near-term interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 173,000 jobs last month, below forecasts for an increase of 220,000 and slowing from gains of 245,000 a month earlier.
However, the unemployment rate dropped from 5.3% to 5.1%, better than expectations for 5.2% and the lowest since April 2008.
Hourly earnings, a component of the jobs report that the Federal Reserve has said must rise, ticked up 0.3%, above forecasts for a 0.2% increase and following a gain of 0.2% in the previous month.
The jobs report failed to provide much clarity on when the Federal Reserve will decide to raise short term interest rates. The timing of a Fed rate hike has been a constant source of debate in the markets in recent months.
Prices of the precious metal dropped $10.50, or 1.1%, last week, the second straight weekly loss. Gold fell to a five-and-a-half year low of $1,072.30 on July 24 amid speculation the Fed will raise interest rates in September for the first time since 2006.
Expectations of higher borrowing rates going forward is considered bearish for gold, as the precious metal struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when rates are on the rise.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied 4.4 cents, or 1.92%, to trade at $2.356 a pound.
Copper's gains came as a sharp rebound in European equity markets helped soothe investors' tattered nerves.
Most Asian markets ended lower on Monday, as investors monitored wild swings in China's equity markets.
The Shanghai Composite, which reopened after a four-day extended weekend, took investors on a roller coaster ride, rising almost 2% after the open, only to turn negative after the midday break to end down 2.5%.
The red metal sank to a six-year low of $2.202 on August 24 as concerns over the health of China's economy and steep declines on Chinese stock markets dampened appetite for the red metal.
The Asian nation is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for almost 40% of world consumption last year.

The currency pair traded in a range between 1.1091 and 1.1188 before settling at 1.1151, up 0.0028 or 0.25% on Friday's session. For the week, the euro fell by approximately 0.5% against the dollar after suffering sharp declines in each of the previous two sessions. Despite fluctuating between 1.08 and 1.18 over the last four months, EUR/USD is virtually flat in comparison with its level in early-May.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0959, the low from August 11 and was met with resistance at 1.1625, the high from Aug. 25.
On Friday morning the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said nonfarm payrolls for the month of August increased by 173,000, below estimates of a 223,000 gain. The figure received a boost from a 56,000 gain in Health Care and social assistance jobs, including an increase of 16,000 in hospital positions. For the month, employment in financial activities rose by 19,000 and has expanded by 170,000 over the last year. Following upward revisions of 44,000 for June and July, monthly job gains have averaged 221,000 over the last three months.
Many economists regard the August jobs report as a tricky one to analyze due to the high percentage of Americans who are away on vacation throughout the month.
The unemployment rate in August fell 0.2% to 5.1%, its lowest level since April, 2008. The rate was expected to fall by 0.1% to 5.2% according to consensus estimates after remaining unchanged in July.
The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader gauge of the national employment situation, inched down 0.1% to 10.3% on the month. The reading measures the total level of unemployed workers plus those marginally attached to the labor force, as well as those who are no longer looking for a job but have looked for one over the last 12 months. In addition, 1.8 million were classified as being marginally attached to the labor force, down from 2.1 million 12 months earlier. Last August, the U-6 rate stood at 12.0%, after falling by 0.6% from the previous month.
By comparison, the U-6 rate peaked above 17% during the height of the financial crisis. It is also a preferred measure of Fed chair Janet Yellen, as she weighs whether the labor market has improved enough to warrant an imminent rate hike.
Currency traders continued to digest a dovish policy meeting from the European Central Bank's Governing Council on Thursday when ECB head Mario Draghi provided strong indications that the central bank will use all tools necessary to boost inflation throughout the zone. Draghi hinted the ECB could extend its €60 billion a month Quantitative Easing program in an effort to bolster long-term GDP and inflation. The ECB also left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5%.
Investors piled into U.S. Treasury bonds on Friday, following the release of the mixed jobs report. Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries fell more than four basis points to 2.109%, its lowest level in more than a week, before closing at 2.131%."

The euro fell sharply against the dollar in European afternoon trading, after the ECB held interest rates at 0.05%, while downgrading its GDP and inflation forecasts over the next two years. The ECB also kept its marginal lending rate at 0.30% and left its facility rate unchanged at 0.20%.
Citing higher downside risks due to lower energy and commodity prices, ECB head Mario Draghi lowered the central bank's inflation projections for the remainder of 2015 to 0.1% from a previous estimate of 0.3%. The ECB has also lowered inflation projections for 2016 and 2017 from 1.5% and 1.8% to 1.1 and 1.7% respectively, Draghi added. At the same time, the ECB reduced GDP projections over the period predicting that it will remain below 2% through the end of 2017.
Draghi noted that the new forecasts were drawn up on Aug. 12, before China rattled global markets early last week with a wave of pessimistic economic indicators. The comments provided compelling indications that the ECB could ramp up its €60 billion a month Quantitative Easing program, which it launched earlier this spring. Previously, the ECB intended to continue the bond-buying program through September, 2016. On Thursday, Draghi indicated that the ECB could add stimulus measures and extend the duration of the program as a mechanism for bolstering inflation.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Department of Labor said that the number of individuals filing for initial job benefits increased by 12,000 last week to 282,000.

EUR/USD was down 0.86% to 1.1127 from around 1.1231 earlier.
The drop in the euro came after ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank’s asset purchase program provides sufficient flexibility to adjust the size, composition and duration of the program.
The ECB launched its €60 billion per month quantitative easing program in March after the euro area briefly slid into deflation and it is due to run until September 2016.
Draghi also said the share limit on the asset purchase program has been increased from 25% to 33%, meaning the ECB could buy more of a single asset.
The ECB lowered its forecast for growth and inflation, citing oil prices and slowing growth in China.
The bank now expects annual inflation of 0.1% in 2015, down from 0.3% previously, before picking up to 1.1% in 2016.

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1217 and a high of 1.1320 on Wednesday before settling at 1.226, down 0.0090 or 0.80% on the session. EUR/USD has fluctuated wildly in recent sessions, trading in between a range of 1.10 and 1.17 since August 17. Over the last month of trading, the euro is up by nearly 2.25% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1044, the low from Aug. 10 and was met with resistance at 1.713, the high from Aug. 24.
A number of currency traders appeared reluctant to make any major moves during Wednesday's session ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council on Thursday afternoon. Investors could be looking from signals from ECB head Mario Draghi on the viability of the bank's €60 billion a month quantitative easing program, which was launched in March. Previously, the ECB was on course to extend the bond-buying program through September, 2016 before a wave of economic shocks in China and soft commodity prices rattled global markets in recent weeks.
In August, inflation in the euro zone inched up by only 0.2% on a yearly basis, far below the ECB's targeted goal of 2%. During its last long-term estimate in June, the ECB forecasted inflation to reach 1.8% in 2017. If the ECB signals that it could continue the bond-buying initiative beyond next September, it might provide indications that it expects inflation to remain lower over the next several years.
In the U.S., analysts are bracing for a relatively weak U.S. jobs report for the month of August after forecasts from the ADP Research Institute fell sharply below consensus estimates on Wednesday. In its National Employment Report, ADP estimated that U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 190,000 in August, significantly under estimates of a 210,000 gain.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the August jobs report on Friday morning. In July, U.S. private payrolls increased by 215,000 as the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.3%. A soft reading on Friday could convince the Federal Reserve to delay a potential interest rate hike beyond September.
Meanwhile, former ECB head Jean Claude-Trichet defended the role of central banks throughout the world in soothing global markets. Speaking in an exclusive interview with CNBC, Trichet described major central banks such as the ECB and the Federal Reserve as ""anchors of stability,"" in helping stave off recessionary headwinds.

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.1208 and a high of 1.1332 before settling at 1.1314, up 0.0101 or 0.90% on the session. The euro closed above 1.13 against the dollar for the first time in five sessions. Before its current three-session winning streak, the euro had closed lower against the dollar in five of the prior six trading days. The euro is now up against its American counterpart by approximately 3% over the last month of trading.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0876, the low from August 4 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
In overnight trading, China's official manufacturing purchasing index (PMI) slumped to a three-year low in August, falling to 49.7 from a reading of 50 in July. Any reading below 50 typically provides an indication that the sector is on the verge of suffering a recession. Separately, Caixin's index of smaller factories in China plunged to a six-year low of 47.3 in August from 47.8 in July.
The world's second largest economy is on pace for its slowest expansion in nearly a decade, amid sharp decreases in exports and structural shifts in its productivity, capital and workforce. The reading rattled equity markets throughout the euro zone, as the U.K.'s FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC all fell by more than 2.3%.
The spillover also reached the U.S., as all three major indices lost more than 2.75% on Tuesday to extend last week's massive sell-off.
Also on Tuesday, Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, expressed significant concern with the steep transition the Chinese economy faces in the coming months in her first public comments since the People's Bank of China sparked a global sell-off early last week. Speaking in Jakarta, Lagarde cautioned investors on the spillover effects that could be created from persisting weakness in China's economy.
""As the Chinese economy is adjusting to a new growth model, growth is slowing—but not sharply, and not unexpectedly. The transition to a more market-based economy and the unwinding of risks built up in recent years is complex and could well be somewhat bumpy,"" Lagarde said.
Currency traders await a highly-anticipated meeting of the European Central Bank's governing council on Thursday for further indications on the long-term success of the ECB's ambitious quantitative easing program, which was launched in the winter.

616,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 01, 2015 08:30AM ET</span>",Nigerian Currency Plunges To The US Dollar,"By Morgan Winsor -

Nigeria’s currency plunged in value to the dollar Monday as the parallel market exchange rate rocketed amid an increased demand for the U.S. currency in the West African country, which is also grappling with a volatile currency from China’s economic slowdown. The naira devalued by N5 to N220 per dollar as Nigerians seek the U.S. currency to pay for school abroad and the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, according to Nigerian newspaper Vanguard.
“The demand is very high and the buyers willing to pick dollars at any available price. Also the demand of dollars by importers is increasing at an alarming rate,” Alhaji Aminu Gwadabe, president of the Association of Bureau De Change Operators of Nigeria, told Vanguard Tuesday.

The upcoming Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that they must fulfill at least once in their lifetime, has contributed to the soaring exchange rate in Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Managing director and chief executive of the H.J. Trust and Investment Bureau De Change in Nigeria’s city of Lagos said 66,000 people were approved for the annual pilgrimage. The Central Bank of Nigeria in the capital Abuja approved a maximum sale of $1,000 to each Hajj pilgrim at an exchange rate of N160 per U.S. dollar. But the Hajj, which is expected to start around Sept. 21, will cost about each pilgrim about $6,000, Vanguard reported.
As the school year commences, there was also an increased demand to pay for education fees abroad, which has compelled Nigerians to visit the parallel market to buy U.S. dollars or British pounds.
A downward trend in Chinese economic output has also struck Africa’s largest economy and top oil producer in recent weeks. Many sub-Saharan African currencies, including the Nigerian naira, are linked to the value of their oil and other commodity exports, which began to decline earlier this year when China missed its economic growth target. The naira has fallen around 15 percent over the last year, which has fueled inflation despite the central bank spending billions of dollars to bolster the Nigerian currency."

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1172 and 1.1262 before settling at 1.1215, up 0.0028 or 0.25% on the session. For the month of August, EUR/USD gained more than 2.5% in spite of a four-day losing streak last week when it fell below 1.12. The euro still remains down by more than 7% against the dollar on the calendar year.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0847, the low from Aug. 5 and was met with resistance at 1.1616, the high from Aug. 25.
On Monday, investors reacted to market-moving comments from European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and Fischer regarding global developments in inflation over the weekend. Appearing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's three-day Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming , Fischer indicated that there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the temporary forces restraining it continue to ""dissipate further."" Core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred gauge of price increases, has remained under its long-term targeted goal of 2% for every month over the last three years. The core reading of inflation strips out the heavy impact of food and energy prices.
During Fischer's address on U.S. Inflation Developments, the Fed vice chair blamed plunging energy prices, a stronger dollar and a soft commodities market for creating downward pressure on inflation. Fischer noted that a rise in the dollar by ""17% in nominal terms,"" over the last year could restrain U.S. GDP growth through next year and possibly into 2017. Fischer also described the crash in energy prices as a ""one-off"" event, even as U.S. crude futures hover near six and a half year lows. Fischer, however, added that energy markets do not expect crude prices to fall sharply in the near future and their influence holding down inflation should be viewed as transitory.
The Fed is also keeping a close eye on slack in the economy and labor market as it decides whether to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. A gradual reduction of slack is typically associated with less downward pressure on inflation. Labor market slack is defined as the quantity of unemployed resources such as labor and capital that can be implemented differently, but is not being utilized effectively. In June, the Fed's Survey of Economic Projections forecasted that Core PCE inflation will rise to a level between 1.6 and 1.9% in 2016 from its current level of 1.2%. By the end of 2017, analysts expect core inflation to reach between 1.9 and 2.0%, according to the survey.
In Wyoming, Fischer emphasized that the Fed should not wait until inflation moves back up to 2% to begin raising short-term rates. On Friday, Fischer indicated in an exclusive interview with CNBC that recent U.S. economic data had been impressive, providing a compelling argument for short-term rates to head in a higher direction.
The Bank of England is also mulling policy normalization in a move that is widely expected not to occur until at least 2016. In July, headline inflation in the euro zone increased moderately by 0.2%. The ECB Governing Council will meet next on Thursday.
“The prospect of sustained momentum (in the economy) will likely put the decision as to when to start the process of gradual monetary policy normalization into sharper relief around the turn of this year,"" Carney said.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2015 12:17AM ET</span>","China's yuan up on suspected intervention, set for August loss ","SHANGHAI， (Reuters) - China's yuan firmed on Monday after the central bank set a stronger guidance rate while it also appeared to continue using state-owned banks to support the Chinese currency, traders said.
For August, the currency is set to depreciate 2.7 percent if it closes at the midday level. Most of the losses came after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) surprised markets by devaluing the yuan by nearly 2 percent on Aug. 11.
""Major state-owned banks bought a large amount of yuan this morning,"" said a trader at an Asian bank in Shanghai. 
These banks were suspected of intervening on behalf of the central bank around 6.38 against the dollar, several traders said.
The PBOC set the midpoint rate  at 6.3893 per dollar prior to market open, 0.15 percent firmer than the previous fix 6.3986. 
The spot market  opened at 6.3890 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.3805 at midday, 0.13 percent stronger than the previous close.
After the abrupt devaluation on Aug. 11, Beijing appears to have been so surprised by the global reaction that it tends to keep the yuan on a tight leash to head off a currency war that could spark a broader financial crisis, policy insiders say.
Premier Li Keqiang reiterated at the weekend earlier remarks that there's no basis for continued depreciation of the yuan following its devaluation.
The yuan ""will stay basically stable as a reasonable and balanced level,"" he said. Most market watchers, however, believe there is political pressure for it to weaken further to support exports and reflecting expectations of further policy easing.
The offshore yuan  was trading 1.03 percent weaker than the onshore spot at 6.4469 per dollar by midday. 

Offshore one-year non-deliverable forwards contracts , considered the best available proxy for forward-looking market expectations of the yuan's value, traded at 6.6075, or 3.30 percent weaker than Monday's midpoint.

642,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2015 05:14PM ET</span>","EUR/USD moves lower, following Fischer's comments on possible rate hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD crashed below 1.12 on Friday capping a frenetic week of fluctuations, after market-moving comments from an influential member of the Federal Reserve on the increasing possibility of a September interest rate hike pushed the dollar broadly higher.
The currency pair wavered between 1.157 and 1.1310 on Friday before settling at 1.1187, up 0.0058 or 0.52% on the session. Over the last five days of trading, EUR/USD experienced one of its most volatile weeks of the year trading between a range of 1.11 and 1.17. After surging by more than 2% in Monday's session, the euro has fallen against the dollar in four consecutive sessions. For the week, EUR/USD closed lower by approximately 1.75%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1015, the low from August 18 and was met with resistance at 1.1713, the high from Aug. 24.
Speaking exclusively with CNBC, Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer indicated that recent U.S. economic data had been impressive providing a compelling argument for short-term rates to head in a higher direction. Without explicitly stating that the U.S. central bank will raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate next month, Fischer said the Fed could not wait for the case to be ""overwhelming"" before hiking rates above its current level of zero to 0.25%. Fischer also indicated that temporary headwinds that have caused recent volatility in global markets could recede quickly.
Currency traders await a panel discussion by several influential central bankers on Saturday, including Fischer at a conference in Jackson Hole for further indications on how global inflation could impact the Fed's decision on hiking short-term interest rates next month. The three-day summit at the mountaintop resort in Wyoming will conclude on Saturday with the most anticipated event of the conference – a symposium that will also feature Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan.
Fischer, a noted Dove, could provide some clarity on the Fed's relatively ambiguous interpretation of its short-term projections on inflationary growth. Last week's release of the July minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's last meeting painted a picture of a sharply divided Fed regarding their views on inflation. The FOMC said by some objectives the inflation data was ""not progressing"" toward its targeted goal, according to the minutes. Other members, however, said that inflation conditions for a rate hike would be met or could be ""met shortly.""
The Consumer Price Index for July inched up 0.1% on a month over month basis, below consensus estimates of a 0.2% increase. The Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, also rose modestly by 0.1%, falling below analysts' expectations. The yearly reading, which is a preferred gauge of inflation by the Fed, increased by 1.8%. In every month over the last three years, Core CPI on a year-over-year basis has fallen below the Fed's target of 2%.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.5% to an intraday high of 96.35, before falling back slightly to 96.15 in U.S. afternoon trading.

Following the Global Financial Crisis, OTC (over the counter) markets have been subject to greater oversight and tighter rules from regulators. Protection of individual, retail investors is one of the underlying motives.
Accordingly, an announcement today from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) seeks to further protect retail foreign exchange (forex) traders. The U.S. watchdog that oversees futures and option markets has approved rule amendments and a new interpretive notice filed by the National Futures Association (NFA).

The rule amendments and interpretive notice stipulate enhanced requirements for those forex dealers (referred to as FDMs) that are members of the NFA, an organization for the U.S. derivatives industry, including on-exchange traded futures, retail off-exchange foreign currency transactions, and swap transactions.
The rules include: imposing additional capital requirements on FDMs; requiring FDMs to collect security deposits for off-exchange foreign currency transactions from eligible contract participant counterparties in addition to retail counterparties; requiring FDMs to adopt and implement rigorous risk management programs; and requiring FDMs to provide additional market disclosures and firm-specific information on their websites to permit current and potential counterparties to better assess the risks of engaging in off-exchange foreign currency transactions and with conducting business with a particular FDM. Under the new rules, forex dealers will be required to maintain adjusted net capital equal to or in excess of $20 million plus certain percentages of the member’s various liabilities.
As mentioned, the new rules follow a raft of new regulation surrounding OTC derivative trades across multiple jurisdictions. Indeed, Finance Magnates reported today that Australia is set to roll out new rules for margin forex and CFD trading, which will be supervised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2015 01:27PM ET</span>",FX pegs under pressure in emerging markets as commodity prices fall,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Plunging commodity prices are testing the viability of emerging currencies' long-standing pegs to the dollar, with some already abandoned as countries balk at the cost of clinging to fixed exchange rates.
Kazakhstan unshackled its tenge last week, and bets are growing that from Hong Kong to Saudi Arabia, dollar pegs are at risk.
""Markets are now questioning the sustainability of other dollar pegs, wondering which will be the next domino to fall,""  Deutsche Bank  (XETRA:DBKGn) told clients.
A peg fixes the value of one currency relative to another and uses central bank reserves to enforce the relationship. Pegs are relatively rare these days among the bigger economies, partly because of the 1997-2002 emerging market crises that were exacerbated by the cost of clinging to fixed exchange rates.
Kazakhstan's tenge has fallen 30 percent  since it was depegged last week under pressure from falling commodity prices and steep depreciation in neighboring Russia's rouble. 
Russia ended its own flexible or ""crawling"" peg to the dollar after burning billions of dollars in reserves to defend the rouble  while Ukraine and Belarus followed suit earlier this year  .
Now pressure is mounting on others, especially ""petro-pegs"" such as in Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.
Justifying the cost of clinging to them will become increasingly difficult for those reliant on commodities and exposed to China's weakening economy, says Simon Quijano-Evans, chief EM strategist at Commerzbank (XETRA:CBKG).
That's especially so as commodity exporters with flexible exchange rates such as Brazil and South Africa start to benefit from their currencies' 10-20 percent depreciation this year. 
Dollar pegs made some sense for countries whose revenues, either from tourism as in the Caribbean or from oil as in the Gulf, are mainly in dollars, especially when commodity prices were high and the dollar was weak.
Now the opposite is true.
""Your economy is going to suffer if your main trade partner is suffering and you cannot allow your currency to adjust while other countries are adjusting theirs,"" Quijano-Evans said.
China this month devalued the yuan, widened its trading band to the dollar and pledged to give markets a greater say in setting daily exchange rates. The yuan's 3 percent fall since then  prompted Vietnam to devalue the dong and widen its own trading band to the dollar .
Mindful of past crises, policymakers will be reluctant to sharply run down reserves to support overvalued currencies.
What's more, the investment flows and export revenues that fed reserve growth are dwindling and current account surpluses have almost vanished.
""Pegs are sustainable only as long as you run a big current account surplus and there are inflows that allow central banks to support their currencies,"" said Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities. 
OVERVALUED
The tenge may provide a clue as to who is next. It looked overvalued prior to its float, standing 11 percent above its average over the decade, Deutsche Bank calculated.
By this measure, Deutsche says, four currencies appear overvalued: the Saudi riyal, the United Arab Emirates dirham, the Nigerian naira and the Egyptian pound, all of them tied to the dollar via ""hard"" or soft, flexible pegs. 
Analysts see the naira and pound as vulnerable, because both countries have limited reserves and are keeping official exchange rates steady only by rationing hard currency. Both have weakened in parallel markets  .
Traders meanwhile are testing Gulf central banks' by pushing currencies down in forward markets - one-year dollar-riyal forwards for instance are at 12-year highs  as traders lock in rates to protect against riyal devaluation.
Saudi reserves of $660 billion mean the authorities can easily defend its 30-year old peg for years, though prolonged oil weakness and rising U.S. interest rates will seriously squeeze finances. 
""You have to distinguish between willingness and the ability (to defend pegs). Saudi, Qatar and UAE have a real safety net, far stronger than in African and some (ex-Soviet) countries,"" said Michael Bolliger, head of EM asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management.
Venezuela, Angola and Algeria, oil producers with managed currencies and lacking deep pockets, are also facing pressure.
Pegs to the euro have been tested too, including the Danish crown's three-decade-old link (EURDKK=), after Switzerland scrapped its exchange rate cap in January. The difference here is that pressure has been upward, with central banks forced to buy euros to hold the pegs.

Similar bets are now evident against the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback. But while Hong Kong may suffer from China's slowdown, it still enjoys large capital inflows, imports energy and has seen reserves rise by $12 billion this year. Few therefore expect it to lose its peg.

Accordingly, regulators have introduced enhanced reporting and clearing requirements for OTC (over the counter) trades in both the U.S. and Europe, effectively pushing the fragmented forex market to become more transparent.
Moreover, technology has hastened the centralization of the market. ECNs that operate as mini-exchanges create pools of liquidity that connect market participants.
According to Chris Concannon, Chief Executive of Bats Global Markets: “End users are getting used to technology where they have a full view of the market. They are accessing more markets than they could ever do 10 years ago.” End users are getting used to technology where they have a full view of the market. Diversifying Nasdaq’s new forex trading platform would seek to rival the current electronic forex trading platforms, including EBS, owned by ICAP PLC (LON: LONDON:IAP), and Thomson Reuters Dealing, owned by Thomson Reuters Corp (TSE: TRI), along with other trading systems offered by major banks.
A move into the forex space would also diversify Nasdaq’a business, which is currently centered on its stock exchange activities, which remain heavily exposed to the current volatility prompted by Chinese markets. Indeed, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed around 3.8% in the recent “Black Monday” stock market crash.
Coupled with the launch of the ""NFX"" platform for trading energy derivatives such as oil, gas and power futures in July, Nasdaq is eager to broaden its remit to include forex trading.
Commenting on the timing of the launch, Mr Jochumsen said, ""We have a system ready that banks can test in their own systems but we don't want to launch it before we have enough banks committed to secure sufficient liquidity."" Exchanges Getting in on the Action Nasdaq’s strategy to develop its own platform differs from rival equities and commodities venues, which have taken the acquisition route to get a slice of the forex market. In recent weeks and months, we have seen both the Deutsche Börse Group and BATS Global Markets, the US’ second largest equities and options exchange, make acquisitions to position themselves as players in the forex market. We have a system ready that banks can test in their own systems but we don't want to launch it before we have enough banks committed to secure sufficient liquidity. In March, BATS successfully completed the acquisition of Hotspot FX from KCG Holdings for about $365 million. For BATS, the acquisition was a strategic priority in a world in which investors are increasingly interested in accessing and trading several asset classes, in which FX represents the largest asset class by volume.

While late last month the Frankfurt-based exchange, Deutsche Börse, announced that it would buy German-based institutional ECN platform, 360T, for €725 million. 360T operates an interbank currency trading platform, including spot, forwards, options and swap products.
Deutsche Börse sees 360T as a key part of its growth strategy, using it as a way to sell market data and develop futures, FX forwards and swaps trading to boost its Eurex derivatives business.
However, the exchanges have been facing headwinds in trying to displace the forex establishment - the well-established platforms and global banks. Hotspot recorded multi-year lows, with an 8.6% MoM decline in July. With a third exchange on the scene, its remains to be seen whether the forex markets can be reigned in to trade via a centralized exchange.

The dollar recovered ground against the yen, with USD/JPY up 0.5% to 119.5, not far from overnight highs of 119.83.
The dollar hit an eight-month trough of 116.18 against the yen earlier in the week before rebounding after China’s central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday for the second time in two months.
The euro was also lower against the greenback, with EUR/USD slipping 0.18% to 1.1499, after falling as low as 1.1465 overnight.
The single currency has been boosted in recent sessions as investors fled to the relative safe-haven currencies amid intense volatility in markets.
Demand for the euro was also underpinned by investors borrowing the low-yielding currency to fund investment in risk assets.
But concerns over whether a free fall in China’s stocks will make the world’s second-largest economy weaker persisted. Shares in Shanghai opened higher on Wednesday, before ending down 1.3% in a volatile session.
Recent steep declines in Chinese equity markets have sparked fears that they will hasten an economic downturn and undermined investor confidence in the government’s ability to revitalize economic growth.
The turmoil in markets began when China unexpectedly devalued the yuan on August 11, sparking fears over the condition of the economy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.18% to 94.09, off the eight-month trough of 92.52 set on Monday.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2015 06:17PM ET</span>",U.S. dollar fails to get usual safety bid from volatility in short term ,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Anirban Nag
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Most bouts of global market volatility in recent years have featured one constant: the U.S. dollar strengthens as investors clamor for the perceived safety of U.S. assets such as Treasuries. 
By contrast, over the last two previous trading days, the dollar lost 4.0 percent against the yen, while dropping to a seven-month low versus the euro on Monday, as world stock markets slumped and emerging market currencies plummeted.
The dollar's weakness may continue in the short term, but analysts expect its longer term rally to continue eventually. 
The greenback is still seen as a refuge for those with the closest links to China such as companies and investors operating in Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand dollars as well as a slew of emerging market currencies. 
In the short term, two factors may be pressuring the dollar against the euro and yen. 
First, an accelerating economic slowdown in China and the resulting volatility in global markets have lowered expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in September, undermining the attractiveness of U.S. dollar assets.
Second, the slump in world stock markets appears to be spooking traders into unwinding ""carry trades"" financed largely in low-yielding euros and yen. 
""Global risk is elevated right now and so the Federal Reserve would be cautious in hiking interest rates,"" said Stephen Jen, a partner at global macro hedge fund SLJ Partners in London. ""That support for the dollar is not there at the moment."" 
DOLLAR HIT BY WANING EXPECTATIONS FOR FED RATE RISE 
In the past year, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) gained about 12 percent, as investors priced in a rise in short term interest rates by the Fed. 
But China's economic slowdown fanned fears of a global slowdown, lowering demand for commodities. A key commodity price index hit a 12 year low (TRJCRB) this week and emerging market stocks and currencies also slumped.
U.S. and European companies which earn revenues in China have also seen their stock prices fall, contributing to the slump in major world stock markets. The benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index has lost more than 12 percent since a May high.
The potential impact of a China slowdown and the resulting global market volatility has cast doubt on the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in September. 
 Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) Bank for example this week changed their forecast on the timing of a Fed rate increase to March 2016 from their earlier call of September, saying that the Fed is ""unlikely to begin a hiking cycle in this environment for fear that such a move may further destabilize markets."" 
Should market conditions stabilize and prove transitory, Fed policy-makers could the end its near zero interest rate policy at their December meeting, they said. 
UNWINDING OF CARRY TRADES ALSO UNDERMINES USD 
The U.S. dollar was also hit in the past few days by traders closing out carry trades in yen and euro in order to protect themselves against further market volatility.
The dollar's slump against the yen was not a surprise since Japan's lower interest rates mean the yen has traditionally been used to fund carry trade investments in higher-yielding assets. In times of financial stress, investors unwind those bets by selling the risky assets and buying back the funding currency. 
The fall against the euro is more unusual, as the euro zone debt crisis in the past few years made the euro an unattractive candidate for a carry trade until the European Central Bank's asset purchase program lowered euro zone interest rates and eased investor fears about European economic growth. 
The options market, in the near-term, sees more U.S. dollar weakness. The ""skew"", a measure of what people are paying for bets on a currency rising or falling, shows expectations for more weakness in the dollar against the euro than at any time in the last year , while the bias for dollar's weakness against the yen is gradually rising.  
""It looks too early to argue that the current financial storm has blown itself out,"" said Chris Turner, global head of strategy at ING in London.
""The uncertainty about the end-point for this Chinese yuan devaluation remains.""
LONGER TERM OUTLOOK FOR U.S. DOLLAR GOOD
Despite the dollar's recent weakness against the euro and the yen, it remains a haven for investors and companies deriving revenues from China by selling commodities from Canada, Australia, as well as for emerging market countries whose currencies have fallen sharply recently. 
Given that U.S. economy continues to grow steadily, making a Fed interest rate likely in the not too distant future, the dollar is likely to resume its uptrend of the past year, analysts said. 

""The euro is no safe haven,"" said SLJ Partners' Jen. ""I expect euro/dollar to top out when the world realizes that European companies are very exposed to emerging markets, more than the United States is.""

689,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2015 05:45PM ET</span>","EUR/USD surges 2% to eight-month high, amid Chinese equity sell-off","Investing.com -- EUR/USD surged more than 2% to its highest level in eight months, as currency traders dumped their positions in the dollar on Monday, amid a global equities sell-off sparked by a potential recession in China.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1370 and 1.1710, before settling at 1.1610 up 2.05% on the session. At one point, the euro soared to its strongest level against the dollar since January 15 nearly erasing all of its losses since the start of the year. Before the pair's recent five-day winning streak, it had been in a holding pattern between 1.08 and 1.15 since the early portions of the spring.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808 the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.2008, the high from January 5.
On Monday, the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 8.5% suffering its sharpest fall since 2007, as a dearth of activity from the People's Bank of China created a market-wide panic. Chinese index futures, meanwhile, fell by their limit of 10% providing strong indications that the downturn will continue. The massive sell-off comes days after Chinese manufacturing data dropped to its lowest level since the Financial Crisis, underscoring persistent sluggishness in the world's second-largest economy. While Chinese GDP grew by 7% over the first half of 2015, many analysts believe China's economy is decelerating and could suffer its slowest full-year growth in a quarter century.
Over the weekend, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) gave approval for local government pension funds to invest in Chinese equities, a policy move that could result in close to $100 billion being invested in stock markets nationwide. The PBOC is also expected to cut the Reserve Ratio Requirement (RRR) or amount that banks are forced to hold in reserves over the next several weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported. The PBOC has lowered the RRR by a total of 200 basis points in three separate cuts since February in an effort to accelerate economic growth. Another reduction of 50 to 100 basis points could pump more liquidity into the economy to stave off a massive capital outflow away from Chinese markets.
Following the activities of the past three days, many investors expected the PBOC to enact short-term measures on Monday to prevent a surge of capital from flowing out of Chinese markets. On Aug. 11, the Chinese central bank spooked global foreign exchange markets by devaluing the yuan by 1.9%, its largest one-day amount in more than a decade. Ever since, the PBOC has been forced to spend nearly $200 billion to prevent the yuan from falling even further below its desired level, the Financial Times reported.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, plummeted more than 1.75% to an eight-month low of 92.54 before settling at 93.38 at the close. By comparison, the index exceeded 97.10 earlier last week.
For the most part, there was little movement in the bond markets in spite of the sell-off in equities. Bond prices increased slightly, as yields on theU.S. 10-Year fell by four basis points or 1.85% for the session. Yields on 10-year treasuries still closed below 2% for the first time since April 28."

The currency pair traded between a range of 1.1229 and 1.1389 before settling at 1.1384, up 0.0144 or 1.28% on Friday’s session. The euro closed higher against the dollar for the third straight session, moving to its highest versus its American counterpart since late-June. While the pair has remained in a holding pattern between 1.08 and 1.14 for the majority of 2015, it is by roughly 4% since the start of the summer.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1411, the high from June 22.
Stocks around the world have suffered a massive sell-off since Wednesday afternoon when the Federal Open Market Committee rattled markets with the release of relatively dovish minutes from its July meeting, which provided indications that persisting weakness in the economy could prompt it to delay an interest rate hike beyond September. The downturn has exacerbated fears of a global economic slowdown, as markets ranging from Wall Street and the U.K. to China entered correction on Friday following declines of more than 10% from recent highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 500 points in Friday’s session, after suffering its worst one-day loss in four years.
The equities crash has sent investors to scurrying to government bonds, as yields continued to plunge. As a result, U.S. Treasuries are in line for one of their strongest months of the year amid soaring bond prices. On Friday, the yield on the U.S. 10-Year fell four basis points to an intraday low of 2.03%, its lowest level since late-April. Yields on 10-year government bonds in Germany and the U.K. also moved lower during Friday’s session.
In overnight trading, reports in China indicated that manufacturing production nationwide has shrunk at its quickest pace in more than six years, illustrating the unrelenting listlessness in the nation’s factory sector. A preliminary reading of the Flash China Caixin PMI for August fell to 47.1, its lowest level since the end of the Financial Crisis. A reading below 50 provides a signal of contraction in the industry. The reading fell considerably below analysts’ forecasts of 47.7 and extended losses from July’s reading of 47.8, when it plummeted to a two-year low.
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has approved a wide range of stimulus initiatives throughout the year in an effort to drive an economy that is experiencing its slowest level of growth in more than a decade. Over the last several months, the Chinese government has lowered its benchmark interest rate twice, cut the Reserve Ratio Requirement (RRR) or amount banks must hold in cash reserves and relaxed rules on margin financing or stock trading with borrowed funds in attempts to spur activity. The PBOC also devalued the yuan by nearly 2% earlier this month in a move aimed at boosting slumping export levels. 
Also on Friday, U.S. crude futures fell below $40 for the first time in six years dropping under a key technical level. The decline in oil prices has weighed on energy companies worldwide, as  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) have seen their shares fall by more than 20% over the last year.

705,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Aug 21, 2015 04:30PM ET</span>",Currency Wars Escalate As China’s Move Triggers a Chain Reaction,"By Christiana Vasiadou
As we are now more than halfway into the third quarter of 2015, substantial divergence still prevails around the world in terms of monetary policy and economic conditions, with certain regions experiencing accelerated growth and several others still struggling. Inflation has reached several decade lows despite monetary policy being extremely loose in most of the developed economies and tight in emerging economies and credit spreads are trading below default rates, while yields still remain near historic lows.
Such low inflation rates around the world, and disinflation caused by sliding oil and other commodity prices, have been triggering a number of central bank responses such as negative interest rates, asset purchases and FX interventions, in summary declaring Currency Wars. Manufacturing activity in China has reached a six-year low Currency war is a tactic used in international affairs with potentially destructive outcomes. Countries enter a race to the bottom in an effort to boost their ailing domestic economies and growth figures by competing against each other in weakening their currency to achieve a relatively low exchange rate. This policy effectively causes countries to “steal exports” and therefore growth from their trading partners. The result can be a potential decline in international trade, eventually harming all countries.
In recent years, countries that have been participating in a competitive devaluation race since 2010, have used a combination of policy tools, including quantitative easing, direct government intervention and imposition of capital controls. From Easy Monetary Policy to Outright Competitive Devaluation Monetary easing measures by BOJ and the ECB, bailouts in Greece and Ireland, Chinese currency manipulation, the unexpected move of SNB to remove the 1.20 peg on the EUR/CHF pair and Sweden dropping the Swedish krona interest rate below zero, have all been indicators of the intensification of the currency wars in recent times. In extreme cases, countries have even resorted to the ultimate measure of imposing capital controls in order to prevent currency outflows, as seen in Greece after the Euro-zone bailout negotiations fell apart last June.
The recent burst of the Chinese stock market bubble has proved to be a major catalyst in global market developments, as it has been adding severe pressure on the Chinese economy, threatening to drag it further down to the slowest pace since 1990. In an effort to put a brake on the stock market decline and deteriorating economic growth, China unexpectedly moved last week towards devaluating its currency, a move that has intensified the continuing currency wars. Furthermore, as the latest figures issued this morning indicate that manufacturing activity in China has reached a six-year low, the possibility of further currency devaluations in the near future is high.
As already discussed in our previous article titled ”Is This the End of the Chinese Stock Market Meltdown or Just the Beginning?”, the bubble was created as share prices had been disconnected from underlying economic fundamentals causing a stock market rise of 150 percent over the past year, which was not justified by dividend yields, return on equity or other financial characteristics of companies.
Even though the Chinese government has persistently been trying to prevent further stock market losses by drawing the line around the 3,500 level for the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SHCOMP), it is questionable whether it will continue to provide support in order to sustain this market level indefinitely, as it is proving to be a very expensive exercise.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), on the other hand, entered a death cross pattern earlier this week, a momentum technical indicator triggered when the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average, signifying further market weakness and contagion in the region, with potential implications on currency moves. Escalating Risks to Global Growth In order to draw the whole picture, there are four major risk factors that are responsible for currency devaluation moves in the developing economies: (1) as already mentioned above, the slowing growth in China resulting in devaluation of the yuan, (2) the collapse of oil prices (3) the possibility of US interest rate hikes (4) the continuing severe recession in Russia. All of these factors are interrelated and affect the economies of various developing countries in a combined manner.
Kazakhstan’s move to abandon its currency-band exchange rate mechanism and adopt a free-floating exchange rate, is the latest sign that emerging countries will not defend their currencies any longer after China shocked the global markets. This central Asian nation, whose major trading partners are Russia and China (as well as the US to a limited extent), has switched to a free float which triggered a 23 percent decline in the tenge to a record low of 257.21 against the US dollar, after its central bank had already spent a staggering amount of 28 billion US dollars to defend the currency during 2014 and 2015.
This news hit the markets just one day after Vietnam's latest devaluation of the dong, the third adjustment so far for this year, in the country’s effort to catch up with regional peers already participating in the currency wars. The State Bank of Vietnam devalued the dong by one percent against the US dollar last Wednesday, while it simultaneously widened the trading band for the second time in six days from two to three percent. Global Markets Rout Furthermore, last week’s devaluation of the yuan triggered a storm of declines in the range of 5% in most emerging market currencies which had already been at multi-year lows, from Russia to Turkey and Malaysia. There are several other countries exporting goods to China that are at risk as a consequence of the yuan’s devaluation, including Brazil, Peru, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea and South Africa. The South African rand slumped beyond 13 against the US dollar for the first time since 2001 while the Brazilian real has been the greatest loser of the developing nation currencies this year, the Turkish lira fell to a historic record low and the Malaysian ringgit traded at a seventeen-year low.
Nigeria and Egypt are two countries heavily exposed to oil, which have so far resisted entering the currency revaluation arena, mainly for political reasons. If their currencies are allowed to float, their cost of living will skyrocket as they heavily rely on imports even for essentials, such as wheat for making bread. It may become inevitable at some point, however, and these countries may also have to enter the currency race to the bottom sooner or later.

By applying competitive devaluation, all of these emerging countries have an opportunity to “import” growth from developed economies. However, the result of all this competitive currency devaluation game gaining momentum around the globe is becoming the new catalyst for the direction of the markets; it could gradually lead to reduced demand for US products in all of these developing countries, subsequently hurting US producers, with growth/high momentum stocks being the first ones to suffer.
This fear of potential growth slowdown being eventually spilled over back to the US is already beginning to cause serious jitters as the stock markets are heading towards the close of their worst week in 2015, which will likely amplify as the currency wars continue to intensify.
Great challenges will therefore continue to persist until the end of this year and beyond, in the effort to restore balance in the global economy. Based on the experience of past currency wars, while one or the other country may be ahead of the race to the bottom in the short-term, most likely no one will end up being a real winner in the end.

706,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Aug 21, 2015 10:20AM ET</span>",Greek Forex Brokers Open for Business Despite Ongoing Restrictions,"By Andy Traveller
As the Greek crisis fades from media focus following the acceptance by Alexis Tsipras of the bailout terms proposed by Greece’s creditors, Finance Magnates catches up with Vasilis Tsaprounis, Chief Economist and CFO of leading Greek broker MagnaFX, to discuss how local forex and CFD brokers have been affected.
Vasilis Tsaprounis, Chief Economist and CFO, MagnaFX
Indeed, the country has faced a number of trading restrictions. The Athens Stock Exchange reopened recently after a 5-week shutdown. Upon opening, Greek banks in particular nosedived, with share prices falling as much as 65% in just three days. Capital controls remain in place and economic data looks dismal, prompting investors to remain cautious.
In such an atmosphere, you would be forgiven for thinking then that Greek brokers must be struggling. However, Mr Tsaprounis was sanguine about their plight, and his firm, MagnaFX, in particular.
“The crisis had a very little impact on us, since our basic model plan continues to be on an institutional level, while the retail business was also intact.”
Indeed, while he notes that “it is taken for granted that the Greek crisis - coming to its zenith with the introduction of capital controls - left a negative 'trace' to the local market”, Greek brokers retain some advantages. Due to the imposed capital controls, without a Greek Custodian Bank, Greek investors can't trade FX and/or CFDs, unless they have a bank account abroad. Specifically, while the volumes of Greek accounts has diminished significantly across the industry and with the imposition of capital controls restricting domestic investors from withdrawing cash from their Greek bank account to trade on foreign platforms, the two Greek forex brokers that are regulated by the Hellenic Capital Markets Commission (HCMC) - namely MagnaFX and AAAFx - continue to serve local investors.

Mr Tsaprounis explains: “Due to the imposed capital controls, without a Greek Custodian Bank, Greek investors can't trade FX and/or CFDs, unless they have a bank account abroad. We are one of the only companies that have a Greek Custodian. From this perspective, among all the companies that are engaged in the FX industry in Greece, only MagnaFX and AAAFx are entirely Greek companies, fully supervised and regulated by HCMC, which can provide FX and/or CFD trading for Greek clientele.”
Of course, Greek brokers also continue to serve foreign customers. In MagnaFX's case, Mr Tsaprounis pointed out that it also has a reputable foreign bank as a custodian, allowing ongoing international trade.
With a Grexit off the table for the time being, it is unlikely that Greek brokers will have to contend with the introduction of a local currency anytime soon. But as Mr Tsaprounis confidently muses: “Nevertheless, an investment company like us, with an exceptional organization, solid administration and high-calibre, experienced staff, not only would not have have any kind of issues in a case of a default State, but definitely would take high advantage of the new status, since we would have another local major offered currency to trade.”

The currency pair traded between 1.1107 and 1.1244 on Thursday, before settling at 1.1239, up 1.08% on the session. It marked the first time the euro closed above 1.12 against the dollar for the month of August. The euro is now up roughly 3.75% against its American counterpart over the last month of trading following the considerable two-day romp.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1411, the high from June 22.
Investors continued to digest the minutes from the FOMC's July meeting on Thursday, ones in which the Fed offered no clear indications on an imminent rate hike. The FOMC appears particularly concerned with the deceleration of inflation, as it continues to remain under its long-term targeted goal of 2%. While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inched up 0.1%, it still fell under analysts' forecasts of a 0.2% monthly gain. The Core CPI Index, which strips out food and energy prices, rose by 1.8% on a yearly basis, also falling below the Fed's target by 0.2%.
The FOMC appears sharply divided on whether inflation is moving close to a level it deems appropriate to start raising short-term rates. The FOMC said by some objectives the inflation data was ""not progressing"" toward its targeted goal, according to the minutes. Other members, however, said that inflation conditions for a rate hike would be met or could be ""met shortly.""
The Fed's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since 2009 at the conclusion of the Financial Crisis. In addition, nearly a decade has passed since the Fed has last raised the benchmark rate. Although Fed chair Janet Yellen has indicated that it is likely the FOMC will lift its benchmark Federal Funds Rate in 2015 if economic conditions continue to improve, the Fed has not said definitively that lift-off will occur in September. Following the dovish reading on Wednesday, a large percentage of inventors now believe it is more likely that lift-off will take place in December.
Elsewhere, Alexis Tsipras formally resigned from his position as Greek prime minister on Thursday, opening the door for snap elections in late-September. The resignation came one day after Greece received the first tranche of a €86 billion bailout from its international creditors, deemed necessary to stave off bankruptcy. Tsipras, who was elected seven months ago, was forced to abandon his Syriza party's anti-austerity platforms in order to secure a critical multi-year bailout through the European Stability Mechanism.
Government bond yields plummeted throughout the globe, amid fears of a worldwide economic slowdown.

As a result, the index fell to its lowest level in more than a month."
710,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Aug 20, 2015 11:20AM ET</span>",China Always Fixed the Yuan to the Dollar - What Changed Now?,"By Jarratt Davis

The Chinese currency is called the ‘renminbi’, and each unit is called a ‘yuan’ – however the term yuan can also be used to refer to the currency generally. Renminbi is to yuan as sterling is to pound. The yuan is divided into two classes – the onshore yuan, CNY, and the offshore yuan, CNH. The CNY and CNH trade at different exchange rates. Both rates are controlled by the People’s Bank of China.
The yuan was pegged to the US dollar, at a flat rate of 8.27 yuan per USD, until 2005 when the peg was lifted and the currency was revalued to 8.11 yuan/USD. The Chinese government began to internationalise the yuan by making foreign trade in the currency more efficient and flexible. Since 2006, the renminbi has been allowed to float in a narrow band around a fixed base rate determined by reference to a basket of world currencies. This is called a managed floating exchange rate system. Under this system the yuan moves based on supply and demand, but the price is then reset the next day.
Under the current exchange rate policy, the yuan is allowed to trade in a 4% band, 2% above or below the PBOC’s daily fix to the USD. Until recently, the Bank would ignore the previous day’s trading when setting the new day’s price fix. However on Thursday, August 11, the PBOC allowed the yuan to devalue by 1.9%. The Bank announced they adjusted the method by which they fix the rate to now take the previous day’s trading into consideration.
This means market forces of supply and demand will have greater influence on the price of yuan. This is one step in China’s long term goal of having the renminbi viewed as a global reserve currency. The following day the PBOC again allowed the previous day’s supply and demand pressures to influence where the price was set and the yuan was devalued a further 1.6%. One USD currently buys about 6.4 CNY.
Going forward the PBOC will set the daily exchange rate at the previous day’s close. This will increase volatility in the currency, compared with the prior system, however the yuan will still remain pegged to the USD and allowed to fluctuate only within 2% of the daily fix.
Being pegged to the USD meant that the yuan had been appreciating against most major currencies due to the USD appreciating in anticipation of interest rate increases. The PBOC saw this as out of line with natural market forces, and an unnecessary burden on Chinese exports. The new fixing regime will likely see the Chinese yuan trade at a price more in line with economic fundamentals.

712,By FinanceMagnates,"<span>Aug 20, 2015 10:50AM ET</span>",Monetary Policy Heating Up But Talk of Currency Wars Overblown,"By Andy Traveller
After the decision by the People’s Bank of China last week, the Chinese central bank, to devalue their currency, the topic of a currency war has once again surfaced.
The term 'currency war', coined by Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega in 2010, refers to the practice in which central banks intentionally devalue their currencies in order to support their export industries. As foreign demand increases, the intention is that domestic industry and employment will benefit. However, the price increase for imports can harm citizens' purchasing power.
The decision by the People’s Bank of China to set the yuan midpoint against the US dollar 1.85% lower than the previous day’s closing level has sent the USD/CNY to a high not seen in three years. And by lowering the costs of buying its manufactured goods, the central bank is giving a boost to all of the important exports industries – drivers of China’s growth for the past three decades. A devalued yuan also has ramifications for countries competing in similar industries to China, particularly in North Asia. As its fifth largest trading partner, the U.S. is particularly sensitive to Chinese currency devaluation. Indeed, David Cay Johnston recently reported on Al Jazeera that in June, China sold $1 billion per day more to the U.S. than it purchased. If the yuan falls by say 10 percent, he says that it will make Chinese goods so much cheaper that the U.S. trade deficit with China could increase by about $66 billion annually. That translates into a likely loss of 190,000 to 640,000 American jobs, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute.
Of course, a devalued yuan also has ramifications for countries competing in similar industries to China, particularly in North Asia. Thus, while the idea of a global currency war may be overblown, there may be regional reactions. Countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Japan compete against China in a lot of similar markets. And now suddenly they see that they are slightly less competitive. This may lead to a desire to depreciate their currencies. An Overreaction However, the inflammatory term ‘currency war’ may simply refer to the legitimate prerogative of a country to competitively devalue its currency to support a struggling export economy. The distinction may also be blurred with prudent monetary policy, such as quantitative easing (QE), which seeks to bolster domestic economies.
In fact, just today, European Central Bank policymaker, Ewald Nowotny, dismissed suggestions that central banks around the world were racing to weaken their currencies to gain an export advantage, according to Reuters. There is no way of currency wars. I don't see this happening, in any case not in Europe but also don't see this worldwide. ""There is no way of currency wars. I don't see this happening, in any case not in Europe but also don't see this worldwide,"" he told a panel discussion.
Moreover, it is hard to accuse countries of provoking a currency war when their stated objective is to support the domestic economy – via QE, for example. Indeed, the Bank of Japan maintains that its QE policy is in support of the domestic economy, and that the (competitive) devaluation of the yen is simply a secondary consequence.
Likewise, Mr. Nowotny added that the ECB was committed to its quantitative easing programme of asset purchases to stimulate the euro zone economy. ""There is clearly no signal that we may end this programme ahead of the time horizon that we have set,"" he said.

The Chinese central bank also portrays the recent move to devalue its currency as a shift towards a more liberalized exchange rate, saying that it is the first time that market forces have been allowed to determine the exchange rate rather than the People’s Bank of China itself.
Thus, while fears may exist that currency wars are on the rise, the concept itself may be inflated.

Kazakhstan’s currency, the tenge, plunged in value on Thursday against the U.S. dollar, seeing an unprecedented dip of 23 percent after the currency was allowed to float freely.
The country eased controls on its exchange rate, joining a growing number of developing markets that are abandoning efforts to prop up their currencies ahead of the U.S. raising its interest rates.
Prime Minister Karim Massimov announced at a government meeting in the capital Astana that the country has switched to a free-floating currency and will now seek to contain inflation with its monetary policy. The shift “will create the necessary conditions for a recovery of economic growth, increased lending and investment activity, creation of new jobs and a decrease in the inflation rate to between 3 percent and 4 percent in the medium term,” he said, according to Bloomberg.
The move by Astana comes shortly after China devalued the yuan, prompting a rout in regional Asian markets. On Wednesday, Vietnam devalued the dong for the third time this year. Russia’s ruble has also lost over half its value since last year.
Kazakhstan is Central Asia’s biggest exporter of crude oil, and its economy has been hit hard by sliding oil prices around the world. The country’s biggest trading partners, China and Russia, have also seen their economies slow down.
Central bank Governor Kairat Kelimbetov reportedly said that the currency was expected to stabilize after five to seven days, and added that the central bank is not targeting a specific inflation rate, but is trying to reach a stable rate governed by supply and demand.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev said Wednesday that the country would have to adapt to the economic changes brought about by low oil prices. ""The head of state stressed that due to the new economic reality it is needed to adapt to oil prices at $30-40 per barrel,"" the presidential press service said, as cited by Reuters.
Kazakhstan is stepping up its economic cooperation with both China and Russia. In March, the country finalized $24 billion in economic deals with China -- Kazakhstan is a central part of Beijing’s plan for a “new silk road” that would create an economic corridor spanning Central Asia.
Russia has also been wooing the oil exporter. Russian President Vladimir Putin in March proposed a currency union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus."

The currency pair traded between 1.1018 and 1.1135, before settling at 1.1121, up 0.0096 or 0.87% on the session. The euro closed above 1.11 against the dollar for the first time in four sessions. After Wednesday's gains, EUR/USD is now up by more than 2.65% over the last month of trading.

Following the completion of its July FOMC meeting three weeks ago, the Fed provided no explicit indications that it could raise short-term interest rates when it meets next in September. At the time, the Fed reiterated that it needed to see further improvements in the U.S. labor market and signals that long-term inflation had moved gradually toward its target of 2% before it decided to hike interest rates. The minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday showed that the Fed could continue to take a ""data-driven"" approach over the next weeks, before determining whether to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006 when it meets next in September.
On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of July ticked up 0.1%, following solid gains of 0.3% and 0.4% in June and May respectively. A modest gain in apparel prices failed to offset declines in electricity and auto prices. Airfare prices also weighed on the July CPI, after plunging 5.6% -- its sharpest monthly drop in two decades. Analysts expected the July CPI to increase 0.2% on a monthly basis.
The BLS' headline inflation reading also increased 0.2% on a year-over-year basis, after posting a yearly gain of 0.1% in June. The Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, also inched up 0.1% from its June level, below expectations for a 0.2% monthly gain. Over the last 12 months, the core reading has increased 1.8% after remaining unchanged from June.
The muted inflationary gains could appease dovish sentiments at the Fed for a delayed rate hike. Long-term inflation has failed to reach the Fed's annual 2% target for every month over the last three years.
A reading of the July minutes paints a picture of a sharply divided FOMC regarding their views on inflation. The FOMC said by some objectives the inflation data was ""not progressing"" toward its targeted goal, according to the minutes. Other members, however, said that inflation conditions for a rate hike would be met or could be ""met shortly.""
The Fed's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% since 2009 at the conclusion of the Financial Crisis. In addition, nearly a decade has passed since the Fed has last raised the benchmark rate.
In June, all 17 members of the FOMC expected that the Federal Funds Rate should remain under 1% by the end of 2015, according to the Fed's Dot Plot, which provides a long-term forecast on the path of interest rates. However, the median member projected that the Federal Funds Rate will be between a range of 0.5 and 0.75% at that point -- signaling a rate hike at some point this year and an end to a zero interest rate policy.

Hours before the Fed minutes are made public on Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will issue its Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July. Last week, Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer expressed concern with the lack of inflation in the U.S. economy due to slower than expected growth. The Fed would like to see long-term inflation move toward its targeted goal of 2% before it starts to raise interest rates.
For the July report, consensus forecasts expect the CPI to tick up 0.2% after solid monthly gains of 0.3% and 0.4% in June and May respectively. During its last monthly report, the CPI moved steadily upward in spite of record monthly declines in hospital services by 1.1%. The headline CPI also received a boost in June from a rise in energy prices, which increased by 1.7% for the month.
Energy prices, however, since late-June have crashed approximately 25% amid record oversupply on the global markets. The massive decline in crude prices has caused economists to temper their expectations for further gains in inflation.  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:PARIS:PARIS:BNPP), for instance, has lowered its inflation forecast for January, 2016 to around 1.75% from above 2% in mid-June.

On Monday the People’s Bank of China set the midpoint rate slightly firmer than at Friday’s close, easing fears that the currency is headed for a prolonged decline.
The yuan posted its largest ever weekly decline and fell to four-year lows after China’s central bank cut the fixing by 1.9% last Tuesday, the biggest drop since 1994.

The unexpected move sparked fears that China would continue allow the yuan to depreciate, which could trigger a global currency war.
China’s central bank said Thursday that there was no basis for further depreciation in the yuan, in a bid to reassure jittery global markets.

In Brussels, the euro group of finance ministers approved a deal on Friday night to provide Greece with up to €86 billion in stimulus aid, drawing upon the framework of an agreement agreed earlier this week. Euro zone officials anticipate releasing the first tranche of funding, a reported sum of €26 billion, next Wednesday in advance of a bond obligation due to the European Central Bank on August 20. In addition, a reported €10 billion is being set aside to help recapitalize a host of Greek banks that remain on the verge of bankruptcy.
The remaining portions of the initial tranche this year could be paid by the end of the fall, euro group leaders said during a press conference on Friday night. Greece's willingness to enact significant pension reforms over the next several months could compel the International Monetary Fund to participate in the bailout program by October, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the euro group.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said Friday that its Producer Price Index for final demand (PPI-FD) rose by 0.2 for the month of July, as a spike in trade services pushed wholesale prices up moderately. Analysts expected an increase of 0.1 in the headline reading for the month. In spite of the monthly gains, the index still remained down by 0.8 on a year-over-year basis.
The core PPI-FD, which strips out food and energy prices, ticked up by 0.3 for July even as yearly growth decelerated. For the month of July, the reading increased by 0.6, below significant gains of 0.8 a month earlier. The data did not account for the continuing decline in oil prices over the first two weeks of August.
Separately, the Federal Reserve's monthly index of industrial production rose by 0.6% in July on the back of a 10.6% surge in motor vehicle production. Economists anticipated an increase of 0.4% on the month. In addition, manufacturing jumped by 0.8% on the month above analysts' forecasts for a 0.4% gain.

The Chinese yuan inched toward stability on Thursday since a surprise sharp weakening earlier this week led to market volatility, opening flat against Wednesday's close and even slightly stronger than the morning central parity fixing.
On Wednesday, the yuan opened trade at 6.4300, sharply lower than Tuesday's close of 6.3231, following something of a pattern in the two days since the PBOC announced its new central parity fixing method, opening sharply lower to match the drop in the central parity and then hovering around that opening price for the rest of the day.
Thursday's opening price, which failed to match the drop in the fixing, may indicate that the yuan is on its way back to stability. Ma Jun, the chief economist of the PBOC's research bureau, again played down talk of depreciation in state media on Thursday morning, arguing that the currency is near its equilibrium level.
He said the PBOC is more than capable of stabilizing the exchange rate.

Separately, Dudley echoed the sentiments of several of his colleagues on the timing of the Fed's first interest rate hike since 2006.

On Wednesday, the yuan opened trade at 6.4300, sharply lower than Tuesday's close of 6.3231, following something of a pattern in the two days since the PBOC announced its new central parity fixing method, opening sharply lower to match the drop in the central parity and then hovering around that opening price for the rest of the day.
Thursday's opening price, which failed to match the drop in the fixing, may indicate that the yuan is on its way back to stability. Ma Jun, the chief economist of the PBOC's research bureau, again played down talk of depreciation in state media on Thursday morning, arguing that the currency is near its equilibrium level.
He said the PBOC is more than capable of stabilizing the exchange rate.
The PBOC set the yuan central parity at 6.4010 Thursday, down another 1.1% against Wednesday's fixing, following Wednesday's 1.6% and Tuesday's 1.86% devaluations.

774,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 12, 2015 02:30AM ET</span>",Yuan Falls To 4-Year-Low,"By Kukil Bora -

China’s yuan fell to a four-year low in early Wednesday trading, slipping further a day after the country’s central bank devalued the currency to make its exports more competitive and boost sluggish economic growth. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), which described the move as a one-off step, also sought to reassure markets that the current trend will not lead to a steady depreciation.
On Wednesday, spot yuan dropped as much as 1.6 percent to 6.43 per dollar, its weakest level since August 2011, after the PBOC set its daily midpoint reference weaker than Tuesday's devaluation. The currency fell even further in offshore trades, touching 6.57. And though the central bank pledged to keep the yuan at a “stable” and “reasonable” level, it warned of temporary volatility ahead.
“Indeed, we think it would be unwise to allow a large depreciation at this time, given the sizable capital outflows recorded in the first half of the year,” Craig Botham, emerging-market economist at  Schroders  (LONDON:SDR), a British multinational asset management company, told the Wall Street Journal. “Entrenching expectations of depreciation would serve only to exacerbate those outflows and potentially destabilize the financial system.”
While a cheaper yuan could strengthen Chinese exports, it will also put pressure on China’s trade rivals, such as South Korea and Japan, to allow their currencies to fall, raising risks of market volatility and a race to devalue currencies in other emerging markets.
“While it is too early to say whether this is the beginning of a sustained devaluation of the yuan, other central banks may be forced to follow suit and that may trigger a fresh round of currency weakening around the emerging world,” Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed income at Schroders in Singapore, told Reuters.
A Bank of Korea official told the Journal that the yuan's devaluation is ""not a simple but a complex issue that can have simultaneously conflicting ramifications on Korea,"" and that the bank would keep an eye on the currency.
Amid fears of a rush to widespread devaluation of competitive currencies and the impact China's move could have on short-term monetary policy moves, the International Monetary Fund welcomed the PBOC’s devaluation of the yuan.
“The new mechanism for determining the central parity of the Renminbi announced by the PBC appears a welcome step as it should allow market forces to have a greater role in determining the exchange rate,” the IMF said, in a statement Tuesday. “The exact impact will depend on how the new mechanism is implemented in practice.”
The U.S. Federal Reserve said that China's currency devaluation is unlikely to distract it from its focus on the domestic economy. At the same time, the U.S. central bank will remain cautious about further competitive devaluations that could send the dollar much higher than its rise against the yuan on Tuesday, and complicate the Fed's outlook on rates, which were widely expected to be hiked in September, before China's move.
“Yuan devaluation is disinflationary as all imports from China become cheaper,” Zhiwei Ren, managing director and portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, told the Journal. “There is even less reason to hike in September now.”
However, Peter Hooper, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  (XETRA:DBKGn) Securities and a former Fed economist, told Reuters: “I don't see this affecting the Fed decision unless it develops into something that roils markets substantially,” adding: “It adds a little more drag to the economy via net exports and puts a slight damper on consumer prices, but not enough to alter the course of the U.S. economy or labor market significantly.”

779,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 11, 2015 06:04PM ET</span>","EUR/USD moves higher amid Greek breakthrough, Chinese yuan devaluation","Investing.com -- EUR/USD moved slightly higher on Tuesday as China spooked foreign exchange markets worldwide with an unexpected devaluation of the yuan, sparking concerns of a potential global currency war.
Separately, Greece agreed on the framework of a multi-year, €86 billion bailout from its international creditors, one officials hope can be completed before the deadline for a critical repayment of a loan expires next week. The deal comes nearly a month after the sides revived talks following a last-minute, historic accord in Brussels. Without the deal, it was feared the cash-strapped nation could default on its sovereign debt and bolt out of the euro triggering possible contagion throughout the zone.
EUR/USD wavered between 1.0961 and 1.1086 on Tuesday, before settling at 1.1042, up 0.0023 or 0.21%. The currency pair closed above 1.10 for the second straight day after closing below the key technical level for 10 previous sessions. The euro is relatively flat against the dollar over the last month, following a minor rally during the last several sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808 the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1114, the high from July 31.
Both Greece and its troika of creditors are optimistic the comprehensive bailout can be completed next week ahead of a €3.2 billion obligation the Greek government must repay to the European Central Bank. Greece reportedly agreed to enact a series of at least 35 fiscal modifications to unlock the critical aid. The measures include: sale of state property, significant pension and spending cuts and a gradual phasing out of early retirement benefits.
In China, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi to 6.2298 against the dollar on Tuesday, resulting in a 1.9% adjustment from Monday's level of 6.1162 versus the greenback. In response, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst one-day decline in more than a decade and fell to its lowest in three years since the central bank widened the trading band against the dollar in April, 2012.
It represents the sharpest one-day loss since China abandoned its currency peg for a managed float in January, 1994, as part of a broader series of reforms to promote a new ""socialist market economy."" During the seminal event more than 20 years ago, China devalued the yuan 33% to 8.7% against the dollar. A central bank maintains a managed float system by periodically intervening to change the value of its currency in periods of severe economic volatility.
Over the weekend, the bank reported that Chinese exports in July plummeted by 8.3%, marking its sharpest drop in more than three months. Then, on Monday, China said its Producer Price Index also plunged 5.4% last month, extending its longstanding streak of monthly declines to 40.
The dollar initially moved higher following a sell-off in Asian markets before closing sharply lower for the session. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, closed at 97.20, down 0.52% for the session.
Elsewhere, the ZEW index of German economic sentiment dipped to 25.0, from 29.7 in July. Analysts expected a reading of 32.0. EUR/JPY rose 0.58% to 138.14, while GBP/JPY gained 0.91% to 194.85."

790,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 11, 2015 01:15AM ET</span>",A Surprise Devaluation For The Yuan,"By Avaneesh Pandey -

China on Tuesday sharply devalued its currency amid weakening exports and slowing economic growth. The latest move by China’s central bank -- which it described as a “one-off depreciation”-- left the yuan almost 2 percent weaker against the U.S. dollar.
The move by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is a significant one in that it highlights the Chinese government's concerns about falling exports amid an overheated real estate market, which have in recent weeks contributed to major volatility in the country's stock exchanges, prompting several major measures to stem the rout and pacify investors.
“Since China's trade in goods continues to post relatively large surpluses, the yuan’s real effective exchange rate is still relatively strong versus various global currencies,” the bank said, in a statement released Tuesday. “Thus, it is necessary to further improve the yuan’s midpoint pricing to meet market needs.”
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) maintains tight control over the country’s currency -- setting a daily rate for the yuan versus the dollar. The yuan is allowed to fluctuate by 2 percent based on the previous day’s trading. However, on Tuesday, the center of the trading band was set 1.9 percent below Monday’s level -- weakening the midpoint to 6.2298 per dollar, compared with Monday’s 6.1162 mid-point. This makes it the biggest-ever one-day adjustment to the midpoint in a decade.
“It looks like this is the end of the fixing as we know it,” Khoon Goh, a Singapore-based strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., told Bloomberg. “The one-off devaluation of the fix and allowing more market-based determination takes us into a new currency regime.”
The move comes just days after China’s exports reported a drastic slump -- falling 8.3 percent over the past year in July. A weaker currency is likely to help China’s exporters. However, the move might reignite criticism against the Chinese government -- which has, in the past been accused of keeping its currency artificially low -- and increase pressure on central banks around the world to devalue their own currencies.
Following the announcement, the Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.4 percent -- trading at 3912.8 -- a day after posting its largest daily percentage gain in a month. The smaller Shenzhen Component index was up 0.1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.96 percent. The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, was trading up 0.3 percent.
“The risk is that depreciation triggers capital flight, dealing a blow to the stability of China’s financial system,” Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg Intelligence, reportedly wrote in a research note."

The currency pair wavered between 1.0925 and 1.1041 on Monday, before settling at 1.1020, up 0.0056 or 0.51%. The euro closed above 1.10 against its American counterpart for the first time in more than 10 sessions. After a recent surge, EUR/USD is now relatively flat over the last 30 days of trading down roughly by 0.13%.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0874, the low from August 6 and was met with resistance at 1.1114, the high from July 31.
Following a weekend of productive talks in Athens, a spokesperson from the European Commission indicated that a deal on a bailout that could provide Greece with up to €86 billion in critical aid could be finalized by the end of August. Greece and its international creditors are working on finishing a deal by August 20 when Greece owes the European Central Bank a loan repayment of €3.5 billion. If a deal is not reached by next Thursday, the two sides could agree on additional bridge financing to enable Greece to make the payment on time.
Elsewhere, in a speech to the Atlanta Press Club on Monday Federal Reserve of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart indicated that the Fed is close to raising interest rates as the economy continues to return to near normal levels. Lockhart's comments came three days after the U.S. Department of Labor released relatively solid jobs figures on Friday in its monthly national employment situation report.
During the month of July, the U.S. labor market added 215,000 non-farm payrolls, in line with consensus estimates of a 212,000 gain. The figure received a boost from a 60,000 gain in Trade & Transportation jobs, as well as a 40,000 increase in Professional & Business service positions. The Labor Department also upwardly revised non-farm payrolls for June by 8,000 to 231,000.
Earlier on Monday, Fed governor Stanley Fischer struck a more dovish tone telling Bloomberg TV that it is not a certainty that lift-off will occur in September. Fischer is widely considered the second-highest ranking official at the Fed behind chair Janet Yellen.
""The interesting situation in which we are is that employment has been rising pretty fast relative to previous performance and yet inflation is very low,"" Fischer told Bloomberg. ""And the concern about the situation is not to move before we see inflation as well as employment returning to more normal levels.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.5% on Monday before closing at 97.21. Last week, the index soared to a four-month high above 98.40."

810,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 07, 2015 05:13PM ET</span>",EUR/USD posts third straight winning session amid solid U.S. jobs report,"Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose considerably on Friday extending its winning streak to a third straight session, as steady gains in the U.S. labor market last month bolstered the case for a September interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
The currency pair traded in a range between 1.0856 and 1.0978 during Friday's session, before settling at 1.0961, up 0.0037 or 0.34%. Despite the minor rally at the end of this week, EUR/USD still closed the week virtually unchanged declining by less than 0.10% from its level at the start of Monday's trade. Over the last month, the dollar has gained approximately 0.80% against its European counterpart.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1131, the high from July 27.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said the number of non-farm payrolls in the nation during the month of July increased by 215,000, in line with consensus estimates of a 212,000 gain. The figure received a boost from a 60,000 gain in Trade & Transportation jobs, as well as a 40,000 increase in Professional & Business service positions. The Labor Department also upwardly revised non-farm payrolls for June by 8,000 to 231,000.
In addition, waged ticked up by 0.2 % after remaining flat in June – representing an increase of 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.3%, also in line with consensus estimates of 5.3%. Earlier this week, Fed governor Jerome Powell said he would take a data-driven approach to the timing of a September rate hike, placing particular emphasis on the strength of the labor market over the next month.
The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader gauge of the national employment situation, inched down 0.1% to 10.4% on the moth. The reading, which measures the total level of unemployed workers plus those marginally attached to the labor force, as well as those who are no longer looking for a job but have looked for one over the last 12 months, stood at 12.6% last July. By comparison, the U-6 rate peaked above 17% during the height of the financial crisis. It is also a preferred measure of Fed chair Janet Yellen, as she weighs whether the labor market has improved to the point which would warrant an imminent rate hike.
The dollar, meanwhile, moved broadly higher following the release of the report, before falling back sharply near the close. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged to a four-month high at 98.41 before turning negative for the session at 97.67, down 0.21%.
The report had a muted impact on the government bond market, as yields on U.S. Treasuries remained virtually unchanged at the end of Friday's session. Yields on 2-Year Treasuries, which are typically sensitive to major monetary policy changes from the Fed, initially climbed to 0.75% to move near a four-year high following the release. The U.S. 2-Year, however, ended the session at 0.72%, up only two basis points for the day."

The currency pair traded between 1.0879 and 1.0987 during Tuesday's session, before settling at 1.0886 – down 0.5E9% on the session. The euro closed lower against its American counterpart for the sixth time in seven sessions, closing under 1.09 for the first time since July 20. Over the last month of trading, the euro is down approximately 2% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1131, the high from July 27.
On Tuesday afternoon, Greek officials said they were confident a deal on a comprehensive bailout could be completed over the next two weeks before it owes a €3.5 billion loan repayment to the European Central Bank (ECB) on August 20. If a deal is not completed, Greece will likely need to secure a second round of bridge financing in order to make the payment on time.
Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is expected to conclude week-long discussions with officials from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and ECB at the end of this week. Last month, Greece and its international creditors agreed on the framework of a deal that could provide the cash-strapped nation with up to €86 billion over a period of three years needed to stave off bankruptcy. Officials from both sides of the negotiating table characterized Tuesday's talks as a step in the right direction. In addition, the European Council announced on Tuesday that it has approved a change in the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) that could provide Greece with additional bridge financing, if necessary.
In the U.S., factory orders for the month of June rose 1.8%, just above analysts' expectations for a 1.7% gain.

In May, factory orders declined by 1.0% on a month-over-month basis as aircraft orders fell by 32% in comparison with its April level.

The dollar pared gains after data showed that U.S. consumer spending slowed in June and another report showing that manufacturing activity moderated in July.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose just 0.2% in June, after a downwardly revised 0.7% increase in May. It was the slowest rate of increase in four months.
Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 52.7 from 53.5 in June.
The output and new orders components of the index both rose, but the employment component of the index fell to 52.7 from 55.5.
Another report showed that U.S. construction spending ticked up just 0.1% in June, the smallest increase since January.
The disappointing economic reports dented dollar demand ahead of Friday’s U.S. jobs report for July. The Federal Reserve has said that a strengthening labor market is a key factor in determining the timing of interest rate hikes.
The euro fell to session lows earlier in the day as the Greek stock market posted steep losses in the first day of trade following a five-week shutdown.
The main Athens stock index fell almost 23% at the open, before recovering slightly, with banking shares, which comprise about 20% of the Greece index, hardest hit.
Trading on the Athens bourse was suspended at the height of the Greek debt crisis in late June as part of capital controls imposed to stem outflows that threatened to collapse the country's banking system.
The euro found some support after data on Monday showed that the euro area manufacturing sector continued to expand at a steady pace at the start of the third quarter.
The final reading of the euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers' index for July came in at 52.4, up from the initial estimate of 52.2.
Continuing expansion in Germany, Spain and Italy offset a record contraction of the Greek manufacturing sector last month after capital controls were imposed.
The single currency edged higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY at 136.11, while USD/JPY was at 123.95, off earlier highs of 124.28.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 97.36.

878,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2015 10:46PM ET</span>",Former CEO of collapsed Mt.Gox bitcoin exchange arrested in Japan: reports,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Mark Karpeles, the former head of defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the virtual currency, Japanese media reports said.
The French-born Karpeles, 30, is suspected of falsifying data on the outstanding balance of the exchange, at one point the world's largest hub for trading the digital currency, they added.
Police were unable to immediately confirm the reports.
When it filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, Mt. Gox said 750,000 customer bitcoins and another 100,000 belonging to the exchange were stolen due to a software security flaw. 
The lost funds represented the equivalent of $480 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing. Mt. Gox also said more than $27 million was missing from its Japanese bank accounts.
Karpeles, who had blamed hackers for the loss, later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins.
Known as a self-proclaimed geek who said he was uncomfortable in his native France and hadn't been back in years, Karpeles became interested in bitcoin when a customer of his web-hosting services wanted to pay in the virtual currency. 

Mt. Gox subsequently shot from obscurity to dominate global trade in bitcoin, but as early as 2012 employees at the Tokyo-based exchange challenged Karpeles on issues such as whether client money was being used to cover costs.

879,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2015 05:30PM ET</span>","EUR/USD rises sharply, amid historically low U.S. wage growth for 2Q","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose considerably on Friday, amid staggering data which indicated that U.S. wage growth for the second quarter increased by the lowest level in more than 30 years.
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0921 and 1.1113 during Friday's session, before settling at 1.0985, up 0.0051 or 0.47%. For July, EUR/USD fell by 1.35% after wavering between 1.08 and 1.12 in a see-saw month of trading as the Greek bailout and the dramatic fall of the Chinese equities markets provided significant downward pressure.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0810, the low from July 21 and was met with resistance at 1.1198, the high from July 13.
The U.S. Department of Labor said on Friday morning that its Employment Cost Index rose 0.2% for the second quarter, the lowest in the 33-year history of the report. On a year-over-year basis the index plunged 0.6% to 2.0%, posting one of its lowest readings ever. Within the report, wages and salaries fell considerably by 0.5% from the first quarter to 0.2%. The metric, which is closely watched by the Fed, will likely appease dovish arguments for a delayed interest rate hike.
The poor data pushed yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries down more than eight basis points to 2.184, their lowest level in more than three weeks. For the week, yields on the 10-year experienced their worst five-day period since April, as plunging commodity values continued to weigh.
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its two-day July meeting without offering any indications on whether it will adjust its benchmark Federal Funds Rate later this fall. U.S. short-term interest rates have remained level between zero and 0.25% for nearly six years since the end of the Financial Crisis. Nearly a decade has passed since the Federal Reserve last instituted a rate hike.
In Athens, an initial round of negotiations between Greece and its international creditors from the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund on a new bailout were characterized as generally positive. One day earlier, IMF officials declared that they would not participate in a three-year,€86 billion Greek bailout unless the program included significant debt relief and economic reforms.
After remaining closed for a period of several weeks, the Athens Stock Exchange is set to reopen on Monday.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, lost nearly 0.40% on Friday's session to close at 97.32. Despite the slight losses, the index closed the month up more than 1.7%."

It came one day after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) observed signs of an improving U.S. labor market and economy in its latest monetary policy statement.

As expected, the FOMC kept short-term interest rates unchanged without offering any indications on whether it could begin raising its benchmark Federal Funds Rate later this fall. U.S. short-term interest rates have remained level between zero and 0.25% for nearly six years since the end of the Financial Crisis. Nearly a decade has passed since the Federal Reserve last instituted a rate hike.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve policymakers did not raise short-term interest rates from near zero at their Federal Open Market Committee, but their policy statement seemingly left the FOMC on course to raise them before long.
The Fed has kept the overnight federal funds rate, and in turn other rates, near zero since December 2008.

904,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2015 06:12PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls after Fed notes signs of improved labor market, economy","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply on Wednesday, as the Federal Reserve observed signs of an improving U.S. labor market and economy in its latest monetary policy statement without offering any indications on whether it could begin hiking interest rates later this fall.
EUR/USD traded in a tight range between 1.0967 and 1.1084, before settling at 1.0984 down 0.68% on the session. The currency pair has closed below 1.10 in 11 of the last 13 sessions, amid intense speculation that the Federal Open Market Committee could start raising short-term interest rates during its September meeting.
U.S. short-term interest rates have remained at its current level between zero and 0.25% for nearly six years since the end of the Financial Crisis. Nearly a decade has passed since the Federal Open Market Committee last instituted a rate hike. On Wednesday, the FOMC left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged for the 53rd consecutive meeting. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0808 the low on July 20 and was met with resistance at 1.1131, the high from July 27.
Following the completion of its two-day July meeting on Wednesday, the FOMC said the labor market has shown signs of progressing, citing indicators that showed the underutilization of labor resources have diminished in recent months. Last month, the U.S. unemployment rate fell by 0.2% to 5.3%.
""The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment,"" the FOMC said in the statement. ""The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.""
Still, the Fed remains concerned with the slow pace of inflation as energy prices have fallen by approximately 20% since its last meeting. The Fed reiterated on Wednesday that it will likely raise the Fed Funds Rate when it sees further improvements in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back toward its targeted goal of 2%. Long-term inflation has not reached the Fed's targeted level during a single FOMC meeting over the last three years.
""This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments,"" the FOMC added.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries fell initially after the statement's release, but closed at session highs of 2.29%, up four basis points. Yields on German 10-Year bunds rose three basis points to 0.72%.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.1022 and 1.11 on Tuesday, before settling at 1.1056, down 0.0030 or 0.27%.

Short-term interest rates, meanwhile, have remained level between zero and 0.25% since the end of the Financial Crisis.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose to an intraday high of 97.08 before falling back slightly to 96.75, up 0.15%. The dollar pared some of its gains amid weak consumer sentiment, after The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index  fell to 90.9 for July from 99.8 a month earlier.
In Athens, security tightened throughout the city ahead of the arrival of a troika of Greece's international creditors for the latest round of talks on a comprehensive three-year bailout. The creditors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are expected to complete technical work on bailout discussions by Friday, officials from the Greece Finance ministry said. Greece government officials said last week they were hopeful that a deal on a proposed €86 billion bailout through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could be completed by late-August.

Shortly later, however, the dollar moved lower after the U.S. Commerce Department said new home sales plunged 6.8% in June to 482,000. Median home prices remained soft at $281,000.
Elsewhere, U.S. 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proposed a wave of corporate tax reforms on Friday, including a plan that will nearly double the capital gains tax rate on short-term investments. Clinton, the Democratic Party frontrunner, is also proposing increased transparency for stock buybacks and changes to executive compensation.
In Europe, the Markit flash euro zone PMI fell to 53.7 in July, down from a four-year high of 54.2 in June. The decline reflected a slowdown in the manufacturing and service sectors throughout the zone, as well as a dip in consumer confidence.
Currency traders await next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting for further hints on the timing of a much-awaited interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Earlier this week, Federal St. Louis president James Bullard said there is a 50% chance the Fed will raise rates at its FOMC meeting in September. It came days after Fed chair Janet Yellen reiterated that conditions in the economy are likely to justify an interest rate hike at some point this year. Nearly a decade has passed since the U.S. central bank last lifted its benchmark Federal Funds Rate. For nearly six years, short-term interest rates have remained level between zero and 0.25% since the end of the Financial Crisis.
On Friday, the Fed announced that it inadvertently published a staff forecast on its website which disclosed that staff economists anticipate a quarter-point rate hike at some point this year.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2015 11:41PM ET</span>",Dollar near five-week peak vs yen on Fed official's hawkish comments,"By Shinichi Saoshiro
TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near five-week highs versus the yen on Tuesday after a top Federal Reserve official added to expectations that U.S. interest rates could be raised as early as September.
The dollar index was little changed at 98.036 (DXY) and near a three-month high of 98.147 scaled overnight.
The greenback received a boost after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told the Fox Business network on Monday that the central bank is likely to raise rates in September as inflation is set to climb toward its target and unemployment is poised to dip below 5 percent.
U.S. Treasury yields, notably those of shorter-dated maturities like two-year bills, rose in response to Bullard's comments and shored up the dollar.
The dollar was flat at 124.35 yen, not far from a five-week high of 124.39 reached overnight. The greenback still took another step closer to the 13-year peak of 125.86 reached in early June.
The U.S. currency has climbed steeply from a low near 120 yen plumbed at the start of the month when angst over the Greek debt crisis and sliding China shares triggered a rush toward the safe-haven Japanese currency, but the 125 threshold could be a tough ceiling to top.
""The approach to 125 yen takes dollar/yen into politically sensitive territory. Any big gains by the dollar just as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks are climaxing could stimulate those on both sides of the Pacific opposed to the negotiations, and the authorities would not want that,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
Ministers from the 12-nation TPP trade pact negotiations will meet July 28-31 in Maui, Hawaii, aiming to reach a broad agreement. The meeting is likely to mark the final stage in the TPP negotiations, a massive trade pact covering 40 percent of the world's economy.
REDUCED VOLATILITY
The euro treaded water at $1.0827 <EUR=>. The common currency hit a three-month trough of $1.0808 overnight, slipping steadily after a debt deal that will keep Greece in the euro zone for the time being shifted investor focus back to diverging U.S. and European monetary policies.
The twin themes that kept the markets on edge over the past month - the Greek debt saga and turbulence in Chinese equities - have gone on the back burner for now, as reflected in part by the decline in implied volatility.
Bets on how volatile eight major G10 currency crosses will be over the next three months are at the lowest since the Swiss National Bank removed the euro/Swiss franc floor in January, Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at CitiFX in New York, wrote.
Three-month sterling/dollar implied volatility <GBP3MO=R> was roughly at its lowest since January, while that of the euro/dollar <EUR3MO=> was near a 4-1/2-month low. Dollar/yen implied volatility <JPY3MO=> recently hit its lowest since early May.
""It is a clear signal that investors expect a quiet summer, but may also tell you something about the memory span of FX investors,"" Englander said.
""We think that what has happened is that the threat of an immediate rupture has dropped out of asset market pricing. What is not getting priced in is the rising risk that we see a renewed USD upward trend.""
The New Zealand dollar kept its distance from six-year lows against the dollar after comments overnight by Prime Minister John Key gave the battered kiwi breathing space.
Although the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is still expected to cut rates when it meets Wednesday, Key's comments that the kiwi's 25 percent slide in the past year was faster than expected gave the market pause for thought.

The kiwi was up 0.4 percent at $0.6594 <NZD=D4> after touching $0.6498 last week, its lowest since July 2009.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0820 and 1.0871 before settling at 1.0814, down 0.0017 or 0.15%. The euro has now closed lower against its American counterpart on four of the last five session and six of the last eight. After peaking above 1.14 on June 22, the euro has lost approximately 5% against the dollar.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.707, the low from April 22 and was met with resistance at 1.1173, the high from July 1.
In Greece, banks throughout the country reopened after more than two weeks of closures. Greek customers still face strict capital controls, where they will be limited to withdrawals of EUR 60 a day and EUR 420 per week. The move coincided with a EUR 4.2 billion loan repayment Greece made to the European Central Bank on Monday, after the cash-strapped nation received bridge financing from its creditors of more than EUR 7 billion late last week.
Equities markets throughout Europe closed higher, as the potential for a Greek departure from the euro continued to recede. The STXE 6000 rose modestly by 0.35% to 407.12, while the Italian FTSE MIB surged 1.12% to 5,142.49.
The dollar, meanwhile, surged to three-month highs before retreating slightly just before the close. At one point, the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, reached an intraday high of 98.30, its highest level since April.
On Friday, strong U.S. inflation data bolstered the case for a 2015 interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. In a monthly report, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said its Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June rose by 0.3% on a monthly basis, in line with consensus estimates. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI gained 0.1% above analysts' forecasts for a flat reading.
A reading of Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, provided even more optimism for the hawks at the Fed in favor of a September rate hike. The core reading, which the Fed believes provides a more accurate gauge of inflation, rose 0.2% from May and 1.8% over the last 12 months. The U.S. central bank would like to see inflation move toward its targeted goal of 2% over a long-term basis before it raises its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Earlier last week, Fed chair Janet Yellen reiterated that conditions in the economy are likely to justify an interest rate hike at some point this year. Fed St. Louis president James Bullard appeased the hawks even further on Monday when he suggested that there is a 50% chance the FOMC will raise rates during its September meeting.
Yields on the U.S. 10-Year gained three basis points to 2.383 while yields on the U.S. 2-Year rose four basis points to 0.710."

The currency pair wavered between a low of 1.0828 and a peak of 1.0907 before settling at 1.0831, down 0.41% on the session. The euro ended the week down more than 2.7% against its American counterpart, after closing lower in four of the last five sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0818 the low from April 27 and was met with resistance at 1.1218, the high from July 10.
In Berlin, the German Bundestag approved a new series of Greek bailout negotiations in a 439-119 vote on Friday. Of the 119 no votes, 60 came from chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU voting bloc.
At the same time, the European Union approved €7.16 billion in short-term bridge financing to Greece that could allow banks throughout the nation to reopen next week.
""The loan will have a maximum maturity of three months and will be disbursed in up to two installments. It will allow Greece to clear its arrears with the IMF and the Bank of Greece and to repay the ECB, until Greece would start receiving financing under a new program from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM),"" the European Commission wrote in a statement.
The bridge financing opens the path for the two sides to resume negotiations on a bailout program that could provide Greece with up to €86 billion over a period of three years.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday morning that its Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in June on a monthly basis, in line with consensus estimates. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI gained 0.1% above analysts' forecasts for a flat reading.
A reading of Core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, provided even more optimism for the hawks at the Fed in favor of an imminent rate hike. The core reading, which the Fed believes provides a more accurate gauge of inflation, rose 0.2% from May and 1.8% over the last 12 months. Analysts expected gains of 0.1% and 1.7% respectively.
More critically, energy prices rose by 1.7% on the month on the back of a 3.4% increase in gasoline prices. Over the last few weeks, the Fed has strongly hinted that it could raise rates if it received indications that temporary drags from lower energy prices subsided. It has been nearly a decade since the U.S. Central Bank has hiked its benchmark Federal Funds Rate.

EUR/USD traded between a low of 1.0930 on the session and a peak of 1.1036, before settling at 1.0949, down 0.55% or 0.0060. The currency pair, which has closed lower in three of the last four sessions, fell to its lowest level in more than a week. At the midway point of July, the Euro is down more than 1.65% against its American counterpart for the month.
On Wednesday night, peaceful anti-austerity demonstrations in Athens quickly spun out of control as protestors lobbed dozens of Petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails at police in riot gear, who responded by spraying tear gas in their direction in an effort to subdue unruly crowds.
Debate continued into early Thursday morning inside Parliament, as a Midnight deal imposed by creditors during Monday's landmark deal passed. The creditors required the Greek Parliament to ratify four measures related to tax, pension and budget reforms in order to trigger a vote from six other national parliaments throughout the euro zone. While Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras will likely lose support from his leftist Syriza party after capitulating to euro zone creditors in Brussels, he is still expected to win enough votes needed to secure a three-year, EUR 86 billion bailout through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). 
On Thursday morning, euro group leaders have scheduled a conference call where they're expected to approve short-term bridge financing that could allow Greece meet billions in obligations to the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund in the coming weeks. The leaders are waiting for Parliamentary approval of the comprehensive deal before signing off on the short-term financing.
In the U.S., the dollar surged to its highest level in a week after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen sent strong indications that economic conditions are likely to justify an interest rate hike at some point this year.
In prepared remarks before Congress during her semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Yellen reiterated that the Federal Open Market Committee will likely raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate later this year if it continues to see improvements in the U.S economy and labor markets. The benchmark rate has remained at its current level of between zero and 0.25% since the end of the financial crisis. Meanwhile, more than eight years have passed since the Fed last instituted a rate hike.
""What matters for financial conditions and the broader economy is the entire expected path of interest rates, not any particular move, including the initial increase, in the federal funds rate,"" Yellen said. ""Indeed, the stance of monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the first increase in the federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.""
Following Yellen's comments the FOMC is widely expected to raise the Federal Funds Rate later this year during its September or December meeting. An earlier rate increase could correlate with a more gradual long-term rate path, while a delayed rate hike might force the Fed to accelerate the rate path, Yellen added.
""The entire path of rate increases does matter,"" Yellen said.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six major other currencies, surged more than 0.6% to a weekly high of 97.44 before falling slightly back to 97.27.

1029,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 15, 2015 10:24AM ET</span>",Forex - Canadian dollar falls to 6-year lows after BoC rate cut,"Investing.com - The Canadian dollar fell to six-year lows on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada cut its overnight rate and lowered its growth forecast for this year, largely due to a weaker outlook for business investment in the energy sector.
USD/CAD jumped 1.56% to 1.2926, the most since March 2009 from around 1.2787 ahead of the announcement.
The BoC lowered its target for the overnight rate to 0.5% from 0.75%.
The bank said global growth faltered in early 2015, principally in the U.S. and China. Slowing growth in China had pulled down commodity export prices, which are important to Canada’s economy.
Global economic growth is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year the bank said, but it revised down its estimate for Canadian economic growth from its April rate statement.
The bank said it now projected gross domestic product to have contracted modestly in the first half of the year, adding to downward pressure on inflation.
Canada’s economy is now expected to expand by just over 1% in 2015, down from 1.9% in April.
The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is also known, had weakened against the greenback earlier after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen reiterated that the bank is on track to raise interest rates later this year if the economy continues to evolve as expected.
Separately, reports showed that U.S. producer prices rose more than expected in June and factory activity in New York state rebounded this month.
The Department of Labor said the producer price index rose 0.4% in June, ahead of forecasts for a 0.2% increase. It was the second consecutive monthly increase.
Meanwhile, the New York Fed said its Empire State manufacturing index rose to 3.86 in July from minus 1.98 in June, which was its lowest level since January 2013.

The currency pair traded in a tight range between 1.0968 and 1.1083 before settling at 1.1010, up 0.25% for Tuesday's session. One session earlier, the euro plummeted more than 1.3% against its American counterpart after Greece secured a three-year, €86 billion bailout from its creditors in exchange for a swath of strict austerity measures. As tense negotiations reached its breaking point during acrimonious high-level discussions between the two sides over the last month, EUR/USD has declined by more than 2.2%.
The pair likely gained support at 1.0917, the low from July 7 and was met with resistance at 1.1411 the high from June 22.
In his first televised interview since Monday's landmark accord, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras told a Greek broadcasting network that the deal allows the nation to preserve its progressive values, while staving off bankruptcy. The agreement reached in the wee hours of Monday morning, came after Greek citizens rejected a proposal by a troika of its creditors in a sweeping referendum on July 5.
""I am not going to escape and I will take the responsibility even by signing an agreement I don't believe in,"" Tsipras said in an interview with Athens network ERT. ""We got an agreement with hard reforms but not the complete impasse of the 25th of June. Prior actions didn't change after the referendum, I must be honest about that. But we have a longer funding period and debt relief.""
Although a Greek departure from the euro appears unlikely following the developments over the last two days, Tsipras still did not rule one out.
""I cannot say anything with certainty before the deal finally signed,"" Tsipras added.
Tsipras continued to seek support from Parliament ahead of Wednesday's critical vote. The deal requires Parliament to ratify four measures related to tax, pension and budget reforms in order to trigger a vote from six other national parliaments throughout the euro zone.
Meanwhile, officials from the International Monetary Fund urged the euro zone to provide Greece with a more manageable debt sustainability program, by offering a 30-year grace period for the cash-strapped nation to repay its debts. While the European creditors are considering pushing back repayment dates and slashing interest rates on loans to Greece through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), euro zone officials have been reluctant to offer a haircut on its significant debt obligations.
In addition, IMF officials warned that Greece's debt level could reach 200% of its GDP in the near future if debt sustainability measures are not taken immediately.
""The dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date and what has been proposed by the ESM,"" the IMF said in a statement.
Investors also await the start of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's two-day testimony before Congress on Wednesday for further indications on the timing of a highly-anticipated interest rate hike. On Friday, Yellen said the Fed anticipates raising interest rates later this year if the U.S. economy and labor markets continue to show improvement in the coming weeks.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.0996 and 1.1197, before settling at 1.0999, marking the first time it closed under 1.10 over the last week. As investors worldwide have been on edge throughout this month in anticipation of a comprehensive deal, the euro has closed lower against the dollar in five of the last eight sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0917, the low from July 7 and was met with resistance at 1.1214, the high from July 10.
Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras returned to Athens on Monday after securing a possible bailout from international creditors during a grueling, often rancorous 17-hour emergency summit. Under Monday's deal, Greece agreed to a wide range of concessions on austerity measures that could pave the way for a three-year, €86 billion bailout through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The Greek parliament now has until Wednesday to pass four sweeping laws regarding sales tax increases, pension system overhauls and labor market reforms.
The ratification could trigger a vote by six other EU parliaments later this week. By July 22, the Greek parliament must pass two additional laws in order for talks to proceed. Greece must also open some of its businesses for Sunday trade and privatize its publicly-owned electricity transmission network operator, also known as ADMIE. 
""The Greeks have to move first, show that they're credible, that they mean it and at the end of the week we will take the form of a decision moving forward on the program,"" said Netherlands finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the euro group of finance ministers.
The austerity measures are considered stricter than the ones laid out in a proposal by euro zone leaders late last month, before they were rejected by Greece in a historic referendum on July 5. 
In Athens, Greek banks remained closed on Monday as the European Central Bank declined to raise the cap on emergency liquidity assistance to the institutions, which could have allowed them to reopen after two weeks of closures. While European Council president Donald Tusk said that the euro group would work on an arrangement that could provide Greece with bridge financing to meet its short-term obligations, there were no indications of an imminent deal on Monday evening. The majority of the 28 nations in the EU are expected to contribute to the bridging loans, which could provide Greece with €10 to 12 billion to help its banks avoid a shutdown. 
Greece owes a €3.5 billion loan repayment to the European Central Bank on July 20.
Tsipras may have won some concessions from creditors by insisting that a divisive €50 billion privatization fund remain in Athens. The proposed ""external and independent fund,"" created through a sell-off of Greek state-owned assets would be used to recapitalize banks, reduce Greek debt and pay for other investments. Tsipras' negotiating partners originally intended for the fund to be established in Luxembourg. 
Without a comprehensive deal, Greece faced the prospect of a default on its sovereign debt and a possible departure from the euro. 
""We faced tough decisions, tough dilemmas. The agreement calls for tough measures,"" Tsipras said in a statement. ""However, we prevented the transfer of public property abroad, we prevented the financial asphyxiation and the collapse of the financial system—this was planned to the last detail – having recently been designed to perfection, and in the process of being implemented."" 
Yields on government debt throughout the euro zone moved lower on Monday, as fears of contagion from a possible Greek exit receded. Yields on Portugal 10-Year bonds fell nine basis points to 2.73%, while yields on Italian and Spanish 10-Year each dipped by two basis points to 2.11 and 2.09% respectively.
In the U.S. investors await the start of Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's two-day testimony before Congress on Wednesday for further signals on the timing of a highly-anticipated interest rate hike. On Friday, Yellen indicated that the Fed could raise interest rates later this year if the U.S. economy and labor markets continue to show improvement in the coming weeks.

EUR/USD hit highs of 1.1197 and was last at 1.1178, up 0.17% for the day.
The euro was boosted after European officials said an agreement on a new aid program for Greece had been reached.
The details of the agreement were to be announced a press conference later in the day.
Greece accepted a series of draconian measures demanded by its creditors in exchange for a third bailout deal.
The Greek parliament must approve a package of reforms on Monday and then pass several pieces of legislation by Wednesday, including on pensions reform and a new sales tax regime, before the euro zone will agree to negotiate a new three-year rescue package.
Greece had initially resisted two key demands from creditors on having the International Monetary Fund involved in the new bailout, and on a German demand for Greece to set aside €50 billion of state assets to act as collateral for fresh loans.
The euro also edged higher against the yen, with EUR/JPY touching highs of 137.79, before pulling back to 136.99.
The dollar also hit session highs against the safe haven yen, with USD/JPY rising to 123.09.

The weekend talks, which were supposed to be the final deadline for a deal, on late Sunday were divided on the way forward, according to reports.
Greece may get €7 billion in ""bridge"" finance before July 20 to enable it to make payments and keep the banking system afloat while parliament passes a long list of tough reforms, EU sources said of the most promising effort so far in last-minute talks on Sunday to secure a deal.
According to an assessment drafted by the Eurogroup and provided to euro zone leaders in Brussels on Sunday, Greece needs a total of €7 billion before July 20 to cover its financing needs, with €3.5 billion of that amount being owed to the European Central Bank.
Leaders are discussing using a mixture of €1.9 billion still owed to Greece from profits the ECB made as part of its securities markets program as well as a potential cash disbursement from €13 billion still lying dormant inside the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, an old bailout fund created in 2010 to provide financial assistance to EU member states.
A qualified majority inside the ECOFIN Council, which means 16 out of 28 countries, would have to vote in favor of it, according to reports.

Hopes for a breakthrough were boosted after Greece put forward new proposals on budget cuts and economic reforms ahead of a meeting of the euro group of finance ministers on Saturday.
The yen had strengthened broadly earlier in the week as the deteriorating situation in Greece and a rout in Chinese equity markets bolstered safe haven inflows.

All eyes are now on a summit of European leaders on Sunday, in what could be Greece's final opportunity to avoid a default.
The virtual currency has been well supported by safe-haven demand in recent weeks, as it is one of the few asset classes that can act as a hedge against fiat currency fluctuation.

The pair soared to a session-high of 1.1214, moving above 1.12 for the first time in July, before falling back slightly to 1.1148. After opening at 1.0996 on Monday, the euro gained roughly 1.5% against the dollar on the week.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0994, the low from July 6 and was met with resistance at 1.1411, the high from June 22.
Legislators braced for a long, fatiguing night in Athens as the Greek parliament sent indications that a vote on prime minister Alexis Tsipras' latest bailout proposal could come as late as 6 a.m. on Saturday morning. Debate on a critical stimulus package, which could enable Greece to remain in the euro zone, began shortly after midnight Athens time.
Tsipras submitted the proposal to Greece's troika of international creditors from the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission on Thursday night three hours before a midnight deadline. Under a proposed deal, Greece could receive a EUR 53.5 billion stimulus package through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
""We are confronted with crucial decisions,"" Tsipras said. ""We got a mandate to bring a better deal than the ultimatum that the Euro group gave us, but certainly not given a mandate to take Greece out of the euro zone. We are all in this together.”
Addressing the Greek parliament on Friday evening, Greece finance minister Euclid Tsakalatos outlined a proposal which includes an ESM-ECB debt swap, significant fiscal and investment reforms and further debt relief as part of the program. On Saturday, the euro group of finance ministers will discuss the request by the Greek authorities for financial assistance from the ESM, while the three institutions will present their assessment of risk to financial stability in the euro area, Greece’s financing needs and the sustainability of its public debt, the euro group said in a statement.
If approved, the two sides could approve an agreement on Sunday in an emergency summit in Brussels.
Elsewhere, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reaffirmed that the U.S. central bank is on track to raise interest rates at some point this year. Speaking at a luncheon at The City Club in Cleveland, Yellen downplayed the importance of the Fed's first rate hike in more than a decade, preferring to focus on the gradual pace of policy normalization on a longer-term basis.
""I want to emphasize while there is a lot of public discussion on that first move we should not over emphasize the timing of that first move,"" Yellen said. ""What is really going to matter is the entire path of interest rates over time. My own view is that the headwinds that have been holding back recovery for all these years are receding and conditions are improving.""

Overnight, the dollar remained broadly higher against a basket of other major currencies on Thursday, even after data showed that U.S. jobless claims rose to their highest level since February last week as markets were jittery ahead of fresh reform proposals from Greece.
On Thursday evening, Greece presented a signed copy of an emergency bailout to its troika of creditors three hours before the expiration of a midnight deadline. Under the new proposal, Greece agreed to a strict package of reforms and spending cuts worth up to €13 billion, according to the Guardian.
In exchange for the adoption of the austerity measures, the cash-strapped nation could receive approximately €50 billion in short-term funding needed to stave off bankruptcy. The proposal reportedly also includes modest debt-relief for the Mediterranean state, ahead of key repayments owed to the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund over the next several weeks.
European council president Donald Tusk has advocated for the inclusion of debt sustainability as a provision of the agreement.
The Greek Parliament is expected to approve the proposal on Friday before prime minister Alexis Tsipras heads to Brussels for an emergency summit over the weekend. Tsipras has also called for a meeting of Syriza party lawmakers at 0600 BST on Friday. Officials from the ECB, IMF and European Commission will now assess the revised plan ahead of the extraordinary summit.
During a frenzied week, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly insisted that a haircut or write-off on Greece's substantial debt obligations should remain off the negotiating table. Meanwhile, Tsipras communicated over the phone with U.S. president Barack Obama earlier in the week in an effort to convince Merkel and other top leaders from the euro zone to work feverishly to reach a deal.

In Athens, newly appointed Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos outlined a comprehensive set of reforms the nation would adhere to in exchange for a three-year bailout through the European Stability Mechanism. The proposal includes: tax-related reforms, pension-related measures and potential debt relief. Tsakalotos is set to explain the proposal in greater detail on Thursday.
""Greece welcomes an opportunity to explore potential measures to be taken so that its official sector related debt becomes both sustainable and viable over the long term,"" Tsakalotos said. 
Tsakalotos indicated that the release will provide officials from the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission with ample time to review the proposal before Sunday's emergency summit between Greece and its creditors in Brussels. While the meeting is viewed by many European officials as Greece's last opportunity to remain in the euro, it will come eight days before the cash-strapped nation owes a loan repayment of €3.5 billion to the ECB.
""The stark reality is that we have only five days left,"" European Council president Donald Tusk said in a news conference on Tuesday night. ""Until now I have avoided talking about deadlines, but tonight I have to say loud and clear that the final deadline ends this week.""
When the Fed released the minutes from its FOMC June meeting on Wednesday afternoon, they showed that the U.S. central bank appeared concerned last month that there would not be a deal between Greece and its creditors at the time of the meeting. Expressing worries that the Greek issues could spill over into European markets and U.S. financial markets, the Fed opted to take a cautious approach on the timing of its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade.
In addition, the FOMC said it would like to see additional evidence that the U.S. economy and labor markets are improving, as well as indications that inflation is moving toward its long-term targeted goal of 2% before it raises its benchmark Federal Funds rate.
“While participants generally saw the risks to their projections of economic activity and the labor market as balanced, they gave a number of reasons to be cautious in assessing the outlook,” the minutes said.
Yields on Italian and Spanish 10-Year bonds were relatively flat, falling four and five basis points to 2.21 and 2.22% respectively. The lack of movement may ease fears of the effects of contagion if Greece leaves the euro.

Greece has a five-day deadline to submit a detailed package of reforms to international creditors in return for a bailout or risk the ""bankruptcy"" of both the country and its financial system, European Council President Donald Tusk and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned Tuesday.
In a high-stakes atmosphere that followed a meeting of euro zone leaders in Brussels after Greece's Sunday austerity referendum, Tusk and Juncker did not mince words.
""The stark reality is that we have only five days left to find an ultimate agreement,"" Tusk said. ""Until now I've avoided talking about deadlines, but tonight I have to say it loud and clear: the final deadline ends this week.""
""If there's no deal, it will mean all the possible consequences, including the worst-case scenario, where all of us will lose,"" Tusk continued. ""Failure to find an agreement will lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system.""
A Eurogroup meeting would be arranged for Saturday, Tusk said, followed by an extraordinary meeting of all twenty-eight European Union leaders on Sunday.
A visibly angry Juncker then rounded on recent comments from the Syriza government in Greece and, in particular, its former finance minister Yannis Varoufakis, who referred to European creditors as ""terrorists"" in the run-up to Sunday's plebiscite.
""With respect to the dignity of Greek people, I must say that I strongly object the accusations thrown to the Greek public in the referendum campaign that we are terrorists,"" Juncker said ""Who are they and who do you think I am?""
Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, told reporters that his country's rescue plan includes ""credible reforms that aim for social justice"" that will be met by creditors with ""medium term financing commitments, a strong investment plan to combat unemployment and to start a meaningful talk for the debt restructuring.""
""The procedure is quick in order to reach a deal by the end of the week,"" he said. ""Everyone understands that this is not a Greek problem but a European one.""

On Tuesday night in Brussels, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras proposed a two-pronged plan to top euro group leaders aimed at helping the beleaguered state avoid bankruptcy. The short-term portion of the proposal includes a three to four month bailout that could allow Greek banks to remain open and allow Tsipras' government to repay debts to the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. It would then be followed by a two-year bailout, which would include significant debt relief from the nation's troika of creditors.
Following the emergency meeting, EUR/USD rose sharply to 1.1002 to end the session down 0.0053 or 0.48%. Earlier, the currency pair plunged to a four-week low at 1.0917, as hopes for an imminent deal appeared slim. For the session, EUR/USD traded between a low of 1.0917 and a peak of 1.1060. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0867, the low from May 28 and was met with resistance at 1.1350 the high from June 21.
Germany chancellor Angela Merkel issued a stark warning on Tuesday that Greece only had a matter of days to strike a new deal after its second bailout expired early last week. Over the weekend, Greek voters emphatically rejected the euro zone's latest cash-for-reforms deal in a historic referendum. Tsipras also spoke over the phone with U.S. president Barack Obama before Tuesday's critical summit in an effort to pressure Germany to ease some of the strict austerity measures deemed necessary to reach an accord. In recent days, the White House has urged leaders from the euro zone to work collaboratively in order to prevent a Greek default and subsequent departure from the area. 
Greece is likely to lose access to emergency aid from the European Central Bank if it is unable to meet a €3.5 billion obligation on July 20. Without the emergency liquidity assistance from the ECB, Greek banks throughout the nation could become insolvent in a matter of days.

Currency traders now await Tuesday's critical emergency summit in Brussels between Greece and its European creditors for further indications on the likelihood of a Greek bailout. A host of emergency meetings involving high-level officials from the European Central Bank, European Commission and euro zone group of finance ministers has accomplished little headway in recent weeks.
On Monday, EUR/USD traded between 1.0994 and 1.1115, before settling at 1.1056 at the conclusion of the session, down by 0.50%. The euro is now down against its American counterpart by 0.42% over the last month of trading.

It came less than 24 hours after Greek citizens turned down a closely watched referendum, which could have lent support to a cash-for-reforms deal proposed by leaders from the euro zone and may have led to the resignation of prime minister Alexis Tsipras. In a sweeping vote over the weekend, the Greek people rejected the referendum by a 61.3% to 38.7% margin.
Also, the Greek government announced that Euclid Tsakalotos will be sworn in as the nation's next finance minister on Monday evening following the resignation of Yanis Varoufakis earlier in the day. Tsakalotos, an Oxford-educated economist, will represent Greece in a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels.
Meanwhile, Germany vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel indicated that Greece is teetering on insolvency and must present an offer beyond the measures it has proposed in recent weeks if it hopes to reach a deal. Greece's latest proposal could be modeled on the latest offer crafted by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, according to multiple reports.
Elsewhere, the International Monetary Fund sent indications that it may lend financial support and debt relief to Greece if Tsipras' government is willing to enact the austerity measures needed to appease its creditors. Last week, Greece became the first advanced nation in more than 70 years to default on a loan repayment to the IMF.
""The IMF has taken note of yesterday's referendum held in Greece,"" IMF head Christine Lagarde said in a statement. ""We are monitoring the situation closely and stand ready to assist Greece if requested to do so.""

1135,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2015 05:15PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ends week with rally as Greece, Fed rate hike continue to weigh","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rallied on Thursday amid a weaker than expected U.S. jobs report for June, as a highly anticipated Greek referendum this weekend remained in focus.
The currency pair wavered between 1.1033 and 1.1121 in Thursday's session, before falling back slightly to 1.1086 at the close, gaining 0.0033 or 0.30% on the final day of trading this week. EUR/USD posted modest gains on the week after opening on Monday just above 1.10.
The pair likely gained support at 1.0953, the low from June 29 and was met with resistance at 1.1411, the high from June 22.
On Thursday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said non-farm payrolls in June rose by 223,000, slightly lower than consensus estimates from economists of a 230,000 gain. The slight pullback comes a month after a robust report in May when the economy added 280,000 non-farm jobs. The Labor Department also revised the May figure downward on Thursday by 26,000 to 254,000.
Average hourly wages also remained flat on a month to month basis, one month after surging 0.3% in May. Analysts forecasted a 0.2% increase in wages for June. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, ticked down to 5.3% slightly above consensus forecasts for a 0.1% decline to 5.4%. In May, the unemployment rate inched up by 0.1% to 5.5%.
The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader gauge of the employment outlook throughout the U.S., fell 0.3% to 10.5%. The rate measures the total level of unemployment in the labor market along with the rate of marginally attached workers, as well as the level of part-time workers in the workforce. Marginally attached workers are defined as people currently without jobs, who are not currently looking for work but have sought employment in the last 12 months. The U-6 rate is a measure preferred by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, as she weighs the strength of the labor market.
The relatively benign employment report could convince dovish policymakers at the Fed to delay the timing of a highly anticipated interest rate hike beyond September. Last month, Yellen reiterated that the Fed would like to see continued improvement in GDP, wage and inflationary growth before it lifts short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
While there were few developments in the contentious Greek Debt negotiations on Thursday, the International Monetary Fund cast a dark pall over the ongoing crisis with a stark warning on the long-term economic outlook in Greece. As Greek citizens consider a controversial referendum on Sunday, which may determine the nation's status in the euro zone, the IMF said the cash-strapped nation needs €50 billion and significant debt relief to make it through 2018. Earlier in the week, Greece became the first advanced nation in more than 70 years to default on a loan to the IMF.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.25% to 96.27 amid a wave of downbeat U.S. economic data. USD/CAD dipped 0.38% to 1.2543, falling off two and a half month highs."

Hopes for a last minute deal between Greece and the euro zone were quashed on Wednesday after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras urged voters to reject the terms of an international bailout deal.
Greek voters are due to decide on Sunday whether to accept terms proposed by the institutions overseeing the country’s now-expired bailout, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission, or reject them.
Tsipras has said a vote against the proposals would give him a stronger mandate to agree a third bailout Greece’s creditors. However, European leaders have said the referendum is ultimately a vote on whether to remain in the euro zone.
Greece became the first developed country to default on the IMF after its second bailout program expired late Tuesday.
The ECB maintained its limits on emergency liquidity for Greek banks on Wednesday and also made no changes to the amount of collateral banks must post to obtain the funding.
The default by Greece has added to fears over the country’s solvency and fueled doubts over the condition of Greek banks and the collateral they use for ECB loans.

1147,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 01, 2015 05:34PM ET</span>","EUR/USD continues slump, as investors await weekend Greek referendum","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell sharply extending losses from one session, as optimism for a deal in prolonged Greek Debt negotiations faded after a defiant address by prime minister Alexis Tsipras to Greek citizens on Wednesday evening.
The currency pair traded between 1.1043 and 1.1171 on Wednesday before settling at 1.1053, down 0.77%. Although EUR/USD has closed lower in five of the last six sessions, it spiked more than 2.3% on Monday in one of its highest one-day moves in months.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0991, the low from June 1 and was met with resistance at 1.1348, the high from June 23.
In Athens, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted that a no vote by Greek citizens in Sunday's highly anticipated referendum does not signal a departure from the euro zone, rather a denunciation of strict austerity measures its international creditors have demanded in return for cash and a potential restructuring of its debt.
""No does not mean breaking with Europe, but returning to the Europe of values,"" Tsipras said in the address to the nation. ""No means strong pressure a socially just agreement that puts burden on those who can shoulder it and not on pensioners and workers once again.""
A day earlier as Greece's second bailout expired, Tsipras' government submitted a revised proposal, which included: pension, tax and labor reforms, as well as enhanced fiscal structural measures.
A bevy of Greece's international creditors, meanwhile, remain adamant that a No vote on Sunday will provide an indication of the Mediterranean state's intention of leaving the euro zone. Netherlands finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro group of finance ministers, said Wednesday that no deal will be completed until after the referendum.
Elsewhere, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday evening that she is unclear where Greek negotiations stand, one day after the Mediterranean state became the first advanced nation to default on a payment to the organization. Speaking exclusively to Reuters, Lagarde added that she hopes the referendum provides more clarity, certainty about the situation.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.57% to 96.30 amid a wave of strong economic data. The dollar has appreciated sharply in three of the last four sessions as it nears a three-week high.
When the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly jobs report on Thursday, economists expect a consensus rise of 230,000 non-farm payrolls for the month of June. In a robust report in May, non-farm payrolls surged by 280,000, amid significant increases in professional business services, retail trade and trade and transportation.
Analysts also expect the unemployment rate to tick down 0.1% to 5.4% after edging up to 5.5% in May. In terms of hourly wages, economists anticipate an uptick of 0.2% in June building on a 0.3% surge a month earlier.
A strong employment report could appease the hawks at the Federal Reserve, who are in favor of a September interest rate hike. Following last month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated that the U.S. Central Bank would like to see continued improvement in wage and inflation growth before it raises its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nearly a decade.

1160,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 30, 2015 05:44PM ET</span>","EUR/USD moves lower, as Greek bailout and IMF deadline expire","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell considerably on Tuesday one session after enjoying one of its highest one-day moves of the year, as the drama surrounding the Greek Debt Crisis continued.
After surging more than 2.3% on Monday during a choppy day of trading, EUR/USD dipped 0.82% to 1.1144, as currency traders kept a close eye on negotiations between Greece and its international creditors. For the month, the currency pair gained more than 1.5% after opening June below 1.10.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1048, the low from June 5 and was met with resistance at 1.1438, the high from June 18.
An emergency conference call between Greece and its euro zone creditors ended on Tuesday night without a deal in the tense, longstanding negotiations. As a result, a €240 billion stimulus program, Greece's second bailout since 2010, expired as expected. Netherlands finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro group of finance ministers, said on Tuesday evening that negotiations will continue on Wednesday.
Separately, Greece failed to make a €1.5 billion repayment to the IMF stemming from a 2010 bailout, before the end of Tuesday's deadline. Greece joins Zimbabwe, Sudan, Somalia and Liberia as the only nations with overdue repayments to the IMF over the last decade.
While Greece will become the first advanced economy in the 71-year history of the IMF to be placed in arrears, its failure to meet the obligation on time will not yet result in full default on its sovereign debt. If Greece remains in arrears only for a short period of time, there is a possibility the IMF will show leniency to the Mediterranean state once it repays its debts. Any nation in arrears with the IMF, which occurs when a debt or liability is overdue, is unable to receive access to the organization's resources until the debts are settled.
Earlier, Greece proposed a two-year bailout program under the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone's bailout fund. The proposal comes days after the Greek parliament approved a public referendum on July 5, which is largely viewed as a proxy on whether its citizens would like to remain in the euro zone.
“From the first moment, we made clear that the decision to hold a referendum is not the end but the continuation of negotiations for better terms for the Greek people,"" the Greek government said in a statement. ""The Greek government will until the end seek a viable agreement within the euro.”
Germany chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, remained adamant that no bailout discussions should be held between the two sides until after the referendum is completed.
Yields on Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds fell five and six basis points each to 2.29% and 2.33% respectively, quelling fears of contagion in Europe if Greece leaves the area. A spike in bond yields could provide signals that a Greek departure might trigger a downturn among a number of economies throughout the zone.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged 0.81% to 95.71. USD/JPY fell 0.07% to 122.46, while USD/CAD rose 0.71% to 1.249."

1173,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2015 05:43PM ET</span>","EUR/USD reverses territory surging nearly 2.5%, as Greek drama escalates","Investing.com -- EUR/USD took currency traders on a wild rollercoaster ride on Monday, dipping below 1.10 in overnight before rebounding sharply as Greece moved closer to a default on its sovereign debt and a subsequent exit from the euro zone.
Following hours of frenetic, unpredictable trading, EUR/USD settled at 1.1242 up more than 2.4%. The rally marked the highest one-day move by the euro against its American counterpart in more than two and a half months. The currency pair traded in a broad range, falling to a near monthly-low of 1.0976 before skyrocketing to a session-high of 1.1278.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0886 the low from June 1 and was met with resistance at 1.1411, the high from June 22.
Less than 48 hours after the Greek parliament approved a July 5 referendum that could decide the nation's fate in the euro zone, Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece's credit to a CCC- from a previous rating of CCC. Unless Greece improves its economic outlook immeasurably, S&P indicated the nation is inevitably headed toward a default, adding that there is a 50-50 chance the nation will leave the euro.
In Athens, officials announced that banks will remain closed until Thursday after the Greece government imposed a set of capital controls on Sunday aimed at preventing a bank run. On Sunday night queues multiplied outside a host of Greek banks in Athens, hours before the government imposed a law limiting citizens to ATM deposits of €60 a day. Earlier in the day, the European Central Bank capped funding from its Emergency Liquidity Assistance fund to Greek banks at €89 billion in a move that forced the Greek government to close the banks. The banks had been borrowing money from the emergency fund to cover a high volume of deposit withdrawals in recent weeks.
Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras surprisingly scheduled a public referendum on early Sunday morning after high-level talks with its international creditors fell apart on Friday. Before talks collapsed, the creditors reportedly offered Greece a €15.5 billion cash-for-reforms package, which included significant pension reforms and hikes on Value Added Taxes. The package reportedly would have allowed Greece to cover its debts through November. A yes vote in Sunday's referendum could compel Greece to return to the negotiating table with its troika of creditors from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and the EU.
Tsipras appeared confident that European officials would not remove Greece from the euro zone even if Greek voters rejected the current proposal in a no vote on Sunday.
""Let me be frank they will not kick us out of the euro zone,"" Tsipras said in an interview with Greek State TV. ""Let me explain why, the costs are immense. Their plan is not to kick us out of the euro zone, their plan is to end hope that in Europe there can be an alternative policy.""
Germany chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, reiterated on Monday the importance of holding the euro together if Greece leaves the area, while adding that the euro zone is in better position to cope with contagion than it had been during a previous Greek debt crisis several years earlier.
Bond prices jumped upon the developments, as yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries plummeted 15 basis points to 2.32%. Yields on German 10-Year bunds dipped 13 basis points to 0.79%."

EUR/USD hit lows of 1.0953, the weakest since June 2 and was last at 1.1076, off 0.78% for the day.
Greece’s bailout is due to expire on Tuesday, the same day that Athens is due to repay €1.6 billion to the IMF, but without a rescue package in place Greece will almost certainly default.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras abandoned negotiations with creditors on Saturday and called for a referendum to be held on July 5 on the terms proposed by lenders for extending the country’s bailout.
European finance ministers refused a request from the Greek government to extend the bailout program until after the referendum.
The European Central Bank said Sunday it will continue providing emergency liquidity assistance to Greece’s banks, but capped emergency funding at current levels. 
The ECB said it was monitoring the situation and stood ready ""to reconsider its decision.""
A Greek official said Monday that banks would remain closed for six days starting on Monday to avert a crisis in the banking sector after deposit outflows accelerated over the weekend. Withdrawals at ATM machines were to be limited to €60 a day per account.

The currency pair traded between 1.1131 and 1.1220 during Friday's session, paring earlier losses in U.S. afternoon trading. For the week, the euro closed lower against its American counterpart on four of five sessions losing 1.75% during the stretch. At one point on Monday EUR/USD moved above 1.14, before plunging on Tuesday below 1.12 during one of its worst sessions of the year. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1080, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at 1.1438, the high from June 18.
Following two days of intense, high-level talks in Brussels, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras was scheduled to return to Athens on Friday to discuss a revised proposal with members of his cabinet and parliament. The new proposal from Athens’ international creditors includes the release of €15.5 billion of frozen aid in four installments, a package that could allow Greece to meet its debt obligations to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank through November. In exchange, the proposal requires Greece to enact significant pension and tax reforms that the cash-strapped nation has resisted for months. European Commissioner president Jean-Claude Juncker and Tsipras met well into Thursday evening in an effort to hash out the critical issues. 
The euro group of finance ministers is set to meet again on Saturday afternoon, where Greece will be asked whether it will accept a revised deal from its troika of creditors from the IMF, ECB and European Commission. If Athens declines the proposal, the group will then concentrate its efforts on limiting the consequences of a Greek default on its sovereign debt. 
On Tuesday, the final €7.2 billion of a €240 bailout to Greece will expire if the two sides cannot reach a deal. Greece is also facing a deadline on Tuesday to meet a bundled €1.5 billion loan repayment to the IMF stemming from a separate bailout program in 2010. It is unlikely Greece will be able to make the payment without a last-minute deal. 
In the U.S., the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index surged to 96.1 for June, well above the high end of analysts’ forecasts for a reading of 95.2. The 13.1 gain since a reading from late-March represents the survey’s highest monthly gain since March, 1991. It also comes one day after the U.S. Department of Commerce said consumer spending surged 0.9% on a monthly basis in May, bolstered by a 0.5% uptick in personal income. 
The news pushed U.S. government bond prices lower, as yields on 10-Year Treasuries soared more than eight basis points to 2.48%, their highest level since late-September. Yields on German 10-Year bunds rose six basis points to 0.92%. They are now up 38 basis points on the month.

EUR/USD lost 0.001 or 0.02% to 1.1205, moving lower for the third time in four sessions. The euro is on pace to close the week down more than 1.3% against the dollar, after suffering one of its worst one-day declines of the year on Tuesday. In Thursday's session, the currency pair traded in a range of 1.1154 and 1.1227.

EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1078, the low from June 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1411, the high from June 22.

In Brussels, the two sides in longstanding Greek Debt negotiations concluded talks on Thursday without reaching a deal. During the emergency two-day meeting, both sides presented revised proposals that could unlock critical stimulus aid to Greece thought to be necessary in order to avoid bankruptcy. The high-level talks included members of the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission.

The emergency negotiations could resume on Saturday, The Guardian reported.

“We shall continue our deliberations, the institutions are going to look again at the two documents - our documents and their own, there will be discussions with the Greek government, and we’ll continue until we find a solution,” Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis told reporters in Brussels.

The developments on Thursday had little impact on stocks in Greek banks. Greece is running out of time before it owes the IMF a bundled payment of EUR 1.5 billion on Tuesday.

Yields on Greek 10-Year bonds jumped 11 basis points to 10.51% following the subdued headlines. For the year, the government bond yields have surged 510 basis points. Yields on Germany 10-Year bunds rose two basis to 0.86%, while yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries gained four basis points to 2.41%, as the spread between the debt instruments slightly widened.

Also on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Commerce said consumer spending surged in May by 0.9%, the highest monthly gain in nearly six years and above expectations for a 0.7% rise. Bolstered by a 0.5% spike in personal income, the surge reflects an increase in consumer spending in auto purchases and retail goods. Consumer spending accounts for approximately two-thirds of economic activity throughout the U.S.

At the same time, the Commerce Department said its  PCE price index rose by 0.3% for the month in line with consensus estimates from analysts. The index is up by 0.2% on a year-over-year basis. The Core PCE price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inched up 0.1% from April. Over the last 12 months, however, the index is up 1.2%.

Last week, the Fed reiterated that it would like to see inflation move toward its long-term targeted goal of 2% before it institutes its first interest rate hike in more than a decade.

The The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, ticked down 0.05% to 95.37. USD/JPY fell 0.16% to 123.65, moving lower for the second straight session. USD/CAD dropped 0.43% to 1.2329, paring most of Wednesday's gains."

USD/CHF was up 0.57% to 9389 following the remarks from around 0.9345 earlier, while EUR/CHF was at 1.0511 from 1.0475 beforehand.
The drop in the Swissy came after the SNB chairman warned that it is “considerably overvalued” and added that the bank will continue to weaken it by intervening in currency markets and maintaining negative benchmark interest rates and negative rates on franc deposits.
""The global economy has been in a nearly permanent state of crisis for almost eight years,"" Jordan said. ""The pressure on the franc is the mirror image of this.""
The comments came during a speech in Lausanne.
The Swiss franc is seen as a safe haven investment because of Switzerland's current account surplus, which means it’s not reliant on foreign investment to fund its budget.
Last week the SNB maintained its rate on sight deposits at minus 0.75% and left the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at between minus 1.25% and minus 0.25%.
Negative rates effectively mean banks are paying the central bank to hold their money.

1212,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2015 06:06PM ET</span>","EUR/USD returns above 1.12, as Greek talks in Brussels sputter","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose modestly to rally from sharp losses one session earlier, as emergency meetings in Brussels regarding the Greek Debt negotiations yielded little meaningful outcomes.
After tumbling more than 1.5% on Tuesday in one of its sharpest one-day losses of the year, the euro recovered in Wednesday's session gaining 0.28% to 1.1201. The currency pair wavered between 1.1160 and 1.1235, as currency traders kept a watchful eye on the start of an emergency two-day meeting of euro zone finance ministers.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1080, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at 1.1438, the high from June 18.
Although talks between the group of finance ministers was expected to persist well into Wednesday night or even Thursday morning, the discussions broke off quickly, lasting less than an hour before the group could draft a staff-level agreement. While technical talks between Greece with officials from the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund lasted longer, the two sides still were reportedly unable to bridge vast gaps on differences in pension, tax and financing issues. The sides are expected to reconvene on Thursday.
Any optimism for a deal on Wednesday that could unlock a critical stimulus package for Greece quickly faded amid growing contention between the IMF and the cash-strapped nation. A five-page document leaked by the IMF outlined broad proposals for Athens to enact sweeping pension reforms and measures aimed at generating additional revenue from Value-Added Taxes.
Before arriving in Brussels for high-level negotiations with officials from the European Central Bank and the IMF, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras criticized international creditors for its perceived unfair treatment of the Mediterranean state in comparison with other European nations under economic duress in the recent past.
""The repeated rejection of equivalent measures by certain institutions never occurred before-neither in Ireland nor Portugal,"" Tsipras wrote on his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account. ""This odd stance seems to indicate that either there is no interest in an agreement or that special interests are being backed.""
Greece is running short on time before a bundled payment of € 1.5 billion is due to the IMF on June 30. It is feared Tsipras' nation could leave the euro zone if it defaults on its sovereign debt, triggering potential contagion throughout the area.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis upgraded its estimate of GDP growth for the first quarter from an initial projection of negative 0.7%, but still projected negative growth for the period at an annual rate of 0.2%. The decrease in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected negative contributions from exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending, the BEA said in a statement.
The downside pressures were partially offset by positive contributions from Price Consumption Expenditures, private inventory investment, and residential fixed investment. GDP growth is typically slow in the first quarter due to seasonal factors. In the opening quarter of 2014, the U.S. economy experienced even sharper losses as GDP declined by more than 2%. Advanced estimates for second quarter GDP will be released on July, where analysts anticipate growth of 2-3% during the period.

1237,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 22, 2015 05:45PM ET</span>",EUR/USD falls slightly in spite of significant progress in Greek talks,"Investing.com -- The euro fell slightly against the dollar on Monday on a day of choppy trading, in spite of the clearest indication in months of an imminent deal in the plodding, drawn out Greek Debt negotiations.
EUR/USD closed Monday's session down 0.0026 or 0.24% to 1.1334, as Monday's emergency summit of European Union leaders concluded in Brussels. The currency pair fluctuated between 1.1313 and 1.1410 on the first day of trading this week. Since spiking more than 1.7% on June 8, EUR/USD has remained relatively stable closing less than 1% in a positive or negative direction on 12 consecutive sessions.
The pair likely gained support on Monday at 1.1080, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at 1.1438, the high from June 18.
In Brussels, Greece presented a broad, comprehensive proposal to its international creditors, which reportedly included plans to raise the nation's retirement age to 67 and impose increases to Value Added Taxes on electricity. In addition, Greece reportedly moved closer to agreeing to creditors' demands for a target budget surplus of 1% for this year, 2% next year and up to 3% in 2017, BBC reported.
Giorgos Stathakis, Greece's economy minister, also told the BBC that his nation's new proposal includes: a new corporate tax, a new tax on the wealthy and some other increases on VAT taxes. The developments stoked optimism among participants that a deal could be reached at a potential euro group meeting on Thursday.
""We will work very hard in the next few days, the institutions with the Greek government, to get that deal this week,"" said Netherlands finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the euro group of finance ministers.
Reports also indicate that any potential deal will not include debt relief for Greece, as well as comprehensive pension cuts. Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras held a series of talks with a host of European Union leaders, as well as European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde before Monday night's emergency summit.
A temporary deal could unlock critical aid deemed necessary for Greece to stave off bankruptcy ahead of a EUR 1.5 loan repayment due to the IMF on June 30. At the same time, the final €7.2 billion tranche of a €240 billion bailout could expire if Greece doesn't reach an accord by the end of the month.
Stocks throughout Europe rose sharply on Monday in response to the encouraging reports. The German Dax index closed up nearly 4%, while a host of Italian banks ended Monday up 5% on the session. Italy could be threatened by contagion throughout the euro zone if Greece defaults on its debt and leaves the euro.
News of a potential breakthrough also spilled over into the U.S. markets, as stocks on the major indices all closed up by more than 0.5%. The NASDAQ Composite index continued its recent surge, jumping 36.97 or 0.72% to 5,153.97.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries soared 11 basis points to 2.37%, but the spread between U.S. and German 10-year bonds condensed, as yields on German bunds jumped 13 basis points to 0.88.

One day after high-level talks in Luxembourg broke-off without a deal in the five-month long Greek debt negotiations, the European Central Bank reportedly increased the cap on its Emergency Liquidity Assistance fund for banks in Greece by €3.3 billion. It came days after depositors took out a reported €2.0 billion from Greek banks in a 72-hour period, underscoring their lack of trust in the teetering economy.
Greece is running out of time before it owes the International Monetary Fund a bundled loan payment of EUR 1.5 billion on June 30. At the same time, the remaining €7.2 billion of a €240 billion stimulus package from its international creditors is set to expire at the month.
On Monday, all 27 members of the European Union are scheduled to be present at an emergency summit in what could be Greece's final opportunity to avoid a default.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Germany chancellor Angela Merkel said it isn't too late for Greece to complete a deal as long as it agrees to the reforms required.
Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco president John Williams reiterated on Friday that an interest rate hike could be appropriate in 2015, while adding that waiting too long for lift-off poses added risk.

1267,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2015 05:49PM ET</span>","EUR/USD pairs gains after reaching monthly-high, amid Greek uncertainty","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose mildly on Thursday paring earlier gains in the morning session when it surged to one-month highs, amid mixed developments in the Greek Debt negotiations.
Earlier, the euro surged to a session-high of 1.1436 against the dollar, moving above 1.14 for the first time since May 18. But the currency pair retreated on Thursday afternoon, as a tense meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg ended without a deal between Greece and its international creditors. An accord between the cash-strapped nation and the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund could unlock critical aid deemed necessary to stave off bankruptcy.
Upon the conclusion of Thursday's meeting, Reuters reported that European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure told Netherlands finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem that he is unsure if banks in Greece will remain open by Monday if a deal is not reached. Earlier this week, more than €2 billion in deposits had been taken out of banks throughout Greece, underscoring the increased potential of a Greek default on its sovereign debt.
Before the start of the meeting, German newspaper Die Zeit reported that the euro zone had proposed an interim deal to Greece, which would provide it with €10 billion in cash – enough of a sum to recapitalize its banks.
Euro zone officials neither confirmed, nor denied the reports following Thursday's meeting. The ECB is also reportedly set to decide by Friday whether it will provide added liquidity to the Greek banks to help stem the outflow of deposits. Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and France president Francois Hollande agreed to hold an emergency EU meeting on Monday in a last-ditch attempt for Greece to avoid bankruptcy.
International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde warned that Greece will not be given a grace period if it fails to make a loan repayment of €1.5 billion on June 30.
""It will be in default, it will be in arrears vis-a-vis the IMF on July 1, but I hope it is not the case, I really do,"" Lagarde said. ""There is no grace period or two-month delay, as I have seen here and there.""
Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, meanwhile, reminded his creditors of comments made by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi on the importance of a cohesive, unified European Union, which could be threatened if the nation leaves the euro zone.
""Some time ago Mario Draghi said quite correctly that for the euro to succeed anywhere it has to succeed everywhere,"" Varoufakis told reporters before the meeting. ""We think he is absolutely spot on and today we are going to be presenting the Greek government's ideas along those line. The purpose is to replace costly discord with effusive consensus.""
Varoufakis later wrote on a blog post that a proposal Greece outlined to its creditors on Thursday included: a reduction in non-wage costs, a method for unifying public sector payrolls and a short-term program for limiting foreclosures. Before leaving the meeting, Dijsselbloem told reporters that the proposals were not sufficient.
Elsewhere, the U.S. Dollar Index plunged to a monthly-low of 93.71, before rallying slightly to 94.25. The dollar continued its sharp decline one day after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen refused to offer any explicit wording on the timing of its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, increasing the possibility that the Fed could wait until December for lift-off.

USD/CHF hit lows of 0.9174, the weakest since May 18, down from around 0.9219 ahead of the announcement.

The SNB said negative rates should help to weaken the currency over time.
Negative rates effectively mean banks are paying the central bank to hold their money.
The central bank said uncertainty about the global economy “remains high,” particularly the threat of a Greek default.
“Various risks – first and foremost the difficult financial situation in Greece and geopolitical tensions, could jeopardize the recovery,” the bank’s statement said.
The bank reiterated that it is prepared to remain active in currency markets to reduce the impact of the “overvalued” franc on the economy.
""The SNB takes account of the exchange rate situation, and its impact on inflation and economic developments, in formulating its monetary policy,"" the SNB said.
""It will therefore remain active in the foreign exchange market, as necessary, in order to influence monetary conditions.""
The Swiss franc is seen as a safe haven investment because of Switzerland's current account surplus, which means it’s not reliant on foreign investment to fund its budget.
Switzerland’s central bank cut its interest rate target into negative territory in January. The move was announced at the same time the bank scrapped its cap of 1.20 francs per euro, which sent the franc sharply higher.
The SNB said it expects economic growth of just below 1% this year, unchanged from its March forecast.
It said consumer prices will fall 1% this year and 0.4% in 2016, before picking up in 2017.

EUR/USD gained 0.0094 or 0.79% to settle at 1.1336 on Wednesday, marking the first time the pair closed above 1.13 in the last six sessions. While the FOMC opted to keep its benchmark Fed Funds Rate at its current level of zero to 0.25% on Wednesday, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated that the U.S. Central Bank will take a ""data-driven approach,"" to the timing of its first rate hike since June, 2006.
“Certainly an increase this year is possible,” Yellen said during a news conference in Washington. “We could certainly see data that would justify that.”
In terms of expectations for future economic conditions, 10 members of the FOMC built in two quarter-point interest rate hikes for the remainder of 2015, sending the clearest indication in months that the Fed could raise rates this year. The FOMC also upgraded its economic outlook in its Federal Funds Rate Target, otherwise known as its ""dot plot.""
Despite the increased possibility of a rate hike this year, the Fed still expects to raise rates gradually on a longer-term basis. In its statement released on Wednesday, the Fed indicated that the median level of the FOMC's target for the Federal Funds Rate fell 25 basis points from its March projection for each of the next two years. By the end of 2016, the Fed projects the rate will reach 1.625%, down from 1.875% in March. A year later, the Fed anticipates that it will lift the rate to 2.875%, also down slightly from its March projection of 3.125%.
Future contracts based on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch indicated on Wednesday that investors now think there is a stronger chance lift-off will occur in December, opposed to the fall. The dovish stance sent the euro soaring, as it moved to a session-high of 1.1348, up from a level of 1.1257 before the Fed's announcement.
""The importance of the initial increase should not be overstated,"" Yellen said, adding that interest rates will be ""highly accommodative,"" for quite some time.
Yellen reiterated on Wednesday that the Fed would like to see improvements in the U.S. economy and labor market before it begins policy normalization. In last month's robust jobs report, the U.S. economy added 280,000 jobs in May, while hourly wage growth increased by 0.3%.
“We agree labor market slack has diminished to some extent,” Yellen added.
The Fed also downgraded its expectations for GDP growth for the year, slashing it to a level between 1.8%-2.0%, down from previous of forecasts of 2.3 to 2.7%. As for unemployment forecasts, the FOMC revised its projections to 5.2-5.3% from previous estimates of 5.0 to 5.2%.
In addition, the FOMC left its projections for PCE Inflation for 2015 unchanged at 0.6 to 0.8. For 2016, the FOMC revised inflation projections to 1.6 to 1.9%, slightly down from estimates of 1.7 to 1.9% in March. By 2017, the FOMC anticipates that PCE Inflation will rise to 1.9-2.0%, leaving its March projection unchanged. Long-term inflation has remained below the Fed's targeted goal of 2% for the last 36 months.
In Europe, the Greece Central Bank warned that the nation could be facing an ""uncontrollable crisis,"" if a deal is not reached with its international creditors to unlock critical aid deemed necessary to stave off bankruptcy.

Investors were looking ahead to a monetary policy meeting of the Swiss National Bank on Thursday. Most analysts expected the SNB to keep monetary policy on hold, but recent weak inflation data raised concerns that it could ease policy further.
Switzerland’s central bank cut its interest rate target into negative territory, between minus 1.25% and minus 0.25% in January. The move was announced at the same time the bank scrapped its cap of 1.20 francs per euro, which sent the franc sharply higher.
The SNB could push rates further into negative territory, or charge even higher negative interest rates on some of the banks who deposit funds with it.
Negative rates effectively mean banks are paying the central bank to hold their money.

1292,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 16, 2015 05:12PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls mildly amid uncertainty with Greece, Fed rate hike","Investing.com -- EUR/USD moved lower on Tuesday reversing some of the gains from one session earlier, as investors awaited highly anticipated comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, as well as further developments in the Greek Debt negotiations before making any significant trades.
The currency pair ticked down 0.0035 or 0.31% to 1.1250, ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's quarterly press conference on Wednesday. EUR/USD traded in a broad range of 1.11205 and 1.1329, closing above 1.12 for the eighth consecutive session.
The pair likely gained support at 1.1150, the low from June 12 and was met with resistance at 1.1386, the high from June 10.
While the Fed has indicated that it could raise interest rates following the end of Wednesday's June meeting, it is more likely that the U.S. Central Bank will wait until September before lifting rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The Fed would like to see significant improvements in wage and GDP growth, along with indications that inflation is moving toward its target goal of 2% before it raises its benchmark Fed Funds Rate above its current level of zero to 0.25%. Since its last meeting, the U.S. economy added 280,000 jobs in May while hourly wages rose significantly by 0.3%. Retail sales, meanwhile, a closely watched metric, surged by 1.2% last month, fueled by increases in motor vehicle and gas sales.
Close observers of the Fed will likely focus intently on its Federal Funds Rate Target for clues on how gradually it plans to hike rates after initial liftoff. Previously, the Federal Reserve set a target of between 0.5% and 1.0% for December, which it expects will increase to 1.5 and 2.0% by December, 2016. A year later, the Fed projects its benchmark rate will exceed 3.0%.
When the Fed released the minutes from its April meeting last month, it expressed concern that interest rates could spike after initial lift-off, citing the possibility of an increased role of high frequency trading, decreases in inventories held by broker-dealers and the potential for higher assets in bond funds. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained 0.13% to 95.22 amid mixed U.S. housing data. In a monthly report, the U.S. Department of Commerce said the number of building permits for future home construction surged nearly 12% to an eight-year high at 1.28 million units. Although monthly housing starts dipped 11.1% to 1.04 million units, the Commerce Department upwardly revised an already robust figure from April to 1.17 million units.
In Europe, there were few developments in the Greek Debt negotiations ahead of Thursday's meeting of the euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg. Greece is running out of time to strike a deal before the remainder of its €240 billion bailout expires on June 30. Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras criticized the International Monetary Fund for imposing measures he believes are too stringent. Last week, the IMF abruptly broke off talks in Brussels citing differences in pension reforms, taxes and financing.
""The big contradiction is the IMF's presence, which wants measures and a restructuring, (whereas) the others want measures but no restructuring,"" Tsipras told reporters. ""They want an a-la-carte IMF.""

One day after officials from the International Monetary Fund abruptly broke off talks with Greece in Brussels, Netherlands finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem warned that it is practically ""unimaginable"" for a Greek deal to be completed without the assistance of the IMF. Previously, the head of the euro group of finance ministers indicated that an agreement could be reached at next week's meeting in Luxembourg after Greece reportedly neared an incremental deal with Germany to accept some of the austerity measures proposed by chancellor Angela Merkel in exchange for receiving a portion of the remaining €7.2 billion left in a €240 billion bailout.
On Friday, Greece reportedly submitted a new proposal to its international creditors, according to the Financial Times. The proposal included concessions on debt restructuring, but did not include any pension reform – a major sticking point for the IMF. A day earlier, IMF officials cut tense negotiations short amid a wide rift in pension, tax and financing considerations between the two sides.
Greece is running out of time before the extension of the bailout expires on June 30. The cash-strapped nation also owes a bundled payment of 1.5 billion to the IMF at the end of the month.
""If the Greek government isn't willing to take difficult measures, even if they're unpopular, then Greece will never be saved,"" Dijsselbloem said.
Stocks among a wide sampling of Greek Banks – the National Bank of Greece, Alpha Bank, Eurobank Ergasias and Piraeus Bank SA – tumbled on Friday, each declining by more than 10% on the session.

Officials from the International Monetary Fund on Thursday hastily ended negotiations with Greece in Brussels, amid a lack of progress.

""The IMF never leaves the table, the ball is very much in Greece's court,"" Rice said.
Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras met with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for roughly two hours on Thursday before members of the Greek bailout team left Brussels.

""We're working in order to bridge the remaining differences and especially the differences on fiscal and financial issues,"" Tsipras said. ""We are working to assure an agreement which will ensure that Greece will recover with social cohesion and viable public debts.""
On Wednesday evening, the parties accomplished little headway in a meeting between Tsipras, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and France president Francois Hollande on the sidelines of the EU-CELAC summit. Earlier, reports surfaced that Merkel had been prepared to offer Greece an incremental deal if the cash-strapped nation agreed to some of the austerity measures its international creditors proposed days earlier. The reforms include: a higher imposition of taxes, the issuance of less generous retirement benefits to municipal workers and increased state asset sales, according to reports.
Despite Thursday's breakdown in talks, the IMF indicated on Thursday that managing director Christine Lagarde could be present at negotiations next week when a group of euro zone finance ministers meet in Luxembourg. Greece is running out of time before a EUR 1.5 billion obligation is due to the IMF at the end of the month.

1339,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 10, 2015 05:13PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ticks up, as Greece nears incremental deal with creditors","Investing.com -- EUR/USD rose modestly on Wednesday to reverse mild losses one session earlier, as Germany reportedly neared a breakthrough with Greece on an incremental cash-for-reforms package that could help the cash-strapped nation avoid default on its sovereign debt.
The euro gained 0.0045 or 0.40% to move to 1.1324 on Wednesday against its American counterpart. EUR/USD traded between 1.1264 and 1.1386 on a choppy day of trading. The pair remained over 1.10 for the seventh consecutive session.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0913, the low from June 2 and was met with resistance at 1.1450, the high from May 17.
In Brussels, Bloomberg reported that Germany chancellor Angela Merkel is prepared to offer an incremental deal to Greece if the cash-strapped nation is committed to accepting some of the reforms proposed by its creditors last week. The reforms include: a higher imposition of taxes, the issuance of less generous retirement benefits to municipal workers and increased state asset sales, according to reports. Merkel could be satisfied with a deal if Greece commits to at least one of the aforementioned reforms.
In exchange for the austerity measures, the plan reportedly calls for Greece to receive a small disbursement of the remaining €7.2 billion of a €240 billion bailout. The staggered aid package could be enough for Greece to meet a €1.5 billion obligation to the International Monetary Fund at the end of the month.
It is unknown if the disbursement will be enough to cover separate obligations to the IMF and the European Central Bank later this summer. Greece owes a €0.5 billion loan repayment to the IMF in mid-July, followed by a €3.5 billion payment to the ECB a week later. At the start of August, Greece owes a modest €0.2 billion repayment to the IMF before another payment of more than €3.0 billion is due to the ECB at the end of the month. Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras is scheduled to meet with France president Francois Hollande and Merkel on Wednesday evening. The developments could ease fears that Greece could leave the European Union and possibly default on its sovereign debt.
""Grexit is off the table, we want to keep Greece in the euro zone,"" Spain's economic minister Luis de Guindos told Reuters.
Reports also surfaced that Greece could be willing to another concession by accepting its creditors' proposal of a 1% primary budget surplus on its GDP this year. In a 47-page proposal submitted last week, Greece appeared willing to only accept a primary surplus of 0.6%. Also on Wednesday, Netherlands finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said it is possible a deal could be struck when the euro group of finance ministers meets next on June 18.
Before then, more progress could be made on Thursday when Tsipras is scheduled to meet with EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.
Elsewhere, the improved economic outlook in Europe continued to extend the ongoing bond rout in the euro zone. Yields on German 10-Year bunds hit 1% for the first time since September, while yields on Italian 10-Year bonds reached their highest level since November. The sell-off spilled over to the U.S. where yields on 10-Year Treasuries approached 2.5% before falling back to 2.486, a gain of five basis points.

USD/JPY fell 1.21% to 122.49, the weakest since May 26 and was last at 122.84, well below the 13-year peaks of 125.84 struck last Friday.
The yen rallied after Kuroda said the real effective exchange rate shows the Japanese currency is ""very weak"".
The real effective exchange rate measures the yen’s levels relative to the currencies of Japan’s trading partners.
Kuroda also said the dollar may not necessarily rise further against the yen if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates as it is already priced into the market.
The comments came as Kuroda addressed parliament’s financial affairs committee.
The dollar rose to 13-year peaks against the yen on Friday after an above forecast U.S. jobs report underlined expectations that the Fed could start to raise rates at its September meeting.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.39% to 94.80, pressured lower by the stronger yen.
The euro was also sharply lower against the yen, with EUR/JPY down 0.97% to 138.92.
The single currency pushed higher against the dollar, with EUR/USD up 0.23% to 1.1307 although ongoing uncertainty over Greece held gains in check.
Athens was expected to resume talks on a cash-for-reforms deal with its international lenders later in the day.
Greece’s bailout agreement with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund is set to expire at the end of this month and it cannot make further debt repayments without a new deal.

1353,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 09, 2015 05:10PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls mildly, as key issues in Greek talks remain unresolved ","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell mildly on Tuesday one session after moving sharply higher, as the two sides in Greek debt negotiations reportedly remained far apart on a number of key issues. 
EUR/USD inched down 0.0011 or 0.10% on Tuesday to close at 1.1280. In spite of Tuesday's minor downturn, the pair has still remained above 1.10 for the last seven sessions. EUR/USD traded in a tight range of 1.1214 and 1.1344, ahead of Wednesday's key meeting between Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Germany chancellor Angela Merkel in Brussels.
The pair likely gained support at 1.1048, the low on June 4 and was met with resistance at 1.1381, the high on June 5.
Tsipras is reportedly approaching the meeting with a more conciliatory position than prior attempts over the last few weeks in an effort to reach a breakthrough in the slow-moving talks. Following the latest stalemate in tense negotiations, Tsipras has offered to make a series of concessions through raising Value-Added Tax rates and accepting higher budget surplus targets. France president Francois Hollande is also scheduled to attend the meeting.
Earlier, euro zone officials promptly dismissed Greece's latest proposal on tax, debt and budget reforms. Despite initial reports claiming that the two sides were hours from striking a deal late last week, Greece and its international creditors are still not close to reaching an accord after submitting divergent proposals on a cash-for-reforms plan. Greek officials reportedly scrambled on Tuesday to revise their latest proposal that was rejected by leaders of the European Central Bank and European Commission.
Greece's European creditors have pressured the cash-strapped nation to back away from pre-election promises earlier this year to undo massive cuts in pension benefits and other government programs. A previous bailout prior to Tsipras' victory in January forced Greece to slash retirement benefits that comprise approximately 16% of the nation's GDP.
The creditors are hoping to establish substantial penalties for Greek citizens who opt for early-retirement, as well as raise taxes on utilities and basic consumer goods such as medicine. Tsipras has described the proposal as ""irrational.""
By the end of the month, Greece owes the International Monetary Fund a sum of €1.1 billion after it bundled four separate obligations to the organization late last week into one payment. On Monday, Merkel told reporters at the G7 summit in Germany that Greece is running out of time to reach a deal.
Meanwhile, currency traders continued to digest optimistic U.S. jobs data last week that could increase the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by September. The U.S. Department of Labor said non-farm payrolls increased by 280,000 in May, above expectations for a 220,000 gain. More importantly, average hourly wages surged by 0.3% from the prior month, above forecasts for a 0.1% uptick.
On Monday, Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota announced that he will be stepping down to accept a position as an economics professor at the University of Rochester. The departure of Korcherlakota, a noted Dove on the Fed, could indicate that an interest rate hike might be imminent.
Yields on 10-year government bonds throughout the euro zone continued to spike. Yields on German and French 10-year bonds each rose seven basis points to 0.95% and 1.28% respectively, while yields on Italianand Spanish 10-year bonds each moved above 2.25%.

EUR/USD soared more than 0.19 points or 1.81% to 1.1303 to end a short three-day skid. The currency pair traded between 1.1085 and 1.1307, rising steadily during U.S. afternoon trading. The euro has now gained at least 1% on the dollar in three of the last six sessions. EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1078, the low from June 3 and was met with resistance at 1.1450 the high from May 18. The pair has remained below 1.14 ever since, as a wave of optimistic U.S. economic data has increased the possibility that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates by September.
On Monday, United Kingdom prime minister David Cameron denied making comments that other ministers will lose their position if they refuse to back him in a referendum for the nation to leave the EU in 2017. Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Germany, Cameron said that his comments regarding a Brexit were ""misinterpreted.""
""If you want to be part of the government you have to take the view that we are engaged in an exercise of renegotiation to have a referendum and that will lead to a successful outcome,"" Cameron said on Sunday night ahead of the summit. ""Everyone in government has signed up to the program set out in the Conservative manifesto.""
Also in Germany, U.S. president Barack Obama urged both sides in the Greek Debt negotiations to work collaboratively to reach a deal. The comments come several days after Greece delayed a €300 million loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund on Friday, opting to bundle four obligations due this month into one €1.1 payment at the end of June.
""The Greeks are going to have to follow through and make some tough political choices that will be good for them long-term,"" Obama said at a news conference.
In addition, Obama added that international lenders should ""recognize the extraordinary challenges,"" that Greece is encountering and should work to reach an accord.
European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer, meanwhile, intensified pressure on Greece to revise a proposal to its international creditors, by insisting that if the Mediterranean state left the EU it would not create a problem for the currency bloc. Greece has used the threat of departure as leverage in negotiations, as it stubbornly refuses to agree to a series of austerity measures the creditors have deemed necessary to unlock a critical stimulus package. Greece is reportedly dangerously close to running out of cash as an extension to the remaining amounts of a €240 bailout looms at the end of this month.

China said May exports fell 2.5%, less than the 5% drop seen, while imports dropped 17.6%, much more than the slide of 10.7% expected.
China customs gave the trade surplus as RMB366.8 billion, with a dollar figure set at $59.49 billion, well above the $44.95 billion forecast.

Earlier, the yen strengthened on Monday after data suggested the economy grew faster than earlier estimated in the first quarter with investors next ready for China trade data and the latest remarks on debt talks with Greece.
Japan revised first quarter GDP up to a pace of 1% quarter-on-quarter from a preliminary 0.6% gain and an expected upward revision to 0.7%. The revised GDP data showed the economic recovery has gained traction, reaching a 3.9% annual growth rate, and overcoming the drag from last year's sales tax hike and economists expect GDP to mark the third straight growth quarter in April-June, but at a slower pace.
At the weekend, European Parliament President Martin Schulz urged Greece in a newspaper interview to accept a proposal by its international lenders for a cash-for-reforms deal, warning Athens that failing to reach an agreement would have ""dramatic"" consequences.
The European Union is willing to compromise with the Greek government, Schulz told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in an interview published on Sunday, adding that the lenders had already made concessions in the debt negotiations.
""I can only warn the Greek government against turning down the hand held out to them,"" Schulz, who has been supportive of Greece's cause, said. ""Time is running out and the consequences would be dramatic.""
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a weighted-basket of currencies, rose 0.09% to 96.47.

The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 280,000 jobs in May, ahead of economists forecast for 220,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 5.5% from 5.4% in the previous month.
April’s payrolls report was revised to show that 221,000 jobs were created.
Hourly earnings increased 0.3% in May, after a 0.2% increase in April.
The upbeat data, particularly the pick-up in wage growth underlined the view that the economy is on track to rebound after a weak first quarter and bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve could start to hike interest rates at its September policy meeting.
The dollar rallied against the other major currencies following the release of the data.
In the week ahead, investors will be focused on the euro zone, while reports on euro zone industrial production will also be closely watched.

1385,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 05, 2015 05:26PM ET</span>","EUR/USD moves lower amid positive U.S. jobs data, Greek impasse","Investing.com -- The euro fell sharply against the dollar on Friday extending losses from the previous session, as positive U.S. jobs data reinforced the notion that the Federal Reserve could institute its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade at some point this year.

EUR/USD plunged 0.0123 or 1.10% to 1.1115, capping a choppy week for the currency pair. For the week, the euro edged up 1.45% after opening on Monday below 1.10. The pair traded between a low of 1.1050 and a peak of 1.1280 on Friday.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0913, the low from June 1 and was met with resistance at 1.1328 the high from May 19.

The pair moved lower in U.S. morning trading after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released better than expected job figures for the month of May. Last month, U.S. non-farm payrolls soared by 280,000, far exceeding analysts' low end of forecasts for a 220,000 gain. Private payrolls increased by 262,000 in May, as professional business services added 63,000 positions on the month. The labor market also added 17,000 construction position, following a significant gain of 35,000 a month earlier.





More importantly, average hourly wages surged by 0.3% on a month-to-month basis up from a 0.1% increase in April. The Fed would like to see robust wage growth and inflation move toward its targeted goal of 2% before it institutes its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. While the economy grew at a tepid pace over the last several months, Hawkish members of the Fed argued that temporary drags such as severe winter weather and a West Coast port labor dispute disproportionately restrained growth. The Labor Department also upwardly revised jobs figures for the previous two months further underscoring the Hawkish viewpoints.

While the unemployment rate inched up to 5.5% in May, the Labor Force Participation rate also moved higher last month, increasing 0.1% to 62.9%.

The figures pushed yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries up more than 10 basis points to 2.409%, its highest level in six months. Bond prices fall when yields rise. High yields are also a sign of improving growth in the economy.

Yields on German 10-Yea bonds, meanwhile, inched down one basis point to 0.84% as the spread between U.S. and German 10-year sovereign debt increased to more than 157 basis points.

Elsewhere, the two sides in the Greek Debt negotiations failed to reached an agreement on Friday. Earlier this week, France president Francois Hollande said Greece and its international creditors appeared to be hours from reaching a deal on agreement that could unlock critical aid to the beleaguered nation. Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras, though, may have rankled creditors on Thursday by bundling four separate obligations to the IMF into one repayment at the end of this month. In doing so, Greece delayed repayment of a €300 million payment due on Friday.

In a defiant speech to Parliament, Tsipras urged European leaders to withdraw a proposal Greece viewed as unrealistic.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained 0.93% to 96.38.

EUR/USD dipped 0.0031 or 0.28% on the session to fall to 1.1243, following two days of sharp moves when it appreciated by more than 3%. At one point on Thursday, though, the pair shot up to a session-high of 1.1379, marking the first time it exceeded 1.13 in nearly two weeks. EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1001 the low from May 22 and was met with resistance at 1.1450, the high from May 18.
Following a five-hour meeting with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras appeared hopeful that a deal between the two sides could be imminent. The two were later joined by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers. While Tsipras characterized the talks as ""friendly and constructive,"" he remained adamant that any proposal, which included the removal of the nation's Social Solidarity Benefit for low-income pensioners and the increase of a Value Added Tax by 10 points on electricity payments could not be a ""basis for discussion.""
Although the European Commission indicated that ""progress was made in understanding each other's positions,"" it still emphasized that no agreement had been reached. The two sides are expected to meet again before Tsipras is scheduled to address Greek Parliament on the progress of the negotiations on Friday evening.
Tsipras may have rankled his negotiating partners on Thursday when Athens announced that it will bundle four separate obligations to the International Monetary Fund into one payment of €1.1 billion at the end of the month. Although the move is allowed under IMF bylaws, it could be interpreted as a further indication of Greece's unwillingness to cooperate with its negotiating partners. Greece had faced a €300 million payment due on Friday.
The two sides have made a significant amount of progress in the tense negotiations over the last several days, easing fears that Greece could leave the euro and potentially default on its sovereign debt. Both sides reportedly submitted proposals this week for a deal, which could unlock the final €7.2 billion of a €240 billion bailout to Greece.
Elsewhere, the IMF said in its annual analysis of the U.S. economy on Thursday that the Fed should delay lift-off on raising interest rates until the first half of 2016 unless there are significant improvements in wage and inflationary growth. Investors await Friday's release of the U.S. jobs report from the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics for further indications on the strength of the U.S. labor market.
On Thursday, the Labor Department said in a weekly report that initial jobless claims for the week ending on May 30 declined by 8,000 to 276,000 from the previous week. Analysts expected initial jobless claims to fall by 5,000 to 279,000 last week.

The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1.1081 and 1.1284, its daily-high, before settling at 1.1276, up 0.0123 or 1.10%. EUR/USD extended the gains from Tuesday's rally when it soared more than 2%, as better than expected inflationary data in the euro zone for May coincided with weak U.S. factory orders. The euro is also up more than 3.6% against its American counterpart since May 26 when it touched down to a monthly-low at 1.0818.
Despite wild fluctuations in the pair throughout the spring, the euro is near its same level from February when the ECB announced the launch of an ambitious €60 billion a month quantitative easing program. Draghi tacitly endorsed the early success of the program on Wednesday by raising the ECB's inflation expectations to an average of 0.3% for the remainder of the year. One of the primary goals of the bond buying initiative at its inception was to stave off prolonged deflation in the euro zone.
Initially, the ECB intended to continue the €1.1 trillion program through September, 2016 if inflation moved toward its targeted goal of 2% and the European economy showed other signs of improvement. When pressed on Wednesday on whether the ECB could end the program sooner than expected, Draghi responded that the ECB could in fact expand the program “if other factors would create an unwanted tightening of monetary policy.""
Draghi also triggered a sell-off in European sovereign debt by telling investors they should expect ""periods of high volatility,"" in the bond markets. Germany 10-year bunds soared 17 basis points to 0.88%, its highest level since October. Yields on British, French and Dutch 10-year bonds all rose by at least 10 basis points.
Draghi, however, provided little to no hints on how the ECB could respond to a variety of scenarios related to negotiations with Greece, saying only that he would like to reach a ""strong"" agreement to settle the impasse.
Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras, meanwhile, is scheduled to hold another series of talks with the nation's international creditors on Wednesday evening. Greece has described its latest proposal to its troika of creditors as its ""last, best offer."" Athens officials said Wednesday that it will delay payment on a €305 million obligation to the International Monetary Fund on Friday if a deal is not reached in the next several days. France president Francois Hollande is hopeful that the two sides are only ""hours apart"" from reaching an accord.
Elsewhere, the bond sell-off in Europe spilled over to U.S. markets as yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries spiked 10 basis points to 2.388%, its highest level since November.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.5% to 95.33.
USD/CAD gained 0.40% to 1.2451, while USD/JDY rose 0.12% to 124.26."

1426,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 02, 2015 05:39PM ET</span>","EUR/USD enjoys best day since mid-March, amid developments in Greece","Investing.com -- The euro surged against the dollar on Tuesday posting its largest one-day rally in nearly three months, as ambiguities related to the Greek debt crisis and poor U.S. economic data remained in focus.
EUR/USD soared more than 2.15% to an intraday high of 1.1192 before falling slightly back to 1.1153 in U.S. afternoon trading. Still, the pair finished with its sharpest daily gain since Mar. 18 and closed above 1.10 for the first time in eight sessions.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1001 the low from May 22 and was met with resistance at 1.1328, the high from May 19.
In Berlin, high-level talks between top monetary policymakers and leaders of Germany and France on Monday evening dragged past Midnight, as the officials worked to craft a strategy on how to approach what could be the final round of talks with Greece. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel, France president Francois Hollande and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker were among the officials present at the meeting.
The meetings transpired days before a Greek deadline to meet a €304 million obligation to the IMF on Friday. In total, Greece owes more than €1.1 billion to the IMF in four separate payments by the end of this month.
The leaders ""agreed that work must now be continued with greater intensity,” according to a statement issued by Merkel's office. The officials ""have been in closest contact in recent days,"" the statement continued, ""and want to remain so in the coming days, both among themselves and naturally also with the Greek government.""
Yields on Greek 10-Year bonds plunged nine basis points to 10.96%, underscoring optimism that a deal can be reached. By comparison, yields on the Greek 10-year bonds have soared more than 510 basis points this year.
Last week, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the two sides were close to completing a technical draft of an agreement that could unlock critical aid thought to be needed for Greece to stave off bankruptcy. Euro zone officials downplayed the developments.
Elsewhere, euro zone inflation ticked up 0.3% in May increasing from zero a month earlier and above expectations for a 0.2% increase. The rise may provide validation for Draghi that the ECB's comprehensive €60 billion a month quantitative easing program is working. Yields on other sovereign debt throughout Europe shot up, as a result. Yields on Germany 10-Year bunds increased 17 basis points to 0.71%, while yields on the Spanish and the Italian 10-Year bonds each gained at least 12 basis points to move above 2%.
The sell-off spilled over to U.S. bond markets, as yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries rose nearly eight basis points to 2.26%, its highest level since May 13. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, plunged more than 1.6% to an intraday low of 95.72, as investors unwound from their long positions in the dollar. Weak demand in April caused new orders for factory goods to dip 0.4% for the month following a 2.2% gain in March.

EUR/USD dipped 0.0033 or 0.31% to 1.0924, remaining under 1.10 for the sixth consecutive session. The pair fluctuated between 1.0888 and 1.0979 on a choppy day of trading. EUR/USD has been relatively stable since the dollar appreciated sharply against the euro late last month. Over the last 11 sessions, the pair has moved less than 1% in either an up or down direction.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0867 the low from May 28 and was met with resistance at 1.1006 the high from May 29.
While currency traders await a potential deal between Greece and its troika of creditors on an agreement that could unlock critical aid to the beleaguered Mediterranean nation, there were significant developments on Monday in the slow-moving negotiations. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde headed to Berlin where they will be joined by German and French leaders for a series of high-level meetings aimed at mapping out a strategy for approaching what could be the final round of talks.
The meetings come ahead of Greece's deadline on Friday to meet a €304 million obligation to the IMF. In total, Greece owes more than €1.1 billion to the IMF in loan payments this month. Greece missed a self-imposed deadline on Sunday to strike a deal with its creditors. Athens has resisted instituting a wide of range of austerty measures deemed necessary for it to receive the final €7.2 billion of a 240 billion bailout. The protracted stand-off has exacerbated fears that Greece could leave the European Union and default on its sovereign debt.
Yields on Greek 10-Year bonds jumped 18 basis points to 11.04%. Yields on German 10-Year bunds, rose five basis points to 0.54%, while yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries gained more than eight basis points to 2.183%. The spread between U.S. and German 10-year yields increased to 164 basis points.
Elsewhere, EUR/USD shot up after the Institute of Supply Management released its manufacturing composite index in U.S. morning trading. In the month of May, the index surged to 52.8, its highest level in three months. The reading outperformed the high end of consensus forecasts of 52.7. New orders, meanwhile, soared to a 55.8 level, its highest reading of the year.
At the same time, the U.S. Department of Commerce said consumer spending for April was flat, slightly below expectations of a 0.2% gain. Spending on durable goods weighed heavily, declining by 0.7% in April. A month earlier, overall consumer spending in March increased by 0.5%. Meanwhile, inflation for the month was also flat slightly below analysts' forecasts of a 0.1% gain. The Core PCE index, excluding food and energy prices, rose by 0.1%, below expectations of a 0.2% increase. On a year-over-year basis, the index is up 1.4% -- also below yearly gains in the April CPI of 1.8%. The Federal Reserve wants to see inflation near its targeted goal of 2% during a two-year period before it raises its benchmark Fed Funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged to an intraday high of 97.76, nearing its highest level in five weeks, before falling back to 97.51 in the U.S. afternoon session."

GBP/USD hit lows of 1.5237 the weakest since May 8 and was last at 1.5284, down 0.25%. Sterling ended the week down 1.2%.
The pound has come under pressure amid renewed concerns over a U.K. referendum on EU membership. Prime Minister David Cameron’s government introduced a law in parliament on Thursday to ensure the referendum will be held by the end of 2017.
Sentiment on the pound was also hit after a report on Friday showed that British consumer sentiment deteriorated unexpectedly this month as optimism about the economy over the next 12 months declined.
The report came just one day after official figures confirmed that the U.K. economy grew just 0.3% in the first quarter, fuelling concerns that the economic recovery is losing momentum.
Recent soft economic data has underlined expectations that the Bank of England will leave interest rates on hold for longer.

1457,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2015 05:32PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ends volatile May up for the session, but down for the month","Investing.com -- The euro posted moderate gains against the dollar on Friday extending its rally to a third consecutive session, amid mixed U.S. economic data and continued instability regarding the Greek debt crisis.
EUR/USD gained 0.0039 or 0.36% to end the session at 1.0987. The pair has still yet to move back above 1.10 since falling nearly 1% on Tuesday when the dollar appreciated by its highest one-day amount in almost two years.
For the month, the euro fell roughly 2% against the dollar after opening May above 1.12. Wild fluctuations in the pair throughout May ostensibly kept currency traders on their toes. The pair surged to a three-month high of 1.1467 on May 15, before falling to a monthly low of 1.0819 on May 27, a spread of nearly 6.5%.
The pair spiked to a session-high of 1.0990 roughly an hour after U.S. GDP for the first quarter was revised downward to minus 0.7% in U.S. morning trading. The reading was in line with analysts' expectations of a downward revision of minus 0.8%. When the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) initially released first quarter GDP, it reported an increase of 0.2% from the previous quarter.
A surge in imports to 5.6% from an initial gain of 1.8%, linked to an abrupt unloading of imports at West Coast ports was thought to be responsible for the revision. A port work stoppage throughout the winter weighed on the U.S. economy in the first quarter. First quarter GDP was also sluggish in 2014, when it fell by 2.1% from the previous quarter. For the second quarter, U.S. GDP is expected to gain roughly 3% during the period as transitory factors recede.
Separately, a rebound over the last two weeks lifted the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey to 90.7, above a mid-month flash of 88.6. The reading is still down significantly from April's level of 95.9. Consumer expectations, meanwhile, fell to 84.2 from 88.8, illustrating diminished confidence in the long-term outlook of the labor market.
In Brussels, there were conflicting reports of the level of progress made in ongoing talks between Greece and its troika of creditors. Officials from the euro zone said late Thursday evening that a deal which would unlock critical aid to Athens was ""not imminent,"" in spite of contrary reports. Earlier, Greece was hopeful a solution could be reached by Sunday. Greek officials are growing increasingly desperate to reach a deal before several obligations are due to the International Monetary Fund in June totaling more than €1.5 billion.
Yields on Greek 10-Year bonds rose 12 basis points to 10.86%. Over the last year, the yields are up nearly 500 basis points. Yields on German 10-Year bunds fell four basis points to 0.49%, while yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries dropped one basis point to 2.12%. The spread between U.S. and German 10-year bonds fell to 163 basis points.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.18% to 96.94. Earlier in the week, the index soared to a five-week high at 97.88."

In a preliminary report, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis said gross domestic product slipped 0.7% in the first three months of 2015, compared to expectations for a 0.8% decline and following a growth rate of 0.2% in the last quarter of 2014.
Separately, the University of Michigan said, in a revised report, that its consumer sentiment index rose to 90.7 in May from 88.6 the previous month, compared to expectations for a rise to 89.9.
The UoM also said its inflation expectations for the next 12 months ticked down to 2.8% in May from 2.9% in April.
Data also showed that the Chicago purchasing managers' index fell to 46.2 this month from a reading of 52.3 in April, compared to expectations for an uptick to 53.0.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down -% to -, still close to Wednesday's five-week highs of 97.88.
USD/JPY edged down 0.08% to 123.85, not far from Thursday's 13-year peak of 124.47.
In Japan, data earlier showed that industrial production increased by 1.0% last month, exceeding expectations for a 0.8% rise, after a 0.8% fall in March.
A separate report showed that Japan's household spending dropped 5.5% in April, compared to expectations for a 0.7% slip, after a 2.4% rise the previous month.
Data also showed that consumer prices in Japan ticked up at an annualized rate of 0.6% last month, in line with expectations, after a 2.3% increase in March.
The euro was higher, with EUR/USD up 0.31% to 1.0980 after data showed that German retail sales rose 1.7% last month, beating expectations for a 0.8% gain.
Separately, a preliminary report showed that Spanish consumer prices slipped 0.2% this month, compared to expectations for a 0.5% decline, after a 0.6% fall in April.
But gains were capped as Greece's creditors said late Thursday that a deal to unlock rescue aid was not imminent. Athens had claimed a solution could be reached by Sunday.
The pound remained lower, with GBP/USD down 0.28% to 1.5275, while the Swiss franc pushed higher, with USD/CHF retreating 0.63% to 0.9382.
Data earlier showed that the KOF economic barometer for Switzerland rose to 93.1 this month from 89.8 in April, whose figure was revised from a previously estimated reading of 89.5. Analysts had expected the barometer to rise to 90.0 in May.
The Australian dollar was little changed, with AUD/USD at 0.7648, while NZD/USD declined 0.84% to trade at 0.7117.
USD/CAD climbed 0.50% to 1.2495, re-approaching Thursday's six-week highs of 1.2538. Data on Friday showed that Canada's GDP slipped 0.2% in March, confounding expectations for an increase of 0.2%, after a 0.1% fall from the previous month.

In Brussels, there were few developments in talks between Greece and its troika of creditors from the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission, as the beleaguered nation looks to reach an accord which would unlock critical aid deemed necessary to stave off bankruptcy. One day earlier, Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the sides had moved closer to striking a deal after beginning the initial process of drafting a technical level agreement. European officials reportedly have downplayed the developments.
A deal in the four-month stalemate could free up the remaining €7.2 billion of a 240 billion bailout euro zone creditors have provided to the cash-strapped Mediterranean nation. Greece is in desperate need of the stimulus package as it reportedly grows closer to running out of cash by the day. Before the deadline to reach an agreement expires at the end of June, Greece owes approximately €1.6 billion to the International Monetary Fund over several payments due next month.
Yields on Greece 10-Year bonds rose 16 basis points to 10.74%, one day after bond prices surged amid heightened expectations of a deal. 
Meanwhile, two prominent Federal Reserve policymakers offered divergent views on the timing of an interest rate hike in speeches on opposite ends of the globe. Delivering a speech to a banking supervision conference in Singapore, San Francisco Fed president John Williams said he thinks the Fed will raise rates at some point this year while predicting above-trend growth in the U.S. economy for the rest of 2015. Hours later, Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota indicated that it would be a mistake for the Fed to institute a rate hike this year, adding that it would take four years of job growth at last year's rate for the labor market to return to its level from 2007 before the Financial Crisis.

In Brussels, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said his nation is close to reaching an agreement with its troika of creditors deemed necessary to unlock critical aid that could allow it to stave off bankruptcy. The two sides have begun the process of drafting a technical level agreement on a comprehensive bailout package, according to Athens officials. 
""We have made many steps. We are on the final stretch towards a positive deal,"" Tsipras told reporters."" 
EUR/USD gained 0.0031 or 0.29% to 1.0905 placing the brakes on an extended skid over the last 10 sessions. Previously, the euro had fallen sharply from a three-month high of 1.1467 on May 15, as the possibility of a 2015 interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve coincided with heightened concern of a Greek departure from the European Union. 
A deal in the four-month stalemate could free up the remaining €7.2 billion of a 240 billion bailout euro zone creditors have provided to the cash-strapped Mediterranean nation. Greece is in desperate need of the stimulus package as it reportedly grows closer to running out of cash by the day. Before the deadline to reach an agreement expires at the end of June, Greece owes approximately €1.6 billion to the International Monetary Fund over several payments due next month. 
Greek officials believe a deal can be reached without making concessions for pension and wage cuts, according to multiple reports. The austerity measures, however, were presumed to be a prerequisite for reaching any accord. Officials from the European Commission, meanwhile, painted a different picture on the developments of negotiations. 
“We are working very intensively to ensure a staff-level agreement,"" European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters. ""We're still not there yet."" 
On Wednesday afternoon, shares on the Greek Stock Market soared at the prospects of a deal. 
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.0862, the low from May 26 and was met with resistance at 1.1181, the high from May 21.

EUR/USD fell to an intra-day low of 1.0863, its lowest level since April 28, before slightly rebounding to settle at 1.0879, down 0.0099 or 0.90%. The pair traded in a wide range of 1.0863 and 1.0981 on a choppy day of trading.

While U.S. durable goods orders fell slightly by 0.5% in April, the decline was less sharp than a projected 0.6% loss by analysts. The figure was tamped down by a 4% decline in commercial airlines and 3.4% dip in computer orders. A reading of core orders, however, which excludes volatile bookings of airplane and auto orders, rose by 0.5% last month, above expectations of a 0.4% gain. Last month's rebound could be attributed solely to a surge in airplane orders after transportation procurements spiked by 15.2%. In March, the core reading fell by 0.2% month-to-month and by nearly 2% on a yearly basis.
Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Department of Commerce said new home sales in April rose 6.8% to a seasonally-adjusted 517,000. The gains fell in line with analysts' forecasts of a 485,000 to 540,000 increase for the month.

Investors continued to digest a speech by Yellen last Friday in Providence. In an address to the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce, Yellen said the Federal Open Market Committee believes that inflation will move toward its targeted goal of 2%, as crude prices continue to stabilize and transitory factors weighing on the economy continue to recede.
Meanwhile, euro zone officials said a group of deputy finance ministers would hold a teleconference on Thursday after the conclusion of several days of talks between Greece and its troika of creditors. Additionally, a senior German official told Reuters there was no reason to believe that Greece would fail to meet a €300 million payment to the International Monetary Fund on June 5. By the end of June, however, Greece owes the IMF three other payments totaling more than €1.262 billion.

1512,By Investing.com,"<span>May 22, 2015 06:16PM ET</span>","EUR/USD continues slump, as Yellen expects Fed to hike interest rates","Investing.com -- The dollar continued its recent rally against the euro finishing higher against its European counterpart for the first time in five weeks, amid mixed U.S. consumer pricing data and comments from key central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic on the short-term outlook of both economies.
EUR/USD closed the week at 1.1014, after ending Friday's session down 0.0099 or 0.89%. The dollar appreciated significantly against the euro on the week, gaining nearly 3% after the pair opened on Monday at 1.1444. EUR/USD has now fallen in five of the last six sessions.
The pair plunged from a near intra-day high of 1.1175 to a near session-low of 1.1016 within a span of 90 minutes during U.S. morning trading. The first major announcement came around 8:30 EST when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said its headline Consumer Price Index gained 0.1% in April from the previous month, falling slightly below economists' forecasts. Over the last 12 months, the CPI-U all items index is down by 0.2%.
A reading of the less volatile Core CPI Index, which excludes food and energy prices, was ostensibly less deflationary. The Core CPI rose 0.3% for the month, its highest gain since January, 2013, and 1.8% on a year-over-year basis. The deflationary pressures could be attributed almost entirely to a sharp drop in energy prices. The Federal Reserve would like to see inflation move toward its targeted goal of 2% on an annual basis before it institutes its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade.
Shortly thereafter, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi emphasized the importance of enacting structural reforms with the European economy during a speech in Sintra, Portugal. Draghi indicated that the reforms have the potential to permanently and positively impact the supply-side of the economy.
""They lift the path of potential output, either by raising the inputs to production – the supply and quality of labor and the amount of capital per worker – or by ensuring that those inputs are used more efficiently, i.e. by raising total factor productivity (TFP),"" Draghi said. ""And second, they make economies more resilient to economic shocks by facilitating price and wage flexibility and the swift reallocation of resources within and across sectors.""
Hours later, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said that an interest rate hike will be appropriate at some point in 2015, if there are continual improvements in the U.S. economy. Speaking at a luncheon at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce, Yellen indicated that the U.S. economy appears well-positioned for continued growth as transitory factors from a colder than usual winter and a West Coast port labor dispute start to fade.
While the dollar inched up following Yellen's speech, her address had little impact on the EUR/USD pair. Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries rose by roughly two basis points on Friday to end the session at 2.215%. Bond markets typically rally when the CPI moves higher."

GBP/USD was up 0.83% to 1.5664 from around 1.5600 before the data.
The Office for National Statistics said retail sales rose 1.2% last month, boosted by higher sales of clothing and footwear, far more than forecasts for a 0.4% increase.
Retail sales were 4.7% higher on a year-over-year basis, ahead of expectations for a 3.8% increase.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, were up 1.2% last month, compared to forecasts for a 0.3% rise, after gaining 0.2% in March.
The ONS also said average store prices were lower for the tenth consecutive month, down 3.2% from a year earlier.
Data earlier in the week showed that the U.K. entered into negative inflation in April for the first time since 1960, with the annual rate of inflation falling 0.1% after remaining flat in the previous two months.
However, the Bank of England has said that record low inflation rates are not likely to continue for long and that consumer prices will pick up notably towards the end of the year.

New Zealand hoped to become one of the first developed nations to return to a surplus following the 2008 global financial crisis. That would allow it to begin repaying debt.

On a positive note, deflationary pressures remained relatively strong, with both input and output prices continuing to decline, leaving plenty of scope for the authorities to implement further stimulus measures if required.""The People's Bank of China has cut interest rates three times since November last year to keep the economy on track.Earlier, an inflation survey for May by the Melbourne Institute showed inflation expectations for Australian consumers up slightly in May.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.10% to 95.56.Overnight, the dollar remained broadly higher against a basket of other major currencies on Wednesday, as the previous session's upbeat U.S. data fuelled optimism over the strength of the economy and as markets eyed the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy statement.The greenback strengthened after the U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday that the number of building permits issued last month increased by 10.1% last month to 1.143 million units from March's total of 1.038 million.The report also showed that U.S. housing starts soared by 20.2% in April to hit 1.135 million units from March's total of 944,000 units, easily surpassing expectations for an increase of 9.9%.The single currency weakened as Athens was still scrambling to reach an agreement with its international lenders over economic reforms they say must be implemented before the final €7.2 billion tranche of the country's €240 billion bailout is released.Greece is due to make a €305 million payment to the International Monetary Fund on June 5, but will default if a deal is not reached by then.The euro was also hit after senior European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure said on Tuesday that the central bank is planning to speed up the pace of its bond-buying stimulus program before the summer in order to avoid the ""notably lower market liquidity"" in late July and August.

Federal Reserve officials believed it would be premature to hike interest rates in June even though most felt the U.S. economy was set to rebound from a dismal start to the year, according to minutes from their April policy meeting released on Wednesday.
The central bank debated whether a slew of disappointing data, including weak consumer spending, signaled a temporary slump or evidence of a longer-lasting slowdown, with most participants agreeing economic growth would climb to a healthier pace and the labor market would strengthen.

The U.S. economy grew an anemic 0.1 percent in the first quarter, according to the most recent government data.

The minutes from the April 28-29 policy-setting committee meeting also highlighted the quandary the Fed faces in trying to avoid the market volatility tied to a rate hike while sticking to its meeting-by-meeting guidance on when that move will come.

With an increased amount of uncertainty and signs of softness across the economy, the minutes showed Fed officials pushing the prospect of a rate hike later into the year.

""Many participants, however, thought it unlikely that the data available in June would provide sufficient confirmation that the conditions for raising (interest rates) had been satisfied ...,"" the minutes said.

U.S. Treasury prices were largely unchanged after the release of the minutes, while short-term interest rate futures and TIPS inflation break-even rates held firm, as did stocks.

Fed officials flagged a number of concerns including disappointment that falling oil prices did not spur consumer spending as much as had been hoped. They also cited economic worries in China and Greece.

They also were troubled by the behavior of the bond market, which Fed Chair Janet Yellen spoke about earlier this month. The minutes show central bank officials believe bond market volatility was higher now because of high-frequency traders, decreased inventories of bonds held by broker-dealers, and elevated assets of bond funds.

To avoid a disruptive spike in long-term bond rates, Fed officials discussed whether the central bank should better telegraph a rate hike in post-meeting communications. But most said keeping to the meeting-by-meeting policy was best for now.

The ""taper tantrum"" of 2013, when emerging-market currencies and stocks plunged en masse on the suggestion that Fed bond-buying could be reduced, has loomed over the central bank as it nears its so-called rate lift-off.

The minutes largely reflected the Fed's April policy statement, which pointed to economic softness but described the slow growth as reflecting, in part, transitory factors such as bad weather and a U.S. port disruption.

Investors now will focus on a Yellen speech on Friday for signs of whether she believes the economy is back on track, or if she nods to the latest batch of weak data.

1535,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2015 05:52PM ET</span>","EUR/USD slips under 1.11 as Fed rate hike, Greece remain in focus","Investing.com -- The dollar reached its highest level against the euro during the month of May, as the Federal Reserve provided further indications that it will wait past June before raising its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
EUR/USD continued its steady decline this week, extending its losing streak to a fourth consecutive session, as the currency pair fell to its lowest level since April 29. EUR/USD rose to 1.1135 at 2:15 EST, 15 minutes after the Fed released its minutes from its April FOMC meeting, before see-sawing during the remainder of U.S. afternoon trading. The pair settled at 1.1094, down 0.44%, marking the first time it closed under 1.11 during the month of May.
When the Federal Open Market Committee last met in late-April, only a few of its members supported a June rate hike, according to the minutes released on Wednesday. At the same time, the majority of the FOMC rejected issuing an explicit warning of a rate hike in the statement of the meeting in the month prior to when it decides to institute a rate hike.
Earlier, the pair slipped below 1.11 during European afternoon trading as Greek officials intensified pressure on its euro zone creditors to reach an accord by the end of the month. In Athens, Greece said it will run out of cash in the coming weeks unless it reaches a deal with its creditors before it owes approximately €1.5 billion in payments to the International Monetary Fund next month. Negotiations have stalled as Greece has been unwilling to roll back pension and labor reform measures the creditors have deemed necessary to unlock the final €7.2 billion tranche of the nation's €240 billion bailout.
While yields on Greek 10-Year bonds increased by 13 basis points on the session to 10.86%, they are still down more than 210 basis points on the month -- underscoring investors' skepticism that the beleaguered nation can avoid a default. Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries, meanwhile, fell four basis points on the day to 2.25%, as the Fed's release had little impact on government bond prices.
The FOMC reiterated that it will take a ""data-driven"" approach to lift-off when it is reasonably confident it has seen significant improvements in the economy. The Fed also blamed weak first quarter GDP growth on ""largely transitory factors"" such as severe winter weather and a West Coast port slowdown that dented exports. Historically, economic growth has been comparatively weak in the first quarter in recent years, the FOMC added.
Still, the Fed is confident the economy can rebound over the second quarter due to low interest rates, high consumer confidence and rising real income among average American workers. The Fed remains concerned that interest rates could spike after initial lift-off, citing the possibility of an increased role of high frequency trading, decreases in inventories held by broker-dealers and the potential for higher assets in bond funds.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, settled at 95.68 at Wednesday's close, up 0.28 or 0.33%. The index stood at 95.66, 15 minutes before the FOMC release."

EUR/USD dipped more than 1.5% during Tuesday's session to an intraday low of 1.112, its lowest level since May 5. Although the pair rebounded slightly in U.S. afternoon trading to 1.115, it still experienced its largest one-day sell-off since late-March.
EUR/USD likely gained support at 1.1070, the low from April 30 and was met with resistance at 1.1384, the high from May 13.
In Europe, the euro fell precipitously hours after ECB member Benoît Coeuré outlined an effort by the central bank to frontload asset purchasing of government bonds at the start of the summer. Speaking at the Imperial College Business School/Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis in London, Coeuré said Monday night that the ECB will increase its purchase of European Asset-Backed Securities in May and June to offset a seasonal lack of liquidity.
Coeuré emphasized the additional stimulus measures are related more to seasonal market conditions than the recent sell-off of government bonds in the euro zone. 
""We are aware of seasonal patterns in fixed-income market activity with the traditional holiday period from mid-July to August characterized by notably lower market liquidity,"" Coeuré said during the speech.""If need be, the front loading may be complemented by some back loading in September when market liquidity is expected to improve again. The slightly higher purchase volume that market analysts may observe in the coming weeks is therefore unrelated to the recent episode of market volatility.""
The €1.1 trillion initiative is intended to stimulate corporate borrowing and economic expansion but is not expected to drive interest rates lower. Following the release of Coeuré's prepared remarks on Tuesday morning, yields on 10-year sovereign debt throughout the euro zone moved broadly lower. Yields on Germany 10-Year bunds fell five basis points to 0.59%, while yields on Spanish 10-Year and Italian 10-Year bonds declined by roughly eight basis points each, pushing the coupons on both below 1.82%.
In the U.S., new residential construction for the month of April soared to its highest level since 2007, bolstered by a spike in multi-family starts. The U.S. Department of Commerce said Tuesday that housing starts last month surged more than 20% for the month to 1.135 million, one of its highest on record. The reading far exceeded the high end of analysts' forecasts, which hovered in a range of 0.97 to 1.120 million.
Similarly, the number of new U.S. housing permits soared last month by more than 10% to 1.143 million representing its largest gain in more than seven years. Permits for multi-family units rose by 20.5% to 0.477 million, while multi-family starts swelled by more than 25% to 0.402 million. It was also a strong month for single-family starts, which expanded by 16.7% on the month and 14.7% year-over-year to 0.733 million.
As a result, the dollar extended gains from one session earlier by jumping more than 1% on Tuesday. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 1.1% in U.S. morning trading to an intraday high of 95.55, its highest level in more than two weeks.
Investors await the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes from its April meeting on Wednesday for more clues on the timing of a much-anticipated interest rate hike. A wave of soft U.S. economic data since the FOMC's meeting in March has fueled speculation that the Fed could delay lift-off from June until September or even December.

The index is still up nine points on a year-over-year basis from a 45 reading last May. Any reading over 50, however, is viewed as a signal that builders are highly confident in the current condition of the housing market. The NAHB index has remained over 50 since last July.

EUR/USD stood at 1.1446 at Friday's close, up 0.33%, rallying from session-lows of 1.1324 as currency traders locked into gains from earlier this week when the euro soared to a three-month high. The euro ended the week up 2.25% against its U.S. counterpart and has gained roughly 7% over the last month.
While EUR/USD is up nearly 9% after touching down to 12-year lows near 1.04 in mid-March, the euro is still down more than 5.15% against the dollar since the start of the year when it stood at 1.2104.
Consumer confidence, one of the lone bright spot in the U.S. economy in recent weeks, appears to have peaked. On Friday, the University of Michigan reported that its Consumer Sentiment Index plunged to 88.6, far below low consensus estimates of a 93.5 reading. In terms of current conditions, the survey indicated a drop of 7.2% to 99.8, the lowest level since October. Consumer expectations are comparatively bleak, falling 7.3% from the last reading to 81.5, the worst level in five months.
The downbeat survey comes days after the U.S. Census Bureau reported little change in consumer spending throughout the nation. U.S. retail sales remained flat in April below economists' forecasts of a 0.2 gain. Hawkish policy makers at the Federal Reserve had pointed to strong consumer sentiments and seasonally-affected drags in spending as signals of an improving economy. The downbeat data, however, could appease the doves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in favor of a delayed interest rate hike.
Last month, the FOMC removed all calendar references to the timing of its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. While San Francisco Fed president John Williams said earlier this week that a June rate hike still remains on the table, it is becoming increasingly likely that the Fed will that the Fed will wait until September or even December before raising its benchmark Fed Funds Rate above its current level of zero to 0.25%.
At the same time, the University of Michigan indicated that inflation expectations are going up in large part to increases in energy prices. Inflation expectations over the next year increased 0.3% to 2.9%, according to the consumer survey. The Fed would like to see inflation move toward its targeted goal of 2% annually before it increases interest rates.
Investors await the release of next week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) for further indications on the state of the economy. Although the CPI gained 0.2% in March after falling sharply in January, it was still 0.1% lower on a year-over-year basis. Bond markets typically rally when there are increases in the CPI.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries plunged nine basis points to 2.148% on Friday, while yields on 30-Year Treasuries plummeted 11 basis points to 2.935%. Earlier in the week, 10-year Treasuries soared to a six-month high at 2.36% and the 30-year moved above 3% for the first time this year amid a rout in the global bond markets.
In Europe, yields on German 10-Year bunds fell eight basis points to 0.62%. Yields on Italian and Spanish 10-Year bonds, meanwhile, each fell more than eight basis points to 1.76% and 1.72% respectively. On Tuesday, a massive sell-off in the European bond markets pushed the yields on the sovereign debt above 1.8%. Bond prices fall when yields increase. Over the last month, yields on 10-year German, Spanish and Italian bonds are all up by more than 45 basis points.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, remained weak falling to a four-month low at 93.17.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2015 09:27PM ET</span>",Trade supporters breathe easier as U.S. trade bill clears Senate hurdle,"By Richard Cowan and Krista Hughes
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 12-nation Pacific trade agreement cleared a crucial test in the U.S. Senate on Thursday, giving a resounding thumbs-up to legislation that holds the key to President Barack Obama's diplomatic pivot to Asia.
Just two days after Democrats defied Obama to block debate on a bill to ""fast-track"" trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal through Congress, the Senate voted 65 to 33 to move ahead with consideration of the measure.
Strong support for the bill on this second go-round suggests senators are unlikely to reject the bill, although heated debate is still expected in the Senate over amendments and later in the House of Representatives, where many Democrats staunchly oppose the TPP on fears trade liberalization will cost U.S. jobs.
The about-face came after Democrats won a separate vote on a bill punishing countries that manipulate their currencies to keep their exports cheap, and followed a renewed round of personal lobbying by Obama, who played down differences with left-wing Democrats.
Thirteen of 44 Democrats joined with Republicans, who voted in lock-step to give backers of the legislation more than the 60 votes needed to proceed in the 100-member Senate. 
Under fast-track, the U.S. Congress can approve or reject trade deals such as the TPP deal, but it cannot amend the contents of the pact, a centerpiece of Obama's strategy to counter China's rising economic and diplomatic clout in Asia.
Obama's aggressive defense of fast-track has put him at odds with the left wing of the Democratic Party, pitting him against Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading liberal voice. 
The president thanked senators who backed the bill while vowing to keep trying to convince others, and said his difference of opinion with Warren ""has never been personal."" ID:nW1N0XD036]
""These are folks whose values are completely aligned with mine,"" Obama told reporters. ""This just comes down to a policy difference and analysis in terms of what we think is best for our people, our constituents.""
CURRENCY CLASH LOOMS
The Senate is expected to debate amendments to the fast-track bill next week and Republican Senator Rob Portman, a former U.S. Trade Representative, said he would seek to write sanctions against currency manipulators into trade deals, a move backed by U.S. automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
The White House, which has warned such sanctions would derail the TPP, has so far side-stepped a clash by convincing Democrats to isolate currency rules into a separate customs bill. That passed the Senate with the support of all Democrats and more than half the chamber's Republicans.
Portman said he would also seek to include those rules - allowing import duties against currency cheats - into fast-track itself.
Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said action on currency might be needed as a sweetener for fast-track in the House, where many Democrats say labor and environmental protections fall short and some conservative Republicans oppose any more power for Obama.
""There's a broad feeling we have to do something against China,"" Schumer said. Many lawmakers blame China's trade gains on an overly-weak Chinese currency.
Obama said he had spoken to Schumer and other lawmakers concerned about currency manipulation on finding language that would not have a ""blow-back"" effect on U.S. monetary policy.
House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, said any attempt to legislate currency levels would be ""laughable,"" signaling that Republicans, who have a majority in the House, would push strongly against currency rules. 
Passage is already far from assured, with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi voicing concerns of her own.
The fast-track bill would effectively give Obama and his successor six years to negotiate additional trade deals that could not be amended by Congress. ""I would hope there could be some addressing of the length of time,"" Pelosi told reporters.
The TPP would create a free trade zone covering 40 percent of the world economy. Trading partners have said they want to see the legislation enacted before finalizing the pact - a task the administration wants to complete this year.

The Senate also passed a bill extending duty-free access to U.S. markets for African and other developing nations.

EUR/USD jumped to a session-high of 1.144, its highest-level since Feb. 5, before falling back to 1.1408 in U.S. afternoon trading, up 0.44%. While the euro is still down more than 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, it is up nearly 6% since falling to 1.0764 on April 1.
The release of weaker than expected U.S. inflation data on Thursday, bolstered dovish views of a delayed interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. In a monthly report, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said that Producer Prices for total final demand in April fell 0.4%, significantly below estimates of a 0.1% -- the low end of analysts' forecasts. On a year-over-year basis, Thursday's reading painted an even dire outlook as the index ticked down to a record low of minus 1.3%. In March, the index stood at negative 0.8% in comparison with the reading 12 months earlier.
A key reading of the Producer Price Index, the PPI-FD, which excludes food and energy prices, dipped 0.2% in April. Analysts expected the reading to remain flat on the low end of its forecasts. The PPI-FD is still up 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The moderate inflationary pressures, in combination with disappointing import and export data a day earlier will probably appease the doves on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
A day earlier, the Labor Department said import prices slid 0.3% in April, following a 0.2% decline a month earlier. On a year-over-year basis, import prices have fallen by more than 10% after the 10th consecutive monthly decline. Following the conclusion of its April meeting on Apr. 29, the Fed reiterated that it would like to see inflation move toward its targeted goal of 2% before it raises interest rates for the first time since 2006. On Mar. 18, the euro spiked by more than 2.5% against the dollar after Fed chair Janet Yellen's relatively dovish comments on the state of the economy.
On Wednesday, the euro soared more than 1.25% in response to strong GDP growth in the euro zone during the first quarter. Euro zone GDP rose by 0.4% in the first three months of the year, expanding at its fasted pace in nearly two years. Growth was particularly strong in France and Italy, which expanded at rates of 0.6% and 0.3% respectively. The spread between U.S. 10-Year Treasuries and German 10-Year bunds continued to narrow, falling on Thursday to just under 155 basis points.

In another report the Labor Department said the producer price index fell 0.4% last month and was 1.3% lower on a year-over-year basis, the largest drop since 2010.

Since last April, retail sales have edged up only 0.9%, the lowest level dating back to late 2009.
The readings provide signals of modest inflationary pressures, augmenting the positions of the doves at the Federal Reserve, who have taken a cautious approach to the timing of its first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. Last month, the FOMC removed all calendar references to the timing of a potential hike. While it appears increasingly likely that the Fed will wait until September or even December before raising its benchmark Fed Funds Rate from its current level of zero to 0.25%, the FOMC still has not taken a June rate hike off the table.

1613,By Investing.com,"<span>May 12, 2015 05:43PM ET</span>","EUR/USD ends four-session losing streak, as bond rout roils markets","Investing.com -- The euro appreciated sharply against the dollar on Tuesday ending a four-session losing streak, as the global bond rout roiled markets for the second straight day.
EUR/USD surged to a session-high of 1.1278 in European morning trading, before currency traders pared some of their gains in U.S. afternoon trading as the pair fell slightly to 1.212, up 0.0975 or 0.51%.
In Europe, yields on 10-Year German bunds soared more than a dozen basis points to 0.73%, extending Monday's sell-off when they rose six basis points from 0.54 to 0.60. Despite ending Tuesday's session slightly lower at 0.68%, the yields still moved more than 14% on the day. Yields on government debt increase when bond prices decrease.
Yields on France 10-Year bonds, meanwhile, rose nine basis points to 0.99% and are now up by 56 basis points over the last month. Bond prices in Italian and Spanish sovereign debt continued to plunge, as the 10-year yields gained 10 and 13 basis points respectively to 1.86 and 1.87%.
As investors departed from a crowded trade in 10-year bunds, they sought refuge in the euro early in Tuesday's session causing the currency to spike against its American counterpart. The euro also received support from positive developments in the Greek debt crisis, after news broke that Athens repaid a €750 million loan to the International Monetary Fund in full before Tuesday's deadline.
Earlier this spring, yields on European sovereign debt fell to record-lows after the start of the European Central Bank's ambitious €60 billion a month quantitative easing program. The yield on 10-year German bunds, for instance, nearly fell into negative territory in late-April before rebounding over the last two weeks. A rise in inflation expectations, surging oil prices and a lack of liquidity in global bond markets is believed to have caused the massive sell-off.
The sell-off spilled into U.S. bond markets on Monday, as yields on 30-Year Treasuries moved above 3% for the first time in 2015 and the yield curve between 5-Year and 30-year Treasuries moved to its steepest level since late last year. On Tuesday, yields on 10-Year Treasuries reached a six-month high at 2.36%, before falling back 10 basis points at the close.
The bond squeeze impacted currencies in Asia, as the Indonesian rupiah fell to its lowest level against the dollar in decades while the Indian rupee dropped to a yearly-low. USD/IDR rose to 13,160 on Tuesday, up more than 1.5% since mid-April. Meanwhile, USD/INR surged to 64.146, up nearly 3% since the start of April.

In Brussels, meanwhile, there are still concerns that Greece could default on its sovereign debt and leave the EU following the conclusion of lengthy negotiations on Monday. While Eurogroup chair Jeroen Dijsselbloem applauded Greece's renewed efforts at accelerating negotiations, he emphasized that more time is needed to reach a comprehensive agreement. Greece, however, is running out of time to strike a deal with its troika of creditors for a critical stimulus package needed to stave off bankruptcy. In late-June, a four-month extension from Greece's euro zone creditors dubbed the ""Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement,"" otherwise known as the Greek bailout, will expire.
""The Eurogroup today took stock of the state of play with the ongoing negotiations between Greek authorities and the institution. We welcomed the progress that has been achieved so far. We note the reorganization and streamlining of working procedures has made an acceleration possible and has contributed to a more substantial deal. At the same time, we acknowledged that more time and effort are needed to bridge the gaps on the remaining open issues,"" the Eurogroup leaders said in a statement.
European Union commissioner Pierre Moscovici said while significant convergence had been achieved on some issues such as determining rates for Value-Added Taxes and on how to handle non-performing loans, the sides still remained apart on determining reform measures in the Greek labor market and with its pension system.

For the week, the pair jumped 1.03%, the fifth straight weekly gain.The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 223,000 new jobs in April, just below expectations for jobs growth of 224,000. March’s figure was revised down to just 85,000 from a previously reported gain of 126,000.The unemployment rate fell from 5.5% to a near seven-year low of 5.4% last month, broadly in line with forecasts.The U.S. dollar initially rallied following the data, before giving back some gains, as traders focused on the negative details of the jobs report. The dollar index rose to a session peak of 95.17, before trimming gains to settle at 94.91 by late Friday, up 0.18%. On Wednesday, the index slumped to an 11-week low of 93.95.Recent economic reports have indicated that the U.S. economy has slowed since the start of the year, prompting many investors to push back expectations on the timing of an initial rate hike by the Fed to late-2015, instead of midyear.Meanwhile, in Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its outlook for growth and inflation for 2015 and 2016 on Friday, saying the economy will continue to expand at a subpar rate for a longer than expected period. On Thursday, official data showed that the number of employed people in Australia declined by 2,900 in April, compared to expectations for an increase of 5,000. The report also showed that Australia's unemployment rate rose to 6.2% last month from 6.1% in March.The tepid data came after the RBA lowered its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 2.00% from 2.25% on Tuesday. RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said the decision came despite some ""improved trends in household demand over the past six months and stronger growth in employment"" and cited some ongoing weakness in business capital expenditure and public spending.Elsewhere, China reported a trade surplus of $34.1 billion in April on Friday, below expectations for a surplus of $39.5 billion.

1647,By Investing.com,"<span>May 08, 2015 05:17PM ET</span>","EUR/USD falls slightly as UK election, U.S. jobs report have little sway","Investing.com -- EUR/USD fell slightly on Friday by roughly 0.5% as a surprising result in the UK general election and a mixed U.S. jobs report had little impact on the currency pair.
The euro stood at 1.1202 at Friday's close, down 0.0064 or 0.57%. For the week, the pair remained in a tight range between 1.11 and 1.1373 during a less volatile stretch than a host of others throughout a choppy spring. Last week, for instance, the euro gained roughly 3% amid heightened expectations of a delayed interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
The U.S. Department of Labor said on Friday that nonfarm payrolls for the month of April increased by 223,000, slightly above forecasts for a 220,000 gain. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell by 0.1% to 5.4%, its lowest level since May, 2008 before the Financial Crisis. Nonfarm payrolls for March were also revised downward to 85,000 from an already paltry reading of 126,000.
Reaction in currency markets, however, was generally muted as the pair rose modestly to 1.1247, 30 minutes after the release on Friday morning. By comparison, the euro plunged 1.70% to 1.0844 on Mar. 6 when a strong U.S. employment report signaled the possibility of a sooner than expected rate hike. In addition, the euro surged by 2.54% back to 1.0866 on Mar. 18 after relatively dovish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen on the state of the economy fueled speculation of a delayed lift-off.
Last week, the Fed reiterated its data-driven approach to its first potential rate hike since 2006 by removing all calendar references to the timing of lift-off. Wary of a premature rate hike, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would like to see significant improvements with wage growth and upward movements in inflation toward its target goal of 2% before it decides to raise rates. While average hourly rates inched up by 1% in April, they have risen by 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' released its Employment Cost Index last week, it reported a slight uptick in wage pressures.
Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate edged up 0.1% to 62.8% in April spurred by gains in professional and business services, healthcare and construction industries. The number of workers marginally attached to the labor force remained relatively unchanged over the past year, ticking down from 2.16 million in April, 2014 to 2.115 million last month. The reading is a gauge on the number of workers who have sought employment in the last 12 months, but stopped actively looking for work over the last four weeks.
In addition, there were 6.6 million part-time workers throughout the country in April, down from 7.4 million 12 months ago. The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader reading of the nation's labor condition, measures the total amount of unemployed Americans along with marginally attached and part-time workers. During testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in February, Fed chair Janet Yellen said the picture of the nation's labor condition was ""less rosy,"" when the U-6 unemployment rate was examined.
A disappointing jobs report on Friday may convince the Fed to take a June rate hike off the table. The Fed may opt to wait until September or even December to increase its benchmark Fed Funds Rate.
In the United Kingdom prime minister David Cameron surprisingly posted a resounding victory on Thursday night in the British general election, as his Conservative party added 28 seats to boost its majority to 331. Throughout the year, polls indicated the possibility of a hung parliament in which no party would gain majority control. Cameron promised voters a referendum on the UK's membership in the European Union if elected.
The results boosted the pound, as GBP/USD gained 1.39% to close the week at 1.5456.
Yields on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries fell roughly three basis points to 2.15, one day after moving above 2.3% to reach a two-month high. Yields on German 10-Year bunds fell four basis points to 0.54%.

The Greek sovereign debt crisis and the timing of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve remained in focus, as the euro continued to retreat away from parity with its American counterpart. A wave of analysts had forecasted parity for some point in 2016 back in early-March when the euro fell to a 12-year low at 1.0456. Since then, however, the euro is up more than 8.5% after settling on Wednesday at 1.11349.
EUR/USD hit a high of 1.1370 on Wednesday above a session-low of 1.1176 on a choppy day of trading. The pair likely gained support at 1.1121 the low from May 4 and met resistance at 1.1415, the high from Feb. 23.
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen created a mild sell-off in U.S. markets when she sent warning signals of the potential dangers that could ensue from high valuations in equities markets. Speaking at the Institute for New Economic Thinking's Finance and Society conference in Washington, Yellen cited the scant returns in government debt due to lower interest rates as a factor for shifting investments into stocks.
On Wednesday, U.S. bonds extended its losing streak to its fourth consecutive session, as the yield on 10-Year Treasuries rose more than seven basis points to 2.252% -- its highest level since early March. Yields on 30-Year Treasuires, meanwhile, rose by 10 basis points to 3.006% to reach a five-month high.
The Fed is hoping to avoid a ""taper tantrum,"" that occurred under Yellen's predecessor Ben Bernanke in 2013 when he hinted that the U.S. central bank could begin reducing the amount of long-term bond purchases it made through its quantitative easing program. Bernanke initiated three rounds of quantitative easing starting in November, 2008, to keep interest rates low in order to stimulate economic growth.
Moreover, Yellen indicated that the Fed is hoping to prevent rapid movements in long and short-term rates.
‘‘We saw this in the case of the taper tantrum in 2013 where there was a very sharp upward movement in rates and you do have divergent monetary policies, potentially around the world,’’ Yellen said.
In Europe, meanwhile, prices on 10-year German bunds and 10-year French bonds rose for the eighth straight session, amid low liquidity. Greece reportedly sold more than €1.13 billion in six-month T-Bills, liquidating the full amount it had sought to raise in two auctions in May. Athens also made a modest interest payment to the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday, ahead of a larger €751.61 million payment due on May 11.

EUR/USD rose 0.0039 or 0.35% to 1.1186 in U.S. afternoon trading, after falling to a session-low of 1.1066 on a choppy session Tuesday.

The uncertainty surrounding Greece has sent yields on sovereign debt throughout Europe skyrocketing in recent days. On Tuesday, yields on 10-year Italian, 10-year Spanish and 10-year Portuguese all rose by more than 25 basis points on the session.

The widening of the trade deficit has led to rising concern of a contraction in the economy in the first quarter.

EUR/USD fell 0.0051 or 0.46% to 1.1148 on Monday in U.S. afternoon trading, as the dollar posted mild gains against its European counterpart for the third consecutive session. The pair peaked at a session-high of 1.1224 in European morning trading, before falling to a daily low of 1.1122 on a choppy day of trading. 
EUR/USD had been in a holding pattern between 1.05 and 1.10 since mid-March until the euro rallied significantly against the dollar early last week. The pair likely gained support at 1.0858 the low from April 28 and met resistance at 1.1291 the high from May 1.
On Monday, the U.S. Census Bureau said in a monthly report that factory orders for the month of April soared 2.1%, above estimates of a 2.0% gain. Bolstered by a surge in aircraft, motor vehicle and energy equipment orders, the reading posted its first gain in eight months. In March, U.S. factory orders fell slightly by 0.1%, underscoring crashing oil prices and a dip in exports due to the stronger dollar.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve of Atlanta's GDP Now model forecast growth of 0.8% for the second quarter, amid a decline in nonresidential structures investment by approximately 20%. The forecasts fall dramatically below consensus estimates of 3.3% for the period. For the first quarter, the Atlanta Fed predicted a paltry gain of 0.2%, in line with actual figures released last week.
The pair remained relatively unchanged following a speech by Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans early on Monday afternoon. Delivering a speech in Columbus, Indiana, Evans reiterated that the Fed should wait until 2016 before it decides to raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
“Economic activity appears to be on a solid, sustainable growth path, which, on its own, would support a rate hike soon,” Evans said. ""However, the weak first-quarter data do give me pause, and I would like to see confirmation that they are indeed a transitory aberration.""
Following the Federal Open Market Committee's April meeting last week, the Fed removed all calendar references to the timing of an interest rate hike, pinning the monetary policy shift on a data-driven approach. Two days later, Federal Reserve of Cleveland president Loretta Mester acknowledged though that June is still on the table for lift off. Evans is favoring a more cautious approach. 
“I see significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely,” Evans added.
In Europe, Markit said in its Manufacturer's PMI for April that France and Greece produced readings of below 50.0 for the month, demonstrating an accelerated decline in factory production.
