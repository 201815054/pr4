 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro fell sharply against
the dollar while the yen rallied on Wednesday after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke expressed concern about the U.S.
economy and dampened risk appetite.
 Bernanke, in testimony prepared for delivery to the Senate
Banking Committee, said the U.S. economy faces ""unusually
uncertain"" prospects and the central bank was ready to take
further steps to bolster growth if needed. For more, see
The comments pushed the euro down more than 1 percent versus
both the dollar and yen as worries about the health of the
global economy spurred investors into the safe-haven U.S. and
Japanese currencies.
 ""The market was looking for some form of concrete action
from Bernanke, a commitment to do something. All we got was
that they're aware of the risks and are prepared to take as yet
unspecified actions,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 ""Reaction is basically turning into a spasm of despair,"" he
added. ""In FX, the yen crosses are your real indicator of risk
aversion.""
 In late New York trading, the euro was down 1 percent at
$1.2763, after having fallen as low as $1.2732, according to
electronic trading platform EBS.
 Against the yen, the euro fell 1.5 percent to 111.07.
 The dollar fell 0.6 percent to 87.02 yen. The Japanese
currency also surged versus sterling and the Australian and New
Zealand dollars.
 ""If there is a theme to Mr. Bernanke's testimony today it
is uncertainty, over the state of the economy and the likely
path of Fed policy,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist
at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
 STRESS TESTS AHEAD
 Tepid demand at a Portuguese debt sale also weighed on the
euro as it heightened fears about Europe's banks days before
the European Union was due to reveal which ones need to raise
more capital.
 The euro had a good run against the dollar in recent weeks,
rising to a 10-week high above $1.30 on Tuesday as traders
began to bet most of the 91 European banks being examined would
pass their stress tests. The test results are to be released on
Friday.
 European policy makers have expressed confidence their
banks would pass the tests, though some analysts said investors
remain skeptical about the severity of the health checks.
 Major listed banks, which face constant investor scrutiny,
are expected to pass, but the tests may show the worst problems
lie with smaller players such as Spanish cajas and German
landesbanks, which are mainly unlisted.
 UBS currency strategist Amelia Bourdeau said investors are
starting to ""lower their expectations"" for the stress tests,
thus hurting the euro.
 ""Debt stress in the euro zone is not going to disappear
overnight,"" she said.

Representatives approved a bill on Wednesday to help U.S.
manufacturers by suspending import duties on hundreds of raw
materials they use to make finished goods.
 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill, which
received broad bipartisan support, was a preview of a bigger
package Democrats plan to offer in coming weeks to boost
manufacturing jobs.
 ""Democrats know that a strong manufacturing base is key to
our economic revival, and the passage of this bill today is a
good step forward as we continue to create the jobs America
needs,"" Hoyer said.
 The House voted 378 to 43 to approve the U.S. Manufacturing
Enhancement Act, a bipartisan measure previously known as the
Miscellaneous Tariff Bill and passed every few years.
 The Senate also must approve the bill before it can go to
President Barack Obama for his signature.
 Hoyer said the tariff relief provided in the bill was
projected to add billions of dollars to the economy and support
tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs.
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated lost revenue
from the tariff suspensions at $297.8 million through 2012.
 The bill also suspends duties on some foreign goods
containing U.S. inputs.
 The National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce both pressed hard for the bill.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2010 01:44PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Russia must improve IP enforcement to join WTO - US," (Adds more quotes from hearing)
 WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - Russia must improve efforts
to stop piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. music, movies and
other goods to achieve its longterm goal of joining the World
Trade Organization, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.
 ""We have made clear to the Russia government repeatedly
that intellectual property enforcement has to be strengthened
in order for them to enter the WTO,"" Victoria Espinel, the U.S.
intellectual property enforcement coordinator, told the House
of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.
 A few weeks ago, U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev pledged to resolve issues blocking
Russia's WTO accession by the end of September.
 However, the top Republican on House Foreign Affairs
Committee said that timetable was too fast.
 ""Given Russia's history of broken promises, Moscow should
be required to demonstrate a long track record of success prior
to an OK by the U.S. to its joining the WTO,"" said Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican.
 Espinel told committee members she wanted to allay any
concerns that Moscow would get a free pass on intellectual
property enforcement and said U.S. trade officials would be
traveling to Russia in coming weeks to discuss the issue.
 Chris Israel, who held Espinel's position from May 2005 to
March 2008, said meeting the deadline Obama and Medvedev set
would be ""a heavy lift.""
 To comply with a deal the United States and Russia struck
in 2006, Moscow must make a range of criminal, civil and
customs enforcement improvements, he said.
 However, Russia may have more incentive now to take those
steps in light of the country's goal of shifting to a more
innovative and technological economy from one primarily
dependent on natural resource exports, he said.

 * Debt repayment depends on oil prices
 * ""Forget about"" eurobond plans
 
 By Ed Cropley, African Investment Correspondent
 JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Reuters) - Oil-rich Angola's shock
admission that it has $9 billion in unpaid building bills has
sunk any immediate chance of issuing up to $4 billion in foreign
debt but may mark a turning point for its secretive rulers.
 The mess stems from Angola's reliance on oil for more than
80 percent of its official revenues, and the building boom that
has gripped the country, and especially its capital, since a
long civil war ended in 2002.
 When oil prices collapsed in late 2008, revenue dried up but
the construction wave that has turned Luanda into one of the
world's most expensive cities churned on regardless.
 Lots of shiny new soccer stadiums for the African Cup of
Nations soccer tournament in January only made matters worse.
 Even though it produces 1.5 million barrels or more of oil a
day, $9 billion is a large sum for the country of 16 million,
equating to a quarter of the annual budget and nearly two-thirds
of stated foreign exchange reserves.
 A degree of fuzziness with official data is common in most
of frontier Africa, and investors had known for months Angola
had fallen behind with payments to the Portuguese and Brazilian
firms rebuilding after the end of the civil war.
 But the sheer size of the arrears -- around three times
prior estimates -- and the cack-handed nature in which they
became known, with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos putting the
debt at $6.8 billion on Monday only to be trumped by the Finance
Ministry with $9 billion on Tuesday, left outsiders speechless.
 ""Wow. It's shocking. These are huge amounts,"" said Coura
Fall, an African frontier market analyst at Citibank in
Johannesburg. ""They can forget about any eurobond now.""
 ""People are asking questions about the finances. What is the
government revenue on a monthly basis? How much do they owe to
other creditors? Who do you trust?""
 
 CAN PAY, WILL PAY -- EVENTUALLY
 In a rare news conference, dos Santos, who has been in
charge for 30 years, said all debts would be honoured, with
smaller firms being paid in full in two months and larger ones
getting 40 percent this year and the rest ""in one or two years"".
 But his words are unlikely to fill prospective investors
with confidence, especially since the chances of being paid
depend on the direction of oil prices. Another sustained drop
because of a ""double-dip"" world recession would be disastrous.
 ""It would make you think twice about your ability to be
paid,"" said Stuart Culverhouse of London-based brokerage Exotix.
The bond issue, which already appeared to be dropping in
Luanda's priorities, would ""clearly be delayed"", he added.
 However, Alex Vines, an Angola expert at the Chatham House
think-tank in London, said dos Santos' unprecedented admission
suggested there were no other skeletons in the cupboard, and
could usher in the honesty outside investors so crave.
 The Finance Ministry has already decided to impose ""more
rigour and transparency"" on government departments.
 ""The history of Angola is that it does pay -- it's just
quite slow,"" Vines said.
 ""Of course this will be a reality check, but as long as it
turns out to be accurate and isn't the tip of a greater iceberg
of unpaid bills, investors should kind-of welcome this.""
 
 IMF, RATINGS AGENCIES
 The revelations mark a rude return to earth for a country
that sees itself as vying with Nigeria to be Africa's biggest
crude producer, and a future darling of foreign investors with
grand plans for a stock market and issuance of up to $4 billion
in dollar bonds.
What makes it worse is that Luanda, with bond issuance in
mind, had received credit ratings from S&P, Moodys and Fitch in
May with a favourable 'B+' outlook based on strong growth
prospects and low levels of government debt.
 The agencies, though nervous about the secrecy in which dos
Santos' administration cloaks itself, assessed external debt at
18 percent of GDP, or around $18 billion.
 The ratings followed the approval by The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) of a $1.4 billion loan programme last year.
 In an assessment of the economy released in May, the IMF
estimated Angola's 2009 external debt at $14.9 billion, and
under ""external arrears"" -- which should include late payments
to foreign construction firms -- listed a paltry $500 million.
 Yet the revelations of the debts scale was serious enough
for Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva to fly to Luanda
this week to press for payment.

 * Berlin is an ""economic failure"", letting down whole region
 * Lack of skilled workers due to demographic change
 
 By Sarah Marsh and Christina Amann
 BERLIN, July 21 (Reuters) - The economy in former East
Germany will grow more slowly over the coming years than in the
more prosperous west and may never catch up completely, the head
of a leading German research institute told Reuters.
 Nearly 20 years since German reunification, much of the
eastern economy has cast off the shackles of its communist past
thanks in part to over 1 trillion euros in state transfers from
the West. Yet economic output per inhabitant remains stubbornly
lower than in the west and unemployment is high.
 ""The East German economy will not catch up with the West
German one,"" said Ulrich Blum, president of the IWH economic
institute in the eastern city of Halle.
 Berlin was an ""economic failure"", said Blum, also an adviser
to the federal government. If it had the economic strength of a
city like Munich, it could power the entire surrounding region.
 ""As long as Berlin fails to take on its role as capital city
from an economic viewpoint, the East has less of a chance of
catching up,"" he said, noting there were not enough big cities
and firms in the east, where no blue-chip DAX firms are based.
 Saddled with debts of over 60 billion euros, Berlin has one
of the highest jobless rates of any major German city and has
struggled to attract the kind of firms that made the country the
world's biggest goods exporter for much of the past decade.
 The government has said it is aiming for the eastern states
to catch up with the poorest western states by the end of 2019
when the ""Solidarity Pact"", a package of special aid, will end.
 However, there is growing discontent about the Solidarity
Pact because many western cities are sliding deeper and deeper
into debt, partly on account of having to pay for it.
 A failure to close the East-West gap may aggravate political
tensions and make governing Germany harder. Polls have shown the
Left Party, which includes the successors to the communists, has
often been the most popular party across the six eastern states.
 The east German economy was about one-third less
export-reliant than the west, said Blum, given that it was more
focused on intermediate goods and services.
 As a result, it suffered less during the crisis, when the
German economy shrank by some five percent, but would also
benefit less from the pick-up in global demand, he said.
 The IWH has forecast the east German economy to grow 1.5
percent this year as fiscal stimulus packages boost the
construction sector and the services sector picks up.
 The West German economy would grow by 2 percent, however, as
foreign demand bolstered industrial orders and output. Recent
data showed German trade with the rest of the world surged in
May, while industrial output jumped more than expected.
 ""The east German recovery will be 0.3 to 0.4 percentage
points weaker than in the west in the near future,"" said Blum.
 Lack of skilled workers was likely to be a serious problem
in eastern Germany, he added. More older employees were retiring
than young people were entering the workforce, he said.
 ""There are two solutions for this: firstly, we must commit
ourselves to reducing the number of school dropouts,"" said Blum.
""Finally, wages will also have to rise in the future.""

 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the dollar
rose on Wednesday after Apple's robust profits raised hopes
the recovery remains intact, but Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's planned testimony in Congress unnerved investors.
 Optimism that began late on Tuesday after Apple Inc
 announced an unusually upbeat revenue forecast spread
later to Asia and Europe. A raft of U.S. earnings also beat
Wall Street's expectations, bolstering sentiment.
 But U.S. stocks wavered as earnings enthusiasm was

 Investors will be watching for any hint of whether the Fed
will ease monetary policy further now that the U.S. economic
recovery has slowed.

 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Wednesday as tepid demand at a Portuguese debt sale
underscored fears about Europe's banks days before the European
Union was due to reveal which ones need to raise more capital.
 The dollar softened against the yen, though, as markets
braced for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to reassure
Congress on Wednesday that the central bank has the tools to
reinvigorate an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy.
 The euro had a good run against the dollar in recent weeks,
rising to a 10-week high above $1.30 on Tuesday as traders
started betting most of the 91 European banks being examined
would pass their stress tests. The test results are to be
released on Friday.
 But the euro failed to hold above $1.30 on Tuesday, and the
currency fell below $1.28 on Wednesday after Portugal ended up
paying twice as much to borrow 1.25 billion euros in a 12-month
bill auction than it did at its previous sale.
 ""The euro is correcting lower as a result of the Portuguese
auction,"" said Michael Hewson, currency strategist at CMC
Markets. ""It doesn't take much to sow seeds of doubt in the
euro.""
 UBS currency strategist Amelia Bourdeau said investors are
starting to ""lower their expectations"" for the stress tests,
thus hurting the euro. ""Debt stress in the euro zone is not
going to disappear overnight,"" she said.
 The euro was last changing hands at $1.2812, down 0.6
percent, and at 111.85 yen, down 0.7 percent.
 European policy makers have expressed confidence that their
banks would pass the stress tests, though some analysts said
investors remain skeptical about the severity of the tests.
 Earlier, the euro hit a $1.2791 session low. The 50 percent
retracement of the euro's April-to-June, peak-to-trough move
lies at $1.2783, according to Reuters data, while trendline
support drawn from lows hit this month was at $1.2757.
 The dollar fell 0.2 percent to 87.29 yen a day after the
Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the second time in two
months.
 BERNANKE TOPS THE BILL
 The dollar has struggled in recent weeks as a raft of soft
U.S. economic data dashed market expectations of a Fed interest
rate rise in 2011. That has prompted investors to reassess
expected returns on dollar-denominated assets.
 Two-year U.S. Treasuries fell to a record low yield of 0.57
percent on Tuesday, about 20 basis points below the yield on
comparable German debt. Less than a month ago, U.S. notes were
yielding more than German ones.
 In fact, investors have started entertaining the notion
that the Fed could head in the other direction and ease
monetary policy further to perk up a sputtering recovery.
 Analysts said market participants will listen closely to
Bernanke when he begins his two-day, semi-annual testimony
before Congress at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) for any sign that the
Fed intends to boost monetary easing.
 ""Bernanke kicks off a two-day testimony before Congress
today in the full knowledge that the U.S. economy is slowing,""
said BNY Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor. ""What Mr.
Bernanke says, and the way that he says it, really matter.""
 Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at Interactive Brokers'
Group in Greenwich, Connecticut, said, ""No doubt someone will
raise the question today as to whether the Fed could reduce the
deposit rate paid on banks' excess reserves"" to boost lending.
 UBS' Bourdeau said Bernanke is likely to acknowledge recent
signs of weakness in the U.S. economy and downgrade its growth
outlook, which could push the dollar down against the euro.
 But she said that would provide a good opportunity to
reenter euro shorts in anticipation of a renewed euro decline
in the coming months.

(adds detail, background)
 By Dave Graham
 BERLIN, July 21 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
Orban said on Wednesday that he would discuss the upcoming
budget with the European Union but there was no point discussing
long-term issues with the International Monetary Fund.
 Speaking at a news conference with German Chancellor Angela
Merkel in Berlin, Orban said Hungary needed to agree with the EU
-- and not the IMF -- how the country reduces its deficit,
because its agreement with the fund expires in October.
 ""Therefore it makes no sense to negotiate long-term
questions with the IMF,"" Orban said through an interpreter.
 ""We need to reach agreement not with the IMF, but with the
EU, on how we reduce our deficit from 3.8 percent to a level
below 3 percent as expected by the European Union.
 ""We need to negotiate that with the European Union. We will
do that,"" Orban added. ""Our budget for next year we will do with
the European Union in accordance with these negotiations.""
 The forint tumbled more than 3 percent on Monday after talks
between Budapest and the IMF and EU were suspended and Hungary
rebuffed calls for tougher spending cuts.
 The lenders suspended a review of a 20 billion euro funding
agreement signed in October 2008 to avert financial meltdown.
 Orban, who was elected in April, rejected suggestions that
Hungary's budget deficit in 2010 would end up breaching an
agreed target of 3.8 percent of gross domestic product.
 ""I have reassured everyone -- investors and IMF specialists
-- that Hungary will not have a deficit of more than 3.8 percent
by the end of the year,"" he said. ""And with this, our contract
with the IMF runs out. From that moment on, we must no longer
deal with the IMF but with the European Union.""
 Merkel noted that although Hungary was not a member of the
euro zone, as an EU member it also needed to respect the bloc's
budgetary rules limiting deficits to 3 percent of GDP.
 ""I think Hungary has taken very energetic steps in the last
few years to meet the demands of deficit reduction,"" she said.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Wednesday after tepid demand at a Portuguese debt
sale underscored fears about Europe's banks days before the
European Union was due to reveal which ones need to raise more
capital.
 The dollar softened against other major currencies, though,
as markets braced for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to
reassure Congress on Wednesday that the central bank has the
tools to reinvigorate an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy.
 The euro has had a good run against the dollar in recent
weeks, rising to a 10-week high above $1.30 on Tuesday as
investors started betting most of the 91 European banks being
examined would pass their stress tests.
 But investors began taking profits on the euro's rise a day
ago, and the currency neared $1.28 after Portugal ended up
paying twice as much to borrow 1.25 billion euros in a 12-month
bill auction than it did at its previous sale.
 ""The euro is correcting lower as a result of the Portuguese
auction,"" said Michael Hewson, currency strategist at CMC
Markets. ""It doesn't take much to sow seeds of doubt in the
euro.""
 UBS currency strategist Amelia Bourdeau said investors are
staring to ""lower their expectations"" for the stress tests,
thus hurting the euro. ""Debt stress in the euro zone is not
going to disappear overnight,"" she said.
 The euro was last changing hands at $1.2806, down 0.6
percent, and at 111.65 yen, down 1 percent.
 Earlier, the euro hit a $1.2791 session low, just shy of
its 200-hour moving average. The 50-percent retracement of the
euro's April-to-June, peak-to-trough move lies at $1.2783,
according to Reuters data, while trendline support drawn from
lows hit this month was at $1.2757.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 87.17 yen.
 The dollar fell 0.5 percent to C$1.0378 a day after the
Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the second time in a
two months.
 BERNANKE TOPS THE BILL
 The dollar has struggled in recent weeks as a series of
soft U.S. economic data has dashed market expectations of a Fed
interest rate rise in 2011. That has prompted investors to
reassess expected returns on dollar-denominated assets.
 Two-year U.S. Treasuries were yielding a record low 0.57
percent on Tuesday, about 20 basis points below the yield on
comparable German debt. Less than a month ago, U.S. notes were
yielding more than German ones.
 In fact, investors have started entertaining the notion
that the Fed could head in the other direction and ease
monetary policy further to perk up a sputtering recovery.
 Analysts said market participants will listen closely to
Bernanke when he begins his two-day, semi-annual testimony
before Congress at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) for any sign that the Fed
intends to boost monetary easing.
 ""Bernanke kicks off a two-day testimony before Congress
today in the full knowledge that the U.S. economy is slowing,""
said BNY Mellon currency strategist Neil Mellor. ""What Mr.
Bernanke says, and the way that he says it, really matter.""
 Bourdeau said she expects Bernanke to acknowledge recent
signs of weakness in the U.S. economy and downgrade its growth
outlook, which could push the dollar down against the euro.
 But she said that would provide a good opportunity to
reenter euro shorts in anticipation of a renewed euro decline
in the coming months.

 * Govt needs to reform road, railway, port sectors
 * On track to meet overall $500 bln infrastructure target
(Adds quotes, details throughout)
 By Manoj Kumar and Matthias Williams
 NEW DELHI, July 21 (Reuters) - Bureaucratic hurdles may
cause India's government to miss 2012 investment targets in key
sectors such as roads, railways and ports, potentially crimping
economic growth, an adviser to the planning commission said on
Wednesday.
 Slow progress to overhaul India's crumbling infrastructure
has long been seen a drag on growth, as Asia's third-largest
economy looks to match the double digit expansion of
neighbouring China.
 Gajendra Haldea, a Planning Commission adviser, told
Reuters the government was on track to meet its target to spend
$500 billion on infrastructure between 2007 and 2012, with more
than a third funded by private investors.
 But progress across sectors has been uneven.
 Investment in the telecoms sector is set to jump 34 percent
on the back of a $22 billion splurge on a recent 3G radio
spectrum auction, he said. But the roads sector is likely to
miss its target by 11 percent, railways by 23 percent and ports
by 53 percent.
 ""The 500 billion story is very much intact in terms of
total numbers,"" Haldea said in an interview. ""There have been
high achievements in some cases and shortfalls in others.""
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government expects the
Indian economy to grow by around 8.5 percent this fiscal year
as, like China, it shakes off the effects of the global
financial crisis.
 But experts say poor infrastructure shaves off up to 2
percentage points from India's annual growth.
 A high profile test case will be October's Commonwealth
Games in New Delhi -- intended to showcase India's economic
clout -- but which has been blighted by construction delays in
its venues.
 It may also take more than two years for the government to
meet its 20 kilometres per day road construction target, Haldea
said. The government needed to reform the state-run highway
authority, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), to
speed up progress, he added.
 ""Much depends on how the entire sector especially the NHAI
is run,"" he said. ""It needs some restructuring. It needs clear,
strong leadership, needs efficient and competent processes.""
 The authority had not awarded enough road contracts in the
past three years, Haldea said.
 The government announced a series of measures to boost
funding for India's infrastructure, including a $11 billion
debt fund, in line with its target to double investment to $1
trillion between 2012 and 2017, roughly the size of its current
GDP.
 It will also issue tax-free infrastructure bonds with a
minimum tenure of 10 years to make investment more attractive
to banks that have so far struggled to finance long-term
projects with short-term funds.
 Haldea said such bonds could be issued to AAA-rated private
firms in the future.
 But sectors such as railways and ports need to modernise
fast to attract private investment, he added.
 ""The truth of the matter is that the railways continue to
run as an institution in a manner that is truly outdated. It is
very, very old structure,"" he said.
 ""The railways have not restructured themselves. That is one
of the biggest impediments in change, and in accelerating their
projects. Also because they are a monopoly, the government
monopoly, you know it has been difficult for them to attract
private investment.""
 While the construction opportunities in India are huge and
capital is plentiful, analysts rue there aren't enough
large-scale, quality projects worth financing.
 ""As long as infrastructure bottlenecks are there, it will
erode our competitiveness and make it difficult to achieve
double-digit growth. Sustaining high growth with lower
inflation rate of 5-6 percent will remain a dream,"" said Rupa
Rege Nitsure, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda.
 ""Manufacturing sector is already suffering capacity
constraints due to shortages in power and transport sectors.""

19,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2010 09:24AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-S.Africa faces hard choices to solve jobs crisis," * Chronic long-term unemployment hampers S.African growth
 * More exports to emerging markets seen as key
 * Labour reform likely to meet union opposition
 
 By Ed Cropley, African Investment Correspondent
 JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Reuters) - South Africa is taking an
urgent look at its economy as it battles chronic joblessness and
mediocre growth, focusing on new markets and productivity in its
quest to raise living standards.
 But reforming labour markets, one obvious way to help narrow
the gap with other emerging economies, will not be easy given
the political clout of a union movement that was instrumental in
bringing an end to white-minority rule in the 1990s.
 ""You need a much more flexible labour force but the unions
are still very powerful,"" Mthuli Ncube, chief economist at the
African Development Bank, said.
 ""How do you tell the unions, 'Don't ask for more wages,
don't unionise?' They're such a big political and social force.
I don't know how you deal with that.""
 Similarly, boosting the export sector by weakening the rand,
a proposal endorsed this week by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), risks stoking inflation and
scaring off the foreign capital needed to pay for much-needed
infrastructure.
 It is a hard choice, but there is a growing realisation in
the upper echelons of the African National Congress (ANC) that
something has to be done.
 Since a spike in employment in the six years that followed
the end of apartheid in 1994, the number of jobs in Africa's
biggest economy has plateaued, despite annual growth of around 5
percent from 2002-2007.
 Now, after the first recession in 17 years, the official and
narrowly defined rate of unemployment stands at 25 percent, a
source of much newspaper comment and ANC hand-wringing.
 It is, however, the least worrying set of jobs data.
 As a simple percentage of its 17 million-strong workforce,
South Africa's unemployment is actually around 45 percent, and
has never been below 40 percent since 2000.
 Such stagnation points to its workforce being one of the
world's least productive, and a principle reason the economy
struggles to grow faster than 4-5 percent a year -- speedy when
compared to Europe but anaemic alongside Asia or more dynamic
African 'frontier' markets such as Nigeria, Ghana or Uganda.
 Of rich and emerging economies in 2008, only Turkey fared
worse in terms of labour usage, with one in two of its
workforce idle, according to the OECD.
 Brazil and Russia, two 'BRIC' economies that South Africa
likes to regard as its emerging market peers, have broad
unemployment of only 25 percent, the Paris think-tank says.
 
 MORE EXPORTS
 So what can be done to drag the millions of jobless South
Africans, most of them young, poorly educated and black, into
work and, ultimately, tackle crime and yawning inequality?
 The ANC is already pumping a whopping 20 percent of its
budget into education, and large amounts into job training, to
address a shortage of skills, but it also knows the economy must
provide jobs for people once they do leave school.
 One solution is to refocus the economy on exports,
especially in labour intensive sectors like clothes and
electronics, rather than the coal and gold shipments that have
been South Africa's staples for decades.
 The ANC has also seen the sense of selling to the faster
growing economies of Asia, South America and Africa, rather than
the traditional markets of Europe and the United States that
will see only weak growth in the next few years.
 ""South Africa needs to look for alternative export markets,
such as Africa, and other fast-growing emerging economies, where
our comparative advantage is good,"" Finance Minister Pravin
Gordhan said in email answers to a Reuters request for details
on plans to overhaul the economy.
 To this end, Gordhan wrote of the need to reform ""network
industries"", basically the underinvested and overstaffed state
firms running South Africa's ports and railways.
 But more trade with the likes of, say, China and India, the
other two members of the BRIC quartet, means more competition,
and in terms of labour costs South Africa fares poorly.
 The average monthly salary, including overtime and benefits,
is 6,400 rand ($830), according to Statistics SA.
 By contrast, this year the official average monthly wage for
a city worker in China has been 1,783 yuan ($263) and a menial
entry-level factory worker could be on a third of that, albeit
with food and dormitory accommodation thrown in.
 
 WEAKER RAND OR LOWER WAGES?
 Such comparisons throw the spotlight on arguments from South
Africa's unions to boost exports by weakening the rand ,
whose value has been underpinned in the last year by foreigners
buying up local stocks and bonds.
 COSATU, the union federation that forms part of an official
ANC-led government alliance, wants an end to the rand's free
float in favour of a fixed rate of 10 to the dollar, compared to
its current 7.6.
 Yet even at this level the improvement in raw labour costs
against China would be marginal, and the central bank is wary of
the inflation that would inevitably result.
 All of which points to the labour market as one of the few
avenues left open to reform, essentially by making it easier for
employers to hire and fire workers.
 Yet it is a brave president who takes on unions who still
wield huge social and political clout due to their prominence in
the struggle against apartheid, and during his first year in
office Jacob Zuma has tended to favour consensus over conflict.
Gordhan's answers to Reuters avoided the issue of labour
reform, but in a major report this week the OECD made clear its
belief that the ANC and unions' perfectly laudable desire for
""decent work"" was at the expense of wider job creation.
 Such comments, alongside an avalanche of research on South
Africa during and after its successful hosting of the World Cup,
may yet provide the impetus for long-term and radical change.
 The alternative is a South Africa stuck on a ""spluttering
trajectory"" well below emerging market rivals, political analyst
Alec Russell wrote in the Financial Times last week.
 ""South Africa's economy has been utterly outstripped by the
'southern' giants of China, India and Brazil,"" he said.

 * Ukraine to reduce wheat, barley exports, boost maize
 
 (Adds comments, details)
 By Pavel Polityuk
 KIEV, July 21 (Reuters) - An expected fall in Ukraine's
grain harvest in 2010 will not lead to export restrictions, the
government said, but analysts forecast a sharp decrease in
shipments of two leading Ukrainian cereals - wheat and barley.
 Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said on Wednesday
any limits would damage Ukraine's image as the world's leading
grain exporter and that the government would try to fill demand
in the domestic market by making large state purchases.
 ""We will not impose export restrictions,"" Prysyazhnyuk told
reporters. ""Taking into account that local prices are rising, we
will propose to increase our purchase prices.""
 Severe winter frosts followed by record high summer heat
have destroyed crops on some 700,000 hectares sown with barley
and wheat, and analysts say it could reduce barley yields to
2.28 tonnes per hectare from 2.35 tonnes in 2009.
 They said wheat yields were likely to fall to 2.89 tonnes
per hectare in 2010 from 3.15 tonnes in 2009.
 UkrAgroConsult, an agriculture consultancy, has said the
wheat crop could fall to 18.65 million tonnes from 19.13 million
in 2009 and that poor weather cut the share of milling wheat to
25-30 percent this year from about 40-45 percent in 2009.
 According to the consultancy's calculations, the milling
wheat harvest could total about 6 million tonnes in 2010, which
is just about as much as Ukraine consumes domestically.
The absence of a milling wheat surplus this year has
triggered market speculation the government could impose export
restrictions this season.
 Ukraine restricted grain exports in the 2007/08 season when
its wheat output dropped to 13.7 million tonnes after ice killed
crops on more than a million hectares. The government said at
the time the limits would ensure the population had enough
bread.
 This time, Prysyazhnyuk said, the government planned to buy
up to 5 million tonnes of grain in stocks to prevent any food
shortage in 2010/11. Ukraine had in stocks 4.9 million tonnes of
grain, including 2.5 million of wheat, as of July 1.

 LOWER WHEAT, BARLEY EXPORTS
 Ukraine consumes about 26 million tonnes of grain per
season, and official grain balances would allow the country to
export 16 million tonnes of grain this season.
 Analysts see exports at about 18 million tonnes but say
maize will dominate that volume.
 Volodymyr Lapa, an analyst for the Ukrainian Agribusiness
Club, said maize exports could rise to 6.8 million tonnes in
2010/11 from 5.3 million in 2009/10, while wheat sales could
fall to 6.7 million tonnes from 9.2 million.
 Ukraine is also likely to cut barley exports to 4.8 million
tonnes from 6.2 million in 2009/10.
 ""There are no grounds to impose export limits,"" Lapa said.
 Mykola Vernitsky from ProAgro consultancy said Ukraine would
be able to export up to 18 million tonnes of grain, including
about 7 million of wheat. But he said the share of milling wheat
in exports could fall.
 ""We can forecast the export of a maximum of 3 million tonnes
of milling wheat this season,"" Vernitsky said, adding that a
fall in Russian wheat harvest and exports due to drought would
increase demands for Ukrainian wheat.
 He said a recent rise in local grain prices was caused by a
panic after reports of a drought in Russia and rains in Europe,
which could cut harvests.
 ""Grain prices will fall in August after harvesting as there
is no real base for such a sharp rise"", Vernitsky said.

 * Indian rupee to firm against dollar over 12 months
 * Russian rouble to strengthen versus dollar, euro
 
 By Samantha Pearson and Anurag Joshi
 SAO PAULO/MUMBAI, July 21 (Reuters) - A slowdown in Brazil's
booming economy and jitters over the country's presidential
election will cause the real to trail behind other BRIC nations'
currencies over the next year, a Reuters poll showed on
Wednesday.
 While the currencies of India, China and Russia should
appreciate modestly over the next 12 months, the Brazilian real
is expected to weaken to 1.82 per dollar by the end of June
2011, according to the median prediction from 47 analysts.
 Forecasters downgraded their outlook for the Russian rouble
versus the dollar compared with the previous Reuters poll in
March and they remained cautious about Brazil's currency.
 The so-called BRIC nations have assumed ever-greater
importance in the world, as those economies have begun to
outgrow their more developed counterparts. Analysts credit
expanding BRIC economies with boosting the global recovery.
 But previous currency gains in Brazil mean the real could
struggle to hold on to its current level.
 ""Brazil is still overvalued,"" said Flavia Cattan-Naslausky
of RBS Securities. ""So overall, that's actually a pretty decent
performance for the currency.""
 Foreign investors trade Brazil's real through
non-deliverable forwards, or NDFs -- used when a currency
cannot be used for settlement outside its country of origin.
NDFs are settled in cash and in dollars.
 Brazil's economy bounced back from the global financial
crisis last year due to strong demand from the country's growing
middle class and government tax breaks.
 And as investors worldwide flocked to the country's
high-yielding assets, the real surged 34 percent last year.
 But recent data, including inflation and industrial
production, have suggested Latin America's biggest economy is
slowing as the effects of government stimulus measures wear off.
 Worries that a European debt crisis and sluggish U.S. growth
could reduce demand for Brazil's commodity exports have also
helped weaken the real about 2 percent so far this year.
 A presidential election in October, and its continuing
effects, could add to the pressure -- albeit perhaps only
temporarily.
 ""The elections could bring some volatility, which should
dissipate once the market sees there are no big (policy)
ruptures,"" said Andre Sacconato, an economist at Tendencias
consultancy in Sao Paulo.
 
 INDIAN RUPEE TO RECOVER
 The partially convertible Indian rupee ranked once again as
forecasters' top bet for appreciation among the BRIC currencies.
 The rupee, which has lost nearly 7 percent from its 2010
peak of 44.18 per dollar hit in April, is expected to recover
some lost ground, as the growing economy draws foreign
investors.
 The rupee has been convertible on current account since
1994, meaning it can be changed freely into foreign currency for
purposes like trade-related expenses. But it cannot be converted
freely for activities like acquiring overseas assets.
 The rupee should appreciate around 6 percent to 44.6 by the
end of June next year, according to the median poll forecast.
 ""One of the critical value drivers for the rupee are the
growth prospects, and returns India offers will be higher. In
the usual scenario, we should see more capital inflows,"" said
Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist with rating agency CRISIL.
 Russia's rouble was seen strengthening a bit to 29.6 per
dollar in 12 months from around 30.45 on Wednesday, and to 36.75
per euro from 39.03 currently.
 The 12-month forecast spread for the rouble against the euro
was the narrowest since this poll was launched in October last
year, suggesting a greater sense of confidence. But analysts
nonetheless saw reason for caution.
 ""It would be naive to think that all is rosy in Russia. By
no measures is domestic demand back to pre-crisis levels, and it
will take time for households to regain their wealth,"" said
Guillaume Tresca of Credit Agricole CIB.
 ""In this regard, the political authorities have failed to
put in place the structural reforms that would allow the Russian
economy to be less dependent on external growth.""
 Russia has pledged to move towards a free float and has
lifted most capital controls, but the central bank still
intervenes regularly to smooth exchange rate fluctuations and
has said repeatedly said that it is not considering completely
abandoning interventions in the future.
 Meanwhile, China will be true to its word and prevent a
sharp rise in the newly unshackled yuan over the next year,
according to a Reuters poll conducted on June 21.
 The yuan will end 2010 at 6.67 per dollar, according to the
median forecast of 33 economists.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Wednesday after weak demand at an auction of
Portuguese debt highlighted the fragility of the euro zone
banking sector ahead of European bank stress test results later
in the week.
 The euro extended losses after the auction, dipping just
below $1.28 following earlier reports of quasi-official selling
around the $1.29 level, as investors awaited testimony from
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
 Portugal sold 1.25 billion euros in 12-month Treasury bills,
but the average yield more than doubled from the previous sale,
while the bid-to-cover ratio was much lower.
 ""The euro is correcting lower as a result of the Portuguese
auction,"" said Michael Hewson, currency strategist at CMC
Markets.
 ""It doesn't take much to sow seeds of doubt in the euro.""
 But analysts said Bernanke's testimony, which begins at 1800
GMT, is likely to set the tone in terms of euro/dollar
sentiment, with investors looking for any remark that could
boost speculation of more U.S. monetary easing. 
 ""The European stress test results will be seen in light of
the market sentiment at the time, which will be set by
Bernanke,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at nabCapital
in London.
 By 1139 GMT, the euro was down 0.5 percent on the day at
$1.2817, having hit a session low of $1.2791, stopping just
short of its 200 hour moving average around $1.2787.
 The 50 percent retracement of the euro's peak-to-trough move
in April-June lies at $1.2783, according to Reuters data, while
trendline support drawn from lows hit so far this month came in
at $1.2757 on Wednesday.
 The euro fell broadly, losing more than 1.0 percent against
the yen, 0.5 percent versus sterling and around 0.75 percent
against the Swiss franc.
 But its downside was limited as a 1.6 percent rise in
European shares suggested some demand for riskier assets.
 YEN GAINS
 The dollar slipped 0.6 percent to 86.95 yen on selling by
Japanese exporters. It hovered near a seven-month trough of
86.27 yen on EBS late last week.
 The dollar is struggling as expectations of a Fed rate rise
in 2011 fade, while speculation about more easing has grown
after weak U.S data.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield hit a record low of
0.57 percent on Tuesday, about 20 basis points less than the
yield on two-year German bonds. Until less than a month ago,
U.S. notes yielded more than German debt.
 Analysts said euro movements may be limited before the
results of bank stress tests as they may show how European banks
would cope with weakness in the region's economy. However, some
analysts said investors may not be convinced by the results if
the test criteria are considered to be too lax.
""The credibility of the stress test will crucially depend on
applied sovereign hair cut ratios and too much of a fudge
on this side will not bode well for the euro,"" analysts at BNP
Paribas said in a note.
 Sterling was down 0.1 percent at $1.5256, recouping losses
after falling sharply due to an erroneous trade.

 LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Wednesday after a weak auction of Portuguese debt
highlighted the fragility of the euro zone banking sector ahead
of European bank stress test results later in the week.
 Portugal sold 1.25 billion euros in 12-month Treasury bills,
but the average yield more than doubled from the previous sale,
while the bid-to-cover ratio was much lower.
 The euro hit the day's low after the auction, as traders
booked profits on the single currency's rally to a 10-week high,
while investors awaited testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke.
 ""The euro is correcting lower as a result of the Portuguese
auction,"" said Michael Hewson, currency strategist at CMC
Markets.
 ""It doesn't take much to sow seeds of doubt in the euro.""
 Still, he added that euro losses were limited as traders
awaited Bernanke's semi-annual testimony on the economy and
monetary policy at 1800 GMT.
 After a run of weak U.S. data, investors waited to see if
his remarks would boost speculation the Fed may offer more
monetary accommodation.
 By 1014 GMT, the euro was down more than 0.4 percent on the
day at a session low of $1.2818. It fell some 1.0 percent
against the yen and 0.5 percent versus sterling.
 But its downside was limited as a 1.6 percent rise in
European shares suggested some demand for riskier assets, while
support was seen in the $1.2755/1.2785 region.
 The 50 percent retracement of the euro's peak-to-trough move
in April-June lies at $1.2783, according to Reuters data, while
trendline support drawn from lows hit so far this month came in
at $1.2757 on Wednesday.
 Some analysts said market participants were looking for
fresh factors to extend the single currency's corrective rally,
and it may be confined to narrow ranges before results of
European bank stress test are announced on Friday.

 YEN GAINS
 The dollar slipped 0.5 percent to 87.04 yen on selling by
Japanese exporters. It hovered near a seven-month trough of
86.27 yen on EBS late last week.
 Sterling was little changed at $1.5280, recouping losses
after falling sharply due to an erroneous trade.
 The dollar is struggling as expectations of a Fed rate rise
in 2011 fade, while speculation about more easing has grown
after weak U.S data. Figures on Tuesday showed housing starts
fell more than expected in June.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield hit a record low of
0.57 percent on Tuesday, about 20 basis points less than the
yield on two-year German bonds. Until less than a month ago,
U.S. notes yielded more than German debt. Some analysts say the
reversal has spurred buying in the euro.
 With interest rate differentials playing a key role in
currency markets, Bernanke's comments could set the tone of the
markets in coming weeks, traders said.
 Analysts said euro movements may be limited before the
results of bank stress tests as they may show how European banks
would cope with weakness in the region's economy.
 Still, some analysts said investors may not be convinced by
the results if the test criteria are considered to be too lax.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2010 06:16AM ET</span>","Sarkozy urges Franco-German ""fiscal convergence"""," PARIS, July 21 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy
called on Wednesday for France and Germany to work towards a
convergence of their fiscal systems.
 In a statement issued after German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble attended a French cabinet meeting, Sarkozy proposed a
joint inventory of the two countries' tax and budget systems to
be conducted by the French Court of Auditors and its German
counterpart.
 The aim was that ""our two governments are in a position to
take decisions to move towards a necessary fiscal convergence
both on business taxation and on personal taxation"", he said.
 The statement did not spell out whether the two countries
would harmonise their tax rates, which are widely different.
 France collects less in income tax and far more in indirect
taxation than Germany. It also has a wealth tax, abolished in
Germany after a constitutional court ruling in 1995.
 The overall tax burden in France amounted to 42.8 percent of
gross domestic product in 2008, compared to 39.5 percent in
Germany. However, French public spending is much higher at 55.6
percent of GDP in 2009 compared to 47.6 percent in Germany.
 ""The convergence of our fiscal systems is an essential
element of our economic integration and the deepening of the
European internal market,"" Sarkozy said.
 There was no immediate response from the German side but
Schaeuble was due to hold a joint news conference later with
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.

 * About 60 pct of voters want sales tax debate - media
(Adds comment from senior lawmaker)
 By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Yoko Nishikawa
 TOKYO, July 21 (Reuters) - Japan's ruling Democratic Party
should not shy away from debate on raising sales tax in the
country despite a major setback in this month's upper house
election, a senior party executive said on Wednesday.
 The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and its tiny partner lost
their majority in parliament's upper house after Prime Minister
Naoto Kan floated a possible doubling of the 5 percent sales tax
to curb the country's massive public debt, and failed to persuade
the public that he had a well-crafted plan for curing Japan's
economic woes.
 The Democrats are still in power because they have a majority
in the more powerful lower house, but they need allies to help
pass bills including in the upper chamber and press on with plans
to rein in debt and generate economic growth.
 ""It's not good for Japanese democracy if the ruling party
shuns sales tax debate because that leads to an election defeat,""
Goshi Hosono, the DPJ's deputy secretary-general, said at a media
luncheon on Wednesday.
 ""There may be other things for us to do before starting the
tax debate, such as reducing the number of lawmakers and
reforming the civil servant system,"" he added.
 ""But we should not shun discussion on the sales tax.""
 Japan's public debt is the equivalent of twice the $5
trillion economy -- by far the biggest in the developed world.
 While many voters were put off by the abrupt way Kan broached
the touchy topic, about 60 percent support his proposal to begin
cross-party debate on tax reform, according to a poll by NHK
public TV released on Tuesday.
 Hosono also said the DPJ was willing to work with opposition
parties to avoid policy paralysis. ""Japan faces a lot of pressing
issues in and outside the country. We cannot afford to allow
national politics to come to a standstill,"" he said.
 ""We would like to talk to opposition parties on each bill, so
that we can work together on it, including a possible revision.""
 TIME TO REVISE
 Yoko Komiyama, a senior DPJ lawmaker, told Reuters in an
interview that some of the ruling party's key campaign pledges
such as providing child allowances, abolishing highway tolls and
giving income support to farmers may need to be revised to gain
support from opposition parties.
 ""Those steps have to be tackled individually ... to see
what's needed to get cooperation,"" Komiyama, a member of the
party's executive committee, said.
 She added that the DPJ's policy panel, which was revived
after Kan took office, would play a key role in supporting the
government in crafting policies and coordinating with the
administration on compiling the budget for the year from April 1.
 The policy panel will meet on Thursday to discuss its own
proposals for the next fiscal year's budget, which will likely be
reflected in the government's budget outline due next week.
 Some analysts worry that some of key policy decisions by the
government and ruling party may be delayed until after the
Democrats pick a new leader in a September leadership race.
 Hosono dodged a question about whether party powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa, who many speculate will launch a leadership
challenge to Kan in the September party election, would stage a
comeback, but said cooperation among party members was vital.
 The DPJ sidelined the former secretary general, viewed by
many voters as an old-fashioned wheeler dealer, ahead of the
election, but some political analysts say his politicking talents
may be what the party needs to win new allies.
 ""He is a man who has been playing a very important role in
Japanese politics and personally I learned a lot from him,""
Hosono said. ""What we have to do is to seek ways for all of us to
join up.""

(Adds comments on allocations, background)
 By Chikafumi Hodo
 TOKYO, July 21 (Reuters) - French asset manager Amundi said
on Wednesday it is aiming for a 40 percent increase in its Japan
assets to $50 billion within three years and will focus on wooing
cash-rich retail investors.
 Amundi, the French asset management venture of Credit
Agricole and Societe Generale, plans to offer several investment
trust funds to Japanese retail investors soon, executives told a
news conference on Wednesday.
 Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi Asset
Management, said the company favours corporate credit, equities
from European and emerging economies, while government bonds from
developed countries were less attractive.
 Amundi sees the Japanese retail investment market as more
promising than the institutional one, as assets held by
individuals total some $15 trillion and are still largely in
low-yielding bank deposits.
 Retail investors are seeking higher returns and Amundi is
planning to launch several new publicly placed investment trust
funds in the near term.
 In contrast, institutional investors, such as pension funds,
are more risk adverse as they have to focus on meeting their
payment obligations rather than taking on risk.
 ""We are targeting to reach $50 billion within three years
... and to be number one in retail business (in Japan),"" said
Christian Romeyer, president of Amundi Japan.
 The company was created last year by the merger of the asset
management arms of two French banks, Credit Agricole and Societe
Generale. Credit Agricole owns 75 percent while SocGen holds 25
percent.
 Its assets under management in Japan total about 3 trillion
yen ($34.3 billion).
 Amundi Japan, which has a partnership with Japan's Resona
Bank, is looking to form more tie-ups with distributors which
include regional banks and brokerages, Romeyer said.
 The firm favours corporate credits and high-yielding
corporate bonds due to receding default risk, Amundi's Blanque
said.
 Amundi also likes emerging country debt due to hopes for
higher yields and appreciation in currencies in some of those
states.
 The company has built up positions in European and emerging
market equities over U.S. equities, Blanque said.
 But the firm believes prices of government bonds, especially
in developed countries, are too expensive.
 ""In the core developed government bond markets, yields are
low, (they are) expected to remain low because there is risk
aversion and captive demand,"" Blanque said.
 He added that Japanese government bonds are less attractive
with deflation easing and consumer prices in an upward trend.
 Amundi as a whole holds about 688 billion euros ($886.8
billion) in assets under management.

 * MPC considers ""modest easing"" as well as tightening
 * Growth outlook weakened over past month
 * Sterling falls, gilt futures rally on dovish tone

(Adds detail, reaction)
 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Bank of England rate-setters
discussed easing monetary policy for the first time since
February, minutes of their July 7-8 meeting showed on Wednesday,
reflecting growing concerns about Britain's economic prospects.
 The Monetary Policy Committee's first meeting since
Britain's austere emergency budget last month produced the
expected 7-1 split in favour of keeping rates at a record low
0.5 percent, as lone hawk Andrew Sentance maintained his call
for a 0.25 percentage point rise in rates.
 More of a surprise to economists was the MPC's downbeat tone
on growth, and the fact that arguments for a ""modest easing"" in
monetary policy -- in practice, an increase to the 200 billion
pounds of quantitative easing already pumped into the economy --
were discussed alongside the case for a ""modest tightening"".
 ""Clearly we have Sentance at one end of the spectrum but
there's a broad range of views on the committee. But now they
are clearly concerned about developments in the global economy
and particularly the downside risks,"" said UBS analyst Amit
Kara.
 The MPC faces a dilemma. British inflation is still well
above its 2 percent target after hitting a 17-month high of 3.7
percent in April. But the nascent economic recovery looks
increasingly fragile as fiscal austerity becomes the watchword
across much of Europe.
 Before the minutes were released, most economists had not
expected the BoE to raise rates before early next year, yet
neither did many see a revival in the quantitative easing
programme that was paused in February.
 So sterling  fell and gilt futures  turned
positive on the news, as investors sensed policy tightening
could be even further off than they thought.
 ""The voting arithmetic may indicate that a `hawkish' bias
persists within the MPC but our interpretation of the July
minutes is that there has been a dovish shift in the balance of
opinion,"" said RBS economist Ross Walker.
 ""The `hawkish' contingent will be capped at two members and
the underlying risks will shift in a dovish direction. By
November, a three-way split is more likely than not.""
 
 DOWNBEAT ON GROWTH
 The minutes were noticeably more downbeat on growth, saying
prospects had worsened over the month, possibly into the medium
term.
 Forward-looking business survey indicators in Britain and
overseas had weakened, and pressure in bank funding markets
meant the availability of credit to firms and households was not
improving as much as before, MPC members said.
 Finance minister George Osborne's June 22 budget -- which
pencils in 25 percent cuts to most departmental spending --
would probably slightly reduce growth, but averted the risk that
a sharp spike in gilt yields could derail the recovery.
 However, near-term inflation prospects had also worsened and
consumer price inflation was likely to be higher in the rest of
2010 than envisaged in the May inflation report.
 ""In the light of the news over the month, it seemed likely
that growth would be weaker than previously expected but, at
least for a while, inflation was likely to be higher,"" the
minutes said.
 MPC member Adam Posen said in a Dow Jones interview
published late on Tuesday that monetary policy could move either
way, and the June budget would not make a significant difference
to updated BoE forecasts due next month [ID:nLDE66J20C].
 In the minutes, policymakers acknowledged the risk that
persistently above-target prices rises could raise households'
inflation expectations, but said there was little evidence of
this happening so far, with wage growth remaining subdued.
 Most members were happy on balance to leave the stance
unchanged, confident that spare capacity in the economy would
bring inflation back to target in the medium term once the
effect of temporary factors had worn off.
 Sentance said that a return to growth and a rebound in
inflation meant the time for a rate rise was now.

 By Saranya Suksomkij
 BANGKOK, July 21 (Reuters) - Leading Thai conglomerate
Berli Jucker said it was keen to bid for the Southeast Asian
operations that French retailer Carrefour has put up for sale
at a potential price of $1 billion.
 Carrefour's business would help Berli expand into new
businesses and strengthen its consumer product segment for
long-term growth, Managing Director Asavin Techacharoenvikun
told reporters on Wednesday.
 ""We are ready to bid for Carrefour's businesses in several
ways. We are considering several options and waiting for
bidding details from Carrefour,"" he said, adding Berli had been
approached by the seller's financial adviser about a deal.
 Carrefour wants to sell its units in Malaysia, Singapore
and Thailand to help it focus on core markets where it holds
leading positions.
 Carrefour declined to comment on the deal.
 Over recent years, the French retailer has withdrawn from
other Asian markets, including Japan and South Korea, to focus
on growing markets such as China and India.
 The first round of bids for the Carrefour assets is due in
early September, sources with knowledge of the deal told
Reuters, and bankers expect at least four or five bids. Private
equity firms are interested, but a strategic buyer may have an
advantage.
 ""(Carrefour's assets) natural home is a strategic buyer. It
is quite a difficult business to manage,"" an executive at a
private equity firm told Reuters.
 Singapore-listed Dairy Farm, which owns Cold Storage and
Giant superstores in Singapore and Malaysia, and Britain's
Tesco could also be bidders, sources familiar with the deal
said.
 Tesco and Dairy Farm declined to comment.
 EXPANSION
 Berli, looking to expand and tap growing demand for
consumer products, is also eyeing assets in Vietnam, Asavin
said.
 Majority owned by TCC Holding of liquor tycoon Charoen
Sirivadhanabhadi, Berli is valued at $875 million on the Thai
bourse, making it the country's largest consumer products group
ahead of Saha Pathana Inter Holding.
 It produces a wide range of consumer and pharmaceutical
products and runs a glass packaging business. This week a
subsidiary completed a $222 million acquisition of Malaya Glass
Products from Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd.
 In 2009, Asia accounted for 7.9 pct of Carrefour's sales of
85.9 billion euros ($111 billion), while Thailand contributed
9.1 percent of Asian sales, based on the company's latest
accounts, giving Thai sales of about $800 million.
 Thai broker Phillip Securities has put a sale price of
16-19 billion baht ($496-$590 million) on the Thai operations.
 Carrefour has 626 stores in Asia, with 424 in China alone.
Of the rest, Indonesia has 76, Taiwan 65, Malaysia 19,
Singapore two and Thailand 40, including 39 hypermarkets.
 In Thailand, Carrefour has a market share of around 2
percent behind CP All, Tesco and Big C Supercenter, part-owned
by France's Casino, which are the top three retailers,
according to RBS.
 Big C is widely expected to bid for the Carrefour stores.
The company declined to comment.
 Woolworths Ltd, Australia's largest supermarket chain, is
also expected to have a look, but its management is not very
enthusiastic, one source familiar with the process told
Reuters. Woolworths declined to comment.
 Goldman Sachs and UBS are working with Carrefour on the
sale.
 Berli shares gained 1.1 percent on Wednesday, and have more
than trebled since mid-May.

 * Iran OPEC governor sees room for higher prices
 * BP spill will raise costs
 
 (Updates throughout)
 By Barbara Lewis
 DUBAI, July 21 (Reuters) - International sanctions against
Iran are not new and it will adapt to the latest round of more
severe U.S. and European measures that specifically target the
oil and gas industry, Iran's OPEC governor told Reuters.
 He also said Iran was willing to be flexible about which
currencies it used for oil trade following statements it was
contemplating the United Arab Emirates' currency for its
European transactions.
 ""The point is the sanctions are not new. The shape is
different. We can carry on,"" Iran's OPEC governor Mohammad Ali
Khatibi said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
 The U.S., which suspects Iran of trying to build a nuclear
bomb -- something it has denied -- has signed into law new
sanctions that U.S. President Obama said are the toughest yet.
 The European Union is also expected to adopt new sanctions
on Monday.
 Analysts have said the tougher measures would make it even
more difficult for Iran to develop its dilapidated oil industry
and to import refined products to make up for the country's lack
of refining capacity.
 Khatibi said Iran could cope.
 ""Still we are developing projects and we can expand our gas
industry, refining, petrochemicals industry,"" he said.
 ""We can change our industry to produce more gasoline. We are
constructing some refineries.""
 Iran is also planning to reduce government fuel subsidies,
which will drive up the cost and reduce domestic demand.
 ""We are going to adjust our local prices, not only for
gasoline but for other fuels,"" said Khatibi.
 ""I am sure when the price is adjusted from very low levels
to international levels consumption will reduce significantly.""
 The subsidy reduction would be implemented gradually, but is
a risk for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as it could
stoke inflation and social unrest.
 Khatibi said Iranians would understand and the reduction of
subsidies, in line with fuel-conserving initiatives across the
world, was positive.
 ""People understand this limitation is because we are
engaging with something like war. There are some difficulties I
know, but everybody understands that there is some difficulty,""
he said.
 ""We have planned to change and we are using this as an
opportunity.""
 
 FLEXIBLE TRADE PARTNER
 Iran's adaption to successive waves of sanctions has
included a shift to euros, rather than dollars for some of its
oil trade.
 Now the new European measures raise the possibility banks
could block euro transactions with Iran, an Iranian official
said on Sunday Iran could seek payment in UAE dirhams instead
for European customers.
 Khatibi said it was up to the Iranian central bank to
comment, but what he could say was that Iran was flexible.
 ""I can say that we are flexible if we feel that the euro is
good, also the dollar, also the dirham, the yuan, the yen. We're
flexible,"" he said.
 An official from the central bank told Reuters, the change
of currency was not an issue for it either.
 ""This is an issue between the Iranian exporters and
importers,"" he said.
 ""Right now we have no problems accepting euros but in the
future this might change because there might be some transaction
blocks due to the sanctions and this is an issue that everyone
is looking into right now but no decision has been made on what
to do.""
 Of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, Iran is among those considered to have the
highest oil price needs to help it meet its escalating costs and
the social needs of a large population.
 Khatibi did not directly say whether he was comfortable with
a U.S. futures price of nearly $78 a barrel on Wednesday, but he
saw room for it to rise.
 ""It depends on the cost of other commodities because, as you
know, in the oil industry we have to use some other commodities
for equipment. It's a dynamic issue,"" he said.
 ""From a producer point of view, in some areas production
costs are very high.""
 He cited the BP deepwater spill in the U.S. Gulf as a driver
of costs, with knock-on effects for the price.
 ""Deepwater might be tougher than before. I think there is
room for some price improvement,"" he said.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2010 04:40AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-EU appeals against ruling in WTO Airbus case," * EU appeal had been widely expected
 * Further delays resolution of Airbus-Boeing disputes
 * Airbus, Boeing vying for U.S. military tanker order
(updates with confirmation of appeal, details, links)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, July 21 (Reuters) - The European Union appealed on
Wednesday against a World Trade Organization ruling condemning
its subsidies for Airbus, prolonging a dispute with the United
States for at least several more months.
 A WTO spokeswoman confirmed Brussels filed the appeal
shortly before a special session of the WTO's dispute settlement
body. 
 The meeting, which had been due to begin at 10 a.m. (0800
GMT) but was cancelled because of the appeal, had been called by
the United States to adopt last month's ruling by a panel of
experts in the six-year-old case. 
 This would have required the EU to end prohibited export
subsidies by Britain, Germany and Spain for Airbus's A380
airliner within 90 days, and withdraw other subsidies found
illegal by the WTO or reverse their adverse effects.
 ""This dispute is too important to allow the legal
misinterpretations of the panel to go unchallenged,"" Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht said in a statement.
 The EU argues that the aid that the WTO panel found to be
prohibited export subsidies was not dependent on foreign sales,
and that the panel's judgment on other subsidies was faulty.
 The appeal, which had been widely expected, followed a
decision by another WTO panel examining the EU's countersuit
against U.S. aid for Airbus rival Boeing to postpone an initial
confidential ruling until mid-September from July 16.
 Louis Gallois, chief executive of Airbus parent EADS, has
said that the delay, announced as both aerospace companies
battle for a $50 billion contract from the U.S. Pentagon for
tankers, was unfair.
 The Europeans had hoped that likely criticism of the Boeing
subsidies in that case would have undermined the U.S. company's
allegations that the EADS offer, based on the Airbus A330 plane,
was possible only because of the EU subsidies.
 WTO appellate judges must rule within 60 days under an
accelerated timetable for prohibited subsidies, but in a complex
case like this they could well take longer.
 After that, if the United States believes the EU is not
complying with the ruling within a mutually agreed period, it
can launch a further compliance case. Meanwhile, the rulings in
the dispute over Boeing aid will be issued.
 As a result many trade lawyers believe the dispute -- over
dominance in a market that the companies believe will be worth
$3 trillion over 20 years -- will ultimately be settled through
negotiations between the two sides, as Airbus and the EU
Commission have called for.

 * Forint could test 300 per euro - analysts
 * Potential for cbank intervention seen
 * Doubts remain over whether govt will resume IMF talks
 
 By Michael Winfrey
 Economics correspondent, Central Europe and the Balkans
 PRAGUE, July 21 (Reuters) - The breakdown in Hungary's talks
with international lenders may be chiefly a domestic political
ploy but the Fidesz government is likely to end up suffering for
its failure to take more account of its reputation abroad.
 Markets have wasted no time in punishing Budapest for its
refusal to pursue more of the austerity prescribed by the
European Union and International Monetary Fund, the second time
Fidesz had shocked the financial world since coming to power in
May.
 But while ruling Fidesz officials managed some damage
control in the earlier misstep -- backtracking on comparing
Hungary with Greece in June -- analysts said this week's events
had cemented doubts over the government's policy-making ability.
 That opens up risks to Hungary's economy and its various
assets, ranging from higher debt costs to deterioration in the
country's huge, troubled foreign currency loan market and has
raised some fear of contagion in other emerging European states.
 ""Effectively, Hungary is now without any support from
international lenders,"" said Lars Christensen, chief analyst at
Danske Bank. 
 ""We fear that the government's confrontational style could
trigger more volatility in the Hungarian markets going forward.""
 The forint rebounded on Tuesday from an over 3 percent fall
against the euro a day earlier when it traded at its lowest
levels since early May 2009. Bond yields rose slightly after
climbing 25-30 basis points on Monday, and some analysts say
they could still jump half a percentage point higher.

 CONFIDENCE GONE
 Budapest's economy minister has said he expects talks to
resume with the EU and IMF in September and analysts say the
government has likely walked away at this stage simply to avoid
unpopular belt-tightening ahead of an Oct. 3 local election. 
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said he would stick to a
commitment to achieve a fiscal deficit of 3.8 percent of gross
domestic product this year.
 But Orban, a stubborn politician with a strong domestic
focus, is also fighting to differentiate his cabinet from a
Socialist administration that enacted four years of austerity.
He has made clear he does not want advice from lenders on how
the deficit will be reduced.
 The conflicting messages have wounded the government's
credibility with investors, always nervous about policymaking
given Hungary's history of fiscal blowouts. The European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development has also warned of the risk
of spillover to other countries in the region.
 ""Hungary's case carries a contagion risk for other east
European countries, but they can protect themselves from this to
the extent that they continue their reforms and restructuring,""
EBRD President Thomas Mirow told Germany's Handelsblatt daily.
 Although Budapest has managed to stabilise its finances over
the past 18 months and is far from the dire situation of euro
zone laggard Greece, the economy is still struggling to grow and
investors have raised the premium it costs it to borrow.
 The Finance Ministry cut a 3-month Treasury bill offer by 10
billion forints ($44.49 million) on Tuesday as yields rose 19
basis points from a week earlier.
 Barclay's strategist Koon Chow said the forint could also
fall to 300 per euro -- 12 percent down from March when markets
had cheered an imminent Fidesz election victory -- where the
central bank could intervene to prevent even deeper weakness.
 ""We'll get a lot swings on the forint in between 280-300 per
euro,"" he said. ""We'll get weaker, they'll intervene, then we'll
get stronger, then down again.""

 NO TOLERANCE
 Austerity-minded Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas, whose
country has fought off contagion from Hungary's economic woes
since the start of the global crisis, called for prudence.
 ""The fiscal stabilisation of budgets is crucially important
and I am glad to know that we are all aware of this
responsibility,"" he said at a news conference in Budapest.
 But Fidesz argues that more austerity will only extend a
period of low growth and weak budget revenues, which will not
help the country resolve its budget deficit and reduce a debt
pile that amounts to 80 percent of gross domestic product.
 The experience of other states that have pursued such a path
shows they may be right. Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating on
Monday, saying two-years of belt tightening would hit growth.
 ""At best, Hungarian financial markets look set for an
extremely bumpy ride over the coming weeks and months,"" wrote
David Oxley, an economist at London-based Capital Economics. ""At
worst, Hungary could be muddling into a future fiscal crisis.""
 Market watchers said a number of factors should force Fidesz
to eventually agree with the IMF on austerity measures. 
 A weaker forint currency will directly hit Hungarians who
hold mortgages in Swiss francs -- almost half of all household
debt -- and could hurt Fidesz in the October vote.
 And although the government had not planned to tap the aid
funds, its rising debt costs could, as in Greece and other
countries, eventually force them to embrace austerity. 
 ""It may take until after the local elections for the
necessarydecisions to be taken, and it may require more market
pressures to convince the government to take them,"" analysts
Barclay's said in a note.

 * Euro supported by higher shares on buoyant U.S. earnings
 * Investors await Bernanke for monetary policy view
 
 (Releads, updates throughout; previous TOKYO)
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a 10-week
high against the dollar on Wednesday, supported by strong U.S.
corporate earnings that also boosted global shares.
 The dollar was on the back foot, slipping against a currency
basket and coming under selling pressure versus the yen as
Japanese exporters sold the U.S. currency.
 The euro moved in narrow ranges as investors awaited
testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later in
the day and looked for fresh factors to extend the single
currency's corrective rally.
 ""People are less worried about the euro than they were a
month or two months ago,"" said Johan Javeus, head of global
strategy at SEB in Stockholm.
 He said signs of weakness in the U.S. economy and receding
worries about euro zone public finances helped to support the
euro in holiday-thinned trade.
 ""But the market doesn't know which foot to stand on. It's
not extreme risk aversion or risk demand,"" he added.
 Bernanke gives his semi-annual testimony on the economy and
monetary policy at 1800 GMT. After a run of weak U.S. data,
investors waited to see if his statement would boost speculation
the Fed may offer more monetary accommodation.
 By 0747 GMT, the euro was 0.1 percent higher on the day at
$1.2895, having pulled back from $1.3029 hit on Tuesday, its
strongest since May 10.
 Traders said the euro may struggle to make gains in the near
term as investors take profits on a rally which has taken it up
more than 8 percent since hitting a 4-year low of $1.1876 in
early June.
 But there was also talk of bids in the euro at $1.2860/65
and then at $1.2820, with a mixture of stop-loss sell orders and
bids then expected around $1.2780/2800.
 Analysts said euro movements may be limited before the
results of bank stress test are announced on Friday. Some said
the results may soothe concerns about how European banks would
cope with a deterioration in the region's economy.
 
 YEN GAINS
 The euro was also supported by a 1.4 percent rise in
European shares, after strong results from Apple raised optimism
that the second half of the U.S. second-quarter earnings season
would be better than expected.
 This helped prod the dollar 0.2 percent lower against a
currency basket to 82.575.
 The dollar slipped 0.4 percent to 87.14 yen, as Japanese
exporters lowered their offers after the currency hit a
seven-month trough of 86.27 yen on EBS late last week.
 The dollar is struggling as expectations for a Fed rate rise
in 2011 fade, while speculation of more easing has risen after
weak U.S data. Figures on Tuesday showed a bigger-than-expected
fall in June U.S. housing starts.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield hit a record low of
0.57 percent on Tuesday, about 20 basis points less than the
yield on two-year German bonds.
 Until less than a month ago, U.S. notes yielded more than
German debt. Some analysts say the reversal has spurred buying
in the euro.
 With interest rate differentials playing a key role in
currency markets, Bernanke's comments could set the tone of the
markets in coming weeks, traders said.
 ""Bernanke could hint at further monetary policy easing,
although the possibility of actually relaxing the Fed's policy
is nearly zero,"" said Hideki Hayashi, global economist at Mizuho
Securities in Tokyo.
 He added that such an indication may warm risk appetite and
boost share prices, while adding it was difficult to predict
whether this would add to dollar weakness.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2010 03:44AM ET</span>",Japan DPJ exec: No turning back from tax debate," TOKYO, July 21 (Reuters) - Japan's ruling Democratic Party
should not shy away from debate on raising sales tax in the
country despite a major setback in this month's upper house
election, a senior party executive said on Wednesday.
 The DPJ and its tiny partner lost their majority in
parliament's upper house after Prime Minister Naoto Kan floated a
possible doubling of the 5 percent sales tax to curb the
country's massive public debt, and failed to persuade the public
that he had a well-crafted plan for curing Japan's economic woes.
 The Democrats are still in power because they have a majority
in the more powerful lower house, but they need allies to help
pass bills in the upper chamber and press on with plans to rein
in debt and generate economic growth.
 ""It's not good for Japanese democracy if the ruling party
shuns sales tax debate because that leads to an election defeat,""
Goshi Hosono, the DPJ's deputy secretary-general, said at a media
luncheon on Wednesday.
 ""There may be other things for us to do before starting the
tax debate, such as reducing the number of lawmakers and
reforming the civil servant system,"" he added.
 ""But we should not shun discussion on the sales tax.""
 Japan's overall public debt is the equivalent of twice the $5
trillion economy -- by far the biggest in the developed world.
 While many voters were put off by the abrupt way Kan broached
the touchy topic, about 60 percent support his proposal to begin
cross-party debate on tax reform, according to a poll by NHK
public TV released on Tuesday.
 Hosono also said the DPJ was willing to work with opposition
parties to avoid policy paralysis. ""Japan faces a lot of pressing
issues in and outside the country. We cannot afford to allow
national politics to come to a standstill,"" he said.
 ""We would like to talk to opposition parties on each bill, so
that we can work together on it, including a possible revision.""
 Hosono dodged a question about whether party powerbroker
Ichiro Ozawa, who many speculate will launch a leadership
challenge to Kan in a September party election, would stage a
comeback, but said cooperation among party members was vital.
 The DPJ sidelined the former secretary general, viewed by
many voters as an old-fashioned wheeler dealer, ahead of the
election, but some political analysts say his politicking talents
may be what the party needs to win new allies.
 ""He is a man who has been playing a very important role in
Japanese politics and personally I learned a lot from him,""
Hosono said. ""What we have to do is to seek ways for all of us to
join up.""

 * Ruling Fidesz wants to win Oct. 3 municipal vote as well
 
 By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, July 21 (Reuters) - Hungary's government will
press ahead with plans to tax banks both this year and next,
defying International Monetary Fund and EU calls for structural
spending cuts, as it woos voters before local elections.
 The government has shown surprisingly little sensitivity to
markets since winning a landslide victory in a parliamentary
vote in April and analysts say it is unlikely to back down on
issues of disagreement with the international lenders to avoid
losing face -- and votes.
 The forint fell sharply after the lenders suspended a review
of a 20 billion euro funding agreement signed in October 2008 to
avert financial meltdown after failing to get sufficient clarity
of the government's future economic policies.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban rebuffed the lenders, saying it
was Hungary's ""exclusive national responsibility"" to decide how
it achieved the 2010 3.8 percent of GDP budget deficit target.
 Fidesz won a more than two-thirds majority in parliament,
giving Orban the power to change any law.
 It has stuck resolutely to its populist election promises of
cutting taxes and creating jobs to spur growth, rather than
imposing the deep cuts demanded by lenders and adopted by the
ousted Socialists who were punished at the ballot box.
 Lajos Kosa, vice chairman of the ruling Fidesz party, fired
another warning shot on Wednesday, saying the IMF should be
realistic when considering a 2011 deficit goal of 2.8 percent.
 ""It is obvious that Hungary's situation is one of the most
difficult of all member states in European Union. In such a
situation, expecting us to run the lowest deficit ... they can
say that, but this will not work,"" he told public m1 television.
 ""The IMF must be mindful to remain grounded in realities.""
 Analysts do not see any government change of heart soon.
 ""Orban sticks to an issue if he believes he can win ... and
I think with the bank tax, he will not back down,"" said Csaba
Toth, political analyst at think tank Republikon.
 Toth also said he believed an agreement with lenders on the
funding deal that expires in October, would eventually be
signed, but only once their patience had been sorely tested.
 ""The fact that the latest IMF review came and went without
agreement is a serious concern. The government has shown little
willingness to bow to pressure, re-affirming that it has no
intention of imposing further austerity on the economy,"" said
Timothy Ash at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 
 MARKETS CALMER
 Fidesz wants to pass the bank tax in parliament on Thursday
to raise 200 billion forints ($900 million) in taxes from the
financial sector both this year and next, even though lenders
said deficit cuts should be based on durable structural
measures, especially in 2011, to make the budget sustainable in
the long run.
 It wants to maximise support for the local election on Oct.
3 and introducing austerity measures of the sort of it
campaigned so vehemently against would risk alienating voters.
 Once that election is over, analysts say Fidesz should have
a freer hand, with the next national vote not due until 2014.
 The government will also go ahead with a plan to cap public
sector salaries and cut central bank Governor Andras Simor's pay
-- another issue the EU warned Hungary about.
 ""There is the bank tax and the comments attacking the
independence of the central bank: Orban does not like Simor so
he confronted him directly. He cannot backtrack on this,"" said
Richard Szentpetery Nagy at think tank Meltanyossag.
 ""Fidesz has a big lead in the campaign (to Oct. 3 election)
and if it can keep power on the local level or win over
Budapest, then there won't be another election for three and a
half years,"" added Zoltan Kiszelly, another analyst.
 Markets calmed down on Tuesday and Wednesday but the halt in
talks will maintain uncertainty in Hungarian markets in the
coming months and analysts said the country was running the risk
of renewed currency weakness until a deal is reached.
 The suspension of talks drove down the forint on Monday to
levels of 292 versus the euro last seen in May 2009 while
government bond yields surged.
 Orban will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel later on
Wednesday, with a press conference due at 1315 GMT.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2010 02:32AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-SNB faces criticism as FX interventions lead to loss," * Sharp Swiss franc rise resulted in 14 bln Sfr FX loss
 * SNB's euro holdings soar to 120.5 bln by end Q2
 * H1 loss will fuel public debate over SNB interventions
 
 (Recasts, adds data from monthly report)
 By Katie Reid and Sven Egenter
 ZURICH, July 21 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank expects
to post a first-half loss of around 4 billion Swiss francs due
to exchange rate losses stemming from massive currency
interventions, the central bank said on Wednesday.
 The announcement is likely to fuel criticism of the SNB's
intervention policy in Switzerland where media and economists
have raised concerns about losses on the large amounts of euros
the SNB has acquired and the effectiveness of intervention.
 The SNB's monthly report for July showed that SNB's euro
holdings more than doubled to 120.5 billion euros in the second
quarter, taking the euro's share in the SNB's currency reserves
to 70.5 percent.
The overall currency reserves have risen more than five-fold
since the SNB launched its policy of fighting a rise in the
franc in March 2009, hitting 226.7 billion francs at the end of
June.
 The SNB decided already in December to increase its
provisions in order to take potential losses into account.
 The SNB was applauded for its swift and drastic measures to
mitigate the financial crisis, helping the Swiss economy to
recover much faster than many other European countries.
 But public criticism rose after it stepped up its
interventions during the euro zone debt crisis before dropping
its intervention pledge in June, saying deflation risks had
largely disappeared.
 
 EX-CENTRAL BANKERS CRITICISE
 Switzerland's major broadsheet newspapers have run stories
highlighting the risks of intervention. Former SNB chief
economist Kurt Schiltknecht told one newspaper interventions had
proven to be pointless in the past.
 ""That was a big mistake from the central bank,""
Schiltknecht, who worked for the SNB until 1984, was quoted as
saying by Swiss financial newspaper Handelszeitung.
 Another former SNB chief economist, Georg Rich, said he had
agreed with the SNB's policy until this spring. ""I started to
feel uneasy in May when the central bank bought such large
amounts of euros,"" Rich, who left the SNB at the end of 2001,
was quoted by Handelszeitung.
 The franc appreciated more than 10 percent against the euro
between early January and the end of June and hit a record high
in early July at around 1.3070 per euro. Since then,
the franc has eased to around 1.36.
 Losses on the currency reserves amounted to over 14 billion
francs in the first half of the year, the SNB said.
""The income from foreign currency and Swiss franc positions
and the steep rise in the price of gold limited the extent of
the SNB's half-yearly loss, which is expected to reach
approximately 4 billion Swiss francs,"" the SNB.
 While the public debate has been on potential losses from
the currency interventions, the central bank must also ensure
that the franc liquidity created by the interventions is drained
quickly enough to avoid a build-up of inflation risks.
 The SNB increased the issuance and the range of maturities
of its own debt -- the so called SNB bills -- and launched
reverse repo operations in order to drain liquidity.
 The SNB monthly report showed that the amount of outstanding
debt certificates had risen to 73.3 billion francs by the end of
June from 55 billion at the end of May.
 The SNB is due to post its first-half results on August 13. 
 The bank said results from the stabilisation fund with toxic
assets the SNB bought from UBS as part of the government bailout
for the bank were not yet included in this first-half figure,
but they were expected to make a significant positive
contribution.

 * Fed Chairman Bernanke's testimony before Congress in focus
 * Euro bids seen at $1.2860/65 and below
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 21 (Reuters) - The euro inched up against the
dollar on Wednesday, after being knocked from a 10-week high
above $1.3000 the previous day due to profit-taking ahead of euro
zone bank stress test results this week.
 Traders were also looking to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's semi-annual testimony before Congress on Wednesday and
Thursday, with investors listening for any comments that could
boost speculation about more monetary accommodation.
 ""A rise in U.S. share prices late on Tuesday appeared to be
driven by speculation of more easing steps from the Fed. Thus,
the lack of a hint on further easing in his testimony could hurt
the dollar,"" said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui
Trust and Banking Corp.
 The euro moved little in Asian trade, changing hands at
$1.2885, up less than 0.1 percent from late U.S. trade.
 It rose as far as $1.3029 on trading platform EBS on Tuesday,
its highest since May 10, but has been unable to hold above
$1.3000 after testing it for three days in a row.
 Traders said players were likely to keep taking profits in
the near term on the euro's sharp rally which has taken it up
more than 8 percent since it hit a 4-year low of $1.1876 in early
June.
 But there was also talk of bids in the euro at $1.2860/65 and
then at $1.2820, with a mixture of stop-loss sell orders and bids
then expected around $1.2780/2800. On the charts, former
resistance at about $1.2770-90 has now turned into support.
 Losses in the euro are expected to be limited before the
stress test announcements due on Friday, with some analysts
saying the results could soothe concerns about how European banks
would cope with a deterioration in the region's economy and
financial markets.
 ""Players want to trim long euro positions as they have kept
buying euros since early June,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager
of the foreign securities department at Okasan Securities.
 ""But many continue to bet the euro will remain on an upward
trend, partly due to the dollar's weakness.""
 Against the Japanese currency, the euro dipped 0.3 percent to
112.25 yen.
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 87.13 yen, as Japanese
exporters lowered their offers after they saw the currency
hitting a new seven-month trough of 86.27 yen on EBS.
 But buying from retail Japanese investors and margin traders
is providing the greenback with some support, traders said.
 A string of weaker-than-expected data in recent weeks has
fanned fears about a slowing U.S. recovery, prompting investors
to cut long positions in the greenback.
 Data showed on Tuesday that U.S. housing starts fell more
than expected in June to their lowest level in eight months,
further evidence that the economy has lost momentum in the second
quarter.
 Traders said the dollar is under pressure partly because
expectations for a U.S. interest hike in 2011 are fading and are
being replaced by speculation about further easing.
 The two-year U.S. Treasury note yield hit a record low, and
it now yields about 20 basis points less than two-year German
bonds.
 Until less than a month ago, U.S. notes yielded more than
German debt. Some analysts said the reversal in the bond yields
spurred buying in the euro.
 With interest rate differentials playing a key role in
currency markets, Bernanke's comments could set the tone of the
markets in coming weeks, traders said.
 ""Bernanke could hint at further monetary policy easing,
although the possibility of actually relaxing the Fed's policy is
nearly zero,"" said Hideki Hayashi, global economist at Mizuho
Securities.
 ""Such a hint is likely to warm up investor appetite, lifting
share prices.""
 But how that could move the dollar's exchange rates is hard
to predict, Hayashi said.
 Last week, the Federal Reserve downgraded its economic
outlook for this year but stuck with its prediction of trend to
above-trend growth in 2011.

 * Govt keeps view unchanged, economy picking up steadily
 * Govt official warns chance Japan economy may enter a lull
 * Govt repeats pledge to work with BOJ to end deflation
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO, July 21 (Reuters) - Japan's government maintained its
view that the economy is picking up steadily but warned on
Wednesday there is a risk it may enter a lull on a possible
slowdown in overseas growth.
 That is a slightly more cautious view than the assessment of
the Bank of Japan, which said last week the economy was showing
increasing signs of a recovery on improvements in overseas
growth.
 In its monthly report for July, the government reiterated
that it will work with the BOJ to overcome deflation, which it
described as a top priority.
 Japan's economy has been steadily recovering with the
groundwork being laid for a self-sustained recovery, the
government said in the report, maintaining the view it held in
June, when it revised up its assessment for the first time in
three months.
 But it cautioned that not much progress is being made on the
path towards a self-sustained recovery.
 ""There is a possibility Japan's economy will enter a lull,""
Keisuke Tsumura, parliamentary secretary at the Cabinet Office,
told reporters.
 ""There are uncertainties, mainly overseas factors. We would
like to assess the state of the real economy closely,"" he said.
 The government is closely watching the risk of a possible
slowdown in overseas economies, especially in the United States
and Europe, and market fluctuations hurting Japan's economy, the
report said.
 It is also monitoring the results of stress tests on European
banks, which are expected to be unveiled this week, Tsumura said.
 Japan pulled out of recession in April-June last year and the
economy expanded an annualised 5.0 percent in the first quarter
of this year on solid exports to Asia and consumption driven by
government stimulus measures.
 But analysts expect growth to slow later this year as the
stimulus effect fades and recent gains in the yen hurt exports.
 Still, the government kept its assessment that exports are
increasing moderately. Tsumura said a slowdown in Japan's exports
to Asia and the United States was noticeable, but not enough to
change the government view.

 SINGAPORE, July 21 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on
Wednesday as investors cheered Apple's strong earnings and on
optimism that China may roll back policy tighening measures
later this year, while the euro firmed ahead of euro zone's
bank stress test results late in the week.
 Markets were cautious ahead of testimony from Federal

 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> inched down 0.2 percent,
weighed down by worries about a stronger yen and doubts over
the U.S. economic recovery.
 CHINA POLICY
 Overall, risk-taking in Asia was buoyed by rising optimism
that the Chinese authorities would roll back policy tightening
later this year to support economic growth.
 China's annual economic growth decelerated to 10.3 percent
in the second quarter from 11.9 percent in the first quarter.
 ""Our base case is for loosening to occur in the three
months starting from August but even sooner is possible,""
analysts at Goldman said in a report issued this week.
 In currency markets, the euro inched up against the dollar,
a day after being knocked from a 10-week high above $1.3000 due
to profit-taking ahead of euro zone bank stress test results
due out on Friday.
 The euro rose slightly to $1.2895 . It hit $1.3029 on

 Investors are likely to keep taking profits in the near
term on the euro's sharp rally which has taken it up more than
8 percent since it hit a 4-year low of $1.1876 in early June,
traders say.
 The results of stress tests on 91 European banks, due for
release on Friday, are expected to show most of them would be
able to survive severe economic shocks.
 But they are unlikely to solve problems for weaker banks
which need new funding capital the most, and could even raise
more questions about how authorities will treat any banks that
fail the test.
 Investors are also concerned over how transparent the test
criteria and the test results will be. European Union finance
ministers were divided last week over how much of the data
should be released to the public.
 A wave of capital raisings by bigger regional banks,
similar to that seen after U.S. stress tests, could also add
pressure on European and global equity markets.
 Elsewhere, spot gold  fell about $2.8 to $1,189.6
per ounce, a day after it hit a 2-month low at $1,175.35 before
rebounding sharply to above $1,190 on chart-based buying.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2010 06:32PM ET</span>",FACTBOX-EU appeal against WTO Airbus subsidy ruling," GENEVA, July 21 (Reuters) - The European Union said on
Wednesday it would appeal against a ruling by a World Trade
Organization panel that it paid illegal subsidies to Airbus.
 The following are the main points challenged by the EU in
its appeal.
 * Export subsidies - The WTO panel found that launch aid
paid by Britain, Germany and Spain for Airbus's A380 superjumbo
was a prohibited export subsidy, because governments anticipated
exports when they granted the support.
 - The EU will argue that launch aid contracts merely require
repayment over a number of sales and are neutral as to whether
those sales are exports or domestic. The interest payments are
the same in both cases. So there is no incentive in launch aid
for Airbus to favour exports.
 * Launch aid - The panel found that 21 instances of launch
aid granted to Airbus were subsidies because interest rates on
the loans were below market rates.
 - The EU argues that in some cases there was no subsidy at
all, and in others the panel exaggerated the amount of subsidy.
 - The EU will also appeal the panel's findings that are
based on interest rates calculated by the United States. This
interest rate comprised the government borrowing rate --
effectively the bond rate varying from member state to member
state, a corporate risk premium and a project-specific risk
premium. The exact figures are confidential for business reasons
but the EU says its estimate of the corporate risk premium for
Airbus was less than half that estimated by the United States.
 * Infrastructure - The panel found that infrastructure
provided at Airbus plants in Hamburg, Toulouse and Bremen was a
subsidy.
 - The EU believes the panel confused the ""creation"" of
infrastructure -- a core government function, with the
""provision"" of infrastructure, which can be a subsidy if
provided below market rates. But it says Airbus paid a market
rent or purchase price and so there was no subsidy.
 * Equity infusions - The panel found that several injections
of capital by the French government and transfer of the French
government's stake in Dassault to Aerospatiale were subsidies.
 - The EU says these transactions reflected the behaviour of
normal market investors based on Airbus's strong prospects and
independent valuations.
 * Research and development support - The panel found that
grants to Airbus under the EU Framework Programme were specific
subsidies, not generally available to other firms, because of
the existence of ring-fenced budgets for aerospace research.
 - The EU argues that separate sectoral budgets in this
programme exist precisely to avoid disproportionate use of the
programme by certain sectors leading to specific subsidies.
 * Adverse effects - The panel found that the subsidies
enabled Airbus to take market share from U.S. rival Boeing on
the EU and some export markets, while Boeing lost sales to
Airbus.
 - In particular the EU objects to the panel's conclusion
that no Airbus plane could have existed without subsidies, so
any adverse effects suffered by Boeing are the result of
subsidies. It believes many Airbus planes, such as the A380
superjumbo, could have been launched without subsidies.
 - The EU will also argue that some of the panel's findings
on market share displacement are based on incorrect evaluation
of data.
 - It will also argue against the panel's finding that there
is a single market for large civil aircraft, rather than several
different markets depending on size and capacity.
 * Other issues
 - The EU will appeal against some other ""cross-cutting""
findings, for example the impact of changes in ownership and the
extraction of cash by shareholders on subsidies.
 - It will also argue that subsidies made before 1995 cannot
be part of a WTO dispute since the WTO agreement on subsidies
only came into effect then.
 - If the United States files a cross-appeal, which it has 12
days to do, the EU could then make further appeals conditional
on that.

 * Further delays resolution of Airbus-Boeing disputes
 * Airbus, Boeing vying for U.S. military tanker order
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, July 21 (Reuters) - The European Union said it will
appeal on Wednesday against a World Trade Organization ruling
condemning its subsidies for Airbus, prolonging a dispute with
the United States for at least several more months.
 An EU source close to the case said Brussels would hand in
its appeal shortly before a special session of the WTO's dispute
settlement body.
 The meeting, which is due to begin at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT),
was called by the United States to adopt last month's ruling by
a panel of experts in the six-year-old case. This would have
required the EU to end illegal export subsidies by Britain,
Germany and Spain for Airbus's A380 airliner within 90 days.
 ""This dispute is too important to allow the legal
misinterpretations of the panel to go unchallenged,"" Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht said in a statement.
 The appeal, which had been widely expected, followed a
decision by another WTO panel examining the EU's countersuit
against U.S. aid for Airbus rival Boeing to postpone an initial
confidential ruling until mid-September from July 16.
 Louis Gallois, chief executive of Airbus parent EADS, has
said that the delay, announced as both aerospace companies
battle for a $50 billion contract from the U.S. Pentagon for
tankers, was unfair.
 The Europeans had hoped that likely criticism of the Boeing
subsidies in that case would have undermined the U.S. company's
allegations that the EADS offer, based on the Airbus A330 plane,
was possible only because of the EU subsidies.
 WTO appellate judges must rule within 60 days under an
accelerated timetable for prohibited subsidies, but in a complex
case like this they could well take longer.
 After that, if the United States believes the EU is not
complying with the ruling within a mutually agreed period, it
can launch a further compliance case. Meanwhile, the rulings in
the dispute over Boeing aid will be issued.
 As a result many trade lawyers believe the dispute -- over
dominance in a market that the companies believe will be worth
$3 trillion over 20 years -- will ultimately be settled through
negotiations between the two sides, as Airbus and the EU
Commission have called for.

(Updates with U.S. markets close)
 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - World stocks staged a
late-day surge to end higher on Tuesday and Treasury prices
pared gains, reversing steep losses as bargain hunters emerged
amid speculation the Federal Reserve will take steps to spur
lending.
 For much of the day, investors had been focused on
lower-than-estimated revenues at major U.S. companies and a
drop in U.S. housing starts intensified worries the economic
recovery was losing momentum.
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , Johnson & Johnson
, International Business Machines Corp.  and
Texas Instruments Inc.  have posted quarterly revenues
that fell shy of expectations against the backdrop of
disappointing economic news.
 Late Tuesday, investors bought the beaten-down shares of
Goldman, driving them up 2.2 percent to settle at $148.91.
 Goldman, the heavyweight investment bank, said its
earnings slid 82 percent in the second quarter, hampered by
its settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the UK's payroll tax. Profit dropped to $613
million from $3.44 billion, while revenue slid 36 percent to
$8.84 billion. For more details see [ID:nN19184420]
 Market sentiment also moved in sympathy with U.S. markets
on speculation over what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
could announce in his semi-annual congressional testimony on
Wednesday, including the possibility of a further loosening of
monetary policy.
 ""The market is getting a boost here on a story from
somewhere that the Fed is going to announce that they will
stop paying interest on reserves where they are currently
paying .25 percent,"" Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at
Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, wrote in an email to clients.
""This would be the Fed's attempt to force banks to lend money
instead of parking it at the Fed. In my opinion, this is the
last bullet in the gun of the Fed and therefore is not going
to be used so soon.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 75.53 points,
or 0.74 percent, to close at 10,229.96. The benchmark Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> advanced 12.23 points, or 1.14
percent, to end at 1,083.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index
<.IXIC> climbed 24.26 points, or 1.10 percent, to 2,222.49.
 That said, investors still hedged themselves with exposure
to gold, as the yellow metal rose more than 1 percent to top
$1,190 an ounce.
 Economic data on housing has continued to curb optimism of
a strong recovery.
 U.S. housing starts hit their lowest level in eight months
in June, but a rise in building permits offered hope that home
building was poised to pick up.
 The Commerce Department said on Tuesday housing starts
dropped 5.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
549,000 units, the lowest since October. It was the second
straight month of declines in groundbreaking activity and was
well below market expectations for a 580,000-unit rate.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.45
percent and the Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> also climbed 0.45 percent.
 European stocks broke a week-long losing streak as mining
stocks climbed along with metal prices. Spanish stocks such as
Santander  also rallied, helped by Spain's successful
Treasury bill auction that eased worries over the country's
ability to tap the debt market.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed 0.04 percent higher at 1,006.64 points.
 But Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index <.N225> shed 1.15
percent, reflecting investor concern about a U.S. slowdown.
 Investor sentiment was also undermined when Hungary sold
less of its debt than expected, days after its talks with
international lenders were suspended.
 EURO TAKES A BREATHER
 The euro was lower, reversing a climb to its highest
against the dollar in more than two months.
 It retreated from $1.3029 hit on trading platform EBS as
some investors questioned whether the single currency would
sustain gains above $1.30, given that European bank stress
test results due on Friday may reveal weakness in euro-zone
financial institutions.
 The poor demand at Hungary's debt offer also stung the
euro as it weighed on risk sentiment.
 ""We've seen risk appetite claw back a fair amount, and the
market is questioning whether that move is valid,"" said Jane
Foley, director of research at Forex.com.
 In New York trading, the euro  was down 0.39 percent
at $1.2889 from a previous session close of $1.2940.
 The dollar was higher against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
up 0.31 percent at 82.766 from a previous session close of
82.513. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up
0.80 percent at 87.42 from a previous session close of
86.730.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher, with the yield on
the two-year note touching a record low.
 The two-year Treasury note  yield briefly hit a
low of 0.5764 percent, according to Reuters data. It was last

 TORONTO/OTTAWA, July 20 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar
zoomed nearly a penny higher against the U.S. dollar on
Tuesday, taking its cue from firming equity and commodity
markets and looking past a slightly more subdued outlook on the
world economy issued by the Bank of Canada.
 A rise in oil prices also played a role, pushing the
commodity-linked currency  to a session high of
C$1.0435 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.83 U.S. cents. [O/R]
 North American stock markets reversed losses made early in
the day on disappointing U.S. housing starts data for June and
weaker-than-expected revenues by IBM and Texas Instruments.
[.N] [ID: nN20249501] and closed convincingly higher.
 ""That's put investors in a little bit better of a mood and
that's what you're seeing reflected in the traditional risk
trades like long Canadian dollars and maybe a bit of an uptick
in bond yields,"" said David Tulk, senior macro strategist at TD
Securities.
 The Canadian dollar  ended at C$1.0448 to the U.S.
dollar, or 95.71 U.S. cents, up from Monday's finish of
C$1.0549 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.80 U.S. cents.
 The currency failed to find support early in the session --
after the central bank raised interest rates 25 basis points to
0.75 percent -- largely because the bank warned the economic
recovery at home and abroad will be slower than thought,
foreshadowing a more hesitant pace of rate hikes from now on.
[ID:nN20251478]
 Canada's blistering growth rate and jobs growth had led
primary securities dealers to unanimously predict Tuesday's
rate hike, which put Canada leagues ahead of the U.S. Federal
Reserve and other G7 central banks that are not yet ready to
end the era of easy money.
 ""We were a bit surprised by the fact that they did not
address the strength of the labor market. Actually, we are the
only G7 country where the employment level is now around its
pre-recession one,"" said Yanick Desnoyers, economist at
National Bank Financial in Montreal.
 ""There was a lack of conviction clearly in this press
release ... but we still think that domestic developments
should be strong enough going forward.""
 Canada's primary securities dealers forecast unanimously on
Tuesday that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates for a
third time this year in September, but most expect a pause in
the credit tightening cycle sometime in the fourth quarter.
[CA/POLL]
 BOND PRICES REVERSE GAINS
 Canadian government bond prices erased earlier gains as a
steep late-afternoon rally in North American equities put
riskier assets back in favor.
 Second thoughts about the Bank of Canada's statement
earlier in the day also weighed.
 ""Ultimately given that it wasn't as much of a deviation as
maybe people had feared that when you get back to the business
of the risk trade then that was a more important dynamic over
the the afternoon,"" said TD's Tulk.
 Canada's two-year bond  slipped 8 Canadian cents
to yield 1.578 percent, while the 10-year bond  fell
30 Canadian cents to yield 3.202 percent.
 Canadian bonds underperformed U.S. Treasuries across the
curve. The Canadian 10-year bond was 24.8 basis points above
the comparable U.S. bond, compared with 20.4 basis points in
the previous session.

(Updates prices)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro retreated from a
10-week high against the dollar on Tuesday as investors locked
in profits on recent euro gains ahead of European bank stress
test results.
 Traders pushed the euro to $1.3029 overnight but were
reluctant to take it higher for fear that the stress test
results due Friday would show some banks need to raise more
capital.
 The euro traded at $1.2894, down 0.4 percent. Disappointing
quarterly results from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and some other
companies initially rattled U.S. stock markets and took the
euro as low as $1.2840, before it pared losses slightly.
 ""We've had three recent attempts above $1.30, and the
euro's come back each time,"" said Camilla Sutton, senior FX
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""Markets are looking
for a catalyst to take it back up or push it down, and as long
as the stress tests come out as expected with no big surprises,
we could make a temporary new high above $1.30.""
 Some analysts say the test results could soothe concerns
about how European banks would cope with a deterioration in the
region's economy and financial markets. Some in the market say
banks may not pass the test.
 Though nationalized German lender Hypo Real Estate is
expected to fail, a source said on Monday, analysts said
results may still be positive for the euro because signs of
weakness would demonstrate the test's validity.
 ""If all of the banks passed, the market would say the tests
were unrealistic,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 DOLLAR'S DWINDLING YIELD ADVANTAGE
 Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.7 percent to 87.36 yen
after hitting a seven-month low of 86.27 on EBS on Friday.
 Recent yen strength has prompted market investors to
consider how Japanese authorities may deal with a firmer
currency. Traders suspect they may not want to see the 85-yen
level breached, though many doubt Tokyo is ready to intervene.
 Traders said dollar weakness is partly a function of fading
expectations for a U.S. interest rate hike in 2010.
 The euro has rallied more than 5 percent so far this month
on easing concern about the euro zone debt crisis and after
weak U.S. economic news eroded the dollar's yield appeal.
 The yield on the two-year Treasury note touched a record
low on Tuesday after the government reported U.S. housing
starts hit their lowest level in eight months in June. The data
was further evidence the economy has lost steam.
 The Canadian dollar rose about 0.7 percent to C$1.0472 per
U.S. dollar on Tuesday after the Bank of Canada raised interest
rates for the second time in two months.
 However, the bank cautioned that the domestic and global
recoveries will be slower than previously expected, which
traders said makes future hikes less certain and could take
some shine off the Canadian dollar.
 Euro declines picked up speed after Hungary sold a smaller
amount of three-month Treasury bills than originally planned.
 This contrasted with smoother debt auctions elsewhere.
Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros in bonds on Tuesday, weathering
a ratings cut by Moody's, while Spain and Greece found buyers
for shorter-term paper in further signs of recovering demand
for peripheral euro zone debt.

 * Was unwilling to pay for a closed refinery
 * Shell says no formal bids were made
(Adds comments)
 CALGARY, Alberta, July 20 (Reuters) - Delek US Holdings Inc
 is willing to reopen talks with Royal Dutch Shell Plc
 on acquiring the Montreal East refinery Shell plans to
close, an executive with the refining firm told a Canadian
parliamentary committee on Tuesday.
 Delek, an arm of Israel's Delek Group , walked
away from negotiations to acquire the 77-year-old refinery last
month because the facility required major maintenance that
would have left it inoperable for months, Jim Boles, Delek's
head of business development, told a committee examining
Shell's plans to convert the refinery into a fuel terminal.
 ""The discussions are over,"" Boles said. ""We are prepared to
recommence new discussions ... The deal is dead. We are ready
to go back to the table on a new deal.""
 Shell announced plans to close the 130,000 barrel-per-day
refinery in January after finding no suitable buyer. But, at
the request of the Quebec government, it gave potential suitors
more time to make proposals with the assistance of a
government-appointed special committee.
 Delek entered into negotiations but did not make a formal
offer because, Boles said, major maintenance would be required
to allow the refinery to operate safely. That would have meant
closing the plant until the spring, when the equipment and
personnel needed for the work would be available.
 ""We are not going to pay C$150 million ($143 million) for a
closed refinery,"" Boles said.
 Shell officials also appeared at the committee on Tuesday
and were grilled by sometimes hostile politicians on the
decision to close the refinery.
 Richard Oblath, Shell's vice-president responsible for
merger, acquisition and divestment activities, said that in
addition to 100 contacts made by the special committee, the
company talked to 25 potential buyers and six of those
progressed to more detailed negotiations.
 ""Out of all of these, only Delek US, a credible refinery
operator, came forward with a viable expression of interest,
Oblath said in opening remarks. ""However, after constructive
and good faith negotiations, Delek unfortunately withdrew from
the process.""
 Shell said any buyer would have to finance the acquisition,
and require as much as C$500 million for working capital and
another C$600 million for needed capital investments.
 Oblath, in a follow up statement, said Shell remains
willing to sell the refinery for between C$150 million and
C$200 million and said the need for a maintenance turnaround
was disclosed to would-be buyers.
 ""We delayed the turnaround that was originally scheduled to
occur in September 2009 to allow the sales process to occur,""
Oblath said in the emailed statement. ""But now we must take
steps to shut down the refinery, not because of a shortage of
supply, but for safety ... Delek did not want to conduct the
turnaround.""

on Tuesday his administration was pushing the U.S. Senate to
move forward on a defense industry trade agreement with
Britain.
 Obama addressed the issue at a joint news conference with

 ""I told David that my administration's working hard with

 Then-President George W. Bush and former British Prime

bureaucratic barriers and export license requirements between
their defense industries.
 The pact has languished in the U.S. Senate, which must
approve it before it goes into effect.
 The defense trade agreement meshes with the Obama
administration's push to liberalize export controls, as it
seeks to increase U.S. exports.
 A similar pact with Australia, also signed in 2007, has
also not received Senate approval.

Wednesday to agree on a suspension of the voting rights of
European Union states that break the 27-nation bloc's budget
deficit limits, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said.
 Schaeuble will meet his counterpart, Finance Minister
Christine Lagarde, and attend a French cabinet meeting as part
of efforts by the two allies to improve policy cordination.
 He told the business daily Les Echos the EU treaty may have
to be amended to enable a temporary suspension of the voting
rights of deficit sinners.
 EU finance ministers have so far failed to reach a consensus
on the German proposal, which agreeing to strengthen financial
penalties against countries that fail to respect the deficit
ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
 ""It is clear that we have to make other proposals, possibly
accepting the modification of the treaty. Many say it is a long
process, but we have to consider that we cannot be limited to
only financial (sanctions) measures,"" Schaeuble said in an
interview to be published on Wednesday.
 ""We have to take into account non-financial instruments such
as the temporary suspension of voting rights to make sure member
states respect the (bloc's) stability pact,"" he said.
 ""As such, a modification of the treaty is neccesary.""
 France has given lukewarm support to the German idea so far
and made clear it does not see an early amendment of the Lisbon
treaty as feasible. The EU wrangled for years over reforming its
institutions and the Lisbon treaty only entered into force last
November after a second referendum in Ireland.
 Schaeuble will be the first minister from a foreign country
to attend a French cabinet meeting. Lagarde attended a German

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro slipped from a more
than two-month high against the dollar on Tuesday as falling
equities hit risk appetite, prompting investors to book profits
ahead of the results from stress tests on European banks.
 Investors questioned whether the currency would sustain
gains above $1.30 given that the stress test results due on
Friday may show weakness in some euro zone banks. The euro
retreated after hitting $1.3029 on electronic trading platform
EBS.
 Losses in the euro were limited as U.S. stocks came off
session lows after coming under pressure on disappointing
quarterly results from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and some other
big companies.
 ""We've just seen a decent round of profit-taking. There is
concern about the stress tests results,"" said John McCarthy,
director of foreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in
New York. ""We've touched a high of almost $1.3030. People said
that's enough for the euro for the time being.""
 In midday New York trading, the euro traded 0.3 percent
lower at $1.2903. Against the yen, the euro rose 0.3 percent to
112.57.
 Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman, said a report by Spanish media quoting Spain's
economy minister, Elena Salgado, that all Spanish banks had
passed the stress tests helped the euro pare losses.
 ""For now, the market is unwilling to push the euro
aggressively either way ahead of Friday, and seems to have
carved out a near-term trading range around $1.27 and $1.30
that's held since July 14,"" he said.
 The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 87.23 yen, though it
remained near a seven-month low of 86.27 hit on EBS on Friday.
 Recent yen strength has prompted market investors to
consider how Japanese authorities may deal with a firmer
currency. Traders suspect they may not want to see the 85-yen
level breached in a hurry, though many doubt Tokyo is ready to
intervene.
 The U.S. dollar dropped 0.3 percent against the Canadian
currency at C$1.0519. The Bank of Canada raised interest rates
for the second time in two months, but cautioned that the
domestic and global recoveries will be slower than previously
expected.
 DEBT AUCTIONS, HOUSING DATA
 Declines in the euro accelerated after Hungary sold a
smaller amount of three-month Treasury bills than originally
planned.
 This contrasted with smoother debt auctions elsewhere.
Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros in bonds on Tuesday, weathering
a ratings cut by Moody's, while Spain and Greece found buyers
for shorter-term paper in further signs of recovering demand

 The euro had rallied more than 5 percent so far this month
on easing concern about the euro zone debt crisis and after
weak U.S. economic news eroded the dollar's yield appeal.
 ""U.S. yields continue to sink and that's undermined the
dollar's support a bit,"" said ING's McCarthy.
 The yield on the two-year Treasury note touched a record
low on Tuesday after the government reported U.S. housing
starts hit their lowest level in eight months in June. The data
was further evidence that the economy lost momentum, but a rise
in permits offered hope that homebuilding was poised to pick
up.
 Some in the market say results of the European Union bank
stress tests could soothe market concerns about the region's
banking system, though some banks may not pass the test.
 Nationalized German lender Hypo Real Estate is expected to
fail the test, a source said on Monday.
 Analysts said that even if some banks failed the test, the
results would be overall positive for the euro because signs of
weakness would demonstrate the test's validity.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - World stocks dropped
and Treasuries prices rallied on Tuesday after
lower-than-estimated revenue at Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
and a drop in U.S. housing starts intensified worries the U.S.
economic recovery was losing momentum.
 Goldman Sachs' earnings slid 82 percent in the second
quarter, hampered by its settlement with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and the UK's payroll tax. Profit
dropped to $613 million from $3.44 billion, while revenue slid
36 percent to $8.84 billion. For more details see
[ID:nN19184420]
 The heavyweight investment bank followed technology
bellwethers International Business Machines Corp.  and
Texas Instruments Inc.  in posting quarterly revenue
that fell shy of expectations.
 ""Both the stock and bond markets are telling you that we
are in for sluggish growth,"" said Margaret Patel, the senior
portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Funds who oversees both
equities and fixed-income assets.
 Economic data on housing didn't help the sour sentiment.
 U.S. housing starts hit their lowest level in eight months
in June, but a rise in building permits offered hope that
homebuilding was poised to pick up.
 The Commerce Department said on Tuesday housing starts
dropped 5.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
549,000 units, the lowest since October. It was the second
straight month of declines in groundbreaking activity and was
well below market expectations for a 580,000-unit rate.
 During the first hour of New York trading, the Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> was down 106.26 points, or 1.05

percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index <.N225> shedding
1.15 percent, reflecting investor concern about a U.S.
slowdown.
 Investor sentiment was also undermined when Hungary sold
less of its debt than expected, days after its talks with
international lenders were suspended.
 EURO TAKES A BREATHER
 The euro was lower, reversing a climb to its highest
against the dollar in more than two months.
 It retreated from $1.3029 hit on trading platform EBS as
some investors questioned whether the single currency would
sustain gains above $1.30, given that bank stress test results
due on Friday may reveal weakness in euro zone financial
institutions.
 The poor demand at Hungary's debt offer also stung the euro
as it weighed on risk sentiment.
 ""We've seen risk appetite claw back a fair amount, and the
market is questioning whether that move is valid,"" said Jane
Foley, director of research at Forex.com.
 In New York trading, the euro  was down 0.43 percent
at $1.2884 from a previous session close of $1.2940.
 The dollar was higher against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
up 0.3 percent at 82.757 from a previous session close of
82.513. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.33
percent at 87.05 from a previous session close of 86.730.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher, with the yield on
the two-year note reaching a record low.
 The two-year Treasury note  yield briefly touched
a low of 0.5764 percent, according to Reuters data. It was last
trading unchanged in price and yielding 0.59 percent, down from

Tuesday it will review expiring tariffs on Chinese hand pallet
trucks after a request to extend them from European producers.
 Production of the hand-operated trucks, used to move heavy
loads, is a niche sector worth about 125 million euros ($161.5
million) in annual European sales. It employs around 300 people.
 Anti-dumping import tariffs, worth up to 46.7 percent, have
been in place for five years and were due to expire on 22 July.
 ""The applicants present evidence that, should measures be
allowed to lapse, the current import level... is likely to
increase,"" the EU said in its Official Journal.
 The request came from Italy's Lifter and Sweden's BT
Products AB, a subsidiary of Toyota Industries Corp.
 Sweden is a traditional free-trade advocate and the move
highlights Europe's growing unease about Chinese imports which
have been encouraged by a weak yuan.
 It underscores concerns Chinese exporters may be aiming for
a higher share in the more lucrative electrical pallet sector.
 Europe's steel industry has also alleged that Chinese
producers receive state discounts on key inputs such as steel.
 ""We would like to see free trade but when the trucks are
imported for less than the value of the steel they're made of,
then there is something wrong,"" Hakan Dahllos, President of
Toyota Material Handling Europe, told Reuters by telephone.
 The EU's executive Commission now has up to 15 months to
decide whether to scrap the duties or renew them for up to five
years. Duties will stay in place during this time.
 Chinese officials in Brussels could not be reached for
comment.

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell from a more
than two-month high against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday as
tumbling equity prices hit appetite for risk, prompting
investors to book profits ahead of the results from stress
tests on European banks.
 The euro retreated from $1.3029 hit on electronic trading
platform EBS as investors questioned whether the currency would
sustain gains above $1.30 given that test results due on Friday
may show weakness in some euro zone banks.
 U.S. stocks came under pressure after quarterly earnings
reports from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and others disappointed
investors.
 ""We've just seen a decent round of profit-taking. There is
concern about the stress tests results,"" said John McCarthy,
director of foreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in
New York. ""We've touched a high of almost $1.3030. People said
that's enough for the euro for the time being.""
 In early New York trading, the euro traded 0.6 percent
lower at $1.2863. Against the yen, the euro was down 0.3
percent at 111.86.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 86.96 yen, but stayed near a
seven-month low of 86.27 hit on EBS on Friday.
 Yen strength has prompted market investors to consider how
Japanese authorities may deal with a firmer currency. Traders
suspect they may not want to see the 85-yen level breached in a
hurry, though many doubt Tokyo is ready to intervene.
 Market participants will be keen to see if the dollar falls
to a 15-year low by breaching the November 2009 trough of
84.81, according to Reuters data.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent against the Canadian currency
at C$1.0566.
 The Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the second
time in two months, but cautioned that the domestic and global
recoveries will be slower than previously expected.
 DEBT AUCTIONS, HOUSING DATA
 Declines in the euro accelerated after Hungary sold a
smaller amount of three-month Treasury bills than originally
planned.
 This contrasted with smoother debt auctions elsewhere.
Ireland sold 1.5 billion euros in bonds on Tuesday, weathering
a ratings cut by Moody's, while Spain and Greece found buyers
for shorter-term paper in further signs of recovering demand
for peripheral euro zone debt. See
 The euro had rallied more than 5 percent so far this month
on easing concern about the euro zone debt crisis and after
weak U.S. economic news eroded the dollar's yield appeal.
 ""I wouldn't be surprised to see buying interest down below
$1.28,"" said ING's McCarthy. ""U.S. yields continue to sink and
that's undermined the dollar's support a bit.""
 U.S. housing starts hit their lowest level in eight months
in June, data showed on Tuesday, further evidence the economy
lost momentum, but a rise in permits offered hope that
homebuilding was poised to pick up.
 Some in the market say results of the European Union bank
stress tests could soothe market concerns about the region's
banking system, though some banks may not pass the test.
 Nationalized German lender Hypo Real Estate is expected to
fail the test, a source familiar with the matter said on
Monday.
 Analysts said that even if some banks failed the test, the
results would be overall positive for the euro on the view that
signs of weakness would demonstrate the test's validity.
 ""That would mean the test scenarios are working. If all of
the banks passed, the market would say the tests were
unrealistic,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.

 * Previous forecast was flat output vs 2009 
 * April-May output posts growth, first time in 15 months

(Adds background, comment)
 By Marilyn Gerlach and Tom Kaeckenhoff
 FRANKFURT, July 20 (Reuters) - Germany's VDMA engineering
association raised its 2010 output forecast and now expects
production volumes to grow, thanks to a flood of orders from
China and emerging markets, its president said.
 ""Since August 2009...it has been moving upwards in the
engineering machinery production from month to month"", Manfred
Wittenstein told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
 ""The German machine and plant engineering sector is
apparently recovering from the crisis faster than expected. The
VDMA is therefore raising its production output forecast to 3
percent growth in real terms for 2010,"" he added.
 VDMA previously expected output to stagnate this year
compared with 2009, when it fell by about a quarter to 151
billion euros ($195.9 billion) and capacity utilisation dropped
to a record low of 69 percent.
 The revised guidance comes after new orders for the German
engineering sector rose by a record 61 percent in May, driven
mainly by orders from abroad.
 Companies such as Siemens, ThyssenKrupp and MAN SE count
among the biggest names in the sector, the largest industrial
employer in the euro zone's biggest economy and a key pillar
that made Germany the world's top exporter until it was unseated
by China last year.
 The IFO think-tank last month raised its 2010 growth
forecast for Germany while the government said the economic
recovery should strengthen in the second half of the year.
 Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering conglomerate, in April
revised upward its profit outlook for this year and said last
month cost cuts, strong demand from emerging markets and a weak
euro should boost its core profit margin in the quarter to
end-June.
 
 BOOST FROM ASIA
 Wittenstein said demand has been strong especially in areas
of energy efficiency and electromobility, with emerging markets
in Asia building up their infrastructure in these fields.
 In textile, fluid technology, plastic and rubber technology
sectors, a jump of more than 50 percent in new orders were
recorded, he said.
 Wittenstein said production in the first five months was
down 1.3 percent compared with last year, but the sector grew in
April and May for the first time in 15 months.
 Wittenstein said the 3 percent output growth forecast had
factored in the likelihood of economic slowdown in the euro zone
but not a double-dip recession.
 ""After May, we expect a slowdown in growth rate of orders
for rest of the year,"" he said.
 While recent economic data was showing a slowdown in the
economy was on the cards, ""there was still enough upward swing
that allowed us to still raise our forecast to 3 percent.""
 The revised forecast had also taken into consideration
negative factors, such as the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. 
 ""We are worried about the debt crisis, but we are convinced
the euro zone will overcome this and that the euro will
stabilise,"" he said.
 ""I think it is beneficial if the states reduce their
deficits, as this will increase our confidence too. We need a
long-term stable relationship. We cannot do our business with
cheques bouncing around.
 He said total average sector employment was expected to be
at 900,000 this year, down from last year's 939,000.
 Speaking to Reuters Insider TV, Wittenstein said a
strengthening of China's currency will help raise wages there,
which in turn will help increase consumption in China.
 ""This means that it will be easier for price sensitive
products to be sold in China,"" Wittenstein told Insider.

 NEW DELHI, July 20 (Reuters) - Key Indian industrial
sectors have yet to respond to the government on how tariff
cuts proposed at global trade talks would affect them,
weakening negotiators' chances of success, the trade secretary
said on Tuesday.
 Rahul Khullar said he had repeatedly asked industry
associations and companies from sectors ranging from chemicals
to auto components to give their assessment of the discussions
at the Doha talks, but so far, he has had very little feedback.
 This makes it harder for Indian negotiators to gauge where
they could give some leeway in the talks and which sectors they
should protect -- and by how much, Khullar told a group of
industry representatives from various sectors.
 Reaching an agreement on tariffs and market access is key
to the talks, which have progressed only in fits and starts
since their inception in 2001 amid differences between key
economies such as the United States, China and India.
 ""I'm being candid, many of you have not bothered to come
back to us,"" Khullar, a top civil servant who is key to Indian
negotiations.
 ""The negotiations have not moved forward, so you're not in
trouble. But supposing they had? The fact that you have not
responded would only have meant that you could have got
yourselves into very deep water.""
 Khullar told Reuters in an interview on Monday there is
likely to be little movement in the Doha talks by the end of
this year, while progress in 2011 would be contingent on the
outcome of November's U.S. mid-term elections.
 One sticking point in the talks has been a demand from
Washington for developing countries such as India to abolish
tariffs entirely in some industrial sectors. Such cuts are
voluntary in the Doha negotiations.
 Khullar said Indian industry could not stonewall
discussions on lowering tariffs in certain sectors in which
Asia's third-largest economy is seen as highly competitive.
 ""You have got to be able go through your industry tariff
line by tariff line and come to a conclusion -- this I can do,
this I can't do,"" Khullar said.
 ""If all I'm going to say is no', it's not particularly
intelligent if you ask me. If you want me or my colleagues to
be intelligent negotiators you have to ultimately tell us what
we have to do, what we can do and what we can't do.""

 By Gergely Szakacs and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, July 20 (Reuters) - Hungary refused to back down
in a disagreement with its lenders over fiscal reform and a bank
tax on Tuesday with the Prime Minister saying the IMF had no
authority over how Budapest should achieve its budget goal.
 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development warned
of contagion risk from a sell-off in Hungary after Budapest's
talks with the IMF and EU were suspended over the weekend, while
the Polish and Czech prime ministers stressed the importance of
fiscal discipline.
Orban said Budapest would observe its commitment to the IMF
on meeting its budget deficit target this year but said it alone
would decide how to do that. 
 ""There is a single fact registered in this agreement (which
Hungary signed with the IMF in 2008) namely that Hungary must
have a budget deficit of 3.8 percent (of GDP) in 2010,"" Orban
told a news conference.
 ""Aside from this, on every other issue, the talks between
the IMF and Hungary have no bearing. Our agreement says nothing
about how we should achieve this target.""
 The selection and timing of measures were Hungary's
exclusive national responsibility, he said.
 Markets were calmer than on Monday but the government cut
its three-month Treasury auction offer by 10 billion forints
and the yield jumped from the previous auction, which analysts
said showed continued uncertainty over Hungary's finances.
 The forint stabilised after tumbling more than 3 percent on
Monday after talks between Budapest and the International
Monetary Fund and European Union were shelved as Hungary
rebuffed calls for tougher spending cuts.
 It was the second time the new centre-right Fidesz
government had spooked investors since taking office in May --
after officials last month suggested the country could face a
Greek-style debt crisis -- and markets remained shaky.
 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
warned of contagion although it said it expected Budapest to
agree a solution with the IMF within weeks.
""Hungary's case carries a contagion risk for other east
European countries, but they can protect themselves from this to
the extent that they continue their reforms and restructuring,""
EBRD President Thomas Mirow told Germany's Handelsblatt daily.
Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas said, after a meeting with
Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban, that fiscal stability was
crucial.
""The fiscal stabilisation of budgets is crucially important
and I am glad to know that we are all aware of this
responsibility,"" Necas said.
 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said central European
countries should all improve their fiscal performance and not
worry about short-term currency fluctuations.
 
 BANK TAX VOTE
 The forint, after plunging to levels past 291 on Monday, was
trading at around 290 at 1120 GMT but the Budapest stock market
was down 0.7 percent, after falling 2.9 percent on Monday.
 Hungarian credit default swaps, which measure the cost of
insuring a sovereign's debt against default, fell 3 basis points
after surging nearly 60 bps on Monday.
 ""Hungary will meet its undertaken international obligations.
That is what I can do in the interest of markets. (They shall)
use it as they see fit,"" Orban told the same press conference.
 The government is determined to go ahead with a vote this
week on a bank tax, which it says would raise 200 billion
forints in both 2010 and 2011.
 Orban told his Fidesz party MPs that the government would
not back down in a disagreement with lenders over the tax,
according to daily Nepszabadsag. He also said the government
would not impose austerity measures, either before or after
municipal elections due on Oct. 3.
 Analysts say the government could be playing for time by
seeking to put off unpopular announcements about spending cuts
until after the municipal elections.
 Lenders said after the talks were suspended on Saturday that
the government needed to take sustainable structural measures,
including on spending, to meet its deficit targets of 3.8
percent of GDP this year and below 3 percent in 2011. Hungary
ran a deficit of 4 percent of GDP last year and the government
says it needs the bank tax to meet this year's goal.
 ""The big picture is 2011 ... there is a lot of economic
adjustment necessary and that should not be achieved through a
short-term distortive measure like the bank levy,"" the IMF's
Mission chief Christoph Rosenberg told Reuters.
The IMF said on Monday it remained open for talks with the
Hungarian government, while Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy
said he expected lenders to return in September.
 Analysts said a surge in borrowing costs and weakness in the
forint may push the government to reach a deal sooner.
 ""Self-confident government statements would not be a
surprise in the next few days,"" Commerzbank said.
 ""However, we do not think that the government will
ultimately risk a failure of the negotiations. The consequences
for the forint and the Hungarian economy would be too severe.""
 Without a deal with lenders, Hungary will not be able to use
remaining funds in a 20 billion euro loan, which was secured in
2008 to save the country from financial meltdown.
 Even though the government is not under immediate financing
pressure, such a delay would raise its financing costs and
further erode investor confidence in Hungarian assets.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday,
reversing a climb to its highest against the dollar in more than
two month, as European shares fell and investors reckoned its
gains have been overdone before bank stress test results.
 The euro retreated from $1.3029 hit on trading platform EBS
as some investors questioned whether the single currency would
sustain gains above $1.30 given that stress test results due on
Friday may show weakness in euro zone financial institutions.
 Poor demand at a Hungarian Treasury bill offer also stung
the euro as it weighed on risk sentiment. In turn, the dollar
was boosted across the board, recovering from Monday's fall
against a currency basket on weak U.S. economic data.
 ""We've seen risk appetite claw back a fair amount, and the
market is questioning whether that move is valid,"" said Jane
Foley, director of research at Forex.com.
 ""There is a lot of better news priced into the euro, and
ahead of the stress tests, it's probably gone a little too far.
The market is taking some risk off the table.""
 By 1108 GMT, the euro  traded 0.3 percent lower on the
day at a session trough of $1.2903 as European shares <.FTEU3>
fell 0.5 percent. Traders saw support for the euro around the
previous day's low of $1.2870.
 Some in the market said the euro's losses accelerated after
Hungary sold a smaller amount of three-month Treasury bills than
originally planned. [ID:nBUD005418]
 This contrasted with auctions by Spain and Greece, which
sold short-dated paper without incident, while Ireland managed
to sell six- and 10-year debt -- albeit at higher yields -- a
day after Moody's downgraded its sovereign rating.
[ID:nLDE66J10W]
 
 YEN NEAR 7-MTH HIGH VS DOLLAR
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent to 86.83 yen , but stayed
near a seven-month low of 86.27 hit on EBS on Friday. Yen
strength has prompted market investors to consider how Japanese
authorities may deal with a firmer currency.
 Traders suspect they may not want to see the 85 yen level
breached in a hurry, though many doubt Tokyo is ready to
intervene at this point.
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent against the Canadian dollar
at C$1.0533. Markets expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest
rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday. [ID:nN14133612]
 The euro's winning streak paused after the single currency
had capitalised on a run of weak U.S. data, the latest of which
was a slide in July home builder confidence released on Monday.
 Some in the market say results of European Union bank stress
tests due out on Friday are expected to soothe market concerns
about the region's banking system, but others speculate some
banks will not pass the test.
 Nationalised German lender Hypo Real Estate is expected to
fail the test, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.
[ID:nLDE66I20V]
 Some analysts said that even if some banks failed the test,
overall, the results would be positive for the euro on the view
that signs of weakness would demonstrate the test's validity.
 ""That would mean the test scenarios are working. If all of
the banks passed, the market would say the tests were
unrealistic,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 But some analysts say the euro could be in for a ""buy on the
rumour sell on the fact"" retreat after the stress test results,
having risen nearly 10 percent from a four-year low against the
dollar since June 7.
 The market also awaited U.S. housing starts data for June
after data on Monday showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market
index fell more than expected in July to its lowest level since
April 2009. [ID:nN19191144]

 * UAE-Iran relations under growing strain
 
 By Raissa Kasolowsky
 DUBAI, July 20 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates central
bank governor dismissed on Tuesday reports that Iran may seek
payment in dirhams for its oil exports to Europe to get around
sanctions, saying the UAE had no time for jokes.
 An Iranian official said on Sunday Tehran was discussing
internally the idea of switching to dirhams from euros as a
possible way to deal with tougher EU sanctions that could block
Iranian transactions in the single European currency.
 ""Is this a joke? We have no time to entertain jokes,"" Sultan
Nasser al-Suweidi said in a response sent to Reuters by email by
his office following a request for comment on the reports.
 Analysts say the United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally and major
oil exporter whose ties with Iran are already strained, would
likely resist such a change given its wish to avoid being sucked
deeper into the dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions.
 Diplomatic relations between the UAE and Iran, which have
strong trade links, are growing increasingly fraught. Gulf Arab
governments sharing Western fears Iran could become a nuclear
weapons state.
 Earlier this month, the UAE ambassador to Washington
appeared to suggest that Abu Dhabi would support the U.S. using
force to stop Iran's nuclear programme, although the UAE's state
news agency later said his remarks were taken out of context.
 This year has also seen a war of words between the UAE and
Iran over three Gulf islands that both countries claim as their
territory but which are controlled by Iran. Arab states broadly
back the UAE claim to the islands, which lie close to shipping
lanes used for oil and gas export.
 The dollar is the standard currency for oil trade, but Iran
had shifted to the euro for European deals in response to many
years of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
 Last month Europe also toughened its sanctions against Iran
in a stepped-up international effort to make Tehran suspend a
nuclear programme which the West suspects is secretly designed
to develop atomic bombs. Iran says it seeks only civilian energy
from its uranium enrichment process.

 BUDAPEST, July 20 (Reuters) - The European Bank for

risk from a sell-off in Hungary as Budapest appeared unwilling
to back down in a disagreement with international lenders over
fiscal reform and a bank tax.
 Markets were calmer than on Monday but the government cut

rebuffed calls for tougher spending cuts.
 ""(The auction) went okay, we were expecting it to go a touch
weaker,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura. ""The cut in size
on the 1.5 bid-to-cover shows the level of uncertainty and
caution there is under the surface at the moment around this
weekend's events and hence the tail of bids was skewed strongly
to the upside.""
 ""In many ways next week's bond auction will be more
interesting and a better take on foreigner interest,"" Montalto
said.
 A fixed income trader in Budapest said markets were pricing
in an interest rate rise for the coming months, after Hungary's
central bank said on Monday it was ready to raise rates if
necessary. 
 The forint, after plunging to levels past 291 on Monday, was

week

 * U.S. bond fund weekly inflows highest since February
 * Demand for emerging markets likely valuation driven
 HONG KONG, July 20 (Reuters) - Emerging markets were in
high demand in mid July, with bond fund inflows at a record, as
investors chose dynamic developing economies over lagging
advanced markets, EPFR Global said on Tuesday.
 Emerging market equity funds tracked by EPFR posted
combined inflows of more than $3 billion for the week ended
July 14, while emerging market bond funds took in $745 million,
bringing their year-to-date inflows to an all-time high of
$18.5 billion.
 While fears about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis have
abated somewhat in the run up to the release of bank stress
test results on Friday, a flurry of weak U.S. economic data and
the impact of China's measures to cool its economy have sapped
willingness to take risks for higher returns.
 However, quarterly earnings reports have been positive
enough for investors to dive back into emerging markets stocks
and bonds across the world.
 EMERGING MARKET EQUITIES:
 Desire to own the fund group was indiscriminate. Global
emerging market equity funds absorbed the highest inflows since
the third week of October.
 Asia ex-Japan, Latin America and Europe, Middle East &
Africa fund groups all posted inflows.
 India equity funds alone took in $114 million, a 13-week
high.
 DEVELOPED MARKET EQUITIES:
 Flows into developed market stock funds were not heavy.
 The majority of the $1.86 billion that poured into U.S.
equity funds went to a handful of large-cap blend ETFs, masking
the outflow from other sub-fund groups.
 Japan-focused funds suffered $171 million in outflows.
 Europe-funds also had outflows despite interest in UK,
German and France equity funds.
 SECTOR FUNDS:
 Commodity sector funds were the biggest recipients of
inflows, and energy sector funds were the only other fund group
to take in over $250 million during the week. Interest in
exposure to gold has been a boon to the commodity sector.
 By contrast, consumer goods sector funds saw the biggest
outflows.
 FIXED INCOME FUNDS:
 Flows into emerging market bond funds on a year-to-date
basis have sought local currency fixed income more than hard
currency. Domestic currency bond funds have had inflows of $9.9
billion compared with $4 billion of inflows to hard currency
paper.
 In the week to July 14, U.S. bond funds took in $2.97
billion, the biggest weekly gain since February 24.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro eased a bit after
hitting a two-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, but
remained supported as weak U.S. economic data hurt the
greenback.
 The euro rose as high as $1.3029 on trading platform EBS,
with dealers saying key stop-losses -- closing of positions to
cap loss-making trades -- had been taken out around $1.3010,
with more above $1.3030. By 0929 GMT, it was up 0.1 percent on
the day at $1.2955.
 Support for the euro is seen around the previous day's low
of $1.2870. Resistance is seen around $1.3113, a Fibonacci
retracement of its decline from last December to early June.
 ""Sentiment toward the euro is quite positive,"" said Lutz
Karpowitz, senior currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 ""The short-term sovereign debt problems seem to be under
control, and data out of the U.S. is weighing on the dollar.""
 Traders said that options at a strike price of $1.2950 and
$1.3000 set to expire later in the day may limit the upside.
 Risk sentiment grew after Chinese shares rose 2 percent but
European shares reversed course and were down 0.6 percent by
midday trade.
 Results of European Union bank stress tests due out on
Friday are expected to soothe market concerns about the region's
banking system, even though some banks are not expected to pass
the test.
 Nationalised German lender Hypo Real Estate is expected to
fail the test, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.

 ""That would mean the test scenarios are working. If all of
the banks passed, the market would say the tests were
unrealistic,"" Commerzbank's Karpowitz said.
 The euro has also shrugged off potentially damaging news
such as Ireland's debt downgrade by Moody's ratings agency on
Monday and a breakdown in talks between Hungary and
international lenders at the weekend.
 But some analysts say the euro could be in for a ""buy on the
rumour sell on fact"" retreat after the stress test results,
having risen nearly 10 percent from a four-year low.
 ""While we would expect the euro to extend gains towards the
$1.3115 area over the next couple of days ... the euro is likely
to struggle from here given the recent strong gains over the
course of the past month,"" BNP analysts said in a note.
 
 YEN NEAR 7-MTH HIGH
 The yen remained near a seven-month high against the dollar,
prompting market players to look to what authorities in Japan
could do about a firmer yen.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent on the day at 86.83 yen, but
not far from a low of 86.27 hit on trading platform EBS on
Friday.
 Traders suspect Japanese officials would not want to see the
85 level breached in a hurry, though many traders doubt Tokyo is
ready to intervene at this point.
 ""I guess the authorities will be nervous. There will be
verbal intervention or they might do rate checks as they did
before. But I don't think they can do actual intervention,"" said
a trader at a Japanese financial institution.
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent against the Canadian dollar
at C$1.0514. Markets expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest
rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday.
 The market was also awaiting the release of U.S. housing
starts data for June after data on Monday showed the NAHB/Wells
Fargo Housing Market index fell more than expected in July to
its lowest level since April 2009.
 The Australian dollar rose 1.1 percent to $0.8778. It
recovered on rising Chinese shares after losing ground as
minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's July policy meeting
suggested it was unlikely to raise interest rates next month if
coming inflation data moderated as expected.

 * Anger is directed at annual U.S. ""Special 301"" report
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - AIDS groups on Tuesday
accused the United States of violating the health rights of
millions of poor people around the world through trade policies
that make it harder for them to get life-saving drugs.
 A coalition that includes Health Gap, the Foundation for
AIDS Rights and the Thai Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS
formally asked Anand Grover, the UN Special Rapporteur on the
Right to Health, to look into the matter.
 The special rapporteur can respond to alleged violations by
asking the concerned government to clarify its policies,
reminding it of health right obligations and requesting
information on any corrective action the government is taking.
 The groups were to hold a press conference at the
International AIDS Conference in Vienna on Tuesday.
 Their ire is directed at an annual report produced by the
U.S. Trade Representative's office that ranks countries with
the worst records on protecting U.S. intellectual property
rights for goods ranging from CDs to medicines.
 They accused the United States of using the ""Special 301""
report to pressure countries to give up certain public health
rights they have under a World Trade Organization agreement on
intellectual property rights known as TRIPS.
 ""Up to and including the 2009 Special 301 report, Brazil,
India, Thailand and other countries were threatened with
sanctions under Special 301 for taking advantage of TRIPS
flexibilities, including utilizing transition periods and
issuing compulsory licenses"" to allow domestic firms to produce
cheaper versions of drugs patented by U.S. companies, the
groups said in their allegation letter to Grover.
 This year's Special 301 report again put Thailand on its
""priority watch list,"" one step short of its most serious
designation. The country has battled with U.S. drug companies
over steps it has taken in its aggressive anti-AIDS campaign.
 USTR also announced a special ""out-of-cycle"" review of
Thailand's intellectual property rights regime, a step praised
by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
U.S. drug industry's powerful lobby group.
 But in the same report, USTR reaffirmed its support for
countries using their TRIPS flexibilities as embodied in an
international pledge known as the Doha Declaration, which says
they are not bound by global intellectual property rights from
taking steps to deal with public health crises.
 Sean Flynn, associate director of the American University's
Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property,
accused President Barack Obama of not following through on a
campaign promise to support access to low-cost generic drugs.
 Obama's campaign literature pledged ""to break the
stranglehold that a few big drug and insurance companies have
on these life-saving drugs,"" said Flynn, who is the counsel of
record on the groups' letter to the UN special rapporteur.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2010 05:48AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Taiwan June export order growth slows as China cools," * June orders up 22.48 pct (forecast median +21.9 pct)
 * Slowest rate of increase since October 2009
 * China order growth drops fastest as tightening bites
(Adds comment)
 By Jonathan Standing
 TAIPEI, July 20 (Reuters) - Orders for Taiwan's exports
recorded the slowest pace of year-on-year growth in eight
months in June, as widely expected, adding to growing evidence
of a slowdown in demand as the global economic recovery
sputters.
 The data, a bellwether for other Asian exporting economies
such as South Korea and an indicator of global demand, came as
China said its strong growth in exports in the first half would
give way to slow growth in the second, with Europe's crisis a
cloud over demand
 Orders for Taiwan's exports, almost half of which are
electronics or communications equipment, rose 22.48 percent in
June from a year earlier, the economics ministry said on
Tuesday, just above a median forecast of 21.9 percent in a
Reuters poll but within the poll's 19.64 percent to 24.8
percent range.
 ""No doubt the pace for export orders is slowing down with
the U.S. book-to-bill ratio easing recently, so the global tech
sector can see recovery slowing,"" said Joanna Tan, economist at
Forecast Ltd in Singapore.
 ""And with the global recovery showing signs of slowing,
that will probably form the backdrop for export orders in the
coming months.""
 The book-to-bill ratio for North American manufacturers of
equipment used to make micro chips has been easing slowly since
February and was at 1.12 in May. The ratio is watched as an
indicator of the demand pipeline for the industry.
 The pace of Taiwan's order growth has fallen steadily since
peaking at 71.8 percent in January.
 The June figures showed order growth from China falling to
15.54 percent from 34.34 percent in May, an indication that
tightening policies on the mainland aimed at cooling its robust
growth were having an effect.
 ""Taiwan's export orders have much higher exposure to China
than other Southeast Asian countries,"" said Ma Tieying,
economist at DBS in Singapore.
 ""We expect Taiwan to slow down because of China and the
uncertainties in the European debt crisis.""
 Orders from the U.S. slowed to 17.44 percent growth from
May's 20.32 percent and orders from Europe slowed to 25.69
percent growth from May's 42.17 percent.
 PROFIT PRESSURES?
 Analysts expect weaker demand to hit top Asian technology
firms such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co and LG
Display and Taiwan's AU Optronics, in the second half of the
year, in part due to worries over fallout from Europe's debt
crisis and high inventories.
 Some chip firms are expanding, however, seeing strong
demand ahead from corporate PC users for desktop machines, and
other analysts noted that export orders remain firm.
 ""The value of export orders was a bit better than
expectations. June after all is a normal light season, but the
value of orders keeps going up,"" said Rehong Chuang, economist
at Sinopac Holdings in Taipei.
 ""It looks like the orders from mainland China and the
United States still aren't too bad.""
 Growth rates are also easing as the low base effect which
magnified year-on-year comparisons starts to fade. World trade
collapsed during the global financial crisis and only began to
show some signs of reviving in the middle of last year.
 The data is unlikely to alter the outlook for interest
rates in Taiwan. The central bank began raising rates last
month from a record low 1.25 percent and is expected to bump
them up gradually through next year.

 (Adds details, comment)
 ATHENS, July 20 (Reuters) - Greece on Tuesday passed its
second borrowing test since an EU/IMF funding deal in May,
selling 1.95 billion euros ($2.53 billion) of 13-week T-bills.
 The auction to roll over maturing paper was covered, but
debt-laden Greece had to pay a higher yield than in a previous
auction held earlier this year.
 PDMA said Tuesday's auction produced a yield of 4.05
percent, up from 3.65 percent in a previous April 20 auction.
The bid-cover ratio was 3.85 versus 4.61 in the April sale.
 ""Considering the circumstances, things seem to have gone
quite well,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, bond analyst at LBBW.
""With the current junk rating on its bonds, it is normal that
Greece had to pay more than in the previous auction,"" he said.
 Greece's borrowing cost was cheaper than the 5.0 percent the
debt-laden country pays to borrow under the 110 billion euro
loan that the European Union and the International Monetary Fund
put in place to calm a crisis that has shaken the euro zone.
 Greece earlier this month sold 1.625 billion euros of
26-week T-bills at a yield of 4.65 percent. About 90 percent of
the paper was bought by Greek banks, which use Greek debt as
collateral to obtain funds from the European Central Bank.

 By Wojciech Moskwa and Gwladys Fouche
 OSLO, July 20 (Reuters) - Renewable Energy Corp posted
above-forecast quarterly core earnings and said it expected a
strong 2010 as customers in some markets take advantage of solar
panel subsidies while they last.
 The Norwegian company's shares, which have rallied 27
percent since all-time lows on July 1, initially jumped 9
percent, but could not hang on to their gains as broader markets
turned negative.
 REC said it remained ""cautious"" on 2011 as a result of the
planned cuts in feed-in tariffs in Germany and Italy, although
returns for customers from new solar panels should remain
sufficiently high to drive demand.
 After a tough 2009, clean energy firms are expected to post
strong results, with REC the first big solar group to report,
although valuations have dipped recently due to the fears about
weak medium-term demand.
 REC said it expected quarter-on-quarter core earnings growth
both in the third and fourth quarters of 2010, with demand
buoyant as customers rush to purchase solar energy generators
before incentive schemes run out.
 ""Demand is very strong in Germany, and we see growth in
Italy and other markets. We anticipated prices to decline, but
they have been more steady than anticipated,"" REC Chief
Executive Ole Enger told a news conference.
 Enger told Reuters global demand for solar power would be
closer to 15 gigawatts (GW) in 2010 than REC's April view of 10
GW, highlighting the additional demand that producers hope will
pad prices amid a sharp increase in solar equipment supply.
 He also said the time was ripe for consolidation in the
solar industry, and was sure that some big companies were
looking for a way in.
 He was less upbeat about next year.
 ""One has to be cautious about 2011, especially about the
first half of 2011. We prepare for a more imbalanced market in
2011, with more supply than demand -- so we will get back to a
situation where there will be pressure on prices.""
 
 PROFIT TAKING
 Shares in REC surged this morning and at one point hit a
three-month high at 21.20 crowns, up 9.1 percent on the day.
 At 1205 GMT, REC shares were down 0.7 percent at 19.23
crowns but still outpaced a 1.1 percent fall on Oslo's index.
Shares in German solar peer Q-cells were up 0.4 percent at 5.57
euros, also paring gains from morning highs.
 ""Shares have performed quite well in the run-up to Q2
results and today's morning jump may have caused some to take
profit,"" said Fondsfinans analyst Haakon Levy. REC shares are
still down 45 percent from the start of the year.
 Fellow clean energy producer Iberdrola Renovables is
expected to post a rise in first-half core profit after the
market close on Tuesday, with focus also on the impact of
Spanish subsidy cuts for the windpower sector.
 REC's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 455 million Norwegian crowns
($72.4 million) from 218 million a year ago, beating all 19
forecasts in a Reuters poll of analysts.
 REC remained in the red on the operating level, as expected.
 ""They are putting a weak quarter behind them and confirming
that the third and fourth quarters will be strong,"" Argo
Securities analyst Henrik Schultz said.
 Handelsbanken analyst Anita Huun said she would raise her
2010 estimates for REC based on the quarterly report.

 * New steps will block oil and gas investment 
 * Moves go further than U.N sanctions adopted on June 10
 By Timothy Heritage
 BRUSSELS, July 20 (Reuters) - European Union foreign
ministers will adopt tighter sanctions against Iran next week,
including measures to block oil and gas investment and curtail
its refining and natural gas capability, EU diplomats said.
 A draft declaration prepared for a meeting of EU foreign
ministers showed they would approve a decision taken by EU
leaders on June 17 to adopt further sanctions over Tehran's
nuclear programme, and also call on Iran to resume talks.
 The measures, which go beyond steps approved by the United
Nations on June 10, are designed to put pressure on Tehran to
return to talks on its uranium enrichment programme which
Western powers believe is designed to produce nuclear weapons. 
 The draft declaration says the ministers, who meet in
Brussels on Monday, will approve the new sanctions ""in
accordance with the European Council Declaration of 17 June"",
referring to the decision taken by EU leaders at a summit.
 It said the measures were adopted ""with a view to supporting
the resolution of all outstanding concerns regarding Iran's
development of sensitive technologies in support of its nuclear
and missile programmes, through negotiation"".
 The declaration is still to be endorsed by EU ambassadors,
meeting in Brussels this week, but big changes are unlikely.
 The new EU steps focus on trade, banking and insurance,
transport including shipping and air cargo, and important
sectors of the gas and oil industry.
 EU leaders said on June 17 the energy sector sanctions would
prohibit ""new investment, technical assistance and transfers of
technologies, equipment and services related to these areas, in
particular related to refining, liquefaction and liquefied
natural gas technology"".
 Iran denies its nuclear programme is aimed at producing
weapons and says it is for energy and other peaceful purposes. 
 
 INCREASING PRESSURE ON IRAN
 The measures are intended to put strong financial pressure
on Iran, which is the world's fifth largest crude oil exporter
but has little refining capability.
 But diplomats have also acknowledged that the impact of the
sanctions will depend on steps to ensure compliance. 
 Traders said this month Iran was depending more on friendly
powers for fuel supplies because of the sanctions intended to
hinder its fuel imports, and was buying about half of its July
gasoline imports from Turkey and the rest from Chinese sellers
as most other suppliers had stopped selling.
 The foreign ministers will also back appeals by EU foreign
affairs chief Catherine Ashton for Iran to restart talks in
response to a July 6 letter from Iran's chief nuclear
negotiator, Saeed Jalili, that proposed resuming dialogue.
 ""The Council (of foreign ministers) calls on Iran to seize
this opportunity to allay the concerns of the international
community about its nuclear programme and agree on a concrete
date for talks with the EU High Representative, together with
the six countries,"" the draft declaration said. It was
referring to the six powers -- the United states, Russia, China,
Britain, France and Germany -- that are involved in discussions
on Iran's nuclear programme. 
 Jalili's proposal was the first indication that Tehran is
willing to engage with world powers on its atomic programme
since the United Nations imposed its new sanctions last month.
 The U.S. Congress has also drawn up its own set of measures
against Iran in addition to the U.N. sanctions package, parts of
which were watered down by Russian and Chinese opposition.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2010 05:08AM ET</span>",Q+A-Implications of India's proposed food security law," By Krittivas Mukherjee and Abhijit Neogy
 NEW DELHI, July 20 (Reuters) - India's ruling Congress
party is pushing for a law to subsidise grains for the poor, a
move that will impact government finances as well as political
support for the party ahead of key state elections that begin
in October.
 The bill, proposed by Congress in its election manifesto
last year, will be debated in parliament when it sits next
week. But it is uncertain whether it will be passed into law
this session.
 The proposal appears to run counter to recent reforms by
the government, which lifted subsidies on fuel prices, but aims
to partly shield a substantial voter base from surging
inflation in a country where about 40 percent of the 1.2
billion population lives below the U.N. estimated poverty line.
 Here are a few questions and answers about the bill.
 WHAT IS THE FOOD SECURITY BILL?
 Food inflation is a nagging problem in India, eating into
disposable incomes. India has 410 million people living below
the U.N. estimated poverty line of $1.25 a day. The
left-of-centre Congress, which heads India's ruling coalition,
says it wants to insulate the poor against inflation by
guaranteeing cheap grains such as rice and wheat.
The food security draft bill envisages making available 25 kg
(55 lb) of grains a month for 3 rupees (6 U.S. cents) a kg to
the poor across the country. But an advisory council headed by
powerful Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has suggested the amount
of subsidised grains per month be increased to 35 kg. The
council has also recommended that, initially, everybody in
about 150 districts, which are the poorest of the country, be
covered by the scheme. The subsidy will then be extended to the
poor in the rest of the country. These proposal are likely to
be accepted by the government.
 WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATION?
 India already provides cheap grains and pulses to nearly
180 million poor or low-income families through a public
distribution system that will cost nearly $12 billion in the
year to end-March 2011, accounting for about 1 percent of GDP
and 5 percent of total government spending.
 Although there are no official estimates yet, the new
scheme will definitely add to the subsidy burden. A Deutchse
Bank report said the incremental cost could be about $1.27
billion, raising total food subsidy costs to around 1.1 percent
of GDP in the current 2010/11 financial year and widening the
fiscal deficit.
 But Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of India's
Planning Commission, has said the proposed food security bill
will not lead to any breach of the 2010/11 fiscal deficit
target.
 The government wants to bring down the fiscal deficit to
5.5 percent of GDP in FY2010/11 from 6.9 percent in the
previous financial year.
 WHAT IS THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BILL?
 The proposed bill, a brainchild of Gandhi, is a flagship
programme of the Congress party around which it hopes to
bolster its support among the rural poor. In its first
five-year term in office in 2004, the Congress-led alliance
pushed through a rural jobs guarantee scheme benefiting
millions of people in the countryside, which largely
contributed to the party's strong election victory last year.
 The Congress is hoping the food security bill will have the
same result at a time when India's headline inflation is
hovering above 10 percent, triggering public discontent. With a
series of state elections coming up over the next year and
starting in October, the government is fearful of voter
backlash over high prices.
 The bill contrasts with Congress' push to liberalise the
economy, but the government hopes it will build a food safety
net for the poor to help cushion the blow of other reforms such
as lifting pricing controls on fuels, which will likely raise
inflation.
 The bill is expected to generate debate in parliament when
it sits on July 26, but no party is likely to oppose it the
overall idea. It is not clear, however, when parliament will
ratify the bill into law.
 WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING THE PROPOSAL?
 The existing Public Distribution System is widely seen as
inefficient with corruption leading to food meant for the poor
being diverted to retailers. Many fear a new food security
scheme may also bypass the intended beneficiaries. Tonnes of
grains are also wasted due to inadequate supply chains and lack
of storage facilities.
 But the real challenge to widening a subsidised food scheme
is an uncertain output from the country's rain-dependent
agricultural sector. India's anxiety over erratic monsoon rains
will become more acute as rising incomes and a growing
population push up demand for produce faster than supply,
turning the nation into a major importer within five years.
Growth in India's grain output has fallen back in recent years,
slowing steadily from a spectacular jump of 50 percent in the
1970s after the Green Revolution that boosted India's grain
yields.

 LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a two-month
high against the dollar on Tuesday, extending gains after
breaking past key short-term levels as weak U.S. economic data
hurt the greenback while a rise in shares supported risk-taking.
 The euro rose as far as $1.3029 on trading platform EBS,
with dealers saying key stop-losses -- closing of positions to
cap loss-making trades -- had been taken out around $1.3010,
with more above $1.3030. By 0735 GMT, it was up 0.2 percent on
the day at $1.2972.
 ""Sentiment toward the euro is quite positive,"" said Lutz
Karpowitz, senior currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 ""The short-term sovereign debt problems seem to be under
control, and data out of the U.S. is weighing on the dollar.""
 Support for the euro is seen around the previous day's low
of $1.2870. Resistance is seen around $1.3113, a Fibonacci
retracement of its decline from last December to early June.
 Traders said that options at a strike price of $1.2950 and
$1.3000 set to expire later in the day may limit the upside.
 European shares were up 0.3 percent in early trade.
 Results of euro zone bank stress tests due out on Friday are
expected to soothe market concerns about the banking system,
even though some banks are not expected to pass the test.
 Nationalised German lender Hypo Real Estate is expected to
fail the test, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.

 Commerzbank's Karpowitz said: ""That would mean the test
scenarios are working. If all of the banks passed, the market
would say the tests were unrealistic.""
 The euro has also shrugged off potentially damaging news on
Monday such as Ireland's debt downgrade by Moody's Investors
Service and a breakdown in talks between European Union member
Hungary and international lenders.
 But others say the euro could be in for a ""buy on the rumour
sell on fact"" retreat after the test results, having risen
nearly 10 percent from a four-year low, partially on hopes that
publishing them would ease worries over the euro zone generally.
 
 YEN NEAR HIGHS VS DOLLAR
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.5 percent at 112.83 yen,
after stop-losses triggered around 113.20 yen took it to the
day's high of 113.33 yen. Next target was seen around 113.50
yen.
 Traders will keep an eye on results of euro zone
peripherals' government bond auctions, including sales by
Ireland and Greece.
 Second quarter U.S. corporate earnings results such as from
Goldman Sachs and State Street, may also buoy risk-taking.
 The yen remained near a seven-month high against the dollar,
prompting market players to look to what authorities in Japan
could do about a firmer yen.
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent on the day at 86.90 yen, but
not far from a low of 86.27 hit on trading platform EBS on
Friday.
 Traders suspect Japanese officials would not want to see the
85 level breached in a hurry, though many traders doubt Tokyo is
ready to intervene at this point.
 ""I guess the authorities will be nervous. There will be
verbal intervention or they might do rate checks as they did
before. But I don't think they can do actual intervention,"" said
a trader at a Japanese financial institution.
 The U.S. dollar was down 0.3 percent against the Canadian
dollar at C$1.0507. Markets expect the Bank of Canada to raise
interest rates by 25 basis points on Tuesday.
 U.S. housing starts data is also in focus after the
NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell more than expected in
July to its lowest level since April 2009.
 The Australian dollar rose 1.1 percent to $0.8775. It
recovered on rising Chinese shares after losing ground as
minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's July policy meeting
suggested it was unlikely to raise interest rates next month if
coming inflation data moderated as expected.

 * Euro reverses after hits two-month high against dollar
 * Stocks fail to hang on to gains
 * Wall Street set for losses
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - Worries about the U.S. economic
recovery and bank exposure to risky debt combined with
disappointing earnings on Tuesday to snuff out a short stock
rally and reverse gains in the euro.
 Wall Street looked set to open lower, particularly after
Goldman Sachs issued worse than expected earnings. The firm said
second-quarter earnings fell to 78 cents a share compared to
$4.93 a year earlier.
 ""It's a pretty significant slowdown in their overall
business,"" said Walter Todd, portfolio manager for Greenwood
Capital Associates in North Carolina.
 The heavyweight investment bank followed technology
bellwethers International Business Machines and Texas
Instruments in posting quarterly revenues that fell shy of
expectations.
 There was also growing concern about the U.S. economy after
Monday's NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index for July fell
more than expected after a popular tax credit for homebuyers
expired in April.
 That underlined fears about the recovery ahead of housing
data including housing starts on Tuesday.
 Investor sentiment was also undermined when Hungary sold
less of its debt than expected, days after its talks with
international lenders were suspended.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI were down around a half a
percent with the emerging market benchmark trimming early gains
to 0.1 percent. The Thomson Reuters global stock index was down
0.4 percent.
 European stocks were heading for a five-day losing streak
with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 down 1 percent.
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index earlier shed 1.2
percent, reflecting investor concern about a U.S. slowdown.
 
 EURO REVERSES
 The euro was lower, reversing a climb to its highest against
the dollar in more than two months.
 It retreated from $1.3029 hit on trading platform EBS as
some investors questioned whether the single currency would
sustain gains above $1.30, given that bank stress test results
due on Friday may reveal weakness in euro zone financial
institutions.
 The poor demand at Hungary's debt offer also stung the euro
as it weighed on risk sentiment.
 ""We've seen risk appetite claw back a fair amount, and the
market is questioning whether that move is valid,"" said Jane
Foley, director of research at Forex.com.
 The euro was trading at $1.2851.
 German government bonds rose as the Hungary news further
boosted flight-to-safety flows.
 ""It shows that sovereign risks still remain a concern in
some areas and whilst the situation has generally improved, it
hasn't gone away,"" said Nick Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA
Capital Markets in Edinburgh.

 NEW DELHI, July 20 (Reuters) - India aims the Commonwealth
Games will be a showcase of its economic clout, but with less
than three months to go, the world's third largest sporting
event is instead laying bare its perennial infrastructure
problems.
 The Games, held ever four years and grouping athletes from
the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations, are intended to be
India's answer to the Beijing 2008 Olympics, hailed as a
success for its economic and political rival China.
 But while China set out to wow the world with iconic
structures such as the Bird's Nest stadium, many Commonwealth
Games venues in New Delhi are far from finished while others
are falling apart under the force of a few weeks of monsoon
rains.
 A shooting range built for the Games, and inaugurated two
months ago, was extensively damaged by heavy rains earlier this
month, Indian media reported. At another complex, rains felled
the false ceiling and other venues have sprung leaks.
 Shoddy construction is one of the challenges Asia's
third-biggest economy faces as it gears up to take on
big-ticket projects needed to propel growth to China's
double-digit rates.
 Analysts say one of the main problems is a government
practice of awarding contracts -- regardless of their size --
to the lowest bidders, which are often smaller, more
aggressive, but less experienced construction firms which also
lack the manpower needed to implement such projects.
 Contractors also sometimes take short-cuts when they're
running over budget or running out of time.
 This often translates into sub-standard structures, and
this is a problem that would remain even if the oft-cited
difficulties of getting land and necessary bureaucratic
clearances are solved. ""Quality, yes, there is a serious
issue in India. Developers are stretched and a lot of
sub-contacting is happening,"" said Nandita Vohra, a senior
consultant to the Asian Development Bank.
 ""Two or three levels down, one feels the supervision is not
as intense as it is needed.""
 CUTTING COSTS AND CORNERS
 India expects to spend $1 trillion, a sum roughly the size
of its GDP, between 2012 and 2017 to boost its infrastructure.
This is double of what it will spend in the five years to 2012.
 Some of this spending has been fast-tracked due to the
Games: in addition to venues, a new airport terminal is due to
open this month and new subways and roads are being built
specifically for the athletes and the hundreds of thousands of
visitors expected.
 New Delhi is also going through a makeover, with its
colonial buildings being renovated and sidewalks ripped out to
be repaved. Residents grumble about the chaos, pointing to
rubble everywhere and roads that cave in due to underground
tunnelling.
 ""The scale and ability of contractors is going to be a huge
issue and a risk for projects,"" Arvind Mahajan, an
infrastructure specialist at consultancy KPMG, told Reuters.
 ""Many of the bigger and key contractors are sold out, and
cost factors, too, are pushing people to look at these smaller
players. But if you push too much on cost, the quality would
suffer, either in terms of execution or timelines not being
adhered to,"" he added.
 The infrastructure woes dogging the Games are not the first
example of an Indian signature project going awry. Work on the
Delhi Metro, a project backed by top officials, was delayed
after an overhead bridge collapse in July 2009, killing five
workers. A month later, strong winds blew off the roof of the
new airport.
 While the construction opportunities in India are huge and
capital is plentiful, analysts rue there aren't enough
large-scale, quality projects worth financing.
 ""There is a paucity of high quality, or even quality,
projects that are financeable. It's not a question of capital
being inadequate,"" Anil Ahuja, Asia head of private equity
firm, told a recent conference as the audience nodded in
approval.

(Adds share price, details, rivals)
 By Gilles Guillaume
 PARIS, July 20 (Reuters) - French engineering group Alstom
revealed a sharp drop in orders and a slight fall in
first-quarter sales on Tuesday, with customers reluctant to
embark on big projects in an uncertain economic climate.
 The maker of industrial power plants and high-speed trains
said it was sticking to its targets for the next two years,
however, despite the 38 percent fall in comparable orders to 3.1
billion euros ($4 billion) in the quarter to June from a year
ago. Comparable sales for the period fell 5 percent to 4.743
billion euros.
 The company's shares traded 0.7 percent lower at 36.60 euros
at 0844 GMT, having already shed 25 percent this year.
 Though underlying demographic and economic trends are
expected to support power generation and rail transport, Alstom
typically lags economic recovery until customers find the
confidence and financing for big capital-intensive investments.
 ""Despite the busy tendering activity, the group still faces
challenges to register large orders as customers continue to
delay their investments in new power plants,"" Alstom Chief
Executive and Chairman Patrick Kron said in a statement.
 However, the group said the lack of large projects was
partly offset by the resilience of small and medium-sized
contracts, particularly in service and retrofit.
 It said its transport unit took in 1.1 billion euros worth
of new orders, helped by a major commercial win in Russia.
 Alstom confirmed its operating margin for the two fiscal
years 2010/11 and 2011/12 would range between 7 and 8 percent,
based on good contract execution and a gradual recovery of
demand.
 ""The new orders are below expectations in the quarter, which
is not a really big surprise because there weren't many
announcements,"" said a sector analyst.
 ""On the other hand, the Thermal Services are holding up well
and that is encouraging because they are key to support the
margins,"" he added.
 Thermal Services' clients are operators of steam, gas and
combined-cycle power plants worldwide. This includes turbines as
well as generators, boilers, environmental and total power
plants.
 Alstom said it had swung to a net debt position in the
quarter as a result of the 2.3 billion euro buy of Areva
Transmission, its dividend payment and weak new orders.
 Alstom rivals are ABB, Mitsubishi Heavy and GE in power
services and Siemens, Mitsubishi Electric and Bombardier in
trains.
 According to StarMine data, Alstom has a lower SmartEstimate
price relative to its earnings per share than rivals. Its
multiple of 9.9 compares with 12.8 for Siemens and 17.2 for ABB.

 * Governor Stevens says election would not deter action
 By Koh Gui Qing
 SYDNEY, July 20 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank has
underlined the importance of coming inflation data for its
decision next month whether to raise interest rates again, just
as the nation heads into a general election.
 In minutes of its July monetary policy meeting published on
Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also said the
outcome of stress tests on European banks due Friday could play
a part, given it could have a major impact on financial
markets.
 ""The consumer price index will be pivotal to the future
direction of interest rates,"" said Craig James, chief equity
economist at CommSec.
 ""If the result on underlying inflation is above their
expectations then clearly that would lead to questions about
whether rates needed to rise again.""
 The central bank looks at several measures of underlying
inflation to gauge trends in price pressures, aiming to keep
inflation in a 2 to 3 percent band over the very long run.
 Underlying inflation has been above 3 percent for three
years now, but the central bank believes it slowed to under 3
percent in the second quarter. If they prove prescient, then it
would greatly lessen the need for a rate rise at its August 3
meeting.
 ""The important question for the Board at the next meeting
would be whether the new information materially changed the
medium-term outlook for inflation,"" the minutes said.
 The market is betting inflation will indeed be low enough
to forestall another rise, after 150 basis points of tightening
since October last year.
 August interbank futures imply only a 22 percent chance of
a 25-basis-point rate rise next month, and about a 50-50
probability of a move by the end of the year.
 THEN THERE'S EUROPE
 However, analysts are much more divided.
 ""In our view, the report is likely to reveal an
uncomfortably high rate of underlying inflation that will
prompt another hike in the cash rate at the August meeting,""
said Felicity Emmett, a senior economist at RBS.
""Clearly, though, uncertainty around Europe remains a
stumbling block,"" she added. ""If the stress tests reveal
serious concerns about the stability of the European banking
system and global financial markets respond negatively, this
could keep the Bank on hold for longer.""
 Although the minutes showed that the bank was upbeat on the
domestic economy, it was undoubtedly cautious about growth in
Europe and the United States.
 ""For Australia, a critical medium-term question was the
extent to which economies in Asia would continue to grow
strongly in the face of what could be an extended period of
subdued conditions in the major North Atlantic economies,"" the
central bank said.
 In a speech on Tuesday, Governor Glenn Stevens said the
global outlook for next year was a bit more uncertain as some
Asian economies slow to a more sustainable pace, and European
countries tighten fiscal policy.
 Some have also speculated that the central bank might be
reluctant to tighten policy during an election campaign ahead
ov the August 21 vote.
""While the fiercely independent RBA has raised rates before
during the November 2007 election campaign, the case to move in
the current climate probably has to be pretty compelling,"" said
Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist at RBC.
 However, Governor Stevens reasserted the central bank's
independence on Tuesday, saying the board would do its job
regardless of the election.

 * Dollar near 2-mth lows vs euro on economic worries
 * Yen down on Japanese importers, intervention wariness
 * Aussie rises despite less hawkish RBA
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 20 (Reuters) - The dollar eased on Tuesday,
inching closer to a two-month low versus the euro hit last week
as investors continued to cut long positions on more
disappointing U.S. economic data.
 The greenback rose a little against the yen on bids from
Japanese importers, but remained close to a seven-month low
marked last week, leading many market players to look to what
authorities in Japan could do about a firm yen.
 The Australian dollar jumped more than 1 percent thanks to a
rise in Chinese shares as well as buying against the yen amid
wariness about Japanese yen-selling intervention.
 The Wall Street Journal reported the Bank of Japan could
consider taking additional steps to support the economy if the
yen climbs to around 85 per U.S. dollar and stays there.
 In Asian trade, the dollar rose about 0.4 percent to 87.01
yen , on buying by Japanese importers, off a seven-month
low of 86.27 hit on trading platform EBS on Friday.
 Traders suspect Japanese officials would not want to see the
85 level breached in a hurry, though many traders doubt Tokyo is
ready to intervene at this point.
 ""I guess the authorities will be nervous. There will be
verbal intervention or they might do rate checks as they did
before. But I don't think they can do actual intervention,"" said
a trader at a Japanese financial institution.
 Indeed, traders say they saw marginal yen-selling by Japanese
investors.
 ""Japanese investors' risk appetite hasn't come back. They are
not ready to sell the yen yet. It's hard to expect upside for the
dollar/yen,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 Demand for the dollar waned further on Monday after the
NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell more than expected in
July to its lowest level since April 2009, after a popular tax
credit for homebuyers expired in April. [ID:nN19191144]
 The report was the latest in a string of data that has
flashed warnings about the state of the U.S. economy and quashed
expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.
 If Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke drops any hint of further easing
at testimony on Wednesday it could push the dollar down further,
some traders said.
 ""The overall bearish setup remains intact for dollar/yen,""
JPMorgan said in a morning report. ""This follows last week's
breakdown below the key 87.00/22 yen support zone while affirming
the intermediate term bearish setup and a closer test of the
84.82 November 2009 cycle low.""
 The euro  edged up 0.15 percent to $1.2963/64, not far
from a two-month high of $1.3008 hit last Friday.
 Traders expect the pair to trade in a $1.28-1.31 range in the
coming days ahead of EU stress test results for banks and Fed
chief Bernanke's testimony.
 Support for the euro is seen around the previous day's low of
$1.2870. Resistance comes in at Friday's high of $1.3008, while
some traders say a break of that level could push it to around
$1.3113, a Fibonacci retracement of its decline from last
December to early June.
 The results of stress tests on 91 European banks are due on
Friday and there is a consensus building in the forex market that
it could be positive for the euro.
 Bankers and officials in Greece, Spain and Belgium joined a
chorus of countries expecting their banks to pass the stress
tests, but doubts linger over whether the checks are tough or
transparent enough. [ID:nLDE66I14A]
 Some traders suspect the euro could be in for a ""buy on the
rumour sell on fact"" retreat, after having risen nearly 10
percent from a four-year low, mostly shrugging off negative news
on the euro zone.
 It brushed aside news that Moody's had cut Ireland's debt
rating and concerns that negotiations between Hungary and
international lenders had broken down. [ID:nLDE66I0FY]
[ID:nLDE66H021].
 Meanwhile, the Aussie  rose 1.1 percent to $0.8775
and 1.4 percent to 76.38 yen , helped by an upbeat mood
in Chinese share markets and wariness about Japanese yen-selling
intervention.
 The Australian dollar quickly recovered the ground it had
lost after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA)
July policy meeting that suggested it was unlikely to raise
interest rates next month if coming inflation data showed the
moderation it expected. [ID:nCBR000068]
 The currency has strong support around $0.8575-8590, where
there is a 50 percent retracement of its rally this month as well
as a cluster of previous lows.

exports
 * Room for further export growth limited; situation ""grim""
 * Outlook for retail sales brighter
 By Zhou Xin and Ben Blanchard
 BEIJING, July 20 (Reuters) - China sounded a gloomy note on
Tuesday about its export prospects, warning in particular that
belt-tightening by deeply indebted European Union governments
would dampen demand for the country's goods.
 Calling the trade picture ""still complicated and grim"", the
Ministry of Commerce said high growth in exports in the first
half would give way to slow growth in the second half.
 ""The sovereign debt crisis has made many EU countries shift
to fiscal austerity from fiscal expansion, which will greatly
restrict consumption and investment growth in the EU,"" the
ministry's spokesman, Yao Jian, told a news conference.
 Cheap, labour-intensive products would be less vulnerable
to drooping European demand than more expensive, discretionary
goods, he added.
 Spain, Italy, Germany and non-euro member Britain are among
EU countries that are tightening their budgets after Greece had
to be bailed out in April, raising a red flag about the
sustainability of public finances across Europe.
 Furthermore, Brazil, India and other emerging economies
have started to tighten monetary policy, the Commerce Ministry
said.
 ""The room for the further growth of Chinese exports is
limited,"" Yao said.
 As a result, the ministry would keep in place policies
aimed at supporting external demand for Chinese goods,
including retaining export tax rebates.
 Chinese exports grew 43.9 percent in June from a year
earlier, beating forecasts, after 48.5 percent year-on-year
growth in May. However, imports have also boomed, meaning net
exports barely contributed to first-half growth in gross
domestic product, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics.
 Export growth in the second half of this year will slow to
just 16.3 percent, giving full-year growth of about 24.5
percent, the State Information Centre, a leading government
think tank, said in a report published on Monday.
 SLOWING INTO 2011
 Wang Jun, a researcher with the China Center for
International Economic Exchange, a think tank under the
National Development and Reform Commission, agreed that China
could not escape the fallout of the euro zone's debt troubles.
 ""I think growth in China's exports will show a big
slowdown, especially in the fourth quarter. It's very likely
that we'll see single-digit growth by the end of this year,"" he
told a forum.
 A staunch defender of China's exporters, the Ministry of
Commerce has a tendency to stress the difficulties facing the
sector rather than to point out that China has considerably
increased its share of global markets during the economic
crisis.
 But the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
also raised questions about the robustness of China's export
rebound due to the weak foundation of the world recovery.
 ""Although the economy is heading in the right direction,
there are many difficulties and problems,"" Zhu Hongren, a
spokesman for the ministry, told a separate news conference.
 A lot of small export firms were experiencing financing
strains, while wages had gone up by more than a fifth in the
manufacturing strongholds of the Yangtze and Pearl River
Deltas.
 Like exports, factory growth would slow over the rest of
2010 because of a high base of comparison in 2009, the ministry
said.
 But Zhu said the moderation would help China to upgrade its
economy and lay the basis for more sustainable growth.
 ""The slowdown is not only appropriate, but will also help
to facilitate adjustment in China's industrial structure and
economic growth,"" he said.
 TIME TO START EASING?
 Beijing is redoubling its efforts to weed out obsolete,
energy-guzzling plants in a drive to meet ambitious
energy-intensity targets by the end of 2010.
 China has overtaken the United States as the world's
largest energy consumer, according to the International Energy
Agency, an assertion denied on Tuesday by a Chinese official.
 Despite the expected slowdown, full-year factory output
growth may be higher than the 11 percent targeted at the start
of 2010, the Ministry of Industry said.
 The Ministry of Commerce was also optimistic about consumer
spending. Retail sales would keep growing rapidly over the rest
of 2010 thanks to rising incomes and government policies to
encourage consumption, the ministry said.
 Overall, economists expect a further slowdown in economic
growth, which moderated to an annual rate of 10.3 percent last
quarter from 11.9 percent in the first three months of 2010.
 ""With growing signs of economic slowdown, we believe that
the government will now start to discuss possible policy
adjustments,"" Ha Jiming and Xing Ziqiang, economists at China
International Capital Corp, said in a report.
 The government could accelerate the approval of investment
projects, relax curbs on property speculation and loosen its
liquidity controls in addition to keeping interest rates and
banks' required reserves unchanged, they said.

 HONG KONG, July 20 (Reuters) - Asian stocks broadly rose on

 European shares also opened higher after four days of
losses, as investors await earnings from Goldman Sachs

 In Asia, banks <.MIAPJFN00PUS> and resources firms
<.MIAPJMT00PUS> led the rebound, pushing the MSCI index of Asia
Pacific ex-Japan stocks <.MIAPJ0000PUS> up 1.5 percent.
 But the Nikkei average underperformed its regional peers,
dropping as much as 1.7 percent partly due to the strength of
the yen as markets in Japan opened after a three-day weekend.
 The yen  hovered near its a 7-month high against the
dollar, amid growing talk of intervention as traders wondered
if Tokyo could stomach further yen gains.
 In addition to company results, investors are also awaiting

 Investors also faced yet more worrisome data from the

expected in July to its lowest level since April 2009 after a
popular tax credit for homebuyers expired in April.

 JAPAN FRETS OVER YEN
 The dollar was marginally higher against the yen at 87.01
yen , having hit a seven-month low of 86.25 on Friday.
 The euro struck a 2-month high of $1.3022 , having
brushed aside Moody's downgrade of Ireland's credit rating on
Monday and concerns that negotiations between Hungary and
international lenders had broken down. For details, see
[ID:nLDE66I0FY] [ID:nLDE66H021].
 The dollar was bid up by Japanese importers, but was still
within striking distance of a seven-month low versus the yen
leading many market players to look to what authorities in
Japan would do if the yen climbed to the 85 level.
 Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index <.HSI> was up 1.5

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 20 (Reuters) - The dollar eased slightly on
Tuesday, inching closer to a two-month low versus the euro hit
last week as investors continued to cut long positions on more
disappointing U.S. economic data.
 The greenback rose a little against the yen on bids from
Japanese importers, but was still within striking distance of a
seven-month low marked last week, leading many market players to
look to what authorities in Japan could do about a firm yen.
 The market was looking to a press conference by Finance
Minister Yoshihiko Noda for clues on Japanese policymakers' pain
threshold .
 ""I guess the authorities will be nervous. There will be
verbal intervention or they might do rate-checks as they did
before. But I don't think they can do actual intervention,"" said
a trader at a Japanese financial institution.
 In Asian trade, the dollar rose about 0.4 percent to at 87.01
yen, having hit a seven-month low of 86.27 on trading platform
EBS on Friday.
 Traders said Japanese importers, back from a long weekend,
bought the dollar to take advantage of its fall since Friday.
 Traders suspect Japanese officials would not want to see the
85 level breached in a hurry. But low U.S. Treasury yields are
likely to keep the greenback under pressure, as they dent the
allure of investment in the dollar.
 Indeed, traders say they saw marginal yen-selling from
Japanese investors.
 ""Japanese investors' risk appetite hasn't come back. They are
not ready to sell the yen yet. It's hard to expect upside for the
dollar/yen,"" said a trader at a European bank.
 Demand for the dollar waned further on Monday after the
NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell more than expected in
July to its lowest level since April 2009, after a popular tax
credit for homebuyers expired in April.
 The report was the latest in a string of data that has
flashed warnings about the state of the U.S. economy and quashed
expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.
 If the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke drops any hint
of further easing at a testimony on Wednesday, that could push
the dollar further, some traders said.
 ""The overall bearish setup remains intact for dollar/yen,""
JPMorgan said in a morning report. ""This follows last week's
breakdown below the key 87.00/22 yen support zone while affirming
the intermediate term bearish setup and a closer test of the
84.82 November 2009 cycle low.""
 The euro edged up 0.15 percent to $1.2963/64, not far from a
two-month high of $1.3008 hit last Friday.
 Traders expect the pair to trade in a $1.28-1.31 range in
coming days ahead of the EU stress test results, and Fed chief
Ben Bernanke's testimony.
 Support for the euro is seen around the previous day's low of
$1.2870 while resistance comes in at Friday's high of $1.3008.
 The results of stress tests on 91 European banks are due on
Friday and there is a consensus building in the forex market that
it could be positive for the euro.
 Bankers and officials in Greece, Spain and Belgium joined a
chorus of countries expecting their banks to pass European stress
tests, but doubts linger over whether the health checks are tough
or transparent enough.
 But some traders suspect the euro could be in for a
buy-on-rumor-sell-on-fact type of retreat, after having risen
nearly 10 percent from a four-year low hit in early May, mostly
shrugging off negative news on the euro zone.
 It brushed aside news that Moody's cut Ireland's debt rating
and concerns that negotiations between Hungary and international
lenders had broken down. For details, see.
 Meanwhile, the Aussie rose 0.9 percent to $0.8760 and 1.1
percent to 76.22 yen, helped by an upbeat mood in Chinese share
markets and wariness about Japanese yen-selling intervention.
 The Australian dollar quickly recovered the ground it had
lost after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA)
July policy meeting that suggested it was unlikely to raise
interest rates next month if coming inflation data showed the
moderation it expected.
 The currency has a strong support around $0.8575-8590, where
there is a 50 percent retracement of its rally this month as well
as a cluster of previous lows.

 SYDNEY, July 20 (Reuters) - The euro was steady on Tuesday,
hovering within striking distance of two-month highs against the

(Updates to close)
 By Ka Yan Ng
 OTTAWA, July 19 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar was little
changed versus its U.S. counterpart on Monday as investors were
reluctant to take on new risk ahead of Tuesday's Bank of Canada
rate decision and its outlook on the economy.
 The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates
by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, but market players are more
focused on what the bank will say about Canada's economic
prospects, given the uneven global economic recovery.
[CA/POLL]
 ""If there's no verbiage to support further rate hikes don't
look for (the Canadian dollar) to strengthen too much,"" said
John Curran, senior vice-president at CanadianForex, a
commercial foreign exchange firm.
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0549 to the
U.S. dollar, or 94.80 U.S. cents, down from C$1.0546 to the
U.S. dollar, or 94.82 U.S. cents, at Friday's close.
 Earlier it had fallen as low as C$1.0580, or 94.52 U.S.
cents, matching its low point on Friday when it slumped to its
weakest level since July 7. It briefly unwound its losses as it
tracked U.S. equity prices higher, then settled into a slim
range of 25 basis point in the afternoon.
 With the recent softening of some U.S. data, including
Monday's report showing homebuilder confidence in July was
lower than expected, market players will be eager to see how
the Bank of Canada's view of the global economy has changed, if
at all, and how that will affect Canada's prospects.
 Interest rate hikes generally increase demand for a
currency due to the possibility of higher returns, but with the
uncertain growth outlook the statement that comes along with
the rate decision will be key, said Camilla Sutton, currency
strategist at Scotia Capital.
 ""I suspect that the Bank of Canada is going to sound more
dovish than the market thinks right now,"" she said.
 ""I think that they are going to be increasingly concerned
that the Canadian economy has been strong but that, looking
ahead, the risks have increased materially -- that it isn't as
strong as we get into Q3 and Q4.""
 While that may lead to further downside in the currency,
softness in the U.S. dollar will likely limit the weakness,
Sutton said.
 SHORT-DATED BONDS RISE
 Canadian bond prices were mixed, with short-dated issues
gaining as the Toronto Stock Exchange retreated and ahead of
Tuesday's Bank of Canada rate announcement.
 The two-year bond  rose 8 Canadian cents to yield
1.524 percent, while the 10-year bond  fell 10
Canadian cents to yield 3.170 percent.
 Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. Treasury issues across the
curve. The Canadian 10-year bond was 20.4 basis points above
the comparable U.S. bond, versus 23.2 basis points in the
previous session.
 Volumes were also extremely light, and any moves should not
be taken as meaningful signs of overall sentiment, said Sheldon
Dong, a fixed income analyst at TD Waterhouse Private
Investment.
 ""I think you just get a lot of uncertainty, indecision, and
market volatility on a day-to-day basis. There's just no clear
direction at the moment,"" he said, adding that the Bank of
Canada's rate decision was ""pretty much baked in.""
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the Bank of Canada's key policy rate, showed
the market sees just under a 90 percent likelihood of a July 20
rate hike. 
 Earlier on Monday Statistics Canada said that foreigners
nearly doubled their purchases of Canadian securities in May
from April to a record high C$23.16 billion, buying mainly
federal government bonds. [ID:nN19128714]

 * Boeing says loans must be commercial

(adds quotes, detail)
 FARNBOROUGH, England, July 19 (Reuters) - Airbus nations
urged the European Union to appeal against a global trade ruling
condemning loan payments to the planemaker and pledged to
continue discussing financing for the A350 jetliner.
 The ruling from the World Trade Organisation failed to
establish that Europe's system of aircraft loan financing as a
whole was at fault, European officials said.
 Ministers from France, Germany, Britain and Spain -- four
countries that founded Airbus 40 years ago -- discussed the
issue on the sidelines of the Farnborough Airshow.
""It is an unfair situation. All four of us deplore it and
our wish is that the (European) Commission appeals as quickly as
possible,"" French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau said.
 ""France believes the WTO panel confirmed that the principles
of reimbursable advances do not contravene WTO rules,"" he told a
news conference.
 Airbus is in talks with European governments to obtain
further loans for development of its future A350 jetliner, to be
paid back from a royalty on future sales of the plane.
 ""I can say we are encouraged by progress to date,"" Mark
Prisk, junior British minister for business, said of the talks.
 ""Clearly it's a complex set of negotiations and obviously
all of us are committed to acting consistently with our
international obligations, as you would expect.""
 Ministers said France was in discussions to supply 1.4
billion euros, Germany 1.12 billion euros, Spain 332 million
euros and Britain 340 million pounds in A350 development loans.
 Boeing says such loans are unfair and should be withdrawn.
It reiterated calls for future loans to be on a commercial
footing.
 ""The WTO has set a clear legal principle that government
loans to Airbus must be on commercial terms, otherwise they are
an illegal subsidy and inconsistent with WTO rules,"" Boeing
spokesman Charlie Miller said.
 The WTO said last month three European countries had given
prohibited export subsidies as loans for the A380 superjumbo.
 Prisk said the four countries were unhappy about a WTO
decision to delay ruling on an EU counter-case which alleges
that Boeing received illegal aid in research grants.
 The EU has until July 21 to appeal in the original case
brought by the United States and is expected to do so -- a move
that legal experts say would trigger a U.S. counter-appeal.

 By Steven C. Johnson and Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
euro on Monday as data showing U.S. homebuilder sentiment
slumping to a 15-month low stoked fears that the U.S. economic
recovery was running out of steam.
 The euro traded near a recent two-month high against the
dollar, rebounding from earlier lows hit after Moody's cut
Ireland's debt rating while negotiations between Hungary and
international lenders broke down.
 Demand for the dollar fell after the NAHB/Wells Fargo
Housing Market index fell more than expected in July to its
lowest level since April 2009 after a popular tax credit for
homebuyers expired in April.
 The report was the latest in a string of data that has
flashed warnings about the state of the U.S. economy and
quashed expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike
this year.
 ""The euro is simply trading on U.S. weakness,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, New
Jersey. ""We've had two or three weeks of increasingly poor U.S.
statistics and that's really the issue now.""
 Analysts say markets are particularly sensitive to housing
data as the sector's deterioration was a major reason for the
U.S. economy's descent into recession and will be a crucial
component of a lasting recovery.
 The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.2844 after earlier
hitting a session low of $1.2872. Traders said a large buy
order from the Middle East, executed through a major U.S. bank
in London had lifted the euro to a session high of $1.2991.
 The euro rose 0.5 percent to 112.22 yen and also rose
against sterling while the dollar added 0.1 percent to 86.69
yen, bouncing back from Friday's seven-month low.
 BANKS AWAIT THEIR GRADES
 Investors also awaited the results of stress tests on 91
European banks due on Friday.
 Bankers and officials in Greece, Spain and Belgium joined a
chorus of countries expecting their banks to pass European
stress tests, but doubts linger over whether the health checks
are tough or transparent enough.
 ""We expect the stress test to be well received, but its
main effect on the euro will be to reduce the probability of a
large downside move,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.
 Some analysts said a recent rebound in the euro, which hit
a two-month high of $1.3008 on electronic trading platform EBS
on Friday, may have been overdone.
 ""The euro's recent strength has been exaggerated by
positions, as people scale back from extremely short
positions,"" Subbarao said.
 The latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed speculators positions have been increasing
long in the yen while cutting longs in the dollar, especially
against the euro and pound.
 Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in New York,
said the euro's break above the 100-day simple moving average
around $1.29 last week bolstered demand for the currency.
 Technical analysts saw near-term support at around $1.2850,
the 50 percent retracement of the euro's fall from a high near
$1.3820 in March to a four-year low of $1.1876 in early June.

 * Trade with China to double by 2015
 
 By Marja Novak
 LJUBLJANA, July 19 (Reuters) - Canada expects trade with
European Union to rise by some 20 percent in the five years
after a trade deal between Canada and the EU is enforced,
Canada's trade minister said on Monday.
 Canada is negotiating the free trade deal with the EU, which
should ease trade and create new business opportunities. The
deal is expected to be finalised in 2011, Peter Van Loan said
during a visit to Slovenia as part of a European tour.
 He told Reuters trade growth should be particularly high
with new EU members, where there has so far been little
bilateral business.
 ""I want to highlight ... that there is indeed a part of
Europe where there has been high economic growth over the past
10 to 15 years and ... that there are opportunities here,"" Van
Loan said.
 ""A study projected a 20 percent increase in trade ... simply
as a consequence of the agreement.""
 He said he expected countries that joined the EU since 2004
would grow quickly despite a slowdown caused by the global
financial and economic crisis.
 But said the possibility of a global double-dip recession
remained ""a great concern"", noting governments had already taken
action to avoid it by reforming banking, resisting
protectionism, carrying on fiscal stimulus and managing
sovereign debt.
 ""But we have to continue to stay focused, there has to be
more than just promises made, governments have to carry through
on those commitments,"" Van Loan added.
 European Union is Canada's second biggest trading partner,
accounting for some 15 percent of Canada's overall trade. Total
trade between the two partners reached about 50 billion euros in
2008.
 Van Loan said that Canada, which wants to diversify its
foreign trade, also ""quite realistically"" expected that its
trade with China would double to some $60 billion by 2015, and
the trade balance should also improve by then.
 China is Canada's third largest trading partner but Canada
imports four times more from China than it exports there.
 Despite of the planned trade diversification, the United
States will remain Canada's main trading partner, although the
percentage of exports to the United States will decline from
some 70 percent of Canada's total exports at present, Van Loan
said.

 * Detailed analysis shows limited impact
 * Fears of 1930s re-run unrealised
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, July 19 (Reuters) - Protectionist measures taken by
different countries during the financial crisis had little
overall impact on trade, a World Bank economist said on Monday.
 Hiau Looi Kee said research she and her colleagues have
undertaken shows that protectionist measures such as tariff
increases or anti-dumping duties accounted for less than two
percent of the contraction in world trade in the crisis.
 The economic downturn resulting from the financial crisis
that broke in 2008 prompted fears that countries would defend
themselves with protectionism, leading to a rerun of the 1930s
Great Depression when governments reacted to the 1929 Wall
Street Crash with a series of beggar-thy-neighbour trade moves.
 And while G20 leaders immediately promised to keep markets
open, in practice many did implement protectionist policies.
 Such measures have been documented by Global Trade Alert
(GTA) (www.globaltradealert.org), a project by independent
economists, whose latest report last month showed protectionist
policies were continuing to mount.
 But Kee said that analysis of the same data used by GTA gave
a different picture, when examined for its impact on trade
flows, the share of affected goods in overall trade, and the
responsiveness of trade in those products to the measures.
 ""It's quite sensational to read about all the countries
raising tariffs and anti-dumping duties, but if you actually do
the math it doesn't look like a great deal of effect,"" she told
Reuters by telephone from Washington.
 
 DECLINING PROTECTIONIST PRESSURE
 Kee said that at the very most, protectionist policies had
resulted in a decline of $43 billion in trade between July 2008
and September 2009, the latest period for which detailed tariff
data are available.
 The World Trade Organization estimates that trade contracted
by 23 percent in value terms in 2009 to $12.5 trillion.
 She said the research had looked only at quantifiable
protectionist measures such as tariff increases or duties, not
at ""murky protectionism"" such as stimulus packages or Buy
National policies whose economic effect was hard to assess.
 Many economists have argued that the reason for the biggest
contraction in trade since World War Two was the collapse in
demand prompted by the crisis, with its accompanying loss of
business and consumer confidence.
 Rich economies like the United States and European Union had
little scope to raise tariffs under WTO rules, and most of their
measures took the form of anti-dumping duties -- taxes imposed
on imports sold allegedly for less than they cost to produce and
a frequent source of trade disputes.
 Developing countries on the other hand were able to use both
anti-dumping and tariff increases.
 ""Given that trade is recovering well, the urgency to use
protectionist policy is less than one year ago so I do not
foresee trade policy will have a lot of action ... from now on,""
Kee said.
 But she said stubbornly high unemployment in rich countries
could lead governments to adopt some protectionist policies.
 Kee's analysis is in line with that of the WTO, which has
concluded that the global trading system has withstood the
crisis and protectionist pressures well.

 ""2011-2012 is the time when the rising tide will lift all
ships,"" Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Gary Scott told
reporters.
 Hazy, the mastermind of the aircraft leasing industry who
recently started afresh after leaving AIG, ordered 51
narrow-body Airbus planes and said he would buy more planes
soon.
 ""We have a lot of old and loyal airline customers,"" he said.
""Lessors are capturing a larger and larger segment of the total
population of airliners.""
 The leasing arm of GE weighed in with an order for 100
similar planes -- 60 from Airbus and 40 from Boeing -- worth a
total $8 billion, and delegates said Hazy could lift the
combined tally to 200 planes.
 Leasing firms, which buy aircraft to be lent out to
airlines, are the first to flee the market when traffic and
business decline and first to come back when activity improves.
 ""Right now you are looking at a very strong return for those
leasing companies. There is a strong demand for these products
and they seem to be taking advantage,"" said Richard Aboulafia,
Vice President at Virginia-based consultancy Teal Group.
 
 MIDDLE EASTERN FOCUS
 There was also plenty of focus on Middle Eastern buyers at
the show, given their propensity for large orders.
 Dubai's Emirates placed a $9 billion order for 30 Boeing 777
large passenger jets, just six weeks after making an $11 billion
order for superjumbo Airbus A380s.
 On the other hand, Qatar's national carrier Qatar Airways,
expected to make a splash at the show, only bought a couple of
Bombardier executive jets.
 Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker told reporters
he was prepared to order Bombardier's new single-aisle C-series
passenger jets but ""some issues"" had come up during talks.
 Bombardier later told Reuters the issues were between Qatar
Airways and Pratt & Whitney, the United Technologies Corp unit
that makes engines for the C-series.
 
 CLOSED-DOOR DEALING
 The wheeling and dealing was typical for Farnborough,
otherwise a sleepy southern English town that hosts a massive
aviation and arms jamboree every other year, rotating with Le
Bourget near Paris.
 Much of the real business done or prepared at the show is in
invitation-only chalets of defence companies, even though
several have reduced their presence to display belt-tightening,
and arms makers are bracing for heavy Western defence cuts.
 U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency Director Jeffrey
Wieringa told Reuters a deal was near on the sale of fighter
jets to Israel, specifically the first foreign military sale of
the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter outside of the
eight partner nations. 
 ""The ball is in their court,"" Wieringa said. ""I am waiting
for them to make a decision any day.""

130,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2010 12:40PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Obama: Republicans playing politics with jobless," * Obama seeking to redirect Americans' frustration
 * ""It's time to do what's right,"" he says
 * Republicans seek to avoid adding to deficit
(Adds Gibbs, Hatch comments)
 By Steve Holland
 WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
accused his Republican opponents on Monday of playing
election-year politics by refusing to join with Democrats in
approving an extension of U.S. jobless benefits.
 Obama, under pressure to reduce the 9.5 percent U.S.
jobless rate, sought to direct some of Americans' frustration
over the sputtering economy toward the Republicans, who are
hoping for big gains in Nov. 2 congressional elections.
 In Rose Garden remarks, Obama said Republicans have opposed
a $34 billion extension of benefits for the unemployed in this
instance but had voted for such extensions when Republican
President George W. Bush had asked for them.
 Republicans say they would support the benefits but want
them to be paid for with spending cuts instead of simply using
borrowed money that adds to the ballooning U.S. national debt.
 ""It's time to stop holding workers laid off in this
recession hostage to Washington politics. It's time to do
what's right, not for the next election, but for the middle
class,"" Obama said with three unemployed workers joining him on
the steps of the Rose Garden.
 ""There are times when you put elections aside,"" he added.
""This is one of those times.""
 The Senate is expected to pass the benefits extension on
Tuesday or Wednesday.
 Democrats hold a 58-41 advantage over Republicans in the
chamber, but need 60 votes to overcome parliamentary blocking
maneuvers. Their 59th vote will come on Tuesday when West
Virginia Democrat Carte Goodwin is sworn in to fill the vacancy
left by the death of Democratic Senator Robert Byrd.
 Democrats are expected to get favorable votes from two
Maine Republicans, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, while
losing Nebraska Democratic Senator Ben Nelson.
 A swearing-in ceremony for Goodwin is set for 2:15
p.m./1815 GMT on Tuesday, with a procedural vote on the
unemployment benefits 15 minutes later. Final passage is likely
later in the day, a Democratic aide said.
 The House of Representatives is expected to approve the
measure later in the week and send it to Obama to sign into
law.
 Senate Republicans have argued that the $34 billion cost of
extending benefits through November could be covered by cutting
other programs.
 HARD TIMES
 ""If we can't pay for a program like extension of
unemployment insurance that ... every member of the Senate
wants to extend, then what are we going to pay for?"" Senate
Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on CNN on Sunday.
 White House spokesman Robert Gibbs defended the use of
borrowed money to pay for the benefits, saying it is justified
in an economic emergency.
 ""If you came home and you had a leak in your roof, but you
didn't have the money to pay for it, and the only think you
could do was borrow the money, would you argue at the kitchen
table that everybody ought to just get wet until we can scrape
together the money to pay for it?"" he said.
 Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said that Obama, instead of
acknowledging his economic policies have not lived up to his
administration's promises, had ""blamed everyone but his own
White House for the economic morass we're in.""
 ""That's not the kind of leadership we need,"" Hatch said.
 All 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 36 Senate
seats are up for grabs in November, and most political experts
believe it is possible Republicans could win the House and
challenge Democratic control of the Senate.
 A poll conducted for Third Way, a moderate think tank,
suggested that Republicans have been successful at shedding the
economic image of deficit spending left over from the Bush
years.
 It said two-thirds of Americans now see congressional
Republicans and their economic ideas as new and completely
separate from those of the former president.
 ""If in November, voters continue to believe that Republican
ideas are new and different from President Bush, the poll shows
they could win control of Congress. But the poll also showed a
glimmer of light for Democrats, indicating that if they can tie
their opponents to Bush's economic ideas, they can win,"" Third
Way said.

 * Ireland downgrade, collapse of Hungary talks dent euro
 * Euro zone bank stress tests results due Friday
(Adds quotes, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
dollar on Monday after a fall in U.S. home-builder sentiment to
its lowest level in more than a year added to worries about the
U.S. economy.
 The euro traded near its recent two-month high against the
dollar, rebounding from early lows hit after a downgrade of
Ireland's sovereign ratings and the suspension of talks between
Hungary and international lenders.
 Demand for the dollar fell after the NAHB/Wells Fargo
Housing Market index fell more than expected in July to its
lowest level since April 2009 after a popular home-buyer tax
credit expired in April. See
 The dollar has been under pressure in recent weeks as
disappointing U.S. economic news quashed expectations of an
interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
 ""The euro is now simply trading on U.S. economic weakness,""
said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in
Saddle River, New Jersey. ""We have had two or three weeks of
increasingly poor U.S. statistics and that's really the issue
now.""
 The housing market, which played a large role in the U.S.
economy's fall into recession, is considered key to recovery.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was up 0.2 percent
versus the dollar at $1.2956, steadying off a session low of
$1.2872, according to Reuters data.
 Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in
New York, said the break last week above the 100-day simple
moving average in the euro/dollar around $1.29 added to support
for the euro.
 Traders said a large buy order from the Middle East,
executed through a major U.S. bank in London had lifted
euro/dollar to a session high of $1.2991.
 Technical analysts saw near-term support at around $1.2850,
the 50 percent retracement of the euro's fall from a high near
$1.3820 in March to a four-year low around $1.1876 in early
June.
 STRESS TESTS
 Investors also awaited the results of stress tests on 91
European banks due on Friday.
 Bankers and officials in Greece, Spain and Belgium joined a
chorus of countries expecting their banks to pass European
stress tests, but doubts linger over whether the health checks
are tough or transparent enough.
 ""We expect the stress test to be well received, but its
main effect on the euro will be to reduce the probability of a
large downside move,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist
at Barclays Capital.
 Some analysts said a recent rebound in the euro, which hit
a two-month high of $1.3008 on electronic trading platform EBS
on Friday, may have been overdone.
 ""The euro's recent strength has been exaggerated by
positions, as people scale back from extremely short
positions,"" Subbarao said.
 The latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed speculators have been increasing long
positions in the yen and cutting longs in the dollar,
especially against the euro and pound.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.4 percent at 112.36.
Traders said the cross yen pair was attempting to climb back
into its daily Ichimoku cloud for the third straight day, but
was so far capped by Japanese offers placed ahead of the cloud
base at 113.14 yen.
 It has not managed to close within the cloud since early
May. The cloud top is some way off, coming in at 117.97 yen.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent versus the yen at 86.71 yen,
bouncing back from a seven-month low of 86.27 yen hit on Friday
on EBS.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2010 11:52AM ET</span>",Iran oil buyers in Europe lukewarm on dirham switch,"* Iran asked buyers to switch to dirham-trade source
 * Switch ""not easy,"" may entail additional costs
 
 By Alex Lawler
 LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - European buyers of Iranian crude
gave a lukewarm reaction on Monday to an Iranian proposal to
seek payment in UAE dirhams rather than euros, with company
sources citing extra costs and complexity.
 An Iranian official said on Sunday that Iran may seek
payment for its oil exports to Europe in dirhams because tougher
EU sanctions could block Iranian transactions in the single
European currency.
 A trading source with a European buyer of Iranian crude said
that Tehran had asked buyers earlier this month to make the
switch, but for now, payment was still being made in euros.
 ""They asked everybody. For the moment we are still paying in
euros, but it is something that is not easy and we are studying
the situation,"" said the source, who declined to be identified.
 The dollar is the standard currency for oil trade, but Iran
shifted to the euro for European deals in response to many years
of U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
 A source with another European company which has bought
Iranian crude this year said the firm was looking into the
consequences of any switch to the dirham, but its initial
reaction was not favourable.
 ""We are evaluating it,"" said the source. ""It is too
difficult for us and would cost a lot.""

 TOUGHER SANCTIONS
 Last month, Europe also toughened its sanctions against Iran
in a stepped-up international effort to make Tehran suspend a
nuclear programme which the West suspects is secretly designed
to develop atomic bombs. 
 Iran says it seeks only civilian energy from its uranium
enrichment process. 
 Oil transactions can in theory be carried out in whichever
currency the parties involved agree upon. A source with a third
European oil company said Iran was willing to absorb any cost of
currency conversion.
 Other buyers were not sure who would be liable for any
additional costs, but made clear they would expect Iran to pay
them.
 ""There would maybe not be huge amounts but there would be
something,"" a source with the first European customer said.
""We'd transfer the cost to them, into the price of their crude.
But that's hard work.""
 In contrast, an official at a major oil company, for which
currency hedging is ""nothing unusual,"" was more relaxed about
the prospect of paying in dirhams. 
 ""We are indifferent as to which currency things need to be
done in. Technically, it doesn't affect anything so long as it's
not pricing,"" the source said.

 By Manuela Badawy and Ian Chua
 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near
a two-month high while U.S. stocks moved sideways on Monday as
worries about the pace of a U.S. economic recovery kept markets
cautious.
 After Friday's worst one-day drop since late June, the S&P
and other U.S. stock indexes opened higher as earnings season
kicked into high gear, but weak homebuilding data reminded
investors of the delicate state of the economic recovery.
 The early rise in stocks pushed oil prices up 1 percent and
pressured gold to a two-month low amid a sharper appetite for
riskier assets.
 But markets lost ground after data showed homebuilder
sentiment fell more than expected in July to its lowest level
in more than a year after a popular homebuyer tax credit
expired.
 ""Seeing these numbers go down fits the notion that housing
will be a drag into the third quarter,"" said Jonathan Basile,
economist at Credit Suisse in New York.

 The euro  was up 0.40 percent at $1.2982, hovering
near a two-month high against the dollar and rebounding from

(Adds comments from the finance ministry and analysts)
TALLINN, July 19 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Fitch upgraded
Estonia's credit rating to A from BBB+ on Monday ahead of the
Baltic state's entry to the euro zone at the start of next year.
 It followed Standard & Poor's, which raised its rating on
Estonia to 'A' with a stable outlook in June.
 Though hit by one of the worst recessions in the European
Union last year, Estonia managed to meet the euro entry fiscal
deficit and inflation targets. EU finance ministers this month
gave it the final green light to adopt the euro in January.
 Fitch said the ratings on Estonia had a stable outlook.
 ""Joining the euro area improves Estonia's risk profile as it
reduces risks associated with the country's sizeable external
debt and foreign exchange lending in the domestic banking
system, and gives its banks access to European Central Bank
liquidity facilities,"" said Douglas Renwick, associate director
in Fitch's sovereigns group.
 ""Furthermore, Estonia's sound public finances and flexible
economy make the country well-suited for a currency union.""
 The Finance Ministry welcomed the upgrade.
 ""Euro area membership will also support further recovery and
the resumption of growth against the backdrop of a very strong
fiscal stance and flexible economic structures,"" Tanel Ross, a
senior finance ministry official, said in an email to Reuters.
 Helsinki-based macro analyst with Nordea bank, Annika
Lindblad, said the Fitch move would lower the cost of debt
servicing and help attract foreign investment to the country,
which will be the poorest member of the euro zone.
 ""The credit rating upgrade further strengthens our view of
increasing foreign investment into the Estonian economy over the
next couple of years""
 Estonia will become the 17th member of the euro zone from
Jan 1, 2011 after adopting a strict fiscal policy and drastic
budget savings while the economy shrank 14.1 percent in 2009.
 The government does not issue any treasury bills and has no
bonds which gives it the EU's lowest general public sector debt
at 7.2 percent of GDP. Moody's ratings agency rates Estonia 'A1'
with a stable outlook.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2010 09:16AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Hungary now Europe's austerity test case after IMF row," * EU wants to keep up pressure for continent-wide cuts
 * Troubled euro zone borrowers Greece, Spain in focus
 * Little compromise seen ahead of Hungary local elections
 * Romania, Latvia IMF deals also vulnerable to politics
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - The collapse of Hungary's deal
with international lenders marks the greatest challenge by a
government so far to the Europe-wide orthodoxy of austerity,
with markets and other nations watching closely.
 Talks between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
European Union and Hungary's recently elected centre-right
Fidesz government fell through over the weekend over deficit
targets, hitting the currency and raising bond yields.
 Analysts say governments in the EU's core, particularly
Germany, are in no mood to be flexible on deficit reduction and
want to send a strong signal beyond emerging Europe to troubled
euro zone fringe states including Spain and Greece.
 ""The real driver here is the EU,"" said Preston Keat, head of
research for political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. ""They are
the ones who are pushing so hard for austerity -- more so than
the IMF. They are trying to signal to other EU countries that
this is a new era regarding budgets and public finances.""
 German voters in particular loath the idea of bailing out
more profligate euro zone nations, with support for Greece being
partly blamed for Chancellor Angela Merkel's defeat in local
elections this year. That is seen driving broader EU policy. 
 Emerging European nations began trying to balance their
budgets much earlier in the crisis to qualify for essential IMF
and EU support, with populations generally broadly accepting of
the measures and unrest and dissent so far generally limited.
 Poland has proved particularly reluctant to cut spending,
but as one of Europe's better placed economies this has prompted
much less concern. Hungary, in contrast, is central Europe's
most indebted economy with public debt at around 80 percent of
GDP.
 In Western Europe, opposition to the cuts has so far been
highly fragmented, mainly limited to groups lobbying against the
axe falling on them. Investors would likely worry if any
government looks to be wobbling on austerity.
 Fidesz had said before its election that it would aim to
renegotiate deficit targets with the IMF and also wants to
impose tough tax rises on banks, worrying large European banks
with a presence in the country. 
 
 MARKET REACTION KEY
 Most analysts had assumed an agreement would be struck, but
many now believe there will be little movement until the IMF
returns in September or local elections on October 3 -- unless
dramatic market pressure forces action faster.
 Analysts say that in many ways the situation in Hungary is
something of a one-off. Investors were already concerned over
confused signals from the new government, particularly after
officials overtly compared its situation to that of Greece.
 But some worry they might see similar problems in Romania if
the fragile government collapses, as well as potentially in
Latvia if the opposition Harmony win elections scheduled for
October 2. Harmony has opposed Latvia's IMF/EU package as too
harsh, although it helped the government win a parliamentary
vote on the measures in January by abstaining.
 Whether markets choose to punish Hungary badly may be key to
what happens next. The forint lost over 2.5 percent against the
euro and bond yields rose by 25-30 basis points on Monday,
boosting borrowing costs. Analysts say it is too soon to say how
serious or prolonged the market reaction will be.
 ""The key is the market reaction -- if Hungary is seen as
having got away with it that will have much wider implications"",
said Nomura emerging markets economist Peter Attard Montalto. 
 ""It's hard to tell today because we're still seeing hot
money moving out -- people who had bet on successful IMF talks
-- but we should have more of an idea by the end of the week.""
 Hungary would not face financing pressure itself until the
fourth quarter, he said, but its banks could come under pressure
earlier. A currency slump would boost import costs and hurt
local borrowers with debts in foreign currency.
 
 HUNGARY, EU PLAYING POLITICS
 Markets have so far been dogged in their pressure on
countries investors worry might be remiss in rebalancing public
finances, but might also become nervous that cutting spending
too fast might further imperil growth and also tax revenues.
 The knock-on market reaction on the rest of the region so
far seemed limited, Montalto said, but the Hungary dispute had
much broader potential regional impact than the prolonged
troubles over Ukraine's IMF deal.
 That collapsed because pre-election politics made it
impossible to pass a budget, but policymakers continued to
engage with the IMF and it was seen as a more unique situation. 
 The new government bowed to IMF pressure and negotiated a
new $14.9 billion loan pushing through painful measures
including gas price rises.
 For Hungary, keeping communications channels open between
the government and EU/IMF negotiators will be key -- although
possibly far from easy if politics get in the way.
 ""This may be good politics and political signalling both
from the Fidesz government -- 'we will not cave in to the IMF,
and we will punish the evil banks' -- and the EU -- 'after the
Greece debacle, fiscal austerity and transparency are
non-negotiable',"" said Eurasia Group's Keat. ""This may not
translate into good economic policies or market reactions.""

 * Robust foreign demand for Swiss goods offers some succour
 * Weaker franc vs dollar also offers benefit to some
 
 By Catherine Bosley and Rupert Pretterklieber
 ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc's strength
against the euro could wipe out 10 percent of operating profit
this year at some Swiss firms with big business in the euro
zone, Switzerland's top trading partner.
 An 11-percent rally in the Swiss franc against the euro in
the first six months of the year has prompted Swiss industry
body Swissmem to warn that the franc's strength could dent
foreign demand for Swiss goods.
 Companies such as Swatch Group which have a large sales base
in the euro zone and report in francs rather than euros are
likely to be hit hardest.
 Brokerage Kepler Capital Markets cut its earnings per share
estimates for Swiss companies by an average of 3 percent
annually for the period 2010 to 2012 on the assumption the Swiss
franc remains at about 1.34 per euro.
 ""The second-quarter results will likely be very strong.
(But) the strong franc versus the euro will surely have an
impact, particularly via the currency translation effect,"" said
Credit Suisse analyst Reto Hess.
 ""For the third quarter there may be more of a currency
effect since the export momentum probably won't be as strong and
the longer it lasts it will add to pressure to margins or on
prices,"" Hess said.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Earnings for Kuehne & Nagel will be cut 3 percent this year
if the franc stays at current levels against the euro, the
logistics group's CFO told Reuters on Monday.
Swiss chocolate producer Lindt & Spruengli and KitKat maker
Nestle are likely to take a 3 percent hit to their earnings per
share, according to Kepler.
 A Credit Suisse study of small and medium-sized businesses
found more than half believed exports to the euro zone would
fall due to the exchange rate, with the chemicals and pharma,
precision-industry, metals industry, and consumer goods seen
taking the biggest hits.
 Operating profit could come under pressure for companies
with costs in francs but turnover in euros, said ZKB analyst
Sven Bucher. ""If the exchange rate stays like this, it could
have a negative effect of 10 percent or more,"" he said.
 
 HOPE FOR SOME
 But some Swiss companies stand to benefit from the franc's
4-percent fall against the dollar in the first half of the year,
with groups like reinsurer Swiss Re and drugmaker Roche poised
to gain, according to Sarasin.
 The franc's status as a safe-haven is also luring more
investors as they flee the uncertainty caused by the euro zone
troubles, with banks such as Sarasin already seeing more inflows
from Germany, Italy or Spain.
 The weak euro is turning out to be a boon for exports from
the euro zone and has brought on a revival within the auto
industry. This is expected to help Swiss companies that deliver
parts.
 ""Capital goods makers are benefitting from strong exports to
Germany. They deliver parts for them. That effect could be
stronger than the currency effect,"" Hess said.
 Car-part supplier Georg Fischer surprised with a
stronger-than-expected first-half net profit on Monday, while
the upturn is also expected to boost rival Rieter.
 
 SWISSNESS SELLS
 So far Swiss exports have proven remarkably resilient to the
franc's rise as many customers are still willing to pay for the
quality associated with Swiss products.
 Swiss exports surged by a real 7 percent year-on-year in
May, following rises in March and April. ""Exports are more
responsive to changes in demand than to changes in the exchange
rate,"" said Cornelia Luchsinger, an
economist with ZKB.
 ""For Swiss exporters, precision equipment and medical
technology are key segments. These are high quality products
where one doesn't have to compete on price,"" she said.
 Swiss watchmakers are profiting from roaring demand from
Hong Kong as its currency is still pegged to the dollar.
 ""The fact that the dollar is relatively stronger versus the
franc is an advantage to companies exporting to that currency
area,"" UBS said.

 (Adds background, analyst)
 BUDAPEST, July 19 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank kept
interest rates  on hold as expected at a record low of
5.25 percent  on Monday, despite market falls after
talks broke down between the government and lenders.
 The bank's regular rate-setting meeting on Monday followed a
suspension of a regular review of Hungary's financing programme
by the International Monetary Fund and the EU on Saturday.
 Hungary's markets sold off on Monday after talks with
lenders fell through, rattling investor confidence in the
government's policies and raising concerns over the country's
debt vulnerability.[ID:nLDE66I0BE]
 The central bank's decision was in line with expectations of
all 25 analysts in a Reuters poll last week .
 Some analysts said on Monday that if a weakening of the
forint  continues and the currency eases past levels
of 300 to the euro, the bank might opt to hike rates.
 At 1215 GMT, the forint  traded at 289 versus the
euro, a touch weaker than 288.35 shortly before the interest
rate decision.
 The bank had reduced its key rate between July 2009 and
April 2010 by a combined 425 basis points, but left them on hold
in May and June citing risks to inflation and market risks.
 Central bank Governor Andras Simor will hold a news
conference at 1300 GMT.
 Analysts said the bank's decision to hold rates was
appropriate.
""In this situation, the central bank must calm markets, and
that is what they are presumably going to do today,"" said Matyas
Kovacs at Raiffeisen, referring to the pending press conference.
""We await the press conference but look for (Governor) Simor
to drive home the seriousness of what's happened and also talk
more about the impact of banking tax and the threats to NBH
independence,"" added Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.

 (Adds Bundesbank, Economy Ministry reports)
 By Sarah Marsh and Paul Carrel
 BERLIN, July 19 (Reuters) - Germany said on Monday its
economic recovery should strengthen in the second half of the
year, and its central bank called on troubled euro-zone states
to adjust their economies rather than look to others to change.
 The finance and economy ministries both expected the economy
to have grown significantly more in the second quarter than the
first, when it expanded by 0.2 percent, as industry profited
from foreign demand and a recovery in domestic investment.
 ""Given the upwards trend in industrial demand and the
optimistic mood among companies, the economic recovery should
strengthen in the second half of the year,"" the Finance Ministry
said in its monthly report.
 The ministry's upbeat view of the economic outlook
contrasted with the message from forward-looking economic
indicators, which have pointed to a slowdown in growth later
this year after a strong second quarter.
 German analyst and investor sentiment fell in July to its
lowest since April 2009 on concerns of weaker growth this year,
the ZEW economic think tank's monthly poll showed last week.
 The Economy Ministry said risks to the recovery remained.
 ""The global economic recovery is not yet self-sustaining in
some leading industrial countries; in some emerging countries
there are on the other hand already signs of overheating. The
euro debt crisis also remains a source of uncertainty,"" it said.
 In a separate monthly report, the Bundesbank said economic
imbalances in peripheral euro-zone countries posed risks to the
bloc as a whole and the onus was on those states to adjust their
economies rather than look to others to change.
 These imbalances, which were reflected in current account
deficits, were a source of vulnerability not only for the
""deficit"" states concerned.
 ""Given the transmission effects via the interconnected
financial markets of the currency union, they constitute a
source of danger for other member countries and thereby for the
whole currency union,"" the Bundesbank wrote.
 ""They also burden the implementation of a
stability-orientated uniform monetary policy,"" it added.
 Germany, which runs a current account surplus and relies
heavily on exports to drive growth, has come under pressure from
some other countries -- including France -- to boost domestic
demand to help address the economic imbalances in the euro zone.
 The Bundesbank said the onus was on deficit countries to
make corrections.
 ""Compensation measures from euro zone countries with current
account surpluses by means of stimulating their domestic demand,
for example with an expansive wage and fiscal policy, would be
neither appropriate for the problem nor would they provide much
relief given the minor transmission effect to deficit states,""
the central bank said.
 German trade with the rest of the world surged in May.
 ""The outlook for a further rise in exports is good,"" the
Finance Ministry said, adding that a recent rise in imports and
domestic orders also pointed to recovering domestic demand.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded on Monday
from early lows hit after Ireland's ratings downgrade and the
suspension of talks between Hungary and international lenders,
but traders remained wary ahead of bank stress test results.
 Traders said semi-official demand was helping to push the
rate back above $1.2900, while a large buy order from the Middle
East, executed through a major U.S. bank in London, had helped
euro/dollar to a session high of $1.2991.
 By 1048 GMT, the euro was trading up 0.2 percent versus the
dollar at $1.2965, steadying off a session low of $1.2872.
 But analysts said a recent rebound in the euro, which hit a
two-month high of $1.3008 on Friday, may have been overdone.
 ""The euro's recent strength has been exaggerated by
positions, as people scale back from extremely short (euro)
positions,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at
Barclays Capital.
 ""As people square positions, we don't see much further
upside from here.""
 Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators have been increasing long positions in the
yen and cutting longs in the dollar, especially against the euro
and pound..
 Moody's Investors Service downgraded Ireland's sovereign
bond rating to Aa2 with a stable outlook from Aa1.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The International Monetary Fund and the European Union
suspended on Saturday a review of Hungary's funding programme,
putting some pressure on the single currency.
 ""The impact of the Ireland downgrade was muted as Moody's
kept a stable outlook. But we expect euro/dollar to remain
capped and think the stress tests will provide the last chance
to sell the euro again,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency
strategist at UBS.
 
 STRESS TESTS
 Traders highlighted option expiries in the euro at $1.2970
and $1.3000, potentially hampering the currency until they
rolled off at 1400 GMT.
 Technical analysts saw near-term support at around $1.2850,
the 50 percent retracement of the euro's fall from a high near
$1.3820 on March 17 to a four-year low of $1.1876 in early June.
 Market players awaited the results of stress tests on 91
European banks due on Friday.
 ""We expect the stress test to be well received but its main
effect on the euro will be to reduce the probability of a large
downside move,"" Barclay's Subbarao said. 
 ""Any initial move higher should be limited and we feel
euro/dollar will move lower over time.""
 Greece's central bank chief said he expected the country's
lenders to smoothly pass European Union stress tests.

 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.8 percent at 112.84 yen.
Traders said the cross yen pair was attempting to climb back
into its daily Ichimoku cloud for the third straight day, but
was so far capped by Japanese offers placed ahead of the cloud
base at 113.14 yen, traders said.
 It has not managed to close within the cloud since early
May. The cloud top is some way off, coming in at 117.97 yen.
 The dollar was up 0.5 percent versus the yen at 87.03 yen,
bouncing back from a seven-month low of 86.27 yen hit on Friday
on EBS.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2010 06:40AM ET</span>",Q+A-How do the new anti-Iran sanctions affect oil?," By Barbara Lewis
 DUBAI, July 26 (Reuters) - Decades of sanctions against Iran
have stunted its economic development and the growth of its
all-important oil sector.
 The international community, led by the United States, has
made sanctions more and more stringent as Iran has refused to
abandon its nuclear programme.
 Iran says it is seeking only to provide enough energy for
civilian use, but the international community suspects it of
trying to develop atomic weapons.
 
 HOW DO THE NEW SANCTIONS DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS ROUNDS?
 In the latest wave of sanctions, Europe was on Monday
expected to approve its first measures specifically targeting
the strategic oil and gas industry, starving it of technical
assistance and investment.
 The U.S. has also toughened its sanctions against Iran's oil
and gas sector and is now restricting not just its own
companies, but also the U.S. operations of international firms
that supply fuel to Iran.
 The U.S. and EU sanctions go further than a fourth round of
United Nations sanctions in June, which imposed measures against
new Iranian banks abroad if a connection to the nuclear or
missiles programme is suspected, as well as vigilance over
transactions with any Iranian bank, including the central bank.
 
 ARE THE LATEST EU/US SANCTIONS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE IMPACT ON
THE OIL/GAS INDUSTRY THAN PREVIOUS MEASURES?
 Hossein Askari, Iran Professor of International Business and
International Affairs at the George Washington University,
Washington DC, cited three reasons:
 1. It's relative. ""The latest U.N. sanctions were not really
that biting.""
 2. The new sanctions follow punitive action that underlines
the risks companies run if they breach them.
 Credit Suisse agreed to pay a more than $500 million fine
after it violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.
 3. Ships will be inspected. ""You're going to be much more
cautious in doing anything with Iran,"" said Askari.
 
 HOW DO THE SANCTIONS AFFECT ENERGY SUPPLIES TO IRAN?
 Lawyers say the new sanctions are a matter of
interpretation. Under strict readings, Iranian aircraft were
denied refuelling in Hamburg, Germany, and BPL confirmed it had
ended its contract with Iran Air at Hamburg airport.
 BP did not give a reason and declined to comment on whether
BP had ended all contracts with the Iranian flag carrier.
 Analysts have said BP would be particularly keen to avoid
any further conflict with the United States following its huge
oil spill in the U.S. Gulf.
 WHO WILL SUPPLY FUEL AND TECHNOLOGY?
 Although the fifth-largest exporter of oil, Iran does not
have enough refining capacity to meet domestic demand and has to
import up to 40 percent of its gasoline needs.
 Powers friendly towards Iran, such as China, could continue
to sell fuel to it. Fuel is also smuggled into Iran.
 Russia earlier this month drew up plans for lasting
cooperation on energy and said sanctions would not stand in the
way. However, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev also urged Iran
to explain the ""military components"" of its nuclear programme.
 Iran's oil minister Massoud Mirkazemi told Iran's IRIBnews
website in Moscow: ""The sanctions will have no impact on our
energy sector, which is essential for all countries. Our ties
with Russia are based on previous commitments and both countries
are determined to continue this trend.""
 Iran has said it would blacklist foreign companies that
avoided doing business with it because of the sanctions.
 But analysts said that now Europe, as well as the United
States had got tougher, Russian companies might be more wary of
doing any business with Iran as they would not want to
jeopardise relations with European trading partners.
 ""The question is will Russian companies actually want to do
business given that they are big actors in the European market,""
said Samuel Ciszuk of IHS consultancy.
 
 WILL THE SANCTIONS AFFECT INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICES?
 No-one expects Iran to hold back supplies to the
international community in the near future, especially as the
oil market is well-supplied and can absorb some disruption.
 However, the new sanctions could make its own fuel supplies
more expensive as it is forced to pay a premium to a smaller
pool of suppliers, while any surplus Iranian crude, struggling
to find a buyer could add to volatility.
 ""If Iran builds up storage and then sells a large chunk,
supply will come in waves. This could add price volatility,""
said Lawrence Eagles of J.P. Morgan.
 The accumulation of Iranian crude in vessels floating at sea
periodically builds up in part because of seasonal factors (it
tends to be the kind of heavy crude that is favoured for winter
heating fuel).
 An increase in Iranian barrels at sea can widen a contango
structure in the oil market, whereby the crude for near-term
delivery is relatively cheap, and increase the cost of shipping
if it commandeers many vessels.
 ""The contango is related to the cost of storage. Iranian
sanctions could affect the contango if they lead to inventory
build up that causes shipping rates to go higher,"" said Eagles.
 For oil prices, there is also a long-term impact as the new
sanctions compound the effect of years of restricted
development, punishing not just for Iran, but for an
international community that ultimately could face higher oil
prices.
 ""The Iranian oil and gas industry has systemic problems,
which has an impact for the long term,"" said Ciszuk.
 
 SWITCH TO ALTERNATIVE CURRENCIES?
 Iran could also elect to carry out oil transactions in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar and the euro, as the
currencies of those most implicated in sanctions.
 U.S. foes Iran, Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and Venezuela
have all previously raised the issue of non-dollar pricing, but
until the latest European sanctions against Iran, the euro was
viewed as a natural alternative.
 Following the latest sanctions, Iranian officials have said
they fear transactions in euros as well as dollars could be
blocked.
 Together with industry sources, they have said Iran is
considering selling its oil in other currencies, such as the
Chinese yuan.
 Although international oil futures are denominated in
dollars, parties involved in a physical oil sale can carry out
the transaction in whichever currency they can both agree on.

 LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro stayed below two-month
highs versus the dollar on Monday, dented by a downgrade of

 Moody's Investors Service downgraded Ireland's sovereign

 STOCKHOLM, July 19 (Reuters) - Mobile telecom gear marker
Ericsson has won its largest-ever managed services deal in
China, a three-year contract with China Mobile to maintain
22,000 base stations in Hebei province.
 Ericsson, the world's top mobile network equipment firm,
gave no financial details of the deal, but its stock was up 2.1
percent at 86 crowns at 0853 GMT, outperforming the European
Technology market, which was up about 0.5 percent.
 China Mobile Hebei has 35 million subscribers.
 ""It is one of the bigger contracts they could get (in
China), and of course they are continuing their good
collaboration with China Mobile,"" Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard
said.
 ""Strategically it is very relevant they keep getting these
deals since ... they need to move more and more toward the soft
side of the business instead of just being a hardware vendor.""
 China's three main telecoms operators spent about $21
billion last year building 3G mobile networks, following long
delays in the awarding of licences.
 In March this year, Ericsson said it had signed a framework
deal worth $1 billion with China Mobile, the world's biggest
mobile carrier, with more than 500 million subscribers.
 But the Sweden-based company wants a bigger share of China
Mobile's 3G network business.
 Ericsson said earlier this year it had only got around 5-10
percent of China Mobile's 3G business so far, with the bulk
going to local players Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp
.

 LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - The selloff in global stocks

about the pace of U.S. economic recovery kept markets cautious.

July and consumer prices fell for a third month in June,
highlighting sluggishness of the U.S. recovery.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI edged down 0.2 percent,
having earlier fallen by as much as 0.5 percent, while its
emerging market counterpart lost 0.6 percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index recovered from an
early fall to be 0.2 percent higher on the day. Asian stocks
excluding Japan fell one percent.
 ""There was a bit of a wobble earlier on with BP dragging
down the markets, but buyers have been returning with sentiment
being helped by M&A talk in International Power,"" said David
Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index.
 ""I expect the market to gradually claw back gains
throughout the day as investors await International Business
Machines figures due out after the market close.""
 However, investors sold shares in Austrian banks because of
their exposure to Hungary after the IMF and the EU suspended a
review of Hungary's funding programme, meaning it will not have
access to remaining funds in its $25.1 billion loan package.
 Erste group bank fell 0.6 percent and Raiffeisen
international shares slid 1.5 percent.
 BP shares shed 2 percent as investors fretted about possible
seepage from the company's capped Gulf of Mexico well.
 
 EURO SEEN CAPPED
 Sentiment for the euro was dented after Moody's cut the
credit rating of Ireland by one notch to Aa2. However, taking
the sting out of the downgrade, the rating agency placed the new
rating on a stable outlook.
 Traders also said the Irish downgrade did not come as a
surprise given Moody's had a negative outlook on the country but
the timing did briefly unsettle markets.
 The euro fell to a session low at around $1.2870 in the wake
of Moody's move, but swiftly recovered to $1.2960, up 0.2
percent on the day. Against the yen, the single currency gained
0.9 percent to 112.88.
 Near-term support for the euro is seen around the $1.2850
area, the 50 percent retracement of the euro's fall from a high
near $1.3820 on March 17 to a four-year low of $1.1876 hit in
early June.
 Analysts said the recent rebound in the euro, which hit a
two-month high of $1.3008 on Friday, might be overdone. 
 ""The euro's recent strength has been exaggerated by
positions, as people scale back from extremely short (euro)
positions,"" said Raghav Subbarao, currency strategist at
Barclays Capital. 
 ""As people square positions, we don't see much further
upside from here.""
 The dollar was little changed against a basket of major
currencies.
 With stocks recovering, demand for safe-haven government
bonds fell, driving yields higher.
 The 10-year German bond yield rose 5.6 basis points on the
day to 2.657 percent, while the U.S. 10-year note yield gained
3.4 bps to 2.983 percent, having earlier touched a 1-1/2 week
low of 2.916 percent.
 Commodity prices were off lows as well with U.S. crude
gaining 30 cents to $76.31 a barrel and copper climbing 0.5
percent to $6,533 a tonne, recovering from a two-week low of
$6,470 set earlier.

 LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro stayed below two-month
highs versus the dollar on Monday, dented by a downgrade of
Ireland and the suspension of talks between Hungary and the IMF,
but steadied as traders awaited results of bank stress tests.
 Moody's Investors Service downgraded Ireland's sovereign
bond ratings rating to Aa2 with a stable outlook from Aa1.
[ID:nWLA8628]
 The International Monetary Fund and the European Union
suspended on Saturday a review of Hungary's funding programme,
putting some pressure on the single currency.
 This means Hungary will not have access to remaining funds
in a $25.1 billion loan package. [ID:nLDE66H021]. Dealers said
this reminded investors of the region's sovereign debt problems
just days ahead of the results of stress tests on European
banks.
 ""The impact of the Ireland downgrade was muted as Moody's
kept a stable outlook. But we expect euro/dollar to remain
capped and think the stress tests will provide the last chance
to sell the euro again,"" said Manuel Oliveri, currency
strategist at UBS.
 He added the rally which culminated in two-month highs at
$1.3008 on Friday had been driven by a pull-back on short
positions, with no significant fresh demand emerging for the
euro.
 At 0730 GMT, the euro was trading up 0.3 percent versus the
dollar  at $1.2960, recovering from a session low of
$1.2872. Traders noted semi-official demand helping to push the
rate back above $1.2900.
 Market players awaited the results from stress tests on 91
European banks due on Friday.
 ""While European leaders believe that the tests will bring
confidence, the markets may not believe the sugar-coated figures
with the euro primed for another leg down in the weeks ahead,""
said David Scutt, forex trader at Arab Bank, Australia.
 Near-term support for the euro is seen around the $1.2850
area, the 50 percent retracement of the euro's fall from a high
near $1.3820 on March 17 to a four-year low of $1.1876 hit in
early June.
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 86.64 yen  but
not far from a seven-month low of 86.27 yen hit on Friday on
EBS. Asian trade was subdued with Tokyo markets closed for
Marine Day. 
 Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators have been increasing long positions in the
yen and cutting longs in the U.S. dollar. .

 By Tim Hepher and Ben Berkowitz
 FARNBOROUGH, England, July 19 (Reuters) - Leasing legend
Steve Udvar-Hazy kicked off a stampede of savvy financiers into
the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, as aircraft lessors opened
their cheque books to help pull the industry out of recession.
 Hazy, the mastermind of the aircraft leasing industry who
recently started afresh after leaving U.S. insurance group AIG,
placed a $4 billion order for 51 Airbus A320-family narrow-body
planes and said he would buy more planes soon.
 Hazy's former arch-rivals at the leasing arm of General
Electric weighed in with an order for 100 similar planes -- 60
from Airbus and 40 from Boeing -- worth $8 billion, and
delegates said Hazy could lift the combined tally to 200 planes.
 Add those to a $9 billion order for 30 Boeing 777 large
passenger jets from Emirates and the sleepy southern English
aircraft town was buzzing with talk of recovery after riding out
the industry's worst ever recession.
 Leasing firms, which buy aircraft to be lent out to
airlines, are the first to flee the market when traffic and
business decline and first to come back when activity improves.
 ""Right now you are looking at a very strong return for those
leasing companies. There is a strong demand for these products
and they seem to be taking advantage,"" said Richard Aboulafia,
Vice President at Virginia-based consultancy Teal Group.
 
 COMEBACK
 Hazy is credited with inventing the specialist industry when
he started his own aircraft leasing business in 1973 with his
college roommate and only $500,000 in the bank. 
 His company, International Lease Finance Corp, eventually
became the biggest customer of both Boeing and Airbus.
Udvar-Hazy sold it to insurer AIG in 1990 for $1.3 billion, only
to see it put on sale when the insurer had to be bailed out.
 Monday's orders marked the comeback of one of the industry's
most influential figures, one who once told Airbus and Boeing
how to design their planes.
 The orders are part of a tentative upswing in civil aircraft
demand, driven mainly by emerging markets and low-cost carriers.
 But lingering concerns about the broader economy were
keeping some analysts and executives cautious.
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief Jim Albaugh said he saw an
""uneven recovery"" in the global economy with the United States
lagging, but was reasonably confident about the impact of the
European sovereign debt crisis on the company's business.
 
 CLOSED-DOOR DEALING
 Farnborough hosts a massive aviation and arms jamboree every
other year, rotating with Le Bourget near Paris.
 Much of the real business done or prepared at the show is in
invitation-only chalets of defence companies, even though
several have reduced their presence to display belt-tightening,
and arms makers are bracing for heavy Western defence cuts.
 This week's star attraction is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner,
which arrived on Sunday, thrilling crowds of enthusiasts.
 The aircraft promises greater fuel efficiency and its
lightweight materials and innovative design have captured public
imagination. But glitches have delayed it more than two years.
 Airbus was showing off its A400M military transporter plane
and trying to draw a line under its delays and cost overruns.
 Pilots nicknamed the plane ""Grizzly"" when it took off for
the first time and this week workers sprayed grizzly bear paw
prints over the Farnborough grounds in a marketing ploy.
 Marketing stunts, a feature of air shows, are just the tip
of the iceberg in an increasingly bitter feud between top
planemakers over trade, defence and jet orders.
 Boeing has said a World Trade Organisation report last month
meant European nations must rectify illegal subsidies paid in
the form of loans to Airbus for plane development projects.
 The European Union will launch an appeal against the
decision this week, two sources familiar with the case said.
 The same companies are locked in an ill-tempered contest for
a $50 billion deal to supply tankers to the U.S. Air Force and
each is likely to press its case to worldwide media at the show.

 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, July 18 (Reuters) - Hungary faces a fall in its
currency and a surge in financing costs due to a failure to
agree with lenders on its economic plans and it will need to
reach a deal to retain the trust of investors.
 Talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU
ended prematurely on Saturday without a conclusion of the
country's programme review, which means Hungary will not have
access to remaining funds in its 20 billion euro loan secured in
2008 until a deal is reached.
 This is a risky path for a country which has a poor budget
track record and which runs central Europe's highest public debt
at about 80 percent of gross domestic product, analysts said.
 Although Hungary does not face an immediate pressure on
state finances as its 2010 financing seems to be secure thanks
to unused loans and cash reserves, it needs the lenders' safety
cushion as an external anchor of credibility.
 A lack of agreement on the current programme also excludes
the possibility of a new precautionary deal for 2011 and 2012,
which the country needs as a safety net, analysts said.
 This will likely force the new centre-right government,
which took office in May after winning April parliamentary
elections, to come to an agreement with the IMF and EU, but the
timing of this is uncertain, they said.
 ""This is fairly bad news and a mistake from the
government... the market impact will be negative with a likely
over one percent or possibly bigger currency fall and a jump in
yields,"" said Zoltan Torok, analyst at Raiffeisen.
 ""I'm sure there will be an agreement, as they (cabinet)
simply will be forced to do it, but I don't know when and the
later it comes the worse.""
 Hungary, which had to resort to a rescue loan from the
IMF/EU in October 2008 to avert meltdown, has since stabilised
its finances but its heavy reliance on foreign funding makes the
country vulnerable to negative shifts in market sentiment.
 This showed in early June when the government made confusing
comments comparing its fiscal problems to the Greek debt crisis,
which led to sharp market falls and seriously damaged the
government's policy credibility.
 Then the cabinet committed to this year's budget deficit
target of 3.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in an
attempt of damage control to reassure investors.
 But lenders said on Saturday that further steps were needed
to achieve the deficit targets this year and in 2011, and the
government needs to work out durable measures and spending cuts
to reduce the deficit and ensure sustainability.

 UNCERTAINTY AHEAD
 While the breakdown of talks with its lenders does not pose
an immediate financing risk for Hungary, it is yet another sign
of the government's unpredictability in its policies and
decisions which could alarm stability-loving investors.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban said after winning elections in
April that Hungary would not accept ""diktats"" from the IMF and
EU in future negotiations as they are ""not our bosses"".
 The cabinet has been on a collision course with the central
bank, mounting pressure on Governor Andras Simor to resign, and
pledging to cut his salary which has triggered a strong warning
from the European Central Bank (ECB) only last week.
 ""We doubt fundamentally the new government's commitment to
the IMF/EU deficit targets and their stubbornness around
enacting their pet policies such as the banking tax and cutting
the pay of the central bank,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at
Nomura in London.
 ""We now have proof that the supranational support for
countries is softer and not unconditional...The IMF and the EU
will not allow for moral hazard and free riders.""
 The European Commission on Saturday urged the government to
respect the full independence of the central bank.
 While the market reaction is bound to be negative, it will
be more on the confidence side rather than fundamentals as
Hungary has no immediate need for the IMF's money right now,
said Gergely Suppan, analyst at Takarekbank.
 Of the 2008 credit line secured from the IMF, the EU and the
World Bank, Hungary still has about 3.5 billion euros in hand,
and a further 1.4 billion euros at the central bank, which had
total FX reserves of 35.2 billion euros at the end of June.
""Hungary's government seems to have sufficient funds at the
moment and FX reserves in the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) are
high. Therefore, the implication of delay of this review is not
that Hungary runs into immediate financing problems--they are
not in dire need of the money,"" said Christian Keller at
Barclays.
 While the government is likely to resume talks with lenders,
uncertainty could prevail until the autumn, when Hungary holds
municipal elections on Oct. 3 where the ruling Fidesz party
wants to cement its powers at the local level.
 That is also when the government will need to finalise the
2011 budget which the IMF said would be a key issue in any
future negotiations. [ID:nLDE66G0B3]
""We think there is a mutual interest to get the negotiations
back on track, but the government may not be willing to make the
tough decisions it needs to make for agreement with the IMF-EU
until after the local elections in October,"" Keller said.

 * Exports seen rising further on global demand pickup
 * Private consumption still weak but to improve in H2
 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, July 19 (Reuters) - Germany's economy will likely
have grown significantly more in the second quarter than in the
first, the Finance Ministry said on Monday, adding that the
recovery should strengthen in the second half of the year.
 In its monthly report, the ministry said the improved
growth in Europe's largest economy was partly due to a pick-up
in the construction sector in the second quarter after a
slow-down over the winter due to harsh weather.
 Increased momentum in the industrial sector was also likely
to have contributed very positively to gross domestic product
(GDP) in the second quarter.The economy grew by 0.2 percent on
the quarter in the first three months of the year.
 ""Given the upwards trend in industrial demand and the
optimistic mood among companies, the economic recovery should
strengthen in the second half of the year,"" the ministry said.
 ""The recent positive development however should not obscure
the fact that with important indicators, pre-crisis levels have
not yet been reached and production is still below-capacity.""
 Germany emerged from its deepest post-war recession in the
second quarter of 2009 and recent indicators have pointed to a
pickup in the pace of recovery.
 German trade with the rest of the world surged in May,
while industrial output jumped more than expected, data showed
earlier this month. [ID:nLDE6671JJ]
 The ministry said output was likely to continue rising over
the coming months and Germany was benefiting in particular from
demand for its capital goods, as demand worldwide and
especially in emerging Asian countries picked up.
 ""The outlook for a further rise in exports is good,"" the
ministry said, adding that the rise in imports and domestic
orders pointed to recovering domestic demand.
 Private consumption was likely to have remained weak in the
second quarter but will pick up in the course of the year due
to a recovery in the labour market and tax relief for
households introduced by the government at the start of 2010,
it said.
 The ministry said it did not expect the labour market to
deteriorate, given that unemployment was decreasing as the use
of shorter working hours declined and economic indicators were
positive. German unemployment fell in June to its lowest level
since December 2008. [ID:nLDE65T0JW]
 The ministry added that consumer prices were likely to
develop ""calmly"" over the course of the year.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro pulled back from
two-month highs on Monday, as investors booked profits on its
rally while lingering concerns about Europe's sovereign debt
problems looked likely to keep a lid on future gains.
 High-yielding currencies like the Australian and New
Zealand dollars were also under pressure as subdued U.S. data
and falling equities led investors to shun risky trades.
 Trade was light in Asia with Tokyo shut for a holiday.
 The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.2904, pulling back from a
two-month high of $1.3008 hit on Friday on trading platform
EBS, with news that the International Monetary Fund and the
European Union have suspended a review of Hungary's funding
programme putting some pressure on the single currency.
 This means Hungary will not have access to remaining funds
in its $25.1 bln package.. Dealers said this reminded investors
of the region's sovereign debt problems just days ahead of the
results of stress tests on euro zone's banks. The results are
due out of Friday.
 ""While European leaders believe that the tests will bring

figures with the euro primed for another leg down in the weeks
ahead,"" said David Scutt, forex trader at Arab Bank, Australia.
 ""Heavy selling pressure is expected to emerge ahead of
resistance at $1.3100-10.""
 Near term support for the euro is seen around the $1.2850
area, the 50 percent retracement of the euro's fall from a high
near $1.3820 on March 17 to a four-year low of $1.1876 hit in
early June. Traders said there was talk of light stops around
$1.2880.
 The dollar edged up 0.1 percent against the yen to 86.64
yen but was not far from a seven-month low of 86.27 yen hit on
Friday on EBS.
 Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed speculators have been increasing long positions in the
yen and cutting longs in the U.S. dollar..
 EYES ON YEN
 Traders said with U.S. yields heading lower, the dollar
could break past support near its seven-month low.
 Such a drop could spark speculation of potential Japanese
intervention to restrain the yen, especially if the dollar
drops to a 15-year low by breaching the November 2009 trough of
84.82 on EBS.
 With the yen's latest rise having brought it to levels that
could cause pain to Japanese exporters, a focal point is
whether Japanese authorities will take steps to curb the yen's
rise, through measures such as verbal or actual intervention,
or additional monetary easing measures.
 ""We're getting into the territory where the MOF will start
to get a little bit more vociferous,"" said Gareth Berry, a
currency strategist with UBS in Singapore.
 Berry said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) may start to
express concern over the exchange rate, adding that such
rhetoric could help limit the dollar's downside.
 ""I think there is plenty of scope for further downside
beyond 85 before we actually see an actual act of
intervention,"" he said.
 Japan has not conducted any foreign exchange intervention
in more than six years, having last intervened in March 2004.
 When the dollar slid to the 84.82 yen trough against the
yen in late November, the BOJ stepped closer to currency
intervention than at any time in the preceding five years by
checking exchange rates with commercial banks.
 Soon after, the BOJ called an emergency meeting in early
December and decided to pump 10 trillion yen ($115.5 billion)
in three-month funds into the banking system.
 On Friday, a private survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment
weakened in early July to an 11-month low and capped a week
which saw U.S. data printing on the softer side, raising
questions about the sustainability of a U.S. recovery..
 A resulting slide in U.S. stocks hit growth-linked
currencies like the Australian dollar, which dipped 0.2 percent
to $0.8680. Earlier, traders said a model fund was seen selling
the Aussie, which shed 1.6 percent on Friday.

 By Koh Gui Qing
 SYDNEY, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro extended losses on
Monday, pulling further away from two-month highs, after
Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating, highlighting the fragility
of Europe's fiscal health.
 The euro quickly fell to the day's lows of $1.2868 after
the rating agency cut Ireland's government bond ratings to Aa2,
from Aa1, saying the country had suffered a ""significant loss
of financial strength.""
 The move came as markets are anxiously awaiting the results
of stress tests on European banks due out on Friday, and after
the IMF and EU suspended a review of Hungary's funding
programme at the weekend, saying the government must take tough
action to cut its budget deficit.
 The downgrade added to the gloom in stock markets, which
fell in Europe and Asia as a sharp drop in U.S. consumer
sentiment fueled worries that its economic recovery may be
stalling.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares fell
0.4 percent in early trade, while the MSCI index for Asian
stocks outside Japan dropped 1.2 percent, its worse daily
performance this month, as investors sold riskier assets.
 The Japanese market was shut on Monday for a holiday.
 ""The key issue driving the market at the moment is slower
global growth,"" said George Clapham, head of equities at Arnhem
Investment Management in Australia.
 Investors who believed the world economy is on shaky ground
got more ammunition for their arguments on Friday after U.S.
data showed consumer prices fell for the third straight month
in June while consumer sentiment dropped to a near one-year
low, the latest in a spate of weak reports.
 Major U.S. stock indexes slumped as much as 3.1 percent,
with the selling spilling over into Asia on Monday.
 Reflecting investor anxiety about sluggish economic growth,
sub-indices for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan share index showed
shares in banks and firms that sold non-essential consumer
goods were the worse performers.
 The financial and consumer discretionary sub-indices were
down 1.3 percent each.
 In Hong Kong, consumer goods exporter Li & Fung fell 2.6
percent, while Europe-focused retailer Esprit Holdings was down
2.4 percent.
 But some investors said that while the U.S. economy is no
doubt weak, worries that it may fall back into recession may be
overdone.
 ""It's slowing but it's very unlikely to get a double-dip
recession,"" said Khiem Do, head of the Asia multi-asset group
at Baring Asset Management, which oversees $50 billion.
 He said he had a slight preference for Asian and European
stocks because they seemed cheaper than bonds.
 Worries another recession may be on the cards have fuelled
demand in recent weeks for bonds, which are deemed a safer bet.
For example, two-year U.S. Treasury yields are near record
lows.
But there was no missing the weak tone in other markets. Oil
prices slipped below $76 a barrel on concerns that U.S. fuel
demand may wane, while safe-haven gold eased to $1,192.10 an
ounce after falling to its lowest in more than a week in the
previous session.
 EURO AWAITS BANK STRESS TESTS
 In currency markets, traders said they were not surprised
at the euro's pullback on Monday, saying it had been expected
after its recent rally, which has been largely attributed to
short covering and weakness in the U.S. dollar.
 By mid-afternoon in Asia, the euro pared some of its losses
from the Ireland downgrade news and traded at $1.2891 down 0.19
percent from Friday's levels in New York.
 For the year, the common currency has shed 10 percent on
worries about euro zone sovereign debt levels. That compares
with a 6.7 percent gain in the yen and a 5.3 percent drop in
sterling
 Monday's drop in the euro benefitted the U.S. dollar,
despite the growing concerns about the U.S. economy. The U.S.
dollar index against a basket of other major currencies was up
0.2 percent at 82.643.
 Investors are awaiting semi-annual testimony by U.S.
central bank chief Ben Bernanke on Wednesday for his view on
whether the economic recovery is faltering.

 EURO AWAITS BANK STRESS TESTS
 In currency markets, traders said they were not surprised
at the euro's pullback on Monday, saying it had been expected
after its recent rally, which has been largely attributed to
short covering and weakness in the U.S. dollar.

 By mid-afternoon in Asia, the euro pared some of its losses
from the Ireland downgrade news and traded at $1.2891 ,
down 0.19 percent from Friday's levels in New York.
 For the year, the common currency has shed 10 percent on
worries about euro zone sovereign debt levels. That compares
with a 6.7 percent gain in the yen , and a 5.3 percent
drop in sterling .
 Monday's drop in the euro benefitted the U.S. dollar,
despite the growing concerns about the U.S. economy. The U.S.
dollar index  against a basket of other major currencies
was up 0.2 percent at 82.643.

central bank chief Ben Bernanke on Wednesday for his view on
whether the economic recovery is faltering.

 * Painted paw prints kick off week-long marketing battle
 * EU seen appealing subsidy ruling at same time as air show
 
 By Tim Hepher and Andrea Shalal-Esa
 FARNBOROUGH, England, July 19 (Reuters) - Large Boeing jets
and short-haul plane orders from Airbus look set to dominate the
opening of the Farnborough Airshow on Monday in a test of
fledgling economic recovery.
 Boeing could grab a $5 billion order from Emirates for 20
777 big passenger jets and aviation industry sources said they
expected its European rival Airbus to chalk up sales of its A320
single-aisle aircraft even as it considers upgrading it.
 The orders are part of a tentative upswing in civil aircraft
demand, driven mainly by emerging markets and low-cost carriers.
 Commercial sales look more promising given double-digit
growth in air traffic, but lingering concerns about the broader
economy are keeping many analysts cautious. 
 ""The traffic numbers themselves are excellent, but there's
all this uncertainty and doubt about the strength of the
recovery in the background,"" said Richard Aboulafia of the
Virginia-based Teal Group.
 Farnborough hosts the massive aviation and arms jamboree
every other year, rotating with Le Bourget near Paris.
 For a week the quiet Hampshire town in southern England will
be transformed into an armed camp bristling with both the latest
smart weapons for arms buyers and shiniest new passenger jets.
 Probably the star attraction will be the Boeing 787
Dreamliner, a plane now in testing and built from composites. It
arrived on Sunday, thrilling crowds of aviation enthusiasts.
 The aircraft promises greater fuel efficiency and its
lightweight materials and innovative design have captured public
imagination. But glitches have delayed it more than two years.
 Airbus will be showing off its A400M military transporter
plane and attempting to draw a line under its own delays and
cost overruns with a marketing ploy over the plane's name.
 Pilots nicknamed the plane ""Grizzly"" when it took off for
the first time last December and workers were seen spraying the
paw prints of a grizzly bear over the airfield's grounds on the
eve of the show, as Airbus prepared to baptise the test plane.
 Britain's Royal Air Force has so far, however, ignored the
name and has not decided what to call the plane, leaving
marketers with a headache but hoping their name will catch on.
 
 BROAD BATTLE
 Marketing stunts are a classic feature of air shows but are
just the tip of the iceberg in an increasingly bitter feud
between the top plane makers over trade, defence and jet orders.
 Boeing says a World Trade Organisation report issued last
month means European nations must rectify illegal subsidies paid
in the form of loans to Airbus for plane development projects.
 The European Union will launch an appeal against the
decision on Thursday, two sources familiar with the case said.
 The same companies are locked in an ill-tempered contest for
a $50 billion deal to supply tankers to the U.S. Air Force and
each is likely to press its case to worldwide media at the show.
 Boeing and Airbus parent EADS also vie alongside other U.S.,
Russian and European players for fighter sales.
 Eurofighter, in which EADS has a stake, will announce plans
this week to invest in a new electronic radar to help it bid in
a contest for 126 jet sales in India, defence sources said. The
race is attracting most of the world's large defence firms.
 But a decision on whether to upgrade the most popular ranges
of Airbus and Boeing passenger aircraft with new engines, a big
gamble for either company, will not be ready for the show.
 While the two aerospace giants hog most attention, Canada's
Bombardier is likely to announce at least one order for its
C-Series plane designed to chip at Airbus and Boeing.
 Much of the real business done or prepared at the show will
be in invitation-only chalets of defence companies, even though
several have reduced their presence to display belt-tightening,
and arms makers are bracing for heavy Western defence cuts.
 Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies, expects a
significant first order this week from a Middle Eastern country
for the international version of its Black Hawk helicopter.

 SYDNEY, July 19 (Reuters) - The euro pulled back from
two-month highs on Monday, as investors booked profits on its
recent rally while lingering concerns about Europe's sovereign
debt problems looked likely to keep a lid on future gains.
 High-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand
dollars were also under pressure as subdued U.S. data and falling

 As a result, both the yen  and the U.S. dollar, which
are preferred when there is a spike in risk aversion, posted
smart gains. Trade was light in Asia with Tokyo shut for a local
holiday.
 The euro  was down at $1.2893 in Asian trade, from
$1.2933 late Friday, with news that the International Monetary
Fund and the European Union have suspended a review of Hungary's
funding programme putting some pressure on the single currency.

said David Scutt, forex trader at Arab Bank, Australia.
 ""Heavy selling pressure is expected to emerge ahead of

retracement of the euro's fall from a high of $1.3817 on March 17
to a four-year low of $1.1876 hit in early June. Traders said
there was talk of some light stops around $1.2880.

to 111.52 yen, from around 112 yen late on Friday when it shed 1
percent. The dollar also slipped against the yen  to 86.48
yen, from 86.60 late in New York on Friday.
 Traders said with U.S. yields heading lower, the dollar could
break past support around its seven-month low of 86.25 yen. Such
a fall could also spark speculation of potential Japanese
intervention to restrain the yen.
 Investors are closely watching the dollar against the yen on
the possibility of the greenback dropping to a 15-year low by
breaching the November 2009 trough of 84.82 on EBS. The yen's
latest rise has brought it to levels that could cause pain to

 * Cbank to hold rate meeting on Mon, seen wary of market
 
 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, July 18 (Reuters) - Hungary faces a fall in its
currency and a surge in financing costs due to a failure to
agree with lenders on its economic plans and it will need to
reach a deal to retain the trust of investors.
 Talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU
ended prematurely on Saturday without a conclusion of the
country's programme review, which means Hungary will not have
access to remaining funds in its 20 billion euro ($26 billion)
loan secured in 2008 until a deal is reached.
 This is a risky path for a country which has a poor budget
track record and which runs central Europe's highest public debt
at about 80 percent of gross domestic product, analysts said.
 Although Hungary does not face an immediate pressure on
state finances as its 2010 financing seems to be secure thanks
to unused loans and cash reserves, it needs the lenders' safety
cushion as an external anchor of credibility.
 A lack of agreement on the current programme also excludes
the possibility of a new precautionary deal for 2011 and 2012,
which the country needs as a safety net, analysts said.
 This will likely force the new centre-right government,
which took office in May after winning April parliamentary
elections, to come to an agreement with the IMF and EU, but the
timing of this is uncertain, they said.
 ""This is fairly bad news and a mistake from the government
... the market impact will be negative with a likely over 1
percent or possibly bigger currency fall and a jump in yields,""
said Zoltan Torok, analyst at Raiffeisen.
 ""I'm sure there will be an agreement, as they (the cabinet)
simply will be forced to do it, but I don't know when and the
later it comes the worse.""
 Hungary, which had to resort to a rescue loan from the
IMF/EU in October 2008 to avert meltdown, has since stabilised
its finances but its heavy reliance on foreign funding makes the
country vulnerable to negative shifts in market sentiment.
 This showed in early June when the government made confusing
comments comparing its fiscal problems with the Greek debt
crisis, which led to sharp market falls and seriously damaged
the government's policy credibility.
 Then the cabinet committed to this year's budget deficit
target of 3.8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in an
attempt of damage control to reassure investors.
 But lenders said on Saturday further steps were needed to
achieve the deficit targets this year and in 2011, and the
government needs to work out durable measures and spending cuts
to reduce the deficit and ensure sustainability.
 UNCERTAINTY AHEAD
 While the breakdown of talks with its lenders does not pose
an immediate financing risk for Hungary, it is yet another sign
of the government's unpredictability in its policies and
decisions which could alarm stability-loving investors.
 Prime Minister Viktor Orban said after winning elections in
April Hungary would not accept ""diktats"" from the IMF and EU in
future negotiations as they are ""not our bosses"".
 The cabinet has been on a collision course with the central
bank, mounting pressure on Governor Andras Simor to resign, and
pledging to cut his salary which has triggered a strong warning
from the European Central Bank (ECB) only last week.
 ""We doubt fundamentally the new government's commitment to
the IMF/EU deficit targets and their stubbornness around
enacting their pet policies such as the banking tax and cutting
the pay of the central bank,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at
Nomura in London.
 ""We now have proof that the supranational support for
countries is softer and not unconditional ... The IMF and the EU
will not allow for moral hazard and free riders.""
 The European Commission on Saturday urged the government to
respect the full independence of the central bank.
 While the market reaction is bound to be negative, it will
be more on the confidence side rather than fundamentals as
Hungary has no immediate need for the IMF's money right now,
said Gergely Suppan, analyst at Takarekbank.
 Of the 2008 credit line secured from the IMF, the EU and the
World Bank, Hungary still has about 3.5 billion euros in hand,
and a further 1.4 billion at the central bank, which had total
foreign exchange reserves of 35.2 billion at the end of June.
""Hungary's government seems to have sufficient funds at the
moment and FX reserves in the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) are
high. Therefore, the implication of delay of this review is not
that Hungary runs into immediate financing problems--they are
not in dire need of the money,"" said Christian Keller at
Barclays.
 While the government is likely to resume talks with lenders,
uncertainty could prevail until the autumn, when Hungary holds
municipal elections on Oct. 3 where the ruling Fidesz party
wants to cement its powers at the local level.
 That is also when the government will need to finalise the
2011 budget, which the IMF said would be a key issue in any
future negotiations.
""We think there is a mutual interest to get the negotiations
back on track, but the government may not be willing to make the
tough decisions it needs to make for agreement with the IMF-EU
until after the local elections in October,"" Keller said.

 By Krisztina Than and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, July 17 (Reuters) - The IMF and EU suspended on
Saturday a review of Hungary's funding programme, set up in 2008
to save the country from financial meltdown, saying it must take
tough action to meet targets for cutting its budget deficit.
 Suspension of talks means Hungary will not have access to
remaining funds in its $25.1 billion loan package, created by
the International Monetary Fund and European Union and which it
now uses as financial safety net, until the review is concluded.
 Negotiations with the lenders had been expected to finish
early next week. Analysts said the forint currency could fall
sharply when financial markets reopen on Monday due to
uncertainty over the international safety net for Hungary, which
has financed itself from the markets since last year.
 ""In an environment of heightened market scrutiny of
government deficits and debt levels, the fiscal deficit targets
previously announced -- 3.8 percent of GDP in 2010 and below 3
percent of GDP in 2011 -- remain an appropriate anchor for the
necessary consolidation process and debt sustainability, and
should be adhered to, but additional measures will need to be
taken to achieve these objectives,"" the IMF said.
 ""Sustainable consolidation will require durable,
non-distortive measures, which the authorities need more time to
develop,"" it said in a statement.

 HITTING WHERE IT HURTS MOST
 Hungary's new centre-right government, which swept to power
in April elections, has said it wanted to extend its current
financing deal with lenders until the end of 2010 and seek a
precautionary deal for 2011 and 2012.
 Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy made clear the government
was keen to resume negotiations. ""The government will of course
continue talks with international organisations including the
IMF and the EU,"" he said in a statement published by the
national news agency MTI on Saturday.
 Christoph Rosenberg, who led the IMF delegation to Hungary,
signalled that the Fund wanted more on next year's budget. ""By
definition when we come next time -- unless we come next week --
the government will have made more progress on the 2011 budget
and that will be a very important budget,"" he told Reuters.
 In an interview, he also said the IMF had not discussed the
possibility of a new financing deal for 2011 and 2012. 
 ""We are aware of what has been said in public but in our
meetings we didn't really get to that point, because we
obviously needed to first resolve the policy issues and those
have not been resolved,"" he said.
 The EU issued a separate statement saying the conclusion of
the review had to be postponed and further talks should be held
at a later stage.
 ""Hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path and
now has one of the lowest budget deficits in the EU. I welcome
the authorities' commitment to the 2010 deficit target,"" said
Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs.
 ""However, the correction of the excessive deficit by next
year will require tough decisions, notably on spending.""
 Hungary needs the IMF/EU safety net to keep the trust of
investors from whom it borrows. But the country remains
vulnerable due to its high public debt, which is equal to 80
percent of GDP, and its strong reliance on foreign financing.
 ""If we do not have the safety net of international lenders,
that hits us where it hurts most,"" said MKB Bank analyst Zsolt
Kondrat. 
 ""One would definitely expect a weakening forint on Monday. A
10-forint weakening (versus the euro) is quite plausible, and
nobody knows how nervous the market's reaction might be.""
 The forint traded at around 282 to the euro on Friday.
 Neighbouring Romania had to take tough steps last month to
secure the release of its IMF aid and reassure investors.

 By Andreas Rinke
 XI'AN, China, July 17 (Reuters) - Chinese premier Wen Jiabao
told a German trade delegation that China would not block
exports of rare earth metals, while disputing allegations that
China's investment climate has worsened for foreign businesses.
 European and American business associations have expressed
concern over the past year at Chinese policies that favour
procurement of goods and services with ""indigenous innovation""
as well as China's promotion of national standards instead of
international norms for technology and equipment.
 German business leaders called for open access to Chinese
markets, better intellectual property right protection, and
equal access to resources including rare earth minerals.
 ""Currently, there is an allegation that China's investment
environment is worsening. I think it is untrue,"" Wen said in
response.
 Wen said China would never block the export of rare earth
minerals to foreign countries, but said minerals should be
exported at a reasonable price and volume, the Xinhua news
agency reported. Those remarks were not made in the presence of
foreign reporters.
 Wen said foreign firms would be given the same treatment as
Chinese firms if they manufacture in China.
 Access to the Chinese market is particularly important to
German firms, many of whom still enjoy active exports to China
but worry about losing ground as Chinese manufacturers move up
the value chain.
 China holds about 90 percent of the world's reserves of rare
earth minerals, which are used in a number of electronic
devices, digital displays and military applications.
 ""I am worried about the conditions for access to these
materials,"" visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.
 Earlier this month, Chinese media reported a new central
government plan to fix monthly prices for rare earth metals in
the five provinces that hold much, but not all, of the known
Chinese deposits.
 Foreign traders, manufacturers and military strategists have
grown increasingly vocal about Chinese moves to reduce the
volume of exports of rare earths. Chinese planners say export
controls will prevent wasteful exploitation, support volatile
international prices and encourage high-tech manufacturers to
shift operations to China, where rare earth prices are cheaper.
 For their part, Chinese businesses also used the trip to
pressure German officials to move on issues of interest to
foreign investors in Europe. Chinese shipping firm COSCO said
the port in Hamburg needed to be deepened in order for its ships
to continue to dock there.

 By John McCrank and Jeffrey Hodgson
 TORONTO, July 16 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar suffered its
biggest one-day loss this month against its U.S. counterpart on
Friday as growing concerns about the strength of the global
economic recovery hurt commodity-based currencies.
 Canada is a major exporter of commodities such as oil,
natural gas, copper and gold. About three-quarters of the
country's exports are absorbed by the United States.
 A raft of recent U.S. economic data has come in weaker than
market forecasters had predicted, stoking concerns that the
health of the world's No. 1 economy is taking a turn for the
worse.
 The negative news helped the euro touch a two-month high
against the broadly weaker greenback on Friday.
 ""The Canadian dollar is getting completely sideswiped
here,"" said Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange trading at
BMO Capital.
 ""We are being sold off with the U.S. dollar as the euro
rallies, which is a break from risk-on/risk-off trade. What's
really going on here is they're selling all the growth
currencies such as Canada, Norway, Kiwi.""
 The Canadian dollar  closed at C$1.0546 to the U.S.
dollar, or 94.82 U.S. cents, down from Thursday's close at
C$1.0388 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.26 U.S. cents.
 It was the Canadian dollar's biggest one-day drop since
June 29. It fell as low as C$1.0580, or 94.52 U.S. cents, its
weakest level since July 7.
 Fears about the global economic outlook were fueled by the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary July
consumer sentiment survey, which came in much weaker than
forecast. [ID:nN16126985]
 Data this week out of China also prompted concerns among
market players that growth there is less robust than expected.
 ""We remain Canadian dollar bears because we think that the
increased uncertainty about the U.S. and the Chinese recoveries
will continue to weigh on sentiment and therefore your
commodity-based currencies,"" said Matthew Strauss, a senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The Canadian dollar is particularly vulnerable given that
the focus currently is on the weakness coming out of the U.S.""
 The next big Canadian-focused market event will be the Bank
of Canada's interest rate decision on Tuesday. Markets have
largely priced in 0.25 percent increase in its key rate.

 Generally, that would stoke demand for the currency due to
the possibility of higher returns, but that may not be the case
this time, said Camilla Sutton, a currency strategist at Scotia
Capital.
 ""Increasingly it's expected that even though they'll hike
interest rates, the statement itself may be more dovish than
the previous one, which could keep this downward pressure on
Canada even into the interest rate hike.""
 Canadian primary dealers and global forecasters surveyed by
Reuters expect the bank will raise its key overnight interest
rate next week by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, though the
pace of subsequent hikes is less clear. [CA/POLL]
 BONDS RALLY
 Canadian bond prices rallied along with U.S. Treasury
issues as worried investors sought the safety of government
debt.
 Stocks in the U.S. and Canada were lower, with Toronto's
main stock index ending down 1.47 percent.
 Canada's two-year bond  was up 21 Canadian cents
to yield 1.56 percent, while the 10-year bond  added
68 Canadian cents to yield 3.157 percent.

 By Nick Olivari and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - The euro stepped back after
touching a two-month high versus a broadly weaker dollar on
Friday as investors bet that gains supported by rising European
money market rates were overdone.
 A private survey showing U.S. consumer sentiment weakened
in early July to an 11-month low added to negative sentiment on
the greenback and drove the dollar to a seven-month low against
the yen. For more see [ID:nN16126985].
 Reports on U.S. consumer price inflation and capital flows
into the United States did little to change investor sentiment.
See [ID;nN16242811] and [ID:nN1699306].
 ""The euro is still relatively well bid and I would not be
surprised to see 1.3200 next week as people continue to want to
get out of these mature short positions,"" said John McCarthy,
director of foreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in
New York. ""It just got a little too far, too fast.""
 In late afternoon trade in New York, the euro was nearly
flat at $1.2935 , after earlier rising to a two-month
high of $1.3008 on electronic trading platform EBS .
 The break above $1.3000 will bring resistance at $1.3125
into play, the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's fall from
November to June.
 ""I don't think that we can conclude that today's move
represents a shift in sentiment, more just the result of
traders taking risk off the table as we head into the weekend,""
said Dan Cook, a senior market analyst at IG Markets, in
Chicago.
 Also bolstering the single currency was the recent rise in
euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rates that picked up pace on
Friday, fueled by a sharp drop in spare European Central Bank
cash in money markets. [ID:nEAP000481]
 ""The euro's going up on light volume. There's not much
liquidity today, but European yields are rising and that's
helping to drag the euro higher,"" said Paul Mackel, director of
currency strategy at HSBC in London.
 The euro has risen more than 9 percent from a four-year low
of $1.1875 hit on June 7 after smooth government debt auctions
in Greece, Portugal and Spain eased concerns about the euro
zone's sovereign debt problems.
 Stress tests being conducted in the European Union will
show that all the major European banks have sufficient capital,
the head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, said on Friday, further erasing concerns about
fiscal problems in the euro zone. Results of the stress tests
will be published on July 23. [ID:nLDE66F0Z6]
 Some analysts, however, said further weakening in the
dollar versus other major currencies, particularly the euro,
could be limited.
 ""The dollar's adjustment can be justified as the Fed may
have to do more easing, but in the longer term it could start
to benefit from safe-haven flows,"" said Jane Foley, research
director at Forex.com in London. ""If the Fed isn't going to
hike, it's hard to see the ECB hiking first.""
 Investors are closely watching the dollar against the yen
on the possibility of the greenback dropping to a 15-year low
by breaching the November 2009 trough of 84.81 on Reuters data
and 84.82 on electronic trading platform EBS.
 The dollar was down 1 percent at 86.62 yen  after
falling as low as 86.27 yen on EBS .
 The yen's latest rise has brought it to levels that could
cause pain to Japanese exporters if the gains are sustained.
The Bank of Japan's tankan survey showed the average forecast
for the dollar/yen rate in the year to next March among large
manufacturers at 90.18 yen.

 * Dollar index breaches key support levels
 * Risk, growth fundamentals both driving FX
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - A six-month rally in the
dollar has stalled in recent weeks on concerns about the U.S.
economic recovery, prompting some strategists to bet the tide
may be turning against the greenback.
 An index tracking the dollar against a basket of six major
currencies breached key support this week, suggesting more
losses could be in store. Activity in the options market and
speculative positioning both showed a significant reduction in
bullish sentiment toward the dollar.
 Selling in the dollar accelerated this week after data
showed slowing manufacturing and weakness in consumer spending,
while Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed policymakers felt
further stimulus may be needed if the recovery slows further.
 ""The turnaround in attitude toward the dollar has been
remarkably swift,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.
 ""The recent economic vulnerability set in motion by a slew
of reports indicating slowdown has coincided with declining
vulnerability of European governments and a pick-up in activity
in the region,"" he added.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> has lost 4.1 percent this
month after rallying about 10 percent from January to June. The
index made a decisive close below the key 84 mark on Tuesday.

 ""(It) was the most dramatic evidence we've seen so far that
the dollar could be in for a few months of corrective action
instead of just a few weeks,"" said Walter Zimmermann, chief
technical analyst at United-ICAP in Jersey City, New Jersey.
 The euro  has rebounded 5.8 percent this month and 9
percent since hitting a four-year low around $1.1875 in early
June.

 RISK VS DOLLAR
 For much of the time since the global crisis took hold in
late 2008, the dollar has moved in the opposite direction of
equities, rising when stocks fell as investors sought safety in
U.S. Treasuries and weakening when stocks rose.
 But recent declines in stocks have failed to boost the
safe-haven dollar as investors focus on worries about the U.S.
economy and the dollar's diminishing yield appeal. The spread
between 2-year U.S. and euro zone rates has widened against the
dollar in recent weeks.
 The 25-day correlation coefficient between the S&P 500
index <.SPX> and the dollar index was last at 0.21, Reuters
data showed. In mid-May, the ratio was a strong -0.91.
 Analysts said risk sentiment will likely continue to drive
the dollar's performance, though worsening U.S. fundamentals
could mean the dollar would sell off more in a risk-taking
environment than it would rally in a risk-off scenario.
 ""It does not mean risk sentiment does not matter. But these
other developments such as growth and interest-rate
fundamentals can and should matter a bit more,"" said Robert
Lynch, currency strategist at HSBC in New York.
 Samarjit Shankar, managing director for global
foreign-exchange strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston, said while
fears of a U.S. slowdown have grown, ""risk appetite is not
dying out completely,"" as evidenced by steady inflows into
emerging market securities and solid bond auctions in Europe.
 ""There's still a tremendous amount of cash in global
portfolios and that cash needs to be deployed into more
productive assets,"" he said.
 STILL LONG
 The value of the dollar's net long position fell to $3.82
billion as of July 6, according to CFTC and Reuters data. In
June, net long dollar positions hit above $23 billion.
 Jens Nordvig, senior currency strategist at Nomura
Securities in New York, said while dollar longs have fallen
significantly, ""it is still fairly large relative to history,
when we have been used to an aggregate U.S. dollar short.""
 In the options market, risk-reversal structures have ""given
back their huge bias towards a stronger"" U.S. dollar, said
Simon Smollett, senior foreign-exchange options strategist at
Credit Agricole in London.
 Goldman Sachs on Wednesday revised lower its forecasts for
the U.S. dollar. It expects the euro/dollar to hit $1.35 in six
months and $1.38 in 12 months.
 Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York, said some of the pessimism on
the U.S. economy might be exaggerated. ""Sometimes the price
action alone made people more pessimistic,"" he said.
 Chandler said the dollar could fall to $1.31 per euro and
85 yen in the near term. But he added: ""This is largely a
correction to what we've seen in the past six months. We're in
the middle of a larger bull market for the U.S. dollar.""

 * Opposition says will freeze deal if it takes power
 * Stories of huge maintenance contract untrue, says Ottawa
(Adds industry, opposition reaction)
 By David Ljunggren
 OTTAWA, July 16 (Reuters) - Canada will buy 65 new fighter
jets from Lockheed Martin Corp  for C$9 billion ($8.6
billion), one of the biggest arms deals in the nation's
history, Defence Minister Peter MacKay said on Friday.
 The first Joint Strike Fighter should be delivered in 2016.
The F-35s will replace Canada's CF-18s, which are due to reach
the end of their working lives in about 2020.
 MacKay brushed off criticism from opposition legislators
who say the planes are too expensive and who question why
Lockheed Martin received a sole-source contract.
 ""This is the best aircraft we can provide our men and women
in uniform ... This is one of the largest defense procurement
projects in Canadian history,"" MacKay told a news conference.
 The C$9 billion also covers weapons, training and
equipment. MacKay said media reports of a separate C$7 billion
20-year maintenance deal were wrong and said an agreement would
be concluded once the jets started going into production.
 The Joint Strike Fighter program is being funded by the
United States, Canada, Turkey, Britain, Italy, Norway, Denmark,
Australia and the Netherlands. Canada, which was involved from
the start, says it has already spent C$168 million.
 The JSF is set to be the world's costliest arms acquisition
program. The United States alone is scheduled to buy 2,443 of
the planes for more than $300 billion.
 Industry Minister Tony Clement said Canadian companies
would be able to bid for business for all the planes, not just
the ones Ottawa will buy.
 Don Boitson, vice-president and general manager at Magellan
Aerospace Corp , said the deal should be worth more
than C$1 billion to his firm over the life of the program.
 ""The announcement today gives Canadian companies like
ourselves and the other 85 (firms) the opportunity to produce
parts, and we have been and will continue for all 3,000
aircraft that are currently on order,"" he told Reuters.
 The opposition Liberal Party promises to freeze the deal if
it takes power. But polls show it trails the ruling
Conservatives and would have little chance of winning an
election now.
 In a statement, the left-leaning New Democrats said ""there
needs to be accountability and some justification for spending
this amount of money and we have not seen that"".
 MacKay dismissed the criticism, saying Lockheed Martin had
won an open competition in 2001 to supply the JSF -- a time
when Canada's previous Liberal government was in power and
already helping to fund the project.
 ""I am questioning the hypocrisy which seems to soar higher
than this aircraft in now criticizing purchasing the very plane
that the previous government signaled ... very early on, that
they were going to do,"" he said.
 But a former top Canadian defense official involved in the
decision to help fund the JSF said Ottawa's development role
did not automatically mean Canada had to buy the plane.
 ""If you sole-source, everybody loses,"" said Alan Williams,
estimating Conservatives had effectively sole-sourced almost
C$40 billion worth of defense contracts in recent years.
 ""We're supposed to buy a product that best meets the
military's needs. How do you know that without doing a rigorous
comparison? ... Just because we took part in a program does not
mean that it's the best one for us,"" he told Reuters.

 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Global share prices slid on
Friday after disappointing revenue reports from bellwether
U.S. corporations dovetailed with subdued U.S. inflation and
slumping consumer confidence data, driving up the price of
Treasuries as investors sought safety.
 The combination of reports undermined the fragile

 The dollar fell to a seven-month low against the yen, a

 The U.S. Labor Department reported consumer prices fell for

the rise was overdone.
 General Electric Co , the largest U.S. conglomerate,

 Receding concerns about euro-zone sovereign debt problems

 * No sign of credit crunch; no need to boost incentives
 
 By Brian Rohan
 BERLIN, July 16 (Reuters) - German companies are able to
handle an upswing in foreign demand without the state sweetening
credit conditions, a senior German lawmaker said on Friday.
 Michael Fuchs, deputy parliamentary floor leader from
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said
Germany's government agreed that the state should not be
creating incentives for banks to lend.
 ""It's time for companies to get back to business, and the
state to be involved as a referee instead of playing as an extra
man on the field,"" the pro-business Fuchs told Reuters in an
interview.
 ""I am strictly against us continuing to try to tackle things
with subsidies,"" he added.
 Germany emerged from its deepest post-war recession in the
second quarter of 2009. The recovery has picked up over the past
few months, and trade and output data for May has helped dispel
lingering doubts about growth in light of the euro zone debt
crisis and ensuing austerity measures.
 Some small- and mid-sized firms however say they need better
access to cheaper credit in order to quickly build up capacity
to meet surging demand from China and other emerging markets.
 As recently as March, politicians and economists had voiced
worries that Germany could face a credit crunch if investment
picks up and weakly capitalised banks are unable to provide
sufficient liquidity to firms.
 Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle then said after a meeting
with industry representatives on credit concerns that Berlin
would boost measures to secure financing for businesses if
needed.
 But conditions have steadily improved through the first half
of the year, and Bruederle said in June that he saw things
improving for the small and mid-sized ""Mittelstand"" companies
that make up the backbone of Europe's largest economy.
 Also in June, the Munich-based Ifo think tank said German
firms' difficulty obtaining credit had fallen for the sixth
consecutive month, with conditions at their most favourable in
almost two years, although smaller companies reported slightly
more difficult access.
 Fuchs, who sits on the CDU's business committee, said all
signs showed Berlin should now concentrate on exit strategies
from its stimulus programmes now the financial crisis is over.
 Fuchs has headed Germany's BGA export association and is an
expert on small- and medium-sized firms.
 ""There will surely be liquidity problems in the recovery, in
rebuilding stocks, and in adapting to rising demand,"" he said.
 ""Some companies will have trouble obtaining credit at
reasonable conditions because of lower ratings. But there is no
credit crunch and there will not be one anytime soon.""

payments for its crude oil exports to Europe to the UAE dirham
currency instead of the euro, the International Oil Daily
industry newsletter reported.
 The newsletter, a copy of which was received by Reuters on
Friday, said the move looked like an attempt to blunt the impact
of financial sanctions soon to be adopted by the European Union.
 It quoted industry sources as saying the state National
Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) had sounded out European term customers
about the possible change, but had yet to make a firm decision.
 ""There's something happening -- the Iranians are testing
solutions,"" it quoted one industry executive as saying. ""They've
put out feelers very recently about taking payment for oil in
dirhams.""
 It quoted another industry source as saying the move was
prompted by concerns in Tehran that euro transactions were no
longer safe and could be blocked by EU member states.
 ""Basically, they'd be happy to get paid in any currency as
long as it's not the dollar or the euro,"" the source said.
 New EU sanctions, which EU leaders agreed in June, are
expected to be approved by the end of this month.
 They will focus on trade, transport and key sectors of the
gas and oil industry. Energy sector sanctions would prohibit
""new investment, technical assistance and transfers of
technologies, equipment and services related to these areas.
 The newsletter said the EU would also introduce restrictions
against Iranian banks and target the European operations of
Iran's central bank.
 Although Iran's crude oil exports are priced in dollars and
are likely to remain so for some time, all of its customers pay
in other currencies, it said.

 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - The euro touched a fresh
two-month high versus a broadly weaker dollar on Friday as
rising European money market rates continued to underpin the
shared currency, but later pared gains as investors bet the
rise was overdone.
 A private survey showing U.S. consumer sentiment weakened
in early July to an 11-month low added to negative sentiment on
the greenback and drove the dollar to a seven-month low against
the yen.
 Reports on U.S. consumer price inflation and capital flows
into the United States did little to change investor

 Midway through the New York session, the euro was trading
little changed at $1.2933, after earlier rising to a two-month
high of $1.3008 on electronic trading platform EBS.
 The break above $1.3000 will bring resistance at $1.3125

November to June.
 Also bolstering the euro was the recent rise in euro-priced

in money markets.
 ""The euro's going up on light volume, there's not much
liquidity today but European yields are rising and that's

 The euro has risen more than 9 percent from a four-year low
of $1.1875 hit on June 7 after smooth government debt auctions
in Greece, Portugal and Spain eased concerns about the euro
zone's sovereign debt problems.

will be published on July 23.
 Some analysts, however, said further weakening in the

 ""If the Fed isn't going to hike, it's hard to see the ECB

on the possibility of the greenback dropping to a 15-year low
by breaching the November 2009 trough of 84.81 on Reuters data
and 84.82 on electronic trading platform EBS.
 The dollar was down 1.2 percent at 86.44 yen after falling
as low as 86.27 yen on EBS.
 The yen's latest rise has brought it to levels that could
cause pain to Japanese exporters if its gains are sustained,
with the Bank of Japan's tankan survey showing the average
forecast for the dollar/yen rate in the year to next March
among large manufacturers is 90.18 yen.

 * Warns politics could slow progress on Doha talks
 * Sees Canada-EU deal before Doha Round concludes
(Adds comments on Canada-EU talks)
 By Sam Cage
 BUCHAREST, July 16 (Reuters) - WTO member states must find
answers to bilateral squabbles if they want to achieve any
global breakthrough in free trade talks, Canada's trade
minister said on Friday.
 In an interview with Reuters, Peter Van Loan said he would
not point fingers at which World Trade Organisation members
were holding up the Doha round but warned that political
populism could slow progress towards any kind of free trade
deal.
 ""I think the key issue is that some of those countries that
are seen as impediments show some movement,"" said Van Loan, who
was visiting Romania as part of a wider European tour.
 ""I really think the focus of those at the WTO has to be to
find a way to get critical movement on the key issues,"" he
said.
 ""You need to have a sustained effort in the places where
rocks need to be moved.""
 The Doha talks, launched in 2001, aim to break down
barriers to global trade but remain deadlocked over differences
between the United States and emerging economies.
[ID:nLDE66F08N]
 Washington wants China, India and Brazil to make a bigger
contribution to a deal and says talks so far have concentrated
on agriculture and manufactured goods, with little progress in
services such as insurance and express delivery.
 China, India and Brazil retort that with hundreds of
millions of their citizens still living in poverty, they cannot
give all that it will take to clinch a deal in the Doha round.
 The United States and China have accused each other of
stalling progress. [ID:nLDE65P0GH]
 ""I know that there have been many who have said the answer
is another ministerial meeting or ministerial meetings, or
making it the major topic of discussion at the G20 conference,""
Van Loan said.
 ""I think that, quite frankly, puts at risk the credibility
of the Doha round ... I think those trying to advance the
agenda would be well advised to be focused in their efforts.""
 Canada is negotiating a trade deal with the European Union,
which Van Loan said would likely be completed by the end of
2011, boosting trade and investment flows.
 Speaking to reporters later on Friday via teleconference,
Van Loan shrugged off critics who say Ottawa picked a bad time
to negotiate with the EU as the global crisis has led to more
protectionism and has weakened the euro.
 He said a 2008 study that estimated the deal would boost
Canadian gross domestic product by 8.2 billion euros (C$11
billion) by 2014 was likely overly conservative.
 ""There are a number of factors that don't take full account
of the potential of the agreement,"" he said.
 ""One of the significant assumptions of that study was that
the Doha round would have been completed and all of its
benefits would already have been accrued. Right now it looks
far more likely that this agreement would come into place
before the Doha round would reach a satisfactory conclusion.""
 Van Loan said there was a tendency among some politicians
to use trade disputes to aid their popularity.
 ""In some ways disputes can serve as an incentive to work
towards a resolution, in others they may just politicize and
poison the environment and fuel some populist tendencies,"" he
said.
 ""I think the current political environment in the United
States may be a bit more of the latter.""

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Global share prices fell and
the U.S. dollar extended its decline against the yen after
subdued U.S. inflation and slumping consumer confidence reports
undermined a still fragile global economy.
 Rising corporate profits at a smattering of large
multinational companies initially lifted stocks, but once
investors parsed the reports and were disappointed with
revenues, shares turned lower.

reported consumer prices fell for a third straight month due to
lower energy costs. A second report showed U.S. consumer
confidence dropped to an 11-month low. For details, see

 * May ban imports of gadgets not enabled with GLONASS
 * PM Putin wants gadget makers to move production to Russia
 
 By Gleb Bryanski
 MOSCOW, July 16 (Reuters) - Russia on Friday threatened to
block imports of cellphones and other devices not enabled for
its own competitor to widely-used U.S. navigation technology.
Russia has been developing GLONASS, its answer to the U.S.
Global Positioning System (GPS), since 1976 but cannot yet
produce enough chips for mass manufacture of GLONASS-compatible
devices.
 Russia, as well as other emerging countries like India, is
keen to develop GLONASS to lessen dependence on GPS, which
Washington can switch off for civilian subscribers, as it did
during military operations in Iraq.
The chief executive of oil-to-telecoms holding company
Sistema, which is developing GLONASS, said the firm had held
conversations about the technology with manufacturers such as
Nokia, Siemens and Motorola.
""They understand that we will close the market for equipment
without a GLONASS chip anyway,"" said Vladimir Yevtushenkov,
according to the transcript of a meeting with Russian Prime
Minsister Vladimir Putin posted on the government's website.
 ""It is good that our partners understand that we will defend
our interests and promote our own product,"" Putin said, citing
Russia's experience with global car makers, which opened plants
after Russia abolished import duties on car parts.
 Yevtushenkov told Putin that foreign firms had accepted the
warning: ""They will get over it because the Americans at a time
when they were moving to GPS also protected their market."" 
 Under Sistema's proposal, consumer navigation devices
destined for use in Russia will be required to have a GLONASS
receiver alongside the GPS one. Such measure may force gadget
makers to move part of production to Russia.
 Yevtushenkov said that in 2010 Sistema will have samples of
GLONASS-enabled gadgets while mass production of GLONASS-enabled
devices may begin in 2011. 
 Sistema's subsidiary Sitronics is developing chips for
GLONASS navigation receivers after licensing a 90 nanometre
integrated circuits technology from Europe's top computer chip
maker STMicroelectronics. 
 Russia is also talking to Germany about Sistema's interest
in taking a stake in German chipmaker Infineon, a deal that has
been mooted since late 2009 although it is not clear whether the
purchase is linked to GLONASS chips.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - The euro touched a fresh
two-month high versus a broadly weaker dollar on Friday as
rising European money market rates continued to underpin the
shared currency, bringing large option barriers into play.
 The single currency eased off the session high as the New
York session progressed however, as investors bet that the
sharp rally on Friday may have gone too far, too fast.
 The dollar fell to a 7 month low against the yen with a

sentiment on the greenback. For more see [ID:nN16126985].

 The break above $1.3000 will bring resistance at $1.3125
into play, the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's fall from

 Also bolstering the euro was the recent rise in euro-priced

204,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2010 10:48AM ET</span>",Russia drought may prompt interest rate hike-analysts," * Drought, heat in Russia may hurt farm goods output
 * Risks of higher inflation are mounting
 * C.bank may consider hiking rates by the year-end
 
 By Andrey Ostroukh and Elena Fabrichnaya
 MOSCOW, July 16 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank may raise
interest rates this year to contain inflationary pressure should
a worsening drought hit farm output in Europe's leading wheat
producer, economists said on Friday.
 Soaring temperatures across large swathes of Russia since
late June have destroyed nearly 10 million hectares of crops and
have already cost the agricultural sector about $1 billion.
 On Friday, SovEcon agricultural analysts cut their forecast
for Russia's 2010 grain crop to below 75 million tonnes from 77
million-81 million tonnes, and predictions of poor yields have
driven up the price of wheat futures.
 With meteorologists forecasting at least another 10 days of
drought and heat, economists expect the price of vegetables,
fruits and grains to rise inside Russia itself, and some are
beginning to ask if the central bank will raise interest rates
before year-end to meet its inflation targets.
 ""So far there are no grounds to review the 2010 inflation
target,"" Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach said. 
 The government inflation target for 2010 is 6 to 7 percent
but central bank officials have pledged to keep the Consumer
Price Index rate below 6.0 percent this year. Prices have so far
risen 4.6 percent since the start of the year.
 August and September are months when Russian inflation
typically slows due to the abundant supplies of crops, but key
grain-producing regions along Volga river, southern Urals and
European areas have seen temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius
(85 Fahrenheit) for several weeks now.
 ""I think it will be an important subject. If such weather
stays for a couple of weeks, such scenario (hike in rates) will
be quite likely,"" Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa bank,
said. She sees 2010 CPI rate at 7.0 percent.
 ""Money market rates already tend to grow and the central
bank is likely to decide hiking rates by the year-end."" 
 Vladimir Osakovsky, chief economist at Unicredit bank in
Moscow, said drought-driven inflationary risks increase the
probability of higher interest rates closer to year-end.
 Before taking a break in June, Russia's central bank had cut
interest rates 14 times since April 2009, bringing the rates to
record lows to revive domestic lending and ease speculative
pressure on the rouble.
 Some economists doubt that a drop in Russia's farm goods
output will significantly increase inflation because existing
inventories and other sources can meet demand.
 ""It's not inevitable that inflationary risks will arise. If
we see low stocks imports will inch up,"" Evgeny Gavrilenkov,
chief economist at Troika Dialog, said. He forecasts inflation
at 5.5-6.0 percent.

 * South Africa under pressure to cut regional subsidy
 * Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland set to lose out
 
 By Ed Cropley, African Investment Correspondent
 PRETORIA, July 16 (Reuters) - Leaders of the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) agreed on Friday to reconsider how
they share their trade duty revenues, a move that could hit
Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho very hard.
Tensions have been mounting within the 100-year-old SACU,
the world's oldest customs agreement, because of a perception in
South Africa, easily its biggest economy, that its customs
receipts are bankrolling its four smaller neighbours.
 According to the International Monetary Fund, SACU revenues
account for nearly two thirds of official revenue in landlocked
Swaziland and Lesotho, just over a third in Namibia and 25
percent in diamond-rich Botswana.
 A communique issued at the end of a two-day summit of SACU
leaders in South Africa was thin on detail, but said governments
would address the ""challenge"" of the ""sharing of SACU revenue"".
 The issue has become sharper in South Africa since last
year's global slump tipped Africa's biggest economy into
recession, putting pressure on the budget and forcing the
Finance Ministry to look for cash in hidden places.
 For SACU's smaller members, however, any adjustments to the
union's complex revenue-sharing formula are going to be hard to
swallow.
 ""There are big political pressures on the South African
Treasury to revise the revenue formula,"" said Keith Jefferis, an
economist and former deputy central bank governor in Botswana.
 Revenue sharing was officially devised as a way of
compensating southern Africa's smaller economies for South
African tariff policy and its virtual monopoly on attracting
external investment because of its sheer size.
 However, the white-minority government that led South Africa
until 1994 also painted it as an altruistic subsidy of its
poorer black neighbours to deflect international criticism of
its attitude towards blacks.
 Now that South Africa has a democratically elected
government, that argument no longer applies.
 Furthermore, human rights groups and unions, including South
Africa's powerful COSATU labour federation, say the transfer is
providing life-support to unpleasant administrations such as
that of Swaziland's absolute monarch, King Mswati III.
 ""The likes of COSATU are saying 'Why are we putting money in
King Mswati's pockets when he's a dictator?' and 'Why should we
be giving that cash to Botswana when they're richer than we
are?',"" Jefferis said.
 However, South Africa will also have to consider the real
possibility of worsening the plight of Swaziland and Lesotho --
borderline ""failed states"" with HIV/AIDS rates among the worst
in the world and economies stuck in neutral.
 In April, credit rating agency Fitch cut its long-term
outlook on Lesotho to negative from stable, citing the lower
SACU receipts that were likely to result from South Africa's
reduced trade during its recession.
 ""After several years of positive revenue surprises from SACU
receipts, the prospect for public finances is now much more
challenging,"" regional Fitch analyst Purvi Harlalka said.

(Adds comment, detail)
 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Foreigners in May bought
fewer long-term U.S. securities, including government and
corporate bonds, and China cut its U.S. Treasury holdings for
the first time in three months, the Treasury said on Friday.
 Net long-term capital inflows into the United States fell
to $35.4 billion in May from a downwardly revised $81.5 billion
inflow in April.
 Purchases of Treasury notes and bonds fell sharply, with
foreigners buying a net $14.9 billion in May after snapping up
$76.4 billion in April.
 China cut its Treasury holdings by $32.5 billion to $867.7
billion, though it remained the largest single holder of U.S.
government debt. Japan, the second largest holder, also reduced
its Treasury stash by $8.8 billion to $786.7 billion.
 Official -- or government -- investors were net sellers of
all U.S. assets in May to the tune of $38.8 billion, a record
according to Treasury. Private investors bought a net $56.2
billion of U.S. assets.
 Though neither Treasury nor currency traders reacted to the
report, some analysts urged investors to watch future releases
for more evidence of weaker demand from foreign central banks.
 ""The pullback in foreign purchases of Treasuries may feed
concern on the ability of the U.S. to finance its deficits"" at
a time when yields are at depressed levels, said Todd Elmer, a
senior currency strategist at Citigroup in New York.
 The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note ended May
yielding 3.29 percent and had fallen as low as 2.88 percent by
July, a 14-month low.
 Nomura Securities rates strategist Stanley Sun, however,
noted that China was mainly a seller of Treasury bills and
actually bought a net $3 billion in long-term Treasuries.
 OVERALL NET INFLOWS RISE
 Net overall capital inflows into the United States, which
include short-term securities such as Treasury bills, edged up
to $17.5 billion in May from the prior month's $13 billion.
 Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX at BNY
Mellon in Boston, said the search for higher returns likely
soured foreigners on longer-dated securities.
 ""U.S. assets really haven't been up there among the
preferences of portfolio managers. Emerging market equities and
such have been in greater demand,"" he said.
 ""There does seem to be some willingness by central banks to
diversify, but it's diversification away from both the dollar
and the euro toward the likes of the Canadian and Australian
dollars, and that's consistent with the trend,"" Shankar added.
 After buying a net $10.1 billion of corporate bonds in
April, foreign investors became net sellers in May to the tune
of $9 billion. Equities also saw a mild net outflow of $432
million after attracting a $9.6 billion net inflow in April.
 Net purchases of U.S. agency debt, however, rose to $27.4
billion in May from $14.3 billion the prior month. In May,
agencies traded between 24 and 29 basis points above U.S.
Treasuries.

 * But business wants an ambitious one
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, July 16 (Reuters) - Trade is moving back up the U.S.
political agenda and there is scope to reach a deal next year in
the long-running Doha round and other stalled trade
negotiations, industry lobbyists said on Friday.
 But to get the backing of business, a Doha agreement must be
more ambitious than what is currently on the table, said
Christopher Wenk, senior director for international policy at
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
 ""2011 is going to be a big year for trade in the U.S.,"" Wenk
told reporters, saying the year would see action on free-trade
deals between the United States and South Korea, Colombia and
Panama, as well as a strong push on the Doha negotiations as
part of President Barack Obama's exports initiative.
 The comments are the latest in a series of hints that the
Doha negotiations -- launched in 2001 to help poor countries
prosper through trade -- are not as deadlocked as they appear.
 The G20 summit last month quietly dropped a call to complete
the Doha round in 2010, recognising the lack of progress in the
talks.
 But World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy
said in a newspaper interview on Friday that trading powers were
readying for the end-game in the Doha talks.
 And progress is possible in talks in the highly technical
but crucial area of non-tariff barriers, the diplomat leading
those negotiations said on Thursday.
 American businesses say that what is currently on the table
will not generate enough new trade opportunities to justify
their support. In particular, they want big emerging economies
like China, India and Brazil to sign up to proposals to slash
tariffs in key industrial sectors to zero, or close to it.
 
 INDUSTRY AGENDA
 Wenk was speaking after executives from Fedex, United Parcel
Service, AT&T, Qualcomm, Philip Morris International and
Caterpillar spent the week meeting counterparts and EU officials
in Brussels and Lamy and trade negotiators from other countries
in Geneva.
 ""The train is beginning to move. 2011 is doable. We need to
get ahead of the issues and make sure our priorities are on the
agenda,"" said William Lane, Washington director of Caterpillar,
the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment.
 Caterpillar makes machinery vital to emerging and other
developing countries as they undertake big infrastructure
projects and is a keen supporter of a Doha deal.
 ""We can get this done in 2011. Companies that fail to
recognise that are making a colossal mistake,"" he said.
 Lane acknowledged that the United States had taken a
""time-out"" on trade for the past 18 months, but said that was
now clearly changing, and business was worried that the U.S. was
being left behind as the EU signed a series of free-trade
agreements and Asian countries liberalised their markets.
 Caterpillar is particularly keen on extending existing
zero-tariff deals covering industrial sectors from the United
States, EU, Japan and Canada to the big emerging economies.
 It also wants a deal on re-manufactured goods -- a focus of
the non-tariff barrier talks, involving used products that are
stripped down and reconditioned to be as good as new while
saving on resources and energy, and reforms to anti-dumping
measures to stop them being abused for protectionism.
 The business lobbyists had a cool reception in Geneva from
China's WTO ambassador, Sun Zhenyu, who urged them to take what
was on the table now rather than waiting five years in the hope
of a better deal, Wenk said.
 But he said Washington was ready for concessions too.
 ""I know the U.S. has said to these countries: 'Work with us
here... We're willing to talk about your interests too. It's not
going to be a one-way negotiation, it's going to be a two-way
negotiation,'"" he said.""
 One concession sought by the emerging economies is highly
politically sensitive: a big increase in the number of temporary
work visas for their workers.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2010 08:36AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Stress-busting to lift gloom," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - The unveiling of details on bank
stress tests in Europe will help clear a cloud overhanging
global financial markets, enabling investors focus on the
attractive valuation some assets are offering.
 World stocks, measured by MSCI, traded sideways for much of
the past week as optimism from robust second-quarter earnings
ran into concerns about a soft patch in the U.S. economy. 
 Europe will publish on July 23 findings on how 91 banks
would fare if economic conditions turned worse, identifying
which banks need to raise capital. Comments from policymakers so
far indicate no explosive outcome is likely.
 Like U.S. tests announced in May last year, the results of
the tests may help open the door for private capital to return
to the banking sector, mitigating fears that the financial
sector is on the brink of collapse.
 This may in turn encourage investors to go bargain hunting,
especially after some risk asset classes show attractive value
after a recent sell-off.
 ""We believe the tests could be the circuit breaker to stop
the negative feedback loop between sovereign and systemic
risks,"" Gregory Peters, strategist at Morgan Stanley, noted.
 ""Positive economic news and stress test results would go a
long way towards reducing uncertainty. Aside from the direct
benefits this should have on financial markets, it could also be
positive feedback that encourages investors and companies into
more 'risk-on' activity.""
 The bank is most overweight in Europe in its global equity
allocation because of attractive valuation. Barclays Capital
prefers to be long credit heading into the stress results which
it says would improve confidence in the financial system.
 The latest reading on Europe's manufacturing sector due in
the coming week could also fuel a positive view, given that such
sector surveys and equity performance have a high correlation of
78 percent, based on Barclays calculations.
 
 VALUATION ALLURE
 The MSCI world equity index is still down 4.5 percent since
January, having risen more than 31 percent last year.
 Yet corporate performance has been upbeat this year. The Q2
earnings growth rate for firms listed on the S&P 500 index
stands at 27.6 percent, with seven percent of them having
reported.
 Next week will bring more key second-quarter earnings,
including IBM, Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, Apple
and Johnson & Johnson.
 ""You could well see a very strong Q2 earnings season in
which case fund managers are very poorly positioned for that,""
said Gary Baker, head of European equities strategy at BofA
Merrill Lynch.
 The BofA survey on fund managers has found that investors
view equities as the cheapest relative to bonds since March
2003.
 Investec Asset Management believes that equities globally
are showing exceptionally good value, based on a prospective
price earnings ratio for 2010 near 13 and a 2011 ratio below 11.
 ""The downside to equity markets appears very limited in
valuation terms and the upside could be considerable,"" Investec
said in a note to clients.

 * Bonds flat to slightly higher
 By John McCrank
 TORONTO, July 16 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar fell against
its U.S. counterpart on Friday, as growing concerns about the
strength of the U.S. economic recovery and the pace of growth
in China dampened demand for commodity-based currencies.
 Canada is a major exporter of commodities like oil, natural
gas, copper, and gold, and about three-quarters of the
country's exports are absorbed by the United States.
 Recent U.S. economic data has come in weaker than market
forecasters predicted and that has led to concern that the
health of the world's No. 1 economy is a little weaker than
recently thought.
 ""All of the commodity currencies have weakened off in the
last 12 hours on general fears about a deterioration in the
U.S. economic outlook,"" said Camilla Sutton, a currency
strategist at Scotia Capital.
 She said data out of China on Thursday also prompted
concerns among market players that growth there, while strong,
was not as robust as expected.
 At 8:05 a.m. (1205 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was
at C$1.0450 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.69 U.S. cents, down from
Thursday's close at C$1.0388 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.26 U.S.
cents.
 In the overnight session, the currency hit a low of 1.0467,
or 95.54 U.S. cents, its lowest level since July 8.
 The softness came despite a weaker greenback, which slumped
to a two-month low against the euro and a broader basket of
currencies. [ID:nLDE66F0RS]
 Most commodities are priced in U.S. dollars and a weaker
greenback makes it cheaper for holders of other currencies to
buy them. But the price of oil, while up about a dime, remained
under the $77 a barrel mark. [O/R]
 Gold was down at around $1205 an ounce as demand was seen
flagging, and copper prices eased as well. [ID:nLDE66F0VL]
[ID:nLDE66F0S2]
 The next big Canadian focused event that could impact the
value of the Canadian dollar will the the Bank of Canada's
interest rate decision on Tuesday and market expectations are
leaning toward an increase in the bank's key rate. 
 Generally, that would stoke demand for the currency due to
the higher returns it would generate, but that may not be the
case this time, said Sutton.
 ""Increasingly it's expected that even though they'll hike
interest rates, the statement itself may be more dovish than
the previous one, which could keep this downward pressure on
Canada even into the interest rate hike,"" she said.
 Canadian primary dealers and global forecasters surveyed by
Reuters expect the bank will raise its key overnight interest
rate next week by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, though the
pace of subsequent hikes is less clear. [CA/POLL]
 BONDS MOSTLY FLAT
 Canadian government bond prices were tracking U.S.
Treasuries and were flat to slightly higher after rallying on
Thursday on a safe haven bid.
 Stock futures in the U.S. were higher on Friday as
investors looked to equities after quarterly profits from
General Electric Co and Bank of America Corp topped estimates.
 On the U.S. data front, investors will be watching for the
latest inflation numbers.
 ""That will be very important, particularly with rising
fears of deflation,"" said Sutton.
 Canada's two-year bond  was up 1 Canadian cent to
yield 1.654 percent, while the 10-year bond  added 5
Canadian cents to yield 3.231 percent.

 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - The euro hit a fresh two-month
high versus the dollar on Friday, supported by rising European
money market rates which took it close to barriers at $1.30
while a deteriorating U.S. economic outlook dented the dollar.
 The dollar slid to a two-and-a-half month low versus a
currency basket as this week's poor U.S. data and dovish Federal
Reserve comments increased concerns about a slackening in the
world's largest economy.
 However, traders said large option and stop loss barriers at
the psychologically key $1.3000 level were being defended,
slowing the euro's gains.
 Easing euro zone sovereign concerns lifted the euro, along
with a further rise in euro zone bank-to-bank lending rates due
to reduced spare European Central Bank cash in money markets.
[ID:nEAP000481] [ID:nEAP000035]
 ""The euro has been supported by the combination of reduced
euro zone systemic risk after successful peripheral government
bond auctions this week and weaker cyclical fundamentals behind
the dollar given signs of slowing U.S. consumer spending and
manufacturing activity,"" said Lena Komileva, G7 market economist
at Tullett Prebon.
 ""On the other hand, the rise in Eonia and Euribor rates
since the expiry of ECB 12-month money at the end of June has
increased demand for euros,"" she added.
 At 1121 GMT, the euro  was trading up 0.3 percent at
$1.2974, close to an earlier 2-month high of $1.2986.
 Technical analysts said the picture for the euro had been
improved by Thursday's close above the Ichimoku cloud at $1.2785
for the first time since December.
 A break above $1.3000 would bring resistance at $1.3125 into
play, the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's fall from
November to June.
 The euro has risen more than 9 percent from a four-year low
of $1.1875 hit on June 7, helped by smooth government bond
auctions in Greece, Portugal and Spain easing debt concerns.
 U.S. DATA AHEAD
 The dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.4 percent to 82.235, having
hit a low of 82.211, its weakest since early May. Earlier this
month, the dollar index broke below the daily Ichimoku cloud,
suggesting more losses may be in store.
 U.S. inflation data and a University of Michigan consumer
sentiment survey due for release on Friday will be closely
watched and more bad news on the U.S. economy could give further
fuel to dollar bears, analysts and traders said. 
 ""The dollar's adjustment can be justified as the Fed may
have to do more easing, but in the longer term it could start to
benefit from safe-haven flows,"" said Jane Foley, research
director at Forex.com.
 Against the yen, the dollar  fell 0.4 percent to 87.07
yen.
 Market participants closely watched whether the dollar
could hold above its July 1 low of 86.96 yen, its lowest since
early December. A fall below that would boost the possibility of
a drop to 84.82 yen, a 14-year low reached last November.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - The euro touched a fresh
two-month high versus a broadly weaker dollar on Friday as
rising European money market rates continued to underpin the
shared currency, bringing large option barriers into play.
 The dollar stayed pressured, slipping to two-month lows
versus a currency basket, after a series of U.S. data this week
underscored a slackening in the economy's recovery.
 ""The euro's going up on light volume, there's not much
liquidity today but European yields are rising and that's
helping to drag the euro higher,"" said Paul Mackel, director of
currency strategy at HSBC.
 The recent rise in euro-priced bank-to-bank lending rates
picked up pace on Friday, pushed on by the sharp drop in spare
European Central Bank cash in money markets.
 At 0931 GMT, the euro was trading up around 0.2 percent at
$1.2970, close to an earlier 2-month high of $1.2983. Traders
said large option barriers at $1.3000 were being defended,
slowing the euro's gains.

 A break above $1.3000 would bring resistance at $1.3125 into

November to June.
 The euro has risen more than 9 percent from a four-year low
of $1.1875 hit on June 7 after smooth government debt auctions
in Greece, Portugal and Spain eased concerns about the euro
zone's sovereign debt problems.
 Analysts said further weakening in the dollar versus other
major currencies, particularly the euro, could be limited.
 ""The dollar's adjustment can be justified as the Fed may
have to do more easing, but in the longer term it could start to
benefit from safe-haven flows,"" said Jane Foley, research

 ""If the Fed isn't going to hike, it's hard to see the ECB
hiking first,"" she added.
 Market participants closely watched whether the dollar
could hold above its July 1 low of 86.96 yen, its lowest since
early December, as a fall below that level could boost the
possibility of the greenback dropping to 84.82 yen, a 14-year
low reached last November.
 Last December the Bank of Japan called an emergency meeting
soon after the dollar slid to the 14-year trough, and decided to
pump 10 trillion yen ($114.5 billion) in three-month funds into
the banking system.
 The yen's latest rise has brought it to levels that could
cause pain to Japanese exporters if its gains are sustained,
with the BOJ's tankan survey showing the average forecast for
the dollar/yen rate in the year to next March among large
manufacturers is 90.18 yen.
 Traders said there was talk of stop-loss dollar orders at
levels below 87.00 yen.
 The dollar was down 0.4 percent at 87.06 yen after falling
as low as 86.97 yen on EBS.
 The dollar index dipped 0.4 percent to a 2-month low of

 China's consumer price index rose an average of 2.6 percent
in the first half from a year earlier. The government is
targeting a full-year average of 3 percent.
 The National Development and Reform Commission, in a
statement on its website, said consumer price rises would
moderate after October. It added that imported inflation would
ease, in part because of greater exchange rate flexibility.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - The dollar stayed under pressure
on Friday , hovering near two-month lows versus a currency
basket, after a series of U.S. data this week underscored a
slackening in the economy's recovery.
 The euro remained close to a two-month high after gaining
1.6 percent on Thursday as problems in the euro zone took a back
seat and attention shifted squarely to the U.S. economy and a
dovish growth outlook from the Federal Reserve. 
 But analysts said further weakening in the dollar versus
other major currencies, particularly the euro, could be limited.
 ""The dollar's adjustment can be justified as the Fed may
have to do more easing, but in the longer term it could start to
benefit from safe-haven flows,"" said Jane Foley, research
director at Forex.com.
 ""If the Fed isn't going to hike, it's hard to see the ECB
hiking first,"" she added.
 At 0740 GMT, the euro was trading close to flat on the day
at $1.2935, after rallying to $1.2955 on Thursday, with topside
options structures hampering further gains.
""Heavily concentrated optionality around the $1.3000 level
contributed to the euro's inability to rally,"" a London-based
sales trader said.
 Technical analysts said the picture for the euro had been
improved by Thursday's close above the Ichimoku cloud at $1.2785
for the first time since December.
 A break above $1.3000 would bring resistance at $1.3125 into
play, the 38.2 percent retracement of the euro's fall from
November to June.
 The single currency has risen more than 8 percent from a
four-year low of $1.1875 hit on June 7 after smooth government
debt auctions in Greece, Portugal and Spain eased concerns about
the euro zone's sovereign debt problems.
 Market participants closely watched whether the dollar could
hold above its July 1 low of 86.96 yen, its lowest since early
December, as a fall below that level could boost the possibility
of the greenback dropping to 84.82 yen, a 14-year low reached
last November.
 Last December the Bank of Japan called an emergency meeting
soon after the dollar slid to the 14-year trough, and decided to
pump 10 trillion yen ($114.5 billion) in three-month funds into
the banking system.
 The yen's latest rise has brought it to levels that could
cause pain to Japanese exporters if its gains are sustained,
with the BOJ's tankan survey showing the average forecast for
the dollar/yen rate in the year to next March among large
manufacturers is 90.18 yen.
 Traders said there was talk of stop-loss dollar offers at
levels below 87.00 yen.
 The dollar slid 0.2 percent to 87.22 yen after falling as
low as 86.97 yen.
 The dollar index dipped 0.2 percent to 82.364. Earlier this
month, the dollar index broke below the daily Ichimoku cloud,
suggesting more losses may be in store.

 By Simon Johnson and Olof Swahnberg
 STOCKHOLM, July 16 (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Sony
Ericsson pinned its hopes on further growth in the smartphone
segment on Friday as it posted a second consecutive quarterly
profit, driven by sales of the more expensive gadgets.
 Sony Ericsson, owned jointly by Ericsson and Sony Corp and
which is the world's fifth-biggest handset maker, has cut costs
and revamped its portfolio with more phones such as the Xperia
X10 offering PC-like functions and links to social networking
sites.
 After a dismal 2009 when consumers cut back on gadgets like
new phones, the outlook for the industry has started to improve
and Sony Ericsson returned to profit this year after reporting
seven straight quarterly losses. Yet further growth will depend
on more success in the smartphone segment.
 However, competition here -- especially from Apple Inc's
iPhone -- is intense.
 Nokia Oyj, the world's biggest handset maker, issued a
profit warning in June saying its smartphones were struggling
against the iPhone, while BlackBerry maker Research in Motion
has reported disappointing quarterly shipments.
 ""We believe the challenging market conditions will continue
in the second half of the year,"" company president Bert Nordberg
said in a conference call.
 ""However, we believe the smartphone sector of the market
will grow more than 10 percent in volume this year and see good
... opportunity for Sony Ericsson to target this area of the
market.""
 Nordberg said Sony Ericsson would broaden its smartphone
portfolio in the second half of the year with cheaper offerings.
 Greger Johansson, analyst at research firm Redeye, said: ""I
think Sony Ericsson can continue with its positive momentum and
raise volumes in the third and fourth quarters.
 ""They have the platform, with strong parents, to recover
market share, but all their major competitors are focusing on
the smartphone market.""

 TURN-ROUND SITUATION
 Second-quarter pretax profit rose to 31 million euros ($39.7
million) versus a forecast 16.5 million in a Reuters poll. The
company lost 283 million euros in the same quarter in 2009.
 The improvement was partly due to success in newly launched
smartphones, which pushed up the average selling price (ASP) to
160 euros against a forecast of 134 euros.
 Erik Penser analyst Per Lindtorp said the report was strong.
""At the same time, Sony Ericsson is in a turn-around situation
when things can change quickly,"" he said.
 Sony Ericsson launched the Xperia X10 and Vivaz smartphones
in the first quarter and the Xperia X10 mini; its Xperia X10
mini pro started shipping at the end of the second quarter.
 Nordberg said new portfolio offerings had been well received
by operators and the company was in a good position to grow.
 Despite that, it stuck by a more cautious forecast than
analysts and its competitors. ""Sony Ericsson maintains a
forecast of slight growth in units in the global handset market
in 2010,"" it said in a statement.
 Earlier this month, analysts forecast global handset sales
volume would rise 11.6 percent this year, helped by increasing
smartphone sales. In April, growth was seen at 10.8 percent for
2010.
 Nokia, which reports second-quarter results on July 22,
expects industry mobile device volume to be up approximately 10
percent in 2010 versus 2009.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2010 03:04AM ET</span>",WTO's Lamy says Doha preparing for final deal-paper," BERLIN, July 16 (Reuters) - Participants in the Doha world
trade talks are preparing for a final deal but there is no point
setting an artificial deadline, the head of the World Trade
Organisation told a German daily.
 The Doha talks, launched in late 2001, aim to break down
barriers to global commerce but are deadlocked, largely over
differences between the United States and the big emerging
economies of China, Brazil and India.
 In a sign of the bleak prospects for a Doha deal any time
soon, G20 leaders dropped their reference to 2010 as a target
date for completion of the talks and set no new date.
 World Trade Organisation Director-General Pascal Lamy was
optimistic, however, telling Handelsblatt it was the first time
the G20 had had ""substantial discussions"" on the world trade
talks.
 ""The focus of the G20 was world trade and the economic
crisis, and everyone agreed that trade should not become a
victim of the crisis,"" he was quoted on Friday as saying.
 ""Participants are preparing for the end game of the world
trade talks. There is no point setting artificial deadlines.""
 Member countries have accused one another of not putting
enough on the table, and of seeking too much in return for their
own offers.
 The U.S. ambassador to the WTO told Reuters in an interview
the talks were stuck because of a refusal by China and other big
emerging economies to open their markets.
 Lamy said, however, that China was abiding by the rules,
adding that debates over statistical trade surpluses -- also
with regard to Germany's reliance on exports -- were artificial
and irrelevant.
 ""The statement that not all countries can raise their
exports is a macroeconomic consideration and doesn't make any
sense,"" he said. ""Each country can raise its contribution to
global production if trade is open.""

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 16 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened on Friday,
crawling towards a seven-month trough against the yen after a
series of U.S. data this week underscored a slackening in the
economy's recovery.
 Market players closely watched whether the dollar could hold
above its July 1 low of 86.96, its lowest since early December,
as a fall below that level could boost the possibility of the
greenback dropping to 84.82 yen, a 14-year low reached last
November.
 Last December the Bank of Japan called an emergency meeting
soon after the dollar slid to the 14-year tough, and decided to
pump 10 trillion yen ($114.5 billion) in three-month funds into

cause pain to Japanese exporters if its gains are sustained,
with the BOJ's tankan survey showing the average forecast for
the dollar/yen rate in the year to next March among large
manufacturers is 90.18 yen.
 Market players said there was talk of stop-loss dollar
offers at levels below 87.00 yen.
 The dollar slid 0.5 percent to 87.02 yen after falling as
low as 86.97 yen. Some speculative players who are betting
further losses in the greenback would be limited against the yen
bought back dollars below 87.00 yen, traders said.
 U.S. data this week, including retail sales and producer
price numbers have been soft, raising questions about the
sustainability of a U.S. recovery..
 The euro hovered near a two-month peak of $1.2955 hit on
trading platform EBS on Thursday, when it jumped 1.6 percent
against the greenback.
Traders said investors were shifting funds away from the
dollar and towards the euro due to a combination of factors
including receding concerns about sovereign debt problems in the
euro zone, worries about a U.S. recovery and strong U.S.
earnings results. Lower U.S Treasury yields also undermined the
greenback..
 ""Given the dollar's weakness, it won't be surprising to see
the euro rising to $1.3000, although the euro could tread water
in the near-term after yesterday's sharp rally,"" said Minoru
Shioiri, chief manager of forex trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
Stanley Securities.
 The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.2916, giving back some of
its 1.6 percent gain from Thursday, when it scaled a two-month
high of $1.2955 on trading platform EBS.
 Thursday's rally lifted the euro above the daily Ichimoku
cloud, meaning it has broken through a major resistance zone and
may have more room to rise. In another positive sign, the euro
rose above its 100-day moving average on Thursday for the first
time since December.
 One possible upside target is $1.3125, a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the euro's drop from November to June.
 EURO'S RISE MAY SLOW
 Although technical charts suggest the euro is still trending
higher, there were some indications that its rise may lose steam
for now.
 A senior trader for a major Japanese bank said many euro
option barriers were likely to lie at levels near $1.3000,
adding that the pace of the euro's rise may slow in the
near-term.
 The euro's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose above
70 on Thursday, showing that the euro had entered overbought
territory. That was also the highest since September 2009. The
euro's RSI was near 68 on Friday, still near overbought
territory.
 Earlier this week, minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest
meeting revealed policymakers may need to do more to boost the
economy if a sputtering recovery slows further.
 That was in sharp contrast to the euro's fortunes. The
single currency has risen more than 8 percent after smooth
government debt auctions in Greece, Portugal and Spain eased
concerns about the euro zone's sovereign debt problems.
 The dollar index dipped 0.1 percent to 82.443. Earlier this
month the dollar index broke below the daily Ichimoku cloud,
suggesting more losses may be in store.

"
226,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2010 01:48AM ET</span>",Q+A-Does China manage the yuan against a basket?," By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, July 16 (Reuters) - After China transfixed world
markets by breaking the yuan's peg to the U.S. dollar last
month, investors are now focusing on how the currency of the
world's third-biggest economy would be controlled.
 For although tensions between China and the United States
over the yuan's value to the dollar have eased a notch with the
latest depegging, U.S. politicians who believe the yuan is
undervalued are keen as ever to see the Chinese currency rise
from here. The yuan has risen 0.8 percent against the U.S.
dollar since depegging and in the NDF market, it implied
appreciation is 1.7 percent for the next 12 months.
 But before any predictions can be made, investors need to
first work out how China's secretive new currency regime works,
and key to that is understanding whether the yuan is managed
against a basket of currencies.
 IS THERE A BASKET RIGHT NOW?
 In theory, yes, but many investors doubt it.
 Since the yuan's revaluation in July 2005, China has always
said the yuan is managed against a basket of currencies. It
said so again on June 19 after breaking the yuan's dollar peg.
 Yet, many analysts believe the basket does not exist, and
that the yuan is still pegged to the dollar in reality.
 Nizam Idris, a UBS analyst in Singapore, said he monitored
the yuan for a period of three months between 2005 and 2008,
and a regression test showed the dollar explained 98 percent of
the yuan's moves.
 ""I don't believe they had a basket in 2005 and I still
don't believe they have a basket now.""
 SO WHAT IF THERE IS A BASKET?
 If the yuan is really managed against a basket, the biggest
rub is that the yuan could drop against the dollar and yet
still rise when measured against other currencies.
 This is because if China's central bank decides to keep the
yuan stable against a basket, its gains against one currency
are offset by losses against another.
 A basket is usually made up of currencies of a country's
biggest trading partners. In China's case, the dollar and euro
should account for the bulk of the basket.
 So if the euro resumes its drop due to Europe's debt
problems, the yuan should rise against it. Such strength could
then be offset by losses against the dollar.
 In a scenario analysis, Goldman Sachs concluded that if
China opts to keep the yuan's value stable against a basket,
the yuan could drop over 3 percent against the dollar in three
months.
 But many analysts believe this is not viable in practice.
 The United States is still pressuring China to let the yuan
rise, and China, on its part, would loathe to waste the
political capital earned from the depegging by letting the yuan
slip now.
 So why does China insist there is a basket then?
 Analysts said perhaps China genuinely wants to move to a
basket currency regime some day as it opens up its capital
account. But for now, its hands are tied.
 HOW WOULD A BASKET WORK?
 China has said before the dollar, euro, yen and won are the
main currencies in the basket.
 Others include the Singapore dollar, the pound, the
Malaysian ringgit, the rouble, the Australian dollar, the Thai
baht and the Canadian dollar.
 Since China offers only sketchy details on the basket, many
investment banks have resorted to designing their own
hypothetical yuan basket.
 Goldman Sachs designed a basket where dollars accounted for
24 percent, the euro 20 percent, and the yen 19 percent.
 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's basket had the dollar
accounting for 40 percent, the euro 16 percent, and the yen 12
percent.
 Given Singapore is the only central bank in the world to
manage its currency against a basket, its ""basket, band, crawl""
system is usually cited as a model for China.
 The central bank controls the Singapore dollar by managing
it against a basket of currencies of its top trading partners.
The exact constituent currencies in the basket are kept a
secret.
 Every day, the central bank allows the Singapore dollar to
""crawl"" about within an undisclosed band. When the Singapore
dollar is at the edge of either sides of the band, the central
bank intervenes to buy or sell the currency to nudge it back.
 While this model may work for China for now, some analysts
said it is not tenable in the long run as China would need to
forsake interest rates as a policy tool. That is not practical
if domestic demand is to drive more of China's future growth.

 * Economy, which is slowing, headed in right direction
 * China confident euro zone will surmount debt woes
 (Adds Merkel reaction, fresh Wen comments)
 BEIJING, July 16 (Reuters) - China will stick with the
policies that cooled economic growth last quarter and will keep
faith with the euro despite Europe's debt problems, Premier Wen
Jiabao said on Friday.
 At a joint news conference with visiting German Chancellor
Angela Merkel, Wen said the world's third-largest economy was
trending in the direction that the government wanted.
 ""We will maintain policy continuity and stability and
continue to put into effect a proactive fiscal policy and an
appropriately loose monetary policy,"" Wen said.
 He was speaking a day after China reported a moderation in
annual gross domestic product growth to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from 11.9 percent in the first three months of
the year.
 The premier attributed the slowdown to a high base of
comparison in 2009 and to his government's macro-economic
controls, which include steps to limit lending to property
developers, home buyers and indebted local governments.
 Policymakers would strive to implement the controls more
flexibly and to target them better, Wen said.
 ""Generally speaking, we must maintain steady and relatively
fast economic growth and further increase the driving force of
domestic demand in the economic recovery,"" he said.
 Wen also offered his support to the euro zone, which is
battling to regain investor confidence after Greece had to be
bailed out in April by the single currency bloc, fanning fears
about other heavily indebted European governments.
 ""I want to say that at this time, when some European
countries are suffering sovereign debt crises, China has always
held out a helping hand,"" he said.
 China supports the economic stabilisation efforts of
European governments and hopes they will succeed in nursing
their public finances back to normal as soon as possible, the
premier added.
 ""We believe that with the joint hard work of the
international community, Europe will certainly overcome its
difficulties,"" he said.
 China is a responsible, long-term investor that has always
pursued the principle of diversifying its investments, Wen
said.
 ""The European market has been in the past, is now and will
be in the future one of the main investment markets for China's
foreign exchange reserves,"" he said.
 Merkel welcomed Wen's support. ""It's an important signal
that China, too, has made it clear that it has confidence in
the euro,"" she said.
 China does not disclose the currency composition of its
$2.45 trillion stockpile of reserves, the world's largest, but
bankers assume that perhaps two-thirds is invested in dollars
with a big chunk of the remainder parked in euros.

December.
 It has risen about 8.7 percent from its lows as forex
traders focus shifted away from euro zone woes to a slowing
U.S. The euro is still just under 15 percent below its November
2009 levels.
 The dollar is likely to come under increasing pressure as
the U.S. economy slows and others in the world raise rates to
fend off inflation, making their currencies more attractive
HSBC Global Research said in a note.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 16 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened to near
2-1/2-month lows against a basket on currencies on Friday, with
the euro's outlook positive after a short-covering rally lifted
it through key resistance levels.
 Traders said investors were shifting funds away from the
dollar and towards the euro due to combination of factors
including receding concerns about sovereign debt problems in the
euro zone, worries about a U.S. recovery and strong U.S. earnings
results. Lower U.S Treasury yields also undermined the
greenback..
 The euro dipped 0.3 percent to $1.2915, giving back some of
its 1.6 percent gain from Thursday, when it scaled a two-month
high of $1.2955 on trading platform EBS.
 Thursday's rally lifted the euro above the daily Ichimoku
cloud, meaning it has broken through a major resistance zone and
may have more room to rise. In another positive sign, the euro
rose above its 100-day moving average on Thursday for the first
time since December.
 One possible upside target is $1.3125, a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the euro's drop from November to June.
 ""The feeling is that the euro will certainly test the $1.30
level again, although there will be sellers around that level,""
said Charles Han, head of Asia-Pacific foreign exchange trading
at the Newedge Group in Hong Kong.
 Traders said efforts to cover bets against the euro that had
built up in recent months accelerated its rise the previous day,
as did demand for euro call options with strikes at $1.2825,
$1.2835 and $1.2855.
 Stop-loss buying of the euro by option desks that were short
gamma, which means they had to buy the euro as it rose to hedge
their books, also helped fuel the euro's rally on Thursday,
market players said.
 EURO'S RISE MAY SLOW
 Although technical charts suggest the euro is still trending
higher, there were some indications that its rise may lose steam
for now.
 A senior trader for a major Japanese bank said many euro
option barriers were likely to lie at levels near $1.3000, adding
that the pace of the euro's rise may slow in the near-term.
 The euro's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) rose above 70
on Thursday, showing that the euro had entered overbought
territory. That was also the highest since September 2009. The
euro's RSI was near 68 on Friday, still near overbought
territory.
 Hiroshi Maeba, executive director of foreign exchange trading
for Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said short-covering in the euro
may also have run its course, at least for the time being.
 ""I think it has reached pretty good levels, with positions
having been cleaned out for now,"" he said.
 ""A rise toward $1.3000 is a possibility, but I don't get the
sense that we are in a situation where there will be aggressive
buying at levels above that,"" Maeba said.
 U.S. data this week, including retail sales and producer
price numbers have been soft, raising questions about the
sustainability of a U.S. recovery..
 Earlier this week, minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest
meeting revealed policymakers may need to do more to boost the
economy if a sputtering recovery slows further.
 That was in sharp contrast to the euro's fortunes. The single
currency has risen more than 8 percent after smooth government
debt auctions in Greece, Portugal and Spain eased concerns about
the euro zone's sovereign debt problems.
 The dollar index dipped 0.1 percent to 82.463. Earlier this
month the dollar index broke below the daily Ichimoku cloud,
suggesting more losses may be in store.
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent against the yen to 87.24 yen,
edging back toward a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit in early
July.
 Market players said there was talk of stop-loss dollar offers
at levels below 87.00 yen.

 SYDNEY, July 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was weak near

a burst of short-covering lifted the euro through key resistance
levels in what could be a taste of things to come.

of the index's rise from a low of 74.17 in November 2009 to a
high of 88.59 on June 8.
 The euro rose to $1.2920 , from around $1.2813 late in

remains an open question,"" David Watt, senior currency strategist
at RBC Capital wrote in a morning note.

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - World stocks staged a late-day
surge to end flat on Thursday following positive developments at BP
Plc   and Goldman Sachs , while the dollar fell
broadly on downbeat U.S. manufacturing and inflation data.
 U.S.-listed shares of BP jumped as much as 10 percent after the
company said it conducted pressure tests on its blown-out Gulf of
Mexico well and found no oil leaking into the ocean for the first
time since the accident happened in April. BP's shares settled 7.57
percent higher at $38.92 in New York trading. For details, see
[ID:nLDE66E0MK]
 Late-day developments involving Goldman Sachs also contributed to
the stock market's rebound in the last half hour of regular trading.
Goldman Sachs' stock, which gained 4.43 percent to close at $145.22
in New York, continued its rally after the bell and rose nearly 2
percent in extended-hours trading. Goldman's stock last traded at
$147.90, up 1.85 percent from its NYSE close. For details, see
[ID:nWEN7077]
 ""In essence, you'll have 'closure' on two issues,"" said Quincy
Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New
Jersey. ""An announcement along the lines of BP's announcement, and
the Goldman Sachs issue closed, if that's what it is, that would help
the tone of the market quite handsomely.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> closed flattish,
after moving lower in sympathy with U.S. markets for much of
Thursday. The Thomson Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU>
settled slightly higher after being pressured lower during most of
the trading day as well.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slipped 7.41 points, or
0.07 percent, to end at 10,359.31. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> inched up 1.31 points, or 0.12 percent, to finish at 1,096.48.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> edged down 0.76 of a point, or
0.03 percent, to close at 2,249.08.
 Other markets were still heavily weighed by the rash of downbeat
U.S. manufacturing and inflation data.
 The rate of growth in the factory sector slowed sharply in July
and U.S. wholesale prices fell for a third straight month, adding to
evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is losing steam. The decline
in U.S. producer prices appeared to raise the prospect of a
deflationary spiral of lower prices, wages and business activity.
 Financial markets all week have battled conflicting signals from
data showing a slowdown in the U.S. economy's recovery on the one
hand and strong corporate earnings on the other hand.
 U.S. Treasuries prices also rose as the data raised the
possibility that the Federal Reserve could turn to a second round of
extraordinary measures to stimulate the economy.
 ""Death, destruction, story at six. Come on, what more do we need
to know here? Double-dip is here, there is no doubt about it,"" said
Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New
Jersey.
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reported that factory
activity growth in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region fell, with its
business activity index dropping to 5.1 in July from 8.0 in June.
 The New York Federal Reserve Bank said manufacturing in New York
State hit the lowest level since December 2009, while U.S. producer
prices fell 0.5 percent last month.
 The negative data overshadowed an unexpectedly large drop in
first-time claims for jobless benefits last week, with claims falling
29,000 to a two-year low of 429,000 as seasonal layoffs at factories
eased. For details, see [ID:nN15204522] and [ID:nN15208925]
 European shares moved in sympathy with U.S. markets. The
pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top shares fell 1.1
percent to close at 1,033.562 points, the biggest one-day percentage
fall since July 1. At midday in New York, the three major U.S. stock
indexes were down 1 percent, with the broad FTSEurofirst 300's
decline matching it at the time as the European trading session
ended.
 In currencies, the dollar was down against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down
1.31 percent at 82.337 from a previous session close of 83.426.
 The euro  soared to a two-month high above $1.29.
 It was up 1.56 percent at $1.2939 from a previous session close
of $1.2740. Debt trouble in the euro zone had pushed it below $1.19
last month, but fairly smooth bond auctions in Greece, Portugal and
Spain have since eased concern.
 The data ""is going to give traders further reason to dump the
dollar as the risk shifts from Europe to the United States,"" said
Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT Forex in New York.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 1.13 percent
at 87.44 from a previous session close of 88.440.
 CHINA STOCKS FALL AFTER DEBUT
 China's key stock index ended 1.9 percent lower, its biggest fall
in two weeks, as Agricultural Bank of China disappointed with a
lackluster Shanghai debut. AgBank, the most active stock, ended up
0.8 percent at 2.7 yuan compared with its IPO price of 2.68 yuan.
 Earlier data showed China's economic growth moderated to 10.3
percent in the second quarter from 11.9 percent in the first quarter,
slightly below forecasts of 10.5 percent growth.
 All told, Treasuries were one of the biggest beneficiaries on
Thursday even with equities' late-day rebound. The benchmark 10-year
U.S. Treasury note  was up 17/32, with the yield at 2.99
percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was unchanged with
the yield at 0.61 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond 
was up 1-4/32, with the yield at 3.97 percent.
U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell 42 cents, or 0.55 percent,
to settle at $76.62 per barrel, and spot gold prices  rose
slightly by $1.15, or 0.10 percent, to $1,208.60. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB> was up 2.01 points, or 0.77
percent, to close at 264.21.

 TORONTO, July 15 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar touched
its lowest level in nearly a week against the greenback on
Thursday, hit by U.S. data that fueled worries about the
economic health of Canada's biggest trading partner.
 Investor sentiment soured after a gauge of factory activity
in New York state fell sharply and a third monthly drop in
wholesale prices in June fueled worries about deflation.
[ID:nEAH104F00] [ID:nN15196157]
 The currency fell to C$1.0443 to the U.S. dollar, its
lowest level since July 9, as the U.S. data sparked a broader
selloff in riskier assets, sending U.S. Treasury bonds higher
and weighing on global equities -- though Toronto's main stock
index <.GSPTSE> ended 1 percent higher thanks to a late rally
[.TO].
 ""(It's) worries over what's happening with the U.S. in
terms of weak data, a weak equity market. I guess the question
is, is that going to have an effect on Canada and slow down the
Canadian economy,"" said Steve Butler, director of foreign
exchange trading at Scotia Capital.
 ""That's really the biggest fear right now.""
 The Canadian dollar  ended at C$1.0388 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.26 U.S. cents, down from Wednesday's close at
C$1.0341 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.70 U.S. cents.
 The U.S. dollar fell broadly on Thursday, and the euro
soared as soft inflation and manufacturing data added to
concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy. [FRX/]
 ""The market is starting to change its tone now. The darkest
fears about Europe are starting to dissipate and attention is
turning over to the U.S.,"" said Butler.
 There is a reversion back to ""more longer-term fundamentals
and based on the weakening sentiment with respect to U.S.
economics,"" said Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign
exchange at National Bank Financial.
 ""Money is flying out of the States and back into euro, away
from commodities and away from commodity-related currencies.""
 The weak U.S. data added to jitters fueled by data from
China that showed a slowdown in its economy. [MKTS/GLOB]
 It also comes a day after minutes from a U.S. Federal
Reserve meeting showed policymakers felt they should stand
ready to do more to boost the economy if the outlook worsens.
 The soft data also weighed on commodity prices, notably the
price of oil, which fell below $77 a barrel. Canada is the No.
1 exporter of oil to the United States. [O/R]
 Scotia's Butler said key technical levels include C$1.0411
to the U.S. dollar, or the 55-day moving average, and C$1.0412,
which is the 200-day moving average.
 ""A lot of technicians will look at when those moving
averages cross. If Canada continues to weaken off they'll
likely cross and that will turn people from bullish (on the
Canadian dollar) to bearish,"" said Butler.
 BONDS HIGHER
 Canadian government bond prices followed their U.S.
counterparts higher on Thursday as the weak U.S. data guided
investors to the relatively safety of government debt. [US/]
 ""The market still has that underlying fear that a weaker
U.S. economy is going to be tough for the Canadian economy.
It's not 100 percent correlated, but the market has got that in
the back of their mind. It's a bit of a worry,"" said Butler.
 The next key Canadian-driven event for the market will be
the Bank of Canada's interest rate announcement on July 20, and
market expectations are leaning toward a rate increase.

 Canadian primary dealers and global forecasters surveyed by
Reuters expect the bank will raise its key overnight interest
rate next week by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, though the
pace of subsequent hikes is less clear. [CA/POLL]
 The two-year bond  was up 12 Canadian cents to
yield 1.654 percent, while the 10-year bond  added
25 Canadian cents to yield 3.773 percent.
 Canadian bonds notched a mix performance versus U.S.
issues. The two-year bond underperformed, with the yield
 104 basis points above its U.S. counterpart,
compared with about 110 basis points in the previous session.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2010 03:12PM ET</span>",European turmoil helps stall trans-Atlantic tourism," * Europe economic troubles deters tourism to North America
 * Caribbean countries suffering drop in European tourists
 By Michelle Nichols
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - A bumpy European economic
recovery and battered currency have helped stall European
tourism to North America especially the Caribbean and Mexico,
though Canada is faring better, tourism experts say.
 The number of Europeans visiting the United States and
Canada fell 10 percent last year, according to government data,
as cash-strapped consumers opted for vacations nearer home and
business travel froze.
 Despite the debt crises buffeting Greece and some other
European countries and a euro which has weakened up to 15
percent against the U.S. dollar this year, the number of
Europeans visiting the United States remained flat for January
and February, said the U.S. Office of Travel and Tourism
Industries.
 The Office described March, for which figures have not yet
been released, as ""generally positive,"" but said April figures
would be hurt by flight cancellations due to an ash cloud from
a volcano eruption in Iceland.
 ""It may take a while for people to feel good enough about
their future job prospects to get back into the vacation cycle
that they had enjoyed,"" said Rich Harrill, director of the
International Tourism Research Institute at the University of
South Carolina.
 ""Everybody checks exchange rates,"" he said. ""People are
going to continue to look at how much will they get for their
money and consider alternatives.""
 The U.S. Travel Association said European tourism to the
United States has never fully recovered since the Sept. 11,
2001, hijacked airliner attacks.
 ""The perception that the United States is not as welcoming
as it was pre-9/11 continues to drive visitors away,"" said the
association's Geoff Freeman, adding that Washington needed to
overhaul visa and entry processes.
 ""These visitors are walking stimulus packages,"" Freeman
said. ""They come, they spend their money, they go home, and
often with a better impression of the United States.""
 ROUGH CARIBBEAN SUMMER
 Canada appears to be faring a little better with the number
of Europeans visiting rising 6.4 percent for the first quarter
of 2010 compared to last year boosted by the Winter Olympics in
Vancouver in February.
 ""I don't think we're seeing any decline, but we just hosted
the Olympics so we're sort of the hot commodity,"" said Amber
Sessions, a manager of media relations at Tourism Vancouver.
 However, 16 of the 22 countries in the Caribbean Tourist
Organization saw a decline in European visitors between January
and April. Several suffered a double digit fall. European
overall arrivals fell 4.3 percent in the first half of 2010.
 ""This situation is not expected to ease up in the coming
summer as unemployment in these economies remains high and
consumer confidence is low,"" the group said. ""Those countries
heavily dependent on the European market are in for a bumpy
ride as in light of the current European economic realities.""
 In Mexico some hotel and restaurant owners in the beach
resort of Playa del Carmen, a few miles south of Cancun, were
also suffering from a lack of European visitors.
 ""European tourism has dipped significantly this year. There
are fewer Italians, Spaniards and Germans,"" said Cesar Navarro,
president of the local chapter of the National Restaurant
Chamber. Mexican tourists failed to make up the shortfall.
 ""There is national tourism now, but they generally spend 30
percent less than foreigners,"" he said.
 Spanish tourist Manuel Arroyo, 42, went ahead with a
vacation to Mexico with his wife and two children, but
complained about how expensive it was.
 ""It's more costly now,"" said Arroyo, a municipal employee.
""I have to spend more because the euro has devalued and the
European economy is in crisis, while it is improving in the
United States.""

 By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly
on Thursday, and the euro soared to a two-month high above
$1.29 as soft inflation and manufacturing data added to
concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy.
 U.S. producer prices declined for a third straight month,
the Labor Department reported. The data came just a day after
minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting revealed that
policy makers think they may need to do more to boost the
economy if a sputtering recovery slows any further.
 The news helped push the euro to its highest against the
dollar since May. The single currency, which slid below $1.19
in June on euro-zone debt trouble, has since risen by more than
8 percent after smooth government debt auctions in Greece,
Portugal and Spain eased concerns.
 Weak reports on New York and mid-Atlantic factory activity
also hurt the dollar, as did Wednesday's data showing retail
sales fell for a second straight month.
 The data ""is going to give traders further reason to dump
the dollar as the risk shifts from Europe to the United
States,"" said Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT Forex
in New York. ""Overall, U.S. fundamentals are making the U.S.
less attractive to investors.""
 The euro rose 1.3 percent to $1.2901, marking its best day
in two weeks. Traders said efforts to cover bets against the
euro that had built up in recent months have accelerated its
rise, as did demand for overnight euro call options with
strikes at $1.2825, $1.2835 and $1.2855.
 Positioning and technical considerations suggest ""a move
toward $1.30 is realistic,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of Europe
currency research at BTM/UFJ.
 The dollar also fell against other currencies, declining 1
percent to 87.53 yen and hitting a 5-1/2-month low against the
Swiss franc at 1.0401 francs. Sterling rose 0.7 percent to
$1.5374, just off a 10-week high.
 TREND SHIFT?
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six
major currencies, hit a two-month low and has now given back
more than a third of its rally since last November. It was
last down 1 percent at 82.585.
 Citing the weaker U.S. growth outlook, Goldman Sachs now
forecasts the euro to trade at $1.22 in three months' time
rather than $1.15, as it predicted in June. Its six- and
12-month forecasts are $1.35 and $1.38, respectively, compared
with $1.15 and $1.25 a month ago.
 But BNP Paribas strategist Sebastien Galy chalked the move
up to frenzied short-covering on the euro and said a flat U.S.
yield curve was encouraging Japanese investors to repatriate
profits, thus boosting the yen.
 ""On the yen, we may have a new trend developing with the
market heading toward the dollar at 85,"" he said.
 He expects the euro's gains to be capped, however, as the
threat of debt trouble in Europe and the fiscal austerity
budgets being adopted across the bloc will ensure sluggish
euro-zone growth.
 ""Sure, the euro could go to $1.31 in the short term because
speculators are aggressively short and any move up makes them
jumpy,"" Galy said. ""That's an appealing short-term trade and it
makes no sense to fight it. But when markets look again at
European fundamentals, we'll see a lower euro/dollar.""

 * Deals aims to cut tax losses from national treasuries

 By Andrea Swalec
 BRUSSELS, July 15 (Reuters) - The European Union and
cigarette producer British American Tobacco (BAT) have teamed up
to fight the booming trade in counterfeit and smuggled
cigarettes, the EU executive said on Thursday.
 BAT, whose global brands include Dunhill, Kent, Lucky Strike
and Pall Mall, will pay the executive European Commission and
participating national anti-fraud authorities $200 million over
20 years to fight illicit cigarette trade.
 Cigarette counterfeiting and smuggling deprives the EU's
national treasuries of an annual 10 billion euros in tax income,
the Commission estimates.
 ""This is money that could be put to good public use and that
is much needed, especially in the current economic climate,""
European Taxation and Customs Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said.
 Most counterfeit cigarettes sold in the EU are made in
China, Russia and Ukraine. One in five is produced on EU soil, a
Commission official said. Authentic, smuggled cigarettes mainly
enter the EU from Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.
 ""British American Tobacco sees illicit trade as a major
threat to legitimate tobacco companies,"" BAT director for
Western Europe Jack Bowles told reporters. One in eight
cigarettes sold in Europe has changed hands illegally, he said.
 Beyond economic concerns, counterfeit cigarettes pose a
public health risk, BAT representative Ross Marie said. 
 ""No one can ever be sure what goes into counterfeit
cigarettes, which are made in unregulated factories by criminals
with no regard for quality control.""
 BAT's funds will contribute to the bloc's efforts to train
customs and law enforcement officials to investigate illegal
tobacco, seize it and track it to its source.
 Poland, Spain and Sweden have not signed the agreement for
procedural reasons but are expected to join soon, Semeta said.
 The deal does not represent any change in the EU's smoking
prevention programmes, Semeta said.

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - World stocks dropped on
Thursday and the dollar declined broadly after downbeat U.S.
manufacturing and inflation data deepened worries that a
double-dip recession could be at hand.
 The rate of growth in the factory sector slowed sharply in
July and U.S. wholesale prices fell for a third straight month,
adding to evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is losing
steam.
 The decline in U.S. producer prices appeared to raise the
prospect of a deflationary spiral of lower prices, wages and
business activity.
 Financial markets all week have battled conflicting signals
from data showing a slowdown in the U.S. economy's recovery on
the one hand and strong corporate earnings on the other hand.
 U.S. Treasuries prices rose as the data raised the
possibility that the Federal Reserve could turn to a second
round of extraordinary measures to stimulate the economy.
 ""Death, destruction, story at six. Come on, what more do we
need to know here? Double-dip is here, there is no doubt about
it,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading
in Chatham, New Jersey.
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reported that factory
activity growth in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region fell, with its
business activity index dropping to 5.1 in July from 8.0 in
June.
 The New York Federal Reserve Bank said manufacturing in new
York State hit the lowest level since December 2009, while U.S.
producer prices fell 0.5 percent last month.
 The negative data overshadowed an unexpectedly large drop
in first-time claims for jobless benefits last week, with
claiming falling 29,000 to a two-year low of 429,000 as
seasonal layoffs at factories eased. For details, see
[ID:nN15204522] and [ID:nN15208925]
 Major equity indexes were down on the largely negative
economic figures. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 102.02 points, or 0.98 percent, at 10,264.70. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 11.24 points, or 1.03
percent, at 1,083.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was
down 20.92 points, or 0.93 percent, at 2,228.92.
 Dow component JPMorgan Chase fell 1.5 percent to $39.75,
even as second-quarter profit topped estimates and its loan
loss reserves dropped by $1.5 billion. Much of the gains came
in areas that will not be a stable future source of income.
[ID:nN13247761]
 Bank stocks fell as investors fretted about JPMorgan's
sober assessment of the economy, boding poorly for Citigroup
Inc  and Bank of America Corp  which report
earnings on Friday.
 Citi shares were off 3.1 percent at $4.08 and Bank of
America fell 3.6 percent to $15.11.
last week ""JPMorgan's numbers were good, but they did it by
cutting expenses, not through top-line revenue growth,"" said
John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global in Chicago. ""In
the longer term, that's troubling.""
 MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> moved in sympathy
with the U.S. market's open, dropping 0.66 percent. The Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> was also down 0.70
percent.
 European shares moved in sympathy with U.S. markets. The
pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top shares
closed 1.1 percent lower at 1,033.562 points, the biggest
one-day percentage fall since July 1.
 In currencies, the dollar was down against a basket of
major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index
<.DXY> down 0.88 percent at 82.689 from a previous session
close of 83.426.
 The euro  soared to a two-month high above $1.29.
 It was up 1.04 percent at $1.2872 from a previous session
close of $1.2740. Debt trouble in the euro zone had pushed it
below $1.19 last month, but fairly smooth bond auctions in
Greece, Portugal and Spain have since eased concern.
 The data ""is going to give traders further reason to dump
the dollar as the risk shifts from Europe to the United
States,"" said Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT Forex
in New York.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 1.18
percent at 87.40 from a previous session close of 88.440.
 CHINA STOCKS FALL AFTER DEBUT
 China's key stock index ended 1.9 percent lower, its
biggest fall in two weeks, as Agricultural Bank of China
disappointed with a lackluster Shanghai debut. AgBank, the most
active stock, ended up 0.8 percent at 2.7 yuan compared with
its IPO price of 2.68 yuan.
 Earlier data showed China's economic growth moderated to
10.3 percent in the second quarter from 11.9 percent in the
first quarter, slightly below forecasts of 10.5 percent
growth.
 All told, Treasuries were one of the biggest beneficiaries
on Thursday. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note
 was up 20/32, with the yield at 2.98 percent. The
2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 1/32, with the
yield at 0.59 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond
 was up 39/32, with the yield at 3.97 percent.
U.S. light sweet crude oil  fell $1.36, or 1.77
percent, to $75.68 per barrel, and spot gold prices  rose
slightly by 90 cents, or 0.07 percent, to $1,208.40. But the
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB> was up 0.54 point, or 0.21
percent, at 262.74.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly
on Thursday, with the euro soaring to a two-month high above
$1.29 as soft inflation and manufacturing data added to concern
about the strength of the U.S. economy.
 Data showing a third straight monthly decline in producer
prices came a day after Federal Reserve meeting minutes
revealed policymakers think they may need to do more to boost
the economy if a sputtering recovery slows any further.
 That helped push the euro to its highest against the dollar
since May. The single currency, which slid below $1.19 in June
on euro-zone debt trouble, has risen by more than 8 percent
after smooth debt auctions in Greece, Portugal and Spain eased
concerns.
 Weak reports on New York and mid-Atlantic factory activity
also hurt the dollar, as did Wednesday's data showing retail
sales fell for a second straight month. For details, see.
 The data ""is going to give traders further reason to dump
the dollar as the risk shifts from Europe to the United
States,"" said Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT Forex
in New York. ""Overall, U.S. fundamentals are making the U.S.
less attractive to investors.""
 The euro rose 1.4 percent to $1.2917 for its best day in
two weeks. Traders said efforts to cover bets against the euro
that had built up in recent months have accelerated its rise,
as did demand for overnight euro call options with strikes at
$1.2825, $1.2835 and $1.2855.
 Positioning and technical considerations suggest ""a move
toward $1.30 is realistic,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of Europe
currency research at BTM/UFJ.
 The dollar also fell 1.2 percent to 87.46 yen and hit a
5-1/2=month low at 1.0402 Swiss francs. Sterling rose 0.7
percent to $1.5366, just off a 10-week high.
 TREND SHIFT OR SIMPLE SHORT SQUEEZE?
 The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six
major currencies, hit a two-month low and has now given back
more than a third of its rally since last November.
 Citing the weaker U.S. growth outlook, Goldman Sachs now
forecasts the euro to trade at $1.22 in three months' time
rather than $1.15, as it predicted in June. Its six- and
12-month forecasts are $1.35 and $1.38, respectively, compared
to $1.15 and $1.25 a month ago.
 But BNP Paribas strategist Sebastien Galy instead chalked
the move up to frenzied short-covering on the euro and said a
flat U.S. yield curve was encouraging Japanese investors to
repatriate profits, thus boosting the yen.
 ""On the yen, we may have a new trend developing with the
market heading toward the dollar at 85,"" he said.
 But he said the threat of debt trouble in Europe and the
fiscal austerity budgets being adopted across the bloc will
ensure sluggish euro-zone growth, keeping euro gains capped.
 ""Soon someone is going to realize it's nonsensical to have
a higher euro at a time when European governments are
deflating,"" Galy said. ""Sure, the euro could go to $1.31 in the
short term because speculators are aggressively short and any
move up makes them jumpy. That's an appealing short-term trade
and it makes no sense to fight it, but when markets look again
at European fundamentals, we'll see a lower euro/dollar.""

LONDON)
 By Jennifer Ablan and Natsuko Waki
 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - World stocks dropped
on Thursday as disappointing U.S. economic data overshadowed
strong earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. , while the
dollar extended losses, shedding 1 percent against the yen.
 Among the weak reports, U.S. industrial production eked out
a small gain in June and producer prices fell for a third
month, providing more evidence of sluggish economic growth.
 Growth in factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region
fell sharply. Economists had expected a rise.
 Investors have been faced all week with strong earnings but
data showing the recovery losing steam, which revived fears the
economy could tip into a double-dip recession.
 ""Death, destruction, story at six. Come on, what more do we
need to know here? Double-dip is here, there is no doubt about
it,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading
in Chatham, New Jersey.
 Other data showed slowing growth in New York-area
manufacturing activity. But new U.S. weekly claims for jobless
benefits fell to their lowest level in nearly two years.
 Major equity indexes were down on the largely negative
economic figures. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was
down 108.75 points, or 1.05 percent, at 10,257.97. The Standard
& Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down 11.89 points, or 1.09
percent, at 1,083.28, while the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
was down 25.35 points, or 1.13 percent, at 2,224.50.
 MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> moved in sympathy
with the U.S. market's open, dropping 2.11 percent. The Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> was also down 0.78
percent.
 Strong earnings from JPMorgan Chase, the second-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, weren't enough to offset the economic
data. JPMorgan's earnings jumped to $4.8 billion from $2.7
billion as loan loss reserves declined, setting the bar high
for other big banks soon to produce results.
 In currencies, the dollar was down against a basket of
major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index
<.DXY> down 1 percent at 82.55 from a previous session close of
83.426.
 The dollar hit a two-month low against the euro  and
a basket of major currencies moved in sympathy with U.S.
equities on soft inflation and manufacturing data.
 Figures showing a third straight monthly decline in
producer prices came a day after minutes from a Federal Reserve
policy meeting showed some policymakers think they may need to
do more to boost the economy if a sputtering recovery slows any
further.
 That helped the euro rally to just shy of $1.29 for the
first time since May. Debt trouble in the euro zone had pushed
it below $1.19 last month, but fairly smooth bond auctions in
Greece, Portugal and Spain have since eased concern.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 1.29

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, July 15 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slipped
close to one-week low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday as
weak U.S. data renewed concerns about the strength of the
economic recovery.
 Sentiment turned sour after a gauge of factory activity in
New York state fell sharply, while first-time applications for
U.S. jobless benefits edged down. [ID:nN15208925]
 The currency fell further to its weakest level since July 9
after a lower than expected reading in the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia's index of business conditions in the U.S.
Mid-Atlantic region for July. [ID:nEAH104F00]
 At 10:50 a.m. (1450 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was
at C$1.0421 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.96 U.S. cents, down
sharply from Wednesday's close at C$1.0341 to the U.S. dollar,
or 96.70 U.S. cents.
 ""It's a reversion back to more longer-term fundamentals and
based on the weakening sentiment with respect to U.S.
economics,"" said Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign
exchange at National Bank Financial.
 ""Money is flying out of the States and back into euro, away
from commodities and away from commodity-related currencies.""
 The data came the day after minutes from a U.S. Federal
Reserve meeting showed policymakers felt they should stand
ready to do more to boost the economy if the outlook worsens
for Canada's largest trading partner.
 The data also helped wipe out early gains the currency made
on the back of positive investor sentiment after JPMorgan's
second-quarter profit beat expectations and fed into firmer
equity markets.
 The soft data also weighed on commodity prices, notably the
price of oil, which dropped below $76 a barrel. Canada is the
No. 1 exporter of oil to the United States. [O/R]
 The swing lower may not last too long but could see the
currency hit C$1.05 to the U.S. dollar, said John Curran,
senior vice-president at CanadianForex, who said knee-jerk reactions tend to get overdone.
 ""While it's concerning that these numbers are poor, I don't
think these huge swings are necessarily going to last,"" he
said, citing generally positive Canadian data.
 BONDS CRUISE HIGHER
 Canadian government bond prices followed their U.S.
counterparts higher on Thursday morning after the weak data put
the relatively safety of government debt back in the
spotlight.
 Market players largely shrugged aside Canadian
manufacturing sales for May, which rose by 0.4 percent from
April and at twice the rate expected. [ID:nN15195040]
 The next key Canadian-driven event for the market will be
the Bank of Canada's interest rate announcement on July 20, and
market expectations are leaning toward a rate increase.
 Canadian primary dealers and global forecasters surveyed by
Reuters expect the bank will raise its key overnight interest
rate next week by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent, though the
pace of subsequent hikes is less clear. [CA/POLL]
 The two-year bond  was up 8 Canadian cents to
yield 1.674 percent, while the 10-year bond 
increased 28 Canadian cents to yield 3.231 percent.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a two-month
low against the euro and a basket of major currencies on
Thursday after soft inflation and manufacturing data sparked
concern about the strength of the U.S. economy.
 Data showing a third straight monthly decline in producer
prices came a day after Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed
policymakers think they may need to do more to boost the
economy if a sputtering recovery slows any further.
 That helped drive the euro above $1.28 for the first time
since early May. Worries about sovereign debt in the 16-country
euro zone had pushed it below $1.19 in June.
 A gauge of factory activity in New York state also fell
sharply, while first-time applications for U.S. jobless
benefits fell slightly.
 The data ""is going to give traders further reason to dump
the dollar as the risk shifts from Europe to the United
States,"" said Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT Forex
in New York. ""Overall, U.S. fundamentals are making the U.S.
less attractive to investors.""
 The euro rose 1 percent on the day to $1.2877, its highest
level since early May, while the dollar fell 0.8 percent to
87.71 yen. The dollar also hit a three-month low at 1.0452
Swiss francs while sterling rose to a 2-1/2-month peak of
$1.5371.
 Traders said strong demand for overnight euro/dollar call
options with strikes at $1.2825, $1.2835 and $1.2855 had
facilitated a rally in the euro.
 Citing the weaker U.S. growth outlook, Goldman Sachs now
forecasts the euro to trade at $1.22 in three months' time
rather than $1.15, as it predicted in June. It's six- and
12-month forecasts are $1.35 and $1.38, respectively, compared
to $1.15 and $1.25 a month ago.
 TECHNICALS SUGGEST DOLLAR TROUBLE
 Better-than-expected quarterly profits from JPMorgan Chase
& Co also boosted risk appetite and higher-yielding currencies
such as the Australian dollar.
 That contrasted with soft economic data, which hurts the
dollar because investors fear it hints the economy may take a
turn for the worse in the second half of 2010.
 ""Over the near term, the dollar is likely to continue to
struggle if data continues to come out towards the weaker end
of expectations. That would tend to add to the dollar's heavier
tone,"" said Joe Manimbo, analyst at Travelex Global Business
Payments in Washington.
 Strategists said technical indicators were flashing a
breakdown of the dollar's recent trend higher. The dollar
index, which measures the greenback against six major
currencies, hit a two-month low and passed the 38.2 percent
retracement of an trend up that began in November and peaked in
early June.
 Technical analysts also highlighted the euro's break above
the $1.2785 mark for the first time since December 2009. They
said a close above that level was key to further gains.
 ""A move towards $1.30 is realistic for the euro, but we
don't see it lasting. If U.S. data continues to deteriorate, it
won't be long before that's being replicated elsewhere,"" said
Derek Halpenny, European head of currency research at BTM/UFJ.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a two-month
low against the euro and a basket of currencies on Thursday
after dovish U.S. Federal Reserve minutes heightened concerns
about the outlook for the U.S. economy.
 Fed officials last month felt they should be ready to
consider additional steps to boost the U.S. economy if an
already softening outlook took a noticeable turn for the worse.

 ""The Fed minutes were particularly dovish, with the
discussion about the possibility of easing measures providing a
soft underbelly for the dollar,"" said Chris Turner, currency
strategist at ING.
 The Fed also trimmed forecasts for growth this year. A
string of U.S. data is due out on Thursday, including industrial
output and weekly jobless claims and any weakness could trigger
more dollar selling, analysts said.
 The minutes showed about half of U.S. policymakers saw
growth risks to the downside, with some worried about the
prospect of a deflationary spiral.
 At 1125 GMT, the euro was up 0.6 percent at $1.2815. It was
given an added boost after better-than-expected JPMorgan
earnings fuelled demand for perceived riskier assets, pushing
the single currency to session highs of $1.2834. Euro
sentiment was helped by Spain selling nearly 3 billion euros of
bonds in an auction which traders said met with solid demand,
providing reassurance about the debt-laden country's ability to
raise cash.
 Traders said strong demand for overnight euro/dollar call
options with strikes at $1.2825, $1.2835 and $1.2855 had
facilitated a rally in the euro.
 Technical analysts highlighted the break above the daily
Ichimoku cloud at $1.2785 for the first time since December
2009. They said a close above that level was key to further
gains, while the 2007 lows at $1.2868 were next resistance.
 ""A move towards $1.30 is realistic for the euro, but we
don't see it lasting. If U.S. data continues to deteriorate, it
won't be long before that's being replicated elsewhere,"" said
Derek Halpenny, European head of currency research at BTM/UFJ.
 The U.S. Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that U.S.
retailers' June sales declined 0.5 percent -- more than twice
the 0.2 percent drop forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
 A raft of U.S. data is set for release later, with producer
prices, weekly jobless claims and the empire manufacturing
survey all due.
 The dollar index was down 0.6 percent at 82.947, having hit
a two-month low of 82.854. It fell through support at around
83.15, a 38.2 percent retracement of its rise from a low of
74.17 in November 2009 to a high of 88.59 on June 8.
 The dollar also hit a one-week low against the yen around
87.86 yen.
 Traders said charts looked bearish after the greenback
failed the previous day to rise above 89.23 yen -- a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of the dollar's fall from its June
high just below 93 yen to a July 1 low of 86.96 yen.

 GENEVA, July 15 (Reuters) - Demand for first and business
class tickets rebounded strongly in May, rising nearly a fifth
year-on-year, after stagnating in April because of European
airspace closures, air industry association IATA said.
 In the first five months of the year, premium travel has
grown by 10.8 percent compared with the 2009 period as business
confidence and world trade recover, IATA said on Thursday.
 In May premium travel was 18.7 percent higher than a year
earlier, compared with a 10.2 percent rise in economy class
travel and growth of only 1.1 percent in premium travel in
April, the International Air Transport Association IATA said in
its monthly assessment of premium travel.
 Consumer confidence is improving but at a slower rate than
business confidence and leisure travel is lagging the recovery,
IATA said.
 Routes linked to Asia and the North and Mid Pacific showed
growth rates of 20 percent or more while routes linked to the
Middle East now represent more than 10 percent of international
premium travellers.
 The North Atlantic market remains fairly sluggish, with
premium traffic rising 7.8 percent in May.
 Routes within Europe saw growth in premium traffic jumping
to 23 percent in May, reflecting an increase in long-haul
passengers connecting through major European hubs.
 IATA, whose 230 members include Lufthansa, Gulf and
Singapore Airlines, said last month it expected the air industry
to return to profit this year.

 * Cabinet rejects Slovak 800 million euro loan to Greece
 * European Commission welcomes Slovak decision
 
 (Adds signing, European Commission comment)
 By Martin Santa
 BRATISLAVA, July 15 (Reuters) - Slovakia cleared the way on
Thursday to the launch of a European safety net for governments
that end up in a debt trap, yielding to pressure from European
partners to put aside opposition to the plan.
 The euro zone's poorest member, led by the new centre-right
cabinet of Prime Minister Iveta Radicova, had been holding up
the 750-billion euro European Financial Stability Facility
(EFSF) after objections to bailouts became a campaign issue in
Slovakia's June election.
 But the government approved the plan on Thursday and Finance
Minister Ivan Miklos promptly signed a framework agreement on
the fund, removing the last big obstacle in its way.
 The European Commission welcomed Bratislava's decision and
added that dialogue with Slovakia would continue.
 The previous leftist government of Robert Fico, which
stepped down last Thursday, had endorsed the aid mechanism. But
any financial assistance to richer EU states is deeply unpopular
in Slovakia, a euro zone member only since January 2009.
 ""We want to set an example of following the rules of the
game. Because of this, the government has supported the
political declaration given by the previous government in May,""
Radicova told reporters to explain what swayed the cabinet.
 Pressure on Bratislava to unblock the EFSF rose in past
weeks since the fund is a crucial part of the 27-member European
bloc's efforts to restore confidence in financial markets after
the Greek debt crisis.
 The Slovak cabinet recommended parliament support the safety
net scheme but also agreed it would demand creation of stricter
fiscal rules in the euro zone, including a mechanism for
bankruptcy for countries with irresponsible fiscal policies,
before any aid from the fund is released.
 Temporary financial support to troubled countries will have
to be in line with the International Monetary Fund's policies
and conditions, the government said.
 Miklos, a fiscal hawk charged with slashing Slovakia's
burdensome fiscal deficit, introducing further market reforms
and reinvigorating the domestic economy, said he expected the
parliament to debate the Slovak role in EFSF in coming weeks.
 Slovakia's share in the overall 750 billion euro ($961
billion) plan is 4.5 billion euros worth of guarantees.
 The country of 5.4 million adopted the single currency only
in January last year and its public is angry that they have been
asked to help bail out Greece, a much better off country.
 
 GREEK LOAN HITS A SNAG
 Consequently, Radicova's cabinet did not budge on a separate
promise made to voters that it would not back aid for debt-laden
Athens, agreed by European countries separately from the EFSF.
 The cabinet recommended that parliament not approve an 800
million euro ($1.02 billion) bilateral loan to Greece, which
would be the Slovak contribution to the 110 billion euro EU
bail-out package.
 ""The Greek loan is about irresponsible government policies,
irresponsible behaviour of the banking sector, rating agencies,
but also of the Eurostat and malfunctioning of other
institutions,"" Radicova said.
 ""I'm against the loan, we are the euro zone's poorest
country and this is ridiculous. Greece had been living above its
means,"" said Silvia Habova, 27, an account manager.
 The minimum wage in Slovakia, a former communist country, is
308 euros, well below the Greek minimum legal wage of 863 euros.

Thursday won a confidence vote in the Senate over its 25 billion
euro austerity package aimed at lowering the budget deficit to
2.7 percent of GDP in 2012 from 5.3 percent last year.
 The vote was held on a so-called ""maxi-amendment"" to the
package, presented by the government, which incorporated a
series of relatively minor changes introduced by parliament
since the bill was presented at the end of May.
 The budget passes to the floor of the Chamber of Deputies
for a second discussion on July 26 and must be finally approved
by July 29 before parliament's summer recess. However, after
Thursday's Senate vote the measures cannot be amended further.
 
 Here are some key measures of the latest and final version
of the plan.

 SPENDING CUTS
 * Cuts in funding to city and regional governments worth 13
billion euros between 2011 and 2013 (6.3 bln euros in 2011, 8.5
bln in 2012 and 8.5 bln in 2013).
 * 10 percent cut per year in 2011, 2012 and 2013 in spending
by all government ministries. The savings will be 6.4 bln euros
in 2011, 8.5 bln in 2012 and 8.5 bln in 2013.
 * Four-year freeze (2010-2013) on public sector pay rises,
excluding teachers, the police and the armed services.
 * Cuts for three years in public sector hiring, replacing
only one employee for every five who leave. 
 * Progressive pay cuts of up to 10 percent for high earners
in the public sector, including ministers and parliamentarians.
 * Delays of three months or six months in retirement for
those who reach retirement age from 2011. This will bring
savings of 360 million euros in 2011, 2.6 bln in 2012 and 3.5
bln in 2013.
 * Indexing of retirement age to average national life
expectancy from 2015, on the basis of reports produced every
three years by national statistics institute ISTAT. 
 * From 2012 the minimum retirement age for women in the
public sector will rise to 65 from 60. This will bring it into
line with the retirement age of their male colleagues as
requested by the European Union.
 * Elimination of 27 publicly funded institutions, including
ISAE, which conducts Italy's consumer and business confidence
surveys. ISAE's tasks will pass to the economy ministry.
 
 REVENUE-RAISING 
 * Partial amnesty for people with houses they have not
declared to the authorities. There are an estimated 1.3 million
such houses.
 * A crackdown on tax evasion and false benefit claims,
including:
 -- 100,000 checks per year in 2010, rising to 250,000 in
2011 and 2012 on claims for invalidity pensions.
 -- A ban on cash payments for sums above 5,000 euros,
lowering the ceiling from a previous level of 12,500 euros.
 -- Computerised invoices are to be obligatory for all
payments of more than 3,000 euros.
 The measures against tax evasion are intended to garner more
than 30 percent of the entire 25 bln euro package.
 * Tightening tax on stock options and bonuses, in line with
G20 guidelines. 
 
 INCENTIVES FOR COMPETITIVENESS 
 * Measures intended to link salary increases to rises in
productivity, in a bid to eliminate Italy's widening
competitiveness gap with major EU partners.
 * Drastic reduction of procedures necessary to set up new
businesses.
 * A series of measures aimed at reducing red tape to make it
easier to do business in Italy.
 Allowing foreign companies investing in Italy to apply the
tax regime of their home country. 
 
 WHEN WILL THE MEASURES TAKE EFFECT? 
 The vast majority will take effect in 2011. A few will be
brought forward to 2010. 
 
 WHAT ARE ITALY'S MOST RECENT ECONOMIC FORECASTS? 
Following are the government's multi-year targets issued on
May 6. Previous forecasts, issued in January, are in brackets. 
 2010 2011 2012
GDP 1.0% (1.1%) 1.5% (2.0%) 2.0% (2.0%)
DEFICIT/GDP 5.0% (5.0%) 3.9% (3.9%) 2.7% (2.7%)
DEBT/GDP 118.4% (116.9%) 118.7% (116.5%) 117.2%(114.6%)
PRIMARY BALANCE* -0.4% (-0.1%) 1.0% (1.3%) 2.5% (2.7%)
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 8.7% (8.4%) na (8.3%) 8.2% (8.0%)
TAX/GDP RATIO 42.8% 42.4% 42.3% 
 *excludes debt servicing costs 
 
 HOW URGENT IS DEFICIT REDUCTION FOR ITALY? 
 Italy has been spared the worst of the market volatility
since Greece's debt crisis exploded, thanks mainly to the
cautious fiscal policy of Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti,
meaning it is now under less pressure to adopt draconian cuts. 
Italy shunned large-scale stimulus during the recession of
2008 and 2009 and its deficit, at a projected 5 percent of GDP
in 2010, rose far less than in Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland
or Britain, which are all in or close to double digits. 
However Italy remains vulnerable due to its massive public
debt worth around 118 percent of GDP. Markets and ratings
agencies want evidence that recent rises in the debt can be
reversed through structural deficit cuts and pro-growth
policies.

 * Germany's Siemens signs multi-billion euro deals

(Writes through with Merkel, fresh quotes, details) 
 By Alexei Anishchuk and Andreas Rinke
 YEKATERINBURG, Russia, July 15 (Reuters) - Russia and
Germany pledged to strengthen economic ties on Thursday as
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called Europe's largest
economy Moscow's ""key partner"" for the future.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said relations between the
two states had taken a stride forward as she led a delegation of
business leaders on a tour of Russia, China and Kazakhstan.
 ""Germany is our key strategic partner,"" Medvedev said after
meeting Merkel in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, urging
Germany to invest in Russia and help modernise its economy.
 The Russian leader has called for warmer relations with the
West as he seeks to diversify the Russian economy after the
global economic crisis underlined its dependence on exports of
energy and commodities.
 Business deals signed during Merkel's visit included an
agreement worth 2.2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) for German
engineering conglomerate Siemens to supply trains to Russian
Railways.
 According to Russia's Customs Service, Germany was Russia's
biggest trading partner in 2009, just ahead of the Netherlands,
with China in third place. The European Union accounted for over
half of Russian trade last year, and the U.S. just 3.9 percent.
 However, Germany's exports to Russia have fallen sharply in
the economic crisis, prompting German business lobbies to
criticise the pace of Russian economic reform.
 Merkel, who initially adopted a more reserved attitude to
Russia than her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder when she took
office in 2005, has increasingly warmed to Moscow, meeting
Medvedev for the second time in just a few weeks.
 ""Relations between both countries are more intensive than
they have been for a long time,"" Merkel said, adding that it was
vital the pair stepped up economic cooperation.
 ""We talked about how it would be good to have a few shining
beacons out there to demonstrate that (economic) relations are
not a one way street,"" the chancellor said.
 
 LUCRATIVE DEALS
 Merkel's trip gave her an escape from a run of negative
political developments at home, and a chance to trumpet the
German economy's recovery from a record slump in 2009.
 Among the industry leaders travelling on her delegation were
the bosses of Siemens, carmaker Volkswagen, planemaker Airbus,
chemicals group BASF, retailer Metro and lender Commerzbank.
 On top of its contract to supply trains, Siemens also
secured a 1 billion euro renewable energy joint venture with
Russian wind power companies Rosteknologii and Rusgrido.
 EADS unit Airbus won an order worth more than 2 billion
euros to deliver A330 planes to Russia's Aeroflot, a source
familiar with the deal said.
 And Gazprom Bank will take a 30 percent stake in
Russian-German energy agency Rudea. The bank, which has stakes
in some 500 Russian firms, will fund energy efficiency projects,
such as plans to update street lighting across the country. 
 Siemens has partnered with RZhD (Russian Railways), Russian
power generators and medical groups for years, earning billions
of dollars from RZhD alone.
 It supplied RZhD with eight trains for its fledgling high
speed link between Moscow and St Petersburg last year, and
signed a 30-year maintenance contract for 630 million euros.
 Siemens was embroiled in a bribery scandal in Russia in
recent years, but this has not harmed its dealings there.
 The group will also build a research centre at Skolkovo -- a
technology hub set up by Medvedev to mimic the United States'
Silicon Valley.

 LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - World stocks ticked higher on
Thursday, erasing early losses, while the euro hit a two-month

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 15 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell on
Thursday, as selling by model-based funds weighed on the currency
against the yen, while it took in stride data that pointed to a
mild slowdown in China, rather than a deeper one as some had
feared.
 The Australian dollar slid in early Asian trade after the
China Securities Journal reported the economy may lose momentum
more than expected later this year.
 It temporarily pared losses following the release of Chinese
official data but soon started to ease again on the selling by
model-based funds, traders said.
 ""The data has attracted much attention but at the end of the
day it wasn't far from market expectations. It showed the Chinese
economy is slowing down, but that's what markets have been
looking for,"" said Hideaki Inoue, manager of foreign exchange at
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.
 The Australian dollar stood at $0.8772, down 0.7 percent on
the day. It hit a two-month high of $0.8871 on Wednesday.
 It also dropped 1 percent to 77.28 yen.
 The euro erased its losses to change hands at $1.2722, not
far from its two-month high of $1.2778 hit on Wednesday as
traders bought back the currency. Long dogged by worries over
euro zone debt problems the euro tends to benefit from rising
risk appetite.
 China's economic growth slowed to 10.3 percent in the second
quarter from 11.9 percent in the first quarter in response to the
fading effect of government fiscal and monetary stimulus as well
as a high base of comparison a year earlier.
 With Chinese data out of the way, the market's focus is
likely to shift back to the strength of the U.S. economy, traders
said.
 Investors will look to a raft of U.S. data due later in the
day, including industrial output, jobless claims and regional
business activity, for clues to the health of the world's biggest
economy.
 ""U.S. data will be a very important market-moving factor
today, especially after the minutes from the Federal Reserve's
last meeting fanned speculation of further policy easing,"" said
Hideki Hayashi, a global economist at Mizuho Securities.
 Fed officials slightly revised down their outlook for
economic growth in the second half of the year, while minutes
from the central bank's June 22-23 meeting said the officials
would need to consider whether ""further policy stimulus might
become appropriate if the outlook were to worsen appreciably"".
 The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that U.S.
retailers' June sales declined 0.5 percent -- more than twice the
0.2 percent drop forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
 That sapped some of the optimism triggered by strong U.S.
corporate earnings being released this week, leaving the U.S.
dollar near a two-month low on a basket of currencies.
 The dollar index stood at 83.344, down 0.1 percent on the day
and not far from a two-month low of 83.205 hit on Wednesday.
 The index is holding just above support at around 83.15, a
38.2 percent retracement of its rise from a low of 74.17 in
November 2009 to a high of 88.59 on June 8.
 Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.3 percent to 88.13 yen.
 Charts looked increasingly bearish for the dollar after the
greenback failed the previous day to rise above 89.23 yen -- a
38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the dollar's fall from its
June high of 92.68 yen to a July 1 low of 86.96 yen, traders
said.
 The Bank of Japan said on Thursday it expected the economy to
grow at its fastest pace in a decade in the year to March 2011,
but said the euro zone debt crisis could pose a risk to the
outlook.
 The central bank kept interest rates unchanged at 0.1
percent, as widely expected.
 Sterling was little moved on the day at $1.5266, staying near
a 10-week high of $1.5298 hit the previous day.
Better-than-expected British employment data released on
Wednesday added to speculation that the Bank of England may have
to start considering raising interest rates.

 YEKATERINBURG, Russia, July 15 (Reuters) - Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday told German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, in Russia to promote trade, that he was relying on
German investment to boost his plans to modernise the economy.
 The Russian leader has called for warmer ties with the West
and said trade with the European Union and the United States
could shape the alliances needed for his plan to re-brand Russia
after the crisis revealed the weakness of its economic model.
 ""We are counting on German structures taking part in the

counterpart.
 According to Russia's Customs Service, Germany and the
Netherlands were its biggest trading partners last year, closely
followed by China. 
 Merkel, who has endured a torrid few months at home, is
travelling with a delegation of top German business leaders in
Russia, Kazakhstan and China, aiming to sign a series of
lucrative deals.
 Merkel's delegation includes the bosses of carmaker
Volkswagen, industrial conglomerate Siemens, planemaker Airbus,

 Siemens is expected to sign a major joint venture to
build a wind turbine manufacturing facility in Russia, as well
as an order to supply 240 trains to Russian Railways.

relationship with the United States is not ""living up to its

reform and the economic crisis, the EU's most senior figure the
said in a newspaper interview published on Thursday.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told the

Europe.
 ""The transatlantic relationship is not living up to its
potential. I think we should do much more together. We have
conditions like we have never had before and it would be a pity
if we missed the opportunity,"" he said.
 Barroso also said the single currency had acted like a
""sleeping pill"", lulling some countries into a false sense of
economic confidence and the ""illusion of prosperity"", allowing
governments to avoid painful economic reforms.
 However, since the financial crisis, the single currency had
also forced euro zone members to get their economies back into
shape through tough austerity measures, he said.
 ""The euro is, in fact, being an extremely powerful driver
for what Europe needs - and what Europe needs most of all is not
to live above its means and, secondly, to make the structural
reforms to become more competitive in the global economies,"" he
said.
 Barroso said the EU must cooperate more closely on economic
policies but stressed this would not lead to a further
centralisation of powers for Brussels.
 ""We need to do more for an economic union in Europe,"" he
said. ""...This means to act together when it makes sense. It
makes sense for even the biggest states in the EU, because when

 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, July 15 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar tumbled on
Thursday after an official Chinese paper reported the country's
economy may slow more sharply than expected in the second half of
this year, urging Beijing not to tighten its policy further.
 The report, a few hours before the official announcement of a
set of Chinese economic data, prompted selling in high-yielding
currencies, such as the Australian dollar, against the Japanese
yen.
 The spectre of slower growth in China rekindled worries that
have beset financial markets since last month that the global
economy may be losing an engine at the same time as much of the
developed world is reducing fiscal stimulus.
 ""A lot of the data I am looking at - things like real time
port activity - has slowed materially and this should show up in
industrial production today,"" Robert Rennie, chief currency
strategist at Westpac in Sydney wrote on the Reuters Dealing
Room.
 ""I find it hard to believe that the Australian dollar should
be doing well with very real signs of rising concern on U.S. data
plus Chinese softening.""
 The U.S. Commerce Department reported that U.S. retailers'
June sales declined 0.5 percent -- more than twice the 0.2
percent drop forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
 That has sapped some of the optimism triggered by strong U.S.
corporate earnings being released this week, leaving the U.S.
dollar near its two-month low on a basket of currencies.
 The dollar index stood at 83.48, not far from a two-month low
of 83.205 hit on Wednesday following weak U.S. retail sales
numbers for June and dovish Federal Reserve minutes from its last

 The index is holding just above support at around 83.15, the
38.2 percent retracement of the its rise from a low of 74.17 in

 The Australian dollar fell about 0.4 percent to $0.8795,
slipping further from a two-month high of $0.8871 hit on
Wednesday. Against the yen, it shed 0.8 percent to 77.51 yen.
 The U.S. dollar eased about 0.3 percent against the yen to
88.14 yen, having slid 0.5 percent on Wednesday.
 Traders said if the Chinese data came in weaker than
expected, it could spark fresh demand for the Japanese currency
and the yen could rise above the 88 per dollar level.
 The yen usually gains when there is a spike in risk aversion
and fears of a global slowdown drives investors to safe-haven
assets.
 A slew of Chinese data, including consumer inflation for the
year to June, industrial product numbers, retail sales,
investment data for June and second-quarter gross domestic
product is due at 0200 GMT.
 Any hint of a slowdown in China could see profit-taking in
growth-linked currencies like the Australian and the New Zealand
dollars, though some traders said bad news may have already been
factored in.
 ""I think the market has already priced in weak readings after
all the market's moves this morning, so additional reaction may
be limited,"" said a trader at a Japanese bank.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.2720, off a high of
$1.2778 struck on Wednesday, its highest since early May. The
single currency pared some of its gains, although sentiment was
holding up given recent successful bond auctions in Portugal,
Germany and Greece.

(Adds analyst quote, graphics link, details)
 By Leika Kihara
 TOKYO, July 15 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to
revise up its economic forecast for the current fiscal year on
Thursday, but stick to its cautious view on an outlook clouded by
grinding deflation and anxiety over Europe's debt woes.
 The nine-member board may debate how the policy stalemate
created by the ruling party's defeat in upper house elections on
Sunday could affect the outlook for the economy.
 Some analysts say the government, its hands tied on fiscal
policy, may lean on the BOJ if sharp gains in the yen threaten a
fragile recovery.
 But with little sign of that happening now, the central bank
is expected to keep interest rates at 0.1 percent and hold off on
new policy initiatives.
 ""With the political situation still murky, the BOJ will take
a wait-and-see stance for now,"" said Hirokata Kusaba, a senior
economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
 ""Government pressure for further monetary easing may escalate
in the autumn, when economic growth begins to slow. With room for
fiscal stimulus limited, politicians will begin to focus on what
more monetary policy can do.""
 With solid exports to Asia offsetting slack U.S. and European
demand, the BOJ will probably stick to its projection of a
moderate recovery in Japan. It is expected to forecast growth of
around 2.5 percent in the fiscal year ending next March, up from
its April estimate of 1.8 percent.
 The BOJ is unlikely to make substantial changes to its
forecast that Japan will remain in deflation this fiscal year and
see only slightly positive consumer price growth in the following
year ending in March 2012.
 Deflation has been at the heart of the Japanese economy's
sluggish performance for years, prompting firms and households to
hold off spending on expectations of further falls in prices.
 While the central bank's June tankan business sentiment
survey showed a recovery was slowly taking hold in Japan, sharp
gains in the yen earlier this month added to uncertainty for an
economy already facing slowing factory output and rising
inventories.
 The BOJ is therefore hardly optimistic about the outlook.
 The Democratic Party-led government may also pressure the BOJ
for action should renewed rises in the yen or slowing global
growth hurt the export-driven recovery.
 That means the BOJ's policy bias remains towards monetary
easing, unlike several Asian economies that have begun tightening
such as South Korea, India and Thailand.
 The BOJ already loosely defines 1 percent core consumer
inflation as a desirable level of price growth. But calls for a
more binding price target may intensify, analysts say.
 The Democrats have said beating deflation is among their most
important policy goals. Many other parties have urged the BOJ to
set a price target including Your Party, a small opposition party
that won 10 seats in the weekend election.
 The International Monetary Fund said the BOJ could more
strongly commit to keeping monetary policy easy until core
inflation forecast is 1 percent or above.
 Japan's dire fiscal state leaves it with little room for
fiscal stimulus. Its public debt rose to 218 percent of GDP in
2009 from 188 percent in 2007, and without a fiscal adjustment
would approach 250 percent of GDP by 2030, the IMF said.
 The BOJ has kept interest rates at 0.1 percent since late
2008, and eased monetary policy last December and again in March
by setting up and later expanding a facility offering cheap funds
to banks.
 Japan's economic growth is expected to moderate from an
annualised 5 percent expansion in the first quarter, the
second-fastest among G7 countries, as the boost from government
stimulus measures tapers off.
 The BOJ issues long-term economic and price forecasts each
April and October and reviews them three months later.

Inflation at the producer and consumer level also eased in June
from May, reducing the need for further policy tightening.

remaining essentially steady, the message is that currency
appreciation will remain modest and there is no strong pressure

287,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2010 08:36PM ET</span>",US Exim Bank to review India coal plant request," * Export-Import Bank of US earlier rejected application
 * India's Reliance Power seeks $600 million loan guarantee
 By Lesley Wroughton
 WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - The Export-Import Bank of
the United States on Wednesday agreed to proceed with a review
of export financing for a coal-fired power plant in India,
weeks after it rejected the application due to environmental
concerns.
 India's Reliance Power has requested a $600 million loan
guarantee from Exim Bank to support the sale and export by
Wisconsin-based Bucyrus International of mining equipment to
the 4,000-megawatt Sasan power plant in central India.
 The proposed transaction would support hundreds of jobs at
Bucyrus and its U.S. suppliers, Exim Bank said in a statement.
 The Exim Bank's board of directors voted on June 24 not to
proceed with the application due to environmental concerns, a
move U.S. export groups said would cost American jobs.
 The Bank, however, reversed that decision on Wednesday,
saying it would proceed with a full financial, technical and
environmental review before its board votes on whether to
support the application.
 Exim Bank said it decided to revisit the application after
Reliance Power agreed to cap the project's emissions at 850
grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour. It also committed to
develop a 250-megawatt renewable energy facility, which when
built will be among the largest renewable energy projects in
India, Exim Bank said.
 ""We are pleased that Reliance is making this commitment to
renewable energy, which allows us to sustain U.S. jobs and
promote both conventional and renewable energy exports,"" Exim
Bank President Fred Hochberg said in a statement.
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
 But environmental groups said supporting the coal project
goes against an overall approach by the Obama administration to
cut greenhouse gas emissions.
 Washington has targeted cutting emissions by 17 percent
from 2005 levels, by 2020, but that plan is stalled in the U.S.
Senate.
 In April, the United States was among four countries,
including Britain, the Netherlands and Italy, which withheld
support for a controversial $3 billion World Bank loan for a
coal-fired plant in South Africa due to environmental worries.
 The plant being developed by South African utility Eskom,
which had suffered chronic power shortages, would use the
latest so-called clean coal and carbon storage technologies
available on the market, and be developed alongside a renewable
energy project.
 The U.S. Treasury said it had not supported the Eskom loan
due to concerns about the climate impact of the project,
warning the World Bank not to propose similar coal projects in
middle-income countries without a plan that ensures there is no
increase in carbon emissions.
 Environmental groups said the Sasan project would generate
some 26 million tonnes annually of greenhouse gas emissions,
more than Exim Bank's annual emissions for all fossil fuel
projects approved in 2009.
 ""It is notable and ironic that the administration pressured
Exim to reverse its position and give the green light to
Reliance Power,"" said Michelle Chan, coordinator of economic
policy projects at Friends of the Earth.
 She said that technically Exim Bank only voted to approve
the enhanced due diligence for Sasan, adding: ""It wouldn't be
totally surprising if the agency were forced to abandon other
policies and standards to get this deal done.""

 * Asia to eye Chinese data, weak numbers a risk for Aussie
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, July 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was under
pressure on Thursday, holding near two-month lows on a basket of
currencies, although high-yielders like the Australian dollar
were vulnerable to a sell-off if Chinese data disappointed.
 A slew of Chinese data is due for release later in the Asian
session. Data includes consumer inflation for the year to June,
industrial product numbers, retail sales, investment data for
June and second-quarter gross domestic product.
 Any hint of a slowdown in China could see profit-taking in
growth-linked currencies like the Australian  and the New
Zealand dollars , traders say.
 Strong U.S. corporate earnings being released this week
encouraged investors to seek higher-yielding currencies, and the
euro, but have not helped the greenback which has been mired by
concerns about a U.S. slowdown.
 ""A lot of the data I am looking at - things like real time
port activity - has slowed materially and this should show up in
industrial production today,"" Robert Rennie, chief currency
strategist at Westpac wrote on the Reuters Dealing Room.
 ""I find it hard to believe that the Australian dollar should
be doing well with very real signs of rising concern on U.S. data
plus Chinese softening.""
 Currently, weak U.S. retail sales numbers for June and dovish
Federal Reserve's minutes of its last meeting were prompting
investors to cut long positions on the U.S. dollar.
[ID:nWALEIE6D2]
 In Asian trade, the dollar index was down at 83.36, holding
just above support at around 83.15, the 38.2 percent retracement
of the index's rise from a low of 74.17 in November 2009 to a
high of 88.59 on June 8.
 The greenback was broadly steady on the yen  at 88.32
yen, having slid 0.5 percent on Wednesday. Traders in Tokyo said
if the Chinese data came in weaker than expected, it could spark
fresh demand for the Japanese currency and the yen could rise
above the 88 per dollar level.
 The yen usually gains when there is a spike in risk aversion
and fears of a global slowdown drives investors to safe-haven
assets.
 The euro  was steady at $1.2740, off a high of $1.2778
struck on Wednesday, its highest since early May. The euro pared
some of its gains, although sentiment was holding up given recent
successful bond auctions in Portugal, Germany and Greece.
[ID:nATH005574]
 Against the yen, the euro was steady at 112.49 ,
having shed 0.4 percent on Wednesday. The Aussie was lower on the
yen, down 0.26 percent at 77.91 yen .
 The Australian dollar  was slightly lower at $0.8820,
paring gains after hitting a fresh two-month high of $0.8871 on
Tuesday. The NZ dollar  was down 0.3 percent at $0.7212
after hitting a two-month high of $0.7254.

 * Lula says will try to warm French hearts to deal
 * Barroso: if we win World Cups, we can reach trade deals
 By Raymond Colitt
 BRASILIA, July 14 (Reuters) - Brazilian and European
business leaders urged their governments on Wednesday to
accelerate talks on an ambitious trade accord, despite the
euro-zone crisis and opposition from European farmers.
 The European Union and South American trade block Mercosur
in May relaunched talks that had been on hold for six years
with the aim of creating the world's largest free-trade zone,
encompassing 750 million people and goods valued at 65 billion
euros ($82 billion) a year.
 The initiative faces strong opposition from farmers,
environmentalists, and lawmakers in Europe.
 ""It's been advancing very slowly. We need to speed things
up,"" Robson Andrade, head of Brazil's CNI industry federation,
said on the sidelines of an EU-Brazil summit in the capital
Brasilia.
 Farm lobbies in France and elsewhere in Europe have
criticized a possible accord in recent weeks, warning that
cheaper imports such as Brazilian ethanol or meat did not meet
environmental or health standards and could wipe out local
producers.
 ""The most difficult part as always is agriculture,"" said
Pierre-Alain De Smedt of the Belgian Business Federation.
 ""We want an ambitious accord. It's important the
politicians keep this in mind as they come under political
pressure,"" he added.
 WARMING FRENCH HEARTS
 Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he would
try to persuade French President Nicolas Sarkozy in coming
months to throw his support behind the deal.
 ""We need to warm the hearts of the French,"" Lula said.
 Some industry leaders talked up the benefits of a deal for
European businesses struggling with the euro-zone crisis.
 ""At a moment of crisis in Europe, it's important to be able
to count on fast growth in countries like Brazil. We will do
everything we can to push authorities on both sides,"" said
Jorge Rocha de Matos, head of the Portuguese Industry
Association.
 Brazil's economy is expected to grow by more than 7.5
percent this year as European countries struggle to emerge from
recession and a region-wide debt crisis.
 EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso acknowledged
negotiations would not be easy.
 ""We're 27 countries, we need to gather support on many
fronts, in many sectors,"" Barroso said.
 But the EU chief joked that if the two regions'
achievements in soccer were any indication, the outlook for a
trade deal was good.
 ""Have you noticed that the World Cup has only been won by
countries of the European Union or Mercosur? If we are able to
always win the World Cup, we should be able to reach an
historic accord that is as good for our economies as the
EU-Mercosur deal,"" Barroso said during a news conference
following a meeting with Lula and EU President Herman Van
Rompuy.
 Mercosur is made up of founding members Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay. Venezuela, whose entry depends on
approval from Paraguay's parliament, will participate in talks
as an observer.

 TORONTO, July 14 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar ended
lower against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday after a
cautious assessment from the U.S. Federal Reserve fueled
concern about economic recovery.
 In the minutes of a policy meeting released on Wednesday
afternoon, the U.S. central bank sparked concern by suggesting
additional measures may be needed if an already softening
economic outlook were to take a turn for the worse.
[ID:nN14148574]
 The assessment sparked jitters on financial markets and
helped to push down the price of oil, a key Canadian export, as
well as pressure U.S. stocks, typically a barometer of risk
appetite. [O/R] [.N]
 ""I sense that the dovish tone may have caused a bit of
concern on the part of investors, so we're seeing now more of a
risk aversion trade with Treasuries higher and risk assets such
as the Canadian dollar being sold off,"" said Millan Mulraine,
economics strategist at TD Securities.
 ""The fact that they thought about (additional measures to
boost the economy), injected it as part of the discussion ...
does suggest that there perhaps might be a chance they can do
it if economic conditions aren't sufficient.""
 Also weighing on investor sentiment was weak U.S. retail
sales data for June, the latest in a series of reports to
suggest U.S. economic recovery has slowed in the past few
months. [ID:nN14122226]
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0341 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.70 U.S. cents, backing off a session high of
C$1.0286 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.22 U.S. cents. The currency
finished slightly down from Tuesday's close of C$1.0337 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.74 U.S. cents.
 The next key event for the market will be the Bank of
Canada's interest rate announcement on July 20, and market
expectations lean toward a rate increase, said Sacha Tihanyi,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 Canadian primary dealers and global forecasters surveyed by
Reuters said the Bank of Canada will raise its key overnight
interest rate next week, but that the pace of subsequent hikes
is less clear. [CA/POLL]
 In a separate poll, economists said Canada's economy will
expand at a fast enough clip this year to prompt the Bank of
Canada to continue raising rates, but growth is expected to
slow in 2011. [ECILT/CA]
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the Bank of Canada's key policy rate, are
pricing in an 90.8 percent likelihood of a July 20 rate hike.

 BONDS FLAT TO HIGHER ACROSS CURVE
 Canadian government bond prices were flat to slightly
higher on Wednesday, tracking U.S. Treasuries, which rose on
the Fed's softer economic outlook. [US/]
 ""It's a bit of support from the U.S. bond market to the
Canadian market,"" said TD's Mulraine.
 Canada's auction of 10-year bonds met with decent demand on
Wednesday as the country's solid economic fundamentals drew
international investors to safe-haven assets. [ID:nN14108425]
 The two-year bond  ticked 2 Canadian cents higher
to yield 1.709 percent, while the 10-year bond  was
up 7 Canadian cents to yield 3.267 percent.
 Canadian bonds underperformed U.S. issues. The yield on
Canadian two-year bond  was 110 basis points above
its U.S. counterpart, compared with about 104 basis points in
the previous session.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped and U.S.
stocks wavered on Wednesday after disclosures that Federal
Reserve policy makers in June expressed concern about the pace
of the U.S. recovery.
 The dollar fell against the yen and the euro hit a
two-month high as the release of minutes of the Federal
Reserve's June 22-23 policy meeting added to concerns about the
path of the economic recovery. Earlier in the day, the
government reported that U.S. retail sales in June declined for
a second straight month. [ID:nN14122226]
 Markets were choppy throughout the day as the fresh signs
that economic growth looks sluggish at best dimmed the prospect
of strong corporate results and tarnished the upbeat sentiment
from blow-out quarterly results by top chip maker Intel. For

 Fed policy makers felt they should be ready to consider
additional steps to boost the U.S. economy if an already
softening outlook took a noticeable turn for the worse, the
minutes showed. [ID:nN14148574]
 The Fed's minutes put the central bank in the slow patch
camp, said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth
Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
 ""Essentially, it has confirmed some of the fears of
investors, namely that the recovery is going to take some time,
and that's the last thing we wanted to hear from the Fed,""
Hellwig said.
 Sales at U.S. retailers fell in June as weak receipts at
automotive dealers and gasoline stations provided further
evidence the U.S. recovery has slowed in recent months from an
already-modest pace. [ID:nN14122226]
 Technology shares rose after Intel Corp  posted
results after the bell on Tuesday that beat analysts
expectations by a wide mark, but the Dow and S&P ended the

 Oil settled near $77 per barrel as the combination of
bullish U.S. crude inventory data and bearish economic news
left oil seesawing between positive and negative territory.

 U.S. crude  settled down 11 cents to $77.04 after
rising as high as $78.15. Brent crude  was trading up 3

 ""Crude futures turned negative after the release of the
minutes of the most recent Fed meeting on the lower growth
outlook,"" said Chris Dillman, analyst at Tradition Energy,
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""But I don't think the revisions are big enough to warrant
a deeper decline here in crude futures,"" Dillman said.
 U.S. Treasuries climbed as the weak retail sales data and
the pared-back economic outlook from the Federal Reserve

294,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2010 03:04PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Big money tiptoes back to Europe," * Investors rethinking Europe equity as euro zone stabilises
 * Policymakers gradually building a firebreak in euro crisis
 * Core euro zone growth still brisk; volatility ebbing
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Whether the euro zone is at the
middle or end of its existential sovereign debt crisis,
investors are starting to take a fresh look at the region's
assets and wondering if this year's market panic was overdone.
 Few analysts would be brave, or rash, enough to sound an
""all-clear"" on the regional financing storm -- one seeded by
Greek government profligacy and dodgy statistics but which also
exposed flaws in the single currency's framework and spread
rapidly to other highly-indebted euro governments.
 The global reverberations through April and May saw equity
volatility -- the seismograph of financial shocks -- soar to
levels not seen since the depth of the 2008/2009 global
recession, even as euro zone industrial production growth was
roaring at an annualised rate in excess of 10 percent.
 Spooked by a lack of visibility and heightened political
risk, investors scrambled to reduce exposure to euro government
debt, underlying equity markets and banking stocks and the euro
currency itself. Conviction about the likely outcome was less
important than the fact it was impossible to see a roadmap.
 Yet after three months of infusing market prices with ""tail
risks"" -- or worst-case scenarios from cascading sovereign
defaults to banking system collapses and euro breakup -- money
managers are again looking for opportunities to exploit the
resulting price extremes in the event of more probable outcomes.
 The question now is whether that euro asset phobia has run
its course and whether EU policymakers -- backed by the Group of
20 leading world economies -- have managed to create a firebreak
with their May 10 rescue package for euro bond markets.
 Two months on, a progress report shows the authorities have
at least reached first base -- stabilising bond prices with
selective buying by the European Central Bank and stopping the
hysteria, contagion and self-feeding spirals that forced Greece
to be locked out of capital markets altogether.
 Debt market premia for the peripheral euro zone governments,
with the exception of Spain, are all below pre-rescue levels.
And despite a credit rating downgrade in the interim, Spain has
continued to sell bonds around the world to brisk demand.
 European equity markets have rebounded by six percent, while
equity market volatility has almost halved. Even the euro has
managed to return within a whisker of pre-rescue levels against
the U.S. dollar.
 
 RESCUE REACHES FIRST BASE
 So far, so good then. For euro governments, time has been
bought to get parliamentary approvals for the rescue; establish
a special financing vehicle to act as future fireman; rebuild
confidence in European banks via stress tests and -- crucially
-- pass austerity budgets to fill in widening fiscal holes.
 For investors, the political fog starts to lift, visibility
returns and they can resume what they do best -- assess
valuations, high-frequency economic and earnings data and
relative pricing.
 And in that regard, they find a premium on European blue-chip
dividends over core government bond yields at its highest level
since the Lehman Brothers' bust in autumn 2008 and Thomson
Reuters data shows these equity risk premia almost two
percentage points above historical averages.
""Despite the fiscal austerity measures coming out of the
region, we think that Europe is now an interesting place
to invest,"" Henry McVey, New York-based head of Asset Allocation
at Morgan Stanley Investment Managers, told clients this month.
 ""Now may be the time to consider shifting regional
preferences out of the United States and back towards Europe.""
 Such views were almost startling in their rarity this year
-- certainly after six months in which fund tracker EPFR
reported a net $12 billion exiting western Europe equity funds.
 Not to get carried away, McVey goes on to explain that a big
price spike may not be warranted; public cohesion around
austerity plans was still a risk; and bullishness centred on
rotating to core ""value"" stocks rather than ""growth"" stocks.
 But he added: ""We now believe that -- compliments of the
Greek debt debacle -- European financials and energy companies
have become more attractively priced.""
 Fund managers polled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch this
month also showed extreme pessimism easing and they reported that
underweight positions in euro zone equity fell to almost a third
of extreme June levels.
 Likewise, euro currency bears have also retreated and data
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows speculative
""short"" euro contracts falling to a third of May peaks.
 Even global demand for European government debt has
re-emerged with Spain's international bond issue. China's
currency reserve managers are reported to have taken almost 10
percent of this month's 6 billion euro debt sale -- soothing
fears that central banks were cutting euro exposure.
 The euro zone has not imploded in a puff of smoke and,
despite its many travails ahead, the investment world cannot
ignore the world's second biggest economy for long.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded to a
two-month high and global stocks edged higher on Wednesday as
blow-out results from top chip maker Intel offset revived fears
of a stalled recovery after weak U.S. retail sales for June.
 Markets were choppy as the prospect of strong corporate

sluggish at best. For details see: [ID:nLDE66D03M]
 European shares snapped a six-day winning run, with banks
sliding on worries that tough new capital and risk rules will

 But Wall Street nosed higher, led by technology stocks,
after Intel Corp  late on Tuesday posted
forecast-beating quarterly earnings and revenue that allayed
fears of a technology spending slowdown.
 ""It continues to be corporations ... that are driving the
economic recovery,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer
at Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.
 Regarding the poor retail sales data, Ghriskey said: ""The
consumer can be very fickle and very subject to short-term

 Sales at U.S. retailers fell for a second straight month in
June as weak receipts at automotive dealers and gasoline

 The strong U.S. corporate earnings encouraged investors to
seek higher-yielding, higher-risk currencies and assets,
lifting the euro and triggering a bevy of automatic buy orders

early May.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
on Wednesday and the dollar fell against the yen as data
showing U.S. retail sales declined for a second straight month
stoked fears the U.S. recovery may be slowing.
 Strong U.S. corporate earnings also encouraged investors to
seek higher-yielding, higher-risk currencies and assets,
lifting the euro and triggering a bevy of automatic buy orders
that pushed it above $1.2770, its highest since early May.
 Sterling soared to a 10-week high as better-than-expected
UK employment data added to speculation the Bank of England may
have to start thinking about raising interest rates.
 Earlier, the euro fell below $1.27 on lingering concern
about some euro zone countries' debt woes. However, recent
smooth bond auctions in Portugal, Germany and Greece have eased
such worries.
 The dollar, meanwhile, struggled after the June retail
sales report, which followed data on Tuesday showing a wider
U.S. trade deficit in May.
 The dollar has not been helped by positive corporate
results as some investors see them as a lagging indicator of
economic health. Markets are instead watching for data that
suggests the economy could slow in the second half of the
year.
 Analysts said some investors were bracing for the Federal
Reserve to trim its growth forecast when minutes from its most
recent policy meeting are released this afternoon.
 ""People are focused on the softness of U.S. economic data,""
said Marc Chandler, senior currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York. ""The euro's pullback against the
dollar has been shallow. The market still wants to take the
euro higher.""
 The euro traded at $1.2768, up 0.4 percent and just off a
session peak. It was unchanged at 112.99 yen, while the dollar
fell 0.2 percent to 88.50 yen.
 Sterling rose 0.7 percent to $1.5275 after earlier hitting
its highest level since May after better-than-expected
employment data.
 EARNINGS, TECHNICAL BOOST EURO
 While U.S. data has been on the soft side, U.S. corporate
earnings have been surprisingly strong so far, and that's also
helped risk appetite.
 The next target for euro/dollar was the $1.30 area, said
Roberto Mialich, currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Others said the next target was at $1.2780, the 50 percent
retracement of the euro's fall from mid-April to the June low.
 Richard Ross, technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson in
New York, said breaks through $1.27 and then $1.2760 brought in
new buyers and said momentum may carry it to $1.28.
 ""Markets like round numbers and 1.28 is a good
psychological one, even though it is not a particularly key
technical indicator,"" he said. ""But certainly, a lot of people
would like to see that one go.""
 With the U.S. 10-year Treasury yielding barely more than 3
percent, traders also cited a growing demand for
higher-yielding assets and growth-related currencies.
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars rose against the
greenback on Wednesday while stocks recovered earlier losses.
 ""If growth is slowing, yields are likely to fall, so people
want to lock in higher yields now,"" Chandler said. ""That's
feeding a healthy appetite for risk.""
 The trend appears to hold for private and public investors.
The latest Treasury data shows central banks increased
purchases of U.S. agency and corporate debt, both of which
offer higher yields than Treasuries.
 But Walter Zimmerman, vice president and chief technical
analyst at United-ICAP, says the jury's still out on whether
the euro has bottomed. The currency is still down 11 percent
against the dollar this year.
 ""We need to see the euro take out $1.2850. That will do it
for us,"" he said. ""That would say, 'OK it is it's not an
intermediate term bear market rally in the euro.'""

 * Icesave talks in more constructive spirit, next in August
 * Wants China to buy its fish, encourage tourism to Iceland
 
 By Farah Master
 SHANGHAI, July 14 (Reuters) - Iceland is likely to seek
accession to the European Union as a means to rebuild its
shattered economy, the country's foreign minister Ossur
Skarphedinsson told Reuters on Wednesday.
 Skarphedinsson, interviewed during a visit to Shanghai, also
said Iceland was keen to develop economic links with China, from
cooperating on geothermal energy projects to attracting Chinese
tourists to the North Atlantic island.
 Iceland, a nation of just 320,000 people, is trying to
rebuild investor confidence after the 2008 collapse of its top
banks and crown currency at the height of the financial crisis.
 Its central bank agreed a currency swap with China in June
for around $500 million and Skarphedinsson said the possibility
of another swap was still open if needed.
 The crisis prompted Iceland to apply to join the EU last
year, but public support for the move remains low.
 Skarphedinsson said it would be very difficult to strike a
deal with the EU on Iceland's lucrative fishing areas but that
Icelanders would be tempted by the eventual prospect, once in
the EU, of qualifying to adopt the euro currency.
 ""We have had a very bitter experience with our present
currency, the krona, long before the crisis, and it is clear to
a lot of people that it is impossible to sustain a micro
currency in a world that is globalised,"" Skarphedinsson in an
interview.
 Formal EU accession talks are to take place at the end of
July while more detailed negotiations should start next year,
said Skarphedinsson.
 
 ICESAVE; CHINA TIES
 Asked about talks over the collapse of the Icesave bank that
collapsed in 2008, he said these were more constructive and
positive than before, but added: ""I would not dare to say that
the gap between nations has lessened.""
 The British and Dutch governments want Reykjavik to repay
the $5 billion they paid to Icesave depositors whose funds were
frozen in the failed scheme.
 Skarphedinsson said he would not speculate when the issue
would be resolved, but he expected the next round of talks to be
in August.
 Officials from the three countries held their first talks
earlier this month, after Icelanders overwhelmingly rejected a
payment plan in March.
 Skarphedinsson also said he had spoken with China's Vice
President and Foreign Minister on the possibility of geothermal
cooperation in countries like Ethiopia.
 ""They were very interested in this,"" he said, adding that
China had the financial power and Iceland the expertise to tap
places in East Africa with great geothermal potential.
 ""Of course we are looking to China as the biggest market in
future, looking to China as a market for our fish and for
getting tourists,"" Skarphedinsson said.

300,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2010 10:40AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-More adjustment needed in 2014 Irish budget-IMF," (Recasts with comments on fiscal plan)
 WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - Ireland's fiscal
consolidation plan through to 2014 is ""appropriately ambitious""
but the adjustment needed may be larger than the authorities
envisage, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.
 In an annual review of Ireland's economy, IMF staff said
Ireland's budget deficit for 2014 will be 5.9 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) versus the target agreed with the EU of
a deficit smaller than 3 percent of GDP.
 ""The staff's macroeconomic projections imply that the
required medium-term adjustment could be larger than projected
by the authorities,"" said an IMF staff paper published
alongside the review.
 ""The authorities concurred with staff on the importance of
meeting the targets they have set within the agreed timeframe,""
said the paper, which details discussions between the IMF and
Irish government.
 The IMF urged the authorities to introduce a medium-term
budget framework, and recommended adopting a fiscal rule and a
fiscal council to advise on risks to public finances. These
would also enhance policy credibility, the IMF added.
 The IMF said fiscal and banking measures adopted by the
authorities have helped stabilize the economy but cautioned
that economic vulnerabilities are elevated.
 The IMF said the economy will likely shrink by around 0.5
percent in 2010, maintaining its forecast from June when an IMF
mission visited Dublin.
 ""Growth prospects are weighed down by the ongoing
correction of pre-crisis imbalances,"" the IMF said.
 The IMF said there is a large agenda remaining to fix
Ireland's banking sector. It urged the authorities to ensure an
""orderly"" disposal of property assets accumulated by the
National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), Ireland's ""bad bank"".
This would help restore the commercial property market, the IMF
added.
 ""Rather than aiming to time the market for an upturn in
property prices, the goal should be to reduce the large
overhang of property in state hands, restart the market
transactions and, thus, help normalize the property market,""
said an IMF staff paper published alongside the review.
The IMF urged early action to introduce a special bank
resolution mechanism, to strengthen the stability framework.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro and dollar slipped
against the yen on Wednesday as data showing U.S. retail sales
fell for a second straight month raised concerns that the U.S.
recovery was starting to sputter.
 Sterling soared to a 10-week high as data showing a fall in

Wednesday and Tuesday's successful sale of Greek government
paper. [ID:nATH005574].
 Worries about heavily indebted euro zone countries such as
Greece, Portugal and Spain have driven the euro down some 12

have not evaporated, markets are feeling less on edge of late.
 ""Investors are breathing a sigh of relief for now as the Q2

problems appear more stable,"" said UBS currency strategist

 PRAGUE, July 14 (Reuters) - Demand and prices fell at a
Polish bond auction on Wednesday a day after inflation data
lifted chances of an interest rate hike, while investors snapped
up the first Czech bond to go on sale in a month.
Central European governments have battled rising yields on
their debt in recent months due to high borrowing needs, the end
of monetary easing policies, and fears over their ability to
deliver on fiscal austerity promises.
 The Czech Republic and Poland have found it easier to sell
debt than Hungary or Romania, both of which receive aid from the
International Monetary Fund and European Union, but must still
contend with what is expected to be record borrowing this year.
 Economists expect Poland to be the first country in central
Europe to begin raising interest rates. Those hikes may begin as
early as this year, economists say, after data on Tuesday showed
June consumer inflation unexpectedly accelerated.
 Coming on the heels of a 5-year dollar bond placement last
week, growing expectations of a looming interest rate rise
helped cut demand at the auction of 5-year domestic paper on
Wednesday.
 Warsaw sold 2.03 billion zlotys ($635 million) worth of
benchmark PS0415 paper at Wednesday's primary tender with the
average yield rising to 5.373 percent from 5.144 percent in May.
 After the tender, yields in the secondary market crept up to
5.41 percent.
 ""Higher-than-expected CPI could have contributed to
expectations that monetary tightening is going to be frontloaded
rather than backloaded,"" Michal Dybula, chief economist at BNP
Paribas in Warsaw, said. 
 Despite avoiding recession and emerging from the downturn
last year with the fastest-growing European economy, Poland has
struggled to convince investors it can keep debt from breaching
levels that trigger, by law, harsh spending cuts.
 The narrowness of the victory for Prime Minister Donald
Tusk's candidate in a presidential runoff this month also cast
doubt on government reforms before a 2011 election.
 ""This will not help the Polish bond markets, particularly in
relative comparison to regional peers,"" Dybula said.
 
 CZECH ISSUANCE FEARED
 In contrast to the Polish auction, investors bid for more
than twice the offer at the Czech Republic's first bond auction
in a month on Wednesday. 
 The Czech Finance Ministry sold 7.74 billion crowns ($387.2
million) worth of 5-year bonds. The average yield rose to 3.001
percent from 2.936 percent at a May 12 auction for the same
paper.
 Czech bond yields have dropped from 2010 highs hit last
month with hope an incoming centre-right government will go
through with promises of austerity. 
 But asset swap spreads, the risk premium paid over the
interbank market, have stayed elevated due to second half
issuance worries. The Finance Ministry only met around a third
of its overall 2010 borrowing in the first six months.
 ""Banks and local funds will have to swallow this higher
supply, so it is likely to see some additional widening in asset
swap spreads,"" JP Morgan economist Miroslav Plojhar said.
 The ministry postponed a Eurobond in April and will likely
wait until after the summer lull. The launch of a foreign issue
would help relieve local pressure.
 Some analysts have said Romania may have to look at another
international bond issue after having trouble meeting its needs
on local markets since May, when it first unveiled cost-cutting
measures to bring it in line with aid conditions.
 The Finance Ministry has rejected most bids asking for a 7
percent or higher yield, and has had trouble selling below that.
 ""With high inflation, weaker growth and still a very sizable
current account deficit, interest rates given the risk
environment are way too low. They will have to give in at some
stage because they need to finance a pretty significant fiscal
deficit,"" Dybula said.
 The ministry borrowed 1.1 billion lei on the money market on
Tuesday and could opt for a similar action if a fresh treasury
bill tender on Thursday is not successful.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic
recovery will likely just plod along, forcing the central bank
to keep interest rates low, but the chance of a dip back into
recession is fading, according to the latest Reuters poll.
 Median forecasts from the survey of around 40 economists,
taken over the past week, suggest quarterly growth will not
exceed 0.4 percent per quarter from here through to the end of
next year, unchanged from last month's poll.
 ""Moderate growth will persist for a while. The road ahead
will look like a recovery but not like an upswing,"" said
Jens-Oliver Niklasch at LBBW.
 Economists kept their full-year growth forecast for the
current year at 1.1 percent but trimmed their outlook for 2011
to a 1.3 percent expansion from 1.4 percent growth. That
compares to 2011 forecasts for 2.0 percent growth in major
trading partner Britain and 2.8 percent growth for the United
States.
 The 16-nation bloc's biggest economy, Germany, is expected
to grow 1.6 percent next year while France is seen growing 1.3
percent.
 The bloc escaped from its deepest recession in post-war
history in the third quarter of last year, having pumped
billions of euros into recovery packages. It is expected to have
grown 0.6 percent in the quarter to end-June and fears of a
double-dip appear to be receding.
 But governments are now faced with the financial headache of
having to slash budgets to recoup the cost of the bailout while
simultaneously preventing a slide back into recession. Meanwhile
91 European banks facing stress tests designed to restore
confidence in the financial sector have put a dampener on more
optimistic forecasts.
 But according to around 25 economists in the survey who
answered an additional question, there is a only a 20 percent
chance of a return to recession, down from the one-in-four
chance given last month from a similar sample.
 ""With decent economic growth in the core countries -- mainly
Germany -- a double-dip recession remains a risk and not a base
scenario,"" said Juergen Michels at Citi.
 A lower euro -- which has been battered by fears over the
debts of Greece and other euro area members and hit a four-year
nadir last month -- and low interest rates are likely to prop up
the modest recovery for the time being, Michels added. 
 The sluggish growth path will not be helped by rising
unemployment, expected to peak at 10.3 percent later this year.
Euro zone unemployment held steady at 10 percent in May,
slightly less than the 12-year high of 10.1 percent expected.
 
 ECB ON HOLD
 The outlook means the European Central Bank is not seen
raising rates from their record low of 1.0 percent until July
2011 at the earliest, in line with a poll taken two weeks ago.
 Benchmark interest rates are seen rising to 1.25 percent in
the third quarter of 2011 and then rising by 25 basis points to
end the year at 1.5 percent, the same as the last poll.
 Inflation is seen averaging 1.4 percent this year and then
nudging up to 1.5 percent in 2011, remaining significantly below
the central bank's two percent target ceiling.
 Data released earlier on Wednesday showed prices rose 1.4
percent year-on-year in June, compared to 1.6 percent in May.

 By Ross Finley
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - The world economy will cool a
bit in the next few months as powerhouses China and the United
States gear down and governments attempt to dam rivers of red
ink, Reuters polls of over 600 economists showed on Wednesday.
 Yet several Asian economies, like India's and South Korea's,
are expected to perform better this year than thought just a few
months ago, underscoring how uneven the global recovery has
become from a historic financial crisis and deep recession.
 Reuters polls conducted around the world over the past
several days show hatchets taken to growth forecasts for the
U.S. in the coming quarters and no Federal Reserve interest rate
rise until next year.
 But looking further out, economists remain optimistic about
world growth prospects. They expect decent global GDP growth of
4.2 percent this year and 4.0 percent in 2011, slightly faster
than the last poll taken three months ago.
 There is also a consensus view among analysts that the
quarter just ended was stronger than many had been forecasting
earlier in the year, meaning an impending slowdown in the second
half could pinch, even if things brighten again in 2011.
""Globally, things are slowing, but ... deceleration is coming
from what look like stronger levels of Q2 growth than many
expected,"" said Dominic Wilson, director of global macro and
markets research at Goldman Sachs in New York.
 ""The toughest issue is how much to rely on better-than-
expected growth outside the U.S.,"" he said.
 The findings come just as the U.S. company earnings
reporting season kicks into gear, where expectations are high on
the cusp of a week-long recovery rally in stock markets from
depths dug last month on worries the global economy is slowing.
 
 JOBS AND RED INK
 The likelihood of a growth slowdown, along with benign
inflation, means that major central banks that still have rates
held at rock-bottom, like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the
European Central Bank, will keep them there well into next year.
 But many of those that have raised interest rates recently
-- like central banks in Korea, India, Canada, Sweden and New
Zealand -- are likely to raise rates again this year, perhaps
several more times in some cases.
 In China, the world's third largest economy, growth is
expected to cool gradually as the government takes away stimulus
it provided during the financial crisis. But its economy will
still grow 10 percent this year and 9 percent in 2011. India is
also expected to expand rapidly.
 But there have been clear signs global growth is slowing,
particularly in the latest round of purchasing managers' indices
of private sector companies in both manufacturing and services.
 High unemployment remains one of the gravest risks to
recovery across the developed world, pressuring household
budgets already reeling from the financial crisis and now facing
impending tax increases from cash-strapped governments.
 ""It is going to require a lot more growth to start to move
the economy forward on a basis that feels acceptable,"" said
Jonathan Basile, economist at Credit Suisse.
 The U.S. economy shed jobs in June for the first time since
last year and there is little hope that the jobless rate will
fall much from 9.7 percent currently unless growth picks up.
 The consensus shows the U.S. jobless rate averaging at or
above 9 percent until near the end of 2011.
 Unemployment is expected to linger near 10 percent as well
in the euro zone, where many governments have embarked on budget
cutbacks that will pressure the labour market if the private
sector is not strong enough to pick up the slack.
 The greatest fiscal worries remain concentrated in the euro
area, where the single currency was hammered earlier in the year
on concerns Greece's fiscal woes would spread to other smaller
economies that also use the euro.
 But for now, most economists are not sounding the alarm
bells, bracing for lacklustre growth at worst.
 ""With decent economic growth in the core countries -- mainly
Germany -- a double-dip recession remains a risk and not a base
scenario,"" said Juergen Michels, European economist at Citi.
 The poll found a median one in five chance of a double-dip
scenario materialising in both the euro zone and Britain.

 By Oksana Kobzeva
 MOSCOW, July 14 (Reuters) - Belarus sees turbulent relations
with Russia, its source of oil and gas supplies, and the slow
speed of structural reform as key risks for potential investors,
according to a preliminary prospectus for its maiden Eurobond.
The land-locked country's representatives are meeting
investors in Europe this week to discuss an expected issue of up
to $1 billion Eurobond organised by BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank,
RBS and Russia's Sberbank.
 The preliminary prospectus, a copy of which was obtained by
Reuters on Wednesday, dedicated seven pages to the risks of
investing in the former Soviet republic -- more than twice as
much as Russia did for its April Eurobond. Belarus has been
hard hit by recession in key trading partners Russia and the
European Union, which together buy some 75 percent of its
exports but halved purchases in 2009. 
 Minsk needs cash but also hopes the issue will open up the
global capital markets for its companies.
""Investment in emerging markets like Belarus involves a high
degree of risk and investors should exercise particular care in
evaluating the risks involved,"" said the document, dated July 9.
 It cited ""a narrow export base, reliance on imports, fiscal
and current account deficits, low currency reserves, reliance on
foreign loans and investments and changing political, economic,
social, legal and regulatory environments.""
 On the Eurobond market, Belarus faces competition from
Ukraine, which already has a history of such issues, and is
expected to price a $2 billion issue this week.
 However, Minsk has the advantage of higher ratings --
Standard & Poor's rates Belarus foreign currency long-term
sovereign debt 'B+', higher than the 'CCC+' it has on Ukraine.
 
 REFORM KEY TO ATTRACT CASH
 The $50 billion Belarus economy stagnated in 2009, and the
government hopes for a recovery this year with growth of 11-12
percent, helped by an improved global backdrop.
 But higher charges for Russian oil and gas -- subjects of
bitter rows, featuring supply stoppages and even the threat of
cut-offs in onward supply to Europe -- are expected to weigh on
finances.
 The higher prices could increase the current account deficit
by up to $2 billion,Belarus said in the prospectus.
""A deterioration in Belarus's relations with Russia could
adversely affect the supply of energy resources to Belarus and
Russian investment in Belarus and therefore have a negative
effect on Belarus's economy,"" the prospectus said.
 The document also acknowledged ""complex"" relations with the
EU and the United States, but said improving ties was a foreign
policy objective as ""Belarus aims to attract more foreign
investment and to further integrate into the world economy"".
 Domestically, Belarus pledged to continue stabilisation
measures and support the banking system, while the central bank
is expected to press on with gradual rate cuts.
 Minsk also acknowledged it faced a challenge in reducing the
state's direct role in the economy.
 ""Progress on such reforms to date has been slow and reforms
of this nature are likely to be politically unpopular,"" the
prospectus said.
 ""The extent to which Belarus will be able to attract broad
scale investment in the absence of significant political reform
is uncertain. Further borrowing from the IMF, the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other international
financial institutions may also be conditional on such reform.""
 President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since
1994 in what analysts describe as a Soviet authoritarian style,
faces elections next year and needs cash to keep raising state
wages and pensions, as promised.
 Belarus in April received the last tranche of a $3.5 billion
IMF loan agreed at the end of 2008, and has said it will not ask
for a new credit.

 * Minister says offering big subsidies is ""bad policy""
 
 By Peter Griffiths
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Britain can no longer afford to
offer generous grants to attract foreign companies to invest in
the UK because its priority is to cut a record peacetime budget
deficit, Business Secretary Vince Cable said on Wednesday.
 While foreign investment will form an important part of
Britain's recovery from the worst recession in decades, Cable
said the coalition government favoured pro-business policies
over subsidies.
 ""Having very substantial amounts of money which we are
splaying out in grants and subsidies to companies, we cannot do
that,"" he told a news conference. ""There is a budgetary problem
which we inherited. The second reason is that it is actually
very bad policy.""
 Ministers will instead focus on setting competitive business
tax rates, cutting regulation, training workers and looking
after the broader British economy, he added.
 Britain has in the past offered large grants to support
sectors such as the car industry, which relies heavily on
foreign-owned manufacturers investing in British factories.
 A government spokesman was unable to give an immediate
estimate of the total annual value of subsidies given to foreign
companies to invest in Britain.
 British public spending faces its tightest squeeze for
years. The government unveiled a package of spending cuts and
tax rises in June designed to cut the deficit to almost nothing
in five years. [ID:nLDE65L0CF]
 Finance minister George Osborne has ordered many government
departments to cut spending by at least 25 percent to help
reduce the deficit, running at 11 percent of GDP.
 Although large subsidies may be on the way out, Prime
Minister David Cameron said the government wanted a ""big step
change"" in its diplomatic relations to try to encourage trade.
 ""We are coming out of a very deep and difficult recession,
growth is fragile, and it is absolutely vital for our country
that we attract the maximum amount of inward investment,"" he
told a London investment conference.
UK Trade and Investment, the government trade and export
body, said the last year had been difficult.
 However, Britain still attracted a record 850 new investment
projects, creating 53,000 new jobs and safeguarding 43,000 more.
 The United States remained the top investor, with software
and advanced engineering the biggest sectors in terms of numbers
of projects.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro held near a two-month
high against the dollar on Wednesday, supported by strong U.S.
corporate earnings and easing concerns about euro zone sovereign
debt after three countries in the bloc sold bonds.
 Traders said funds were increasingly moving out of cash and
low-yielding U.S. Treasuries to buy the euro and growth-related
currencies as S&P futures <.SPX> rose after earnings from
Intel Corp  beat expectations on Tuesday.
 Investors were encouraged after smooth auctions of German
and Portuguese bonds, following a successful sale of Greek
government paper on Tuesday. [ID:nATH005574].
 ""Investors are breathing a sigh of relief for now as the Q2
earnings season has begun well and euro zone peripheral problems
appear more stable,"" said UBS currency strategist Geoffrey Yu.
 Analysts said a German offer of five-year notes went
smoothly, while Portugal managed to sell more than it had been
expected in two- and seven-year bonds, albeit at higher yields.
Demand at Italian auctions was mixed. [ID:nLDE66D0AM]
 While the results had little impact on the euro, the single
currency held gains, having recovered losses suffered after
Moody's downgraded Portugal's sovereign rating on Tuesday.
 By 1136 GMT, the euro  eased slightly from late U.S.
trade on Tuesday to $1.2709, but was not far from a two-month
peak of $1.2739  hit the previous day.
 Movements could be limited by options with a strike price of
$1.2700 set to expire later in the day, analysts said.
 The next target for euro/dollar was the $1.30 area, in a
head-and-shoulders configuration starting from the low below
$1.20 struck last month, said Roberto Mialich, currency
strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Others said the next target was at $1.2780, the 50 percent
retracement of the euro's fall from mid-April to the June low.
 Data showing slower euro zone inflation, as expected, and a
slightly lower-than-expected reading in industrial production
[ID:nBRLEIE63T] had little impact on the market.
 The euro hit a three-week high of 113.29 yen 
before paring gains to trade around 112.50 yen.
 
 LOSING MOMENTUM?
 The dollar  was little changed at 88.61 yen. Options
with strike prices of 88.50 yen and 89.00 yen were set to
expire, which may limit movements, traders said.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down slightly at 83.56, having
broken below the trendline linking the November and April lows.
New support was seen around 83.15, the 38.2 percent retracement
of the index's November to June rally.
 The euro was caught in narrow ranges, and some analysts said
this month's rally was petering out as investors awaited more
signs of an improving global economy.
 ""The euro has lost momentum, and its upside requires another
push higher in equities,"" said Adam Cole, global head of
currencies at RBC.
 ""It has benefited the most from risk demand, so further
gains will require more positive U.S. earnings surprises.""
 European shares <.FTEU3> slipped 0.3 percent following a
six-day winning streak, while S&P futures pointed to a higher
opening on Wall Street later in the day. 
 The market awaits minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's
June 22-23 policy meeting, due at 1800 GMT, with speculation
policymakers may have discussed further easing measures.
 U.S. June retail sales, due at 1230 GMT, will also be in
focus with the market expecting sales fell 0.2 percent.

 By Huw Jones
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Tests of how the European
Union's banks could withstand severe shocks without taxpayer
help are adequate and cover sovereign debt exposures, Britain's
financial watchdog said on Wednesday.
 ""I think the European stress tests ... have an adequately
stressed approach and it will be applied across Europe,"" Adair
Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority told
reporters.
 How the authorities will respond to any banks that fail the
test will be shown when the results are announced, Turner said,
adding that it would be clear that ""significant stress"" had been
built into the tests to see how banks would cope, both in terms
of systemic shocks and particular country crises.
The results are due on July 23 and European Union finance
ministers remained divided on Tuesday over what data would be
published although they pledged to make them as transparent as
possible. [ID:nLDE66C1GF]
 Markets worry the tests are not stringent enough,
particularly in countries like Spain, and whether governments
have funds to recapitalise a bank that fails the test.
 Borrowing by Spanish banks from the European Central Bank
surged in June with a net 126.3 billion euros ($160.5 billion)
borrowed -- representing a quarter of the overall amount lent by
the euro zone's central bank. [ID:nLDE66C1RA]
 Spanish bank Banesto  posted a 6.8 percent fall in
first-half profit after hiking bad-debt provisions, but said its
capital levels were resilient if the Spanish economy
deteriorated sharply. [ID:nLDE66D04B]
 The Europe-wide plan is to announce how banks would fare if
economic conditions worsened, including a deeper fall in the
value of sovereign bonds. The tests will apply, for example, a
23 percent discount on Greek sovereign debt held in banks'
trading books, a source told Reuters on Tuesday. [ID:nLDE66C1HT]
 But there have been splits in the 27-nation EU over how to
model such scenarios and how much to publish once the results
are in from questionnaires sent out to banks last week.
 Turner has already said that banks in the UK will pass.
 ""Within the FSA last year we did even more extreme stresses.
Part of the reason why we then did not actually publish the
detailed results is that when do a really extreme stress there
is a danger of misinterpretation of it,"" Turner said.
 He expected authorities to move towards annual
across-the-board stress tests, which would be made public, and
behind them tests of specific institutions ""on a rolling basis
... doing even more extreme tests"".
 
 SLOW-BURN BASEL
 Investors hope that results from the stress tests in Europe,
coupled with details of new tougher global bank capital and
liquidity rules will give greater certainty.
 The Basel Committee of central bankers and supervisors like
the FSA from across the world meet in Switzerland on Wednesday
and Thursday to finalise work on a global package of bank
capital and liquidity reforms.
 ""We are working on ending up with a significant package of
increased capital and liquidity. We are trying to get global
agreement on definitions of capital, commonalities we did not
have before, a global standard on liquidity,"" Turner said.
 He dampened hopes that the Basel meeting will make any
announcements on what new levels of capital banks will need.
 ""We will not be announcing that stuff until later in the
year. This is an ongoing part of the process,"" Turner said.
 ""We need to think we need to think about how much we are
increasing capital and liquidity requirements, then we need
transition timetables that enable us to go to a more stable
system while minimising any effects on the rate of growth in the
meantime.""
 The Group of 20 leading countries, which is due to endorse
the new bank rules in November, has already agreed on a phase-in
from 2012 that will be longer than originally planned.
 Banks and some governments say too-speedy implementation
would make it harder for banks to continue lending to aid
recovery.
Britain's banks will meet the FSA and the government on
Thursday and banks are under pressure to meet anticipated
lending targets to small businesses to spur faster growth.
 The government will also outline how it will scrap the FSA
and divide its supervisory duties between the Bank of England, a
new consumer protection and markets authority and a new serious
crime busting agency.
 ""We are well aware of the need to phase regulatory reform so
that it does not slow the recovery from recession,"" Turner said.

 (Adds Radicova, Miklos quotes, background)
 BRATISLAVA, July 14 (Reuters) - Slovakia postponed until
Thursday a decision on signing the euro zone's emergency loan
facility that would oblige it to help indebted euro zone
partners, the government said on Wednesday.
 Slovakia, where refusal to bail out richer euro zone members
played prominently in campaigning ahead of an election last
month, has been holding up the EU's 750-billion-euro ($953
billion) EFSF scheme designed to help countries in trouble.
 The new government led by Iveta Radicova has been refusing
to take part in a separate aid plan for Greece.
 It has also been putting off signing up to the EFSF,
although it has said it would not block the EU and is widely
expected to eventually give in.
 The government will hold a meeting on Thursday to debate the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and a bilateral
loan to Greece, worth around 800 million euros.
 ""There will be a coalition meeting tonight to debate this
issue,"" Radicova told reporters after the government meeting,
adding the cabinet would meet again on the issue at 0800 GMT on
Thursday.
 Finance Minister Ivan Miklos, a fiscal hawk, said this
week's negotiations with his EU counterparts in Brussels on
Slovakia's position were not easy. The previous government led
by Robert Fico supported the aid schemes.
 ""Today, we are in a situation when we choose only among bad
solutions,"" Miklos told reporters.
 Slovakia, the euro zone's poorest member, joined the single
currency in 2009. The euro zone's debt crisis and demands to
chip in to bail out richer members was far from what the Slovaks
expected from membership.
 Miklos said he thought it was wrong that a country with
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of just 72 percent of
the EU's average be expected to help richer countries.
 The Slovak minimum monthly wage is 308 euros and the average
is 725 euros, which is below even the minimum legal Greek wage
of 863 euros. Opinion polls have shown two-thirds of Slovaks are
against extending aid.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said
he expected Bratislava to sign the EFSF very soon, while
Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker expected Slovaks to sign
the framework agreement (on the EFSF) and take on board all the
commitments made by the previous cabinet.
 If Bratislava signs off on the EFSF vehicle, it can move
ahead. However the Slovak parliament must vote on Slovak
participation worth 4.5 billion euro in guarantees.

 * WTO: China cannot use censorship to justify trade barrier
 
 GENEVA, July 14 (Reuters) - China has agreed to open up its
market for entertainment goods by March 19 next year in line
with a World Trade Organization ruling, China and the United
States said on Wednesday.
 The United States had challenged China's barriers to imports
and distribution of books, music, films and other entertainment
products, and China finally lost an appeal in the case at the
WTO last December.
 China had argued that entertainment goods should be handled
differently from other imports because of their cultural impact,
but the United States said that China was wrong to impose
monopolies on imports that were authorised for sale or were
anyway available through pirated copies.
 The original WTO ruling, handed down in August last year,
did not dispute the Chinese communist authorities' right to
censor material they found objectionable, but said they could
not use censorship to justify illegal trade barriers.
 The United States had argued that the Chinese controls
robbed Hollywood and U.S. publishers and music producers of the
chance to make substantial sales, leaving the market to pirates.
 The agreement in the case follows a deal by Google ending
its censorship dispute with China, though China and the United
States are still divided over the internet.
 A letter from the Chinese and U.S. ambassadors to the WTO,
published on the WTO website on Wednesday, said the two
countries had agreed that China should implement the WTO's
ruling within 14 months of its adoption by the global trade body
on January 19 this year.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro held near a two-month
high against the dollar on Wednesday, supported by strong U.S.
corporate earnings and easing concerns about euro zone sovereign
debt, which also helped push equities higher.
 Traders said funds were increasingly moving out of cash and
low-yielding U.S. Treasuries to buy euro and growth-related
currencies.
 Earnings from Intel Corp beat expectations and the
technology gaint gave an upbeat sales outlook, pushing S&P
futures higher.
 Investors were also encouraged after a smooth auction of
Greek government paper on Tuesday..
 ""Investors are breathing a sigh of relief for now as the Q2
earnings season has begun well and euro zone peripheral problems
appear more stable,"" said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at
UBS.
 By 0923 GMT, the euro eased slightly from late U.S. trade on
Tuesday to $1.2709, not far from a two-month peak of $1.2739
hit the previous day.
 Movements could be limited by options with a strike price of
$1.2700 set to expire later in the day.
 The next target for euro/dollar is the $1.30 area, in a
head-and-shoulders configuration starting from the low below
$1.20 struck last month, said Roberto Mialich, currency
strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 Intermediate resistance could emerge around $1.28, he said,
adding: ""We could see a new trading band of $1.25 - $1.30.""
 Others said the next target would come in at $1.2780, which
is a 50 percent retracement of the euro's fall from mid-April to
the June low.
 Data showing slower euro zone inflation as expected, and a
slightly lower-than-expected reading in industrial production
had little impact on the market.
 
 YEN LOWER
 The euro also hit a three-week high of 113.29 yen before
paring gains to trade around 112.90 yen.
 Good absorption of the Greek debt overrode concerns about
Portugal's sovereign rating being downgraded by Moody's on
Tuesday. It had a stable outlook, which some said had helped
limit fears about the country's debt. 
 The yen remained pressured and fell 0.1 percent against the
dollar at 88.80 yen, with talk of stop-loss bids above 89.25
yen.
 Options with strike prices of 88.50 yen and 89.00 yen were
set to expire, which may cap movements, traders said.
 The dollar index was down slightly to 83.56, having broken
trendline support. New support is seen around 83.15, the 38.2
percent retracement of the index's November to June rally.
 The Australian dollar hovered near $0.8828 after hitting a
three-week high of $0.8851.
 Other major U.S. corporates to report quarterly earnings
this week include JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp.

 The market will look to the minutes of the U.S. Federal
Reserve's June 22-23 policy meeting, due at 1800 GMT, on
speculation policymakers may have discussed further easing
measures.
 U.S. June retail sales, due at 1230 GMT, will also be in
focus with the market expecting sales fell 0.2 percent.

 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a three-week
high on Wednesday while government bonds fell broadly after
Intel's forecast-beating quarterly results raised expectations
of strong corporate earnings in the second quarter.
 Resilient demand for PCs and servers helped Intel Corp's
 margin and revenue forecasts blast past Wall Street
expectations, allaying fears of a technology spending slowdown
and sending its shares up nearly 8 percent in pre-market trade.
[ID:nN12197658]
 Tuesday's upbeat news came after the closing bell on Wall
Street, which rallied for a sixth straight day after Alcoa
posted  bullish results late on Monday.
 European stocks pulled back in mid-morning trade though as
banks lost ground as European regulators were due to finalise
tough new bank capital and liquidity rules. But U.S. stock
futures pointed to a firmer open on Wall Street as investors
look to earnings from key U.S. firms such as JP Morgan 
and GE  later this week.
 ""We are momentum trading again driven on absolutely
ridiculously low volumes ... but I don't think there is any
doubt that ... (we have) corporate news and results that are

said David Buik, senior partner at BGC partners.

 Bund futures  erased losses after Portugal's
two-year bond issue saw strong demand after a spike in the
yield.
 The euro held near $1.27 , within half a cent of the
previous day's two-month high, as improving risk appetite
boosted high-yielding currencies and investors welcomed a
successful treasury bill tender by Greece on Tuesday.

 * Won seen gaining in 2010 less than previous forecast
 By Cheon Jong-woo
 SEOUL, July 14 (Reuters) - South Korea's economy is
expected to grow much faster this year than economists had
forecast three months ago as demand both at home and abroad is
expanding more strongly, a Reuters quarterly poll shows.
 Most of the 21 analysts surveyed saw the central bank
raising the interest rate to as high as 2.5 percent by the end
of this year, however, many of the forecasts were made before
the Bank of Korea surprisingly raised the rate on July 9.
 Analysts downgraded their views on the won compared with
three months ago and said lingering investor anxiety about the
European debt crisis would limit the upside for what is Asia's
worst performing currency so far this year.
 ""The economy will continue to post solid growth because the
slowing recovery in the U.S. and Chinese economies will not
amount to a double-dip slump situation and seriously hurt the
domestic economy,"" said Kim Jae-eun, an economist at Hyundai
Securities.
 ""The Bank of Korea raised rates earlier than expected, but
a further increase will not come that fast,"" added Kim, who
made his forecast after the Bank of Korea raised rates by 25
basis points from a record-low 2 percent on July 9.
 Asia's fourth-largest economy is now forecast to expand by
5.7 percent in 2010, compared with expectations of 5 percent
growth in the prior quarterly poll published in April.
 It has pulled out of the 2007/2008 crisis ahead of most
others and has already been tipped to enjoy the fastest growth
next to Turkey this year among members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development.
 The central bank on Monday raised its economic growth
forecast for this year to 5.9 percent from 5.2 percent, weeks
after the finance ministry lifted its growth projection to 5.8
percent from 5 percent.
 Analysts believe the Bank of Korea will continue to raise
its rate next year, taking it to 3.5 percent by the end of 2011
-- the same as in the April poll.
 Economic growth in 2011 will slow to 4.5 percent, the
latest survey found, also unchanged from the April poll, due to
expectations of slowing growth in the United States and China
as well as the fallout from the debt crisis in Europe.
 The won, which has fallen around 3 percent against the
dollar so far this year, is seen ending the year at 1,100 per
dollar and 1,050 at the end of the next year, compared with
1,202 at the end of local trade on July 12.
 ""Reflecting uncertainties, the won is seen staying around
1,200 per dollar for the time being,"" said Lee Chul-hee, an
economist at Tong Yang Securities.
 In the previous survey, the South Korean unit had been
expected to rise to 1,065 per dollar by the end of 2010 and
1,000 per dollar at the end of 2011.

 By Matthias Williams and Abhijit Neogy
 NEW DELHI, July 19 (Reuters) - India's $13 billion current
account deficit is manageable and will be covered by capital
inflows, Trade Secretary Rahul Khullar said on Monday, playing
down concerns about the worst shortfall in nearly 3 decades.
 While the current account deficit figure for the current
June-August quarter has not yet been made public, the deficit
widened to $13 billion in the January-March quarter, the
biggest since 1981, compared to $12.2 billion in
October-December, official data showed.
But Khullar told Reuters in an interview that this did not
worry the government as capital inflows will be more than
sufficient to finance the deficit.
 He also pointed to the slight improvement in the balance of
payments surplus, which in Jan-March was $2.1 billion compared
with a surplus of $1.8 billion in the Oct-Dec quarter, as
another factor to ally concerns.
""I run a huge deficit on the balance of trade on goods and a
surplus in my services account, as a result that my current
account deficit is manageable. Manageable in that it remains
within 1.5 to 2 pct of GDP,"" Khullar said.
 Despite the crisis in the euro zone, capital flows have
been robust this year with an inflow of $8.5 billion so far.
 India's current account deficit has been widening since the
first quarter of 2009, sparking concern that it will continue
to deteriorate, and eventually weigh on the rupee.
 Despite foreign holdings of Indian equities reaching an
all-time high this year and the Reserve Bank of India, the
central bank, being the most aggressive rate hiker in Asia, the
rupee is near its 2010 lows against the dollar.
 Analysts say this highlights that India's current account
deficit has reached levels that are now a material influence on
the currency. The rupee was at 47.09 per dollar on Monday, down
from Friday's close of 46.80/81.
 DEFICIT COULD WIDEN FURTHER
 Khullar, however, said capital inflows had a stronger
effect on the currency than the bulging current account
deficit, citing strong economic growth as more reason not to
worry about the shortfall or the currency.
 ""Exchange rates are not determined by trade flows any more,
they are predominantly determined by capital flows,"" he said.
 Analysts say the current account deficit could widen to 3
percent of GDP, but said that should not worry investors
because of India's strong economic growth, forecast at 8.5
percent this fiscal year.
 ""The CAD could widen to 3 percent but I think that's normal
for a high-growth economy. Even then, there should not a
problem because the outlook on capital flows this year is
pretty firm though at the moment things are sluggish,"" said N.
Bhanumurthy, economist with NIPFP, a Delhi based economic
think-tank.
 India's trade deficit marginally improved in June and stood
at $10.55 billion, down 6.63 percent from May, data released by
the Trade Secretary showed.
 India's June exports rose an annual 30 percent to $17.75
billion, for the eighth straight month, Khullar said.
 Imports for June also rose 23 percent to $28.3 billion, he
said.
 For the rupee, the near-term direction is not very clear.
 It is expected to track the euro and global stock markets,
but in the medium to longer term, rate hikes will help the
currency gain as interest rate differentials between India and
other countries widen.
 Analysts said any hike in interest rates could open up more
arbitrage opportunities for capital inflows into the country,
though rupee appreciation will also be a problem and has to be
contained to cushion exports.

equities and $7.7 billion in debt in 2010.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro held steady near a
two-month high against the dollar on Wednesday, with
high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar supported
by a seemingly significant improvement in risk appetite.
 The dollar could come under more pressure, especially against
higher-yielding currencies, in reaction to robust U.S. corporate
earnings.
 Intel Corp reported results above expectations and gave an
upbeat sales outlook, pushing S&P futures higher.
 Traders said funds were increasingly moving out of cash and
low-yielding U.S. Treasuries to buy euro and growth-related
currencies. Helping drive sentiment was a strong start to the
U.S. corporate earnings season and easing concerns about euro
zone's sovereign debt and the financial sector.
 The euro was little changed from late U.S. trading on Tuesday
at $1.2710. It hit a two-month peak of $1.2739 on Tuesday,
brushing aside a Moody's downgrade of Portugal's sovereign rating
by two notches.
 Instead, investors chose to pay more heed to the strong
response to a six-month treasury bill tender by Greece. The
debt-laden country sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.03 billion) of
T-bills at a better rate than it pays to borrow under a European
Union/International Monetary rescue fund. For more see.
 ""What we are seeing is that cash is being put back to work
with all the negative news surrounding the euro zone receding,""
said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS, Sydney.
 ""Some of the risk premium that was being attached to the euro
zone is being taken off. The downgrade of Portugal was very much
expected and I think we could see the euro rise a bit more from
here.""
 Chartwise, resistance is seen at $1.2767, the target of an

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro held steady near a
two-month high against the dollar on Wednesday, with
high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar
supported by a seemingly significant improvement in risk
appetite.
 The dollar could come under more pressure, especially
against higher-yielding currencies, in reaction to robust U.S.
corporate earnings. Intel Corp reported results above
expectations and gave an upbeat sales outlook, pushing S&P
futures higher.
 Traders said funds were increasingly moving out of cash and
low-yielding U.S. Treasuries to buy euro and growth-related
currencies. Helping drive sentiment was a strong start to the
U.S. corporate earnings season and easing concerns about euro
zone's sovereign debt and the financial sector.
 The euro held steady from late U.S. trading on Tuesday at
$1.2725. It hit a two-month peak of $1.2739 on Tuesday,
brushing aside a Moody's downgrade of Portugal's sovereign
rating by two notches.
 Instead, investors chose to pay more heed to the strong
response to a six-month treasury bill tender by Greece. The
debt-laden country sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.03 billion) of
T-bills at a better rate than it pays to borrow under a
European Union/International Monetary rescue fund.
 For more see.
 ""What we are seeing is that cash is being put back to work
with all the negative news surrounding the euro zone receding,""
said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS, Sydney.
 ""Some of the risk premium that was being attached to the
euro zone is being taken off. The downgrade of Portugal was
very much expected and I think we could see the euro rise a bit
more from here.""
 Chartwise, resistance is seen at $1.2767, the target of an

344,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2010 11:32PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-No sunset yet for China's property clampdown," * China will fine-tune, not reverse, property tightening
 * Government is determined to deflate any bubble
 * Property prices to tumble and investment to follow
 * China will spend more on public housing to compensate
 By Simon Rabinovitch and Langi Chiang
 BEIJING, July 14 (Reuters) - Investors who bet that China
will declare an early end to its property tightening campaign
are doing so at their own peril.
 While the government is likely to fine-tune real estate
policy as the economy softens in the coming months, it is not
about to reverse tightening measures that it believes are
critical to safeguarding China's long-run growth prospects.
 Property prices have only just started to dip. Falls should
turn much steeper, with investment in the sector also taking a
clear hit, before the government takes its foot off the brake.
 ""It is, of course, aware that declining prices and
investment are the likely result,"" said Xing Ziqiang, an
economist with China International Capital Corp in Beijing.
 ""But so long as the economy is doing all right, slowing
gradually with no severe unemployment problem, the government
should be able to tolerate this.""
 That will disappoint those who thought they had already
spied a U-turn in Chinese policy.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Earlier this week, Chinese real estate shares soared after
a report that the government would relax a ban on mortgages for
third homes.
 This seemingly small change would have been explosive in
its symbolism, implying that the government was flinching at
the first signs of weakness in the property market.
 With unusual alacrity, the banking regulator and the
housing ministry published statements to deny the rumour.
 ""We don't see a loosening of policy in the near term
because even though some cities have seen considerable price
corrections, others haven't,"" James Xia, vice chairman of
Chinese developer Evergrande Real Estate <3333.HK>, said this
week.
 Nationwide, Chinese housing prices edged down 0.1 percent
in June from May, their first monthly fall since February 2009
-- and the first real fruit of the tightening steps, which have
included higher down payments and reduced lending to
developers.
 DEFLATING THE BUBBLE
 Notwithstanding the wishes of some investors, if China were
to stand down now from its property tightening campaign, it
could prove deeply disruptive to the economy's development.
 Just last week, Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at
the International Monetary Fund, warned that the country's
housing market was a bubble.
 Fleshing out this view, Yi Xianrong, an economist at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank,
made the jaw-dropping claim that there are about 65.4 million
empty apartments and houses in China's cities and towns, many
of them bought up by people wagering on a constantly rising
market.
 Although Yi's estimate, based on electricity meter
readings, was met with scepticism, it still served to
underscore how the government has a ways to go to put the
country's housing market on a more sustainable footing.
 ""We believe many analysts are underestimating China's
determination in curbing property prices,"" Ting Lu, an
economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said in a note.
 A little more than two years before the end of China's
decade-long political cycle, the current crop of leaders would
shudder at the prospect of a bubble inflating in the property
sector and bursting just before they leave office, Lu said.
 Politics aside, the economic importance of getting it right
is abundantly clear. The property sector makes up about 10
percent of national output and a quarter of capital spending.
 FINE-TUNING
 The government knows it has to walk a fine line. Its
zealousness in curbing a previous property construction boom
bore fruit just as the global financial crisis reached a
crescendo in late 2008, driving the Chinese economy to a near
halt.
 ""China will not issue more tightening measures,"" said Yang
Guohua, a property analyst with Oriental Securities. ""The
overall tightening policy will still be implemented, but there
may be some fine-tuning in the second half.""
 Much will come down to how bank branches and local
governments interpret rules.
 After the banking regulator reiterated the ban on
third-home mortgages, one commercial lender in Beijing told
Reuters that such loans were absolutely forbidden. But a state
bank in the booming port town of Ningbo said a third-home
mortgage could be arranged, provided the borrower's credit
record was clean.
 Still, investment in the property sector, running at 38
percent over a year earlier, is sure to slow.
 As that happens, the central government will spend more on
public housing to pick up the slack and cushion the economy,
said Sun Xuegong, a researcher in the National Development and
Reform Commission, a powerful central planning agency.
 ""China has the fiscal scope and political will to speed up
affordable housing construction and other projects to counter
the risk of a sharp slowdown in private investment,"" Sun said.

 By Aiko Hayashi
 TOKYO, July 14 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose to a
three-week high on Wednesday, led by gains in tech shares after
Intel's results beat market expectations, while the euro held
firm near two-month peaks against a softer U.S. dollar.
 European shares extended their rally into a seventh
session, rising 0.3 percent in early trade, as Intel's results
allayed fears that companies may be slowing down their spending
on technology.
 A strong start to the U.S. corporate earnings season this
week and easing concerns about the euro zone's sovereign debt
problems have helped buoy sentiment after a raft of weak U.S.
economic data sparked worries that the global economic recovery
was faltering.
 Investors also brushed aside a Moody's downgrade of
Portugal's sovereign credit rating by two notches, and chose to
focus on the strong response to a treasury bill tender by
debt-laden Greece.
 After the close on Wall Street, Intel Corp, the world's top
microchip maker, reported second-quarter earnings that blew
past analysts' expectations.
 Intel's upbeat view boosted Asian chip-related shares.
Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top maker of DRAM memory
chips, rose 3.5 percent and leading contract chipmaker TSMC
gained 1.3 percent.
 ""We believe Intel's result is just the beginning of the
many forecast-beating earnings to be reported by major U.S.
companies,"" said Yu Rayming, chief investment officer of
Prudential Financial Securities Investment Trust in Taiwan.
 ""Investor worries about a double dip in the global economy
have apparently eased, but bear in mind there is still
uncertainty hanging over the euro zone debt problems.""
 The MSCI ex-Japan share index was up 1.5 percent, having
earlier risen as much as 1.7 percent to its highest since late
June, after U.S. stocks rallied for a sixth straight day on
Tuesday.
 Optimism about this season's earnings rose after Alcoa
posted second-quarter results late on Monday that beat
expectations. Rail company CSX also posted a
higher-than-expected profit.
 Adding to the upbeat note, Intel executives said there are
clear signs of renewed spending by corporations.
 ""Now that corporations have some breathing room in the
economy and their budgets, you're starting to see those
machines that were four or five years old get refreshed,"" Intel
CEO Paul Otellini said in a conference call with analysts.
 Japan's Nikkei average surged 2.7 percent to its highest
close in three weeks, with chip gear manufacturer Tokyo
Electron and other chip-related shares powering higher. Tokyo
Electron rose 4.1 percent.
 The Nikkei ended at 9,795.24 points, cracking resistance at
the level of its 25-day moving average around 9,660.
 Shares of Komatsu, the world's No.2 construction machinery
maker, jumped more than 5 percent after it sharply raised its
full-year profit forecast, citing better-than-expected
first-half sales in Asia and Latin America, as well as a pick
up in demand in Japan and the United States.
 Buoyed by gains in tech stocks and strong buying by foreign
investors, South Korea's benchmark share index closed at its
highest level in more than two years, while Taiwan stocks hit a
two-month closing high. Both were up more than 1 percent.
 The focus is now on quarterly reports from JPMorgan on
Thursday and General Electric on Friday. China will also report
its second quarter GDP figures on Thursday amid signs that its
rapid growth is moderating.
 Still, some market watchers remained wary, noting that
further gains may be hard to achieve in the short term.
 An accumulation of long positions in the market, especially
in blue-chip exporters, could slow upward momentum, one analyst
said. Many rallies in recent weeks have been short lived as
traders quickly took profits after any negative news.
 ""Even though Intel may be good, there's some concern about
the bank earnings later this week. Good results from them are
necessary for the market to go much higher,"" said Hiroaki
Kuramochi, chief equity marketing officer at Tokai Tokyo
Securities.
 EURO STEADY
 In currency markets, the euro held steady at $1.2710 on
trading platform EBS, having jumped nearly 1 percent in the
previous session. It hit a two-month peak of $1.2739 on
Tuesday.
 Investors were also seen adding to long positions in
high-yielding currencies amid a seemingly significant
improvement in appetite for riskier assets.
 ""What we are seeing is that cash is being put back to work
with all the negative news surrounding the euro zone receding,""
said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS, Sydney.
 ""Some of the risk premium that was being attached to the
euro zone is being taken off. The downgrade of Portugal was
very much expected and we could see the euro rise a bit more
from here.""
 The Aussie and New Zealand dollars held near two-month
highs. The Aussie climbed to $0.8851 with resistance at the
June high of $0.8860, and at $0.8885, the 100-day moving
average and 61.8 percent retracement of its April 12 to May 25
slide.
 The New Zealand dollar pared some of its gains to trade at
$0.7170 after retail sales in May rose less than expected.
Still, the data did little to alter expectations of more
interest rate rises.
 Crude oil futures were little changed around $77 a barrel
after jumping nearly 3 percent overnight as
better-than-expected corporate earnings boosted confidence
about the economy.

 SINGAPORE, July 14 (Reuters) - Singapore said its economy
would grow a stunning 13-15 percent in 2010 after reporting a
record 19.3 percent year-on-year surge in second quarter
output, but analysts said there was little immediate risk of
overheating.
 The government said exceptionally strong growth in the
first half was unlikely to be sustained in the remainder of the
year given expected weaker U.S. and European demand for Asian
exports, though it played down a risk of another recession.
 ""The sluggish final demand in the U.S. and EU has moderated
industrial activities and lowered expectations for
manufacturing output in the Asian economies,"" the Ministry of
Trade and Industry said in a statement. ""The momentum of the
global economic recovery has thus moderated, although a
double-dip recession remains unlikely at this juncture.""
 Although coming off a low base, the second quarter number
is the highest in the history of the Southeast Asian city-state
and far exceeded analyst expectations. If the full-year
projection is accurate, it could make Singapore the
fastest-growing major emerging market economy in the world this
year.
 Economists said they did not see any policy response before
the central bank's semi-annual review due in October.
 ""I don't think there's a need for an immediate adjustment,""
said Dave Cohen at Action Economics. ""Inflation is under
control, the Singapore dollar is already on a rising trend and
commodity prices are moderating, which will help keep a cap on
price pressures.""
 He added: ""Singapore's growth will clearly surpass China's,
and may be the fastest in the world. But I won't put too much
emphasis on that. Singapore is rebounding from a contraction
whereas China continued to grow at an 8-9 percent pace last
year.""
 Financial markets showed muted reaction to the buoyant data
with the Singapore dollar a touch firmer and stocks up 0.8
percent, mainly in response to a strong Wall Street close.
 Singapore, reliant on manufacturing and exports, saw its
economy shrink 1.3 percent last year in the midst of the global
financial crisis.
 Wednesday's advance estimates showed second quarter output
surged 26.0 percent on an annualised, seasonally adjusted
basis, with especially strong growth in manufacturing,
particularly from the biomedical cluster.
 EURO ZONE EXPORTS SURGE
 The government also said that June non-oil domestic exports
surged 28.7 percent year-on-year and raised its full-year
exports growth forecast to 17-19 percent from an earlier 15-17
percent.
 Despite fiscal austerity plans announced by several
European nations, exports to the EU surged 75.1 percent over
the previous year, although shipments to the United States
remained static and export to China grew slower than in May.
 ""It looks like we are at the peak of the cycle,"" Citigroup
economist Kit Wei Sheng said. ""When you look at the numbers, it
is flattening out: the flat demand from the U.S. and some kind
of slowdown in China. It is not a slump, not a double-dip, but
a slowdown in growth.""
 Exports of electronics rose 43.9 percent from a year
earlier in June, while petrochemicals exports leaped 56.2
percent.
 The government also revised first quarter GDP data, saying
the economy grew a record 45.9 percent on an annualised basis
and 16.9 percent compared with the January-March period of
2009.
 Singapore originally said its economy contracted by 2
percent last year, its worst-ever showing, but the data was
subsequently revised to show a contraction of 1.3 percent using
a new time series that gave different weights to different
sectors.
 A median forecast of analysts polled by Reuters before the
data was for 2010 growth to reach 10.7 percent.

 SYDNEY, July 14 (Reuters) - The euro was holding firm near

said Greg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS, Sydney.
 ""Some of the risk premium that was being attached to the euro
zone is being taken off. The downgrade of Portugal was very much
expected and I think we could see the euro rise a bit more from
here.""
 Chartwise, resistance is seen at $1.2767, the target of an
A-B-C wave sequence starting from the euro's four-year low of
$1.1876, with the C-wave starting at $1.2152. The next target
comes in at $1.2780, which is a 50 percent retracement of its
fall from mid-April to the June low.
 The euro jumped to three-week highs of 113.03 yen ,
having advanced nearly 0.85 percent on Tuesday. The low-yielding
yen  was broadly under pressure, giving up gains even
against the U.S dollar. The yen, considered to be a safe-haven
investment, is usually sold off when risk appetite improves.
 The dollar was up at 88.83 yen, from 88.44 yen late in New
York on Tuesday, although resistance is seen around the 89.00/15
area.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was down at 83.56, having broken
trendline support. New support is seen around 83.20, the 38.2
percent retracement of the the index's rise from a low of 74.17
in November 2009 to a high of 88.59 on June 8.
 Other major U.S. corporates to report quarterly earnings this
week include banks JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Bank of
America Corp .
 The dollar will also take direction from a slew of U.S.
economic data slated for Wednesday. Mortgage reports will be
followed by readings on export and import prices for June, retail
sales for the same month and business inventories for May.
 Sterling was up 0.1 percent $1.5190 , well off
Tuesday's low beneath $1.50, after quarterly consumer price
inflation remained above the Bank of England's 2 percent target
rate. [ID:nLDE66C10Y]
 Meanwhile, the Aussie and New Zealand dollars held near
two-month highs. The Aussie climbed to $0.8836 with resistance at
the June high of $0.8860, and at $0.8885, the 100-day moving
average and 61.8 percent retracement of April 12 to May 25 slide.
 The New Zealand dollar  pared some of its impressive
gains to trade at $0.7180 after retails sales in May rose less
than expected. Still, it did little to alter expectations of more
rate rises. [ID:nSGE668002].

 By Jennifer Kwan
 TORONTO, July 13 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar ended higher
against the greenback on Tuesday, boosted by a return of risk
appetite on optimism over corporate earnings and a successful
Greek auction that eased worries about euro-zone debt.
 The Canadian dollar touched a high of C$1.0276 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.31 U.S. cents, its highest level since June 23,
as North American equity markets finished the session firmly in
the black.
 Investors were in the mood to buy riskier assets after
Alcoa Inc , the largest U.S. aluminum producer and seen
as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, reported stronger than
expected results and raised its estimate for global aluminum
consumption. [ID:nN13242453]
 That was followed by Greece's successful return to capital
markets with a T-bill sale, passing its first borrowing test
since securing a 110 billion euro emergency funding deal in
May. [MKTS/GLOB] [ID:nLDE66C0DH]
 ""It's pretty much the return of risk appetite that took
everything risky higher. We saw oil prices increasing,
commodity prices increasing, equities higher,"" said Matthew
Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0337 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.74 U.S. cents, up from Monday's finish at
C$1.0375 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.39 U.S. cents.
 Increased risk appetite saw global equities advance on an
upbeat earnings outlook, while oil prices rose above $77 a
barrel on optimism for the economic recovery and stronger
demand. [MKTS/GLOB] [O/R]
 As well, domestic data showed that strong demand from
Canadian businesses and consumers triggered a surge in imports
in May that outpaced exports, leading to the third consecutive
monthly trade deficit. [ID:nN13232203]
 ""The expectation was that it would be flat and the prior
number was revised lower, so wider, and that has negative
implications for GDP,"" said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist
at Scotia Capital.
 ""But when you look at the details the imports were very
strong, which is also good sign there's ongoing demand.""
 RBC's Strauss said key technical ranges for the currency
included C$1.0219 to the U.S. dollar and C$1.0380-C$1.0415.
 He added the currency would ""very much a prisoner of global
sentiment"" until next week's Bank of Canada interest rate
decision on July 20.
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the Bank of Canada's key policy rate, are
pricing in an 89 percent likelihood of a July 20 rate hike.

 RISK RALLY PRESSURES BONDS
 Canadian bond prices fell across the curve as investors
flocked to higher-yielding assets. [US/]
 ""It's part of the risk appetite returning and the market
more comfortable with the global recovery story,"" said
Strauss.
 The two-year bond  fell 5 Canadian cents to yield
1.711 percent, while the 10-year bond  sank 50
Canadian cents to yield 3.273 percent.
 Canadian bonds notched a mixed performance against U.S.
issues. The Canadian 2-year bond  was 105 basis
points above its U.S. counterpart, compared with about 104
basis points in the previous session.

 By Steven C. Johnson and Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
above $1.27 on Tuesday after a smooth Greek treasury bill
auction eased some concerns about Europe's debt crisis and took
the sting out of another credit rating downgrade for Portugal.
 A strong start to the U.S. corporate earnings season drove
risk appetite and also helped the euro, which rose more than a
cent on the day. A surprise widening of the U.S. trade deficit
in May weighed on the dollar.
 Sterling soared after hotter-than-expected UK inflation
data left investors betting that the Bank of England may have

 A ""very positive"" start to earnings season boosted risk
appetite, overshadowing the Portugal downgrade and helping the
euro, said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of currency sales at
Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. ""The euro has gone along for
the ride,"" he said.
 Alcoa Inc's  earnings lifted stocks more than 1
percent and Eliasson said the euro could gain further if
forthcoming quarterly reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co 
and Intel Corp  do not disappoint.
 The euro hit a session peak of $1.2739  and was
last up 1 percent at $1.2718. It earlier fell to a one-week low
of $1.2522 in European trade after Moody's Investors Service
cut Portugal's sovereign rating by two notches.
 A U.S. bank was seen protecting a short-term option barrier
at $1.25.
 The euro began to recover after Greece sold 1.625 billion
euros ($2.03 billion) of six-month T-bills at a better rate
than it pays to borrow under a European Union/International
Monetary rescue fund. For more see [ID:nATH005574].
 A strong response to a Spanish debt auction had taken the
euro to $1.2723 last Friday.

 ""Given that persistently dovish monetary policy from the
Bank of England has been a negative for the pound, upside
inflation surprises will likely be a positive for the
currency,"" Aroop Chatterjee, Barclays' chief FX quant

 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.2 percent to 88.41 yen
, moving further away from gains booked a day ago after
Japan's ruling party suffered a stinging defeat in
parliamentary elections.

 A wider-than-expected May U.S. trade deficit also raised

States' own budget concerns, analysts said. [ID:nN13239573] 
 ""It's a long-term trend that's been out of the spotlight
for awhile, but this reminds everyone that it's a major

 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign

351,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2010 04:00PM ET</span>",EU trade chief frustrated by anti-piracy talks," BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuters) - Europe's chief trade
negotiator expressed frustration on Tuesday at stalled talks on
a new anti-counterfeiting accord.
 European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht criticised the
position of other parties, without identifying them, at the
talks on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) between
11 states and authorities including the EU and United States.
 An agreement is sought to improve the enforcement of
intellectual property rights protection and to stem the booming
global trade in fake and pirated goods, particularly those
traded on the internet.
 But De Gucht said other negotiators had refused to
guarantee protection of European fashion brands and food names
against counterfeiting. 
 ""We still have a lot of disagreement on ACTA,"" De Gucht told
a committee of lawmakers at the European Parliament.
 ""Most of the negotiating parties only want to protect
copyright and trademarks, but they're not willing to do so for
designs or geographical indications. This would be a red line
(for the EU).""
 The negotiators agree a single enforcement mechanism between
them would improve their success in combating illegal trade but
they differ on what should be included in the deal. 
 Europe says fashion brands, such as Gucci and Prada, and the
place names used in foods such as Parma ham and Parmesan cheese
should benefit from stricter enforcement. 
 The United States is among countries resisting this call and
De Gucht said he would raise the issue with U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk.
 European Union negotiators have also been frustrated at
global trade talks in efforts to secure the exclusivity of place
names for European wines, spirits and foods -- an exclusivity
they say countries like the United States secure through
trademarks.
 ""There is a slight beginning of some hypocrisy,"" De Gucht
said.
 Critics say the anti-piracy deal could allow customs agents
to frisk travellers at airports and confiscate laptops and music
devices such as MP3 players if they contain illegal downloads.
 De Gucht dismissed Indian concerns that ACTA will hamper
India's legal trade in non-brand medicines. 
 The talks involving the United States, the EU, Japan,
Canada, South Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore,
Switzerland and Australia are supposed to end in a deal by the
end of this year.

 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
against the dollar on Tuesday after Greece successfully tapped
capital markets for the first time since late April, while
stocks rallied on the U.S. earnings season's strong start.
 Athens passed its first borrowing test by successfully
selling Treasury bills at a slightly lower yield than the 5
percent it pays under an emergency funding deal secured in May
with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 The auction, worth 1.625 billion euros ($2 billion) in
six-month Greek T-bills, still will be more costly for Athens
than a previous similar sale, underscoring future refinancing
challenges for the debt-ridden country. Demand was also lower.
 ""It's good for Greece and the euro, but (Greece) has a long
way to travel, as its economic challenges are pretty severe,""
said Paul Robinson, a currency strategist at Barclays Capital
in London. ""It's going to take years to figure this out, not
just one auction.""
 Also reminding investors of weaker euro-zone members'
financial woes was a two-notch downgrade of Portugal's credit
ratings by Moody's Investors Service. [ID:nLDE66C0FN]
 The euro  gained 1.06 percent to $1.2722, its highest
level in two months, also supported by hopes that companies
will report strong second-quarter earnings on both sides of the
Atlantic.
 Optimism about this season's earnings rose after Alcoa
, the first Dow component to report, posted
second-quarter results late on Monday that beat expectations.
Rail company CSX also posted a higher-than-expected profit. For
details, see [ID:nN12206110] and [ID:nN12205564].
 Investors have been eagerly awaiting the second quarter
earnings season for confirmation that a recent stock rally was
justified. The S&P rose more than 5 percent last week, its best
weekly performance of the year, despite rising fears the past
two weeks of a double-dip economic recession.
 ""Alcoa and CSX are core industrial companies that had
nothing but good things to say, making it harder to find
evidence of this double-dip recession we were worried about,""
said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge
Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 1.55 percent, while the the FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares jumped 1.74 percent
to, in its sixth consecutive session of gains.
 The benchmark European stock index closed at a three-week
high, with financial stocks among the top gainers. The STOXX

 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 160 points, or

continues in full force on Tuesday, with tech bellwether Intel
Corp's  report after the market closes.
 TRADE DEFICIT WEIGHS ON DOLLAR
 The U.S. dollar was also weaker against a basket of major
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.86 percent
after government data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened
unexpectedly in May. [ID:nN13240894]
 The greenback was also down 0.41 percent against the
Japanese currency , at 88.26 yen.
 ""The dollar is getting hurt across the board today on a
combination of things, including better earnings and a wider
U.S. trade gap,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at

 The good performance on equity markets also boosted
commodity prices in general, with prices of U.S. crude oil
rising more than 2 percent.
 The August crude contract  was up 2.47 percent at
$76.80 per barrel.
 U.S. Treasury prices slipped, on the other hand, before a
$21 billion auction of 10-year notes later Tuesday. The
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 10/32
in price, with the yield at 3.1 percent versus Monday's close

 By Denis Dyomkin
 MALOBYKOVO, Russia, July 13 (Reuters) - Major meat buyer
Russia should increase domestic breeding to be able to export
$1.5 billion-$2.0 billion worth of poultry meat and pork by
2020, Agriculture Minister Yelena Skrynnik said on Tuesday.
 ""By 2020 exports of poultry meat, under our calculations,
may reach 400,000 tonnes and pork 500,000 tonnes,"" Skrynnik told
a meeting chaired by President Dmitry Medvedev.
 ""The main markets will be the Commonwealth of Independent
States (11 countries of the former Soviet Union), South East
Asia, the European Union and the Middle East.""
 Russia, which covers much of its needs by imported meat, has
repeatedly said it aims to become an exporter. However,
officials offered different timetables.
 First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, who oversees the
farm sector, said in April 2009 Moscow aimed to become
self-sufficient in poultry meat and pork -- and even start to
export meat -- as soon as 2012.
 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in January Russia should
not only cover its own domestic needs but export poultry meat in
the next four to five years..
 Under the Russian Food Security Doctrine adopted in February
a minimum level of self-sufficiency in meat is set at 85 percent
of consumption volumes, but the doctrine does not say when this
level should be reached.
 Russia has so far managed to increase its poultry and pig
population, but could not stop a decline in cattle numbers.
 
 MEAT SAFETY
 Russian meat producers believe the set targets are feasible
only if certain conditions are met.
 ""Russia may export (by 2020) several hundred thousand tonnes
of poultry meat and pork,"" Sergei Yushin, head of the National
Meat Association Industry lobby, told Reuters.
 ""But the main condition for this should be not so much the
price (of meat), but our capacity to guarantee the product
safety through an efficient veterinary and sanitary control.
Importer countries should be convinced that the meat is safe.""
 He said Russia should also investigate thoroughly the needs
of potential importer countries.
 ""Currently, we understand the necessities of, say, Middle
East, northern Africa, China and Hong Kong markets which now
work with Brazil, the United States and Canada,"" Yushin said.
 ""But we should have ambitious plans. And we should
understand in the next one or two years what are the national
demands (of other countries).""
 He said Russia had already succeeded in starting exports of
poultry feet and pig hoofs -- which are not in demand in Russia
-- to China, Vietnam and Hong Kong.
 ""Exports rose to 10,000 tonnes last year from 2,000 tonnes
three years ago. This year we expect exports of 18,000 tonnes,""
Yushin said.

 * Exports, energy supply are key priorities
 * Siemens, VW, Airbus, BASF, Metro among delegation
 
 By Dave Graham
 BERLIN, July 13 (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel begins
a five-day visit to Russia, China and Kazakhstan on Wednesday in
a bid to establish a stronger foothold for German industry,
bolster its energy supply and address security concerns.
 Merkel, who has endured a torrid few months at home, will be
travelling with a delegation of top business leaders aiming to
sign a series of lucrative deals in export markets from which
German industry has profited greatly over the past decade.
 China's moves to make its yuan currency more flexible, civil
unrest in Kyrgyzstan and beefing up Germany's access to oil and
gas are likely to be on Merkel's agenda when she meets the
countries' leaders in coming days, government officials said.
 The trip should be a welcome distraction for the embattled
chancellor, whose popularity slumped to a record low in recent
weeks when she suffered an embarrassing rebellion in a
presidential vote that undermined her authority at home.
 German government officials said the growing economic
importance of China and the wealth of natural resources in
central Asia made it imperative for Germany to strengthen its
ties in the region.
 All three were modernising fast and looking to make big
investments. ""That's why the timing of this visit is so
important,"" one of the officials told reporters.
 Merkel's first stop will be in Yekaterinburg in central
Russia, where she meets Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. From
Thursday, she will spend three days in China, a bulwark of
demand for German goods in the economic crisis.
 There she will hold talks with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao
before flying to the Kazakh capital Astana, where Merkel will
discuss the violence that broke out last month in the south of
neighbouring Kyrgyzstan between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks.
 
 BUSINESS INTERESTS
 Merkel's delegation will include the bosses of carmaker
Volkswagen, industrial conglomerate Siemens, planemaker Airbus,
chemicals group BASF, retailer Metro and lender Commerzbank.
 German exports to China and Kazakhstan surged by more than
285 percent and 270 percent, respectively, between 2000 and
2009. Exports to Russia were up more than 200 percent over the
whole of that period, even though they have fallen by close to a
third since 2007.
 German industry leaders are hoping Merkel will encourage
Russia to undertake steps to overhaul its economy.
 ""Russia's competitiveness has declined in the last two or
three years,"" Klaus Mangold, head of the Committee on Eastern
European Economic Relations, told Reuters. ""The country must
modernise to become more competitive.""
 Germany relies on Russia for many of its mineral resources,
and figures show imports rose some 13 percent in the first
quarter of this year from the same period in 2009. However,
exports to Russia fell by over seven percent at the same time.
 The trip will be Merkel's first to Kazakhstan since she took
office in 2005. It is her fourth to China.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied
on Tuesday as Alcoa opened the U.S. earnings season with strong
results, while the euro recovered after Greece successfully
tapped capital markets for the first time since late April.
 Alcoa, the first Dow component to report, posted
second-quarter earnings late on Monday that beat expectations,
raising hopes of similarly strong results for other companies.
Rail company CSX also posted a higher-than-expected profit. For
details, see [ID:nN12206110] and [ID:nN12205564].
 Investors have been eagerly awaiting the second quarter
earnings season for confirmation that a recent stock rally was
justified. The S&P rose more than 5 percent last week, its best
weekly performance of the year, despite rising fears the past
two weeks of a double-dip economic recession.
 ""Alcoa and CSX are core industrial companies that had
nothing but good things to say, making it harder to find
evidence of this double-dip recession we were worried about,""
said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge
Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index

300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares jumped 1.96 percent,
in its sixth consecutive session of gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> climbed 138.72
points, or 1.36 percent, to 10,354.99, in mid-morning New York

Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 25.20 points, or 1.15 percent,
at 2,223.56.
 Alcoa's shares rose 1.5 percent. The U.S. earnings season
continues in full force on Tuesday, with tech bellwether Intel
Corp's  report after the market closes.
 GREECE PASSES TEST
 The euro recouped early losses against the dollar, up 0.6
percent at $1.2665, after Athens successfully sold 1.625
billion euros ($2 billion) of six-month Treasury bills.
 It was the first borrowing test for the debt-ridden country
since it secured a 110 billion euro EU/IMF emergency funding
deal in May. [ID:nLDE66C0DH]
 Greece managed to to get market funding at a slightly
cheaper cost than the 5.0 percent it pays to borrow under that
emergency funding deal, but the yield was still higher than a
previous similar sale. Demand was also lower.
 ""It's good for Greece and the euro, but (Greece) has a long
way to travel, as its economic challenges are pretty severe,""
said Paul Robinson, a currency strategist at Barclays Capital
in London.
 ""It's going to take years to figure this out, not just one
auction,"" he added.
 Concerns about the financial situation of weaker euro-zone
members still lingered, however, after Moody's Investors
Service cut Portugal's credit ratings by two notches to A1,
following a similar move by the S&P in April. [ID:nLDE66C0FN]
 The U.S. dollar was also weaker against a basket of major
currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> down 0.55 percent
after government data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened
unexpectedly in May. [ID:nN13240894]
 The greenback was also down 0.30 percent against the
Japanese currency , at 88.35 yen.
 ""The dollar is getting hurt across the board today on a
combination of things, including better earnings and a wider
U.S. trade gap,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 The good performance on equity markets also boosted
commodity prices in general, with prices of U.S. crude oil
rising more than 2 percent.
 The August crude contract  was 2.54 percent higher at
$76.85 per barrel.
 U.S. Treasury prices slipped, on the other hand, before a
$21 billion auction of 10-year notes later in the day. The
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down 5/32
in price, with the yield at 3.0844 percent versus Monday's
close of 3.06 percent.

 TORONTO, July 13 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar touched
its highest level in nearly three weeks on Tuesday, following
domestic trade data that highlighted strength in business and
consumer demand, and a successful Greek auction that eased
worries about euro-zone debt.
 The Canadian dollar touched a high of C$1.0292 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.16 U.S. cents, its highest level since June 23,
bolstered by rallying global equity markets after Greece
successfully returned to capital markets for the first time

 Athens sold 1.625 billion euros of six-month treasury
bills, passing its first borrowing test since securing a 110

 As well, domestic data showed that strong demand from
Canadian businesses and consumers triggered a surge in imports
in May that outpaced exports, leading to the third consecutive
monthly trade deficit. [ID:nN13232203]
 ""The expectation was that it would be flat and the prior
number was revised lower, so wider, and that has negative
implications for GDP,"" said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist
at Scotia Capital.
 ""But when you look at the details the imports were very
strong, which is also good sign there's ongoing demand.""
 At 10:17 a.m. (1417 GMT), the Canadian dollar  was
at C$1.0314 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.96 U.S. cents, up from
Monday's finish at C$1.0375 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.39 U.S.
cents.
 Increased risk appetite saw global equities advance on
earnings optimism, while the oil price rose above $76 a barrel
on optimism for the economic recovery and stronger demand.
[MKTS/GLOB] [O/R]
 ""The risk mode is risk-on,"" said Sutton, who noted that a
softer U.S. dollar was also helping Canada's currency
strengthen. [FRX/]
 Adam Cole, global head of FX strategy at RBC Capital

C$1.0300 to C$1.0420 to the U.S. dollar for now, and a break of

 * Gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus appropriate
 * Pound still competitive vs euro

(Adds quotes from question and answer session)
 By David Milliken
 READING, England, July 13 (Reuters) - Bank of England
inflation hawk Andrew Sentance said on Tuesday policymakers
should start raising interest rates because economic conditions
were improving but any increase should occur only gradually.
 Sentance, who last month became the first member of the
Monetary Policy Committee to vote for a rate hike since August
2008, said the path to economic recovery could be uneven but
that did not equate to a risk of a double-dip recession.
 ""I favour a gradual rise in Bank Rate which would be aimed
to avoid destabilising confidence through a sudden lurch in
policy,"" Sentance told a business audience in Reading.
 ""'Tightening' may be technically correct as the opposite of
'loosening' but it implies that monetary policy might become
objectively tight and restrain the growth of the economy
significantly. Again, that is not my view about the policy
stance we currently need.""
 In a question and answer session, Sentance described
Britain's current monetary policy setting as ""quite an extreme""
one that was no longer warranted.
 ""In a sense, it's the patient coming out of intensive care
and into the recovery ward, and looking at adjusting what the
medication might need to be,"" he said.
 The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low
of 0.5 percent and embarked on a 200 billion pound ($300
billion) asset purchase programme last March when Britain was in
the depths of recession and policymakers feared it would succumb
to deflation.
 But since hitting a 5-year low of 1.1 percent in September
2009, inflation has been climbing and has been above the central
bank's 2 percent target for the last seven months. 
 Rising public inflation expectations could impede the slow
fall in inflation which has recently started, Sentance said.
 ""If the recovery continues and headline inflation remains
relatively high, there may be a further upward drift in pay
growth in the private sector, offsetting some of the downward
pressure from (limited) wage growth in the public sector.""
 Sentance said the downside risks to the economy and
inflation that had forced the BoE to drastically loosen policy
had been avoided and there was now evidence in wages that spare
capacity was not having as big a downward impact as expected.
 ""A year ago, the predominant worry was that inflation could
be significantly depressed by the impact of the recession. That
risk did not materialise,"" he said. 
 ""And while I'm not yet worried that we face a major and
serious risk in the opposite direction, I do think we need to
adjust the policy settings we put in place.""
 One factor feeding into the recent inflation spike was the
weak pound, Sentance said, and there was reason to believe that
ultra-loose policy and the expectation that rates would remain
at their record low for some time had contributed to that.
 Sentance said sterling remained at a relatively competitive
level against the euro, despite the single currency's drift off
its peaks in the first half of this year.
 ""While I wouldn't want to make a forecast, I think it is
important to see that move in the euro ... moving to a more
competitive level as something that could be supportive for the
European economy,"" he said.
 ""After all there are some big exporting European economies.
We've also seen that with the pound against the euro, we are
still I think in a long term sense in a quite competitive
position versus our European counterparts.""

(Adds details, quotes, background)
 By Nelson Banya
 HARARE, July 13 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's government is
targeting economic growth of 5.4 percent this year, President
Robert Mugabe said on Tuesday, down from earlier forecasts as
the economy struggles to attract crucial donor support.
 The economy grew by 5.7 percent last year, the first annual
expansion in a decade, after Mugabe formed a unity government
with long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai, now prime minister.
 Finance Minister Tendai Biti, who will on Wednesday present
a mid-term budget statement, had initially forecast 7.7 percent
expansion this year on the back of stronger output from the
mining sector and expected inflows from foreign donors.
 ""Government will continue to prioritise the need to
galvanise the economic growth momentum to achieve a 5.4 percent
growth by the end of the year and go beyond that in 2011,""
Mugabe said when he officially opened Zimbabwe's parliament.
 Western donors are demanding more political and economic
reforms from Zimbabwe before releasing any fresh funds.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned in May that
growth would slow significantly this year unless the government
took corrective measures to repair the economy.
 Mugabe said the government was in talks with lenders to
secure additional funds. Zimbabwe's foreign debt was estimated
by the IMF to stand at $7.1 billion or 162 percent of gross
domestic product at the end of 2009.
 ""Government continues to re-engage the international
financial institutions over the country's debt with a view to
reaching some agreement so as to unlock new financing,"" Mugabe
said.
 
 DIAMOND BOOST
 Mugabe, 86 and in power since Zimbabwe won independence from
Britain in 1980, said the mining sector was expected to grow by
more than 20 percent as a result of higher mineral prices and as
mothballed mines continue to re-open and expand.
 Diamond output was set to be a major driver of economic
recovery, Mugabe said, although he accused Western countries of
seeking to prevent Zimbabwe selling diamonds from the
government's Marange fields.
 Regulators from the Kimberley Process, a certification
scheme set up to prevent the diamond trade being used to finance
diamonds, are divided over whether to allow Zimbabwe to sell
gemstones from Marange, where rights groups accuse the military
of carrying out abuses against thousands of illegal miners.
 ""Those ill-disposed to us have not given up on the use of
absurd conditionalities and other dilatory tactics in a bid to
block the sale of our diamonds,"" Mugabe said.
 ""Let there be no doubt whatsoever about our resolve to sell
our diamonds for the benefit of our country and her people.""
 Zimbabwe's Mines Minister has previously said the government
has stockpiled more than 4 million carats of diamonds worth $1.7
billion, which is equivalent to the 2010 national budget.

 By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday
after a smooth Greek treasury bill auction helped ease some
concerns about Europe's debt crisis and took some of the sting
out of another credit rating downgrade for Portugal.
 A strong start to U.S. corporate earnings season also
boosted general appetite for risk, traders said, while data
showing the U.S. trade deficit widened unexpectedly in May
weighed on the dollar.
 Sterling, meanwhile, rose after hotter-than-expected
inflation data left investors betting that the Bank of England
may have to start thinking about higher interest rates.
 ""The dollar is getting hurt across the board today on a
combination of things, including better earnings and a wider
U.S. trade gap,"" said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at
Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""On the euro, that's
ratcheted us back to the upper third of recent ranges.""
 The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.2630 after slipping to a
one-week low of $1.2523 in European trade after Moody's
Investors Service cut Portugal's rating by two notches.
 It began to recover after Greece sold 1.625 billion euros
($2.03 billion) of 6-month T-bills at a better rate than it
pays to borrow under an EU/IMF rescue fund.
 A strong response to a Spanish debt auction had taken the
euro to a two-month high of $1.2723 last Friday.
 Traders said euro gains would likely hit offers around
$1.2640 from range of players who bought the euro on its way
down in earlier European trade.
 Earlier, a major U.S. bank was seen protecting a short-term
option barrier at $1.25. Asian buyers were also reported in
that area.
 Sterling rose 0.8 percent to $1.5140, off a session low
beneath $1.50, after quarterly consumer price inflation
remained above the Bank of England's 2 percent target rate.
 The dollar also fell 0.3 percent to 88.38 yen, moving
further away from gains booked a day ago after Japan's ruling
party suffered a stinging defeat in parliamentary elections.
 UNWELCOME TRADE REMINDER
 A wider-than-expected May U.S. trade deficit also raised
some concern about U.S. growth and renewed focus on the United
States' own budget concerns, analysts said.
 ""It's a long-term trend that's been out of the spotlight
for a while but this reminds everyone that it's a major
negative still hanging over the dollar,"" Dolan said.
 Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange, Inc, said the number ""could detract precious
percentage points from second-quarter GDP, and in that respect
may be mildly negative for the dollar.""
 However, markets still expect the U.S. economy to outpace
its counterparts in Europe and Japan when it comes to growth,
which should continue to support the dollar against the euro.
 Better-than-expected earnings from Alcoa Inc on Monday
helped support that case, and investors are waiting for reports
from Intel Corp, JPMorgan Chase and General Electric this
week.
 ""The dollar had recently pulled back from its earlier
rally, but we're still in very favorable ranges,"" said John
Doyle, strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 Key resistance for the euro was seen around $1.2687, the
trendline from the December high.
 ""While capped by $1.2687, our stance will be negative,""
Commerzbank technical analysts said in a note to clients.

 WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit
widened unexpectedly in May, led by a big jump in imports from
China that helped overpower the best month for U.S. exports
since September 2008, a government report showed on Tuesday.
 The rise in imports shown by the Commerce Department report
suggested domestic demand was holding up better than some had
feared. But with more of that demand being sated by overseas
products, the widening trade deficit is expected to weigh on
U.S. gross domestic product.
 ""On the margin, a growing deficit could detract precious
percentage points from second-quarter GDP and in that respect may
be mildly negative for the dollar,"" said Omer Esiner, chief
market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc in
Washington.
 The trade gap widened 4.8 percent to $42.3 billion, the
largest since November 2008, defying a consensus Wall Street
forecast for it to narrow in May to $39.0 billion.
 U.S. imports rose 2.9 percent to the highest since October
2008, led by a 12.1 percent increase in shipments from China
and stronger U.S demand for consumer goods, autos and capital
goods.
 The big jump in imports from China is consistent with that
country's own trade data, which showed exports rising sharply
in May and June from year-ago levels.
 It also gives China's critics in Congress new ammunition to
argue that Beijing is not allowing its currency, known as either
the yuan or renminbi, to rise in value fast enough.
 The yuan has risen 0.80 percent since Beijing loosened from
a peg to the dollar on June 19.
 But a number of U.S. lawmakers say it is undervalued by 25
percent to 40 percent, giving Chinese exporters an unfair
advantage. They are vowing to move forward with legislation,
after the Obama administration declined in a semi-annual report
last week to formally name China a currency manipulator.
 U.S. exports had their best showing since September 2008,
when world trade was in the early stages of a deep plunge as a
result of the global financial crisis.
The 2.4 percent rise in U.S. exports in May reflected big
gains for industrial supplies and materials and capital goods
and smaller rises for autos and consumer goods.
A slight drop in the average price for imported oil to
$76.93 per barrel helped keep the monthly trade gap from
widening further. U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia and other
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
were down about 10 percent in May.
 U.S. financial markets mostly shrugged off the trade data.
Stock index futures were little changed after the report. U.S.
Treasury debt prices trimmed losses and the U.S. dollar rose
slightly against the yen.

 * Turkey second after China in foreign construction revenue
 
 By Simon Cameron-Moore
 ASTANA, July 13 (Reuters) - Turkish President Abdullah Gul
likes to walk, and where he goes, businessmen often follow.
 Gul likes the idea, probably more than his bodyguards, that
the leader of a country whose foreign policy goal is to have no
enemies and do business wherever it can is an unlikely target
for anyone other than Kurdish militants back home.
 On a midnight stroll with his entourage along the peaceful
boulevards of Kazakhstan's new capital, Astana, he recalled a
trip to Afghanistan in 2007.
 ""I was walking in Kabul without anyone bothering me,"" Gul
told Reuters. ""On the same day, (U.S. vice-president) Dick
Cheney was stuck at the air base after a bomb attack there that
killed over 20 people.""
 Who knows whether the Turkish road builders and construction
contractors will ever make it big in Afghanistan, but the Turks'
""go anywhere"" attitude has paid off elsewhere.
 Encouraged by their government's diplomatic offensive to
cultivate relations outside the West, they have made inroads in
the Middle East and Africa, the Balkans and former Soviet bloc.
 Success-hungry entrepreneurs from the boondocks of eastern
Turkey have been dubbed the ""Anatolian Tigers"", and their
ambition has helped Turkey become the world's 17th largest
economy, with a GDP of $780 billion.
 They have prospered under the pro-business policies of Prime
Minister Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, a socially conservative
party that sees itself as a Muslim version of Europe's Christian
Democrats and has led Turkey since 2002.
 Nowhere is there more concrete evidence of Turkish presence
than in the energy-rich former Soviet republics stretching from
the Caspian Sea to Central Asia, the ancestral lands of nomadic
Turks who invaded Anatolia a millennium ago.
 
 SUCCESS STORY
 Visiting Astana to mark the 70th birthday of Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Gul enthused over the
astonishing architecture in what some people jokingly call a
""Lego city"" on the steppe.
 His pride stemmed from the fact that Turks built most of it.
 A dramatic shopping mall designed in the style of a giant
nomadic yurt and called ""the King of Tents"" was opened on
Nazarbayev's birthday, courtesy of Turkish hotelier and
construction magnate Fettah Tamince and his partners.
 Tamince chairs the Rixos hotel chain, operator of the
six-star hotel where Gul stayed in Astana.
 Nazarbayev asked Tamince if he could open it in time for a
regional summit in 2005.
 ""I told the president: 'Give me your word that there'll be
no bureaucracy, and we can do it',"" Tamince said. ""He saw what
we could do and kept us. I've done a lot of investment here.""
 Aside from the mall and hotel, Tamince's Sembol Construction
has built a university, a sports stadium, a convention centre
and an outlandish pyramid that contains an underground opera
house and hosts a congress of world religions every three years.
 Tamince says his firms now generate $1.6 billion annually,
including $1.1 billion from construction, most of it abroad. He
is currently building hotels in Dubai and Vienna.
 Just 38, fit and shaven-headed, Tamince says he's reading
the autobiography of flamboyant British tycoon Richard Branson.
But his own odyssey could fill a book too.
 At 14, he says, he left his poor home town on Turkey's
border with Iran, where ""it snows for eight months, rains for
two and is summer for two"", and went to the Mediterranean resort
of Antalya, where he sold carpets to tourists.
 When he was 18 he bought a car and drove to Switzerland.
Later he moved to Germany, where he made enough money to go into
real estate back in Turkey.
 
 OLDER GENERATION
 A listening diplomat says he knows of dozens of success
stories among Turkish businessmen in the 'Stans, where people
speak different strains of the Turkic family of languages.
 Today, Turks account for 60 percent of the construction
market in Kazakhstan, and in Turkmenistan the figure is 90
percent. It is a similar story in Azerbaijan, Gul's aides say.
 They cite surveys showing that, in terms of revenues
generated abroad, Turkey's construction and contracting industry
has overtaken the United States' to stand second to China's.
 Turkish firms expect the value of projects they are involved
in to exceed $25 billion this year.
 While Tamince belongs to a new generation, Turkish
businessmen who arrived in the 1990s helped to fill an
entrepreneurial void left by decades of communism.
 Turkish businessmen stole a march in Central Asia after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, thanks to the foresight of
then-president Turgut Ozal, who swiftly put up money for trade
with the newly independent but almost bankrupt states.
 ""It was the first oxygen to the economy,"" recalled Ahmet
Hamdi Ayan, who arrived in Kazakhstan in 1992. He remembers
foreigners arriving in the old capital Almaty without a decent
place to stay or eat. ""You were lucky if you got black bread.""
 Ayan's answer was to build and run the Intercontinental
hotel. Today his Ahsel Group has a turnover of close to $400
million, employs 6,000 people, mainly in construction. He has
won contracts in Astana to build the parliament, a 22-storey
business centre, and a stunningly designed national library.
 
 MAKING CONNECTIONS
 Swapping stories over a barbecue dinner in the gardens of
the Rixos hotel, Ahmet Calik, billionaire chairman of Calik
Holding, struck a common theme.
 ""Turkish companies played a huge, positive role in these
countries,"" he said. ""Now they have made big progress ... and
we're grateful to the governments who trusted us.""
 Saparmurat Niyazov, the late Turkmen autocrat, trusted the
quietly spoken mogul so much that he made him a minister.
 ""Our group had done more than 100 projects in Turkmenistan,""
Calik recounted. ""We built all the power plants in Turkmenistan.
As a group we built eight gas-fired power plants.""
 Having arrived in Turkmen capital of Ashgabat in the 1990s
looking for deals in cotton, Calik has wound up with a business
empire spanning energy, telecommunications and finance.
 Calik, who took over the pro-government Sabah media group
and ATV television channel in Turkey in 2007, says his group
employs 20,000 people in a dozen countries. He says half its
revenues come from outside Turkey.
 Calik Energy is now building a $4 billion trans-Anatolian
pipeline, along with Italy's ENI , to take oil from the
Black Sea to the Mediterranean. The oil is expected to be
supplied by ENI's holding in Kazakh oil fields.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2010 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. trade gap widens unexpectedly in May," WASHINGTON, July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit
widened unexpectedly in May, led by a big jump in imports from
China that helped overpower the best month for U.S. exports
since September 2008, a government report showed on Tuesday.
The trade gap widened 4.8 percent to $42.3 billion, the
largest since November 2008, defying a consensus Wall Street
forecast for it to narrow in May to $39.0 billion.
 U.S. imports rose 2.9 percent to the highest since October
2008, led by a 12.1 percent increase in shipments from China
and stronger U.S demand for consumer goods, autos and capital
goods.
The big jump in imports from China is consistent with that
country's own trade data, which showed exports rising sharply
in May and June from year-ago levels. 
U.S. exports had their best showing since September 2008,
when world trade was in the early stages of a deep plunge as a
result of the global financial crisis.
The 2.4 percent rise in U.S. exports in May reflected big
gains for industrial supplies and materials and capital goods
and smaller rises for autos and consumer goods.
A slight drop in the average price for imported oil to
$76.93 per barrel helped keep the monthly trade gap from
widening further. U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia and other
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
were down about 10 percent in May.

 By George Georgiopoulos
 ATHENS, July 13 (Reuters) - Greece passed its first
borrowing test on Tuesday since a giant EU/IMF funding deal in
May, sending bank stocks and the euro higher after it easily
sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.03 billion) of 6-month T-bills.
 The debt-ridden country managed to get market funding at a
slightly cheaper cost than the 5.0 percent it pays to borrow
under the 110 billion euro loan that the European Union and
International Monetary Fund put in place to calm a crisis that
has shaken the euro zone.
 But the auction highlighted Greece still had some way to go
in convincing investors. The yield was higher than a previous
similar sale and what other troubled euro zone economies have
paid recently, and demand, while solid, was lower.
""We were expecting a good result, and it's good for Greece
and the euro, but (Greece) has a long way to travel, as its
economic challenges are pretty severe. It's going to take years
to figure this out, not just one auction,"" said Paul Robinson, a
currency strategist at Barclays Capital in London.
 Less oversubscribed than a previous auction in April, the
sale produced a yield of 4.65 percent versus 4.55 percent in an
April 13 sale of similar duration paper, the outcome broadly in
line with expectations.
 Tuesday's bid-to-cover ratio was slightly better than
forecast at 3.64 -- though less than half the 7.67 times
oversubscription in the previous April auction.
 ""We are happy with the outcome of the auction,"" debt agency
(PDMA) chief Petros Christodoulou told Reuters. ""We were
pleasantly surprised with the foreign participation.""
 Markets had expected the issue would be mostly picked up by
Greek banks. Christodoulou would not elaborate on how much was
taken up by foreigners.
 
 COSTLY BORROWING
 Punished for fiscal profligacy, Greece is paying for
six-month paper 8 times what it costs Germany to borrow for one
year, highlighting the struggle it faces to restore market
confidence.
 It is also paying much higher costs than other euro zone
periphery countries facing fiscal problems although their costs
have also been rising.
 Portugal sold six-month T-bills at 1.947 percent on July 7,
while Spain had to pay a yield of 1.577 percent on June 22 for
six-month paper.
 ""It's a marginally positive result. It could have gone
worse. On the other hand, Greece is sheltered from any fiscal
default over at least the next six months, or two years,"" said
Citigroup economist Giada Gianni.
 ""Since it's a very short-term maturity, it does not reflect
markets' expectations in terms of Greece's development in the
next years. It's very difficult to say whether it reflects
market confidence in Greece,"" she said.
 Still, being able to tap markets for six-month funds was
enough to give battered Greek bank shares a boost, driving the
sector's index 4.5 percent higher with the euro gaining some
ground against the dollar.
 The debt agency accepted an additional 375 million euros in
non-competitive bids, bringing total proceeds to 1.625 billion
euros to roll over maturing short-term paper. Settlement date is
July 16.
 Another auction of three-month paper will follow next week
to roll over 2.4 billion euros of maturing T-bills.

 That coincided with worries the United States was heading

 * Commission says proposals won't affect GM approvals
 * Proposals face opposition from some EU governments
 (Adds details, quotes, reactions)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuters) - The European Union's executive
adopted proposals on Tuesday to allow member states to ban the
cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops, despite strong
opposition from industry and some EU governments.
 ""We are basically giving much more flexibility to member
states to restrict the cultivation of GMOs in their countries,""
EU Health and Consumer Affairs Commissioner John Dalli said at a
news press conference in Brussels.
 The proposals confirmed a twin-track approach set out in
drafts seen by Reuters in June, with an amendment to EU rules on
GM cultivation accompanied by non-binding guidelines designed to
introduce the change immediately.
 Those drafts said giving countries the freedom to ban GM
crops would unblock the EU's GM approval system, which could
lead to a rise in GM crop plantings in countries already growing
them such as Spain and the Czech Republic.
 But all references to speeding up EU GM approvals were
removed from the final proposals, and Dalli denied that the
Commission had proposed the change in order to convince
sceptical member states to approve new GM varieties.
""I don't expect countries to change their voting patterns,""
the Maltese commissioner told journalists.
 ""We will not be using this as leverage in any way to get
more positive decisions.""
 
 STRONG OPPOSITION
 In order to pass, the proposed legislative amendment will
need the approval of EU lawmakers and a qualified majority of
member states under the bloc's weighted voting system.
 But ministers from several EU countries including France and
Spain have already criticised the proposals for seeking to
dismantle the 27-nation bloc's common policy on GM crops.
 ""We hope that decisions will continue to be taken at
community level. We don't support the renationalisation of (GM)
decisions,"" French Farm Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists
in Brussels on Monday.
 Environmental campaigners Greenpeace and Friends of the
Earth said the proposals were an attempt to open Europe's fields
to GM crops. EU farm lobby Copa-Cogeca said the plans would
create new legal and commercial risks for farmers.
 Biotech companies meanwhile have warned that the proposals
will create legal uncertainty and disrupt the EU's single market
for agricultural goods, resulting in a slew of internal market
disputes and legal challenges.
 But Dalli insisted that the proposals would give greater
legal certainty to companies and governments, and said a legal
review of the plans had revealed no contradiction with World
Trade Organisation rules.
 
 NEXT STEPS
 The non-binding guidelines on the co-existence of GM and
non-GM crops take immediate effect, and allow countries to set
technical requirements for GM farming that would effectively
prohibit it from whole regions and countries.
 Until the legislative change is adopted -- which Dalli said
could take some time -- the Commission will continue to apply
the existing legislation on GM cultivation.
 He will present the legislative proposals to EU lawmakers in
the parliament's environment committee later on Tuesday, and ask
them to limit their debate to the proposed legal change, rather
than open up the bloc's whole GM legislation for review.
 The Commission will brief governments on the plans in
October, and EU environment ministers will hold their first
detailed discussion on the proposals on December 20, according
to the agenda of the Belgian EU Presidency.
 Dalli hinted that a more comprehensive revision of the EU's
GM legislation could happen in 2012, once an external evaluation
of the bloc's policies and a review of the environmental risk
assessment for GMOs are both complete.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2010 06:52AM ET</span>","Sterling climbs, UK CPI stays above BoE target","* Sterling climbs after data shows UK inflation risks remain
* Pound recovers from early losses after S&P ratings warning
* Investors await speech by BoE's Sentance
 
 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Sterling rose on Tuesday,
shaking off early losses as investors speculated that data
showing stubbornly high UK inflation would add fuel to the
argument that interest rates may have to rise.
 Official figures showed that annual consumer price inflation
came in at 3.2 percent in June, lower than 3.4 percent in May.
Despite the slide, year-on-year CPI stayed above the Bank of
England's 2.0 percent target rate..
 At the same time, core CPI, which excludes prices for
energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose 3.1 percent year-on-year
from 2.9 percent in May.
 Analysts said the data helped to boost sterling on the view
that higher price risks may require the BoE to raise rates
earlier than expected by the market, which sees the central bank
starting to tighten in the second quarter of 2011.
 ""The figures will give strength to people like Andrew
Sentance, who would argue that the UK is running the risk that
inflation expectations will be de-anchored and will become a
problem in the medium term,"" said Paul Robinson, currency
strategist at Barclays Capital.
 Sentance, a member of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee,
last month argued for a 25 basis point rise in rates from a
record low of 0.5 percent due to rising inflation risks, and is
expected to have done so again this month.
 Investors were waiting to see if Sentance would address the
latest CPI figures when he delivers a speech at 1230 GMT.
 By 1024 GMT, sterling traded 0.4 percent higher on the day
at $1.5082, after rising to the day's high of $1.5118. It was
well off a session trough of $1.4965 hit in early trade.
 It recovered from a slide to $1.4949 on Monday, its lowest
since the start of the month, after ratings agency Standard &
Poor's warned that the UK remained in danger of losing its
triple-A rating due to its large debts.
 A 1.4 percent rise in UK shares on the back of a strong
start to the U.S. earnings season also helped sterling to
recover from its earlier slide.
 
 GAINS VS EURO
 Sterling gains pushed the euro down 0.4 percent to 83.40
pence, not far from the day's low of 83.16 pence.
 The euro had come under selling pressure after Moody's
ratings agency downgraded Portugal to A1 from AA2.
 But it trimmed some losses after Greece managed to sell
six-month Treasury bills to the market in its first debt offer
since securing emergency loans in May.
 Investors brushed off data earlier in the day from Britain's
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, whose house price
balance fell to an 11-month low of +9 from a downwardly revised
+21 in May, reflecting weaker demand and increasing supply..
 Other figures showed that UK retail sales rose 1.2 percent
in June from the previous month, their best showing since March.
 Despite its broad gains, sterling's rise was capped as some
investors worried that the economy may suffer if rates were to
rise earlier than expected.
 The economic impact of fiscal belt-tightening measures
planned by the new UK government also kept sterling's gains in
check.
 BoE policymaker Adam Posen said on Monday the UK may slip
back into recession in part due to looming fiscal austerity and
problems in the euro zone.
 Figures on Monday showed the UK current account deficit
widened to 9.628 billion pounds in the first quarter, far
exceeding forecasts of a 4.70-billion-pound gap.
 A final reading of first-quarter GDP showed the economy grew
by 0.3 percent from the previous quarter, unchanged from an
initial reading, but raised concerns that the economy may suffer
as austerity measures kick in.

 SEOUL, July 13 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's said on
Tuesday there was no need to imminently downgrade Japan's
sovereign credit ratings after the ruling party's weak showing
in weekend elections complicated efforts to cut public debt.
 In a statement on Monday, S&P said it might lower Japan's
ratings if the government's fiscal position is eroded further
or the government fails to come up with concrete measures aimed
at fiscal consolidation.
 However, S&P officials said on Tuesday the election result,
which could lead to policy gridlock and so make it more
difficult for the ruling party to execute tax reform, did not
mean a ratings downgrade was imminent.
 ""It adds one more complication but not a critical one,"" Kim
Eng Tan, a Singapore-based sovereign analyst at S&P, told
Reuters in an interview in Seoul. ""So I don't think it requires
urgently a downgrade.""
 David Beers, London-based managing director of S&P
sovereign and international public finance ratings, also said:
""I don't think it clearly makes it more probable. I think we
will take stock over the next couple of weeks and months and
see.""
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan's ruling coalition lost its upper
house majority in the election at the weekend, putting his
proposed policies to deal with debt and generate growth at
risk.
 His Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) still controls the more
powerful lower house. But it needs help from other parties to
push bills through the upper chamber in the struggle to end
years of stagnation in the world's No.2 economy and start to
reduce public debt that is twice the size of the economy.
 ""If nothing else this is just a kind of another impediment
in the way of the process of this government beginning to deal
with the fiscal issue, because it's possible that the nature of
the coalition will be readjusted somewhat,"" Beers said.
 ""I think we will be inclined to watch and wait a while and
see how this political crisis unfolds. It does add another
complication on the policy issues.""
 In its statement on Monday, S&P said a hung parliament is
the most likely outcome of the election, making it difficult
for policies to be implemented.
 ""As such, structural reforms, including those of the public
sector and public pension system, and increases in the
consumption tax rate will be difficult to implement in the new
political landscape, and thus, potentially act as a negative
factor on the sovereign ratings,"" it said.
 S&P rates Japan's long-term local and foreign currency debt
at AA, both with a negative outlook.

 ATHENS, July 13 (Reuters) - Greece easily sold 1.625 billion
euros ($2.03 billion) of 6-month T-bills on Tuesday, passing its
first borrowing test since securing a giant 110 billion euro
EU/IMF emergency funding deal in May, but yields stayed high.
 Greece managed to get funding from markets at a slightly

 ""We are happy with the outcome of the auction,"" debt agency
chief Petros Christodoulou told Reuters. ""We were pleasantly
surprised with the foreign participation."" He would not
elaborate.
 Less oversubscribed than a previous auction in April, the
auction produced a yield of 4.65 percent versus 4.55 percent in
an April 13 sale of similar duration paper.
 The outcome of the auction was broadly in line with
expectations in terms of yield and the bid-to-cover ratio was
slightly better than forecast at 3.64 -- though lower than the
7.67 in the previous April auction.
Greece is paying much higher costs than other euro zone
periphery countries facing fiscal problems although their costs
have also been rising.
 Portugal sold six-month T-bills at 1.947 percent on July 7,
while Spain had to pay a yield of 1.5777 percent on June 22 for
six-month paper.
 The debt agency accepted an additional 375 million euros in

 * Move follows big trade deal between China and Taiwan
 * Dovetails with push to promote use of yuan outside China
 BEIJING, July 13 (Reuters) - China is further promoting the
reach of its currency beyond its borders by authorising the
Hong Kong arm of Bank of China to provide yuan cash settlement
services for Taiwan banks operating in the territory.
 The announcement, by the People's Bank of China, comes
weeks after the signing of a landmark trade deal between Taiwan
and China, which claims sovereignty over the self-ruled island.
 (For full coverage of the trade deal, see [ID:nECFA])
 ""The arrangement will facilitate travel across the Taiwan
Strait and lay the foundations for a cross-strait currency
settlement mechanism and enhanced cross-strait cooperation on
currency administration,"" the central bank said.
 Taiwan government officials have said the advantage of the
scheme announced on Tuesday is that local banks will be able to
procure yuan notes more cheaply for their retail customers and
reduce the number of fake notes in circulation.
 ""Bank of China (HK) can stably provide RMB cash to these
two Taiwan banks,"" said Chou A-ting, a deputy governor of
Taiwan's central bank, told a news conference in Taipei.
 Chou was referring to state-owned Bank of Taiwan and
state-controlled Mega Bank, Taiwan's top two foreign exchange
banks. The yuan is also known as the renminbi (RMB).
 ""We'll submit our application as soon as possible. The new
rules will bring better bill quality and lower costs,"" said
Susan Chang, chairman of Bank of Taiwan Financial Holdings.
 Taiwan banks currently buy yuan notes in Hong Kong from
HSBC and Bank of America.
 The issue of when banks in Taiwan will be allowed to start
taking yuan deposits and provide remittance and trade
settlement services in yuan remains to be negotiated, the PBOC
said on its website, www.pbc.gov.cn.
 Two-way transfers of yuan between Taiwan and China were
equivalent to some $20 billion a year, Chou said.
 Bank of China is the clearing bank for other participants
in Hong Kong's yuan settlement programme, which the mainland
authorities are expanding to raise the profile of the currency
outside China.
 Hong Kong banks started providing yuan services to retail
clients in 2003 and to authorised businesses in 2005.
 Financial institutions were allowed to issue yuan bonds in
Hong Kong in 2007, and a scheme permitting the invoicing and
settlement of trade in yuan, rather in dollars, began a year
ago.
 The programme is gathering momentum after a slow start. For
an analysis, double-click on [ID:nSGE66502A]
 In a further illustration of the trend towards
internationalisation of the yuan, China will soon permit the
sale of yuan-denominated financial products in Hong Kong and
lift a cap on the purchase of yuan by companies in the city to
meet growing demand, newspapers said on Tuesday.

markets and ongoing euro zone debt crisis jitters.
 The three-month Euribor rate  -- traditionally

 The overall level of excess cash in money markets has more
than halved since banks paid back 442 billion euros worth of
one-year loans to the European Central Bank at the start of the

 Interbank rates have also been pushed higher on fears that
some European banks may run into trouble in the wake of the euro

 * June price index eases 0.4 pct m/m, first fall in 4 mths
 * C.S. study shows 50 pct of businesses see Q3 export growth
 
 ZURICH, July 13 (Reuters) - Swiss producer and import prices
posted the first monthly drop in four months on Tuesday but
economists said the data was unlikely to prompt the Swiss
central bank to start selling francs for euros again. 
 The Swiss National Bank last month dropped its pledge to
intervene in foreign exchange markets, saying deflation risks
had disappeared for the time being.
 However, figures published by the Federal Statistics Office
on Tuesday showed that while producer and import prices rose 0.9
percent in June from a year ago, they were 0.4 percent down from
the previous month.
 ""These numbers don't show deflation developments,"" Thomas
Herrmann, an economist at Credit Suisse, said.
 ""We think, given the relatively good economic recovery,
which is weakening but nevertheless continuing, that the SNB
wants to get away from its policy of foreign exchange
interventions."" 
 The franc, which investors regard as a safe haven currency,
rallied against the euro and reached an all-time high on July 1
after the central bank stopped selling francs for euros and
allowed the market to determine the exchange rate. 
 The SNB had intervened in the market for more than a year to
prevent the franc from climbing too much against the euro and
causing deflationary risks. Weak consumer price data last week
prompted talk the SNB could resume its intervention.
 Swissmem, the machine and electrical industry lobby, has
warned the stronger currency could hamper exports. But a Credit
Suisse study of small and medium-sized companies released on
Tuesday showed the prospects for exports should remain
favourable in the coming months.
 Credit Suisse said foreign demand for Swiss products was at
a positive level not seen since mid-2008 and that 50 percent of
the small and medium-sized businesses questioned expected a rise
in exports in the third quarter.

a ruling over European planemaker Airbus's bid to supply tankers
to the United States was politically-motivated and that he wants
to talk to U.S. Trade Representrative Ron Kirk about it.
 EU Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht said he believed a
World Trade Organisation ruling late last month that state
subsidies had given Airbus an advantage over U.S. rival Boeing
was one sided.
 De Gucht told Germany's Handelsblatt business daily the
ruling was being used against Airbus in its bid for a contract
worth up to $50 billion for new tankers for the U.S. Air Force.
 ""The WTO panel on Airbus is being used against us
politically in Washington, for example with the tanker deal for
the U.S. Air Force,"" he told the newspaper. ""That is a problem,
and I want to talk to Kirk about it.""
 A group of U.S. lawmakers has demanded that the Air Force
factor the WTO ruling into their decision on the tanker
competition.
 WTO judges said late last month the EU must axe prohibited
export subsidies to Airbus which had injured Boeing.
 The WTO panel concluded Airbus had been able to launch a
series of passenger jets only thanks to subsidies from the EU
and member states Britain, France, Germany and Spain, without
which it would be a very different and much weaker company.
 ""Everyone knows that Boeing worked similarly to Airbus,"" de
Gucht said. ""Instead of state aid, there were billions of
military or civilian research contracts there. We expect the WTO
will recognise that by September at the latest.""

hint of striking a deal on Argentine soyoil imports on Tuesday,
despite President Cristina Fernandez saying she expected to
resolve the trade dispute within days.
 Fenandez, who is visiting Beijing and will travel to
Shanghai later in the week, said on Monday a deal would come
within two or three days. [ID:nN12214427]
 But later she cancelled a news conference called for Tuesday
evening in Beijing.
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang, asked by
Reuters about progress in the talks, gave no timeframe.
 ""The soybean oil import dispute is a normal problem in the
trade development of the two countries. I believe with the
mutual beneficial and win-win spirit, the two sides will
definitely find a proper solution through friendly
negotiations,"" he said.
 He said Argentina was an important partner for China in
South America.
 China's quarantine bureau said in a brief statement that its
head, Wang Yong, had met with Argentina's minister of
agriculture, animal husbandry and fishery and talked over
bilateral trade on farm products and cooperation on quarantine
and inspection.
 It did not mention soyoil.
 Quarantine bureau officials reached by Reuters said they are
not ware of any agreement with Argentina.
 One trading executive with a state-owned trading house said:
""We have not received any confirmation from the Chinese side
(about a resolution of the issue),"" despite premiums of
Argentine soyoil picking up on hopes of a deal.
 He said companies are still keen for soyoil from the United
States, and an immediate resolution of the issue could prompt
some to cancel expensive soyoil cargoes from United States.
 The Chinese freeze has threatened a hard-currency earner
for Argentina. Last year, the country exported 1.84 million
tonnes of soyoil to China, bringing in $1.4 billion and
accounting for 77 percent of Chinese soyoil imports.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro recovered on Tuesday
after Greece successfully returned to capital markets for the
first time since late April, while global equities advanced
after Alcoa delivered a strong start to the earnings season.
 Athens sold 1.625 billion euros ($2 billion) of six-month
Treasury bills, passing its first borrowing test since securing
a 110 billion euro EU/IMF emergency funding deal in May.
[ID:nLDE66C0DH]
 ""We were expecting a good result, and it's good for Greece
and the euro, but Greece has a long way to travel, as its
economic challenges are pretty severe,"" said Paul Robinson, FX
strategist at Barclays Capital.
 ""It's going to take years for Greece to figure this out, not
just one auction,"" he said.
 The euro recouped earlier losses against the dollar 
to trade steady at $1.2583, shrugging off Moody's Investors
Service's two-notch downgrade of Portugal's debt rating.
 The impact of the downgrade to A1 was limited because rival
agency Standard & Poor's already rates Portugal a further two
notches lower, at A-minus. [ID:nLDE66C0FN]
 The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 88.41 yen . Against
a basket of major currencies, the greenback steadied. <.DXY>

 Bund futures  extended losses after the Greek
auction results. The September contract was last 37 ticks lower
at 128.87.
 However, Portugal's borrowing costs rose after the Moody's
downgrade. The Portuguese yield spread over Bunds 
 widened to 291 basis points, around 5 bps wider
compared with Monday's settlement close.
 
 STOCKS HIGHER
 World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.4 percent, helped by aluminium group
Alcoa's  stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.
 Alcoa's results boded well for the U.S. earnings season and
offset concerns over China's growth after Beijing said it has no
plans to relax tougher property measures any time soon.
 Beijing said it would continue to rein in speculation in the
country's booming property sector, dampening talk that it was
relaxing credit controls.
 The comments weighed on Chinese stocks <.SSEC> as well as
the Australian dollar , which is seen as a proxy of
Chinese growth.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index gained 1.6
percent, also helped by rises in shares of oil major BP .
 ""What we have generally seen over the last few days are
traders betting that the U.S. earning season will be a fruitful
one and are therefore cherry picking stocks that to them may
look cheap,"" said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index in
London.
 U.S. stock index futures    rose 0.5 to
0.7 percent, indicating a firmer start for Wall Street.
 The MSCI All-Country World Index gained more than 5 percent
last week to post its best weekly rise in a year, though it is
still down 5.9 percent in 2010.
It carried a one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio of

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Tuesday
after ratings agency Moody's downgraded Portugal, exacerbating
concerns over peripheral euro zone debt ahead of a Greek T-Bill
auction.
 Moody's cut Portugal's debt rating by two notches to A1 with
a stable outlook, saying the government's financial strength was
likely to weaken over the near-term.
 ""The downgrade is going to weigh on the euro in the short
term and doesn't bode well ahead of the bank stress tests due
next week,"" said David Tinsley, economist at NAB Capital.
 The single currency fell around 40 ticks against the dollar
to the day's low of $1.2523 and hit a session low against the
pound at 83.51 pence.
 Traders said range players were buyers around the lows, the
same accounts then looking to sell around $1.2640. Asian buyers
were also reported in the $1.2500 region, while real-money
accounts were layering bids from $1.2490.
 Debt-laden Greece returns to capital markets for the first
time since late April, seeking to raise 1.25 billion euros
through a sale of six-month Treasury bills. Results are expected
between 0930 and 1000 GMT.
 ""There is short-term event risk for the euro this morning
with the Greek T-Bill auction. The euro could come under
short-term pressure if they are forced to pay a high yield,""
said Paul Mackel, director of currency strategy at HSBC.
 Key resistance for the euro was seen around $1.2687, the
trendline from the December high.
""While capped by $1.2687, our stance will be negative,""
Commerzbank technical analysts said in a note to clients. 
A robust response to a Spanish debt auction earlier this
month saw the euro rally to two-month highs. That coincided with
worries the United States was heading towards a double-dip
recession, sending the greenback to its lowest in nearly two
months against a basket of currencies.
 Those concerns have taken a back seat, but traders said real
money investors and margin traders were still cautious, given
lingering worries about a global slowdown.
 
 DOLLAR INDEX
 The dollar index was up 0.3 percent at 84.487 while the U.S.
currency was also a touch firmer against the yen at 88.57 yen.
 ""Dollar/yen continues to be suppressed by the options market
and 87.80 to 89.10 has us contained for now,"" said a spot trader
at a U.S. bank in London. 
 The yen struggled for most of the previous session, after
Japan's ruling Democratic Party suffered a stinging defeat in a
weekend parliamentary election, but recouped its losses during
North American trade.
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars initially benefited after Alcoa posted a
higher-than-expected profit for the second quarter on Monday.
 But those currencies later gave back gains as Shanghai
shares fell more than 1 percent, somewhat cooling risk appetite.
 Shanghai shares fell more than 2 percent at one point after
the government said it would continue to rein in speculation in
the country's red-hot property sector.

 * Policy deadlock looms after ruling party's election loss
 * Kan to seek opposition help but hurdles ahead
 * Support for Kan's govt drops, adding to woes
(Adds Kyodo opinion poll in fourth paragraph, background)
 By Yoko Nishikawa and Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, July 13 (Reuters) - Japan's government said on
Tuesday it had to press on with tax reforms to cut a huge
public debt despite a stunning election setback, and was
looking to two opposition parties to help drive policy change.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan's ruling coalition lost its upper
house majority in a weekend election, putting his policies to
deal with debt and generate growth at risk and prompting
warnings by credit rating agencies S&P and Fitch on Japan's
sovereign ratings.
 Kan has another pressing headache: a possible challenge
from rivals in his own party including powerbroker Ichiro
Ozawa, a critic of the sales tax hike proposal, ahead of a
party leadership vote in September.
 A Kyodo news agency survey showing support for Kan's
government had sunk to 36.3 percent from 43.4 percent before
the election could undermine his efforts to keep his job.
 His Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) still controls the more
powerful lower house. But it needs help from other parties to
push bills through the upper chamber in the struggle to end
decades of stagnation in the world's No.2 economy.
 ""If we don't see a credible plan come through by the end of
the year, it will send a negative signal for its rating, adding
pressure to the credit rating,"" Andrew Colquhoun, Fitch
Rating's sovereign analyst for Japan, told Reuters.
 Trying to soothe worries the election drubbing would sap
political momentum for fiscal reform, National Strategy
Minister Satoshi Arai said debate was still needed on a
possible hike in the 5 percent sales tax, one of the lowest
among major economies.
 Kan had floated the possibility of doubling the tax as a
way to bring down public debt about twice the size of the $5
trillion economy and to stave off a Greek-style debt crisis as
social security costs soar to care for an ageing population.
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda conceded that Kan's
proposal may have turned off voters in the election campaign.
 ""But we must carry out an overhaul of the tax system
including the consumption tax,"" he told a news conference.
 Most opposition parties support an eventual sales tax rise
and the Kyodo survey showed a slight majority of voters do as
well, but Kan's abrupt floating of the topic and seeming
flipflops cost the Democrats support, analysts said.
 Unlike Greece, Japan's public debt has long been financed
from its massive pool of domestic savings that mostly sits in
the banking system and is recycled into Japanese government
bonds.
 But fears are growing that the ageing population will start
drawing on those savings, forcing Japan to rely on foreign
investors to fund its debt and potentially creating market
instability.
 The change has already started and Japan's savings rate has
fallen to about 3 percent from over 10 percent a decade ago.
 The Fitch warning of the higher risk of a ratings downgrade
helped send September Japanese government bond futures to the
day's low at 141.33.
 TOUGH CHALLENGE
 In attempt to break the political deadlock, Kan told close
aides he would ask the third and fourth-biggest parties in the
upper house -- the New Komeito and pro-reform Your Party -- for
policy-based cooperation, the Yomiuri newspaper reported,
adding he was probably eyeing a formal coalition in the future.
 But Kan, in office just one month, faces a tough challenge
as the two parties have ruled out joining the government,
pointing to a period of political manoeuvring and policy
paralysis.
 Your Party, which has 11 seats in the upper house after
Sunday's poll, could cooperate with the DPJ on getting the Bank
of Japan to do more to fight deflation and on overhauling the
country's bureaucratic system.
 But the party has said it would not join the debate on a
possible sales tax increase, arguing that the government should
first focus on cutting wasteful spending.
 The Buddhist-backed New Komeito, which backs policies to
fix the pensions system and social safety net, could agree to
the debate on the sales tax but only if the government first
tackles social security reform.
 Bills at immediate risk in an extra parliament session
expected in the coming months include one to scale back postal
privatisation, sought by Kan's current small coalition partner,
the People's New Party, but opposed by the Your Party.
 Kan has a more pressing threat -- a possible challenge from
opponents in his own party including powerbroker and critic of
the sales tax hike proposal, Ichiro Ozawa, ahead of a party
leadership vote in September.
 He could reshuffle his cabinet after the vote, Jiji news
agency reported. He is already under pressure to replace his
justice minister who lost her seat in the election.

 (Adds comments, details)
 HONG KONG, July 13 (Reuters) - Japan's ruling party's poor
showing at Sunday's elections will make it more difficult for the
country to push through fiscal consolidation and a delay in a
credible plan beyond the year-end would increase the risk of a
rating downgrade, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan's ruling coalition suffered a major
blow in Sunday's upper house election, putting his policies to
deal with the country's massive debt at risk.
 ""If we don't see a credible plan come through by the end of
the year, it will send a negative signal for its rating, adding
pressure to the credit rating,"" Andrew Colquhoun, Fitch's
sovereign analyst for Japan, told Reuters.
 Fitch has rated Japan's foreign currency debt AA and its
local currency debt at AA-minus, both with a stable outlook.
 However, Colquhoun said he was not pessimistic about the
government's ability to draw up such a plan and said the public
had not turned its back on fiscal consolidation as a policy
objective.
 ""The election will make it more difficult for the government
to draw up and implement such a plan, but I am not too
pessimistic as I do not read the election results as a rejection
of fiscal consolidation,"" he said.
 This was reflected in the better showing by the main
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has said that
Japan should raise the 5 percent consumption tax to 10 percent,
he said.
 In Sunday's upper house poll, Prime Minister Naoto Kan's
ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) won 44 seats and its tiny
coalition partner none, losing their majority in parliament's
upper house. That was fewer than the 51 seats won by the LDP.
 Rival rating agency Standard & Poor's has warned it might cut
Japan's sovereign grade as the ruling party's mauling in a
weekend election posed new hurdles for Kan's plans to cut public
debt.
 Colquhoun said Japan's rating was under pressure in the
medium term from a declining domestic savings rate and this was
reflected in the recent pension fund selling of Japanese
government bonds (JGB).
 Japanese public pensions turned net sellers of JGBs for the
first time in nine years in the fiscal year that ended in March,
the Nikkei business daily said on Tuesday.
 Japan's outstanding public debt is the largest among
industrial nations, approaching twice the size of its gross
domestic product, so any indication that there will be less
investment flows into JGBs could be a worry.
 But Colquhoun said there was no financing pressure in the
near term as the domestic savings rate was still positive and
resources were being generated for JGB purchases.
 ""The banking system, pension funds and insurance companies
all have a strong appetite for JGBs, but there is a risk in the
medium term,"" he said.

 HONG KONG, July 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares surrendered
early gains on Tuesday, weighed down by Chinese stocks, which
slid on reports that Beijing will not relax tougher property
measures any time soon.
 Major European stocks, however, opened slightly higher
after Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, posted
surprisingly strong quarterly results and provided a positive
outlook for global consumption of the metal.
 The euro steadied after dropping from two-month highs as
investors awaited Greece's return to capital markets for the
first time since late April and the results of stress tests on

 But the tone was weaker in Asia, where the focus for much
of the session was on China's volatile stock market.
 China's banking regulator left few doubts that efforts to
rein in real estate speculation will remain in place despite
media reports of easing restrictions in some cities. That
helped to trigger some profit taking in Asian stocks after
three days of gains.

 The MSCI ex-Japan share index fell 0.7 percent by
mid-afternoon after an initial move higher.
 The Shanghai composite index fell 1.6 percent, bringing its
year-to-date losses to 25 percent, the poorest performing
equity market in Asia.
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.2 percent, with
strength in financial stocks offset by weakness in utilities
and energy shares, which sagged as oil prices retreated further
from $75 a barrel.
 Despite concerns that Beijing will maintain its curbs on
property speculation, bargain hunters have their eyes peeled
for opportunities in Chinese property-related stocks.
 A survey of investors by Macquarie Securities showed that
while 78 percent of respondents expected property prices to
fall by the end of March 2011, the real estate industry was the
top pick of where investors said they would increase exposure

accumulation, property is even more favoured than in our
(bullishly toned) November 2009 survey, when a majority of
respondents still expected property prices to continue rising,""
analysts at the bank said in a report.
 Japan's Nikkei share average slipped 0.1 percent, also
surrendering early gains. It has had difficulty rising above
its 25-day moving average, a technical gauge used by domestic
investors.
 Though Alcoa's results beat Wall Street's expectations,
many investors anticipate that earnings forecasts will be
revised downward given expectations for slowing economic
activity in the United States and China.
 The U.S. results season officially started on Monday, with
the focus now on quarterly reports from JPMorgan on Thursday

sentiment is still bearish, and the market is looking for a
catalyst. Corporate earnings could be one,"" said Naoki Koga, a

 SOUTHEAST ASIA BULLS
 Despite the reversal in major Asian bourses, Southeast Asia
remains a bright spot among the region's equity markets.
 Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand were No 2, 3 and 4
in terms of performance so far this year. The benchmark index
for the Philippines was at the highest in 2-½ years, while
Thai stocks were just below a 2-year high hit on Monday.
 A greater reliance on intra-Asian trade and attractive
valuations have been largely behind the outperformance of
Southeast Asia.
 In currency markets, caution was key.
 The euro held steady at $1.2595 with resistance seen
roughly around $1.2690, the trendline from the December high.
 Debt-laden Greece is seeking to raise 1.25 billion euros
through a sale of six-month Treasury bills later in the day.
That could prove to be a litmus test for the single currency in
the short term.
A robust response to a Spanish debt auction earlier this month
saw the euro rally to two-month highs.
 The Australian dollar and Korean won, two of the usual
targets of risk tolerant investors looking for higher returns,
were down on the day and institutional investors maintained a
cautious approach.
 ""The way they are positioned, there is still a feeling that
a a double-dip recession could happen,"" said Jonathan Cavenagh,
a currency strategist at Westpac, Sydney.
 The Australian dollar slid 0.8 percent to US$0.8697 having
stalled in the last three sessions below $0.8800.
 The U.S. dollar was up 0.8 percent to 1212.60 won up 9
percent since May.
 The turnaround in Chinese equity markets also weighed on
commodities, offsetting Alcoa's more bullish outlook for global
aluminium demand.
 U.S. crude oil futures also shed early gains and fell 0.7
percent to $74.39 a barrel, bringing losses to 13 percent since
May.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 13 (Reuters) - The euro consolidated well below
two-month peaks against the dollar on Tuesday as investors
hesitated to go long on the single currency and risk large short
dollar positions during the U.S. earnings season.
 In Asian trade the euro stood at $1.2594, little changed
from late U.S. trade on Monday, with resistance seen around
$1.2721, the trendline from the December high. Near-term support
is seen around $1.2547, the previous session's low.
 Investors were also cautious about the single currency ahead
of Greece's return to capital markets for the first time since
late April.
 The debt-laden country is seeking to raise 1.25 billion euros
($1.57 billion) through a sale of six-month Treasury bills. That
could prove to be a litmus test for the euro in the short term
ahead of the results of the euro zone banks' stress tests next
week, traders said.
 A robust response to a Spanish debt auction earlier this
month saw the euro rally to two-month highs. That coincided with
worries the U.S. was heading towards a double-dip recession,
sending the greenback to its lowest in nearly two-months against
a basket of currencies.
 Those concerns have taken a back seat for now, but traders
said real money investors and margin traders were still being
cautious, given lingering worries about a global slowdown.
 ""The way they are positioned, there is still a feeling that a
a double-dip recession could happen,"" said Jonathan Cavenagh, a
currency strategist at Westpac, Sydney.
 ""I think they could be in for a major surprise if a majority
of U.S. corporate results beat expectations. That should see the
U.S. dollar stage a comeback and hence investors are a bit
cautious about going too short.""
 The dollar index was barely moved at 84.215, having bounced
from the key December 2009 trendline support around 83.80.
 The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 88.70 yen, with decent
resistance seen in the 89-89.15 yen area.
 Dollar offers from Japanese exporters await above 89 yen and
are likely to limit gains in the dollar, traders said.
 The yen struggled for most of the previous session after
Japan's ruling Democratic party suffered a stinging defeat in a
weekend parliamentary election but recouped its losses during
North American trade.
 ""Japan's political uncertainty will likely keep yen assets
under pressure,"" said Tsutomu Soma, senior manager of the foreign
asset department at Okasan Securities.
 ""Yet players cannot figure out whether selling in Japanese
assets, such as shares, would also spark yen selling or
ultimately trigger yen buying on risk aversion.""
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars initially benefited after Alcoa posted a
higher-than-expected profit for the second quarter on Monday.
 But those currencies quickly give back gains as Shanghai
shares fell more than 1 percent, somewhat cooling risk appetite,
a senior trader at a big Japanese bank said.
 Other Dow heavyweights reporting earnings this week include
Intel Corp, JPMorgan Chase and General Electric.
 The Australian currency slipped 0.3 percent to $0.8739 after
rising as high as $0.8780 earlier in the day. Resistance is seen
at the June 21 high of $0.8860 and at $0.8864, a 61.8 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its fall from April's high of $0.9389 to

 * Havana's move sends positive signal to U.S., Europe
 * Economic needs seen tied to prisoners' release
 By Jeff Franks
 HAVANA, July 12 (Reuters) - The Cuban government's
surprising decision to free 52 political prisoners enables
President Raul Castro to reduce political friction both inside
and outside Cuba, and focus on pulling the island out of
financial crisis, Cubans and Cuba experts said.
 They said Castro appeared to be moving to put aside an
issue that has long damaged Cuba's international image, trade
and diplomatic relations to the detriment of its economy.
 ""I think the prisoners are being released for a combination
of reasons, but all related to the need for tourism, trade and
investment to alleviate the economic catastrophe that Cuba is
sliding into,"" Miami-based attorney Timothy Ashby told
Reuters.
 ""The prisoners, especially the hunger strikers, are an
international embarrassment and complicate relations with
trading partners,"" said Ashby, formerly a U.S. Commerce
Department official in charge of trade with Cuba and the
Caribbean.
 The immediate goals, he said, may be to send a positive
signal to the United States and Europe, where key decisions
affecting Cuba could be made in coming months.
 Cuba wants the U.S. Congress to pass a pending bill that
would end a longstanding ban on Americans traveling to the
island -- part of a 48-year-old U.S. trade embargo -- which
could bring a flood of U.S. tourists and much needed revenues
to the cash-strapped island.
 Recent visiting U.S. trade delegations said Cuban officials
had urged them to go back and lobby for the bill's passage.
 Castro has sought improved relations with the European
Union and pushed for the group to amend its common position,
which ties full economic cooperation to the release of
political prisoners and improved human rights.
 His hopes for a change earlier this year, when Spain led
the 27-nation bloc, were dashed by human rights controversies,
but the EU is to revisit the issue in September.
 STRUGGLING CUBAN ECONOMY
 Castro ""surely knows that a substantial prisoner release is
likely to draw a reaction from Washington and Europe, as it
should,"" said Phil Peters, a Cuba expert at the Lexington
Institute think tank in Arlington, Virginia.
 The Cuban leader, who succeeded his older brother Fidel
Castro as president in 2008, has his hands full trying to
modernize Cuba's economy, battered by damaging hurricanes, the
global financial crisis and chronic inefficiencies.
 He has taken small steps toward economic reform and there
have been hints of larger ones to come.
 But since Feb. 23, when imprisoned dissident Orlando Zapata
Tamayo died in a hunger strike seeking better jail conditions,
Cuba has been widely condemned for its human rights record.
 Zapata's death was followed immediately by a long,
life-threatening hunger strike by dissident Guillermo Farinas.
Government-directed harassment of the dissident ""Ladies in
White"" group during March and April marches by the women also
added to the international criticism of Cuban authorities.
 Both Farinas and the Ladies in White were demanding the
release of prisoners included in the 52 to be freed.
 The prisoner release has, for now, quieted foreign critics
and may help Castro focus on economic improvement, said Anya
Landau French, a Cuba expert at the New America Foundation
think tank in Washington.
 ""Why is Raul doing this? It could be because of internal or
external backlash, or to get a distraction off their plate
while they focus on the economy,"" she said.
 REACTION AGAINST STAGNATION
 Farinas ended his hunger strike the day after the releases
were announced. Ladies in White leader Laura Pollan said on
Sunday the group will continue its weekly protest marches until
Cuba frees all of its estimated 167 political prisoners.
 But the group's central issue was the release of the 52,
their sons and husbands arrested in a 2003 crackdown.
 Cuba wants to send the freed prisoners and their families
to Spain, and so far most have accepted the offer. That means
many of the Ladies in White may soon be gone.
 Dissident Miriam Leiva said freeing the prisoners both
""resolves a great injustice"" and reduces an issue ""that has
stood in the way of any type of internal or external opening.""
 ""The Cuban people have a lot of opinions ... and I think
even in the goverment that this society cannot continue to be
stagnant,"" she said.
 Ashby said the release indicated that new blood was
beginning to assert itself in the Cuban leadership.
 It ""signals a broader change in the sense that the younger,
business-oriented generation of Cubans in positions of
government leadership are uncomfortable with archaic repression
and the commercial complications it creates,"" he said.
 But it remained to be seen, experts said, how the United
States will respond to the prisoner release.
 Washington has demanded the freeing of political prisoners
as a condition for improved relations, but may not be in a mood
for major change due to the detention in December of U.S.
contractor Alan Gross in Cuba on suspicion of espionage.
 U.S. officials and his employers have said he was not a spy
but was in Cuba facilitating Internet access to Jewish groups.
 ""I don't know if this (U.S.) administration, timid and not
very active so far regarding Cuba, will respond,"" Peters said.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2010 05:04PM ET</span>",Nations open talks on world arms trade treaty," * Treaty to regulate world's $55 billion arms market
 * Tough talks seen as pact must be by consensus
 By Patrick Worsnip
 UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Reuters) - The world's nations
opened negotiations on Monday on an arms trade treaty meant to
regulate the $55 billion global weapons market and prevent guns
from pouring into conflict zones and fueling wars and
atrocities.
 One person every minute dies as a result of armed violence,
and some 128 armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War in
1989 have led to at least 250,000 deaths each year, according
to the Control Arms Campaign, an international advocacy group.
 After years of debate, the U.N. General Assembly last
October authorized formal talks. Monday marked the start of the
first of three preparatory sessions over the next year, with a
four-week conference planned for 2012 to finalize a treaty.
 Supporters aim is to set common rules for international
arms sales -- from rifles to fighter planes -- to replace a
patchwork of national laws riddled with loopholes that make it
easy to buy weapons for conflicts.
 Key issues in the negotiations will include what criteria
governments will have to fulfill to get a green light for arms
sales and how compliance would be monitored.
 U.N. disarmament chief Sergio Duarte told delegates from
the 192 U.N. member states they could ""help reverse the vicious
cycles of conflict and armed violence, which up until now have
so shattered and destroyed human life and potential.""
 A treaty would seek ""to inject some sense of predictability
into a complex and sensitive issue,"" conference chairman
Roberto Garcia of Argentina said last Friday. That could stop
arms fueling events like the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, where
weapons were sold even after the killing began.
 TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS
 Not all countries are committed to a treaty. Major arms
producers Russia, China, India and Pakistan were among 19
nations that abstained in last year's General Assembly vote,
and one country -- Zimbabwe -- voted against.
 That indicated negotiations would be tough. Diplomats said
a treaty would not be a panacea and rogue governments and
militants would probably keep seeking black market options.
 The United States, which controls two thirds of global arms
sales, agreed to join the treaty drafting process only on
condition that it be run on the basis of consensus --
effectively giving it, and all other countries, a veto.
 The resolution approved by the General Assembly also
included a paragraph diplomats said was essential for the
United States, where the right to private gun ownership is a
sensitive domestic political issue. The paragraph says national
governments will continue to regulate domestic arms sales.
 Nevertheless, President Barack Obama's decision to back the
talks reversed the position of former President George W.
Bush's administration, which had opposed it on the grounds that
national controls were better.
 Advocacy groups urged U.N. member states to push for a
tough treaty that would make it difficult for human rights
violators to get weapons to kill their own people.
 ""By the end of the next two weeks, member states must have
made real progress: and this means delivering a draft text,""
said Anna Macdonald of aid group Oxfam, which wants a treaty.
 British delegate John Duncan described that as
""over-ambitious,"" but said some countries now appeared more
receptive to a treaty than they had last year.
 ""Even the Russians didn't disagree on the need to stop
weapons falling into the hands of criminals and terrorists. The
question is how it's going to be done,"" he told Reuters.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2010 04:40PM ET</span>",CANADA FX DEBT-C$ falls with oil; eyes on Bank of Canada," * C$ ends at 96.39 U.S. cents
 * BoC survey shows business upbeat, wary of global risk
 * Bond prices rise across curve
(Updates to close, adds quote)
 By Jennifer Kwan
 TORONTO, July 12 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar fell on
Monday due in part to soft oil prices, while investors were
slightly cautious about Bank of Canada surveys that showed
upbeat business sentiment but worries about the global
recovery.
 The second-quarter surveys showed businesses were
optimistic in their outlook for sales, investment and hiring,
but their enthusiasm was tempered by fears that global
uncertainties would hurt economic recovery.
 In the business survey, companies reported for the first
time in two years that past sales activity had improved. But
the balance of opinion on future sales -- the difference
between the percentage predicting higher sales minus those
expecting a drop -- fell to 24 percent from 44 percent in the
first quarter. [ID:nN12185840]
 ""The market has been a little cautious in response to the
business outlook survey,"" said Eric Lascelles, chief Canada
macro strategist at TD Securities, referring to the future
sales headline.
 ""The market generally is going to be on pins and needles
leading up to the Bank of Canada next week,"" he added.
 The surveys showed some slowing in the momentum of the
recovery overall, but there were certainly enough positive
aspects, said Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO
Capital Markets.
 ""The main message is that the recovery still seems to be on
solid ground at least in Canada,"" he said.
 The Canadian dollar  finished at C$1.0375 to the
U.S. dollar, or 96.39 U.S. cents, down from Friday's finish at
C$1.0337 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.74 U.S. cents. Monday's drop
followed a gain of 2.8 percent last week.
 The Bank of Canada's business outlook and senior loan
officer surveys are seen as key reports ahead of the July 20
interest rate announcement.
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the Bank of Canada's key policy rate, showed
the market sees an 82 percent chance of a July rate hike.
 [CA/POLL]
 TD's Lascelles said a generally ""risk off"" tone was another
key factor pressuring the Canadian dollar.
 ""It seems to me the motivation is the risk-off trade. The
commodity currencies are suffering a little as various
commodities ease on the day,"" he said.
 U.S. crude oil futures ended lower, snapping a three-day
winning streak. [O/R]
 The currency touched a session low of C$1.0387 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.27 U.S. cents, as North American equity markets
notched a lackluster session following big gains last week.
[.N] [.TO]
 BONDS HIGHER
 Canadian bond prices advanced, reflecting a pause after a
sharp move following stellar domestic jobs data on Friday, said
Kam Bath, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 The economy added a whopping 93,200 jobs in June, easily
outstripping market predictions for a 15,000-job gain and
contradicting other recent data suggesting Canada's galloping
economic recovery was slowing. [ID:nN09261751]
 ""It's just a bit of unwinding from last week's sharp move,""
Bath said.
 ""That strong employment report pretty much bakes in a July
rate hike. Really, no one is looking for anything different
than that.""
 The two-year bond  rose 7 Canadian cents to yield
1.683 percent, while the 10-year bond  climbed 24
Canadian cents to yield 3.202 percent.
 Canadian bonds outperformed their U.S. counterparts across
the curve. The Canadian 2-year bond  was 103 basis
points above its U.S. counterpart, compared with about 108
basis points in the previous session.

on German sovereign debt. That clashed with reports last week
that the tests would exempt German haircuts.
 But it was largely technical factors that held the euro in
check, particularly the currency's failure to rise above a
downtrend line drawn through its December high. The euro was
last trading at $1.2594, down 0.4 percent, and resistance was
seen just above $1.27, around a two-month high touched on
Friday.
 Traders reported Asian demand around the day's lows at
$1.2550 with automatic stop-loss orders lurking just below.
Stronger bids are seen around an approach of $1.25.
""We're still generally in correction mode, but we remain
pretty negative on the euro in the second half of the year,""
said Shaun Osborne, strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.
 ""There's still some upside potential, but after retesting
and failing to break the trendline, we've seen some negative
price action, and I think you'll see the euro settle into a
$1.23-$1.27 range for a while longer.""
 Debt woes in Greece and fears about bank exposure to
troubled euro zone countries in June drove the euro to a
multiyear trough below $1.19 before staging a corrective rally.
The euro is still off 12 percent against the dollar in 2010.
 Details of the stress tests on 91 European banks are due on
July 23 as the European Union seeks to restore confidence in
the sector.
 If the tests are deemed insufficiently severe, markets are
likely to punish the euro and fear the worst about Europe's
banks, Osborne said. ""The tests must be realistic,"" he said.
 Data showed speculative bets against the euro were trimmed
last week, and some analysts say that may leave room for
investors to start rebuilding euro shorts.
 YEN RECOVERS, STERLING WOBBLES
 Against the yen, the dollar was unchanged at 88.59 yen,
having climbed as high as around 89.15 yen after Prime Minister
Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), lost its upper
house majority in an election on Sunday, putting at risk
efforts to deal with the country's debt.
 Tokyo traders said the election outcome initially sparked
unwinding in long yen positions, which rose sharply last week.
 Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.5030 after ratings agency
Standard & Poor's affirmed the UK's ""AAA"" long-term rating but
maintained a negative outlook.
 Markets were looking ahead to second-quarter earnings
results from U.S. firms, with Alcoa Inc. reporting on Monday. A
recent string of weak U.S. economic data has raised speculation
the recovery may be losing momentum, hurting the dollar.
 Those fears also helped the yen recover its post-election
losses, as the currency tends to rise when investors grow
averse to risk and unwind trades financed with borrowed yen.
 But Boris Schlossberg, a director for currency research at
GFT Forex, said that if U.S. company earnings this week suggest
interest rates are likely to rebound off their recent lows, the
dollar will move higher against the yen irrespective of
political uncertainty surrounding Kan and the DPJ.

 * Says debt swap positive step in relations with creditors
 * Says market access dependent on investors' risk aversion
(Adds rise in Argentine bonds, comment from trader)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings raised
Argentina's credit ratings out of default on Monday following
completion of a debt swap last month, but it said the deal
would not be enough to open new financing sources for the
country.
 Fitch assigned to Argentina's foreign-currency bonds a B
rating, or five notches into junk rating, noting that the
country has removed from the market more than 90 percent of the
bonds it defaulted on in 2002.
 ""In Fitch's view, this represents a positive step toward
normalizing relations with creditors,"" the ratings agency said
in a statement. Bit it said the country's financing flexibility
remains restricted.
 ""Access to voluntary debt markets will be dependent on
investors' risk perception and the development of legal
challenges by holdout bondholders,"" Fitch said.
 Argentina last month managed to obtain about 70 percent of
investor acceptance for an $18.3 billion swap of defaulted debt
with the reopening of its 2005 debt restructuring.
 But about $6 billion of defaulted bonds are still owned by
""holdout"" creditors who rejected the swap. Their lawsuits have
blocked international bond sales by the government, which needs
financing to keep state spending high ahead of a presidential
election in October 2011.
 The Argentine government had wanted to issue $1 billion in
a new 2017 Global bond in tandem with its debt swap, but
volatile market conditions tied to Europe's debt crisis forced
officials to shelve the plan.
 Fitch said Argentina's financing needs ""appear manageable""
during the next two years thanks to continued intra-public
sector borrowing, significant holdings of government debt by
public sector entities and the country's ability to tap central
bank reserves.
 However, the agency said Argentina's ratings remain
constrained by a volatile macroeconomic performance, a weak
policy framework and still-high government debt ratios relative
to other B-rated countries.
 Argentine bonds traded locally over-the-counter gained
momentum on Monday after Fitch's announcement, trading 1.6
percent higher on average in late afternoon trade.
 ""The ratings upgrade is a logical step after the debt
swap,"" said Francisco Marra, a trader at Bull Market Brokers in
Buenos Aires. ""This is just the beginning in terms of the
country integrating global markets.""

415,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2010 03:04PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Signs euro zone crisis may have turned corner," By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, July 12 (Reuters) - It's too early to call the end of
the euro zone crisis, but signs are growing that Europe may have
turned a corner in its struggle to restore financial stability.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde, mangling a
treasured Winston Churchill quotation, said last week: ""We are
in the middle of the beginning of the end.""
 More prudently, we may be seeing ""the end of the beginning"".
 The evidence comes partly from financial markets, which are
calmer, partly from the real economy, which is perkier, and
partly from policy, which is responding at last to at least some
investor concerns.
 There are still plenty of risks -- lack of faith in planned
stress tests of European banks; low or no economic growth; more
credit rating agency downgrades of sovereign debt; an eventual
Greek default or debt restructuring; weaknesses in euro zone
governance; and political resistance to painful reforms.
 But on balance, things are starting to look up.
 ""The figures we have are not confirming this pessimism,""
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said last
week, dismissing analyst predictions of stagnation or even an
austerity-induced double-dip recession in the euro zone.
 Let's try to define what would constitute a turning point.
 The pivotal moment in the global financial crisis of
2007-2009 came when the U.S. authorities conducted stress tests
of banks' resilience to further shocks and recapitalised some.
 Success was not instant. There were early suspicions that
the tests were not tough enough, or had been rigged in cahoots
with bankers to fit the amount of capital available.
 But the tests ultimately satisfied investors that U.S. banks
were safe and that the government would not let another major
financial institution collapse as it did with Lehman Brothers.
 Europe is not quite there yet. But EU regulators have now
agreed to conduct individual stress tests on 91 major banks
representing 65 percent of the region's balance sheet against an
agreed set of criteria, including some sovereign risk, and to
publish the results on July 23.
 Critics have been quick to scorn what is known of the
criteria, which insiders say were a hard-fought compromise
between regulators who wanted multiple risk scenarios, including
a bigger sovereign default, and those who wanted no sovereign
risk at all.
 Unlike the longer-running U.S. choreography, the Europeans
may not have time to arrange the recapitalisation of any banks
found vulnerable before the results are published.
 But there is a strong political commitment of governments to
do so where necessary, possibly drawing on a newly established
euro zone financial backstop, created in May originally to lend
to states shut out of credit markets.
 The existence of a 440 billion euro ($558 billion) European
Financial Stability Facility guaranteed by euro zone states
should reassure investors that any exposed banks won't be left
twisting in the wind, even though it would require a unanimous
political decision to use it.
 So let's examine the case for a turning point.
 The euro has recovered from lows around $1.19 to touch
two-month highs above $1.27 on Friday, partly due to
disappointing U.S. economic data. Spain and Portugal have been
able to sell their debt at auctions, albeit paying higher risk
premiums.
 The ECB withdrew 199 billion euros in crisis liquidity from
the market smoothly at the end of June, and the central bank's
emergency purchases of euro zone government bonds have steadily
declined. Trichet felt confident enough to highlight that
tapering-off last week.
 European stock markets have begun to rebound, led by bank
shares, on growing expectations that the stress tests will not
uncover new horrors.
 Governments across Europe are introducing austerity measures
to bring down public deficits, and structural reforms designed
to address longer-term problems of ageing populations, rigid
labour markets and soaring health costs.
 Greece, under the whip of an EU/IMF bailout programme, is
pushing through unpopular reforms cutting pensions, raising the
retirement age and reducing layoff payments and notice.
 France is raising its retirement age and the contribution
years needed for a full pension. Spain is easing hiring and
firing laws to try to bring down 20 percent unemployment.
 This will not be smooth or easy, given resistance from
labour and interest groups, but the political climate is more
permissive for such reforms than at any time in a generation.
 At the EU policy level, the Greek bailout and the EFSF are
on track and the stress tests are under way.
 Governments are broadly agreed on strengthening enforcement
of the bloc's battered budget discipline rules. The EFSF,
created as a temporary expedient for three years, may be
extended and morph into a permanent crisis resolution mechanism.
 Longer-term worries, particularly about Greece's ability to
pay its debts on time and in full, may continue to dog the euro
zone, as well as pessimism about the economic growth prospects
of ageing and inflexible west European societies.
 Protests against austerity and a shrinking welfare state may
grow. Governments may fall over unpopular reforms.
 But for now, it looks as if the worst of the euro zone
crisis may just be over.

 * EFSF will not issue bonds without aid request-CEO
 * EU to focus more on debt, broaden sanctions for offenders
(Adds news conference after Eurogroup meeting)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro zone's emergency loan
facility should be operational this month, finance ministers
said on Monday, expressing hope Slovakia would cease to block
the activation of the 440 billion euro ($554 billion) fund.
 The special-purpose vehicle, called the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), is being set up to provide temporary
financing to euro zone countries in trouble and its triggering
needs the signatures of all 16 countries in the currency area.
 Slovakia has refused to sign the EFSF's framework agreement
because parties that won elections there in June have been
opposed to the mechanism, blocking the process.
 At their monthly meeting, called the Eurogroup, euro zone
finance ministers called on Bratislava to honour its
commitments.
 ""We made clear in today's discussions that our expectation
was that the Slovak government will sign the framework agreement
(on the EFSF) and take on board all the commitments made by the
previous Slovak government,"" Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude
Juncker told a news conference after the meeting.
 Juncker, who will meet Slovak Prime Minister Iveta Radicova
on Tuesday, had said earlier: ""I do think that Slovakia will
sign up before mid-July. The instrument (EFSF) will be available
without any doubt before the end of the month."" 
 Radicova said after meeting EU President Herman Van Rompuy
that Slovakia's parliament and cabinet had to be consulted
before the country could sign off on the EFSF. The Slovak
cabinet would discuss the issue on Wednesday, she said.
 Pressure on Slovakia to unblock the EFSF is mounting because
the fund is a crucial part, together with stress tests of EU
banks, of Europe's efforts to restore confidence in financial
markets after the Greek debt crisis.
 Of the 16 euro zone members, 15 have signed the EFSF
framework pact and 13 are shareholders of the Luxembourg-based
SPV. The missing three -- Italy, Belgium and Slovakia -- will be
shareholders once they complete national procedures.
 The EFSF's chief executive, Klaus Regling, reported the
state of preparations for activation of the special-purpose
vehicle to euro zone finance ministers on Monday.
 ""We are almost fully operational if there is a need,"" he
told the news conference. 
 Asked whether the EFSF, to establish itself on the markets,
could issue a small amount of bonds without any request for
financing from a euro zone country, Regling said:
 ""From a purely financial market perspective it might help to
do that, on the other hand it is the political will of euro area
ministers not to do it before we get a request for financing.""
 Without a request for financial help, the EFSF would have a
problem over what to do with the cash it raised.
 ""That is not a situation we want to be in,"" he said.
 
 STRESS TESTS
 While the EFSF seems unlikely to be required to bail out a
euro zone government anytime soon, it could come in handy to
recapitalise some of Europe's banks after the results of stress
tests on lenders are released on July 23. 
 EU finance ministers join euro zone colleagues on Tuesday
and will discuss what information to release from the stress
tests of 91 EU banks, or 65 percent of its banking sector.
 They will discuss what back-stop mechanisms they can use to
recapitalise banks if necessary, as not all countries have, like
Spain, dedicated funds for that purpose.
 ""The overall banking sector is resilient but at the same
time when we publish the results of the stress tests we will
have to prepare for pockets of vulnerability and it is essential
national backstops will be in place,"" European Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
 He said vulnerable banks should first try to recapitalise
themselves by tapping private investors and public money should
be used only as a last resort. If governments exhaust their
funds, they can turn to the EFSF -- once it is operational.
 If it is not, EU countries would still be able to tap a 60
billion euro EU loan facility that is guaranteed by the EU
budget, which, unlike the EFSF, is already fully operational.
 The euro fell against the dollar on Monday on concerns about
the results of the stress tests.
 Some in the market said the euro had been knocked by a
German magazine report that the tests would include a haircut on
German sovereign debt under certain conditions, countering
reports last week that the tests would exempt German haircuts.
 Analysts said the efficacy of the tests would depend on how
much detail they included, and the possibility the results may
be thin on in-depth information was weighing on the euro.
 ""First it is said they (the stress tests) are much too
strict, that this is killing the banks. The next day it is said
they are too weak and have no effect. The truth is mostly in the
middle,"" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said.
 ""I think the decision to extend the stress-test scenarios
and to publish the results ... is an important step to end
insecurity on the markets about the situation of the banks in
Europe. That is the objective of the exercise. I hope we achieve
that,"" he said before the euro zone ministers' meeting.
 To boost market confidence further in EU fiscal policies,
the bloc's finance ministers agreed on Monday to start
monitoring each others' budget plans from 2011, focus more on
reducing debt and broaden sanctions for EU budget rule-breakers.
 In a statement after a meeting of the ministers, EU
President Herman Van Rompuy, who chaired the talks, said the
group also agreed to monitor competitiveness in the bloc through
a scoreboard of indicators.
 Should the indicators fall below certain levels, the
ministers would issue policy recommendations under a new
procedure for excessive imbalances.
 Ministers will meet for a special session on Sept. 7 to
discuss a permanent crisis resolution mechanism.

 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro retreated on Monday

 * S&P says challenging spending cuts yet to be achieved
 * Sterling falls vs dollar
 
 (Adds Treasury, analyst reaction)
 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Britain is still in
danger of losing its triple-A rating despite the ambitious
fiscal tightening announced by the country's new coalition
government last month, Standard & Poor's said on Monday.
 The verdict is a blow to finance minister George Osborne who
has staked his reputation on tackling Britain's record budget
deficit -- running at 11 percent of GDP -- and keeping its
top-notch credit rating.
 ""Given the government's stated determination to protect the
UK's AAA credit rating, it is likely to be more than a little
disappointed by Standard & Poor's move today,"" said Howard
Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
 The Treasury responded to the news, saying Osborne was aware
there was more work to do. ""The Chancellor is very clear the job
is not done,"" a spokesman said. ""The next step will be to set
out individual departmental spending totals in the Spending
Review on 20 October.""
 S&P said it was keeping a negative outlook on Britain's
triple-A credit rating since challenging spending cuts had yet
to be made and the economy may not grow as fast as the
government had factored in.
 ""Standard & Poor's medium-term economic forecasts for the UK
are less optimistic than the assumptions underlying the budget,""
the credit rating agency said in a statement. 
 ""We therefore believe there is still a material risk that
the UK's net general government debt burden may approach a level
incompatible with the 'AAA' rating.""
 The pound fell after the announcement, which disappointed
some investors who had hoped Osborne's austerity budget had done
enough to persuade the ratings agency to give Britain the
all-clear. Sterling fell to $1.5017 in the minutes after the S&P
announcement, from $1.5068 just before. It was trading at
$1.5024 by 1639 GMT.
 Britain's coalition government unveiled a package of
spending cuts and tax rises in an emergency budget on June 22
designed to cut a record budget deficit to almost nothing in
five years.
 S&P cut the outlook on Britain's 'AAA' rating to negative in
May 2009, a move that typically carries a one in three chance of
a downgrade. Its stance contrasts with more favourable views
from Moody's and Fitch, both of which have affirmed a stable
outlook on Britain's triple-A rating in recent weeks.
 Britain's government is hoping that around three quarters of
the fiscal squeeze will be borne by spending cuts, rather than
tax increases, and will give more details on where the axe will
fall in a spending review in October.
 ""We will continue to review the rating in light of further
information over the coming months about the extent of the
expenditure-led fiscal consolidation,"" S&P said.
 The ratings agency said the fiscal challenge facing
Britain's government was a ""formidable"" one.
 It said its growth assumptions were lower than those of
Britain's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility
(OBR), because it reckoned private sector deleveraging will hit
demand harder.
 ""We estimate domestic credit in the UK to be just over 200
percent of GDP in 2010, compared with a median of below 150
percent of GDP for 'AAA' rated sovereigns,"" S&P said. ""So, while
we agree with the OBR that a rebalancing of the economy will
occur over the next five years with net exports contributing
positively to growth, we think the process will likely proceed
more slowly.""

 * Stocks zig-zag ahead of earnings season start
 * Copper falls on China's drop in demand
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday, as investors grew cautious on the health of European
banks ahead of results of stress tests on the sector, while
stocks struggled for direction ahead of the onset of the U.S.
corporate earnings season.
 The second-quarter earnings season was looming large for
investors who are seeking a clearer picture of the economy's
prospects, as a fading recovery, persistently high unemployment
in the United States, Europe's debt troubles and commercial
real estate losses have kept concerns of a double-dip recession
alive.
 Markets were also jittery about Europe's fiscal issues and
the health of its financial sector ahead of the stress tests on
the continent's banks -- including many regional banks where
markets suspect most of the sore spots lie -- as it seeks to
restore confidence in the sector.
 China's release of data showwing a drop in demand for
copper for a third straight month drove down the price of
copper more than 2 percent and weighed on the price of mining
shares on both sides of the Atlantic. China is the world's top
metals consumer, and the drop in demand cast a shadow on the
demand outlook.
 The euro fell against the dollar, pulling back from a
two-month high, with investors betting recent gains were too
far, too fast, while oil prices fell more than 1 percent as the
dollar strengthened and ahead of corporate earnings results.
 ""Earnings season is a risk. The weaker euro will help
internationally-exposed European companies, but not U.S.
companies like Caterpillar ,"" said Heino Ruland,
strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt. ""So we could see a
divergence.""
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> edged up 4.31
points, or 0.04 percent, at 10,202.34. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> eased 0.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to
1,076.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was off 0.97
points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,195.48.
 The earnings season will kick off with Alcoa  after
the market close on Monday, and results from Intel , JP
Morgan , Google , Bank of America , GE
 and Citi  will follow later in the week.
 Thomson Reuters data shows earnings of S&P 500 firms are
expected to grow 27 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months, after expanding at a rate of 58.3
percent in the January-March period.
 So far, with 26 of 500 firms already reported, 69 percent
of earnings came in above expectations.
 The S&P Materials index <.GSPM> slid 1.1 percent after the
Chinese on falling copper demand, sending Freeport McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc  down 4.3 percent to $63.12.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> eased 0.18
percent.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> eked out a
gain, rising 0.3 percent for a fifth straight day of gains.
Shares of BP  surged 9.4 percent to their highest close
in a month, boosted by reports of asset disposals to help pay
for the oil major's Gulf of Mexico spill and hopes for a new
system to capture almost all the spewing oil.
 EURO, COPPER FALL
 The euro fell 0.52 percent to $1.2568 , pulling away
from last week's two-month high as concerns about the
effectiveness of stress tests on European banks prompted
investors to trim long positions in the single currency.
 The stress tests are being performed on 91 European banks,
with results due on July 23, a major step as the European Union
seeks to restore confidence in the sector. [ID:nLDE66B06L]
 ""In the near term, the euro could suffer from any
disappointment triggered by the stress tests,"" said Gareth
Berry, a currency strategist at UBS AG.
 China's trade surplus in June jumped on surprising strength
in exports, but copper imports fell by 17.3 percent to 328,231
tonnes. Copper  was traded at $6,641.75 a tonne from
$6,769 on Friday when it hit a near two-week high of $6,775.
 Beijing is scheduled to release a slew of economic data for
June later this week, including economic growth, inflation and
industrial output, expected to shed light on the health of the
world's third-largest economy.
 U.S. Treasuries were little changed ahead of the first of
this week's $69 billion worth of bond auctions. The Treasury
will auction $35 billion of three-year notes at 1 p.m. (1700
GMT), the first of three sales which also include 10-year notes
and 30-year bonds.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
10/32, with the yield at 3.0211 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was unchanged with the yield at 0.633
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up
17/32, with the yield at 4.0101 percent.
 Analysts also are keeping a close watch on the auctions as
the bond market remains relatively expensive after a
three-month rally that has pulled benchmark yields below 3.0
percent from more than 4.0 percent at the start of April.
 U.S. crude oil  fell 1.42 percent to $75 a barrel

with Germany, France, Italy, the EU in general, and with the
United States,"" Medvedev said in a speech to Russian
ambassadors. 
 ""The foreign policy of our country... pursues one sole aim:
to promote the growth of our citizens' prosperity in every way
possible,"" he said.
 Since replacing Vladimir Putin as president in 2008,
Medvedev has toned down Cold War-style attacks on the West which
were the hallmark of Putin's presidency.
 Medvedev's key foreign policy success has been to improve
relations with the United States as part of President Barack
Obama effort to ""reset"" ties which fell to a post-Cold War low
during Russia's 2008 war with U.S. ally Georgia.
 The Kremlin chief mixed his call for an alliance with a
warning that Iran was moving closer to getting nuclear weapons,
the Kremlin's first such outright warning that the Islamic
Republic may be seeking to build an atomic bomb.[ID:nLDE66B165]
 ""Iran is moving closer to possessing the potential which in
principle could be used for the creation of nuclear weapons,""
Medvedev said in a speech at the Foreign Ministry.
 Iran denies it is trying to make nuclear weapons and says it
has a right to nuclear power.

 ALLIANCES FOR INVESTMENT
 Medvedev is trying to re-brand Russia after the crisis
revealed the weakness of an economic model based on exports of
natural resources and high corporate borrowing abroad, diplomats
said.
 His plan, Russian officials say, is to attract at least some
of the trillions of dollars in investment that Moscow says it
needs for upgrading infrastructure ranging from roads and
pipelines to oil fields and hospitals.
 Foreign investment remains comparatively small at $265.8
billion since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and
investors complain of rampant corruption, poor property rights,
crooked judges and stifling red tape.
 ""We believe in the triumph of law and that we can stamp out
corruption... for the success of modernisation,"" Medvedev said.
 Investors said a genuine change in policy could clean up
Russia's image as a speculative boom-bust economy where the
giant potential rewards of putting money into Russia are checked
by an array of risks including the expropriation of property.
 But critics say Medvedev remains the junior partner to
Putin, who is prime minister and leader of the biggest political
party in a system which is unwilling to change.
 ""The Russian establishment sees no systemic change as a key
precondition of the country's modernisation,"" said Fyodor
Lukyanov, editor of the journal ""Russia in Global Affairs"".
 ""This is mutually beneficial cooperation based on borrowing
some projects from the West which look interesting to Russia and
doing them with the support of the EU and the U.S., and this can
be done without any significant change in foreign policy.""

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - World stocks eased on
Monday while the euro fell broadly as investors grew cautious
ahead of a slew of key U.S. corporate earnings and details of
tests on European banks' financial health.
 While second-quarter earnings are expected to come in
strong, investors remained concerned about Europe's fiscal
issues and the health of its financial sector ahead of the
""stress tests"" on the continent's banks.
 U.S. investors are focused on Alcoa Inc's  results
released after the market closes, marking the unofficial start
of earnings season.
 While Alcoa, the first Dow component to report earnings, is
expected to swing to a profit in its second quarter, analysts
have been cutting their estimates for the firm due to falling
aluminum prices.
 ""The focus is on Alcoa and earnings, and there's a little
bit of anxiety, especially since we're coming off such a strong
week,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at Avalon
Partners in New York.
 ""The European tests and prospects for financial regulation

 Thomson Reuters data shows earnings of S&P 500 firms are
expected to grow 27 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months, after expanding at a rate of 58.3
percent in the January-March period.
 So far, with 26 of 500 firms already reported, 69 percent
of earnings came in above expectations.
 EURO STUMBLES
 The euro fell 0.41 percent to $1.2582 , pulling away
from last week's two-month high as concerns about the
effectiveness of stress tests on European banks prompted
investors to trim long positions in the single currency.
 The stress tests are being performed on 91 European banks
with results due on July 23, a major step as the European Union
seeks to restore confidence in the sector. [ID:nLDE66B06L]
 ""In the near term, the euro could suffer from any

 U.S. Treasuries were little changed ahead of the first of
this week's $69 billion worth of bond auctions. The Treasury
will auction $35 billion of three-year notes at 1 p.m. (1700
GMT), the first of three sales which also include 10-year notes
and 30-year bonds.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
3/32, with the yield at 3.0465 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was unchanged, with the yield at 0.634
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up
8/32, with the yield at 4.020 percent.
 Analysts also are keeping a close watch on the auctions as
the bond market remains relatively expensive after a
three-month rally that has pulled benchmark yields below 3.0
percent from more than 4.0 percent at the start of April.

 * Slovak finance minister says will decide soon
 * Slovakia blocking activation of 440 billion euro fund
 
 By Jan Strupczewski and Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro zone's emergency loan
facility should be operational this month, finance ministers
said on Monday, expressing hope Slovakia would cease to block
the activation of the 440 billion euro ($554 billion) fund.
 The special-purpose vehicle, called the European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF), is being set up to provide temporary
financing to euro zone countries in trouble but its activation
needs the signatures of all 16 countries in the currency area.
 Slovakia has refused to sign the EFSF's framework agreement
because parties that won elections there in June have been
opposed to the mechanism, blocking the whole process.
 But officials voiced confidence that after monthly talks
among finance ministers from the 16-country euro zone and the
wider, 27-country European Union in Brussels on Monday and
Tuesday, the Slovaks would subscribe to the EFSF.
 ""I do think that Slovakia will sign up before mid-July. The
instrument (EFSF) will be available without any doubt before the
end of the month,"" the chairman of euro zone finance ministers,
Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters before the meeting.
 Slovak Finance Minister Ivan Miklos kept his options open.
 ""I am not here for the signing, I am here for discussing and
negotiating. But we will decide soon,"" he said.
 Pressure on Slovakia to unblock the EFSF is mounting because
the fund is a crucial part, together with stress tests of EU
banks, of Europe's efforts to restore confidence in financial
markets after the Greek debt crisis.
 ""I am very optimistic that the new Slovak finance minister
recognises the seriousness of the situation and a signature will
be given in the next hours or days,"" Austrian Finance Minister
Josef Proell said.
 ""And then the vehicle will be fully operational,"" he said.
 
 STRESS TESTS
 While the EFSF seems unlikely to be required to bail out a
euro zone government anytime soon, it could come in handy to
recapitalise some of Europe's banks after the results of stress
tests on lenders are released on July 23. 
 EU finance ministers join their euro zone colleagues on
Tuesday and will discuss what information to release from the
stress tests of 91 EU banks, or 65 percent of its banking
sector.
 They will discuss what back-stop mechanisms they can use to
recapitalise banks in case the results show it is necessary, as
not all countries have, like Spain, dedicated funds for that
purpose.
 If banks are unable to raise the capital from the markets,
national governments are supposed to provide the money and if
they exhaust their funds, they can turn to the EFSF -- provided
it is operational.
 If it is not, EU countries would still be able to tap a 60
billion euro EU loan facility that is guaranteed by the EU
budget, which, unlike the EFSF, is already fully operational.
 The euro fell against the dollar on Monday, pulling back
from a two-month high as concerns about the results of the
stress tests on European banks prompted investors to trim long
positions in the single currency.
 Some in the market said the euro had been knocked by a
German magazine report that the tests would include a haircut on
German sovereign debt under certain conditions, countering
reports last week that the tests would exempt German haircuts.
 Analysts said the efficacy of the tests would depend on how
much detail they included, and the possibility the results may
be thin on in-depth information was weighing on the euro.
 ""First it is said they (the stress tests) are much too
strict, that this is killing the banks. The next day it is said
they are too weak and have no effect. The truth is mostly in the
middle,"" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said.
""I think the decision to extend the stress-test scenarios and
to publish the results ... is an important step to end
insecurity on the markets about the situation of the banks in
Europe. That is the objective of the exercise. I hope we achieve
that,"" he said before the euro zone ministers' meeting.

 (Adds details, background)
 ATHENS, July 12 (Reuters) - Greece almost halved its central
government budget deficit in the first six months of the year as
drastic spending cuts outweighed weaker than expected tax
revenues, the finance ministry said on Monday.
 The deficit, which does not include spending by local
government and social security organisations, stood at 9.65
billion euros ($12.16 billion) from 17.9 billion euros in the
same period in 2009, the ministry said in a statement.
 ""(The deficit) shrank 46 percent compared with an annual
target of 39.5 percent,"" the statement said.
 Greece managed to cut spending by 12.8 percent, beating an
annual target for a 5.5 percent cut. Public investment was
slashed by 40 percent to 3.7 billion euros.
 By contrast, net budget revenues fell short of an annual
13.7 percent increase target, rising by just 7.2 percent.
 The figures refer to the central government deficit, not the
general government shortfall measured under euro zone rules, and
therefore do not offer a complete picture.
 The general government deficit includes hefty spending areas
such as welfare and pension payments. Greece has pledged to
slash the general government deficit to 8.1 percent of GDP from
13.6l percent last year as part of a 110 billion euro bailout
from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2010 10:40AM ET</span>",RPT-ANALYSIS-Signs euro zone crisis may have turned corner," By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, July 12 (Reuters) - It's too early to call the end of
the euro zone crisis, but signs are growing that Europe may have
turned a corner in its struggle to restore financial stability.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde, mangling a
treasured Winston Churchill quotation, said last week: ""We are
in the middle of the beginning of the end.""
 More prudently, we may be seeing ""the end of the beginning"".
 The evidence comes partly from financial markets, which are
calmer, partly from the real economy, which is perkier, and
partly from policy, which is responding at last to at least some
investor concerns.
 There are still plenty of risks -- lack of faith in planned
stress tests of European banks; low or no economic growth; more
credit rating agency downgrades of sovereign debt; an eventual
Greek default or debt restructuring; weaknesses in euro zone
governance; and political resistance to painful reforms.
 But on balance, things are starting to look up.
 ""The figures we have are not confirming this pessimism,""
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said last
week, dismissing analyst predictions of stagnation or even an
austerity-induced double-dip recession in the euro zone.
 Let's try to define what would constitute a turning point.
 The pivotal moment in the global financial crisis of
2007-2009 came when the U.S. authorities conducted stress tests
of banks' resilience to further shocks and recapitalised some.
 Success was not instant. There were early suspicions that
the tests were not tough enough, or had been rigged in cahoots
with bankers to fit the amount of capital available.
 But the tests ultimately satisfied investors that U.S. banks
were safe and that the government would not let another major
financial institution collapse as it did with Lehman Brothers.
 Europe is not quite there yet. But EU regulators have now
agreed to conduct individual stress tests on 91 major banks
representing 65 percent of the region's balance sheet against an
agreed set of criteria, including some sovereign risk, and to
publish the results on July 23.
 Critics have been quick to scorn what is known of the
criteria, which insiders say were a hard-fought compromise
between regulators who wanted multiple risk scenarios, including
a bigger sovereign default, and those who wanted no sovereign
risk at all.
 Unlike the longer-running U.S. choreography, the Europeans
may not have time to arrange the recapitalisation of any banks
found vulnerable before the results are published.
 But there is a strong political commitment of governments to
do so where necessary, possibly drawing on a newly established
euro zone financial backstop, created in May originally to lend
to states shut out of credit markets.
 The existence of a 440 billion euro ($558 billion) European
Financial Stability Facility guaranteed by euro zone states
should reassure investors that any exposed banks won't be left
twisting in the wind, even though it would require a unanimous
political decision to use it.
 So let's examine the case for a turning point.
 The euro has recovered from lows around $1.19 to touch
two-month highs above $1.27 on Friday, partly due to
disappointing U.S. economic data. Spain and Portugal have been
able to sell their debt at auctions, albeit paying higher risk
premiums.
 The ECB withdrew 199 billion euros in crisis liquidity from
the market smoothly at the end of June, and the central bank's
emergency purchases of euro zone government bonds have steadily
declined. Trichet felt confident enough to highlight that
tapering-off last week.
 European stock markets have begun to rebound, led by bank
shares, on growing expectations that the stress tests will not
uncover new horrors.
 Governments across Europe are introducing austerity measures
to bring down public deficits, and structural reforms designed
to address longer-term problems of ageing populations, rigid
labour markets and soaring health costs.
 Greece, under the whip of an EU/IMF bailout programme, is
pushing through unpopular reforms cutting pensions, raising the
retirement age and reducing layoff payments and notice.
 France is raising its retirement age and the contribution
years needed for a full pension. Spain is easing hiring and
firing laws to try to bring down 20 percent unemployment.
 This will not be smooth or easy, given resistance from
labour and interest groups, but the political climate is more
permissive for such reforms than at any time in a generation.
 At the EU policy level, the Greek bailout and the EFSF are
on track and the stress tests are under way.
 Governments are broadly agreed on strengthening enforcement
of the bloc's battered budget discipline rules. The EFSF,
created as a temporary expedient for three years, may be
extended and morph into a permanent crisis resolution mechanism.
 Longer-term worries, particularly about Greece's ability to
pay its debts on time and in full, may continue to dog the euro
zone, as well as pessimism about the economic growth prospects
of ageing and inflexible west European societies.
 Protests against austerity and a shrinking welfare state may
grow. Governments may fall over unpopular reforms.
 But for now, it looks as if the worst of the euro zone
crisis may just be over.

 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Monday, pulling back from a two-month high as
concerns about the results of stress tests on European banks
prompted investors to trim long positions in the single
currency.
 The yen pared losses against the dollar following Japanese
election results showing political uncertainty ahead.
 Markets were looking ahead to second-quarter earnings
results from U.S. firms, with Alcoa Inc reporting on Monday. A
weak run of economic data has raised speculation the economic
recovery may be losing momentum and has stung the dollar.
 Still, many investors expect a solid earnings season.
 Also ahead are more details of stress tests on 91 European
banks -- the results of which are due on July 23 -- as the
European Union seeks to restore confidence in the sector.
 ""In the near term, the euro could suffer from any
disappointment triggered by the stress tests,"" said Gareth
Berry, a currency strategist at UBS AG.
 The latest figures on IMM speculative positions showed a
sharp decrease in bets against the euro, consistent with its
recent rally. But some analysts say the current level of bets
may open the door for investors to start once again rebuilding
euro short positions.
 ""With euro shorts now cut so sharply, the scope for clients
to enter new short positions has increased substantially,
leaving the euro especially vulnerable to a possible shift in
sentiment,"" said Berry.
 In morning trading in New York, the euro had fallen 0.5
percent on the day to $1.2573, easing from $1.2723 hit on
Friday. Traders reported Asian demand around the day's lows at
$1.2550 with stops lurking below, ahead of stronger bids placed
on the approach to $1.2500.
 Some in the market said the euro had been knocked by a
weekend German magazine report that the stress tests would
include loan markdowns on German sovereign debt under certain
conditions, countering reports last week that the tests would
exempt German haircuts.
 The single currency was also under selling pressure after
its failure late last week to rise above a downtrend line drawn
through the euro's high hit in December and an April peak, and
resistance was seen just above $1.2700.
 The dollar index, which tracks its performance versus a
basket of other currencies, rose 0.4 percent, recovering from a
slide to 83.622 on Friday, its weakest since May 10.
 Brad Bechtel, a managing director at Faros Trading LLC,
said investors should keep an eye on the 85.00 level in the
dollar index. ""This needs to hold for the recent dollar bears
to maintain their momentum,"" he said.
 JAPAN ELECTIONS
 The dollar was back to flat at 88.57 yen, having climbed as
high as around 89.15 yen.
 The yen initially suffered after Japan's ruling coalition,
led by Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan,
lost its upper house majority in an election on Sunday, putting
at risk efforts to deal with the country's debt.
 Tokyo traders said the election outcome triggered unwinding
in long yen positions, which rose significantly last week.
 ""It is difficult to prognosticate if the latest political
developments in Japan will have long term consequences on
dollar/yen,"" said Boris Schlossberg, a director for currency
research at GFT Forex. ""The pair tends to trade on interest
rate differentials.""
 Schlossberg added that if U.S. company earnings this week
support the view interest rates are likely to rebound off their
recent lows, dollar/yen should in turn move higher irrespective
of the political uncertainty surrounding Kan and the DPJ. 
 U.S. earnings, in addition to data on inflation, retail

 * Default laws need improvement to deal with foreign banks
 * Rouble's outlook is fine, attracts risk-lovers
 
 By Andrey Ostroukh
 MOSCOW, July 12 (Reuters) - Russia needs better bankruptcy
laws and a more convertible rouble if it wants to further
develop the foreign exchange market and attract international
players, the local head of a major industry organisation said.
 Developed from scratch after the fall of the Soviet Union,
the Russian forex market has become a steady operating system
with several hundred banks in less than 20 years.
 However, to open the door for international deals and trade,
Russia needs to adopt global experience and standards,
particularly in transactions settlement, the head of Russia's
division of major FX industry association ACI, Sergei Romanchuk,
told Reuters in an interview.
 ""A system of real-time payments is the obligatory element to
make the currency freely convertible"", he said.
 ""If it happens, international settlements will become safer
and more standardised which may increase the investment appeal
of Russia from a convenience of transactions point of view"".
 Russia's gross settlement system is still in its infancy and
is so far mainly used between Russia's MICEX exchange and the
central bank, while most commercial players rely on bilateral
agreements -- making the system clunky and increasing risk.
 The central bank is on the case, and plans to implement a
real-time settlement system -- similar to the CLS bank clearing
used in many developed markets -- to every bank by the year-end.
 Another constraining factor is inadequate banking law
lacking appropriate and clear directions in cases of bankruptcy,
defaults, and close-out netting. Close-out netting is a
liquidation procedure permitting one party to claim compensation
from another at market value or at the value equal to the loss
suffered by the non-defaulting party. 
 Russian banks use a local equivalent of the global standards
of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)
master agreement, launched one year ago. 
 But few foreign banks are ready to do netting with Russian
players as the absence of an international settlement mechanism
threatens the non-residents' ability to defend its rights in
Russian courts in case one of the parties defaults.
 ""Every year we hope that the close-out netting law will be
passed and every year it is delayed. The majority of foreign
banks consider cross-cancellation of debts with Russian banks as
risky as they may eventually appear helpless in Russia's
courts,"" Romanchuk said. ""This hinders Russian banks' prospects
in international business.""
 The law on close-out netting was passed by the Duma lower
house of parliament at its first reading one year ago and the
government says it is still under revision.
 Delays are partly attributed to staff changes in the market
watchdog and to the recent global crisis, which shifted the
Duma's focus towards helping the economy out of recession.
 Such changes and legislation are essential if Moscow is to
achieve the status of a major global financial centre by 2020 --
a key ambition of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.
 
 ROUBLE AND ROBOTS
 Romanchuk, who also works as the chief dealer in Russia's
Metallinvestbank, believes that the rouble looks strong in the
medium term due to strong surpluses.
 The still relatively undeveloped derivatives market and the
corresponding legislation makes hedging operations in Russia
more expensive and less effective. But many foreign banks take
risks and unhedged forex positions in Russia as they provide
more profit, Romanchuk said.
 Alongside derivatives, another growth field in Russia's
forex market is algorithmic trading. ""The Russian forex market
is in the beginning of the road to algorithmic trading and it is
likely to continue,"" Romanchuk said.
 While algorithmic trade is widely used on Russian stock and
derivative markets, in forex it accounts for only around 15
percent of transactions in the most liquid dollar/rouble section
on the MICEX exchange with a daily turnover of around $3-4
billion.

 Investors were also waiting for more details on stress tests
on 91 European banks -- the results of which are due later in
the month -- as the European Union seeks to restore confidence
in the sector.
 Analysts said that despite the euro's rally this month, its
failure to break above a key downtrend line had stalled its
upward momentum.
 ""We saw a decent comeback in the euro in the past week, so
there's been some profit taking on that move,"" said Kasper
Kirkegaard, currency strategist at Danske in Copenhagen.
 ""There's some nervousness in the market, and prices are
rising on risky assets.""
 By 1041 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.5 percent on the day to
$1.2572, easing from $1.2723 hit on Friday.
 
 JAPAN ELECTION
 Some in the market said the euro had been knocked by a
weekend German magazine report that stress tests would include a
haircut on German sovereign debt under certain conditions, as it
followed reports last week that the tests would exempt German
haircuts.
 Analysts said the efficacy of the stress tests would depend
on how much detail they include, and the possibility the results
may be thin on in-depth information was weighing on the euro.
 The single currency was also under selling pressure after
its failure late last week to rise above a downtrend line drawn
through the euro's high hit in December and an April peak, and
resistance is now seen just above $1.2700.
 The dollar index, which tracks its performance versus
a basket of other currencies, rose 0.5 percent, recovering from
a slide to 83.622 on Friday, its weakest since May 10.
 The latest figures on IMM speculative positions show a
significant trimming in net long dollar positions last week,
which some analysts say may open the door to a dollar recovery
as investors start to rebuild long positions.
 Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.2 percent at 88.70 yen
, having climbed as high as around 89.15 yen.
 The yen initially suffered after Japan's ruling coalition,
led by Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan,
lost its upper house majority in an election on Sunday, putting
at risk efforts to deal with the country's debt.
 Tokyo traders said the election outcome triggered unwinding
in long yen positions, which rose significantly last week.
 U.S. earnings, in addition to data on inflation, retail
sales and manufacturing, will be the highlight of the week given
growing speculation the U.S. economy may be stumbling.
 Some analysts expect a mixed reading on the economy. But
given lingering banking sectors problems in the euro zone, they
were divided on whether the dollar would continue to suffer on
weak data or climb on strong economic readings.
 ""It remains to be seen how markets will weigh up poor
prospects for financials and sovereigns in Europe against
mounting fiscal and cyclical concerns in the US,"" Citi analysts
said in a note.
 They added that G3 currencies would underperform more solid
peripheral ones in volatile trade in the near term.

 By David Milliken and Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Britain's recession was deeper
than previously thought, new data showed on Monday, while a top
central banker warned that euro zone weakness and looming
government spending cuts could send the recovery into reverse.
 ""There is a chance we could slip back into recession. I hope
it is not the case,"" Bank of England policymaker Adam Posen told
Newcastle-based regional newspaper The Journal. ""There is going
to be a lot of drag on the economy, with the problems of the
eurozone and the public sector contraction in the UK.""
 Without state expenditure to prop it up, the economy would
probably have shrunk again in the first quarter, and net trade
proved an unexpectedly large drag after exports fell at their
fastest pace in a year and imports surged.
 Britain's first-quarter current account deficit swelled to
twice economists' forecasts, reaching its highest level since
the third quarter of 2007. The first glimpse of second-quarter
data shows service sector output fell 0.3 percent in April.
 The Office for National Statistics confirmed that Britain's
economy grew just 0.3 percent in the first three months of 2010
compared to 0.4 percent in late 2009.
 As part of a major annual revision of gross domestic product
data, the ONS also said that Britain's economy contracted by 6.4
percent between the second quarter of 2008 and the third quarter
of 2009, more than the 6.2 percent formerly estimated.
 The fall was the biggest since quarterly records began in
1955 and wiped 22 billion pounds ($33 billion) off the economy
-- 2 billion more than previously thought.
 The pound fell further against the euro  and the
dollar  after the data was released, and gilt futures
 pared losses as traders took the view that the data made
a Bank of England interest rate rise more distant.
 ""With fiscal austerity being stepped up, and consumer
spending growth still falling, there is significant reason for
concern over the UK's growth prospects,"" James Knightley,
economist at ING, said.
 Britain's government has announced a programme of fiscal
tightening that requires spending cuts of 25 percent over the
next four years for departments other than health and overseas
aid, plus benefit cuts and tax rises.
 Concern those cuts could drag the economy back into
recession were compounded after Monday's data also showed growth
in the first quarter of 2010 depended more heavily on government
spending than initially estimated.
 Government spending rose 1.5 percent on the quarter, three
times faster than previously thought, and at its fastest rate
since the end of 2008 to add 0.4 percent to GDP.
 Gross capital formation -- mostly business investment --
added 0.9 percent to GDP, more than offset by a 0.9 percent drag
from net exports and a 0.1 percent fall in household spending.
 
 Q2 ACCELERATION?
 Despite the weak April services reading, which some
economists said may be down to Iceland's volcanic ash cloud
disrupting air travel, analysts expect GDP may have grown faster
in the second quarter of 2010, before slowing again.
 ""Surveys suggest that GDP should have expanded more strongly
in Q2, perhaps by 0.5-0.6 percent. At the same time, though, the
timeliest indicators of activity have levelled off or even
started to weaken,"" said Capital Economics' Vicky Redwood.
 While a fall of more than 20 percent in the value of the
pound since mid-1997 has boosted the competitiveness of British
exports, austerity measures in parts of the euro zone limit the
prospects of growth driven by foreign demand.
 ""Today's releases highlighted the fragile nature of the
recovery so far,"" said Redwood. ""We still doubt that the economy
is in a good position to withstand the fiscal squeeze.""
 The ONS gave little detail about its reason for delaying the
publication of GDP data, which was initially due to be released
on June 30. It announced less than 24 hours before the data was
due that publication would be delayed because of ""potential
errors"" in some of the figures.
 ""It would be misleading to say the effect fell in any one
area,"" an ONS statistician told reporters on Monday.
 The current account balance showed a sharp swing into a
deficit of 9.628 billion pounds or 2.7 percent of GDP.
 Most of the swing was caused by a big rise in foreign
earnings on direct investment in Britain, which rose to 11.942
billion pounds from 4.253 billion, as foreign banks repatriated
earnings after their British subsidiaries returned to profit.
 The goods trade deficit edged up to 21.657 billion pounds
from 21.108 billion, its highest since Q4 2008.
 ""The figures are of course volatile on a quarter-to-quarter
basis, but a current account deficit of this size at this stage
of the cycle does not make for happy reading, especially at a
time when the economy is supposed to be gaining a better degree
of external balance,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw.

 By Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE, July 12 (Reuters) - Consumer price growth ground to
a halt in the European Union's emerging East in June, data
showed on Monday, which analysts said would keep interest rates
low in the mid-term and could push down some short-term bond
yields.
 Policymakers across central and Eastern Europe are walking a
fine line between nurturing a fragile economic recovery while
cutting back swollen budget deficits and public debt with
reforms that are expected to bear down on inflation.
 Interest rates are at record lows in the Czech Republic,
Romania, Poland and Hungary, but rather than return to
tightening at the end of the year as many analysts had expected,
the outlook increasingly points to central banks saying put.
 Czech prices were flat in June from the previous month and
up 1.2 percent versus a year earlier, at the bottom off the
Czech central bank's 1-3 percent target range. Analysts had
forecast 0.2 percent and 1.3 percent price growth, respectively.
 Romanian data showed a similar development, with zero price
growth from the previous month and inflation of 4.4 percent on
an annual basis.
 ""There are no signs of inflation pressures anywhere,"" said
Neil Shearing, an economist at London-based Capital Economics.
 The slight decline in Czech inflation came despite better
than expected unemployment figures. The jobless rate fell to 8.5
percent in June, from 8.7 a month earlier and analysts'
forecasts for 8.6.
 The Czech data supported comments made last week by central
bank Governor Miroslav Singer, who said interest rates would
remain at record lows longer than previously expected.
[ID:nPRA005131]
 A similar development was seen in euro zone member Slovakia,
where price growth was flat on the month while in Bulgaria,
which is still struggling to exit recession, monthly price falls
accelerated. [ID:nLDE66B0JV]
 The trend is expected to continue in Hungarian and Polish
data -- the latter of which is expected to show inflation at a
34-month low -- due on Tuesday. 
 
 BOND YIELDS DOWN
 Weak domestic demand and fiscal tightening in Romania and
the Czech Republic is expected to keep price pressure low, even
though Bucharest has agreed to hike value added tax this year.
 Another factor is currencies. The region is expected to
track the euro weaker against the dollar but appreciate against
the single currency by as much as 8 percent for the Polish zloty
in the next 12 months , a factor that keep price
pressures subdued.  [ID:nLAG006331]
 Capital Economics expects Czech, Hungarian and Romanian
interest rates to stay put until 2012, while most analysts see
Polish rates rising at the end of the year.
 That could also help push short-term bond yields lower,
possibly counterbalancing jittery investors who have demanded
higher premium on Romanian, Hungarian, and other emerging
European debt because of fears over EU economic stability.
 ""The data can possibly mean that bond yields could drop a
little bit, due to the inflation outlook, among other factors,""
said David Marek, chief economist of Patria Finance.
 The yield on the Czech two-year government benchmark
 slipped five basis points following the inflation
data to 1.815 percent.

Monday.
 The ONS left first-quarter GDP growth unrevised at 0.3

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped after
hitting a two-week peak on Monday while the euro fell broadly as
investors grew cautious ahead of a slew of key U.S. corporate
earnings and details of tests on European banks' financial
health.
 The yen briefly slipped after Japan's ruling coalition lost
its upper house majority in Sunday's election, putting the
government's policies to deal with the country's massive debt at
risk.
 While second-quarter earnings are expected to come in
strong, investors stayed cautious as companies, especially in
Europe, could struggle because of government belt-tightening to
combat high debt and budget deficits.
 ""The austerity measures and the slowdown in major markets
will probably force companies to be a little bit cautious on
their outlook and that will probably have an effect on the
market in the short term,"" said Mark Bon, fund manager at Canada
Life.
The MSCI world equity index was down 0.15 percent, having
hit a two-week high of 280.79. The Thomson Reuters global stock
index was down 0.1 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index also ticked down on the day while
emerging stocks rose 0.1 percent.
 Wall Street was set for a weaker open with U.S. stock
futures falling 0.4 percent. This week's key earnings include
Alcoa, Intel, JP Morgan, Google, Bank of America, GE and Citi.
 Thomson Reuters data shows earnings of S&P 500 firms are
expected to grow 27 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months, after expanding at a rate of 58.3 percent
in the January-March period. 
 So far, with 26 of 500 firms already reported, 69 percent of
earnings are coming above expectations.
 
 EURO WOBBLES
 The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.2570, pulling away from last
week's two-month high as concerns about the effectiveness of
stress tests on European banks prompted investors to trim long
positions in the single currency.
 Bund futures rose 47 ticks, drawing safe-haven bids.

 The results of the stress tests are due on July 23.
 ""Only a test that takes into account all potential outcomes
will convince the financial markets,"" Commerzbank said in a
note.
 ""Even though a default of a euro-area member state is very
improbable, it should be part of the test scenario. After all, a
dire scenario is a key element of a stress test, which aims, in
the end, to give an impression of the worst possible outcome.""
 The yen stabilised at 88.60 per dollar, erasing losses made
after Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Democratic Party of Japan lost
its upper house majority less than a year after it swept to
power promising change.
 The Democrats still control the more powerful lower house,
but they need help from other parties to push bills through the
upper house as they struggle to end decades of stagnation in the
world's No.2 economy and to cut the massive public debt.
 The dollar rose half a percent against a basket of major
currencies.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the dollar
on Monday, pulling away from a two-month high as concerns about
the effectiveness of stress tests on European banks prompted
investors to trim long positions in the single currency.
 The yen pared initial losses after Japanese election results
that showed political uncertainty ahead.
 The dollar rose across the board, recovering from a fall
against a currency basket late last week to its lowest since
early May, as investors crept into dollar-denominated assets, a
common occurrence during times of risk aversion.
 Investors awaited more details on stress tests on 91

from U.S. firms, which kick off this week, to gauge the health
of firms after a weak run of economic data has raised
speculation the economic recovery may be losing momentum.
 Many investors expect a solid earnings season.
 By 0755 GMT, the euro had fallen half a percent on the day
to $1.4975, easing from $1.2723 hit on Friday, its strongest
since early May.

 Some in the market said the euro had been knocked by a
weekend German magazine report that the stress tests would
include a haircut on German sovereign debt under certain
conditions, as it followed reports last week that the tests
would not include German haircuts.
 The single currency was also under selling pressure after

a slide to 83.622 on Friday, its weakest since May 10.
 It rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 88.85 yen, having
climbed as high as around 89.15 yen, its highest in roughly two
weeks in Asian trade.

 * Market takes announcement in stride
(Adds background, comments and market reaction, paras 3-11)
 TOKYO, July 12 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's may lower
Japan's sovereign ratings if the government's fiscal position
erodes further or there is a lack of concrete measures aimed at
fiscal consolidation, the ratings agency said on Monday.
 S&P said in a statement that stabilising the political
environment is a key challenge for Japan to implement meaningful
and sustainable fiscal consolidation following Japan's upper
house election on Sunday.
 Japanese government bonds and the yen took S&P's statement in
their stride. Lead September 10-year JGB futures stood at 141.50
in evening session trade, after finishing the day's session 0.24
point higher at 141.45.
 The yen was hovering near 89 yen to the dollar and last stood
at 88.85 yen, down 0.2 percent from late U.S. trading on Friday.
 Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Naoto Kan's
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), lost its upper house majority in
Sunday's election, putting Kan's policies to deal with the
country's massive debt at risk.
 ""As a result, a hung parliament is the most likely outcome,
as leaders of opposition parties are rejecting the possibility of
joining the coalition. A hung parliament would make it very
difficult for the government to push through major policies,"" S&P
said.
 ""As such, structural reforms, including those of the public
sector and public pension system, and increases in the
consumption tax rate will be difficult to implement in the new
political landscape, and thus, potentially act as a negative
factor on the sovereign ratings,"" it added.
 S&P said the DPJ's party leadership election scheduled to be
held in September 2010, could also affect government policy.
 ""Although Prime Minister Naoto Kan expressed his
determination not to resign after the election, he may be
pressured to change the current leadership to take responsibility
for the election outcome, and this could destabilize the
leadership of the DPJ as well as the government,"" it said.
 S&P, which threatened in January to cut Japan's credit rating
unless it produced a credible plan to rein in its soaring debt
and lift growth in an economy plagued by persistent deflation,
said it would consider revising the outlook for Japan's ratings
to stable if the government consolidates its political
foundations and takes concrete measures for fiscal consolidation.
 S&P cut its outlook on Japan's long-term sovereign debt
rating to negative from stable in January, while maintaining its
AA long-term and A-1+ short-term local and foreign currency
sovereign credit ratings.

 SYDNEY, July 12 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Monday as
investors counted on the start of the U.S. earnings season this
week to show firms were reaping strong profits and that the
world's economic recovery was not losing steam.
 Investors largely shrugged off the chance that Japan, the
world's No. 2 economy, may be trapped in a policy gridlock
after the ruling government lost a key poll on Sunday. Both the
yen and Tokyo's Nikkei average <.N225> dipped, but investors
said the election result was largely priced in and would have
only a limited impact.
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.3 percent, adding on to its 4.8 percent
gain last week. That had been its best week in over seven

as well, with stocks in Britain <.FTSE>, Germany <.GDAXI> and
France <.FCHI> seen rising 0.5 to 0.6 percent.

about $11 billion as Asia-Pacific chief executive of RCM in
Hong Kong.
 Indeed, ThomsonReuters data suggested upcoming U.S.
corporate results should have a decent showing.
 Earnings on the S&P 500 are seen to have grown 27 percent

 Oil was down 0.5 percent at $75.69 , having hit a
near two week high on Friday, while gold prices  dipped
but still held above $1,200 an ounce.
 POLICY GRIDLOCK?
 In Japan, the Nikkei stock index vacillated between gains
and losses on Monday. Yet moves either way were modest,
suggesting investors were not particularly worried about the
government's latest setback.
 Japan's ruling coalition government, under Prime Minister
Naoto Kan, had lost an upper house election on Sunday that
could prevent it from passing laws smoothly in future.
 With Japan already saddled with one of the world's largest
public debts by proportion of its economy, many analysts had
said Sunday's loss threatens Kan's job and puts into doubt the
government's ability to urgently cut debt.
 ""It's political paralysis,"" said Gerry Curtis, a professor
at Columbia University. ""Kan is not going to quit and it's
going to be very difficult to govern.""
 By the close, the Nikkei average was down 0.4 percent,
having risen as much as 0.5 percent during the day.
 The yen eased a touch but even traders said the move was
likely to be short-lived because the market was more focused on
the impending U.S. earnings season.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the softer yen to 88.90
yen  [USD/]. Japanese government bond yields, defying
expectations for a rise, edged lower. [JP/]
 ""The market appears to have priced in the government losing
its majority beforehand,"" said Atsushi Ito, a fixed-income
strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG in Tokyo.
 ""But it still remains to be seen how the market digests
policy implications going forward.""
 Selling pressure seemed modest, especially in light of the
yen and Nikkei's recent strong performances.
 The yen had rallied to seven-month highs against the dollar
on July 1, while the Nikkei had just managed its best
performance in about seven months last week.

 Oil was down 0.5 percent at $75.69, having hit a near two
week high on Friday, while gold prices dipped but still held
above $1,200 an ounce.
 POLICY GRIDLOCK?
 In Japan, the Nikkei stock index vacillated between gains
and losses on Monday. Yet moves either way were modest,
suggesting investors were not particularly worried about the
government's latest setback.
 Japan's ruling coalition government, under Prime Minister
Naoto Kan, had lost an upper house election on Sunday that
could prevent it from passing laws smoothly in future.
 With Japan already saddled with one of the world's largest
public debts by proportion of its economy, many analysts had
said Sunday's loss threatens Kan's job and puts into doubt the
government's ability to urgently cut debt.
 ""It's political paralysis,"" said Gerry Curtis, a professor
at Columbia University. ""Kan is not going to quit and it's
going to be very difficult to govern.""
 By the close, the Nikkei average was down 0.4 percent,
having risen as much as 0.5 percent during the day.
 The yen eased a touch but even traders said the move was
likely to be short-lived because the market was more focused on
the impending U.S. earnings season.
 The dollar rose 0.3 percent against the softer yen to 88.90
yen. Japanese government bond yields, defying expectations for
a rise, edged lower.
 ""The market appears to have priced in the government losing
its majority beforehand,"" said Atsushi Ito, a fixed-income
strategist at Morgan Stanley MUFG in Tokyo.
 ""But it still remains to be seen how the market digests
policy implications going forward.""
 Selling pressure seemed modest, especially in light of the
yen and Nikkei's recent strong performances.
 The yen had rallied to seven-month highs against the dollar
on July 1, while the Nikkei had just managed its best
performance in about seven months last week.

 * Analysts already price in more rate hikes
(Updates with details, analyst's comment, markets)
 By Kim Yeon-hee
 SEOUL, July 12 (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank on
Monday lifted its economic growth and inflation forecasts for
this year, supporting market expectations of more interest rate
increases soon after a last week's surprise hike.
 The Bank of Korea said in a statement that Asia's
fourth-largest economy would grow 5.9 percent this year after
barely averting contraction last year. The forecast comes after
a 5.2 percent rise predicted before and is the second upgrade
in three months.
 Exports are growing faster than previously expected as the
world economy keeps on recovering, prompting South Korean
companies to invest more in their factories, central bank data
showed.
 It was just above the government's recently upgraded
projection for 5.8 percent growth and came around the middle of
forecasts from economists, although the largely anticipated
upgrade did not move financial markets by much.
 ""Along with a steady recovery in the global economy,
contributions from the private sector to growth have been
rising and maintaining the growth momentum, with exports
leading economic recovery,"" Lee Sang-woo, a director general at
the central bank, told reporters.
 The finance ministry lifted its growth forecast on June 24
and said it would gradually shift policy back to normal.
 On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the central bank said gross
domestic product would probably expand by a seasonally adjusted
0.7 percent this quarter after growing by an estimated 1.2
percent in the second quarter.
 ADDITIONAL TIGHTENING SEEN AHEAD
 The central bank raised its forecast for this year's
inflation to 2.8 percent from the previous 2.6 percent, with
the projection for the second half of the year lifted to 3
percent from 2.7 percent.
 The Bank of Korea has set a target of keeping the annual
consumer price index growth at between 2.0 percent and 4.0
percent on average for the 2010-2012 period.
 The three-year treasury bond futures September contract
held largely steady, falling 0.03 point to 110.25 by 0251 GMT,
while the won was down 0.1 percent to 1,197.3 per dollar.
 ""Looking into the statement released after the monetary
policy decision (on Friday), the Bank of Korea appeared to
leave the door open for another rate hike in August,"" Yeom
Sang-hoon, a fixed-income analyst at SK Securities.
 ""Today's numbers are mostly in line with policymakers'
views unveiled recently and hardly change the situation.""
 The economy has pulled out of the 2007/2008 crisis ahead of
most others and has already been tipped enjoy the fastest
growth next to Turkey this year among members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 The central bank slightly lowered its forecast for next
year's growth to 4.5 percent from 4.8 percent projected in
April mainly in reaction to an increased projection for this
year.
 The Bank of Korea raised interest rates on Friday for the
first time since the outbreak of the financial crisis and
cemented market expectations of more tightening by predicting
solid growth and higher inflation ahead.
 It lifted its base rate to 2.25 percent from a record-low
of 2.0 percent, joining the likes of Australia, India, Taiwan
and Malaysia in starting to return policy to pre-crisis mode as
Asia-Pacific leads the global recovery.
 Analysts surveyed by Reuters on Friday forecast that the
Bank of Korea would raise rates by another 50 basis points by
the end of the year with a 25 basis point rise in August or
September.

 * Long liquidation in yen, Japan importer yen selling cited
 * But yen drop on poll result seen likely to be short-lived
 * Focus turning to U.S. corporate earnings
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 12 (Reuters) - The yen eased on Monday after
election results showed political uncertainty lay ahead for
Japan, but the move was likely to be short-lived with attention
turning the U.S. earnings season as a gauge of risk appetite.
 Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Naoto Kan's
Democratic Party of Japan, lost its upper house majority over the
weekend, putting Kan's policies to check the country's massive
debt at risk.
 Although the DPJ has a dominant grip on the more powerful
lower house, the election outcome makes policy stalemate more
likely.
 Market players said the election outcome helped trigger
yen-selling, including likely long liquidation in the yen. One
trader cited dollar buying against the yen by hedge funds.
 Such flows, together with Japanese importer demand for the
dollar, helped push the dollar higher against the yen, market
players said.
 But traders said focal points in the near-term were the start
of the U.S. earnings season this week and the results of stress
test at European banks due later in July, adding that yen-selling
pressure stemming solely from the upper house election result was
likely to be limited in scope and duration.
 ""I think we may see a move toward 90 yen to the dollar and
that may be it,"" said a trader for a Japanese bank, adding that
long liquidation in the yen seemed to be the main reason behind
the yen's dip on Monday.
 The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the yen to 89.07 yen,
pulling away from a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit on trading
platform EBS in early July.
 On daily Ichimoku charts, the dollar faces resistance near
89.55 yen, roughly where the kijun sen now lies.
 Overall, the Tokyo market reaction to the election was
subdued, with the benchmark Nikkei average little changed on the
day, and 10-year Japanese government bond futures eking out a
small gain.
 The latest U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
data showed that currency speculators increased their long
positions in the yen to 37,926 contracts in the week that ended
July 6, up from 27,427 contracts in the previous period.
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent against the yen to 112.23 yen.
 Against the dollar, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.2598.
Resistance is seen near $1.2715/20, the trendline from the
December high.
 The euro had touched a two-month high of $1.2723 on Friday,
supported by strong German data, some clarity on European bank
stress tests and a turnaround in appetite towards riskier assets.
 Indeed, the latest CFTC data showed speculators had decreased
bets against the euro to 38,909 contracts, from 73,670 contracts.
 Traders said they will eye how a Greek debt auction goes this
week for more direction on the euro. The debt-laden country plans
to auction six-month treasury bills on July 13.
 The dollar index rose 0.3 percent to 84.225, pulling away
from a two-month low of 83.622 hit on Friday. The greenback has
been under pressure since early last week, hurt by growing
worries about a slowdown in the U.S and easing concerns about the
euro zone.
 ""From their June 8 peak, dollar net longs have tumbled by 80
percent,"" wrote David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC
Capital.
 ""Along the way, the dollar index has dropped from over 88 to
below 85. Much of the most recent drop seems due to a successful
Spanish bond auction, though yield spreads are working against
the dollar and are an underlying factor at play too.""
 The U.S. earnings season begins with Alcoa Inc after the
closing bell on Monday. Analysts are expecting overall
second-quarter earnings to grow by 27 percent, according to
Thomson Reuters data. That is up from the 22.4 percent that
analysts were anticipating at the beginning of the year..

(Updates with U.S. markets' close)
 By Walter Brandimarte
 NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday,
recording their best week in nearly a year, while oil prices climbed
on hopes that U.S. companies will report strong earnings next week.
 But investors were still cautious in the run-up to the earnings
season, buying U.S. dollars and gold, which rallied more than 1
percent. The earnings season starts on Monday, when Alcoa , one
of the 30 stocks in the Dow, reports after the closing bell.
 Wall Street ended the session near the day's highs, but volume
was the lowest of the year.
 The three major U.S. stock indexes traded flat to modestly higher
for most of the session, with brief forays into negative territory as
investors remained cautious due to fears of a double-dip recession.
 But late in the afternoon, buyers scooped up some beaten-down
U.S. stocks in anticipation of a healthy earnings season and a sharp
rally took shape in the final hour.
 ""Everyone is anxious to see whether earnings are good enough to
outweigh some of the more significant macroeconomic trends we're
facing,"" said Jordan Posner, senior portfolio manager at Matrix Asset
Advisors in New York.
 ""Everyone is marking time until we get some numbers,"" he added.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.61 percent
during the session, boosting its weekly gain to 5.1 percent -- the
highest since the 6.6 percent increase recorded in the week ending
July 18, 2009.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares also
finished Friday's session with a 0.61 percent to end at 1,021.78. For
the week, the index rose 5.4 percent, its biggest weekly advance
since July 2009. Shares of miners and metal producers led gains on
hopes for strong demand from China and positive quarterly results
from U.S. aluminium giant Alcoa.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained 59.04 points, or
0.58 percent, to end at 10,198.03, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> rose 7.71 points, or 0.72 percent, to finish at
1,077.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> gained 21.05 points, or
0.97 percent, to close at 2,196.45.
 Alcoa's stock jumped 2.1 percent to $10.94. Google Inc 
climbed 2.4 percent to $467.46 after Beijing gave it the green light
to continue operating its China search page.
 But sentiment remained fragile as many investors worry the global
economy could slip back into recession. Even with the gains of the
last four days, the S&P 500 is still down 11.5 percent from its most
recent closing high in late April. For an analysis on fears of a
double dip, see [ID:nN08225491].
 Underscoring the rise of concerns about the global economy, fund
tracker EPFR reported on Thursday that equity funds worldwide had
outflows of more than $11 billion in the first week of July.
[ID:nTOE668038]
 Money market funds, considered as a safer investment alternative,
received $33.5 billion during the same week, their largest inflows in
18 months.
 EURO RESUMES SLIDE
 The euro fell against the dollar as investors pocketed some
proceeds from the rally that had taken the single currency to its
highest level in more than two months.
 Traders said the euro was unable to remain above the key
resistance level of $1.27 due to lingering worries about the
euro-zone economy.
 ""Since the $1.1877 June low, the euro has rallied an impressive
6.1 percent,"" said Camilla Sutton, a currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto. ""However, near-term risks continue to loom and we
will see another bout of euro weakness.""
 The single European currency  was down 0.41 percent at
$1.2641 from a previous session close of $1.2693.
 On Thursday, the single currency got a lift after Jean-Claude
Trichet, the European Central Bank president, said the euro zone's
economy performed much better in the second quarter. However, he also
said the region would grow ""at a moderate and still uneven pace in an
environment of high uncertainty.""
 The dollar was also up against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.18 percent.
 Against the Japanese yen, the greenback  was up 0.25
percent at 88.60.
 U.S. Treasury prices fell as the rally in global stocks reduced
the safe-haven allure of government bonds. Investors also unloaded
some government debt on Friday to makde room for $69 billion worth of
coupon-bearing supply next week.
 The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $35 billion in three-year
debt on Monday, $21 billion in 10-year notes on Tuesday and $13
billion in 30-year bonds on Wednesday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down
6/32 in price, with the yield at 3.0592 percent.
 U.S. crude oil  rose 65 cents, or 0.86 percent to settle at
$76.09 per barrel -- the highest settlment since the close at $75.63
on June 30. For the week, crude oil futues gained 5.5 percent -- the
most since late May.
 In Friday's session, gold prices rose more than 1 percent.
 Some investors were cautious about the U.S. earnings season and
others found the metal attractively priced. Spot gold  jumped
1.14 percent, to $1,210.00 an ounce.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - A rally that pushed the euro
to its highest level in more than two months stalled on Friday
and the currency slipped on technical factors, with some
investors betting the recent move was too far, too fast.
 The euro touched $1.2723 earlier in the session on
electronic trading platform EBS, its highest level since early
May. The currency was supported by strong German factory data,
a positive U.S. jobs report and more clarity on European bank
stress tests.
 ""The euro tested but did not break technical resistance
levels overnight and has subsequently given up a share of its
recent gains,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist
at Wells Fargo Bank in New York.
 ""While there have not been any obvious catalysts for the
euro's pullback this morning, the speed of the move suggests
the underlying sentiment on the currency remains negative,"" he
added.
 In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro traded down
0.4 percent at $1.2637, after reaching $1.2722 according to
Reuters data. The total gain for the week was 0.7 percent at
current prices.
 Some Asian central banks were seen willing to reestablish
long euro/dollar positions above $1.2750 because a clear breach
of $1.2730 would suggest the downtrend had been broken.
 But despite the recent rally in the European single
currency, the euro zone's debt problems have discouraged most
investors from taking long positions in the euro.
 ""There is still a risk that euro shorts get covered and the
bounce extends, but it is no more than that -- a short-term
bounce,"" said Adam Cole, global head of foreign exchange
strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 That view was reflected in the gap between one-month risk
reversals, which have fallen nearly 55 basis points to
0.85/1.35 percent since end-June, and one-year risk reversals,
which have shed 25 basis points.
 This indicates traders are willing to pay a higher premium
to buy the right to sell the euro in coming months.
 Ian Stannard, a foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas,
said that increased demand for high-yielding commodity
currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars would
also hit the euro, which has come to be seen as a funding
currency.
 CANADIAN DOLLAR RISES
 One of Friday's biggest movers was the Canadian dollar,
which surged around 1 percent against the greenback on a
stronger-than-expected improvement in jobless figures.
 The U.S. dollar traded down at C$1.0334, after hitting its
lowest since late June.
 The Canadian figures mirror robust jobs data from Australia
earlier this week that drove the Australian dollar up more than
4 percent.
 Strong data has boosted hopes of a firmer global economic
recovery and raised pressure on the low-yielding yen as
investors cut long positions and shifted into high-beta
currencies like the Aussie and New Zealand dollars.
 Against the yen, the euro touched a two-week high earlier
of 112.69 yen on EBS and 112.67 on Reuters data after jumping
more than 1 percent on Thursday, but pared those gains to trade
last at 112.05 yen on Reuters.
 The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 88.64 yen.
 Currency analysts at Citigroup Inc said in a note a sharp
shift in positioning and a decisive move higher in rate
differentials in favor of the United States suggests dollar/yen
is poised for an up move in the near term.
 The dollar was down 0.9 percent against the South Korean
won after the U.N. Security Council on Friday condemned what it
called an attack leading to the sinking of a South Korean ship
in March, but in a concession to China stopped short of
explicitly blaming North Korea.

 NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday, on
track for their best week in nearly a year, on hopes that U.S.
companies will report strong earnings next week. But investors were
still cautious, buying the U.S. dollar and driving gold prices up
more than 1 percent.
 Trading on Wall Street was also volatile after three consecutive
sessions of strong gains, with many investors going for cash due torecurring fears of a double-dip recession and the upcoming earnings
season, which officially opens on Monday when Alcoa  reports.
 ""We are all holding our breath for earnings season to start,""
said Kim Caughey, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital
Group in Pittsburgh. ""Companies are very well positioned because
they're lightly staffed now and are very productive.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.4 percent

 EURO RESUMES SLIDE
 The euro fell against the dollar as investors pocketed part of
the rally that had taken the single currency to its highest level in
more than two months.
 Traders said the euro was unable to remain above the key
resistance level of $1.27 due to lingering worries about the
euro-zone economy.
 ""Since the $1.1877 June low, the euro has rallied an impressive
6.1 percent,"" said Camilla Sutton, a currency strategist at Scotia
Capital in Toronto. ""However, near-term risks continue to loom and we
will see another bout of euro weakness.""
 The single European currency  was down 0.46 percent at
$1.2635 from a previous session close of $1.2693.
 On Thursday, the single currency got a lift after Jean-Claude
Trichet, the European Central Bank president, said the euro zone's
economy performed much better in the second quarter. However, he also
said the region would grow ""at a moderate and still uneven pace in an
environment of high uncertainty.""
 The dollar was also up against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.14 percent.
 Against the Japanese yen, the greenback  was up 0.16
percent at 88.52.
 U.S. Treasury prices fell as higher global stocks reduced the
safe-haven allure of government bonds but also because investors made
room for $69 billion worth of coupon-bearing supply next week.
 The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $35 billion in three-year
debt on Monday, $21 billion in 10-year notes on Tuesday and $13
billion in 30-year bonds on Wednesday.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was down
6/32 in price, with the yield at 3.0574 percent.
 Gold prices rose back above $1,210 an ounce. Some investors were
cautious about the U.S. earnings season and others found the metal
attractively priced. Spot gold  jumped 1.07 percent, to
$1,209.20 an ounce.
 U.S. crude oil prices  rose 19 cents, or 0.25 percent, to
$75.63 per barrel.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2010 12:44PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Gloom starts to lift in euro zone crisis," * Policy makers starting to sound more upbeat
 * Emergency steps beginning to convince markets
* Many risks, uncertainties remain

 By Timothy Heritage 
 BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - Gloom over the future of the
euro zone is starting to lift after months of crisis, with
policy makers sounding increasingly confident that the worst is
over.
 There are still plenty of risks. Economic growth is fragile,
governments must keep the political will to impose austerity
steps for years to come, and small banks in the hardest-hit
countries remain unable to borrow in the markets, making them
dependent on the European Central Bank for funds.
 But in the past several days financial markets have reacted
positively to details of planned stress tests on European banks,
while sales of Spanish and Portuguese government debt have seen
strong demand. European bank shares have rallied almost 10
percent and the euro hit a seven-week high versus the dollar.
 ""This has been the most difficult six months in the history
of the European Union,"" European Commission President Jose
Manuel Barroso said this week. ""There has been a stress test on
the EU and on our ability to work together.""
 But he made clear that he believed Europe had come through
that test, and his political rivals in the European Parliament,
the European Socialists, for once appeared to agree with him.
 ""The speculative attack against the euro has been slowed
down. The speculators are seeing the EU is protecting its
currency,"" Socialist leader Martin Schulz told the assembly.
 
 EMERGENCY STEPS
 A major factor worrying markets in the first half of this
year was the difficulty which euro zone states had in agreeing
on how to stave off debt defaults by countries on the southern
periphery of the region.
 The political and ideological differences between
governments have not all been resolved. But most aspects of an
emergency mechanism to handle the crisis are now in place, and
the EU has at least started efforts to address the long-term
causes of its debt crisis.
 A 110 billion euro ($140 billion) bailout of Greece, agreed
in early May, is buying time for Athens to reform its finances.
The launch of a European Financial Stability Facility, which
could borrow up to 440 billion euros to help struggling
countries, has been delayed by the resistance of tiny Slovakia,
but strong diplomatic efforts seem likely to overcome that
obstacle this month.
 While there is scepticism about how accurate the EU's stress
tests of its banks will be, the unprecedented decision to test
91 institutions and publish results for individual banks
suggests the bloc is more serious about confronting the problem
than it was just weeks ago.
 The 27-country EU has also set up a task force to review its
budget rules, tighten fiscal discipline and increase economic
policy coordination.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet signalled on Thursday that
he felt these measures were beginning to restore markets'
confidence, saying the central bank might lean towards cutting
back further its emergency programme of buying government bonds.
 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde told U.S.
broadcaster PBS on Wednesday that the worst was over.
 ""We are in the middle of the beginning of the end. The
crisis has really hit its peak,"" she said.
 
 SPREADS STILL HIGH
 Prices in several key markets show investors are still
nervous. The Spanish 10-year government bond yield remained a
very high 198 basis points above the equivalent German yield on
Friday, not far from a peak of 239 bps hit in mid-June; credit
default swaps for weak euro zone states, used to insure against
the risk of a debt default, have not come down much.
 That is because many investors still think a debt
restructuring by Greece or conceivably other euro zone states is
likely in the long term -- perhaps in a year or two, when policy
makers judge markets have recovered enough for a restructuring
to occur without destabilising the whole region.
 Another fear is that countries in the south of the euro zone
could slip back into recession this year as austerity measures
bite. This would weigh on the economic recovery of the whole
zone, though strong German data this week suggested it might not
end the recovery.
 Referring to the global financial crisis, Trichet said on
Friday: ""Events over the past few months have made it clear that
it is still too early to declare the crisis over.""
 Discord between France and Germany could yet stand in the
way of agreement on significant changes in the EU's budget
rules, enshrined in its Stability and Growth Pact.
 But ahead of regular talks on Monday between the 16 euro
zone finance ministers, the mood in EU policy-making circles is
clearly much more upbeat than it was before most of the
ministers' meetings this year.
 The European Policy Centre think tank noted this change in
mood in a report after the most recent summit of EU leaders on
June 17.
 ""For the first time since the start of the year, there was
no immediate crisis overshadowing their discussions, they were
able to stick to the pre-planned agenda and finish the one-day
meeting without going into overtime,"" it said.
 ""After a string of emergency meetings over the last few
months...this came as a huge relief.""

 * France should use G20 presidency to promote - Jouyet
 * System should link exchange rates to purchasing power
 
 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, July 9 (Reuters) - France will use its presidency of
the Group of 20 major world economies next year to work for a
global currency system that relates exchange rates to purchasing
power, the country's markets regulator said on Friday.
 In an interview with Reuters, Jean-Pierre Jouyet said the
United States and Japan could share with France an interest in
creating some sort of international monetary system despite
Washington's commitment to exchange rates being set by markets.
 ""At the heart of the G20 will be the monetary challenge --
how do you move from a G7-G8 world to a G20 in terms of exchange
rate regulation,"" said Jouyet, a former head of the French
Treasury and junior minister for European affairs.
 ""Apart from the French, those who believe in it when it's in
their interest are the Americans,"" he said.
 Japan too had a record of using currency market intervention
to keep the yen competitive, he said.
 Coordinated action to realign major world currencies last
occurred a decade ago when the U.S., European and Japanese
central banks intervened to stop the euro's decline after the
single European currency fell to a record low of 82.25 cents in
October 2000, the year after its launch.
 The euro now stands at around $1.25 after hitting a peak of
$1.6038 in July 2008.
 France has long favoured a managed currency to keep its
exports of aircraft and farm produce competitive. But for most
U.S., British and German policymakers, it is an article of faith
that markets should determine exchange rates freely.
 However, Jouyet said U.S. President Barack Obama would would
need relative exchange rate stability to achieve his economic
competitiveness and growth objectives in the second half of his
term.
 
 SNAKE OR BASKET
 The head of the French Markets Authority said the G20 could
consider some version of the European Union's monetary ""snake""
system, in which currencies were allowed to fluctuate within
bands, or China's idea of a reserve currency based on a basket
of major currencies.
 ""On the one side, you need to see what the parities are
compared to fundamentals, to purchasing power... On the other
side, the question that arises is how monetary exchanges are
organised in a new G20 world,"" Jouyet said.
 China would need to be convinced, but had shown it was
responsive to international concerns about the yuan by allowing
its exchange rate to rise slightly since last month.
 Jouyet said President Nicolas Sarkozy had the political
energy to give new momentum to the G20, which became the key
global economic leadership forum at the height of the financial
crisis in November 2008 when it began holding regular summits.
 Sarkozy said last year he wanted the major industrial and
emerging nations to discuss a ""multi-monetary"" international
currency system rather than one based on the dollar.
 Jouyet said the challenge was to get the major emerging
economies -- China, India, Brazil and South Africa -- to engage
more actively in economic policy cooperation rather than just
basking in their new-found status at the top table.
 ""The G20 is an enlargement of the G8 to include the big
emerging countries. They are the most silent, and it is their
indifference and refusal to engage that seems to me most
worrying,"" Jouyet said. ""We have given them the political
recognition but we haven't had the operational payback.""

 * Euro rally stalls; resistance above $1.27
 * High-yielders hold gains on improving outlook
 * Canada dollar surges on strong jobs data
 (Adds comments, details. Updates prices)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - A rally that pushed the euro
to its highest level in more than two months stalled on Friday
and the currency fell due largely to technical factors as
investors took profits before the weekend.
 The euro rose 1.3 percent this week and touched $1.2723
earlier in the session, its highest level since early May,
supported by strong German factory data, a positive U.S. jobs
report and more clarity on European bank stress tests.
 But traders said the single currency struggled to maintain
gains above $1.27, due to lingering worries about the euro zone
economy.
 ""The euro tested but did not break technical resistance
levels overnight and has subsequently given up a share of its
recent gains,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist
at Wells Fargo Bank in New York.
 ""While there have not been any obvious catalysts for the
euro's pullback this morning, the speed of the move suggests
the underlying sentiment on the currency remains negative,"" he
added.
 In late morning trading in New York, the euro erased
earlier gains to trade down 0.4 percent at $1.2645, after
reaching $1.2723 on trading platform EBS.
 Despite its recent rally, the euro zone's debt problems
have discouraged investors from taking long positions in the
euro. Some Asian central banks were seen willing to
re-establish long euro/dollar positions above $1.2750 because a
clear breach of $1.2730 would suggest the downtrend had been
broken.
 ""There is still a risk that euro shorts get covered and the
bounce extends but it is no more than that: a short-term
bounce,"" said Adam Cole, global head of foreign exchange
strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 That view was reflected in the gap between 1-month risk
reversals, which have fallen nearly 55 basis points to
0.85/1.35 percent since end-June, and 1-year risk reversals,
which have shed 25 basis points. This indicates traders are
willing to pay a higher premium to buy the right to sell the
euro in coming months. 
 Ian Stannard, a foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas,
said that increased demand for high-yielding commodity
currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars would
also hit the euro, which has come to be seen as a funding
currency.
 CANADIAN DOLLAR RISES
 One of Friday's biggest movers was the Canadian dollar,
which surged 1 percent against the greenback on a
stronger-than-expected improvement in jobless figures.
 The U.S. dollar was last trading lower at C$1.0323, its
lowest since late June.
 Canada's figures mirror robust jobs data from Australia
earlier this week that drove the Australian dollar up more than
4 percent.
 Strong data has boosted hopes of a firmer economic recovery
and raised pressure on the low-yielding yen as investors cut
long positions and shifted into high-beta currencies like the
Aussie and New Zealand dollars.
 The euro touched a two-week high earlier of 112.69 yen on
EBS after jumping more than 1 percent on Thursday but pared
those gains to trade last at 111.68 yen.
 The dollar was little changed at 88.44 yen.
 Currency analysts at Citigroup Inc. said in a note a sharp
shift in positioning and a decisive move higher in rate
differentials in favor of the United States suggests
dollar/yen is poised for an up move in the near term.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on

 * France keen to build ties with G20, OPEC member
 * Newspaper quote in June caused ""furore"" among Saudis
 
 By John Irish and Sophie Taylor
 PARIS, July 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has
postponed a visit to France that would have seen him open an
exhibition of Saudi's archaeological treasures at the Louvre
museum and possibly attend the July 14 national day festivities.
 A spokesman at the kingdom's embassy in Paris confirmed on
Friday that the visit had been postponed and a new date had not
yet been set. He declined to give further details.
 The Saudi monarch had been scheduled to meet President
Nicolas Sarkozy as the two countries look to develop their
relationship ahead of France taking over the G20 chairmanship
next year. Saudi Arabia is the only Arab member among the bloc
of leading economic powers.
 The world's largest oil exporter said on July 5 it was also
preparing to sign an agreement on cooperation in civilian
nuclear energy during the visit.
 Both countries have been in talks for more than one year but
have yet to disclose details about the cooperation.
 The Saudi spokesman declined to give a reason why the trip
had been postponed. The octogenarian has had a busy schedule in
the last few weeks. 
 He attended the G20 summit in Toronto, Canada at the end of
June, embarked on a state visit to Washington to hold talks with
President Obama on the Middle East peace process and flew to a
presidential retreat at the start of July in Morocco.
 
 GOOD RELATIONS?
 An article that appeared on the website of Le Figaro
newspaper on June 30, caused a ""furore"" among Saudi offcials,
French daily Le Monde reported on Friday, citing a source. 
 The king was quoted telling the defence minister that
neither Iran nor Israel had a right to exist. It was
subsequently denied on the official Saudi press agency.
 ""We have excellent relations with Saudi Arabia,"" French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero when asked on Friday
if relations between the two countries had soured. ""This is
speculation that casts not the slightest shadow on our excellent
relationship.""
 Valero said the visit had not been announced by either side,
suggesting it was not a state visit.
 France's relations with Saudi Arabia since Sarkozy came into
office have been mixed compared to with Riyadh's neighbours,
possibly down to the generation gap.
 Sarkozy has boosted both economic and political ties with
the world's largest producer of liquefied natural gas Qatar,
which itself has had a frosty relationship with Riyadh. Last
year, France set up a naval base in the United Arab Emirates.
 Still, Saudi Arabia's cabinet has given the green light to
sign a nuclear cooperation deal with France and at the start of
July, French engineer Alstom was shortlisted for a 10 billion
euro ($12.68 billion) contract to supply trains and equipment
for a high-speed railway linking Saudi Arabia's holy cities to
the Red Sea coast.

 * Lula calls for end of reliance on rich nations
 
 By Peroshni Govender
 PRETORIA, July 9 (Reuters) - South Africa and Brazil pledged
on Friday to deepen trade and commercial ties in another sign of
emerging countries gradually shifting their economic dependence
away from rich nations.
 At the end of a six-country tour of Africa -- his 12th trip
to the continent -- Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva
told South African counterpart Jacob Zuma that developing
economies had to tear down barriers to trade.
 ""I told Comrade Zuma that we do not need to fear each other.
We need to build things together. Then we will be less reliant
on others and can build a stronger economy,"" Lula said.
 Since coming to office in 2003, the former metal worker has
worked hard to boost trade between Brazil and Africa to $26
billion, a more than five-fold increase.
 Zuma praised Lula's commitment to the poorest continent,
which has enjoyed an unprecedented stretch of growth in the last
decade due to factors ranging from a boom in commodity prices,
increased foreign investment and official debt forgiveness.
 Under Lula, the number of Brazilian embassies in Africa has
doubled to 34.
 ""President Lula has prioritised relations with Africa.
Brazil has expanded its presence in Africa over the past 10
years,"" Zuma said.
 Brazil is South Africa's largest commercial partner in South
America, with trade of 19 billion rand in 2009, and both leaders
said those numbers were destined to rise.
 With Brazil gearing up to host the next soccer World Cup, in
2014, its leaders are also keen to learn from South Africa's
experience, particularly in overcoming the reputation for crime
and violence that bedevils Brazil as much as South Africa.
 ""People will go back with the conviction that South Africa
enchanted them. Brazil will continue to learn to hold an
unforgettable World Cup,"" Lula said.
 On previous legs of his African trip, Lula signed, among
other things, a defence accord with Equatorial Guinea, a
biofuels deal with Kenya and an environmental cooperation pact
with Tanzania.
 Despite Lula's push, Brazil still lags far behind China in
Africa, and while its trade with the continent has boomed, it
has fallen as a proportion of overall Brazilian commerce -- from
7 percent in 2008 to 5.6 percent in May this year.

 European national governments have approved the review. The
EU's executive European Commission has until July 22, when the
duties are due to expire, to launch the probe.
 The review will take up to 15 months, during which time the

 ""There was no opposition to the probe from EU member states.
It throws up the strategic question of whether Europe should let

 Solvay subsidiary Solvay and CPC Barium Strontium is
Europe's only producer of barium carbonate, which is used in the
production of glass, bricks, tiles and television screens.
 European glass and building products producers buy about 50
million euros ($63.4 million) of the product every year. Europe
is the most recent region to act against Chinese shipments of
the compound, following the United States, Brazil and India.

 * Unemployment rate drops to 7.9 pct from 8.1 pct
 * Services gain while goods sector sheds workers
 * June housing starts lower than expected
 * Poll shows July 20 rate hike expectations intact
(Adds details, comment from manufacturing sector)
 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, July 9 (Reuters) - Canada's economy created six
times more jobs than forecast in June, a near-record gain that
pressures the central bank to raise interest rates again this
month even as cracks in the U.S. recovery threaten to cool the
country's scorching growth.
 The staggering employment gain contradicts a recent string
of weaker data, including another report on Friday showing
housing starts fell in June.
 Statistics Canada said on Friday that employment surged by
93,200 in June, flying past market expectations for 15,000
jobs.
 In the past year, services sector job growth has more than
doubled that of the goods-producing sector. The trend continued
in June.
 Businesses are generally more confident about the domestic
economy than export markets, particularly the United States,
where demand for Canadian goods is faltering. That partly
explains why services like retail stores and wholesalers
created the most jobs in June, while factory owners dismissed
workers.
 The overall gains were the second largest on record after
the 108,700 reported in April. The labor market has now nearly
recovered the 417,000 jobs lost during the recession.
 Still, the unemployment rate is well above pre-recession
levels at 7.9 percent, though down from 8.1 percent in May.
 Even taking into account signs of slowing domestic growth,
the labor market strength reflects an expanding economy where
emergency low interest rates no longer make sense, analysts
said. The report increased expectations of a second consecutive
central bank rate hike on July 20.
 ""There is a lot of strength from top to bottom and so
clearly this is bond-bearish, it is Canadian dollar-positive,
and it argues for hikes not just in July but arguably beyond,""
said Eric Lascelles, chief Canada macro strategist at TD
Securities.
 The Canadian dollar surged to its strongest value since
late June after the data, hitting C$1.0296, or 97.13 U.S.
cents. Bond and money market yields also rose.

 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the Bank of Canada's key policy rate, are
pricing in an 84 percent likelihood of a July 20 rate hike.

 'GAME OF SUDOKU'
 It was tough to find any negative details in the employment
report, which showed strong private sector hiring and gains
split evenly between full-time and part-time positions.
 But market excitement about imminent rate hikes was
tempered by some skepticism about the sustainability of jobs
growth and a history of volatile Canadian employment data.
 Signs of fatigue in the U.S. recovery, European debt woes,
monetary tightening in China could all inflict collateral
damage on export-reliant Canada, where growth stalled in April
after seven straight months of expansion. [ID:nN07168558]
 Easing wage inflation pressures may also give the Bank of
Canada leeway to raise borrowing costs at a more leisurely
pace.
 Statscan said the average hourly wage of permanent
employees, watched by the Bank of Canada for inflation
pressure, rose 2 percent in June from a year earlier, down from
the 2.7 percent in May.
 ""Right now it's almost like a game of Sudoku in that the

about for Canada looking forward,"" said Tom Nakamura,
fixed-income portfolio manager at AGF Investments.
 ""My thoughts are that they will continue to embark on a
rate hike path ... the pace and timing will be uncertain,"" he
said.
 Friday's jobs report showed service industries did all the
hiring in June. Layoffs in manufacturing exerted a drag on the
goods-producing sector as factories shed 14,000 workers and
employment in that sector remained 11.9 percent below
pre-recession levels.
 Analysts said fears the U.S. may slip back into recession
were partly to blame for the factory layoffs. Jayson Myers,
president of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, said
uncertain market conditions ""led manufacturers to put new hires
on hold.""
 Separately, a less buoyant report showed housing starts
fell in June to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of
189,300 units from a revised 195,300 in May. This was below
analyst expectations, though May's numbers were revised up.
 The decline in starts is further evidence that the housing
market, which helped drive the recovery but was also feared to
be overheating, will slow in the second half.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
dollar on Friday, with investors taking profits ahead of the
weekend as a rally in the single currency ran out of steam once
it touched its highest level in more than two months.
 Traders said gains in the euro above $1.27, a key
resistance level, were unjustified due to lingering worries
about the euro zone economy.
 The euro was supported earlier this week by strong German
factory data [ID:nLDE6670ZL], a positive U.S. jobs report and
more clarity on European bank stress tests, all of which also
boosted demand for riskier assets such as shares and
higher-yielding currencies.
 ""Since the 1.1877 June low, the euro has rallied an
impressive 6.1 percent,"" said Camilla Sutton, a currency
strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. ""However, near-term
risks continue to loom and we will see another bout of euro
weakness.""
 In morning trading in New York, the euro erased gains to
trade down 0.6 percent at $1.2617 , after reaching a 2
1/2-month high of $1.2723 on trading platform EBS.
 ""The euro rebound is now running out of steam. It is facing
tough resistance at the $1.27 level,"" Ian Stannard, foreign
exchange strategist at BNP Paribas, said.
 BNP's Stannard said more demand for high-yielding commodity
currencies such as the Australian dollar would also hit the
euro, which has come to be seen as a funding currency. 
 ""This recent move (in the euro) has been caused by several
factors, not the least of which has been short covering,"" said
Sutton.
 But despite its recent rally, the euro zone's debt problems
have discouraged investors from taking long positions in the
euro.
 Some Asian central banks were seen willing to re-establish
long euro/dollar positions above $1.2750 because a clear breach
of $1.2730 would suggest the downtrend had been broken.
 ""There is still a risk that euro shorts get covered and the
bounce extends but it is no more than that: a short-term
bounce,"" said Adam Cole, global head of foreign exchange
strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
 That view was reflected in the gap between 1-month risk
reversals , which have fallen nearly 55 basis
points to 0.85/1.35 percent since end-June, and 1-year risk
reversals , which have shed 25 basis points. 
 This indicates traders are willing to pay a higher premium
to buy the right to sell the euro in coming months.
 CANADIAN DOLLAR RISES
 One of Friday's biggest movers was the Canadian dollar
, which earlier surged 1 percent against the greenback
on a stronger-than-expected improvement in jobless figures.
[nSCL9IE63J]
 The U.S. dollar was last trading 0.8 percent lower at
C$1.0341, its lowest since late June.
 The dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.1 percent to 83.744
following the Canadian numbers, but off from a two-month low. 
 Canada's figures mirror strong jobs data from Australia
earlier this week that drove the Australian dollar up more than
4 percent.
 Strong data has boosted hopes of a firmer economic recovery
and raised pressure on the low-yielding yen  as investors
cut long positions and shifted into high-beta currencies like
the Aussie  and New Zealand dollars .
 The euro touched a two-week high earlier of 112.69 yen
 on EBS after jumping more than 1 percent on Thursday
but pared those gains to trade last at 111.68 yen.
 The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 88.56 yen . It has
moved away from a seven-month low of 86.96 yen struck on July
1.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2010 07:48AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Not too stressed," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - Potentially robust second-quarter
corporate earnings and more clarity on the state of European
banks in the coming week should help calm investors stressed by
a possibility of a double-dip recession.
 World stocks, measured by MSCI, rose almost every day in the
past week to a two-week peak, erasing losses suffered in late
June after nervousness over European bank stress tests and
weakness in the U.S. economy fanned concerns that the world
might slip into recession again.
 However, sentiment improved in the week as early signs
pointed to solid corporate earnings in the United States.
Expectations also grew that the stress tests, whose results are
due on July 23, are not likely to damage the financial industry.
 This has prompted some investors to scale back their overly
pessimistic view, although they are not in a rush to buy risky
assets.
 ""In the past three weeks we've downgraded our view in order
to take into account the deteriorating state of the global
economy. But we're not in a camp to expect a disaster,"" said
Alain Bokobza, head of global asset allocation strategy at
Societe Generale.
 ""There's no risk of a double-dip. A double-dip is too risky
and that's not what policymakers want.""
 Half of Societe Generale's multi-asset portfolio is invested
in stocks -- down from 65 percent in March. Bonds and credit
make up a fifth of the portfolio, alternatives 15 percent and
the rest is in cash.
 Its proprietary economic newsflow data show all indicators
point to an expansion of the economy, although China is the only
country where newsflow is levelling off.
 It expects 4 percent global GDP growth this year, which
equals 20 percent earnings growth in 2010 and 2011.
 Double-dips are a very rare event, happening just once --
1981 -- in the past 90 years, according to Credit Suisse.
 Thomson Reuters data shows the average U.S. expansion lasts
38 months, which points that this leg of growth should have
between one and two more years to run.
 Next week's earnings include Alcoa, Intel, JP Morgan, Google
, Bank of America, GE and Citi.
 Thomson Reuters data shows earnings of S&P 500 firms are
expected to grow 27 percent in the second quarter from the
previous three months, after expanding at a rate of 58.3 percent
in the January-March period.
 So far, with 26 of 500 firms already reported, 69 percent of
earnings are coming above expectations.
 
 'BBB' RECOVERY
 However, despite all the signs that the world may avoid a
double-dip, investors are clealy not persuaded, seeking refuge
in safe cash.
 In the latest week, money market funds tracked by EPFR
recorded an inflow at a 78-week high of $33.5 billion, while
equity funds posted outflows of $11.25 billion.
 Morgan Stanley says this is because the nature of the
recovery is BBB (bumpy, below-par, brittle), as opposed to AAA
(ample, abundant and augmenting).
 ""As long as a recession doesn't materialise, markets may
well be delivering a policy-type stimulus by creating an easing
of financial conditions of the kind that central banks would
love to be able to recreate"", the bank said in a client note.
 ""In the near term... yields could stay low or move somewhat
lower, keeping financial conditions easy. A recovering economy
would find this helpful in further consolidating the BBB
recovery.""

 LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - The euro slipped off two-month
highs against the dollar on Friday with investors taking profits
ahead of the weekend as strategists said its recent rally would
peter out due to lingering worries about the euro zone economy.
 The single currency was supported in U.S. trade on Thursday
by strong German factory data, a positive U.S. jobs report and
more clarity on European bank stress tests, all of which boosted
demand for riskier assets such as shares.
 ""The euro rebound is now running out of steam. It is facing

exchange strategist at BNP Paribas, said.
 ""We expect it to come back under pressure. Continued concern
regarding the stress tests will weigh in the medium term...
Overall the picture for euro is negative."" 
 The euro erased gains to trade down 0.2 percent at $1.2667
at 0941 GMT, after reaching a 2 1/2-month high of $1.2723 on
trading platform EBS. 
 ""Euro/dollar was sold on profit-taking ahead of the
weekend,"" one London-based trader said.
 Options with a strike price of $1.2650 set to expire later

 BNP's Stannard said more demand for high-yielding commodity

 The euro could reach $1.2767 as the target off an A-B-C wave
sequence starting from the euro's four-year low at $1.1876, with
the C-wave starting at $1.2152. The $1.2780 area is a 50 percent
retracement of its fall from mid-April to the June low.
 ""The euro traded up primarily on global risk appetite...but
it is not doing an awful lot off its own fundamentals,"" Adam
Cole, global head of foreign exchange strategy at RBC Capital
Markets, said.
 ""There is still a risk that euro shorts get covered and the
bounce extends but it is no more than that: a short-term bounce.
There are plenty of hurdles for the euro zone to get over.""
 That view was reflected in the gap between 1-month risk
reversals, which have fallen nearly 55 basis points to 0.85/1.35
percent since end-June, and 1-year risk reversals, which have
shed 25 basis points.
 This indicates market players are willing to pay a higher
premium to buy the right to sell the euro down the line.

 YEN FALLS
 The euro touched a two-week high of 112.69 yen on EBS after

 * First monthly fall in producer prices since Nov 2008
 * Unexpected widening in trade gap as imports jump

(Adds detail)
 By Christina Fincher and David Milliken
 LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - Falling fuel costs helped to slow
British factory gate inflation more than expected last month but
a jump in imports in May caused a surprise widening in Britain's
trade gap.
 Producer output prices took their first monthly fall since
November 2008, welcome news for Bank of England policymakers
hoping consumer price inflation will fall back to target without
the need for higher interest rates.
 Producer prices dropped 0.3 percent on the month in June,
reducing the annual rate to 5.1 percent from May's downwardly
revised 5.5 percent, according to the Office for National
Statistics. Analysts had forecast a reading of 5.7 percent, only
slightly below April's 18-month high of 5.9 percent.
 ""There's a little bit of comfort here for policymakers
reflecting on the medium-term outlook,"" said Philip Shaw, an
economist at Investec.
 Input prices slipped for a second consecutive month after
falls in crude oil and imported metal prices more than offset
the biggest monthly jump in British farm produce costs since
June 2008. This monthly decline took the annual rate down to
10.7 percent from 11.5 percent in May.
 However, a rise in the annual core rate of output price
inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs,
prompted worries that spare production capacity was not bearing
down on inflation as much as the central bank had hoped.
 ""Although the input numbers are good, the core output
numbers are not doing any favours to the Bank of England,"" said
Brian Hilliard, UK economist at Societe Generale.

 TRADE GAP WIDENS
 Britain's goods trade deficit widened to 8.06 billion pounds
($12.22 billion) in May from 7.41 billion in April, surprising
economists who have waited in vain for an export-led recovery on
the back of a weaker currency.
 The pound has lost around a fifth of its value on a
trade-weighted index over the past three years, yet trade has
remained a drag on GDP.
 The deterioration in May was led by imports, which rose 2.4
percent on the month while exports were broadly flat.
 Taking trade in services into account, the total deficit
swelled to 3.817 billion pounds, its highest since July 2008,
from 3.502 billion.
 ""It's consistent with this theme of disappointment that
trade isn't making as big a contribution to growth as we had
hoped,"" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS.
 The outlook does not look bright, with the euro zone debt
crisis set to slow growth in the bloc, Britain's biggest trading
partner, thus sapping demand for UK exports.
 Although the pound remains competitive on any historical
comparison, it recently hit a 19-month high against the euro
and the export orders component of last month's manufacturing
purchasing managers' index fell sharply.

 By Emelia Sithole-Matarise
 LONDON, July 9 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday as
investors welcomed positive signals from the U.S. economy but
the euro retreated from two-month highs against the dollar as
its recent rally looked fragile on lingering doubts about the
euro zone recovery.
 European stocks tracked gains in Asia after first-time U.S.
jobless claims dropped to their lowest level in two months and a
handful of retailers reported solid sales.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares
<.FTEU3> was up 0.4 percent by 1045 GMT, adding to gains of 5
percent over the past three days.
 It was on track for its biggest weekly gain in a year, but
is still down 8.5 percent from a mid-April peak, on worries
about debt levels in Europe and the global economic recovery.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> added 0.3
percent, supported by the gains in Europe and Asia.
 ""After periods of declining equity markets, we now have a
bit of relief rally, but it's not something which I would expect

Investments.
 ""We still have a lot of political uncertainties. Will the
European Union be able to reform itself and will the governments
stick to the consolidation efforts? There is also a lot of
anxiety in the market regarding the strength of the economy.""
 Fears that recovery from the world's worst downturn in
decades could stall had triggered outflows of more than $11
billion from equity funds worldwide in the first week of July
and induced the biggest inflows in 18 months for safe haven
money market funds, fund tracker EPFR Global said.

 DIFFERENT WATERS NEXT WEEK
 ""The bounce in risk has been primarily led by short-covering
...There're still a lot of challenges. We'll move into different
waters next week when U.S. earnings are released and we start
getting forecasts for the four quarter,"" said Kenneth Broux,
financial markets analyst at Lloyds TSB in London.
 The euro slipped off two-month highs against the dollar as
investors booked profits before the weekend and strategists said
its recent rally would wane on lingering worries over the euro
zone's recovery.
 It was trading down about 0.2 percent on the day at $1.2674
 by 1118 GMT, after rising to a 2-1/2-month high of
$1.2723.
 Options with a strike price of $1.2650 set to expire later
on Friday were seen supporting the euro, traders said, after it
fell to the day's low of $1.2661.
The single currency got a lift late on Thursday following
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's comments that the euro area
economy performed much better in the second quarter although he
said it would still grow ""at a moderate and still uneven pace in
an environment of high uncertainty"".
 The rally in riskier assets such as equities eroded demand
for safe-haven government bonds, with German Bund prices
extending falls from the previous session. 
 The 10-year German Bund yield , which moves
inversely to price, was last up three basis points at 2.657
percent while the U.S. 10-year T-note yield  rose
one basis point to 3.050 percent.
Oil rose towards $76 a barrel, heading for its biggest
weekly gain since May, after falling U.S. inventories and the
positive economic data helped the pickup in risk appetite and
sentiment across markets.
 U.S. crude for August  rose 30 cents to $75.73 a

for heavy vehicles (above 6 tonnes), but will instead bring
stabilisation. We cannot expect to see a consistent recovery

 Incoming orders for trucks above 6 tonnes in Germany were,
however, up 80 percent in the first half thanks mainly to
overseas demand, albeit from the extremely depressed levels seen
in 2009 when the market plunged by half.
 Heavy truck exports also picked up, doubling in June alone
while recording an increase of 22 percent in the first half to
26,720 units.
 The VDA said Germany's heavy truck segment expanded in May
for the first time since September 2008, and new registrations
-- which lag sales slightly -- grew by 37 percent in June.
 ""We expect that the positive trend will continue in the
second half of the year, and therefore that the year 2010 as a

level seen in 2008, which almost reached the 100,000 mark,"" he
continued, adding that the domestic commercial van segment would
grow by 3 percent this year to 180,000 vehicles.
 Daimler is the world's largest truck maker, followed by

 * Slovakia faces pressure to back euro zone rescue fund
 * Ministers to seek progress on budget discipline deal
 
 By Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - European Union finance
ministers will try to agree the fine points of bank stress tests
when they meet next week and break a deadlock in talks on new
financial supervisors, EU diplomats and officials said.
 Meeting on Monday and Tuesday, they will also press Slovakia
to stop balking at signing an accord needed to launch a 440
billion euro ($554 billion) support mechanism for euro zone
countries in financial trouble.
 The euro zone's 16 finance ministers, whose meeting will be
followed by the gathering of all 27 European Union finance
chiefs, will also try to push on with negotiations over stricter
budget discipline rules so they can take effect next year.
 ""Stress tests will be a major point in the discussions. It
will be a follow-up to the presentation of CEBS,"" said an EU
source, referring to the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors, which on Wednesday published broad guidelines on
how the bank health check-ups will be carried out.
 CEBS' statement lacked some important details, for example
the scale of write-downs for banks holding sovereign debt deemed
not entirely secure. It will be the last full finance ministers'
meeting before the stress test results are published on July 23.
 ""The ministers will also discuss policy responses by
countries where stress tests show pockets of vulnerability, if
this is indeed the case,"" the source said.
 Countries should in general have sufficient national funds
to recapitalise weaker banks, but some may want to turn to
special EU rescue funds set up this year to help governments
withstand the turbulence in sovereign debt markets.
 ""Turning to those funds would require strict conditionality
and negotiations with the European Commission,"" the source said.
 The funds include a 60 billion euro facility guaranteed by
the EU budget, which is operational, and the 440 billion euro
mechanism, which will be ready when all 16 euro zone countries
sign a relevant framework agreement.
 Euro zone newcomer Slovakia's government, formed after an
election last month, has doubts over signing the agreement and
the country's Finance Minister Ivan Miklos will face pressure
from his 15 euro zone partners to approve it.
 ""We expect Slovakia to make an announcement that will allow
us to make the vehicle operational,"" the source said.
 Miklos has told Reuters that all options are open.
 
 FINACIAL SUPERVISION, BUDGET DISCIPLINE
 In what is shaping up to be a pivotal meeting, EU ministers
will also seek ways to break the deadlock in negotiations with
the European Parliament on a sweeping reform of financial
supervision so the assembly can approve it in September.
 Creating EU supervisors to keep tabs on banks, insurance
companies and financial markets is key to the bloc's efforts to
prevent new crises. Delays have been embarrassing as Washington
accelerates its own financial rule changes. 
 Negotiations broke down this week as lawmakers sought more
powers for pan-EU bodies than was palatable for some
governments, especially Britain.
 ""The idea is to give a wider mandate for the Belgian

source said. Belgium has the EU presidency until Dec. 31, 2010.
 The ministers will also discuss recent proposals from the
EU's executive arm to use the hard lessons of the debt crisis to
sharpen budget discipline in the 27-nation bloc.
 The plan includes new sanctions for countries which breach
the EU's budget deficit cap of 3 percent of economic output and
those which persistently fail to cut high public debt.
 Under the proposal, EU countries would submit general budget
outlines to the Commission and finance ministers for the
following year. The Commission and the ministers would assess
the plans and issue guidelines for the country to follow.
 The Commission hopes for a quick agreement on the plan so it
can propose legislation in September.
 Finally, the minister are expected to rubber-stamp new rules
that would put a cap on cash bonuses to bankers.

media
 * Poll result could stall Kan's push to fix public finances
 * JGB yields could rise on faltering fiscal reform hopes
(Adds PM Kan, paragraphs 10-11)
 By Yoko Kubota and Linda Sieg
 TOKYO, July 9 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto
Kan's Democratic Party looks increasingly likely to suffer a
sharp setback in a weekend election, surveys showed on Friday,
putting his job at risk and hampering efforts to curb a huge
public debt.
 Flagging support for the Democrats, who swept to power last
year promising change, had jumped after Kan -- Japan's fifth
leader in three years -- replaced his indecisive predecessor
last month.
 But ratings slipped after Kan floated the typically taboo
topic of raising the sales tax and seemingly failed to persuade
voters he had a clear plan for fixing Japan's economic woes.
 ""Kan has failed to get voters' minds off what a mess the
DPJ has made of being in power,"" said Columbia University
professor Gerry Curtis. ""They won't be able to get anything
done. It will be political manoeuvring for months to come.""
 The DPJ, which ousted its long-dominant rival last year
with promises to cut waste and focus spending on consumers,
will almost certainly run the government however many seats it
wins on Sunday, because it controls the powerful lower house.
 The party needs a majority in the upper chamber to avoid
policy deadlock and begin taking steps to reduce a public debt
already about twice the size of the nearly $5 trillion economy,
the worst among advanced countries.
 Surveys by the Nikkei, Yomiuri and Asahi newspapers showed
the DPJ would likely win around 50 or even fewer of the 121
seats up for grabs in the 242-member chamber -- well short of
Kan's target, and a drop from its current 54 seats.
 That would deprive the DPJ and its tiny coalition partner,
the pro-spending People's New Party, of a majority in the upper
house. The Democrats would be forced to seek new allies,
hampering the government's ability to forge ahead with the
fiscal reform that Kan has put at the heart of his campaign.
 The DPJ's current coalition partner opposes raising the 5
percent sales tax any time soon, as do some potential allies.
Other opposition parties agree a rise is inevitable but would
probably be reluctant to help out the rival DPJ, which has not
yet mapped out any detailed tax reform proposals.
 PM VULNERABLE TO CHALLENGE
 Kan, who has said that any sales tax hike would take at
least two to three years to implement, told reporters there may
be misunderstanding among voters that the tax would rise right
away.
 ""I made a proposal to start non-partisan debate on not just
the sales tax but on other taxes too so we can avoid default,
but voters may have read too much into it,"" he was quoted by
Kyodo news agency as saying while campaigning in northern
Japan.
 A showing of fewer than 50 seats would leave Kan vulnerable
to a challenge from powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa -- a critic of his
sales tax proposal -- ahead of a September party leadership
vote.
 ""If they go below 50, the mass media and Ozawa will make a
fuss,"" said independent analyst Hirotaka Futatsuki.
 But few expect Kan, a 63-year-old former grassroots
activist, to quit without a fight, and Kyodo news agency quoted
Democratic Party Secretary-General Yukio Edano as saying the
premier would stay on regardless of the poll outcome.
 The Japanese government bond market had rallied last week
in part on fiscal reform hopes. The rally has since fizzled on
expectations the DPJ could fall well short of its election
goal, although many expect that debate on a possible sales tax
rise will persist now that Kan has raised the long taboo topic.
 If the ruling party fails to reach its target, yields would
likely rise, said Shinji Nomura, chief fixed-income strategist
at Nikko Cordial Securities.
 The Asahi newspaper said the DPJ could win fewer than 50
seats, but gave a range of 42 to 57, reflecting close races in
many districts and a hefty chunk of voters still undecided.
 ""I had a lot of hopes for Kan, but the way he brought up
the sales tax idea was really bad,"" said Toshimitsu Kinjo, 54,
who works at small publishing firm and has yet to make up his
mind.
 ""As they keep saying in the media, there are other things
that should be done first,"" added Kinjo, who said he had voted
for the DPJ last year but was now undecided. ""Kan is a more
practical politician than Hatoyama and I thought he could run
the government well, but then he came up with the sales tax
talk.""
 Political parties have also struggled to grab voter
interest in Japan's second national election in less than a
year, with a betting scandal hitting the national sport of
sumo, the World Cup soccer tournament and even heavy rain
competing for attention.
 Media surveys showed that both the small pro-reform Your
Party and New Komeito, which partnered with the Liberal
Democratic Party until its ouster last year, could win around
10 seats, making them attractive potential allies.
 The leaders of both parties have ruled out an alliance with
the DPJ, but analysts say they might change their tune later.
 The upper house can block bills other than treaties and
budgets and the current coalition lacks the two-thirds lower
house majority that would let it override the upper chamber.
 In the latest sign that the Democrats were struggling, the
Nikkei survey showed their lead over the opposition LDP had
shrunk, with 32 percent of respondents planning to vote for the
DPJ -- down three points -- against 22 percent for the LDP and
11 percent for the Your Party.
 Voter support for Kan's government also fell 5 points to 45
percent in the Nikkei poll, a 23-point drop from his initial
rating after taking office last month.

 By Kim Yeon-hee and Yoo Choonsik
 SEOUL, July 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea raised interest
rates on Friday for the first time since the outbreak of the
financial crisis and cemented market expectations of more
tightening by predicting solid growth and higher inflation
ahead.
 The central bank lifted its base rate by 25 basis points
from a record low of 2.0 percent, joining regional peers from
Australia, to India, Taiwan and Malaysia in the campaign to
return policy to pre-crisis mode.
 Investors have been pricing in a rate rise for several
weeks given signs of authorities' growing confidence that
Asia's fourth-largest economy can sustain its recovery, despite
lingering doubts about the outlook for U.S. and European
economies.
However, most analysts polled by Reuters had expected a move
either in August or September and bond futures fell sharply
right after the decision, though later recovered much of the
losses.
 The won extended gains to more than 1 percent on the day
against the dollar. Stock prices were little changed.
 ""It appears that policymakers across Asia are reasonably
confident about the economic outlook despite concerns about the
potential impact of euro area weakness and a near-term dip in
growth from the fast pace set earlier this year,"" said Brian
Jackson, senior emerging markets strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in Hong Kong.
 ""We forecast the Bank of Korea to hike rates another 50
basis points by the end of the year, with risks increasingly
skewed to the upside.""
 Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong-soo told reporters the
economy probably expanded by more than 7 percent from a year
earlier in the second quarter and the whole of the first half,
another sign of solid recovery from the global slump.
 He also said annual inflation was set to exceed the 3
percent mid-point of the central bank's 2-4 percent target
range next year, which markets took as a hint the central bank
would bring rates closer to 3 percent by the end of the year.
 He also noted a sharp rise in mortgage lending in June
after a period of subdued growth.
 ""There's no doubt that the base rate of 2 percent was very
low when taking into account various factors such
as economic growth and inflation prospects."" Kim said.
 Kim voiced optimism that the global economy would continue
to grow, but singled out Europe's fiscal problems as the main
risk and said more financial market turbulence was possible.
 This, combined with assurances that even after this week's
rate rise monetary policy would remain accommodative, suggested
that any further tightening would be cautious.
 ""As the base rate is still very low and the pace of
tightening is very gradual, it is supportive for the economy
and the impact on the market won't be negative,"" said Lee
Sung-kwon, economist at Shinhan Investment Corporation.
 Since mid-April, world financial markets have been dogged
by concerns about the impact of Europe's austerity drive on
global growth and fears that recovery from the worst economic
downturn in decades may stall and lead to a double-dip
recession.
 This week's move was the first rate rise since August 2008
and the first rate change since early last year when the
central bank finished its easing campaign that shaved off a
total of 325 basis points of its benchmark rate.

 HONG KONG, July 9 (Reuters) - Asian stocks climbed for a
second day and the euro held near two-month highs on Friday,
boosted by positive U.S. data and the European Central Bank's
cautiously upbeat view of the euro zone's recovery.
 The Japanese yen was under pressure as investors cut long
positions and shifted towards high-yielding currencies such as
the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar.
 European shares are expected to open higher with futures on
STOXX Europe 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 up 0.6 to
0.9 percent. U.S. data showed on Thursday first-time jobless
claims dropped to their lowest level in two months and some
large retailers reported solid sales.
 In Asia, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside
Japan rose 1.3 percent, on track for its biggest weekly gain in
a year, with the consumer durables and energy sectors
outperforming. The index is still down more than 6 percent this
year.

 Interest rate increases by the South Korean and Malaysian
central banks have underlined the growing confidence about
Asia's recovery after the International Monetary Fund said a
double-dip world recession was unlikely.
 Fears that recovery from the world's worst downturn in
decades could stall had triggered outflows of more than $11
billion from equity funds worldwide in the first week of July
and induced the biggest inflows in 18 months for safe haven
money market funds, fund tracker EPFR Global said.
 Bank of Korea's quarter point rate rise on Friday, its

follows Thursday's hike by Malaysia's central bank, cementing

 But there are several hurdles to the market sustaining its
gains with many analysts worried about higher financing costs,
lower earnings and tighter liquidity.
 ""At the end of the day you are looking at a market which is
at fair value, faced with tight liquiduity and rising cost of
capital and earnings downgrades,"" said Emil Wolter, head of
regional strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 ""It seems more likely we will become cheap than expensive
from here.""
 HSBC analysts said in a research note that Asian stocks
outside Japan were trading at forward price-earnings multiples
above those in Russia and Brazil
 Around the region, Taiwan's main TAIEX share index recorded
its biggest weekly gain in 10 months while the Korea Composite
Stock Price Index finished just 2 percent shy of its 2010 peak.
 Taiwan's stocks have been outperforming the region in
recent sessions on hopes of sustained growth in earnings after
China and Taiwan signed a landmark trade agreement in late
June.
 China's battered stock markets, plagued by liquidity
problems due to a flood of issuances, pulled further from
15-month lows struck last week.
 The Shanghai Composite index is on course for its biggest

 The market focus has now switched to upcoming data with
hopes China's GDP report next week could allay fears of a sharp
slowdown.
 Among the region's top performers, Hong Kong's consumer
goods exporter Li & Fung rose 6.4 percent after the company
said it signed three acquisition deals expected to bring in

percent after a newspaper reported it was close to inking a

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Equity funds worldwide
suffered more than $11 billion of net outflows in the first
week of July, while money market funds saw the biggest inflows
in 18 months amid fears of a double-dip recession, EPFR Global
said on Friday.
 Money market funds, an equivalent of cash for many
investors, had inflows of $33.5 billion, while equity funds saw
$11.25 billion move out of the door, fund tracker EPFR said in
a statement.
 Bond funds in aggregate absorbed another $3.64 billion for
the week ended July 7 and global emerging markets equity funds
took in $517 million.
 Investors have become increasingly concerned about
faltering economic growth after a rash of weaker than expected
data. Last week, a report showed U.S. employers cut far more
jobs than expected in June and the unemployment rate hit 9.5
percent -- the highest in nearly 26 years.
 Double dip is a term that refers to a recession followed by
a short-lived recovery. The World Bank said in June that a
double-dip recession could not be ruled out in some countries
if investors lose faith in efforts in Europe and elsewhere to
tackle rising debt levels. [ID:nSGE659004]
 ""Worse than expected U.S. labor and housing market data and
fear of what stress tests of major European banks will reveal
continued to weigh on sentiment towards the major developed
market and the funds that invest in them during the first week
of July,"" EPFR said.
 EMERGING MARKET EQUITIES
 Investors regained some confidence in the fund group in the
latest week, sending fresh money to Asia.
 Global emerging market equity funds saw $517 million in
inflows and Asia ex-Japan equity funds absorbed $124 million.
 Europe, Middle East & Africa funds and Latin America
focused funds had outflows, suggesting willingness to take
risks is still tentative.
 Latin America posted its 13th consecutive week of outflows,
driven by fears of a knock-on effect if the U.S. economy slows
significantly.
 DEVELOPED MARKET EQUITIES
 Funds investing in the United States, the European Union's
biggest export market had a rough week, with overall
redemptions from U.S. Equity Funds exceeding $10 billion for
only the second time this year.
 Japan equity funds also posted outflows, their seventh in
the past nine weeks, as a dip in domestic capital spending,
questions about the effect of the yen's appreciation on Japan's
exports and uncertainty about economic policy made investors
cautious.
 SECTOR FUNDS
 The lure of gold and precious metals as a hedge against
uncertainty helped commodity funds top the list of EPFR
Global-tracked sector funds once again in early July, with
investors committing $419 million to this fund group, taking
year-to-date inflows past the $11 billion mark.
 The consumer goods sector funds were the second biggest
absorbers of fresh money, pulling in $226 million.
 FIXED INCOME FUNDS:
 Emerging market bond funds continued to soak up fresh
money, despite waves of risk aversion.
 In the latest week, the fund group saw $740 million in
inflows.
 Investors pulled $113 million out of high yield bond funds.
U.S. bond funds attracted over $2.3 billion for the week, with
funds investing in short-term and municipal debt posting the
biggest inflows.
 Global bond funds took in a net $631 million as brisk
demand for recent European sovereign issues alleviated concerns
about their generally heavy exposure to this region.

 * High-yielders hold gains on improving risk appetite
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 9 (Reuters) - The euro held near two-month highs
on Friday, while the yen was under pressure as investors cut long
positions and veered towards high-yielding currencies on
improving risk appetite.
 The euro was little changed on the day at $1.2684, with near
term resistance around the May 12 high of $1.2740. It broke past
resistance at $1.2673 on Thursday when it advanced nearly 0.5
percent against the U.S. dollar and jumped over 1 percent against
the low-yielding yen.
 The euro was supported by a cautiously optimistic European
Central Bank, strong European industrial production data and a
sizeable drop in U.S. initial unemployment claims. For details,
see.
 Clarity on European bank stress tests also helped the euro,
as well as bank shares, as investors saw criteria for the checks
were no more onerous than markets expected.
 ""Market players are likely to cover more short euro
positions, with charts pointing the euro has hit a bottom against
the dollar and the yen,"" said Masahiro Kami, capital market
analyst at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
 ""At the same time, the euro's rebound may be limited as
investors are unlikely to buy back all euro positions they have
cut back.""
 Traders and strategists remained wary about going long on the
single currency in a big way, given the fiscal and debt problems
that hobble euro zone's economy. In fact, some expect
profit-taking and a sell-off soon.
 ""Even though the euro has had a bit of a renaissance, the
longevity of these gains is open to question, and is reflected in
a wide gap between the one-month and one-year risk reversals,""
David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital.
 ""Short-term bearishness has dissipated to some extent, but
longer-term markets are still prepared to pay a hefty premium for
puts over calls.""
 Indeed, while 1-month risk reversals have fallen nearly 55
basis points to quote at 0.85/1.35 percent since the end of last
month, 1-year risk reversals, have declined by about 25 basis
points in the same period.
 The European Central Bank on Thursday kept interest rates at
a record low 1.0 percent at its monthly meeting. ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the economic recovery in the euro area
continued in the first half of 2010, although he expected growth
to show an uneven pace in an environment of high uncertainty.
 He offered few details on whether the upcoming stress tests
will effectively gauge the health of European banks. Details on
the tests will be disclosed later this month..
 The euro stood at 112.30 yen, hovering near a two-week of
112.52 hit on Thursday, when it jumped more than 1 percent
against the Japanese currency.
 The yen was under pressure as investors cut long positions
and shifted funds towards high-beta currencies like the
Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar.
 The dollar inched up 0.2 percent at 88.55 yen, having gained
0.8 percent on Thursday. It has managed to pull away from a
seven-month low of 86.94 yen struck on July 1.
 Japanese importer demand lifted the dollar against the yen in
early trade, traders said.
 The yen had made solid gains against the greenback earlier
this month on the back of growing worries about an economic
slowdown in the United States and falling stock markets.
 But those worries seem to have taken a backseat with some of
the gloom lifting due to expectations of strong earnings in the
U.S. and thus boosting risk appetite.
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.2 percent to $0.8752 on
profit-taking, off a two-week high of $0.8792 hit on Thursday.
But momentum towards the Aussie was strong given a solid jobs
reading which brought back the risk of near term rate increases.
 The Australian dollar was steady on the day at 77.46 yen,
having surged nearly 5 percent this week.
 The Obama administration declined to label China a currency
manipulator in a report on Thursday, spurring fresh calls from
U.S. lawmakers for tough new steps to pressure Beijing.
 Traders said Washington's decision had little impact on
foreign exchange rates as investors saw the yuan's weakness was
no longer an internationally hot issue after China last month
freed its yuan from a nearly two-year-old peg to the dollar.

 By Kim Yeon-hee and Yoo Choonsik
 SEOUL, July 9 (Reuters) - The Bank of Korea raised interest
rates on Friday for the first time since the outbreak of the
financial crisis, saying inflation was likely to pick up while
the economy was set to sustain solid growth.
 The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee raised the
7-day repurchase agreement rate by 25 basis points to 2.25
percent from a record low of 2.0 percent, surprising analysts,
most of whom had expected a rise in August or September.
 The central bank gave no clear indication about future
policy moves in its brief statement, but analysts expected more
gradual tightening in months ahead.
 ""There is still uncertainty over the euro zone crisis, but
the central bank's decision is based on the view that the
current interest rates are too low,"" said Lee Sung-kwon,
economist at Shinhan Investment Corporation.
 ""We expect them to raise rates again in the fourth quarter
and push them to the 3 percent level by the first half of next
year.""
 Bond futures fell and the won extended gains while stocks
were little changed after the rate move, which came slightly
sooner than expected.
 The central bank singled out Europe's fiscal problems and
the euro zone's austerity drive as the main threat to growth,
but analysts saw Friday's move as a sign of confidence that
South Korea's economy was now firmly on a growth track.
 ""The decision indicates that the authorities are confident

 * Euro firm at $1.27, resistance eyed at $1.2740
 * Gap widens between 1-mth and 1-yr risk reversals
 * High-yielders hold gains on improving risk appetite
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, July 9 (Reuters) - The euro held near two-month highs
on Friday, while the Japanese yen was under pressure as investors
cut long positions and veered towards high-yielding currencies on
improving risk appetite.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was firm at $1.2698, with
near term resistance around the May 12 high of $1.2739. It broke
past resistance at $1.2673 on Thursday when it advanced nearly
0.5 percent against the U.S. dollar and jumped over 1 percent
against the low-yielding yen .
 The euro was supported by a cautiously optimistic European
Central Bank [ID:nLDE6670DA], strong European industrial
production data and a sizable drop in U.S. initial unemployment
claims. For details, see [ID:nN08209499].
 Despite this week's gains, traders and strategists remained
wary about going long on the single currency in a big way, given
the fiscal and debt problems that hobble euro zone's economy. In
fact, some expect profit-taking and a sell-off soon.
 ""Even though the euro has had a bit of a renaissance, the
longevity of these gains is open to question, and is reflected in
a wide gap between the one-month and one-year risk reversals,""
David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital.
 ""Short-term bearishness has dissipated to some extent, but
longer-term markets are still prepared to pay a hefty premium for
puts over calls.""
 Indeed, while 1-month risk reversals  have
fallen nearly 55 basis points to quote at 0.85/1.35 percent since
the end of last month, 1-year risk reversals , have
declined by about 25 basis points in the same period.
 The European Central Bank on Thursday kept interest rates at
a record low 1.0 percent at its monthly meeting. ECB President
Jean-Claude Trichet said the economic recovery in the euro area
continued in the first half of 2010, although he expected growth
to show an uneven pace in an environment of high uncertainty.
 He offered few details on whether the upcoming stress tests
will effectively gauge the health of European banks. Details on
the tests will be disclosed later this month. [ID:nECBNEWS].
 The euro was firm  near a two-week high against the
yen, at 112.27 yen, having jumped more than 1 percent in the
previous session.
 The yen  was broadly under pressure as investors cut
long positions and shifted funds towards high-beta currencies
like the Australian dollar  and the New Zealand dollar
.
 The dollar was firm on the yen at 88.40 yen, having gained
0.8 percent on Thursday. It has managed to pull away from a
seven-month low of 86.94 yen struck on July 1.
 The yen had made solid gains against the greenback earlier
this month on the back of growing worries about an economic
slowdown in the United States and falling stock markets <.SPX>.
 But those worries seem to have taken a backseat with some of
the gloom lifting due to expectations of strong earnings in the
U.S. and thus boosting risk appetite.
 The Australian dollar was firm around $0.8772 and just below
a two-week high of $0.8792 in offshore trade. Momentum towards
the Aussie was strong given a strong domestic jobs reading which
brought back the risk of near term rate increases.
 The New Zealand dollar  was around $0.7090, just
below a high of $0.7103, its best since June 28.

 By Doug Palmer and Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON, July 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department
again declined to label China a currency manipulator in a
long-delayed report issued late on Thursday that is likely to
provoke Congressional calls for tougher methods with Beijing.
 Some U.S. lawmakers have claimed that a misalignment in
China's yuan currency distorts trade and steals jobs.
 The Treasury's semiannual currency report, which originally
was due on April 15, said China's yuan remains undervalued but
noted Beijing had made a ""significant"" move last month by
ending a peg between the value of the yuan, also called the
renminbi, and the dollar.
 ""What matters is how far and how fast the renminbi
appreciates,"" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a
statement issued with the report.
 ""We will closely and regularly monitor the appreciation of
the renmimbi and will continue to work towards expanded U.S.
export opportunities in China,"" he said.
 One week before a meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Canada
last month, Beijing freed its currency from a nearly
two-year-old peg to the dollar and has let it rise slightly in
value since.
 U.S. legislators have proposed revamping U.S. trade and
currency legislation to make it easier to take punitive actions
against countries that have ""fundamentally misaligned""
currencies that effectively give them an unfair price advantage
over American-made products.
 The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and
Means Committee, Sander Levin, said the United States should
keep ""all options"" open to pressure China on its currency,
following the release of the report.
 ""We must monitor China's progress, but also give serious
consideration to all options in the event -- as was the case in
2005-2008-- that China fails to take the additional necessary
steps representing steady and significant progress,"" Levin
said.
 He said ""Congress and the Administration should fully
explore the option of challenging China's current practices
through a WTO complaint.""

U.S. jobs data that also helped European shares to 10-day highs

 EURO GAINS
 Europe named 91 banks taking part in a health test of its
banking system on Wednesday -- including many regional banks
where markets suspect most of the sore spots reside -- as it
seeks to restore confidence in the sector.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
appropriate action would be taken where needed on bank balance
sheets. He spoke after the ECB bank left interest rates on hold
at a record low 1.0 percent.
 Trichet said the global economy and foreign trade may
recover more strongly than projected, further supporting euro
zone exports. The area's economy, however, is expected to grow
""at a moderate and still uneven pace in an environment of high
uncertainty,"" he said.
 The euro rose 0.49 percent to $1.2696 , extending a
strong run after hitting a four-year low of $1.1876 in early
June. The greenback gained 0.70 percent at 88.31 .
 The Australian dollar gained about 1.5 percent on the day
against the U.S. dollar to $0.8770 .
 The U.S. Treasury said China's yuan is undervalued, but
refrained from saying Beijing was manipulating its currency
despite pressure to do so from U.S. manufacturers hurt by cheap
imports from China. [ID:nNLL8IE68Q]
 The International Monetary Fund raised its U.S. growth
forecast slightly to 3.3 percent for 2010 and 2.9 percent for
2011, but said unemployment would remain above 9 percent for
both years and inflation would remain low.
 The IMF also sees the greenback depreciating moderately
over the next five years, saying it is ""somewhat"" overvalued
and greater currency flexibility in some countries will be
needed to support the global economy.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 13/32 of a point in
price, pushing the yield to 3.04 percent .
 ""It's a low, low-yielding world,"" said Richard Gordon,
fixed-income strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte,
North Carolina. ""Slow growth is being priced in and there's no
inflationary pressure right now.""
 The German government two-year bond yield  rose
5.2 basis points to 0.734 percent, having at one point raced up
to 0.745 percent, its highest level since the end of April.

crude oil settled up 1.85 percent, at $75.44 a barrel .

 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro touched a two-month
high against the dollar on Thursday as U.S. and Australian
economic data restored faith in the global economic recovery
and boosted investors' appetite for higher-yielding
currencies.
 New claims for U.S. unemployment insurance fell more than
expected last week and several top U.S. retail chains reported
June same-store sales that topped estimates, supporting demand
for stocks and other higher-risk assets.
 A jump in Australian employment in June drove the

 The Australian dollar and other so-called commodity
currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, as well as the euro

assets.
 The euro climbed as high as $1.2700, its highest level
since mid-May, according to Reuters data. It was last up 0.4
percent at $1.2691, still within striking distance of the
session high.

 The Australian dollar was 2.1 percent higher versus the yen

June, well above forecasts for 17,500. It rose 1.3 percent on
the day against the dollar to $0.8756.
 The yen was one of the day's biggest losers as gains in

rose 1.2 percent against the Japanese currency to 112.14.
 Sterling slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5158, pulling away from

 EURO GAINS
 Europe named 91 banks taking part in a test into the health
of its banking system on Wednesday -- including many regional
banks where markets suspect most of the sore spots reside -- as
it seeks to restore confidence in the sector.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said
appropriate action would be taken where needed on bank balance
sheets. He spoke after the ECB bank left interest rates on hold
at a record low 1.0 percent.
 Trichet said the global economy and foreign trade may
recover more strongly than projected, further supporting euro
zone exports. The area's economy, however, is expected to grow
""at a moderate and still uneven pace in an environment of high
uncertainty,"" he said.
 The euro rose 0.19 percent to $1.2658 , extending a

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
against the dollar on Thursday as U.S. and Australian economic
data restored faith in the global economic recovery and boosted
appetite for higher yielding currencies.
 New claims for U.S. unemployment insurance fell more than
expected last week and several top U.S. retail chains reported
stronger June same-store sales, supporting demand for stocks
and other higher-risk assets. and
 A jump in Australian employment in June drove the
Australian dollar up more than 1 percent on the day against the
dollar and nearly 2 percent higher against the yen.
 Clarity on European bank stress tests helped financial
stocks as investors saw criteria for the checks were no worse

added.
 The Australian dollar and other so-called commodity
currencies, such as the Canadian dollar as well as the euro,
are often seen as a gauge for investors' demand for riskier
assets.
 The euro climbed to as high as $1.2700, its highest since
mid-May, according to Reuters data. It was last up 0.3 percent
at $1.2669.
 The European Central Bank earlier kept interest rates at a
record low 1.0 percent at its monthly meeting.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said at a press

 Trichet offered few details on whether the upcoming stress

president reiterated his calls for full transparency of the
results and said complete disclosure would boost confidence
among investors.
 Details on the test will be disclosed later this month.
 Further declines in the U.S. dollar are likely, according
to the International Monetary Fund. The greenback will
depreciate in value ""moderately"" over the next five years, the
Fund predicted on Thursday.
 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR RALLIES
 The Australian dollar was 2.6 percent higher versus the yen
at 76.75 yen, on the back of data showing Australia created
45,900 jobs in June, much higher than forecasts for 17,500. It
rose around 1 percent on the day against the dollar to
$0.8731.
 The yen was one of the day's biggest losers as gains in
European and U.S. stocks prompted investors to shed long

 The dollar rose 0.9 percent to 88.53 yen, while the euro
rose 1.3 percent against the Japanese currency to 112.32.

 * Integration to be completed in December
 * Boskalis shares up 0.7 percent
 
 AMSTERDAM, July 8 (Reuters) - Koninklijke Boskalis
Westminster NV, the world's largest dredger, said it expected
the integration of Dutch peer Smit to be completed in December
2010, as it announced the resignation of Smit's head.
 Earlier this year, Boskalis acquired Smit Internationale,
one of the world's largest marine salvage firms, following a
1.15 billion euro offer for the group, excluding 250 million
euros in debt.
 In a statement on Thursday, Boskalis said that the
integration progress with Smit was progressing well and that the
latter's chief executive, Ben Vree, would resign from the board
of management of Boskalis effective Jan.1 1, 2011.
 ""I am staying on to complete the integration of this
wonderful company,"" Vree said in a statement.
 Boskalis shares were up 0.8 percent to 33.01 euros at 1439
GMT, underperforming Amsterdam's bluechip index, which was up
1.7 percent.
 The merger with Smit has allowed Boskalis to enhance its
portfolio and win more contracts by tapping into the salvage,
harbour towage and transport and heavy lift capabilities of its
Dutch peer, creating a maritime services giant. 
 But overcapacity has emerged as a major issue in the
dredging industry, which is yet to reap the benefits of economic
recovery. Earlier this year Boskalis said it was scrapping 16
vessels as it tried to fine-tune capacity.
 From Jan 1, 2011, the management board of Boskalis will
consist of Chief Executive Peter Berdowski, Chief Financial
Officer Hans Kamps and Theo Baartmans, the statement said.

 * Deal could create largest bilateral free-trade area
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, July 8 (Reuters) - The European Union's trade
chief talked up the benefits of a possible deal with Latin
America's Mercosur region on Thursday, facing down strong
opposition from environmentalists, farmers and lawmakers.
 Addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Karel De
Gucht said a free-trade agreement with Mercosur, which groups
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, would boost EU exports
of goods and services and open new public works contracts.
 The European Union and Mercosur held nearly five years of
talks between 1999 and 2004 over establishing a free-trade zone,
but failed to reach an agreement partly because of differences
over agriculture. Talks are expected to resume in July.
 If an agreement can be reached -- and it could take years to
negotiate -- it would create the world's largest bilateral
free-trade zone, encompassing 750 million people and goods
valued at 65 billion euros ($82 billion) a year.
 ""The Commission is well aware of the sensitivity of
agriculture in these negotiations and will take this element
into account when negotiating,"" De Gucht told lawmakers,
referring to the EU executive, which will lead the talks.
 De Gucht said there were good early signs that Mercosur
would open its markets to European exporters in the ""goods,
public procurement and services"" sectors, and said a deal would
boost exports of EU-produced wine, cheese, fruit and vegetables.
 That was an attempt to answer concerns among European
farmers -- a very powerful lobby in the EU -- and their many
supporters in parliament that a free-trade deal would hurt EU
agriculture, particularly meat and poultry producers.
 Beef, pork and poultry products from Mercosur would only be
allowed to enter the EU if they complied with stringent legal
standards and health and safety checks, De Gucht said.
 ""Let it be very clear there is no intention to negotiate
away our health and safety requirements,"" he said.
 
 ""FARMERS THREATENED""
 Farmers and environmentalists remain unconvinced, and many
members of the European Parliament, which has gained extra
powers since the passage of the EU's Lisbon treaty last December
and is keen to exercise them, oppose the deal.
 ""EU farmers and the food sector see it as a disaster for
them,"" said Mairead McGuinness, an Irish member of parliament
from the centre-right EPP, the largest bloc in parliament.
 ""There are huge environmental consequences if the deal
allows an expansion of beef production in the Mercosur region.
 ""The United States and Japan will not contemplate a trade
deal with Mercosur that sacrifices its agriculture sector. It is
hard to understand why the EU is prepared to do a deal.""
 EU trade negotiators are conscious that a deal with Mercosur
would give the 27-nation bloc an edge over the United States,
whose attempts to tap Latin America's growing consumer market
via a free trade deal have so far been frustrated.
 A Mercosur pact would likely benefit agri-food giants with
Latin American operations such as Cargill Inc. and Tyson Foods
Inc., while hurting small farmers and the environment, Green
party lawmaker and activist Jose Bove said.

 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
against the dollar on Thursday amid a broad increase in risk
appetite after strong Australian data and a
larger-than-expected drop in U.S. weekly initial jobless

 A jump in Australian employment in June drove the

dollar and nearly 2 percent higher against the yen.
 The Australian dollar and other so-called commodity

 * Improving global demand and weak euro boost trade, output
 * Imports from euro zone outstrip exports to the bloc
 
 By Sarah Marsh
 BERLIN, July 8 (Reuters) - German trade surged in May while
industrial output jumped more than expected, fuelling hopes
Europe's largest economy may have posted its strongest growth in
over two years in the second quarter.
 Analysts said disruptions to air travel in April caused by
an ash cloud sent up by Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull had
led to a rebound in trade in May, when imports rose at their
fastest monthly rate since German reunification in 1990.
 A jump in manufacturing output meanwhile drove industrial
production up 2.6 percent on the month, well above a consensus
forecast for a 0.9 percent gain, and analysts said the outlook
was bright over the coming months due to strong orders.
 ""The latest figures confirm that the German recovery gained
momentum in the second quarter,"" said Capital Economics analyst
Ben May. ""(They) add to evidence that any negative effects on
the sectors from the euro zone fiscal crisis are being more than
offset by the global economic upturn and weaker euro for now.""
 Germany emerged from its deepest post-war recession in the
second quarter of 2009. The recovery has picked up over the past
few months and Thursday's data helped dispel lingering doubts
about growth in the light of the euro zone debt crisis and
ensuing austerity measures.
 Imports rose month-on-month by 14.8 percent in seasonally
adjusted terms to 70.3 billion euros ($88.55 billion), the
largest jump on record in modern Germany, Bundesbank data
showed.
 Exports climbed 9.2 percent from April to 80.8 billion
euros, narrowing the trade surplus to 10.6 billion euros.
 ""The demand is very strong for German goods, especially from
developing nations like China,"" said Juergen Michels, an
economist for Citigroup in London. ""The German economy will
likely have expanded by 1 percent in the second quarter.""
 That would be the strongest growth in more than two years.
 In the January-March period, gross domestic product (GDP)
grew 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter.
 
 INDUSTRIAL BACKBONE
 Data this week showed German manufacturing orders fell on
the month for the first time this year in May, but analysts said
this was mostly a technical correction and the economy remained
firmly on the path to recovery.
 ""While German consumer confidence probably took a hit
yesterday evening and a World championship title is out of
reach, the German economy is still a promising candidate in
another race: the one of euro zone growth champion 2010,"" said
Carsten Brzeski at ING Financial Markets.
 The International Monetary Fund upgraded its 2010 global
growth forecast on Thursday, citing robust expansion in Asia and
renewed U.S. private demand.
 Other data showed that British industrial output rose faster
than expected in May, taking its annual rate of growth to its
highest in almost 10 years.
 Alexander Koch, an analyst at Unicredit, said the recent
turnaround in forward-looking sentiment indicators worldwide
suggested a deceleration in German output later this year.
 ""But the strong order inflow in the preceding months as well
as the lower but still clearly expansionary business activity
readings argue against an abrupt end to the upswing,"" he added.
 The latest trade figures suggested the German recovery was
having a knock-on effect for trading partners within the euro
zone, some of which have criticised Germany for tailoring its
economy too strongly towards exports.
 Imports to Germany from the rest of the euro zone were up by
nearly a third from the previous year and far outstripped the
gain in exports to the other 15 nations using the euro.

 By Svetlana Kovalyova
 MILAN, July 8 (Reuters) - Biodiesel output in Italy,
Europe's third-biggest producer, may plunge 60-70 percent this
year after falling 50 percent in the first six months of 2010
hit by cheap imports, a top industry official said on Thursday.
 ""We have a strong fall in production in the first half of
this year, of about 50 percent, because of rapidly growing
imports,"" said Maria Rosaria Di Somma, director general of the
industry body Assocostieri-Unione Produttori Biocarburanti.
 ""The situation is alarming and, unfortunately, our full-year
forecasts are for a bigger (output) fall, of up to 60-70
percent, if the government does not take measures against
illegal imports,"" Di Somma told Reuters in a telephone
interview.
 The European Commission, which oversees trade policy for the
27-nation bloc, imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties for
up to five years on imported U.S biodiesel in May 2009. But
European industry has said such duties have being by-passed.
 Italian biodiesel makers, who use mostly imported raw
materials including palm oil and rapeseed oil, are unable to
compete with imported fuel which costs less than their raw
materials. Several plants have suspended production, Di Somma
said, declining to name those plants.
 She did not say where the cheap imports were coming from but
previously she has said that such imports came from the United
States and Argentina.
 Italy's 2.5 million tonne biodiesel capacity was heavily
underused in 2009, with just 694,000 tonnes produced there, up
from 670,449 tonnes in 2008. Imports surged to 465,000 tonnes
from 239,887 tonnes in 2008, according to Assocostieri data.
 Biodiesel imports are on the rise this year, flooding the
Italian market, and Assocostieri has appealed to the government
to introduce measures against illegal imports in a new
competition legislation being drafted at present, Di Somma said.
 Earlier this year, Italian customs seized 10,000 tonnes of
biodiesel of uncertain origin which could have been imported
illegally.
 
 BLENDING TARGETS
 Biodiesel imports would take a lion's share of Italy's
obligatory blending target for biofuels in total car fuel use
this year. The target is set to be covered mostly by biodiesel,
which is favoured by Italian car fuel producers, Di Somma said.
 As a result, Italy's bioethanol output is almost totally
sold abroad, she said.
 Italy has only two bioethanol producers with a total
capacity of 215,000 tonnes, according to Assocostieri's data.
 Italy should boost output of both biodiesel and bioethanol,
with a focus on development of second-generation technologies,
to be able to meet the European Union's targets which oblige
member states to raise the share of renewable energy sources in
transport to 10 percent by 2020, Di Somma said.
 Italian industry and science have made important steps in
research into use of algae as biofuel but it would take several
years to find an economical way to start industrial production,
she said.
 Italy has raised the obligatory share of biofuels in the car
fuel mix to 3.5 percent in 2010 from 3.0 percent in 2009. The
target will be raised to 4.0 percent next year and to 4.5
percent in 2012 to catch up with the EU goals.

 * Policy reform should avoid radical redistribution of funds

 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, July 8 (Reuters) - Farm spending should continue
to take the largest share of the European Union's budget up to
2020, EU lawmakers voted on Thursday in a signal of their
opposition to a radical reform of EU farm policy from 2013.
 The common agricultural policy (CAP) currently consumes
about 40 percent of the bloc's 120 billion euro ($151.2 billion)
annual budget, and is a prime target for those wishing to shift
EU spending to new priorities such as energy and innovation.
 ""Since the CAP will have to confront many challenges and
pursue broader objectives after 2013, it is essential that the
budget ... is at least maintained at current levels,"" the
European Parliament said in a non-legislative resolution adopted
by a large majority.
 The vote allied parliament with EU states such as France and
Germany, who want to maintain current CAP spending levels after
2013, but pitted it against Britain and some within the EU's
executive, who argue the money would be better spent elsewhere.
 Ahead of Thursday's vote, the lawmaker leading the
parliamentary debate -- Scottish liberal George Lyon -- said
many EU states ""including the big two"" had lobbied members
directly to urge them to support the resolution.
 ""I think that's an important signal to the (European)
Commission about where the consensus lies in this,"" Lyon told
Reuters.
 Despite the emerging consensus among lawmakers and key EU
states, who will have a joint say in the CAP reform process,
Lyon predicted on Wednesday that farm spending would not escape
the sweeping cuts being made to public spending across Europe.
 The Commission is due to put forward legislative proposals
on reform of the CAP by next June, around the same time as it is
expected to propose the shape and size of the EU's overall
budget for 2014-2020.
 EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said after the
vote that parliament's resolution would ""provide useful input
into our deliberations"" on the reform proposals.
 
 NO RADICAL REDISTRIBUTION
 The parliament said the CAP's current two-pillar structure
should be maintained, with direct payments to farmers under the
first pillar complemented by extra subsidies under the second,
which is designed to promote rural development measures.
 The lower level of direct aid paid to farmers in EU states
that joined the bloc since 2004 must also be addressed in the
reform, the parliament said.
 But the lawmakers stopped short of calling for ""equal""
distribution, and said instead that it should be ""fair"", and
added that the reform should ""avoid too radical a redistribution
of support"".
 By 2020, all member states should allocate direct payments
to farmers on a per-hectare basis, lawmakers said, although
countries may retain a limited link between subsidies and
production levels for vulnerable areas and sectors.
 Market management tools such as storage intervention should
be kept after 2013 as a ""safety net"" against price volatility
and market crises, the resolution said.
 But export refunds should continue to be phased out in line
with the EU's international trade commitments, the parliament
added.

 By Lin Noueihed
 LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
against the dollar on Thursday after strong Australian jobs data
boosted higher-risk currencies, while investors awaited European
Central Bank comments on bank stress tests and money markets.
 A jump in Australian employment in June drove the Australian
dollar up more than 1 percent on the day against the dollar and
nearly 2 percent higher against the yen.
 The European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates
at a record low 1.0 percent when it announces its policy
decision at 1145 GMT. Markets will focus on comments by ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet on whether stress tests on
European banks will be tough enough to convince markets of their
worth. 
 Investors will also watch for clues to whether the ECB is
happy with a recent rise in money market rates or may seek to
increase liquidity, possibly via tenders with longer maturities.
 ""The euro is on a reasonably good uptrend. If Trichet sounds
a bit more optimistic today on money markets and bank stress
tests we will see that uptrend continue,"" Daragh Maher, deputy
head of foreign exchange research at Credit Agricole, said.
 ""Markets seem comfortable we will get reasonably testing
assumptions in the tests but Trichet will avoid addressing the
issue directly. He will say wait for the results."" 
 Trichet is due to hold a news conference at 1230 GMT.
 The single currency climbed as high as $1.2688 in Asian
trade, its highest since mid-May, before trimming gains. It was
trading 0.2 percent up at $1.2659 at 0907 GMT and some market
participants said options set to expire later in the day at
$1.2650 and $1.2655 may chain the euro near current levels.
 The euro has rallied on short-covering in the past month,
after hitting a four-year low of $1.1876 in early June.
 Analysts said resistance at its May 21 high of $1.2673 was
proving hard to break cleanly and further resistance at
$1.2767-80 was seen as difficult to overcome on this run higher.
 The $1.2767-80 band is where downtrend resistance emerges
as a line connecting the December 2009 and April 14 highs. It is
also a 50 percent retracement of the euro's decline from a
mid-April high to the June low.
 The yen was one of the day's biggest losers in what some
said was a largely technical rebound in riskier trades, while
the euro's gains quickly ran into profit-taking.
 Sterling hit a two-month high versus the dollar of $1.5241
as easing concerns about euro zone banks and global recovery
boosted risk demand. 
 It later erased those gains and was trading down 0.22
percent at $1.5149 at 0908 GMT, with market players citing Asian
central bank selling behind the downward move.
 Markets awaited the Bank of England's monetary policy
decision at 1100 GMT, though most economists expect the bank to
leave interest rates at 0.5 percent.
 
 AUSSIE UP, YEN HIT
 The Aussie was 1.7 percent higher versus the yen at 77.09
yen, after hitting 77.23 yen, its highest in more than a week,
on the back of data showing Australia created 45,900 jobs in
June, much higher than forecasts for 17,500.
 The Aussie rose 1.0 percent on the day against the dollar to
$0.8732, touching its highest in almost two weeks at $0.8748 and
pushing above its 55-day moving average at $0.8664.
 The low-yielding yen has benefited recently as investor
confidence took a knock, but it fell sharply against the euro,
dollar and kiwi on Thursday. A 0.7 percent rise in European
shares underpinned improved risk demand.
 Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar hit a
fresh two-month low of 83.707 before recovering to 83.90.

 By Gleb Stolyarov and John Bowker
 MOSCOW, July 8 (Reuters) - Russian car sales soared 45
percent year-on-year in June as a state scrappage scheme and
wider economic recovery boosted the formerly troubled industry.
 The Association of European Businesses (AEB) said on
Thursday 174,838 cars were sold in Russia last month, compared
with 120,752 in June 2009. The AEB earlier told reporters
preliminary data showed a 46 percent rise. 
 Sales accelerated from a 31 percent jump in May, and
contrast sharply with steep declines a year ago, when
unemployment fears and a lack of consumer credit conspired to
put off car-buyers and push the industry close to collapse.
 ""The government support packages are continuing to have an
impact on the lower segments but growth is now apparent across
all segments in the market. Increasing availability of finance
is also a key driver,"" said AEB Autos Committee Chairman David
Thomas in a statement.
 
 HIGHER DEMAND
 Russia launched its transformational car scrappage programme
in March and drivers have been flocking to the showrooms ever
since, but the economic recovery is also playing a part.
 ""The rise probably would have been lower without different
state programmes, but demand would still be there. Producers are
reporting higher demand than they can satisfy,"" analyst Vladimir
Bespalov at brokerage VTB said.
 Russia's ""cash for clunkers"" scheme -- recently extended
with a 10.5 billion rouble ($339 million) cash injection --
awards drivers 50,000 roubles for trading in cars at least 10
years old for new, locally produced models.
 The scheme has particularly helped Russia's AvtoVAZ -- 25
percent owned by Renault -- which has seen sales of its Lada
models outstrip the market after flirting with bankruptcy last
year.
 Lada sales surged 77 percent in June from a year ago, and
are up 23 percent for the six months to end-June. Overall
first-half sales are up just 3 percent, after taking into
account big falls in January and February.
 Russia has also helped local suppliers by slapping an import
duty on cars, a scheme that business daily Vedomosti said on
Thursday would be extended until at least 2012.

 BEIJING, July 8 (Reuters) - The People's Bank of China will
maintain an appropriately loose monetary stance but will use its
various policy tools flexibly, the central bank said on Thursday.
 The PBOC was disclosing the main conclusions of the
second-quarter meeting of its monetary policy committee, a body
that advises on policy but does not decide it.
 ""In the second half of this year...we will continue to
implement an appropriately loose monetary policy to maintain
policy consistency and stability,"" according to a statement
released on the central bank's website, www.pbc.gov.cn.
 The PBOC, echoing its statement of June 19 when it ended the
yuan's 23-month-old peg to the dollar, said it would improve the
currency's exchange rate mechanism and adjust its value with
reference to a basket of foreign currencies.
 The statement did not contain the bank's standard line that
it will ""keep the yuan's exchange rate basically stable"" but
broke no new ground on currency policy.
 The yuan  has gained 0.76 percent since it was
unshackled.
 China's foreign exchange regulator said earlier on Thursday
that expectations of yuan appreciation had weakened and Beijing
would keep the exchange rate stable. [ID:nTOE66703Y]
 The central bank said the Chinese economy was heading in the
expected direction with coordinated growth in consumer spending,
investment and exports.
 China releases economic indicators for June and the second
quarter next Thursday, with a poll by Reuters pointing to a
moderation of growth. [ID:nTOE66602P]
 Concerns over an abrupt slowdown has been weighing on
domestic stock prices and global commodities in recent weeks.
 The central bank made it clear that it did not support a
blanket credit tightening.
 ""We will use various monetary policy tools flexibly and keep
appropriate growth in money supply and credit,"" the PBOC said.

 LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-month high
against the dollar on Thursday after strong Australian jobs data

 A surprise jump in Australian employment in June pushed the

 Investors will also watch for clues on whether the ECB is
happy with the rise in money market rates or may seek to raise
liquidity supply, possibly via tenders with longer maturities.
 The euro would gain on ECB signals that it is not concerned

 The single currency climbed as high as $1.2688 in Asian

 * China net buying hits Y694.8 bln, peak on data since 2005
 * Move underscores yen's appeal in times of market stress
 * May reflects temporary demand rather than long-term shift
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - China bought a record $7.9 billion
in short-term Japanese debt in May, a surge widely viewed as
temporary while sovereign debt concerns buffet the euro, rather
than a shift in China's long-term investment stance.
 But some analysts said the purchases may also be a sign of
foreign reserves diversification into the yen and away from the
euro and the dollar by China.
 ""As a result of the latest crisis, it is possible that they
may be thinking of diversifying a bit more rather than just
sticking with the euro and the dollar,"" said Satoru Ogasawara, an
economist for Credit Suisse Securities Japan.
 In May, Chinese investors bought a net 694.8 billion yen in
short-term Japanese debt -- a record high on data going back to
January 2005, Japanese Finance Ministry data shows.
 Coupled with net buying of 40.4 billion yen in medium- to
long-term Japanese bonds in May, net buying of Japanese bonds out
of China in January to May totalled 1.28 trillion yen, already
exceeding an annual record of 255.7 billion yen logged in 2005.
 ""They are probably increasing their investment in the yen
somewhat. I think it probably includes, to a significant degree,
moves to seek temporary refuge,"" said Akira Hoshino, chief
manager for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange
trading department.
 ""One issue is whether this is leading to a full-fledged
change in asset allocation. But if that were the case, I think
there would be some buying in the longer end,"" Hoshino said.
 Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the numbers.
 The purchases of short-term Japanese debt were small compared
to the size of China's foreign reserves -- $2.4 trillion and
investors in China were not the only ones that piled into
short-term Japanese notes in May.
 Total net buying of short-term Japanese debt by overseas
investors hit a record 4.4 trillion yen in May led by buying by
UK investors, who bought a net 5.5 trillion yen, the data showed.
 Hoshino at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ also said it was
unclear just how much impact such buying of short-term Japanese
debt has had on the yen, adding that some of the buying, in
theory, could have been conducted while hedging against currency
risk.
 The Chinese buying of Japanese debt comes at a time when
analysts say China has been shifting some of its foreign exchange
reserves -- the world's largest stockpile -- into a wider range
of currencies in recent months, including assets elsewhere in
Asia and in commodity-producing countries.
 Roughly a quarter is estimated to be held in euro-denominated
assets, primarily sovereign bonds, analysts say.
 ""There is a lot of money in various parts of the world with
nowhere to go, and there are probably some moves to choose the
yen in times like these,"" said Taisuke Tanaka, foreign exchange
strategist for Nomura Securities.
 ""Such moves are unlikely to be limited to China,"" he said.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Thursday
while the euro hit a two-month peak against the low-yielding
dollar on rising expectations the forthcoming earnings season
would show strong corporate performance.
 Wall Street posted its best one-day gain in about six weeks
on Wednesday after financial company State Street  said
quarterly earnings would far exceed expectations, providing a
lifeline to investors after several weeks of dismal economic
reports.
 ""Positive comments from State Street ... cheered investors
up on the basis that we've got the second-quarter reporting
season coming up and perhaps the bank situation in terms of
reporting might not be as bad as feared,"" said Richard Hunter,
head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown.
The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.7 percent
to a 1-1/2 week high. The Thomson Reuters global stock index
<.TRXFLDGLPU> also rose 0.7 percent.
 According to Thomson Reuters data, quarterly earnings of S&P

quarter after surging 58.3 percent in the first quarter.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> gained nearly 1 percent,
led by Danish shipping and oil conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk
, which rallied 6 percent after the company upgraded
its earnings guidance for the full year.
 Expectations that stress tests for European banks will not
be as stringent as feared also supported the sector, together
with some upbeat broker comment.

 ECONOMIC OPTIMISM
 Oil prices [O/R] jumped to a one-week high above $75 a
barrel on an industry report showing U.S. crude inventories
plunged last week, stock market gains and hopes global economic
recovery is still intact.
 ""The fear over a double-dip recession or something more
dramatic has eased a little bit from a month ago,"" said Yingxi
Yu, Singapore-based commodities analyst with Barclays Capital.
 ""Market sentiment remains a very important driver. Oil
really follows equity markets and other risky assets.""
 The bund futures  rebounded from an earlier two-week
low to gain 10 ticks.
 Improving risk appetite pushed the euro to a two-month high
of $1.2687 , extending its strong run after hitting a
four-year low of $1.1876 in early June.
 The next focus for the market is the European Central Bank,
which holds a news conference at 1230 GMT after its monthly

 It is expected to face pressure to say whether Europe-wide
stress tests on banks will be tough enough to convince markets

 (Adds details, background)
 By Dave Graham
 BERLIN, July 8 (Reuters) - German trade with the rest of the
world surged in May, partly due to companies seeking to make up
for transport delays the month before but still fuelling hopes
for a strong second quarter performance by Europe's largest
economy.
 Analysts said disruptions to air travel in April caused by
an ash cloud sent up by Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull had
led to a rebound in May, when imports rose at their fastest rate
since German reunification in 1990.
 The data on Thursday from Federal Statistics Office also
showed imports to Germany from the rest of the euro zone were up
by nearly a third from the previous year.
 Month-on-month, imports rose by 14.8 percent in seasonally
adjusted terms to 70.3 billion euros ($88.5 billion), the
largest jump on record, Bundesbank data showed.
 Exports climbed by 9.2 percent from April to 80.8 billion
euros, leading to a decrease in Germany's trade surplus to 10.6
billion euros from a revised 12.8 billion euros in April. A
Reuters poll had shown forecasts centred on a surplus of 13.5
billion euros.
 ""The demand is very strong for German goods, especially from
developing nations like China,"" said Juergen Michels, an
economist for Citigroup in London. ""The weaker euro is starting
to have an effect as well. The German economy will likely have
expanded by 1 percent in the second quarter,"" he said.
 In the January-March period, gross domestic product (GDP) in
Germany grew 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter.
 ""A reason for (the latest trade data) could be the catch-up
effect from the ash cloud in April that brought air transport to
a virtual standstill for a while. A lot of that was compensated
for in May,"" Michels added.
 Germany emerged from its deepest post-war recession in the
second quarter of 2009. The recovery has picked up over the past
few months yet doubts linger, particularly given the euro zone
debt crisis.
 
 EURO ZONE IMPORTS STRONG
 A key survey last Thursday showed that the manufacturing
sector expanded for a ninth month running in June, growing at
the same pace as in May despite signs austerity measures abroad
may be slowing demand..
 However, industrial orders unexpectedly fell slightly in May
due to a dip in big ticket items, data showed on Wednesday.
 The latest trade figures also helped to shrink Germany's
unadjusted current account surplus to 2.2 billion euros.
 Andreas Rees, an economist at UniCredit in Munich, said that
though the surge in imports would dampen the positive
contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) from net trade,
there could be a silver lining.
 ""We suspect that the increase in imports was largely driven
by more demand for intermediate goods. This in turn would signal
that the underlying momentum in the industrial sector is still
strong,"" Rees said.
 Germany has come under fire from trading partners in the
euro zone for tailoring its economy too strongly towards
exports. However, the latest data show the increase in its
imports from the rest of the euro zone far outstripped the gain
in exports to the other 15 nations using the euro. 
 Its exports within the bloc rose by 21.4 percent on the year
in May, with imports up 32.8 percent.

 * China Says dollar's strength limits yuan's scope for rise
 * Comments are reiteration of long-standing currency policy
 BEIJING, July 8 (Reuters) - China made clear again on
Thursday that it has every intention of keeping its currency on
a short leash with conditions not ripe, in its view, for the
large appreciation sought by the United Sates.
 The Chinese foreign exchange regulator said expectations
that the yuan would strengthen had been subsiding, as evidenced
by an easing in the inflows of speculative cash betting on a
rise in the currency.
 ""We will apply dynamic management and adjustments to the
floating range of the renminbi's exchange rate, maintaining its
basic stability at a reasonable and balanced level, pushing
forward a basic balance of international payments,"" it said.
The yuan is also called the renminbi.
 SAFE's statement was not a new policy declaration but
rather the fourth in a series of question-and-answer statements
about the nature of its operations.
 It has been trying to fend off domestic critics who are
dissatisfied with its management of China's $2.5 trillion in
foreign exchange reserves, while also offering the world a peek
behind its veil.
 The regulator also noted that inflows of foreign capital
had diminished recently. The level in April had been the
highest since before the credit crunch rocked global markets in
2008, but net foreign exchange purchases in the Chinese bank
market in May dropped 56 percent on a month-on-month basis, it
said.
 Global investors had fled to the dollar as a safe-haven
play in volatile markets, denting the appeal of the yuan, SAFE
said.
 ""The U.S. dollar index at one point climbed to its highest
level since March 2009, and expectations for yuan appreciation
in onshore and offshore markets have dropped significantly,"" it
said.
 The Chinese currency has risen 0.75 percent against the
dollar since the central bank abolished a two-year yuan peg in
mid-June.
 SAFE made no reference to de-pegging or the long period
during the global financial crisis when the currency was locked
in place, suggesting that it viewed policy as largely unchanged
since Beijing first allowed the yuan to begin rising in 2005.

 U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has begun to
express frustrations at the slow pace of appreciation. Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke said this week that the yuan must rise
more despite the resumption of minor adjustments and Obama
called for a level playing field for U.S. and Chinese firms in
trade relations.
 SAFE did not comment on the foreign calls for a stronger
yuan. China has consistently said that outside pressure will
hinder reform of its exchange rate.

them
 * Move to monitor volatile fx flows, raise tax collection
 * Analysts say enforcement may be a problem
 By Gde Anugrah Arka
 JAKARTA, July 8 (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to issue new
rules this year that will require companies to report where and
in which banks they expect to put their export earnings, as it
seeks to monitor capital flows and improve tax collection.
 The government sees export earnings as a more stable source
of foreign exchange than short-term speculative inflows, which
have sent the stock market <.JKSE>, bond prices and the rupiah
currency  soaring in the past year.
 Indonesia worries hot money could threaten financial
stability, and the plan follows measures by its central bank
last month aimed at channeling strong capital inflows away from
short-term investments. [ID:nJAK210755] [ID:nTOE65T062].
 ""This is aimed at helping track foreign exchange flows,
espcially those related to exports,"" said Evi Suhartantyo, a
spokesman at the finance ministry's customs and excise office.
 ""Our aim in requiring them to fill in the names of banks in
the export documents is related to payments of export duties.""
 The move comes as the government takes on resources firms
such as Singapore-listed palm oil producer Wilmar  and
Indonesiam coal producer Bumi Resources  over alleged
unpaid taxes, with improving tax collection a priority for the
country's finance minister.
 ""We expect to make the revised documents available (to
firms) in December,"" Susiwijono Moegiarso, a director at the
customs office, told Reuters.
 Exports from firms such as planter PT Astra Agro Lestari
Tbk , tin miner PT Timah  and
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc  have been driving
Southeast Asia's largest economy in recent years amid a boom in
commodity prices.
 But tax collection is very low, with the tax-to-GDP ratio
at around 11 percent, versus about 30 percent in some European
countries such as Belgium, according to World Bank data, and
Western governments have also been cracking down on tax
evasion.
 Economist Eric Alexander Sugandi at Standard Chartered said
the amount of unreported export earnings may reach billions of
dollars annually given that there are numerous seaports in the
sprawling country that are not easy to monitor.
 The International Monetary Fund said last month the
government needs to raise more tax to put its finances on a
more stable footing and to improve inadequate infrastructure,
steps that could help it obtain an investment-grade sovereign
credit rating.
 But in a country where graft is rampant, making the law
stick against the power of vested interests may be a challenge.
 ""How are the authorities going to monitor whether the
information given by exporters is correct? Exporters may open
their major bank accounts offshore and have only minor accounts
onshore, as they may be worried about having to pay higher tax
for putting most of their funds onshore,"" said Juniman, chief
economist at Bank Internasional Indonesia.
 ""There are a lot of good regulations in Indonesia, the
issue is more to do with the weak enforcement.""
 Some Indonesian politicians and economists have long
suggested authorities force firms to park export earnings at
home for a certain period of time, especially if the local
currency is under selling pressure.
 Wealthy Indonesians are a key source of clients for private
banks in neighbouring Singapore such as UBS .
 ""If the exports are financed by offshore banks, then the
procceds will more likely to be put abroad,"" said Hassan
Widjaja, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee
Exporters.

540,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2010 10:56PM ET</span>",China snatches up short-term yen notes in May," TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - China bought a net $8.4 billion of
Japanese bonds, mostly short-term notes, in May, when the euro
slid on heightened concerns over the euro zone's debt crisis,
Japanese Finance Ministry data showed on Thursday.
 China's net buying of Japanese bonds in May alone exceeded
the $6.2 billion of net purchases it logged in the first four
months of 2010.
 China bought a net 694.8 billion yen in short-term yen notes
and 40.4 billion yen in medium- to long-term Japanese bonds in
May, MOF data shows, bringing their total net buying of Japanese
bonds between January to May of this year to 1.28 trillion yen.
 Market players say such purchases do not represent a shift in
China's long-term investment stance but are more a short-term
move to park funds in yen while sovereign debt concerns buffet
the euro.
 Analysts say China has been shifting some of its $2.4
trillion in foreign exchange reserves -- the world's largest
stockpile -- into a wider range of currencies in recent months,
including assets elsewhere in Asia and in commodity-producing
countries.
 Roughly a quarter is estimated to be held in euro-denominated

 TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro surged to a two-month

weeks on Thursday after a bullish company forecast fuelled
optimism about the coming U.S. earnings season and underpinned
a slow return by investors to riskier assets.
 Further good news came with the release of Australian

to boost household incomes and spending and pushing the

 U.S. financial company State Street Corp  said on
Wednesday that quarterly earnings would far exceed
expectations, providing a lifeline to investors after several
weeks of dismal economic reports and propelling Wall Street to
its biggest one-day gain in six weeks.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan

 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average <.N225> rose 2.8 percent
to 9,535.74 points to mark its best one-day rise in over a
month, with exporters especially strong performers.
 But market watchers were wary about whether the gains would
last, noting that the Nikkei was finding it difficult to extend
its rise much past 9,500.
 Recent attempts at rallies in many markets have quickly
succumbed to profit-taking, highlighting weak investor
confidence and concerns that the global economic recovery may
be losing momentum.
 Strong company earnings reports and sales forecasts in
coming weeks could soothe some of those fears.
 ""There are probably a lot of individual investors who have
been waiting for a day like today to lock in profits,"" said
Hiroaki Osakabe, a fund manager at Chibagin Asset Management.
 ""The 9,500 level turned into resistance several times
during June, so this could be one good level (for selling).""
 But others thought the rally might have further to go, and
even Osakabe acknowledged that more short-covering could emerge
after the Nikkei was pushed to a seven-month low on Tuesday.

market in equities and risk appetite, and most people will see
it in that light,"" said Greg Gibbs, a currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland in Sydney.

 June Australian employment figures, released mid-morning,

an interest rate hike in the next few months and eroding
arguments for a possible cut.
 AUSSIE SHINES ON JOBS DATA
 The data sent the Aussie dollar up more than half a U.S.
cent and more than half a yen to its strongest levels since
late June, and helped the euro breach resistance at $1.2673,
although it quickly faltered at the highs.
 ""The Aussie numbers came in monster. You couldn't fault any

breaking above resistance at $1.2673 that had been seen as a
hurdle to further gains, but later fell back to around $1.2658.
 Most analysts in a Reuters poll believe it will stay weak

zone struggles to reduce debt levels.

the euro would fall to $1.24 in one month and $1.20 in three
months, then to $1.18 in six months and in mid-2011.

 TOKYO, July 8 (Reuters) - The euro pushed to a two-month high
against the dollar on Thursday as short-covering kicked in after
strong Australian jobs data sent the Aussie dollar up and helped
gains in other currencies against the greenback and yen.
 Australian employment surged past all expectations, rising
45,900 against forecasts for 17,500, and the unemployment rate
eased, reviving talk of a rate hike in the next few months and
eroding arguments for a possible cut.

 ""Unsurprisingly the Aussie is up, with bill futures also

 Australian consumer prices data is due on July 28.
 The Aussie rose 1.1 percent on the day to $0.8726, touching
its highest in almost two weeks at $0.8748 and pushing above its
55-day moving average at $0.8664.
 It climbed 1.7 percent on the yen to 77.09 yen, touching
77.23 yen, also a high of almost two weeks.
 The low-yielding yen, which has benefited recently as
investor confidence has taken a knock, also fell against the
euro, dollar and kiwi.
 An upbeat day on Wall Street on Thursday after a bullish
forecast from financial firm State Street Corp had already
underpinned improved tolerance for risk and boosted the higher
yielders.
 On trader said however much of the trading after the
Australian data appeared to be by interbank and proprietary
traders rather than client activity.
 The euro has had a strong run higher since hitting a
four-year low of $1.1876 in early June, driven largely by
short-covering.
 It rose 0.2 percent on the day to $1.2665, after climbing as
far as 1.2688.
 Analysts say it could have a bit further to go, but
resistance at its May 21 high of $1.2673 was proving difficult to
break cleanly and further resistance at $1.2767-80 was seen as
difficult to overcome on this run higher.
 That $1.2767-80 band is where downtrend resistance comes in
as a line connecting the December 2009 and April 14 highs. It is
also a 50 percent retracement of the euro's decline from a
mid-April high and the June low.
 Longer term, most analysts in a Reuters poll believe it will
stay weak against the dollar over the coming year. The survey of
about 60 analysts, taken July 2-7, predicted the euro would fall
to $1.24 in one month and $1.20 in three months, then to $1.18 in
six months and in mid-2011.
 The European Central Bank holds a news conference later after
its monthly meeting, and will face pressure to say whether
Europe-wide stress tests on banks will be tough enough to
convince markets of their worth.
 The dollar, which has come under pressure in the past week on
concerns about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery, fell
to a three-month low on the Swiss franc at 1.0481 francs.
 On an index which measures its strength against six major
currencies it slipped to a fresh two-month low of 83.707.
 It gained ground on the yen to 88.42 yen, up 0.8 percent on
the day and edging further off a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit
at the start of the month.

 Investors also scooped up industrials and technology stocks
that have been beaten down recently, while higher crude prices
boosted stocks in the energy sector.
 ""The reason why yesterday's rally fizzled was because we

 * Charts suggest possible rise in euro to $1.28 near term
(Updates prices, adds details)
 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro rose to a seven-week
high against the dollar on Wednesday in technical trading after
the breach of a key resistance level prompted some investors
who had bet against the single currency to buy to prevent
losses.
 Concerns about the growth outlook for the global economy
and plans to test the financial health of European banks had
weighed on the euro for most of the session.
 European regulators on Wednesday haggled over what details
to reveal from stress tests of about 100 banks, in a dispute
that could undermine confidence in the health checks on the
region's lenders.
 But the euro/dollar broke through technical resistance
around 1.2610, said Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT
Forex in New York.
 ""When it broke through that, it broke higher and from this
position there is no major resistance until 1.2676, the May
high,"" Lien said.
 Last week's data on euro/dollar short positions also
indicated there was only a small decline in euro short
positions, Lien said, which means there was still a lot of
opportunity for a short squeeze in the euro/dollar.
 Investors who bet against a currency are often forced to
turn around and buy to prevent losses if the currency actually
gains.
 The euro was last at $1.2636, up 0.1 percent on the day,
even after data showed factory orders in Germany, the euro
zone's largest economy, fell in May, marking the first decline
this year.
 The euro rose to $1.2665 on trading platform EBS on
Wednesday, its highest level in about seven weeks. The high
according to Reuters data was $1.2664.
 The euro gained support earlier this week after a solid
Spanish syndicated debt sale on Tuesday eased euro zone debt
fears and weak U.S. data hit the dollar.
 Analysts said the single currency could rise further in the
short term as a recent raft of weak U.S. data prompts investors
to unwind long dollar positions and short euro positions built
up since the start of the year.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday the euro
has stabilized and should be on a stronger foundation than
before the Greek crisis thanks to debt-reduction measures being
implemented in the euro zone.
 Still, most analysts in a Reuters poll believe the euro
will stay weak against the dollar over the coming year. The
survey of about 60 analysts, taken July 2-7, predicted the euro
would fall to $1.24 in one month and $1.20 in three months,
then to $1.18 in six months and in mid-2011.
 ""The euro remains vulnerable to another downturn as
investors begin to look to the 16-member bloc's growth
prospects amid a backdrop of strict budget cuts and the
potential for another downturn in the global economy,"" said
Omer Esiner, a chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington, D.C.
 The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 87.74 yen in late New York
trading, close to the session high of 87.77 but still not far
from a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit on EBS last week.

 By Louise Egan
 OTTAWA, July 7 (Reuters) - Euphoria in Canada over the
country's breakneck recovery has given way to a sinking
realization that it was too good to last, with a faltering U.S.
economy now seen dragging on growth.
 Two straight quarters of sizzling growth rates astounded
even the most bullish economists and prompted the Bank of
Canada to start raising interest rates in June from emergency
low levels. The feeling was that strength in the domestic
housing market and healthy consumer spending were enough to
offset headwinds from abroad.
 But a recent string of weak U.S. data has raised doubts
about the global economy's ability to stand on its own feet
without the help of government stimulus. For Canadians, it
serves as a blunt reminder that their fate is tied to that of
their neighbor, buyer of three-quarters of their exports.
 Data out on Tuesday showed U.S. service sector growth in
June was the slowest since February. This follow a report on
Friday that showed overall U.S. employment fell last month for
the first time this year. [ID:nN06102990]
 Companies that thrive on sales to the American consumer say
it's starting to feel like a recession all over again.
 ""Since early April I've been hearing ... that they're once
again seeing their customers delaying payment, having
difficulties financing their orders, and postponing orders.
Those were some of the signs that we saw in the latter part of
2007 and first half of 2008,"" said Jayson Myers, president of
Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, an industry group.
 The Bank of Montreal cited ""a potential double-dipping,
deflation-prodding U.S. downturn"" as one reason Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney will have to cut his growth forecasts
later this month.
 In a report this week, BMO tweaked its outlook to allow for
more pauses in the rate-hiking cycle this year and next. It
sees second-quarter growth of 2.7 percent, annualized, versus
the central bank's 3.8 percent estimate.
 ""U.S. demand just really isn't as buoyant as we had hoped,
and that the Bank of Canada had hoped. That makes them think
twice about hiking as consistently as what markets were
thinking a couple of months ago,"" said BMO economist Benjamin
Reitzes.
 Just one month ago, even after Carney warned that further
tightening was not ""preordained"", markets were pricing in an 82
percent chance of another quarter-point rate hike on July 20
after the bank lifted its key rate to 0.5 percent on June 1.
 Following news the Canadian economy stalled in April, that
expectation -- as indicated by the yields on overnight index
swaps -- dipped to below 50 percent. It now stands at nearly 60
percent. 
 Even monetary hawks who thought the bank was too slow to
lift rates in the face of robust growth and rising inflation,
now say the foot-dragging may not have been such a bad thing.
 ""I wished they had started getting back to normal a little
bit earlier, so maybe this slowdown in the United States is
going to make it less urgent to do that so it may come out all
right in the end,"" said David Laidler, professor emeritus at
the University of Western Ontario.
 PANDA DIPLOMACY
 The challenge for Canada is to figure out how to keep
growing its export economy even if Americans buy fewer of its
products -- a cause that Carney frequently champions.
 If anyone doubted Ottawa's resolve to tap fast-growing
markets like China, they only had to look as far as their
televisions on Monday, where Governor General Michaelle Jean
was seen cuddling baby pandas on a visit to China in the hope
that Beijing would sent two of them to Canadian zoos.
 China often uses the gift of pandas as a diplomatic tool to
signal warming relations. But after President Hu Jintao met
Prime Minister Stephen Harper in Ottawa last month there were
signs Canada will get more than symbolism. Beijing eased import
restrictions on Canadian beef and said it wants to double
bilateral trade to $60 billion by 2015.
 Ottawa also touts free trade negotiations with the European
Union and others as pathways to a more resilient economy.
 It's not just official policy. Businesses are finding it a
sensible and profitable strategy too. ""There seems to me to be
a new openness to dealing in non-traditional markets. That's
the kind of thing that a crisis produces,"" said Peter Hall,
chief economist at the Canadian government's export agency.
 Still, breaking into non-U.S. markets does not happen
overnight and to further complicate things the economic
recoveries in Europe and even high-growth Asia are not looking
as certain as they once were.
 Just as Canadian companies are coming to terms with the
need to seek growth opportunities outside North American, there
are fewer places to turn to.
 ""As manufacturers have tried to diversify more and find new
customers, risk has also diversified,"" said Myers.
 ""The bet that emerging economies, and especially China and
India, will continue to grow at such strong growth rates ...
that's the assumption that's now being questioned.""

548,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2010 03:24PM ET</span>",CHRONOLOGY-Total moves into Canada's oil sands," July 7 (Reuters) - Total SA  agreed
on Wednesday to buy UTS Energy Corp  for C$1.5 billion
($1.42 billion) in cash, more than doubling an offer the small
Canadian company spurned 18 months ago as the French major
looks
to boost its holdings in the Alberta oil sands.
 Here's a look at how the company built its stake in the oil
sands, the largest crude reserve outside the Middle East.
 January, 2003 - Total takes a 43.5 percent stake in the
Surmont thermal oil sands project planned by ConocoPhillips
 after agreeing in 1999 to participate in the project's
testing phase.
 August, 2005 - Total makes a C$1.1 billion friendly bid to
acquire Deer Creek Energy Ltd, developer of the Joslyn project,
which has bitumen, or extra-heavy crude, reserves pegged at
more than 2 billion recoverable barrels of bitumen.
 To fend off a rival offer, Total eventually raises its
offer to C$1.6 billion.
 April 2008 - Total bids C$480 million to acquire troubled
Synenco Energy Inc, owner of the Northern Lights oil sands
project. Synenco shareholders balk at the price, and Total
raises the bid to C$541 million in July. The acquisition is
complete a month later.
 January 2009 - Total makes its first attempt at UTS with a
hostile offer valuing the small oil sands developer at C$617
million. UTS and its shareholders consider the bid
opportunistic since it comes when oil prices are at recent
lows.
 Total raises its original bid to of C$1.30 a share to
C$1.75 in April but UTS shareholders still refuse to back the
deal. Total lets the offer expire in April, 2009.
 April 2009 - Sinopec <600028.SS>, which holds 40 percent
stake in the mothballed Northern Lights development, acquires
10 percent more from Total, making the two companies equal
partners in the project.
 January 2010 - Total and ConocoPhillips decide to expand
the Surmont oil sand project, announcing plans to quadruple
output to 110,000 barrels per day by 2015, one of the first
expansions announced since the financial crisis began in late
2008.
 July 2010 - Total finally wins the backing of UTS for the
acquisition of the company. Total gets 20 percent of Suncor
Energy Inc's  planned Fort Hills oil sands mine while
UTS keeps some undeveloped properties to be spun off into a new
company.

 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied on
Wednesday, spurred by a brighter outlook for banks on both
sides of the Atlantic, while oil prices snapped a six-day slide
on expectations U.S. crude inventories will decline.
 A bullish earnings forecast by State Street Corp ,
the world's second-largest custodian bank, lifted U.S. and
European banking shares. Higher crude prices boosted stocks in
the energy sector. For details see: [ID:nN07140060]
 Shares of State Street jumped almost 10 percent after it
forecast second-quarter operating earnings that were sharply
above analysts' expectations. Banks rebounded from recent heavy
losses, driving the KBW bank index <.BKX> up 2.5 percent.
 ""Having a bank give this kind of pre-announcement is very
encouraging,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at
Harris Private Bank in Chicago. ""It's giving a more positive
tone to the market in general.""

 U.S. crude  was up $1.46 to $73.44 a barrel, having
fallen to $71.44 earlier.
 ICE Brent crude futures  were up $1.50 at $72.95.
 U.S. Treasuries slid and Bund futures shed earlier gains to
settle lower after the State Street outlook improved risk
appetite and curbed demand for safe-haven government debt.
 Bund futures  fell to a session low of 129.12 as
equities turned higher, but trading volumes were thin ahead of

 The modest pullback in bonds did not dispel chatter over a

the Federal Reserve will keep short-term interest rates near
zero well into the second half of 2011, analysts said.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro fell from seven-week
highs against the dollar on Wednesday on concerns about the
growth outlook for the global economy and plans to test the
financial health of European banks.
 European regulators on Wednesday haggled over what details
to reveal about stress tests of about 100 banks in a dispute
that could undermine confidence in the health checks on the
region's lenders.
 The euro eased after reaching $1.2663 on trading platform
EBS on Tuesday, its highest level in about seven weeks. It fell
0.2 percent to $1.2592 after worse-than-expected data showed
factory orders in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy,
fell for the first time this year in May. For more details see
 ""The euro remains vulnerable to another downturn as
investors begin to look to the 16-member bloc's growth
prospects amid a back drop of strict budget cuts and the
potential for another downturn in the global economy,"" said
Omer Esiner, a chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington, DC.
 Traders said the euro may be hemmed in as options with
strike prices at $1.2500 and $1.2600 expire later in the day.
 ""There's still an awful lot of uncertainty in Europe and
the stress tests are the next big event... If growth concerns
return then Europe will be worse hit than the U.S.,"" said Derek
Halpenny, European head of global currency research at BTM-UFJ.
 EURO UPSIDE LIMITED
 The euro gained support earlier this week after a solid
Spanish syndicated debt sale on Tuesday eased euro zone debt
fears and weak U.S. data hit the dollar.
 Analysts said the single currency could rise further in the
short term as a raft of weak U.S. data prompts investors to
unwind long dollar positions and short euro positions built up
since the start of the year.
 Still, most analysts in a Reuters poll believe the euro
will stay weak against the dollar over the coming year. The
survey of about 60 analysts, taken July 2-7, predicted the euro
would fall to $1.24 in one month and $1.20 in three months,
then to $1.18 in six months and in mid-2011.
 ""A further deterioration of growth momentum in the U.S.
would also directly and exponentially impact growth conditions
in the Eurozone, putting the banking sector at additional
risk,"" said Manuel Oliveri, a currency analyst at UBS AG.
 Traders said the world's other major central banks may also
need to ease policies further in the event of a U.S. double-dip
and that the implications for currencies were far from clear.
 ""Flow wise, a trend of structural outflows from the Euro
zone remains fully intact,"" said Oliveri in a note to clients.
""Without long-term oriented flows returning, any further upside
in the single currency will likely remain limited.""
 YEN GAINS
 The dollar fell 0.3 percent to 87.28 yen, not far from a
seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit on EBS last week.
 Against other currencies, the greenback pared losses made
on Tuesday after a lackluster report on the U.S. service sector
added to data suggesting recovery in the world's largest
economy is slowing. U.S. shares built on Tuesday's gains, with
energy shares among top advancers.
 The dollar index edged up 0.3 percent to 84.10, rising off
a two-month low of 83.825 hit earlier this week. The
Australian dollar, which has a strong correlation with Asian
shares, fell 0.2 percent to $0.8508. And the New Zealand dollar
traded above the 55-day simple moving average for the second
straight day after breaking it and closing below it on June 29,
according to Reuters data.
 The kiwi was last up 0.6 percent at $0.6990.

 * U.S. exports up 17 percent in Jan to April - White House
 * Obama names remaining members of his Export Council
(Recasts lede, adds business reaction, China currency report)
 By Alister Bull and Steve Holland
 WASHINGTON, July 7 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama
called for a level playing field for U.S. companies in China on
Wednesday and pledged to push ahead with free trade deals with
three other nations.
 In an attempt to create jobs through export growth and
reassure U.S. business leaders that he is committed to trade,
Obama singled out China as a key market where American firms
would like to sell.
 ""Our discussion with China has also addressed the important
challenge of how to create a more level playing field for
American companies seeking to expand their access to the
growing Chinese market,"" Obama said.
 General Electric Co  CEO Jeffrey Immelt was quoted
last week as saying the Chinese government was growing
increasingly protectionist and his manufacturing conglomerate
was eyeing better prospects elsewhere.
 Obama again ""welcomed China's decision to allow its
currency to appreciate in response to market forces,"" which
Washington says will help make U.S. exports more competitive.
 The Obama administration is expected to decline to name
China as a currency manipulator in a regular report to Congress
that could be delivered any day.
 Obama vowed to push ahead with trade agreements and seek
approval for stalled deals with three countries, in an
acceleration of his trade agenda to boost growth by doubling
exports in 5 years.
 ""At a time when jobs are in short supply, building exports
is an imperative. But this isn't just about where jobs are
today. This is where American jobs will be tomorrow,"" Obama
said as he delivered a progress report on the ambitious export
target for 2015 that he announced in January.
 Last month Obama laid out a timetable for a long-delayed free
trade agreement with South Korea, and said on Wednesday he wanted
to iron out remaining issues related to U.S. trade deals with
Panama and Colombia.
 ""We're focused on submitting them as soon as possible for
congressional consideration,"" he said, but gave no timeline.
 U.S. growth has returned after a severe recession, but hopes
for an enduring upturn -- and a lift to hiring that pulls back
U.S. unemployment from levels near 10 percent -- will depend in
large part on the strength of its sales abroad.
 Obama has been criticized by some in the business community
for not being a convincing free-trade advocate, as well as for
overly optimistic forecasts on export growth that will require
more commitment to open up trade than he has shown so far.
 ""We're looking for the president to have a robust trade
agenda that will create jobs in our economy. The answer is not
just talking about it, but acting on it,"" said Myron Brilliant
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
 But Obama must navigate a delicate domestic political path
in an election year as he pushes free trade. Some members of
his own Democratic Party, and its backers in organized labor,
fear trade can hurt U.S. workers more than it helps American
business unless fair play is enforced.
 EXPORTED RECOVERY
 The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates
rising U.S. exports have added more than 1 percentage point to
U.S. growth in the last nine months, making a more significant
contribution to the recovery than domestic spending.
 The administration says it has run 18 trade missions to
lift U.S. sales overseas, doubled loans to support exports and
fought for fair trade at the World Trade Organization.
 ""As a result of these policies, and a global economic
rebound, exports in the first four months of 2010 grew almost
17 percent from the same period last year,"" the White House
said in its progress report on Obama's export push.
 ""This puts the U.S. on track to reach the president's goal
of doubling exports and supporting several million new jobs
over five years."" Obama announced the target in his State of
the Union address in January.
 Skeptics questioned whether this pace was sustainable.
 ""While the President will likely focus on current trade stats,
the real question is where are we headed?"" Republicans from the
House of Representatives said in a statement.
 ""We hope that the President will follow through on his
commitment to finish the South Korea agreement and that he will
also challenge Democrats in Congress to begin work on Colombia
and Panama,"" they said.
 Doubt over the pace of Europe's recovery has focused U.S.
attention on tapping into demand from China and other rising
economic powers.
 The White House says a South Korean trade deal, which needs
approval from Congress, where it still faces opposition, would
increase exports by an estimated $10 billion to $11 billion and
support an estimated 70,000 jobs.
 Obama has re-created a presidential Export Council made up
of some of the country's top chief executives to foster ideas
to boost sales overseas.
 On Wednesday he named the remaining members of the
20-person council, following up on his March announcement of
Boeing chief Jim McNerney to chair the council and Ursula Burns,
head of Xerox Corporation, as vice chair.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Global stocks turned higher on
Wednesday on a brighter outlook for banks on both sides of the
Atlantic while oil prices snapped a six-day slide on an
expected fall in U.S. crude inventories.
 A higher earnings outlook from State Street Corp ,
the world's No. 2 custodian bank, lifted Wall Street as
European shares turned positive. Banks pared losses on hopes
the results from impending stress tests may not be as bad as
feared.
 Worries about the strength of economic recovery were offset
after State Street said it would post second-quarter operating
earnings of 93 cents a share, compared to forecasts of 72 cents
a share. For details, see [ID:nN07140060]
 ""The earnings data provided by State Street is one of the
key factors boosting the market today,"" said Nick Kalivas, an
analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
 Kalivas said investors were starting to reposition ahead of
earnings season next week, and the State Street forecast
reinforced expectations that banks would perform well, without
exposure to trading.
 U.S. banks rallied after losing heavily in recent weeks,
with the BKW bank index <.BKX> up 2.6 percent.
 The STOXX Europe 600 banking index <.SX7P> rose 0.4
percent, reversing earlier sharp losses.
 The Committee of European Bank Supervisors was expected to
outline its methodology for a stress test that simulates the
impact of a severe economic shock on about 100 banks in the
euro zone and other countries, sources said. [ID:nLDE6660SG]
 Analysts also took a benign view of a slide in German
manufacturing orders for the first time this year in May. They
said it was mostly a technical correction as industrial
production in Europe's largest economy continued to recover.

0.7 percent, but its emerging market index <.MSCIEF> remained

percent, to 1,039.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added
21.62 points, or 1.03 percent, to 2,115.50.
 The euro fell from seven-week highs against the dollar amid
lingering concerns about the growth outlook for the global
economy and as investors scrutinized details of the financial
test for European banks. [ID:nN07238217]
 The euro  was down 0.05 percent at $1.2617. Against
the yen, the dollar  dipped 0.31 percent at 87.28.
 The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> off 0.11 percent at 83.991.
 As Wall Street rallied, safe-have assets like bonds fell.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was

 Crude oil gained. Andy Sommer, energy market analyst with

 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - With markets unconvinced that
stress tests on 100 European banks will be stringent enough,
policymakers are carefully balancing secrecy and disclosure.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero in particular -- markets are most
concerned about the Spanish and German banking systems -- must
carefully manage expectations to keep any shocks to a minimum.
 There is a growing acknowledgement that what might be
perceived as the most reassuring outcome on July 23 -- all of
the 100 or so banks passing -- could very well leave markets
even more sceptical about the quality and depth of the tests.
 The alternative is one or more banks failing, but that would
likely exacerbate the uncertainty and could provoke exactly what
policymakers want to avoid -- a full-scale banking crisis.
 ""The market is so convinced that there are issues in the
banking system that if the results don't show that some banks
are severely undercapitalised, it will be confirmation in itself
that the tests have not gone far enough,"" said Nicolas Veron, a
senior fellow at Breugel, a Brussels-based think tank.
 ""That's not just market prejudice,"" he said. ""There is
plenty of anecdotal and other evidence that some banks are in
severe trouble, particularly with their lending behaviour.""
 Merkel and Zapatero's strategy will be key.
 That may involve insisting that a high degree of detail on
how the tests were conducted and what was measured is provided
ahead of the July 23 disclosure date so that there is clarity
rather than a risk of confusion on the day.
 In that regard, the publication of the results, to be made
by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in
London, should mirror the way the United States handled the
results of its banking stress tests last year, analysts say.
 ""You need a lot of market savvy and coordination to make
sure that the interplay of rumours and leaks and surprises
doesn't result in a big rise in market volatility,"" said Veron.
 ""In a way, it will be a test of the collective
professionalism of Europe's financial policymakers,"" he said,
and by extension the leaders of those European countries where
the risk of problems being exposed is greatest.
 ""The U.S. authorities treated the management of expectations
and disclosure itself very skilfully. That's a point of
reference against which Europe will be measured.""
 
 ""OVER-EXPOSURE?""
 Spain has to an extent been managing expectations since a
European Union summit on June 17, when EU-wide stress tests were
formally agreed. From the start, Madrid pushed for the results
to be made public on a bank-by-bank basis, something Germany and
other EU member states were originally reluctant to do.
 French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has also been at
the forefront of those trying to provide clarity, announcing
last weekend that the test results would be published on July 23
and promising that the criteria would be known in advance.
 ""You will see that the banks in Europe are solid and
healthy,"" she told reporters, adding when asked about French
banks: ""I'm not worried about my banks.""
 Sources have told Reuters that CEBS will outline its
methodology for the tests on Wednesday and could also provide
details of those banks which are participating, although it is
still not clear which German banks will take part.
 The tests are expected to include scenarios on the expected
impact of possible write-downs of euro zone sovereign bond
holdings, and will vary for banks in different countries since
country-risk profiles differ widely, the sources said.
 The greatest risk appears to attain to Germany, not just
because of the perceived lending exposure of some of its banks,
but because of its reluctance to commit to the same levels of
stress-test transparency as others, and the fact that Merkel's
coalition government is already under severe strain.
 In an analysis of the potential outcome of the tests,
assuming the application of stresses such as lower than expected
GDP growth and a 10 percent decline in property prices, Swiss
bank UBS identified Germany and Spain as two of the major risks.
 ""We believe a stress outcome in the Spanish market could be
substantially greater than some other markets,"" the bank said in
a 30-page study that examined multiple scenarios.
 For Spain, with nearly 20 percent unemployment, slow growth
and a high budget deficit, the added pressure of poor test
results could prove debilitating for Zapatero's government.
 And for Germany, the risks may not only come from within,
but from its exposure to other countries as its banking system
is so large and so widely tapped into by other, weaker states.
 ""Different banking systems have very different amounts of
exposure to potentially challenged economies,"" UBS said. ""The
extent of the German system's exposure to other economies is
particularly evident.""

 A European committee of bank supervisors will outline on

the top spot last month in the Reuters foreign exchange accuracy
league for 2010 thanks mainly to wrong-footed calls on the
dollar made by 4Cast, who were number one the month before.
 Goldman, which has scored a total of 588 out of a maximum
900 points, lagged 4Cast by just 10 points in the May table
leaving them very little ground to gain to reclaim the lead.
 A relatively accurate call on sterling also helped propel
Goldman back to the top of the table.
 Aurel BGC, which has claimed top spot twice this year and is
currently in second place, has scored a total of 559 points
whereas Wells Fargo was just nine points behind, clinching third
place.
 For the month of June alone, BNP Paribas made the most
accurate forecasts for dollar rates, scoring well on their
predictions for the yen.
 Another notable move in June was UniCredit MIB's leapfrog to
the fourth slot from the previous month's 12th position, thanks
to a perfect call on euro/dollar.
 The June poll reflected widespread downgrades on euro/dollar
forecasts after no strategists got their euro calls close in the
May poll while markets still struggled to assess the potential
damage from the European debt crisis.
 Focus shifted in June to the battered single currency and
strategists took their eyes off the yen and sterling, missing
their quick appreciation against the greenback. Just 19 of 55
outperformed the Reuters consensus for sterling last month.
 Reuters analyses the accuracy of the contributors based on
how closely their one-month forecasts compare with the actual
closing rates on the last trading day of each month.
 They are then assigned scores, with the forecaster who
diverged by the least amount from the actual close given 50
points. The bank which gave the second most accurate forecast
gets 49 points.
 The three scores are then added with the highest score
claiming first place. Points from the January to June polls were
added up to give a running total.
 The 20 highest scoring banks, along with their scores, are

 * Emergency budget cited as positive factor for UK currency
 * Pound seen at $1.49 in 12 months, to strengthen vs euro
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The toughness of Britain's
austerity budget unveiled last month persuaded foreign exchange
strategists to notch up sterling forecasts for the first time in
seven months, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
 In the first Reuters survey of around 60 forex analysts
since the new government's emergency budget, median forecasts
showed the pound dipping from around $1.51 now to $1.46 in six
months, before recovering to $1.49 in 12 months.
 Last month's poll, conducted the week before the June 10
budget, saw the pound flat at $1.45 across the one-year outlook.
 While respondents were still pessimistic about sterling
regaining any strength from now, Wednesday's poll was the first
this year to show an upwardly revised outlook for the UK
currency.
 New Finance Minister George Osborne's budget was one of the
toughest in generations, designed to tackle Britain's worst
peace-time budget deficit with heavy spending cuts and increased
sales taxes.
 ""The strong UK emergency budget has restored confidence and
dismissed speculation about a possible UK (credit rating)
downgrade,"" said Roberto Mialich of UniCredit MIB.
 But whatever the positive implications of the budget for
sterling, worrying signs of weakness ahead for the world economy
were also at the forefront of forecasters' concerns.
 Forward-looking indicators like purchasing managers indexes
and sentiment surveys point to a marked slowdown in growth in
major world economies in coming quarters as austerity measures
kick in.
 
 RANGE OF UNCERTAINTY
 Reflecting such heightened uncertainty, the range of
forecasts for the 12-month outlook widened from 43 cents in June
to 47 cents in the latest poll.
 ""It is a big question whether the austerity plan will derail
the recovery,"" said Niels Christensen of Nordea.
 ""Data releases in the near future will be a big test for
sterling as the big theme on FX markets turn towards the
sustainability of the economic recovery in an environment where
fiscal tightening is high on the political agenda.""
 Washington policymakers like U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner warned last month that big European states risk a
return to recession if they were to cut spending too hard and
too fast.
 Forex strategists upgraded their forecasts for the pound
against the euro, according to cross rates calculated by
Reuters.
 They saw the euro weakening through the year to 82 pence in
three months, 81 pence in six months and 80 pence in 12 months,
down from around 83.2 pence on Wednesday.
 ""The outlook for sterling, particularly against the euro,
has improved further,"" said Meng Jiao of Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch.
 ""The emergency budget ... forecasts an elimination of the
UK's structural deficit by 2015, largely removing concerns that
the UK may soon lose its AAA sovereign debt rating. To reflect
this we have lowered our EUR-GBP forecast.""
 The British economy is expected to fare better than the euro
zone's, growing 1.1 percent this year and 2.1 percent next,
outstripping forecasts for 1.0 and 1.5 percent growth
respectively in the 16-nation bloc.
 The latest poll also revealed an expectation that cable
trade would be slightly less volatile this month, based on
calculations derived from the standard deviation of forecasts.
 It implied annualised sterling volatility easing to 9
percent in July, from 10.9 percent in June.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro will stay weak against
the dollar over the coming year and in six months it will break
below the four-year low it sank to in June, according to the
latest Reuters foreign exchange poll.
 The poll of around 60 analysts, taken July 2-7, predicted
the euro would fall to $1.24 in one month and $1.20 in three
months, then to $1.18 in six months and in mid-2011.
 These longer-term views are barely changed from last month's
poll and analysts gave a relatively low 10 percent median chance
the euro would hit parity with the greenback by the end of the
year. That consensus is down from 20 percent in June.
 One bank, BNP Paribas, forecast the euro would be worth less
than the dollar in a year, the first below-parity forecast
collected by Reuters in more than six years. BNP Paribas was the
most accurate FX forecaster in the June poll.
 The euro has been battered by worries over the debts of
Greece and other euro area members but has recovered a fair
amount of ground from a four-year nadir last month.
 ""We expect EUR/USD to remain under pressure as fiscal
problems in the euro area continue to weigh,"" said Kamal Sharma
at JP Morgan.
 The euro slid a little from a seven-week high on Tuesday,
knocking down to $1.2478, but well above the four-year low of
$1.1875 it sank to last month.
 Only one strategist out of 46 said the European Central Bank
(ECB) will intervene in currency markets this year to prop up
its currency compared with two of 37 in the June poll.
 Twelve-month forecasts were in a relatively wide range of
$0.98-$1.35, highlighting uncertainty in the market. But there
was also a sense from the numbers and analysts' comments that
the worst of the euro's woes may be over.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 In mid-December the euro slid beneath the cloud on the
Ichimoku chart, the Japanese chart pattern closely followed
across markets, and has mostly traded below it since then. But
its rise back into the cloud suggests the shared currency may
have entered a consolidation phase.
 ""More and more signs that focus is shifting from budget
problems in Europe to concern about slower growth in the United
States have the U.S. dollar vulnerable,"" said Niels Christensen
at Nordea.
In the second half of last year the euro zone economy
emerged from its worst post-war recession, and grew 0.2 percent
in the first three months of 2010. It is expected to do little
more than tick over in coming quarters.
 The U.S. economy bounced back more strongly. But recent
evidence of a stubbornly weak labour market and a cooling off in
manufacturing and services business activity have raised fears
about a double-dip recession.
 The slow economic recovery of the 16-nation bloc and
intensifying austerity measures mean the ECB is not seen raising
rates from their record low of 1.0 percent until the third
quarter of 2011.
 
 STERLING STRONGER
 Against sterling the euro is forecast to lose further
ground as the Bank of England is seen raising rates in the
second quarter of next year and unwinding its loose monetary
policy slightly sooner than the ECB.
 Cross rates calculated by Reuters show the euro trading at
83 pence in one month, 81p in six months and then 80p in a year.
That compares to respective 84p, 82p and 81p forecasts in June's
poll.
 The British economy is seen faring better than the euro
zone's, growing 1.1 percent this year and 2.1 percent next,
outstripping forecasts for 1.0 and 1.4 percent growth
respectively in the bloc.
 As risk aversion subsides, the euro was seen gaining a
little ground versus the yen, having slumped to an 8-1/2 year
low against the Japanese currency in June. It was expected to
strengthen to be worth 115 yen in 12 months' time from the 109.6
it was trading at earlier on Wednesday.
 ""If, as we expect, risk aversion originally triggered by the
European crisis subsides relatively soon, the yen should restore
a gradual downward trend,"" said Meng Jiao at BofA-ML.
 Euro volatility against the dollar was seen rising to 14
percent over the coming month, compared to actual volatility of
10.4 percent last month. Analysts say the divergence of
forecasts in Reuters currency polls offers a leading indicator
of exchange rate volatility in the following month.

568,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2010 09:16AM ET</span>",POLL-BNP Paribas most accurate in June Reuters forex poll," BANGALORE, July 7 (Reuters) - BNP Paribas made the most
accurate one-month forecasts for dollar rates against major
currencies in the June Reuters foreign exchange poll, scoring
best on their predictions for the yen.
 They forecast the dollar to end the month at 88 yen, nearly
spot on the actual close of 88.39. BNP forecast sterling to end
June at $1.470 and the euro at $1.220, compared with actual
closes of $1.495 and $1.2234.
 This scored BNP a total of 139 points out of a maximum
possible score of 150. They were followed by Julius Baer and
RBC, which tied for second place with scores of 126.
 The yen, which surged to a 2010 high against the dollar of
86.94 on July 1, proved to be the hardest to predict, ending
last month 3 percent stronger at 88.39.
 BNP was one of the very few strategists who got that call
nearly right. Only three others among 56 top FX dealers saw the
dollar below 90 yen at the end of June.
 ""With the current high levels of risk aversion, we're seeing
the Japanese investors slowing their outflows,"" said Ian
Stannard at BNP Paribas, who expects dollar/yen to stay below 90
in the next six months and surge to 101 by mid next year.
 ""In the near-term we'd be looking for yen to keep the
pressure on the downside, maybe even dipping slightly lower
towards the 85 area,"" Stannard added.
 He foresees a more sustained recovery developing towards the
end of this year and beginning of next year.
 Last month's poll also showed the euro weakening over a
twelve-month horizon. The outlook was uncertain, however, given
the wide range of forecasts, which ranged from parity to $1.60.
 The 16-nation bloc's currency tumbled to a four-year low in
early June at $1.1875. Just three of 56 strategists polled last
month saw the euro at or below $1.18 on a one-month horizon.
 Weaker housing data in the U.S., still-high unemployment and
signs of a slowing global economy re-fuelled worries about a
double-dip recession and sent stock markets tumbling.
 Investors channelled money into safe havens like U.S.
government bonds and the Japanese yen.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2010 09:08AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Soccer-World-Soccer pulls investors into African orbit," * World Cup sparks business, fund interest in Africa
 * Foreigners pile into South African stocks during Cup
 * Shifting perceptions point to long-term gains
 
 By Ed Cropley, African Investment Correspondent
 JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Reuters) - To greed and fear, you can
now add soccer.
 The buzz from Africa's first soccer World Cup is being heard
in investment houses across the globe, drawing new business and
even capital to a continent that has evolved in the last decade
from international basket-case to fast-growing frontier market.
 ""There's definitely been a pick-up in flows from Europe.
There's no doubt about that,"" said John Mackie, head of African
investments at Johannesburg-based Stanlib, which manages $300
million in sub-Saharan Africa's frontier markets.
 His comments, supported by several other fund managers, are
the first signs of South Africa accruing some of the
""intangible"" benefits needed to recoup the 40 billion rand ($5.2
billion) it spent on new stadia and upgrading roads and railways
for the month-long soccer spectacular.
 Analysts estimate the foreign fans who turned up -- full
arrivals numbers are not yet available -- will only inject 13
billion rand into the economy, while the government says the
tournament should boost 2010 growth by 0.4 percentage points.
 However, in the long-run it believes Africa's biggest
economy will more than recover its costs through the rebranding
of a nation noted mainly for violent crime, thereby attracting
more tourists and investment.
 The investment side already appears to be working as
businessmen and money managers the world over have tuned in to
watch a smoothly run tournament staged in packed and spectacular
stadia before enthusiastic and well-behaved fans.
 It is a far cry from the popular external image of Africa as
a hopeless and hapless continent more accustomed to making
headlines through war, pestilence, famine and death.
 ""People are sitting in Denmark and France and the UK saying
'That stadium looks a hell of a lot better than anything we've
got here, and it looks like it works and everybody's still
alive,'"" Mackie said.
 ""There's no question it's changing perceptions.""
 
 LONG-SHOT FROM JAPAN
 Anecdotal evidence even suggests the soccer has swayed
investment decisions as it has reached a television audience of
billions in every corner of the globe.
 Cape Town-based Investec Asset Management, the funds arm of
South African bank Investec , reported inflated
interest from Japanese investors in a recently launched $200
million African commodities fund the day after Japan advanced to
the knockout stages.
 ""After Japan won the football match we got another big
subscription the next day,"" Global Business Development director
John Green told Reuters.
 Not everybody is quite so hasty, although serious investor
interest -- pricked in part by ""Lion on the Move"", a weighty and
overwhelmingly positive report on Africa released last month by
consultancy McKinsey -- has never been as intense.
 ""It hasn't necessarily led to flows yet but the right
questions are being asked,"" said Simone Lowe of Thames River
Capital, who oversees a $50 million fund investing in South
Africa and less-developed markets such as Nigeria and Kenya.
 ""The interest is coming from all over -- the U.S., UK and
Europe. Obviously South Africa has been at the forefront, but
the interest is definitely more widely spread.""
 
 BUYING AFRICA
 Market data backs up the hearsay.
 Foreigners have been net buyers of South African equities in
three of the four weeks since the World Cup started, according
to the Johannesburg stock market.
 Overall, during the tournament they have bought $398 million
of South African stocks, even though the bourse's Top 40 index
<.JTOPI> has dropped 2.6 percent and underperformed other
emerging equity markets <.MSCIEF> by more than 4 percent.
 The ripples have been felt further afield.
 Four days after 19 million people in the United States --
the biggest soccer audience in U.S. history -- tuned in to watch
their side lose to Ghana, the West African state's landmark 2007
eurobond  strengthened dramatically.
 By contrast, a eurobond <362420AA9=RRPS> from fellow
frontier African economy Gabon which normally moves in lockstep
with the Ghana issue was unmoved.
 The sort of television exposure enjoyed by Ghana, as well as
reports filtering back from South Africa by word of mouth,
suggest businessmen and potential tourists are looking at the
entire region with new eyes.
 ""I'd been led to believe that everybody who went to the
World Cup was going to be kidnapped or murdered but it just
hasn't happened,"" said Matthew Cooksley, a London-based
management consultant.
 ""All my mates who went said they had the most fantastic time
and the atmosphere was incredible.""

(Updates with analysts' comments, details)
 By Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth in
the first three months of 2010 was confirmed on Wednesday at 0.2
percent quarter-on-quarter, and 0.6 percent on the year, but any
stronger expansion in the second quarter could be short-lived.
 European Union statistics office Eurostat said in its second
estimate for the first quarter that inventories had helped the
16-country euro area's economy grow modestly over the period
despite negative net trade, investment and consumer demand.
 Inventories contributed 1.0 percentage point to overall
quarterly growth, more than the 0.8 percent reported previously.
 Government spending made a neutral contribution and exports
added 0.9 percentage point, slightly less than previously
thought.
 Imports, however, subtracted 1.3 percentage points. Falling
investment and household demand took away 0.2 percentage point
and 0.1 point respectively, it said.
 ""The breakdown of first-quarter euro zone GDP on the
expenditure side did not make attractive reading. Growth was
driven by inventories while consumer spending disappointingly
contracted anew and investment saw further marked contraction,""
said Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Insight.
 Many economists expect euro zone growth to accelerate to
0.4-0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period, but
expansion could later falter because of austerity measures
ordered by many governments to avoid a sovereign debt crisis.
 Persistently high unemployment -- which at 10 percent in May
was close to a 12-year high -- is likely to keep a lid on
consumer demand, which is key to economic growth.
 ""The Eurozone still faces significant obstacles to robust
growth, and we suspect that growth will moderate anew in the
second half of the year after the likely spike up in the second
quarter,"" said Archer.
 In the first quarter, the euro zone's two largest economies
-- France and Germany -- expanded by 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent
respectively from the previous three-month period.
 Greece, hit by a debt crisis, contracted more than
previously thought -- by 1.0 percent, compared with the previous
reading of 0.8 percent. Italy grew by 0.4 percent, rather than
0.5 percent as reported by Eurostat in early June.
 Poor growth prospects are likely to have cemented
expectations that the European Central Bank will keep its main
interest rate at 1.0 percent far into 2011.
 The European Commission, the EU executive, expects the euro
zone to reach full-year growth of 0.9 percent in 2010, compared
with a 2.1 percent contraction in 2009.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2010 06:04AM ET</span>",U.S. on track to double exports in 5 years - Obama," * U.S. exports up 17 percent in Jan to April - White House
 * Obama to name remaining members of his Export Council
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, July 7 (Reuters) - The United States is on
track to double its exports within five years, President Barack
Obama will say on Wednesday, as he fills out a high-powered
private sector council to help reach that goal.
 ""Boosting America's exports strengthens our economic growth
and supports millions of good, high-paying American jobs,""
Obama will say in a progress report on the ambitious target he
announced during his State of the Union address in January.
 U.S. growth has returned after a severe recession but hopes
for an enduring upturn -- and a lift to hiring that pulls back
U.S. unemployment from levels near 10 percent -- will depend in
large part on the strength of its sales abroad.
 The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates
rising U.S. exports have added more than 1 percentage point to
U.S. growth in the last nine months, making a more significant
contribution to the recovery than domestic spending.
 ""My administration has worked to improve advocacy for our
exporters, remove trade barriers, and enforce trade rules in an
effort to ensure that the benefits of global trade are broadly
shared,"" Obama will say, according to remarks prepared for his
delivery at the White House at 11:25 a.m. (1525 GMT).
 The administration says it has run 18 trade missions to
lift U.S. sales overseas, doubled loans to support exports and
fought for fair trade at the World Trade Organization.
 ""As a result of these policies, and a global economic
rebound, exports in the first four months of 2010 grew almost
17 percent from the same period last year,"" the White House
said in its progress report on Obama's export push.
 ""This puts the U.S. on track to reach the president's goal
of doubling exports and supporting several million new jobs
over five years.""
 At the same time, doubt over the pace of Europe's recovery
has focused U.S. attention on tapping into demand from China
and other rising economic powers.
 Obama announced a timeline to complete a free trade deal
with South Korea at a Group of 20 meeting in Toronto in late
June, while maintaining pressure on China to let its currency
rise, which Washington hopes will aid U.S. exports.
 The White House says a South Korean trade deal, which needs
approval from Congress where it still faces opposition, would
increase exports by an estimated $10 billion to $11 billion and
support an estimated 70,000 jobs.
 Obama says raising exports is a national priority and has
created an Export Council made up of some of the country's top
chief executives to foster ideas. On Wednesday, he will name
the remaining members of the 20-strong council.
 ""I am confident that their depth of experience in the
private sector will be valuable as we continue working to open
new markets for American goods, boost our exports and level the
playing field for American workers,"" Obama will say.
 In March, Obama named Boeing Co chief Jim McNerney to chair
the Export Council and Ursula Burns, head of Xerox Corp, as
vice chair.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2010 05:48AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-French trade data raises doubts over Q2 growth," * Trade deficit highest since October 2008
 * Exports slump 5.2 percent on the month
 * Sales of aeronautics, oil products weigh

(Adds detail, analyst comment)
 By Vicky Buffery
 PARIS, July 7 (Reuters) - A steep drop in exports drove
France's trade deficit to a 19-month high, data showed on
Wednesday, casting a shadow over second-quarter growth in the
euro zone's second-largest economy.
 But analysts cast off fears of a long-term slump in foreign
sales, saying May's decline was caused by volatile exports of
aeronautical goods and refined oil products.
 The customs office said France's trade deficit widened to
5.5 billion euros in May from 4.26 billion in April, far
exceeding the consensus estimate of 4.0 billion in a poll of
analysts by Reuters.
 ""Foreign trade's recent dynamism suffered a severe setback
in May, which suggests a smaller contribution of net exports to
Q2 growth,"" said Dominique Barbet, economist at BNP Paribas.
 ""Nevertheless, the export fall is very much concentrated on
refined petroleum products and aircrafts, and both should be
mainly transitory,"" he said.
 Imports totalled 35.386 billion, down slightly from 35.790
billion the month before.
 But exports dropped to 29.886 billion euros in May, a 5.2
percent decline from April's 31.532 billion.
 
 VOLATILE AIRCRAFT SALES
 Foreign sales of transport goods slumped to 5.679 billion
from 7.109 billion a month earlier, attributed to a 1.5 billion
euro decline in major aeronautical contracts.
 Sales of Airbus aircraft alone fell to 1.05 billion euros
from 1.94 billion in April.
 Meanwhile, exports of refined petroleum products fell to 823
million euros from 1.01 billion a month earlier.
 In other industrial sectors, however, exports remained
largely unchanged month-on-month.
 ""Aerospace contracts are by nature volatile, so you can't
really say from these figures that the (upward) trend in French
exports has ended,"" said Alberto Balboni, economist at
Paris-based consultancy Xerfi.
 Prior to May's figures, exports had been rising steadily for
six straight months, buoyed by a pick-up in global trade.
 Indeed, foreign trade helped support French gross domestic
product in the first quarter of the year, offsetting negative
contributions from domestic consumption and inventory changes
and allowing France to eke out a meagre 0.1 percent growth.
 May's slump raises the possibility that this support may
have waned in the second quarter, posing a threat to economic
growth.
 Consumer spending has remained sluggish so far for the
quarter, while the latest PMI surveys for manufacturing have
shown that support from the inventory cycle may have fallen off.
 French statistics office INSEE expects French GDP to have
expanded by 0.5 percent between the months of April and June,
putting the country on target to meet the government's full-year
growth target of 1.4 percent.
 But the government has said it could revise downwards its
2010 forecast if second-quarter GDP data due in August, proves
disappointing. Economy Minister Christine Lagarde on Tuesday
maintained the 2010 growth forecast.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2010 05:08AM ET</span>",Euro zone Q1 GDP growth confirmed at 0.2 pct q/q," BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth in
the first three months of 2010 was confirmed on Wednesday at 0.2
percent quarter-on-quarter and 0.6 percent on the year, but any
stronger expansion in the second quarter could be short-lived.
 In its second estimate, European Union statistics office
Eurostat reiterated that inventories helped the 16-country
area's economy grow modestly over the period despite negative
net trade, investment and consumer demand.
 Inventories contributed 1.0 percentage point to overall
quarterly growth, more than the 0.8 percent reported previously.
 Government spending made a neutral contribution and exports
added 0.9 percentage point, slightly less than previously
thought.
 Imports, however, subtracted 1.3 percentage points. Falling
investment and household demand took away 0.2 percentage point
and 0.1 point respectively, it said.
 Many economists expect euro zone growth to accelerate to 0.4
percent quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period, but
expansion could later falter due to austerity measures ordered
by many governments to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. 
 In the first quarter, the euro zone's two largest economies
-- France and Germany -- expanded by 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent
respectively from the previous three-month period.
 Greece, hit by a debt crisis, contracted more than
previously thought -- by 1.0 percent, compared with the previous
reading of 0.8 percent. Italy grew by 0.4 percent, rather than
0.5 percent as reported by Eurostat in early June.

 MANILA, July 7 (Reuters) - Moderate inflation in the
Philippines is not enough on its own to guarantee interest
rates will stay at a record low for the rest of the year, as
strong growth could fuel price pressures, a central bank
official said on Wednesday.
 The new government will review current economic goals on
Friday, and sources said the technical group that prepares the
numbers for approval would recommend keeping this year's growth
and inflation target ranges and raising next year's GDP target.
 Philippine inflation has been lower than expected in recent
months. Last month the central bank cut its inflation forecasts
for 2010 and 2011 to 4.7 percent and 3.6 percent, prompting
debt markets to push back the expected timing of a policy rate
rise.
 ""While the inflation environment continues to be benign, if
there are things in the horizon that could affect the
expectation of the general public that is something that we
need to look at,"" central bank deputy governor Diwa Guinigundo
told reporters on Wednesday.
 ""The other point is the strength or weakness of the global
and domestic economic recovery. If the recovery proves to be
more robust and more sustainable over the long run, that could
also result in some pressure on inflation.""
 The central bank has kept the policy rate at a record low
of 4 percent for nearly a year, and will next review policy on
July 15.
 Neighbouring Indonesia has signalled it intends to keep its
rates unchanged until next year, though analysts say it has to
start raising them by the fourth quarter of 2010 or the first
quarter of next year to avoid being behind the curve in
controlling inflation. [ID:nJAK190672]
 Despite strong economic growth, other central banks in the
region have also turned cautious in recent months as worries
grow about the fallout from Europe's debt crisis and an uneven
U.S. economic recovery.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia kept its key rate unchanged
on Tuesday for a second month after raising it 150 bps between
October and May, though policymakers in India are expected to
raise rates twice in July as they try to curb double-digit
inflation.
 On Tuesday, Philippine central bank Governor Amando
Tetangco told Reuters there was no urgent need to raise rates
and the previous government's upwardly revised 2010 growth
target of 5 to 6 percent was achieveable. [ID:nLDE66511O]
 That target range and others will be reviewed on Friday by
the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC), which
includes the central bank, finance and budget departments and
the economic planning agency.
 The DBCC will recommend the government of Benigno Aquino
III, which took office last week, should keep the GDP target
for this year and raise the 2011 target of 3.8-4.7 percent, two
sources said.
 Inflation target ranges for 2010 and 2011 of 3.5-5.5
percent and 3-5 percent, respectively, would be maintained,
while it would be recommended that export and import growth
targets for this year be raised, the sources said.
 The previous government had said exports were expected to
grow 12 percent and imports by 18 percent in 2010. Exports and
imports have rebounded strongly this year from the global
crisis.
 REVENUE UP
 The rebound in trade has helped government coffers.
Officials said the country's second-biggest revenue agency
would likely meet its collection goal this year after it
exceeded its first-half target of 124.1 billion pesos ($2.7
billion) by about 7 billion pesos. [ID:nMNA002807]
 The new government has said it would target better revenue
collections as a way to lower the budget deficit, which in turn
could reduce the borrowing needs of Asia's largest sovereign
issuer of foreign currency bonds in future years.
 The finance secretary said he wanted to change the mix of
the debt programme, looking to issue more longer-term debt and
raise the local currency component to limit foreign exchange
exposures.
 ""Our goal is to lengthen the maturities,"" Cesar Purisima
told reporters. ""We will consider all the instruments available
to us that offer right prices, cost, at the right time. It
really depends on the timing.""
 ""Our charter allow us to have a 25-year debt and so far our
current average is at 10 years,"" Purisima said.
 The Philippines was expected to borrow 488 billion pesos
this year from the local market and 220.5 billion pesos
overseas under a programme set by the previous government.

 By Lin Noueihed
 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped off a seven week
high on Wednesday on renewed concerns about the euro zone
banking system and the strength of global economic recovery.
 A European committee of bank supervisors is to outline on
Wednesday the methodology of a stress test on about 100 banks in
the euro zone and other countries, sources told Reuters.
 Analysts said the euro gained support after a solid Spanish
syndicated debt sale on Tuesday eased fears over euro zone debt
but markets would remain cautious until the bank stress test
results are released later this month.
 This means some market players are refraining from taking
long positions in the euro. 
 ""There's still an awful lot of uncertainty in Europe and the
stress tests are the next big event... If growth concerns return
then Europe will be worse hit than the U.S.,"" said Derek
Halpenny, European head of global currency research at BTM-UFJ.
 ""We're not forecasting a double dip recession but the
uncertainty over growth will persist in the next six months and
if that happens defensive currencies like the dollar will still
do well at the expense of euro.""
 The euro eased 0.4 percent to $1.2571 at 0833 GMT. It had
risen to $1.2663 on trading platform EBS on Tuesday, the highest
in about seven weeks.
 However, some traders said it could rise further as euro
zone debt fears recede and worries about the U.S. recovery hit
the dollar.
 It finished U.S. trading above resistance at the bottom of
the daily Ichimoku cloud -- a signal that its entrenched
downtrend may be over.
 The euro in mid-December slid beneath the cloud on the
Ichimoku chart, the Japanese chart pattern that is closely
followed across markets, and had mostly traded below it since
then. But its rise back into the cloud suggests that it has
entered a consolidation phase.
""The euro is in a retracement phase in the wake of its drop to
below $1.2 and could rise back towards the top of the cloud,""
said Tokichi Ito, deputy general manager for Trust & Custody
Services Bank's forex team. 
 
 DOLLAR SELLING
 The dollar fell 0.4 percent at 87.15 yen, not far from a
seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit on EBS last week.
 The greenback lost ground on Tuesday after a lacklustre
report on the U.S. service sector added to other recent data
suggesting consumer spending, housing and factory activity in
the world's largest economy was moderating.
 Equities markets also gave up Tuesday's gains, as
uncertainty over growth hit demand for risk.
 The dollar index edged up 0.2 percent to 84.269, staying
near a two-month low of 83.825 hit this week. 
 Traders said the world's other major central banks may also
need to ease policies further in the event of a U.S. double-dip
and that the implications for currencies were far from clear.
 ""The story in the U.S. is that the Federal Reserve may
return to quantitative easing. I would not rule it out but they
won't do it unless markets are very stressed,"" Halpenny said.
 The Australian dollar, which has had a strong correlation
with Asian shares and the market's risk appetite in general,
dipped 0.5 percent to $0.8480, giving back some of its 1.5
percent climb the previous day, as Asian share prices fell.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - New evidence that the U.S.
economic recovery is slowing pushed investors to sell shares on
Wednesday following a burst of bargain hunting the previous day.
 Wall Street also looked set for a weak start.
 European shares, however, came off their lows after two
banking sources in Germany told Reuters that stress tests for
European banks will not include changing the repayment
commitments of German sovereign bonds. [nWEA8808]
 Sovereign bonds of troubled Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece
and Spain would see significant stress tests, the sources said.
 Sentiment globally was hurt by the Institute for Supply
Management's reading on U.S. service sector activity on Tuesday
which showed growth in June, but at its slowest pace since
February, heightening concerns about sluggish economic recovery.
 Along with continued worries about euro zone sovereign debt,
the slowing pace of recovery, particularly in the United States,
has deterred investment in riskier assets.
 World stocks as measured by MSCI <.MIWD00000PUS> were down
half a percent having gained 1.7 percent on Tuesday. The Thomson
Reuters global stock index <.TRXFLDGLPU> was down 0.3 percent.
 ""The continuous stream of disappointing economic data
recently has been feeding the markets' worries about the
adequacy of underlying demand in the world when the fiscal
stimulus gets withdrawn,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment
strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 Investors are concerned about the impact of stimulus
programmes running their course, governments introducing harsh
spending cuts to combat burgeoning debt, and the eventual
raising of interest rates.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.6
percent having earlier lost around 1 percent. It closed up 2.6
percent on Tuesday, its biggest daily gain in about 5-1/2 weeks.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> ended down 0.6 percent but
the index remained above a seven-month low hit on Tuesday.

EURO SLIPS
 The euro slipped off a seven-week high with eyes on the
European stress tests.
 Analysts said the euro was nonetheless being supported after
a solid sale of Spanish syndicated debt in the previous session.
 ""There's still an awful lot of uncertainty in Europe and the
stress tests are the next big event ... If growth concerns
return then Europe will be worse hit than the U.S.,"" said Derek
Halpenny, European Head of Global Currency Research at BTM-UFJ.
 The euro  eased 0.2 percent to $1.2596, of its
session lows. It had risen to $1.2663 on trading platform EBS on
Tuesday, the highest in about seven weeks.
 The dollar was up 0.1 percent against a basket of
currencies.

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Wednesday but
was holding not far from a seven-week high, with traders saying
it could rise further in the near term due to doubts about a
recovery in the U.S. economy and positive technical signals.
 The euro eased 0.4 percent to $1.2578, after meeting
resistance around the May 21 high of $1.2673 and on selling from
a hedge fund. It hit $1.2663 on trading platform EBS on Tuesday,
the highest in about seven weeks.
 Still, one positive factor for the euro was the fact that it
finished Tuesday's U.S. trading above resistance at the bottom of
the daily Ichimoku cloud -- a signal that its entrenched
downtrend may be over.
 The euro in mid-December slid beneath the cloud on the
Ichimoku chart, the Japanese chart pattern that is closely
followed across markets, and had mostly traded below it since
then. But its rise back into the cloud suggests the
single-currency may have entered a consolidation phase.
 ""The euro is in a retracement phase in the wake of its drop
to below $1.2 and could rise back towards the top of the cloud,""
said Tokichi Ito, deputy general manager for Trust & Custody
Services Bank's forex team.
 While worries about the euro zone's debt woes linger and
market players refrain from actively taking long positions in the
euro, Ito said the euro may see a short-covering bounce towards
$1.2800, near the top of the daily Ichimoku cloud.
 The euro was also supported after a strong response to a
syndicated Spanish debt sale. The robust demand eased some of the
worries about the debt problems in the euro zone, although
traders said they would remain cautious until the stress test
results of the euro zone's banks are out later this month.
 ""What we are seeing is some position adjustment which is
driving the euro,"" said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist
at ANZ. ""The common theme that is gaining ground in currency
markets is the U.S. dollar is being weighed down by soft U.S.
economic numbers.""
 A Financial Times column headlined ""The ECB may yet turn to
quantitative easing"" was also a talking point in the market,
mildly pressuring the euro.
 Traders said that the world's other major central banks may
also need to ease policies further in the event of a U.S.
double-dip and that the implications for currencies were far from
clear.
 The dollar index edged up 0.2 percent to 84.235, staying near
a two-month low of 83.825 hit this week. The dollar index lost
ground on Tuesday after a lacklustre report on business activity
in the U.S. service sector.
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 87.49 yen, not far
from a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit on EBS last week.
 The yen has made solid gains against the greenback in recent
sessions on the back of growing worries about an economic
slowdown in the United States and falling stock markets.
 Those concerns got a boost from a disappointing jobs report
from the U.S. late last week. That followed a raft of weak
reports which suggested consumer spending, housing and factory
activity were moderating.
 ""I think what we will see for a while is dollar selling,
coupled with bouts of backing off from risk-taking when there are
any sharp falls in equities,"" said Akira Hoshino, chief manager
for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange trading
department.
 The yen is one currency that may benefit in this market
environment, Hoshino said.
 Market players said the yen took in stride a Kyodo news
agency poll showing that Japan's ruling Democratic Party could
win fewer than 50 seats in an upper house election on Sunday,
a result that could put Prime Minister Naoto Kan's job on the
line and stall efforts to curb huge public debt.
 ""It is hard for the market to show a definite reaction,"" said
Osamu Takashima, chief fx strategist Japan for Citibank Japan.
 While a political crisis for the ruling party could be
regarded as a negative for a country's currency, any such impact
in this case could be offset by the fact that market players
regard Kan as someone who favours a weaker yen, he said.
 The Australian dollar, which has had a strong correlation
with Asian shares and the market's risk appetite in general,
dipped 0.5 percent to $0.8480, giving back some of its 1.5
percent climb the previous day, as Asian share prices fell.
 The Australian dollar rose and appetite for risk got a boost
in the previous session after the Reserve Bank of Australia gave
an upbeat assessment of the economic outlook for Asia and the
domestic economy.

 TOKYO, July 7 (Reuters) - The euro dipped on Wednesday but

 The euro slid beneath the cloud in mid-December, and had
mostly traded below it since then. But its rise back into the
cloud suggests the single-currency's downtrend on daily charts
may be over for now.
 ""The euro is in a retracement phase in the wake of its drop
to below $1.2 and could rise back towards the top of the cloud,""
said Tokichi Ito, deputy general manager for Trust & Custody
Services Bank's forex team.
 While worries about the euro zone's debt woes linger and
market players refrain from actively taking long positions in the
euro, Ito said the euro may see a short-covering bounce towards
$1.2800, near the top of the daily Ichimoku cloud.
 The euro was also supported after a strong response to a
syndicated Spanish debt sale. The robust demand eased some of the
worries about the debt problems in the euro zone, although
traders said they would remain cautious until the stress test
results of the euro zone's banks are out later this month.
 ""What we are seeing is some position adjustment which is
driving the euro,"" said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist
at ANZ. ""The common theme that is gaining ground in currency
markets is the U.S. dollar is being weighed down by soft U.S.
economic numbers.""
 The dollar index edged up 0.1 percent to 84.151, staying near
a two-month low of 83.825 hit this week. The dollar index lost
ground on Tuesday after a lacklustre report on business activity
in the U.S. service sector.
 The dollar held steady against the yen at 87.49 yen, not far
from a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit on EBS last week.
 The yen has made solid gains against the greenback in recent
sessions on the back of growing worries about an economic
slowdown in the United States and falling stock markets.
 Those concerns got a boost from a disappointing jobs report
from the U.S. late last week. That followed a raft of weak
reports which suggested consumer spending, housing and factory
activity were moderating.
 ""I think what we will see for a while is dollar selling,
coupled with bouts of backing off from risk-taking when there are
any sharp falls in equities,"" said Akira Hoshino, chief manager
for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ's foreign exchange trading
department.
 The yen is one currency that may benefit in this market
environment, Hoshino said.
 Market players said the yen took in stride a Kyodo news
agency poll showing that Japan's ruling Democratic Party could
win fewer than 50 seats in an upper house poll on Sunday,
a result that could put Prime Minister Naoto Kan's job on the
line and stall efforts to curb huge public debt.
 ""It is hard for the market to show a definite reaction,"" said
Osamu Takashima, chief fx strategist Japan for Citibank Japan.
 While a political crisis for the ruling party could be
regarded as a negative for a country's currency, any such impact
could be offset in this case by the fact that market players
regard Kan as someone who favours a weaker yen, he said.
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.3 percent to $0.8491, giving
back some of its 1.5 percent climb the previous day.
 The Australian dollar rose and appetite for risk got a boost
in the previous session after the Reserve Bank of Australia gave
an upbeat assessment of the economic outlook for Asia and the
domestic economy.

 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - World stocks posted their
biggest one-day gain in nearly a month on Tuesday after recent
drubbings pushed shares to attractive levels, while the euro
rose as investors waded back into risky assets.
 Gains were tempered late in the U.S. trading day, however,
as a slowdown in growth in the U.S. service sector weighed on
sentiment. Worries about the possibility of a double-dip
recession, which has been dogging financial markets,
persisted.
 Despite mixed reports, MSCI's all-country world stock index
<.MIWD00000PUS> jumped 1.6 percent, after last week plumbing
its lowest point since May 25.
 The euro rose against the dollar as risk appetite increased
after Australia's central bank gave an upbeat assessment for
Asia and for the Australian economy.
 But crude oil prices fell, unable to hold earlier advances,
after equities pared gains. And gold hit six-week lows after
the precious metal fell below key support of $1,200 an ounce.
 ""A lot of people got excited about how cheap things have
gotten,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush
Morgan in San Francisco.
 ""Absolutely nobody believes in the rally, at least the ones
we'll be seeing for now. The market sentiment is bearish and
there is no doubt that the economic recovery is slowing down.""
 The Institute for Supply Management, a U.S. business group,
said its index of non-manufacturing activity grew in June for a
sixth straight month, though the pace of expansion was its
slowest since February. Some analysts on Tuesday said the data
on the U.S. service sector, which dominates the U.S. economy,
did not suggest a double-dip recession was on the horizon.
 ""The change in direction is serious,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey. ""Statistics do not yet indicate a recession
but the mood is worrying.""
 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose
57.14 points, or 0.59 percent, to 9,743.62. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> gained 5.48 points, or 0.54 percent, to
1,028.06 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> edged higher by
2.09 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,093.88.
 The S&P fell every day last week and is down 8.3 percent
since December. Signs of weakness in the labor and housing
markets as well as a potential slowdown in manufacturing have
sparked worries.
 U.S. stocks on Tuesday were supported in anticipation of a
$22 billion initial public offering by the Agricultural Bank of
China. The IPO, which could set a world record, is seen as a
key test of investor sentiment.
 Comments from a member of the European Central Bank
Governing Council, Christian Noyer, relieved concerns about the
health of French banks. Noyer said the sector is likely to pass
Europe-wide stress tests later this month. For details, see

 U.S. and European banking shares were higher on Tuesday,
with financial stocks one of the best-performing sectors on the
S&P 500. Bank of America Corp  shares gained 1.6 percent
at $14.06 and the KBW bank index <.BKX> rose 1.2 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> closed up 2.6 percent at
991.23 points, bouncing back from six-week closing lows.
 French banks Societe Generale , Credit Agricole
 and BNP Paribas  jumped 4.2 to 6.3 percent.
 Mining stocks were also in demand. The STOXX Europe 600
Basic Materials <.SXPP> rose 5.1 percent after slipping on
Monday. The sector has been recently hammered by worries over
the pace of the global economy.
 Shares of BP  rose 3.7 percent as the company said it
had no plans to issue stock and talk persisted of sovereign
wealth fund interest in the British oil major.
 ""Markets are a bit oversold. The decline has been quite
strong,"" said Joost de Graaf, senior portfolio manager at
Kempen Capital Management in The Netherlands. ""There are hopes
that second-quarter earnings will be OK and will lift some of
the negative atmosphere.""
 The MSCI world index is still down almost 10 percent for
the year. World stocks weakened Monday. U.S. markets were
closed on Monday for the Independence Day holiday.
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up nearly 1 percent, coming
off a seven-week low. Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> jumped 2
percent.
 DOLLAR HIT
 The more risk-friendly mood hit the dollar, which fell
about two-third of a percent against a basket of major trading
partner currencies <.DXY>.
 The Australian dollar rallied after the Reserve Bank of
Australia's upbeat assessment of the global economy spurred
appetite for high-yielding currencies. The rising risk demand
also boosted the euro.
 Australia's central bank held its key interest rate at 4.5
percent. [ID:nSGE66508X]
 ""Although Australian monetary officials acknowledged the
fact that global growth was slowing, they nevertheless remained
positive regarding economic activity in the Asia Pacific,"" said
Boris Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT
Forex in New York.
 The euro  rose 0.65 percent at $1.2620. Against the
Japanese yen, the dollar  declined about a third of a
percent to 87.47 yen.
 While investors in most markets signaled rising risk
appetite, U.S. Treasury debt prices rose as traders added to
bets that the Federal Reserve will cling to an easy monetary
policy into the second half of 2011 in a bid to avert a
double-dip recession.
 In the wake of Friday's U.S. jobs report showing a payroll
loss for the first time this year, safe-haven appetite for
bonds persisted despite the stocks rebound on Wall Street.
 Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes declined
0.04 percentage point to 2.94 percent.
 In commodities, U.S. crude oil futures  fell 16
cents, or 0.2 percent, to settle down at $71.98. Spot gold
 fell $15.35, or 1.27 percent, to $1,192.60 an ounce.

 TORONTO, July 6 (Reuters) - Canada's dollar finished higher
against the U.S. currency on Tuesday, supported by rising risk
appetite around the globe, which helped boost equity markets
and some commodity prices.
 The currency drew early momentum from the price of oil, a
key Canadian export, which climbed toward $74 a barrel, and as
world stocks posted their biggest gains in a month after recent
drubbings brought in bargain-hunters. [O/R] [MKTS/GLOB]
 But the currency fell back from its intraday peak of
C$1.0486 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.37 U.S. cents, as oil prices
settled lower and U.S. equity markets lost steam on Tuesday
afternoon.
 Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital, said
a key catalyst behind the souring of investor sentiment was
data that showed the U.S. service sector expanded in June for a
sixth straight month, but the rate of growth slowed to the
lowest pace since February. [ID:nN06102990]
 ""It's another piece of data that speaks to the slowing in
growth momentum in the U.S.,"" said Tihanyi.
 U.S. stocks are typically seen as a barometer of investor
risk appetite and can influence the direction of Canada's
currency.
 The Canadian dollar  finished the session at
C$1.0557 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.72 U.S. cents, still
comfortably higher than Monday's finish at C$1.0650 to the U.S.
dollar, or 93.90 U.S. cents.
 Firas Askari, head of foreign exchange trading at BMO
Capital Markets, said technical factors also influenced the
Canadian dollar's ascent.
 ""When it couldn't break through the C$1.0680 area you saw
some people caught short the Canadian dollar. The fast money
turned themselves around and now they're running to catch up,""
he said.
 Askari said as Canadian currency gains, a key technical
level to watch for will be C$1.0472 to the U.S. dollar. If the
unit is able to pierce that level then the 200-day moving
average of C$1.0423 is the next target.
 BONDS MOSTLY FLAT
 Canadian government bonds were largely flat across the
curve as U.S. equity markets trimmed gains, said Sheldon Dong,
fixed income analyst at TD Waterhouse Private Investment.
 ""The big story was the fade in equity markets late in the
day,"" said Dong.
 ""The stock market opened up very strong so it was the
risk-on trade during the morning. Then when the equity markets
started to fade in the afternoon it was the risk-off trade.""
 The two-year government bond  was up 2 Canadian
cents to yield 1.419 percent, while the 10-year bond
 was unchanged to yield 3.081 percent.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2010 03:56PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Diplomacy dictates no label for China on currency," By Doug Palmer and Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON, July 6 (Reuters) - The Obama administration
likely won't risk a diplomatic spat with China by calling it a
currency manipulator in an overdue Treasury report, leaving it
to Congress to decide whether to get tough with Beijing.
 Analysts say politics, and a desire to not stop yuan reform
in its tracks, now drives the U.S. decision on whether China is
deliberately undervaluing the yuan.
 But even if the Senate presses forward with a vote on
legislation threatening China with duties on its exports,
President Barack Obama can count on the House of
Representatives to stop a bill from reaching his desk, analysts
said.
 U.S. law requires the Treasury Department to decide every
six months whether any country manipulates the value of its
currency to gain an unfair trade advantage, and many lawmakers
and economists believe that China is doing just that.
 The latest determination could come as soon as this week.
 Even with China's June 19 decision to end a peg between the
dollar and the yuan, U.S. trade groups say the Chinese currency
is 25 percent to 40 percent undervalued when compared with the
dollar. They claim that has give an edge to the Asian export
giant that has cost millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
 Following the pattern set by former President George W.
Bush, Obama has resisted formally labeling China a currency
manipulator while publicly pressing it to allow market forces a
greater role in setting the yuan's value.
 ""If you look at this report over the past six or seven
years -- in the period when concern about China's currency
practices was growing most quickly -- you can see that it is no
longer an economic analysis, it's a politically driven report,""
said Morris Goldstein, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute
for International Economics.
 The United States needs China's help on issues ranging from
North Korea to Iran. Calling Beijing a currency manipulator
could make it less likely to cooperate, even though that label
carries no immediate penalty.
 But the tensions over the yuan are part of broader dynamic,
with many U.S. companies frustrated over China's continued
failure to stop widespread piracy and counterfeiting of U.S.
goods while pursuing industrial policies that discriminate
against foreign suppliers.
 The latest Treasury report was due April 15, but Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner announced in early April he was
delaying it until after a summit of the Group of 20 leading
economic powers in late June to give China more time to act.
 One week before the G20 meeting, Beijing loosened the yuan
from its two-year-old peg to the dollar. Since then the yuan
has appreciated about 1.13 percent.
 Although that's much less than U.S. lawmakers want, Obama
is unlikely to rile Beijing by calling China a manipulator.
 ""It's not in the cards,"" said Goldstein. ""Treasury has been
pretty consistent in saying that it didn't want to go that way
in trying to influence China.""
 But with congressional elections fast approaching in
November and the U.S. trade deficit with China on track to
exceed $200 billion again this year, lawmakers may not be
content to let the matter end there.
 Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat, has repeatedly said he
wants a Senate vote on a bill threatening China with duties on
its exports if doesn't significantly raise the value of its
currency.
 ""Schumer's going to keep bothering people until he gets a
vote on this,"" said Bill Reinsch, president of the National
Foreign Trade Council, one of several U.S. business groups
opposed to the Schumer bill.
 ""It's a political year. He's running. (Senate Majority
Leader) Harry Reid's running. Everybody's running. And if
Schumer wants a vote on it, eventually I think they'll find a
way to give it to him,"" Reinsch said.
 But leaders in the House have more control over what
reaches the floor, he said.
 ""On a matter like this that's highly sensitive,"" said
Reinch. The House ""leadership is going to listen to what the
administration says"" and not allow a vote even in the likely
event the Senate passes a bill.
 Goldstein said he believed China would continue to give
just enough on the yuan to head off legislation.
 ""Congress is going to do a lot of huffing and puffing on
this but the signs are China sees Congress as a paper tiger on
this issue and has learned how to work Congress,"" he said.

 * Vote on Soskic expected to be a formality
 
 By Aleksandar Vasovic
 BELGRADE, July 6 (Reuters) - Serbian President Boris
Tadichas officially nominated Dejan Soskic, to be the new
central bank chief, months after the outgoing governor's
resignation, a statement said on Tuesday.
 ""President Tadic proposed to the parliament to appoint
Soskic as the new Governor of the National Bank of Serbia,"" said
a statement from Serbian president's office.
 Soskic's predecessor Radovan Jelasic resigned in March. The
parliament is expected to vote on Soskic's appointment to a
six-year term in office before the summer recess in August.
 A central bank insider who is currently holding the post of
the head of its Supervisory Board, Soskic (43) also lectures at
Belgrade University's Faculty of Economics.
 In an interview with Reuters in April, Soskic said he was
""neither"" hawk nor dove on the direction of interest rates.
 The central bank has cut its benchmark rate by a total of
almost 10 percentage points since January last year, with the
last cut in May to 8 percent.
 Tadic's nomination of Soskic came after Serbian parliament
last week adopted a new central bank which stipulates that an
Executive Board, comprising the governor and vice governors,
will decide on monetary policy and rates, handle the foreign
currency reserves and decide on exchange rate policy.
 Parliamentary approval of Soskic's nomination is expected to
be a formality as the ruling pro-European coalition of Tadic's
Democrats, the Socialist Party of Serbia and the G17 Plus party
already proposed him as the only candidate in April.
 Economists expect Soskic to tackle the slide of the dinar
which has weakened to around 104 per euro from around 76 when
the global financial crisis struck in 2008.
 In May the International Monetary Fund and Serbian
government downgraded forecast gross domestic product (GDP)
growth for 2010 to 1.5 percent from 2 percent after a 3 percent
contraction in 2009.

 By John Parry
 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Longtime technical analyst
Robert Prechter said on Tuesday he expects that as the U.S.
economy sinks into a deflationary depression stocks will
plunge.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> stock index could
fall to between about 1,000 and 3,000 points over the next five
to seven years, he said in a telephone interview. The Dow was
trading at 9,754 in early afternoon on Tuesday.
 ""It is very clear there is substantial stock market risk,""
said Prechter, who urges investors to put their money in cash
proxies such as safe-haven U.S. Treasury bills instead.
 Prechter is known for his very bearish views on the economy
and also for forecasting a big bull market in stocks in 1982
and for getting out before the 1987 market crash.
 Over the near term, the dollar will remain under pressure
against the euro and against the safe-haven Swiss franc, he
said.
 In early June, Prechter said the euro was about to embark
on a near-term rebound of about 10 percent over two or three
months because technical indicators showed that amid the euro
zone sovereign debt crisis, investors had become overly bearish
on that currency.
 Prechter reiterated that forecast on Tuesday, saying that
the euro will continue firming for about another two months,
until it has gained about 10 percent.
 In the past month, the euro  has gained about 6
percent against the dollar.
 But because Prechter expects that both the euro-zone and
the U.S. economies will experience deflation, he prefers
investing in the classic safe-haven currency, the Swiss franc.
 He forecast that the dollar could weaken to parity against
the Swiss franc over the next few months. On Tuesday, the
dollar was buying 1.0579 Swiss francs .
 ""If you are betting against the dollar, the Swiss franc is
a better place to go (than the euro),"" Prechter said.
 Recent data have shown the pace of U.S. economic growth is
decelerating, with housing turning especially weak.
 ""U.S. house prices are about half way down in their bear
market,"" said Prechter, adding that on aggregate, U.S. house
prices have fallen about 40 percent from the peak.
 Prechter, the president of research company Elliott Wave
International in Gainesville, Georgia, is also known for his
2002 book, ""Conquer the Crash,"" which warned about the huge
credit bubble that burst a few years later.
 As companies struggle in an economy that Prechter expects
to become increasingly gloomy, he expects junk bond yields to
continue widening over Treasuries.
 High-yield corporate bond spreads have widened to more than
700 basis points now from about 550 basis points in late April,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.
 ""We think we are back in a widening spread trend between
reliable debt and risky debt,"" he said. ""That's a safer bet
than forecasting interest rates per se,"" Prechter added.
 The bear market in crude oil, which started after prices
hit a record $147 per barrel in summer 2008, is not over,
Prechter said. Oil should fall below its December 2008 lows of
about $32 per barrel, he added.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was broadly
lower on Tuesday amid rising risk tolerance after the Reserve
Bank of Australia spurred traders' appetite for high-yielding
currencies such as the Australian dollar and the euro.
 A lackluster U.S. service sector report added to selling
pressure on the dollar on fears of further slowdown in the U.S.
economy.
 The RBA held its key interest rate at 4.5 percent, saying
policy was appropriate given caution in global markets even as
it remained optimistic about the outlook for Asia and the
domestic economy. For more, please see: [ID:nSGE66508X]
 While the RBA had been widely expected to keep rates on
hold, some investors had braced for a dovish statement after
recent signs that the Chinese economy may be slowing. 
 Analysts said relief over the RBA position calmed investors
and boosted global risk appetite, prompting an unwinding of
extreme short positions in currencies such as the euro. 
 ""Risk appetite staged a strong turnaround,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT Forex in
New York. ""Although Australian monetary officials acknowledged
the fact that global growth was slowing, they nevertheless
remained positive regarding economic activity in Asia
Pacific.""
 In midafternoon New York trade, the euro  rose 0.8
percent to $1.2643, breaking through option barriers at $1.26.
The euro also briefly hit a two-week high against sterling,
rising to as much as 83.41 pence .
 The Australian dollar  climbed 1.5 percent to $0.852,
pulling away from a session low of $0.8318.
 The dollar fell against the yen and the euro after the
Institute for Supply Management said its measure of the U.S.
non-manufacturing sector rose in June for a sixth straight
month, but the rate of growth was the slowest since February.
[ID:nN06274234]
 ""The slowdown in the U.S. economy is real, the change in
direction is serious,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market
analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey.
 ""Statistics do not yet indicate a recession, but the mood
is worrying. The dollar will continue to weaken,"" he said.
 The dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 87.48 yen .
 The euro also extended gains after the ISM report but
currency analysts warned that investors should be cautious on
the European currency.
 ""Interbank borrowing rates in the euro zone remain
elevated,"" said Brian Dolan at Forex.com.
 SWISS FRANC RISES
 The Swiss franc  rose as high as 1.0677 per dollar
according to Reuters data, its strongest since mid-April, only
to pull back to around 1.0580.
 It was hit by data showing Swiss CPI rose 0.5 percent in
June from a year ago, below the 1 percent rise analysts had
forecast. [ID:nZAT010924]. In June, the Swiss National Bank
backed off a pledge to fight franc appreciation, saying
deflation risks had faded.
 Tuesday's improvement in risk appetite followed weeks in
which it took a beating on growing worries about the health of
the euro zone's banking system, a slowdown in China and the
risk of a double-dip recession in the United States.
 ""Clearly, people are feeling a little better about the
world, but I am a pessimist,"" said Simon Derrick, head of
currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. ""China could see
a sharp slowdown toward the end of the year, which makes me
think the bullish story is not as positive as it might look.""

(Adds statement from U.S. wheat groups in paragraphs 13-14)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, July 6 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama wants
to win congressional approval of free trade deals with Panama
and Colombia but has not set a deadline for resolving problems
with the pacts, the top U.S. trade official said on Tuesday.
 ""These free trade agreements are almost entirely to the
benefit of American exporters and do represent collectively
several billion dollars of opportunities,"" U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk told reporters after a meeting of
Obama's Export Promotion Cabinet.
 ""We're going to do everything we can to bring them forward
as soon as it makes sense to do so,"" Kirk said.
 But there is no specific timetable for resolving labor and
other concerns with the agreements and sending them to Congress
for a vote, Kirk said.
 ""Hopefully we can come up with a more definitive timeline
on those in the near future as well,"" Kirk said.
 Last month at the Group of 20 summit in Toronto, President
Barack Obama said he wanted to fix problems blocking approval
of a free trade agreement with South Korea by November, when
Seoul will host the next G20 summit.
 Obama also said he planned to send the Korea agreement to
Congress for a vote by early 2011.
 Kirk explained that last month's meeting in Toronto was a
good time for Obama to announce a deadline for the South Korea
agreement because ""you had the practical circumstance of the
president being at the G-20 meeting with South Korean President
Lee (Myung-bak) and his pending visit in November, his state
visit as well as the G-20 visit.""
 ""As you know, we've always said that the substance of our
work with Panama and Colombia would drive those,"" Kirk added.
 Obama's decision to try to resolve beef and auto trade
issues blocking the Korea agreement has split Democrats ahead
of November congressional elections.
 While some like House of Representatives Majority Leader
Steny Hoyer have welcomed the move, others like Ohio Senator
Sherrod Brown have called it a mistake.
 All three agreements were negotiated by former President
George W. Bush's administration and have been sitting on
Obama's desk since he took office in January 2009.
 U.S. farm and business groups say the Canadian parliament's
recent ratification of a free trade pact with Colombia makes it
urgent the United States act soon.
 The Canada-Colombia free trade agreement ""means that U.S.
wheat producers could lose sales worth $70 million today to
Canada at a time when they can least afford it,"" the heads of
the U.S. Wheat Associates and the Natonal Association of Wheat
Growers said in a joint statement.
 Democratic opponents have been pushing Colombia to do more
to reduce killings of trade unionists and prosecute those
responsible for thousands of murders.
 They also want changes to Panama's labor and bank secrecy
laws and other reforms.

 * PM Radicova's cabinet to be sworn in on Thursday
 
 By Martin Santa
 BRATISLAVA, July 6 (Reuters) - Four Slovak centre-right
parties signed an agreement on a coalition on Tuesday that will
replace the centre-left cabinet of Robert Fico after winning a
June election on pledges to cut spending and fight corruption.
 Led by Iveta Radicova, the first woman to become prime
minister of the euro zone's poorest member, the parties plan to
balance Slovakia's budget. But she has voiced opposition to a
plan among the single currency's members to bail out Greece.
 Having secured 79 of parliament's 150 seats, Radicova's
conservative SDKU, the Christian Democrats, the liberal Freedom
and Solidarity party and the ethnic Hungarian Most-Hid ended
talks on Saturday, picking fiscal hawk Ivan Miklos as finance
minister.
 The new cabinet will be sworn in on Thursday after
parliament's inaugural session.
 ""We are ready to take responsibility over the country at a
time when it copes is coping with the impact of a deep economic
crisis and irresponsible decisions of our political
predecessors,"" Radicova said after the ceremonial signing of the
coalition agreement.
 The export-reliant, 63 billion euro economy is expected to
grow by more than 3 percent this year, after a 4.7 percent
contraction in 2009, but analysts say even strong growth will
provide only limited relief to weak budget revenue.
 Miklos, expected to take a hard line on the deficit after
earning a reputation as a market reformist when he held the post
from 2002 to 2006, will have to tackle a fiscal shortfall
expected to hit 7.0 percent of gross domestic product this year.
 The European Commission has asked Slovakia to cut the budget
deficit to below the prescribed level of 3 percent of GDP by
2013, and Miklos has pledged to balance state accounts in the
mid-term, although he has not given a date.
 The centre-right parties have not shed light on how fast
they plan to consolidate or when the EU's official fiscal limit
should be met, although they do not support tax hikes. 
 Miklos, however, is also strictly against a bilateral loan,
worth around 800 million euros, to debt-laden Greece, and
regards the 750-billion-euro European safety net as a bad idea.
 SDKU has said it would not block the agreement, but has not
yet made clear if and when the future government will sign it.

(Adds comments, details; updates prices)
 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar rallied
on Tuesday after an upbeat assessment of the global economy by
the Reserve Bank of Australia spurred traders' appetite for
high-yielding currencies, and the rising risk demand also
helped boost the euro.
 Higher risk appetite, combined with a lackluster U.S.
service sector report, put the dollar under broad selling
pressure amid fears of further slowdown in the U.S. economy.
 The RBA held its key interest rate at 4.5 percent on
Tuesday, saying policy was appropriate given caution in global
markets even as it remained optimistic about the outlook for
Asia and the domestic economy. [ID:nSGE66508X]
 While the RBA had been widely expected to keep rates on
hold, some investors had braced for a dovish statement after
recent signs that the Chinese economy may be slowing. 
 Analysts said relief over the RBA position calmed investors
and boosted global risk appetite, prompting an unwinding of
extreme short positions in currencies such as the euro.
 ""Risk appetite staged a strong turnaround,"" said Boris
Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT Forex in
New York. ""Although Australian monetary officials acknowledged
the fact that global growth was slowing, they nevertheless
remained positive regarding economic activity in Asia Pacific.""
 By late morning in New York, the Australian dollar 
had climbed more nearly 2 percent to $0.8543, pulling away from
a session low of $0.8318.
 The euro  rose 0.8 percent to $1.2649, poking through
option barriers at $1.26. The euro also briefly hit a two-week
high against sterling, rising to as much as 83.14
pence.
 In the United States, the dollar fell against the yen and
the euro after the Institute for Supply Management said its
measure of the U.S. non-manufacturing sector rose in June for a
sixth straight month, but the rate of growth was at the lowest
point since February. [ID:nN06274234]
 ""The slowdown in the U.S. economy is real, the change in
direction is serious,"" said Joseph Trevisani, chief market
analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey.
 ""Statistics do not yet indicate a recession, but the mood
is worrying. The dollar will continue to weaken,"" he said.
 The dollar was last down 0.4 percent at 87.39 yen 
from 87.79 yen prior to the ISM release. 
 The euro also extended gains after the ISM report but
currency analysts warned that investors should be cautious on
the European currency.
 ""Interbank borrowing rates in the euro zone remain
elevated,"" said Brian Dolan at Forex.com. 
 SWISS FRANC RISES
 The Swiss franc  rose to as high as 1.0666 per dollar
according to Reuters data, its strongest since mid-April, only
to pull back to around 1.0580.
 It was hit by data showing Swiss CPI rose 0.5 percent in
June from a year ago, below the 1 percent rise analysts had
forecast. [ID:nZAT010924]. The franc  was little
changed at 1.3370 per euro, down from the day's high of
1.3282.
 In June, the Swiss National Bank backed off a pledge to
fight franc appreciation, saying deflation risks had faded. 
 Tuesday's improvement in risk appetite followed weeks in
which it took a beating on growing worries about the health of
the euro zone's banking system, a slowdown in China and the
risk of a double-dip recession in the United States.
 ""Clearly, people are feeling a little better about the
world, but I am a pessimist,"" said Simon Derrick, head of
currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. ""China could see
a sharp slowdown toward the end of the year, which makes me
think the bullish story is not as positive as it might look.""

607,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2010 12:00PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Fitch raises Ukraine rating one notch to B," (Adds background, details, analyst quote)
 LONDON/NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Tuesday
raised its sovereign foreign currency credit rating on Ukraine
one notch to B from B-minus, citing the government's new loan
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 The ratings agency, which has a 'stable' outlook on Ukraine,
said the IMF pact will improve Kiev's financing flexibility and
unlock additional funding from other multilateral lenders.
 On Saturday, the IMF said it had agreed to recommend a loan
of $14.9 billion to Ukraine, in a deal aimed at helping the
country fill its budget gap while boosting investor confidence.
 ""The upgrade of Ukraine's sovereign ratings follows the
agreement on a new $14.9 billion IMF loan programme which
supports confidence in the policy and financing outlook, reduces
the risk of macroeconomic and financial instability and is
positive for the country's credit-worthiness,"" Fitch said in a
statement. 
 The IMF suspended Ukraine's $16.4 billion rescue programme
last year after the administration of former President Viktor
Yushchenko reneged on promises of financial restraint.
 ""Political stability is more assured now and this suggests a
better ability to deliver on the IMF programme,"" said Timothy
Ash, head of CEEMEA Research at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
 ""The economy should bounce back from a low base in 2010. The
current account deficit is modest while the debt amortisation
schedule is much lighter now...2011 could still be more
challenging,"" he added.
 The new agreement commits the ex-Soviet republic to cut its
budget deficit faster than it had planned, to 5.5 percent of
gross domestic product this year and 3.5 percent next year.
 ""Policies to meet these targets have yet to be detailed, but
are likely to include measures to improve tax collection and
raise domestic gas tariffs toward cost recovery levels,"" Fitch
said.
 ""However, a track record of policy consistency has yet to be
established in Ukraine,"" it added. 
 Fitch said the deal, due for approval by the IMF's board at
the end of July, is likely to accelerate recapitalisation of the
country's banking system, estimated by the ratings agency to
cost $11 billion in total.
Fitch's rating is still highly speculative but its upgrade
follows Standard & Poor's, which raised its rating on the
country to B in May. Moody's Investors Service has a B2 rating
on Ukraine.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - World stocks posted
their biggest gains in a month on Tuesday amid optimism thatEuropean banks would weather strength tests and on growth in
the U.S. service sector, while the U.S. dollar fell on a shift
to risky assets.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> jumped
2.2 percent, and U.S. markets advanced in anticipation of a $22
billion initial public offering by the Agricultural Bank of
China.
 The IPO, which could set an all-time record, is seen as a
key test of investor sentiment, compromised in recent weeks by
persistent fears the world's economic recovery is stalling.
 Relieving concerns about the health of French banks,
Christian Noyer, European Central Bank Governing Council
member, said the sector is likely to pass Europe-wide stress
tests later this month. His comments followed similar remarks
from the French economy minister. For details, see

 ""There appears to be a decent bounce here based on a couple
of risk-positive data points,"" said Craig Peckham, equity
trading strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York.
 Still, Peckham did not call an end to the selling that has
pummeled the S&P 500 index in the last two months.
 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> gained
132.41 points, or 1.37 percent, to 9,818.89. The Standard &

Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up nearly 1 percent, coming off a
seven-week low.
 Emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> jumped 2 percent.

strong,"" said Joost de Graaf, senior portfolio manager at
Kempen Capital Management in The Netherlands.
 ""There are (also) hopes that second-quarter earnings will
be OK and will lift some of the negative atmosphere.""
 The MSCI world index is still down nearly 10 percent for
the year. World stocks weakened Monday, though U.S. markets
were closed due to the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
 Investors have been concerned the global economic recovery
is slowing enough to send some countries into a double-dip
recession.
 The S&P 500 fell every day last week and has declined 8.3
percent since the beginning of the year. Signs of weakness in
the labor and housing markets as well as a potential slowdown
in manufacturing have sparked worries.
 On Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management, a U.S.
business group, said its index of non-manufacturing activity
grew in June for a sixth straight month but the rate of growth
slowed more than expected.
 A slew of brokerage upgrades helped U.S. shares. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc  rose 1.8 percent to $133.35, following
an upgrade to ""overweight"" by JPMorgan.
 DOLLAR HIT
 The more risk-friendly mood hit the dollar, which fell
nearly 1 percent against a basket of major trading partner
currencies. <.DXY>
 The Australian dollar rallied after the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) offered an upbeat assessment of the global

 The euro  rose 0.76 percent at $1.2634. Against the
Japanese yen, the dollar  declined 0.15 percent to

 Government bond demand softened against the rise in
equities. Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were
little changed at 2.98 percent.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 1.8
percent to $73.46 per barrel, while spot gold  fell 1.25

 By Elias Biryabarema and Sarah Young
 KAMPALA/LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Uganda on Tuesday gave
conditional approval for the sale of Heritage Oil's assets
there, paving the way for Tullow Oil to start a $10 billion
project to develop Uganda's oil reserves.
 Tullow and Heritage have been waiting since January for
Uganda's approval, which will see Tullow acquire Heritage's
stakes in two exploration blocks on the shores of Lake Albert.
 ""We have given Heritage and Tullow a conditional approval
for their transaction and the condition is...that the deal will
be fully endorsed after Heritage has deposited the 30 percent of
the capital gains tax with the Treasury,"" Energy Minister Hilary
Onek told reporters in Kampala.
 He said the remaining 70 percent would be given to the
government of Uganda via a bank guarantee which would be
redeemable upon completion of an arbitration process.
 The asset sale has been held up by wrangling over the
payment of capital gains tax. Onek said the full amount of
capital gains tax would amount to about $405 million.
""Heritage invested about $150 million in the fields and they
are going to earn a huge profit on Ugandan oil and we're saying
they have to pay a 30 percent tax on this profit...so we've
communicated this position,"" Onek said.
 Tullow offered last month to settle the dispute by
arbitration. Onek did not give any details on the terms of the
arbitration process.

 TOP 50 PRODUCER
 Once Tullow has acquired Heritage's stakes in the blocks for
up to $1.5 billion, it plans to bring in CNOOC of China and
France's Total to develop the oil fields in Uganda's Albertine
basin and turn the East African country into a top-50 oil
producer.
 Tullow said it would examine Uganda's terms.
 ""We have received a letter from the Ugandan government and
we will go and study it carefully and then see what we can do
from there,"" Hans Meijers, technical manager of Tullow Uganda,
told reporters in Kampala. 
 Tullow had expected Kampala also to approve CNOOC and Total
as partners at the meeting on Tuesday. However, Onek said
partnerships would only be considered after the arbitration
process is complete and the Tullow-Heritage deal fully endorsed.
 Ahead of the government's announcement, Tullow said
completion of the deal with Heritage would likely follow two to
three weeks after government approval was given. 
 ""Our tax situation is different because we're staying in the
country,"" Tullow's chief financial officer, Ian Springett, told
Reuters when asked if Tullow's sale of its interests to CNOOC
and Total would also be subject to tax in Uganda. 
 Springett said first oil from its closely watched Jubilee
field in Ghana -- one of the biggest oil finds in the world in
recent years -- was on schedule for November or December this
year and a vessel to facilitate production had arrived in Ghana.

agency on Tuesday criticised a group of 50 U.S. lawmakers for
calling for a probe into Chinese investment in the U.S. steel
sector, saying protectionism was rearing its ugly head again.
 The bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers pushed for an
investigation into whether the Chinese investment in the U.S.
steel sector should be blocked on national security grounds.
 The U.S. Congressional Steel Caucus, in a letter to
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, said it was ""deeply
concerned"" the recently announced joint venture between Anshan
Iron and Steel Group's and the Steel Development Co also
threatened American jobs.
 The Chinese state-owned firm, also known as Angang, plans
to invest in a $175 million rebar facility that Steel
Development is building in Amory, Mississippi. Rebar is a
reinforcing steel bar commonly used in concrete and masonry
structures.
 Xinhua said the production of rebar was hardly a secret and
that the project had no access to ""new steel production
technologies"".
 ""The tendency towards trade and investment protectionism is
rearing its ugly head again,"" Xinhua said in the
English-language article.
 ""It is common sense within the industry that nowadays,
steel trading is done through futures exchange or spots
markets, so the supply of rebar for certain 'national security
infrastructure projects' is irrelevant to producers,"" Xinhua
added.
 Such Chinese investments in the United States would help
address the very economic imbalances between the two sides many
U.S. politicians complain about, it said.
 ""It is known to all that Chinese companies' direct
investment in the United States is one solution to the
imbalance, but if the American side follows the logic of the
above-mentioned congressmen, it will only make things worse,""
Xinhua said.
 ""By root, the logic of those congressmen reflects the
over-sensitive psychology of certain U.S. politicians toward
China. It also signals their tendency toward protectionism.""
 The move comes at a time when U.S. steel companies have
complained loudly about unfair competition from China and have
won a number of U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duties on
Chinese steel goods.
 It also follows a high-level pledge by Geithner and senior
Chinese officials in late May that the United States and China
would remain open to each other's investments.
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang, who would not
comment directly on the steel case, said he hoped Chinese
companies investing in the United States would be treated
fairly.
 ""The Chinese government encourages Chinese firms to invest
in the United States and engage in cooperation there, and to
respect the law there. At the same time, we hope that ... the
U.S. market is open and that Chinese companies are fairly
treated,"" he said.
 The United States blocks few foreign investments.
 But last year, a Chinese mining company backed out of a
deal to invest in a Nevada gold mine after the CFIUS review
raised security concerns. The mine was about 100 km (60 miles)
from a base the U.S. Navy uses to train its pilots.
 China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) withdrew its bid
to buy Unocal Oil Co in 2005 after many U.S. lawmakers objected
on national security grounds.

 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar rallied
on Tuesday after an upbeat assessment of the global economy by
the Reserve Bank of Australia spurred appetite for
high-yielding currencies, while rising risk demand also helped
boost the euro.
 This put the dollar under broad selling pressure, pushing
it to a three-month trough versus the Swiss franc. The franc

against sterling, rising to as much as 83.11 pence earlier.
 The euro has struggled to make major gains above $1.2600,
however, with traders citing stop-loss orders above $1.2610.
The formation of an Ichimoku ""cloud"" technical pattern around
$1.2576 has also constrained the single currency.
 Ian Stannard, senior foreign exchange strategist at BNP
Paribas, said there was potential for the euro to gain broadly
and move toward a new target of 84 against sterling as he
expected a European Central Bank statement on Thursday to
comfort markets.
 He also said positive results from stress tests of euro
zone banks due later this month would boost euro.
 In the United States, markets awaited the ISM report on the
country's service sector in June.
 ""Although risk appetite has been positive in overnight
trade, if the ISM data misses its mark the flows could quickly
reverse as fresh fears emerge that the U.S. economy will face a
significant slowdown in the second half,"" said Schlossberg.
 SWISS FRANC RISES
 The Swiss franc rose to 1.0563 per dollar according to
Reuters data, its strongest since mid-April, only to pull back
to around 1.0625.
 It was hit by data showing Swiss CPI rose 0.5 percent in
June from a year ago, below the 1 percent rise analysts had

euro, down from the day's high of 1.3282.

 Tuesday's improvement in risk appetite followed weeks in
which it took a beating on growing worries about the health of
the euro zone's banking system, a slowdown in China and risks
of a double-dip recession in the United States.

 * Still considering pig feed additive ractopamine
 
 By Laura MacInnis
 GENEVA, July 6 (Reuters) - An international food safety body
set new rules on Tuesday on preparing bagged salads and said the
chemical melamine that tainted Chinese milk is acceptable only
in tiny amounts in infant formula and food.
 The Codex Alimentarius Commission decided at its meeting in
Geneva that animal manure should not be used to fertilise
lettuce and other fresh vegetables sold ""ready to eat"" to avoid
dangerous diseases.
 Contaminated water must also be kept away from bagged
produce that is not heat-treated, the Codex experts said, fixing
new benchmarks that could change production and harvesting norms
across the world.
 ""The problem is global,"" said Jorgen Schlundt, director of
food safety and zoonoses at the World Health Organisation, who
linked the use of animal manure in farming to disease outbreaks
in the United States and elsewhere.
 ""It makes sense in a number of different production systems
but when you are producing fresh salads that will be treated
without heat treatment there is a problem,"" he said.
 
 MINUTE LEVELS
 Codex, a joint venture of the World Health Organisation and
the Food and Agriculture Organisation,establishes food safety
rules for importers and exporters.
 In its discussion on melamine, the panel agreed that minute
levels of melamine, the chemical used in making plastics,
fertilisers and concrete, could be safe for human consumption,
and set upper limits of 1 mg per 1 kg of powdered infant formula
and 2.5 mg per 1 kg of other food and feeds.
 WHO food safety expert Angelika Tritscher said melamine can
be released in small quantities from a certain pesticide or when
food comes into contact with hard plastic dishes, table-tops or
some food processing machinery.
 The human body can tolerate this ""natural contamination"" of
melamine in small doses, unlike the intentional addition of the
compound to Chinese milk that killed at least six children in
2008 and made some 300,000 ill, she said.
 ""Intentional addition of melamine to food to fortify protein
content is by no means acceptable at any level,"" she said. ""The
purpose of these limits is to allow for the occurrence of
natural contamination through approved uses.""
 The 2008 melamine crisis damaged the reputation of China's
dairy industry and further sullied the made-in-China brand after
a string of health and product-safety scares. China executed two
people for their role in the scandal.
 Tritscher said the Codex panel had not yet agreed whether to
set a standard for ractopamine, a growth hormone added to pig
feed that China and the European Union have alleged is unsafe,
leading to a series of trade bans.
 The drug, which promotes muscle development for leaner meat,
is banned in the EU, and Brussels has banned imports of pork
from Brazil, which uses it. Taiwan and Thailand also ban
imported pork with residues of ractopamine.
 China has banned imports of pork from U.S. producers found
to contain residues of ractopamine. The United States has said
it ""strongly disagrees with China's assertions"" and called for
evidence to back up the ban.
 ""The discussions have been ongoing. It could still be made
this week,"" Tritscher said. The Codex meeting ends on Friday.
 A Codex ruling on ractopamine could set a benchmark for the
World Trade Organisation to use to review countries' adherence
to international trade agreements on food safety and sanitation,
and help it arbitrate trade disputes over the growth hormone.

 By Terhi Kinnunen
 HELSINKI, July 6 (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj is selling its
wireless modem business, as it drops non-core operations to
focus on its key phones unit that is under pressure from rivals
such as Apple
 Nokia, the world's top mobile phone maker, said on Tuesday
it is selling the wireless modem business to Japan's Renesas
Electronics for $200 million and the companies will form an
alliance to develop modem technologies.
 Finland-based Nokia issued a profit warning in June, its
second in less than two months, as it struggles to compete
against Apple's iPhone.
 Analysts said on Tuesday that Nokia's move to divest
non-core research and development was a continuation of its
earlier decisions to outsource component development.
 ""It is very logical that this is divested, they should have
done it a long time ago, because it hasn't really been core. And
I think they can do more of a similar type of agreement,"" said
analyst Martin Nilsson from Handelsbanken Capital Markets.
 Pohjola Bank analyst Hannu Rauhala said: ""This will decrease
somewhat Nokia's R&D costs.""
 Renesas Electronics, the world's fifth-largest chipmaker,
said the deal would allow it offer a one-stop mobile platform
that works with different types of wireless standards and help
it become one of the strongest chipmakers in the 3G and LTE
markets.
 The business to be transferred to Renesas Electronics
includes Nokia's wireless modem technologies for LTE, HSPA and
GSM standards, as well as some patents, Nokia said on Tuesday.
 About 1,100 Nokia R&D employees working in Finland, India,
Britain and Denmark will be transferred to the new owner in the
deal that is expected to complete in the fourth quarter.
 Renesas was created in April through a merger of Renesas
Technology and NEC Electronics, two loss-making Japanese
semiconductor companies hit hard by the global economic
downturn.
 It is the world's No. 1 microcontroller maker ahead of
Freescale Semiconductor, and is aiming to expand its operations,
including its mobile business, overseas.
 A Renesas spokeswoman said that after the acquisition the
firm would aim to double its mobile device business sales to 200
billion yen ($2.3 billion) by March 2013 and quadruple it to 400
billion yen by March 2016.
 Nokia shares were up 2.6 percent up at 6.795 euros by 1102
GMT compared with a 2.4 percent higher STOXX Europe 600
Technology Index.

 * Business group official sees decline in Iran businesses
 * Chamber of Commerce expects bilateral trade to be hit
(Adds Iran-UAE chamber of commerce, paragraphs 3, 18)
 By Fredrik Dahl
 DUBAI, July 6 (Reuters) - New sanctions on Iran are expected
to complicate life further for Iranian businesses based in the
United Arab Emirates, home to the regional trade hub Dubai, and
may force some to close down, one of their representatives said.
 Morteza Masoumzadeh, vice president of the local Iranian
Business Council, also told Reuters he believed the UAE
authorities would impose more restrictions after the latest wave
of international punitive measures against Iran.
 In Tehran, the head of an Iran-Emirates Chamber of Commerce
said the UAE had taken steps beyond last month's United Nations
resolution and predicted bilateral trade would fall.
 Thousands of Iranian companies and businessmen operate in
Dubai, and many of them are involved in the multi-billion-dollar
re-export trade with the Islamic Republic across the Gulf.
 But the UAE, a U.S. ally, has signalled a tightening of its
role as a trading and financial lifeline for Iran after the U.N.
Security Council imposed a fourth round of sanctions on June 9
on the major oil producer over its disputed nuclear programme.
 ""I predict a further decline in Iranian businesses in the
UAE and other countries doing direct trade with Iran, like
Turkey, Malaysia etc,"" said Masoumzadeh.
 ""This will make it even much worse than before, there is no
question about it,"" he said on Monday, when asked about the
impact of the new sanctions on Iranian businesses in the UAE.
 His comments were in contrast to statements by Iranian
officials in Tehran dismissing the latest measures. President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called them ""pathetic"".
 
 IRAN TRADE
 Previous sanctions have hurt Iranian business activities by
making it more difficult to get vital trade finance, such as
letters of credit, after the United States targeted two Iranian
state banks with branches in Dubai three years ago .
 The latest U.N. resolution calls for measures against new
Iranian banks abroad if a connection to the nuclear or missile
programmes is suspected, as well as vigilance over transactions
with any Iranian bank, including the central bank.
 ""I'm sure that from now on ... trade transactions in foreign
currencies such as the euro and (UAE) dirhams will become more
difficult,"" said Masoumzadeh, who rejects any idea that Dubai is
a centre for illicit trade with Iran.
 U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law sanctions on
Iran's vulnerable petrol imports last week, further stepping up
pressure over nuclear work which the West suspects is aimed at
making bombs -- something Tehran denies.
 Iranian aviation officials accused the UAE, Germany and
Britain on Monday of refusing to refuel Iranian passenger planes
in response to the tougher U.S. measures, but this was later
denied by the country's Foreign Ministry. Iran and the UAE
have close economic and historic relations but with Tehran
facing growing Western pressure, its ties with Dubai have drawn
scrutiny from Washington.
 In 2009, Dubai's re-exports to Iran -- goods originally from
Europe, Asia or elsewhere and then sold on to Iran -- rose 4.8
percent to 21.3 billion dirhams ($5.8 billion).
 In a possible sign of tougher times ahead, an Abu Dhabi
banking source said last week the UAE's central bank had told
banks to freeze any accounts belonging to dozens of Iran-linked
firms targeted by the latest U.N. sanctions.
 ""I have no doubt that more restrictions will be applied
towards Iranian businesses by the UAE authorities,"" said
Masoumzadeh, who has a Dubai-based shipping business.
 Masoud Daneshmand, the Iran-Emirates Chamber of Commerce
head, said Iranian businessmen were unhappy about the UAE's
actions, Iran's ISNA news agency reported. ""Trade between Iran
and the Emirates will be reduced in coming months,"" he said.

 * Finmin warns of growing external uncertainties
(Recast with IMF forecasts)
 By Cheon Jong-woo and Kim Yeon-hee
 SEOUL, July 6 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund
said on Tuesday the time is right for South Korea to start
raising interest rates as it sharply raised the country's
economic growth forecast for this year.
 The IMF upgraded its growth forecast for Asia's
fourth-largest economy to 5.75 percent from 4.5 percent,
citing
supportive macroeconomic and financial policies and a recovery
in global trade.
 ""It is now appropriate for the Bank of Korea to start
gradually raising the monetary policy rate to avoid falling
behind curve,"" it said in a statement.
 ""Beginning to raise the policy rate would still leave
monetary policy highly supportive of the recovery that is being
anticipated in the baseline.""
 The statement, released after market hours, come ahead of
the Bank of Korea's monthly rate review on Friday, when some
analysts expect the central bank to deliver its first rate
increase since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.
 Bank of Korea kept the benchmark rate steady in June at a
record low of 2.0 percent for the 16th consecutive month after
delivering a total of 325 basis points of cuts during the
downturn.
 Subir Lall, the head of IMF's Asia-Pacific department, told
Reuters in an interview that South Korea's ""neutral"" policy
interest rate was around 4 percent.
 South Korea has already started to withdraw some of the
measures put in place during the crisis, such as not extending
a debt payment guarantee and terminiating an emergency currency
swap agreements with the United States.
 STRONG H2 OUTLOOK
 The world's ninth-biggest exporter posted a record trade
surplus in June, powered by brisk shipments of electronics
goods and cars, data showed last week.
 The Finance Ministry lifted its growth forecasts for 2010
last month and announced a gradual return of economic policy to
pre-crisis settings, reinforcing investors' bets that interest
rates will start rising soon.
 But the finance ministry on Tuesday warned of growing
external uncertainties and said it would strengthen monitoring
of global developments.
 ""Although our economy is maintaining a recovery trend...
concerns about global economic recovery have been mounting,""
the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said in its monthly Green
Book report of preliminary economic indicators.
 In June, investment in plants and equipment was expected to
have expanded and the current account surplus rose to an
estimated $5.5 billion, against May's $3.83 billion before
seasonal considerations, the Green Book report added.
 Department sales rose 10.8 percent in June over a year
earlier, compared with 7.5 percent in May, the ministry said.
 Meanwhile, Lall said the IMF backed the country's recent
measures to curb rapid shifts in capital flows that were linked
to short-term foreign debt and posed a risk to the world's
ninth-biggest exporter.
 ""We support the macro prudential measures that can make
banks even more stronger against changes in global
deleveraging,"" he said.

 PARIS, July 6 (Reuters) - Rebalancing the global economy and
establishing new financial regulations should be done gradually
so as not to harm the economic recovery, ECB Governing Council
member Christian Noyer said on Tuesday.
 ""The challenge is to calibrate and phase in the new
framework in a way that does not impede the recovery and does
not contradict our macroeconomic objectives,"" Noyer told the
Europlace Financial Forum in Paris. 
 ""If the rebalancing happens too fast, it might weaken the
recovery, but if reforms are delayed too much, the longer-run
growth prospects will be affected negatively.""
 Noyer said countries facing serious fiscal challenges should
speed up the pace of fiscal consolidation, while those that had
capacity should expand domestic sources of growth to help
cushion the impact of a fall in demand from other countries.
 Policymakers in Europe see the key to overcoming the euro
zone crisis and restoring confidence mostly in strengthening and
widening Europe's fiscal rules and economic surveillance.
 Noyer said on Tuesday that regulation should become ""truly
global"" given the more internationally linked financial markets,
adding that the crisis had exposed ""black holes"" and the
""shadowy banking system.""
 He said reforms for over-the-counter derivatives would be
essential to address accumulated market risks, while policy
options could also entail exchange rate adjustments.
 ""The presence of high and persistent imbalances in the
global economy is a real issue,"" he said. ""This does not mean of
course that one should expect countries to run balanced current
account positions at all times.""

the conversion rate of Swiss franc mortgages at 205 forints per
franc for the next three months to protect borrowers from market
volatility, the bank said on Tuesday.
 The bank said the preferential conversion rate, effective
from July 6, would be available to borrowers not running late on
repayments and if the forint firmed below 205 per franc the bank
would automatically calculate instalments at the lower rate.
 However, FHB said the cheaper rate would be suspended if the
central bank's average exchange rate exceeds 215 forints per
Swiss franc on average in the preceding 30 days.
 The announcement comes after Hungary's biggest bank, OTP,
decided to cut interest rates on Swiss franc and Japanese
yen-denominated loans as of June to reduce monthly repayments
boosted by a weak forint.
 Swiss franc loans make up about 44 percent of Hungary's
entire household debt stock -- and 55 percent of all mortgages -
and the franc is now trading near record levels at 213 versus
the forint, far above 150-160 where most loans were issued.
 Hungary's new centre-right government, which wants to launch
a mortgage relief fund next year using bank capital and state
guarantees to help troubled borrowers, has proposed to ban new
mortgage lending in foreign currencies to mitigate risks.
 The new head of financial market regulator PSZAF told
Reuters on Monday the authority would propose legislation that
would lower the conversion costs of foreign currency for
hundreds of thousands of borrowers.
 At 0858 GMT, FHB shares traded 9.4 percent higher at 1,132

 By Naomi Tajitsu and Lin Noueihed
 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar rallied on
Tuesday after an upbeat assessment of the global economy by the
Reserve Bank of Australia, which stoked short-covering demand
for higher-risk currencies, including the euro.
 This put the dollar under broad selling pressure, pushing it
to a three-month trough versus the Swiss franc. But the franc
itself later came under pressure after weak Swiss consumer price
data tempered the view deflation risks have receded.
 The RBA held its key interest rate at 4.5 percent on
Tuesday, saying policy was appropriate given caution in global
markets even as it remained optimistic about its outlook for
Asia and the domestic economy.
 While the RBA had been widely expected to keep rates on
hold, some market participants had been bracing for a very
dovish statement after recent signs that the Chinese economy may
be slowing.
 Analysts said relief that the RBA was refusing to panic
about the possibility of a global slowdown was helping to calm
investors, prompting unwinding of extreme short positions in
currencies including the euro.
 ""The RBA statement showed no sign of the fears priced in by
the market. It was a balanced statement,"" said Elsa Lignos,
currency strategist at RBC.
 ""It is now very unlikely that we will see more cuts this
year and in fact there could be hikes.""
 She added that the Aussie's climb against the dollar was
largely a proxy for improving risk demand.
 By 0821 GMT, the Australian dollar had climbed 1 percent on
the day to $0.8499, pulling away from a session low of $0.8317.
It rose 1 percent to 74.43 yen.
 ""Risky assets are performing well, there's been a gradual
return of risk appetite,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency
strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, adding that a 1.6
percent rise in European shares was boosting the Aussie.
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2602, poking through option
barriers at $1.26. Still, the euro's gains were capped, with
traders citing big stop-loss orders looming around $1.2610.
 
 SWISSIE HIT BY DATA
 The Swiss franc rose to 1.0563 per dollar in early European
trade, according to Reuters data, its strongest since mid-April,
only to pull back to around 1.0612.
 The franc was hit by data showing Swiss CPI rose 0.5 percent
in June from a year ago but were 0.4 percent lower compared with
the previous month. Forecasts were for a 1.0 percent
year-on-year rise and flat monthly reading.
 The Swiss franc was slightly lower on the day against the
euro at 1.3365 per euro, relinquishing gains after climbing as
high as 1.3282 in earlier trade.
 Global risk appetite was improving on Tuesday, having taken
a beating in the past few weeks on growing worries about the
health of the euro zone's banking system, a slowdown in China
and risks of a double-dip recession in the United States.
 But caution about the health of the global recovery remains,
as highlighted by Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff. 
 The former International Monetary Fund chief economist and
an expert on banking crises told Bloomberg Television China's
property market was beginning a ""collapse"" that would hit banks.

 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - World stocks bounced higher on
Tuesday from a recent five-week low in a broad risk rally that
boosted oil prices, while investors sold off the dollar and
government bonds.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up

 The MSCI world index is still down more than 10 percent so

 Investors have been beset by concern that the global
economic recovery is slowing enough to send some countries into
a double-dip recession.
 This is combined with nagging fears that the recovery seen
so far is all down to government action, which may soon end.

 * When: Thursday, July 8 at 1100 GMT
 * UK rates seen on hold as Budget clouds growth prospects
 * Sentance likely to remain alone with rate hike call
 By David Milliken
 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - The Bank of England is almost
certain to leave interest rates at 0.5 percent on Thursday, with
few policymakers tempted to join last month's rate-rise advocate
Andrew Sentance given the threat to sustained economic recovery.
 None of the 61 economists polled by Reuters last week
expected the central bank to change policy as the scale of
budget cuts in the new government's June budget and similar
measures in other parts of Europe increase the risk of sluggish
growth next year.
 The British Chambers of Commerce warned on Tuesday that the
0.6-0.7 percent growth it believes occurred over the past three
months may mark a high point in Britain's recovery, and that the
spending cuts and tax rises in the Budget risk tipping Britain
back into recession [ID:nLDE66416A]
 Consumer price inflation at 3.4 percent is still well above
the BoE's 2 percent target, but has fallen from May's 17-month
peak of 3.7 percent in what the central bank expects to be the
start of a fairly steady downward path.
 BoE Governor Mervyn King and most other members of the
Monetary Policy Committee have seemed confident that CPI will
fall back to target of its own accord, once past rises in
value-added tax and import prices drop out of the annual data.
 ""Most members also seem reassured by the fact that the
recent high rates of inflation have not been accompanied by ...
any of the traits that would ordinarily be associated with a
continuous rise in prices,"" said Vicky Redwood of Capital
Economics.
 ""Growth of overall broad money, pay and nominal spending are
all relatively low,"" she said.
 Nonetheless, policymakers are not totally relaxed about
higher inflation. Adam Posen said last week public inflation
expectations were edging up -- though not by enough for him to
discount the countervailing risk of recession [ID:nLDE65T0KR].
 And minutes of June's MPC meeting noted that a group of
policymakers other than Sentance had doubts about how much of a
downward impact on inflation economic spare capacity will have
[ID:nLDE65M0SE].
 
 THREE CAMPS?
 There are signs that MPC is fragmenting into three camps.
King and Sentance appear to be at different ends of the spectrum
regarding the ability of CPI to return to target of its own
accord, and a group in the middle with varied views on the
stickiness of Britain's consumer prices [ID:nLDE6610GG].
 However, observers will have to wait until policy minutes
are published on July 21 before they can see if Sentance has
convinced any of his colleagues to raise rates.
 One element of uncertainty stopping the BoE from changing
course -- the scale of cuts in finance minister George Osborne's
budget -- has been resolved since June's meeting. 
 But any policymakers edging towards Sentance's view are
still more likely to wait until August's new set of quarterly
central bank growth and inflation forecasts before breaking
cover, as these figures have been the driving force behind most
of the MPC's big decisions over the past two years.
 ""Most members still seem prepared to wait and see if the
spare capacity in the economy starts to pull inflation back
down,"" said Redwood. ""We doubt that a rate hike is imminent and
in fact think that the magnitude of the fiscal squeeze makes a
further extension of quantitative easing likely.""
 It is six months since the BoE last bought government bonds
with newly-created money, in what was part of an 11-month
campaign to bolster the money supply by 200 billion pounds ($302
billion) and stave off deflation.

 * Euro also turns positive, dollar, yen retreat
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 6 (Reuters) - The euro and Australian dollar
rebounded from early losses against the dollar and yen on Tuesday
after a statement by Australia's central bank helped dispel some
gloom about the economic outlook and led to short-covering.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left its cash rate steady
at 4.5 percent as expected, saying the global economy had
continued to expand, albeit unevenly, with growth in Asia very
strong and signs of China moderating to a more sustainable rate.
 The Aussie fell in thin trading ahead of the announcement as
some had expected it to sound a more dovish note, and on the
charts it formed a short-term double bottom at $0.8317, a drop
which helped set it up technically for a rebound.
 ""There were concerns among dealers that the RBA would be very
bearish about the economy before the rate announcement. But the
central bank was not that dovish, prompting players to buy back
the Australian dollar, as well as the euro,"" Daisuke Karakama,
market economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 ""But there were no new factors out. The only thing we can say
is that the euro and the Aussie are in a rebound phase.""
 The Aussie stood 0.4 percent up on the day at $0.8437 after
earlier dropping to test support at $0.8315, a low set last week.
 Against the yen it climbed 0.6 percent on the day at 74.08
yen after sliding as far as 72.73 yen.
 ""The RBA is refusing to panic, as many in the market seem to
be,"" said Brian Redican, senior economist at Macquarie.
 Some analysts said another rate hike in August could not be
ruled out but a rate cut, as some had started to talk about,
looked unlikely.
 ""Yes, global uncertainties are to the downside, so that
raises the bar for a hike. But the RBA is still sounding
confident and there's very little chance of a cut,"" Redican said.
 Global risk appetite has taken a beating in the past few
weeks on growing worries about the health of the euro zone's
banking system, a slowdown in China and risks of a double-dip
recession in the United States.
 The euro, which dipped to $1.2479 in early trade, pulled back
up to $1.2557, heading back towards last week's six-week high at
$1.2613.
 Against the yen it also turned positive at 110.28 yen after
dipping as far as 109.14 early on.
 The early losses came after Harvard University economist
Kenneth Rogoff, a former International Monetary Fund chief
economist and an expert on banking crisis, told Bloomberg
Television that China's property market is beginning a ""collapse""
that would hit banks.
 The report fed into concerns about China's economy, while
speculative trades exaggerated yen gains in subdued activity as
the market awaited the return of U.S. players from a long
weekend.
 U.S. markets were closed for the Independence day holiday on
Monday.
 Data from Japan's finance ministry showed China expanded its
buying of Japanese government bonds in the first four months this
year, buying a net 541 billion yen of mostly short-term JGBs,
double a record amount logged in 2005, amid the euro zone debt
crisis.
 JGB market players said the buying was probably more about
parking funds short-term during the euro zone debt crisis than
long-term interest.
The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance
against a basket of six major currencies, slid 0.2 percent to
84.427. The index's near-term support is seen at 84.132, a
seven-week low hit last week.
 The dollar was steady at 87.75 with the market watching
whether it could hold above 87.00 yen as options triggers are
believed to be set below that level, traders said.
 The greenback hit a seven-month trough of 86.96 yen last week
on the back of growing worries about an economic slowdown in the
United States.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2010 02:32AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China's FX reserve managers defend their record," * China's FX reserve managers seek to disarm critics
 * Big losses avoided during global crisis
 * Europe to remain key investment target
 BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - The managers of China's hoard of
currency reserves defended their investment record on Tuesday,
saying they had avoided big losses during the global crisis and
voicing confidence they could achieve stable long-term returns.
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange is an easy
target for domestic critics who question why China has amassed
$2.45 trillion in reserves and invested the money largely in U.S.
and European bonds instead of spending it at home.
 In a detailed statement apparently aimed at deflecting such
criticism, SAFE said it had realised ""relatively good returns"" in
2008 and 2009 when the international financial crisis was raging.
 ""In any specific year, the investment return on our foreign
exchange reserves may not be very high, but we are confident of
achieving good, stable returns in the long term,"" it said.
 Worries this year have centred on Europe after Greece's
failure to roll over its bonds prompted euro zone governments and
the IMF to sling a safety net under the entire bloc in case of a
fresh market emergency.
 SAFE said the measures had worked so far in staving off debt
defaults or restructuring and Europe would remain a key
investment market for China's reserve managers.
 ""We believe Europe, with the joint efforts of the
international community, will overcome its difficulties and
maintain financial market stability and healthy development,""
SAFE said.
 The agency's statement was the second in a series setting out
how it works. Last week SAFE explained to the public why the
reserves, built up by selling yuan to hold down the currency's
value, cannot be spent freely inside China.
 One of the prime concerns of Internet commentators is the
long-run health of the dollar. If the U.S. currency weakens,
SAFE's vast holdings of U.S. securities, mainly bonds, will be
worth less when translated back into yuan.
 Bankers assume that perhaps two-thirds of China's reserves,
by far the world's largest stockpile, is parked in dollar assets,
although the currency composition is a state secret.
 But SAFE explained that any currency translation losses are
only on paper and would not be realised unless the central bank
were to sell its reserves -- something that it said was
impossible to imagine unless there was a war or a huge crisis.
 What's more, if the yuan appreciates, currency translation
losses will be outweighed by book gains from rising asset prices,
the agency said on its website, www.safe.gov.cn.
 SAFE also took head-on worries voiced in Internet forums
about China's investments in the U.S. mortgage financing agencies
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Washington had to make good on its implicit backing for the
two government-sponsored entities during the sub-prime debt
crisis by bailing them out.
 SAFE had not bought shares of Fannie and Freddie, and the
delisting of the agencies' shares had not affected the value of
their bonds, which are a favourite with central bank reserve
managers.
 ""At present, principal and interest payments on Fannie and
Freddie bonds are normal, and the prices of the bonds are stable.
 ""We will continue to closely follow relevant developments at
Fannie and Freddie to ensure the safety of our foreign exchange
reserve assets,"" the statement said.

 By Wayne Cole
 SYDNEY, July 6 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held
its key cash rate steady for a second month on Tuesday, saying
policy was appropriate given caution in global markets even as
it remained upbeat on the outlook for Asia and the domestic
economy.
 The Australian dollar jumped as the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) played down some of market's concerns about
China, instead highlighting Australia's booming terms of trade
and the risk of higher inflation at home.
 Investors had seen no prospect of another rate hike at the
central bank's July policy meeting and even a slim chance of a
cut given fears over the euro zone and a global slowdown.
 ""The RBA is refusing to panic, as many in the market seem
to be,"" said Brian Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie.
 ""They see global growth at trend; domestic growth at trend;
a strong labour market and inflation in the top end of their
target band. That doesn't sound like a recipe for a rate cut to
me.""
 Interbank futures duly pared the probability of an easing
in the 4.5 percent cash rate in the next few months, but still
imply no chance at all of a hike for a year or so.
 ""Pending further information about international and local
conditions for demand and prices, the Board views this setting
of monetary policy as appropriate,"" wrote RBA Governor Glenn
Stevens in a brief policy statement.
 The central bank raised rates by 150 basis points between
October and May, putting Australia light years ahead of other
rich nations in withdrawing emergency policy stimulus.
 Reuters Insider show on the Australian dollar's reaction
 http://link.reuters.com/cuh75m
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 The next key test for policy will be the consumer price
report for the second quarter due on July 28, where a high
reading on inflation could add to pressure for a rate rise.
 ""Even if there is an upside surprise there, the RBA will be
mindful of the global growth picture,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a
senior economist at RBC Capital Markets. ""I think they are in
wait and watch mode and will take it from month to month from
here.""
 COUNTING ON TRADE
 The RBA has been resolutely upbeat on the outlook thanks to
rapid population growth, a stable banking system and strong
Asian demand for Australia's commodity exports.
 Stevens noted that while activity in the major advanced
countries had been modest overall, growth in Asia and Latin
America was very strong.
 Recently some investors have become more anxious that
China's efforts to cool its housing market could slow the whole
economy, and thus temper demand for resources.
 Yet Stevens saw Chinese growth merely moderating to a ""more
sustainable rate"" and noted the commodity prices most important
for Australia remained at very high levels.
 The RBA's own measure of commodity prices climbed to a
20-month high in June, to be up 47 percent from lows touched in
May last year and not far from record territory.
 All of which was positive for Australia's terms of trade -
what it gets for exports compared to what it pays for imports.
They are expected to surge over 20 percent this year thanks to
booming coal and iron ore prices.
 Figures out on Tuesday showed the country's trade surplus
swelled to the third highest on record in May as exports of
gold, wheat and coal all surged.
 That in turn will shower money on the economy via higher
profits, investment, wages and tax receipts. The Labor
government has already made a grab for some of the windfall
with a proposed new tax on booming coal and iron ore profits.
 ""With the high level of the terms of trade expected to add
to incomes and demand, output growth in Australia over the year
ahead is likely to be about trend,"" wrote Stevens. Trend growth
is generally seen at around 3.25 to 3.5 percent a year.
 The attraction of Australian commodities to foreign firms
was also evident in a burst of takeover activity this week.
 Thailand's Banpu bid $2 billion for Centennial Coal while
Singapore's Wilmar International offered $1.5 billion to buy
the sugar business of CSR.

 * Japan coincident indicator falls first time in 14 months
(Adds details, direct quote)
 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, July 6 (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers said on
Tuesday they were closely watching falling share prices and
recent rises in yen, which are clouding the outlook for the
export-reliant economy's fragile recovery.
 National Strategy Minister Satoshi Arai, who is also
economics minister, said financial markets were reacting to signs
that a recovery in the U.S. economy is not as strong as some had
anticipated.
 Though he said the market turmoil so far has had little
impact on Japan's gradual recovery from recession that started
last year, analysts worry that further gains in the yen could
dampen business sentiment and slow corporate capital spending.
 Japan's coincident indicator of economic activity fell in May
for the first time in more than a year, data showed on Tuesday,
highlighting economists' forecasts that growth is likely to slow
this year as a recovery in exports moderates.
 ""We need to closely watch whether stock declines and yen
gains will continue,"" Arai told a news conference.
 ""Market moves don't change the recovery trend for Japan's
economy. I don't take declines in global stocks as a sign that
the economic trend is changing.""
 Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda also said on Tuesday he is
closely monitoring moves in the share and currency markets.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan is trying to convince voters before
an election for parliament's upper house on Sunday that his
ruling Democratic Party can spur growth while also repairing the
country's tattered public finances with higher taxes.
 The yen has made solid gains against the greenback in recent
days on the back of growing worries about the U.S. economy. The
dollar was around 87.50 yen, not far from a seven-month low of
86.94 yen struck on July 1.
 The Nikkei slumped to a seven-month low on Tuesday after
European shares closed at their lowest level in nearly six weeks
as weak data on Chinese manufacturing and the U.S. labour market
weighed on investor sentiment. Wall Street was closed on Monday
for a public holiday.
 Japan's coincident index of economic indicators fell 0.1
point in May from April, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday, for
the first decline in 14 months.
 The index of leading economic indicators, which is compiled
using data such as the number of job offers and consumer
sentiment and is a gauge of the economy a few months ahead, fell
3.0 points from April, the second consecutive month of decline.
 ""The impact on the markets from Europe and the waning affect
of government stimulus is a source of some uncertainty,"" Keisuke
Tsumura, a parliamentary secretary of the Cabinet Office, told
reporters at a briefing.
 ""However, these factors are not having a direct impact on the
prospects for a sustainable recovery in Japan.""

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 6 (Reuters) - The dollar and the yen gained in
thin trade as investors reduced risk positions on Tuesday, while
the Australian dollar fell ahead of a central bank decision where
it is widely expected to be keep interest rates steady.
 Global risk appetite has taken a beating in the past few
weeks on growing worries about the health of the euro zone's
banking system, a slowdown in China and risks of a double-dip
recession in the United States.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback against a basket of six major currencies, edged up 0.1
percent to 84.68. The index's near-term support is seen at
84.132, a seven-week low hit last week.
 The safe-haven yen rose broadly after Harvard University
economist Kenneth Rogoff, a former International Monetary Fund
chief economist and an expert on banking crisis, told Bloomberg
Television that China's property market is beginning a ""collapse""
that would hit banks.
 Market players were watching whether the dollar could hold
above 87.00 yen as options triggers are believed to be set below
that level, traders said. The greenback hit a seven-month trough
of 86.96 yen last week on the back of growing worries about an
economic slowdown in the United States.
 ""Market participants have become very bearish on everything
against the yen and I am not sure why they have to be so
pessimistic,"" said a trader at a major Japanese brokerage.
 Those concerns got fuel from a disappointing U.S. jobs report
last week which showed the economy shed 125,000 jobs in June.
 The trader said speculative trades exaggerated a fall in the
cross/yen rates in subdued activity on Tuesday, as many investors
were waiting for U.S. players to return from a three-day weekend.
 U.S. markets were closed for the Independence day holiday on
Monday.
 The dollar inched down to 87.53 from around 87.75 yen in the
previous day's late London trade.
 In Asian trade, the euro fell as low as 109.14 yen, finding
support at 109.13 yen, the June 30 high.
 The yen was further helped by a Nikkei business daily report
which said China had expanded its buying of Japanese government
bonds in the first four months this year, snapping up a net 541
billion yen of mostly short-term JGBs, double a record amount
logged in 2005, amid the euro zone debt crisis.
 The report prompted hedge funds to sell the euro and other
currencies against the yen, traders said.
 ""Risk aversion continues to linger just below the surface and
further yen outperformance remains very likely over the
short-term as investors move into safe haven currencies,"" Matthew
Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets wrote.
 The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.2514, below a 6-week high
of $1.2613 set last week.
 In Asia, attention turns to the Australian dollar and the
Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) rate decision at 0430 GMT..
 The RBA is widely expected to leave rates on hold at 4.50
percent for a second straight month. Investors will scrutinise
the accompanying statement for the RBA's take on the financial
market turmoil and the risks of a global double-dip recession.
 Any added emphasis on the global troubles would reinforce
expectations that rates will be on hold for months and could lead
to a minor sell-off in the Aussie.
 The Australian dollar was at $0.8359, well off Monday's high
of $0.8467. Against the Japanese currency, the Aussie slid 0.7
percent to 73.16 yen.

record amount logged for all of 2005, Japanese finance ministry
data showed on Tuesday.
 Market players say the purchases do not represent a shift in
China's long-term investment stance but more a short-term move to
park funds in yen while sovereign debt concerns buffet the euro.
 The euro has sunk more than 14 percent against the dollar
this year, reflecting investor concerns over Europe's debt
crisis.
 ""In general, when overseas central banks cannot hold European
sovereign debt it makes sense for them to instead choose JGBs,
which have high liquidity,"" said Atsushi Ito, a strategist at
Morgan Stanley MUFJ Securities Japan.
 ""We already knew from other data that there has been overseas
demand for JGBs with durations of less than a year. Short-term
traders might react if China was among the buyers, but the
overall impact on the bond market is limited.""
 Lead September 10-year Japanese government bond futures were
little changed on Tuesday, down 0.07 point at 141.50.
 Analysts say China has been shifting some of its $2.4
trillion in foreign exchange reserves -- the world's largest
stockpile -- into a wider range of currencies in recent months,
including assets elsewhere in Asia and in commodity-producing
countries.
 Roughly a quarter is estimated to be held in euro-denominated
assets, primarily sovereign bonds, analysts say.
 Of the 541 billion yen ($6 billion) of JGBs purchased by
China in the first four months of this year, 517.7 billion yen
consisted of debt maturing in less than a year and 23.4 billion
yen was in medium- to long-term securities, the ministry data
showed.
 In April, China bought a net 197.8 billion yen of JGBs, the
second-biggest after Britain among foreign buyers, the ministry
said.

 * Aussie falls, RBA set to keep rates steady
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, July 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and the euro eased
against the yen in thin trade on Tuesday, while the Australian
dollar edged lower ahead of a central bank decision where it is
widely expected to be keep interest rates steady.
 ""Risk aversion continues to linger just below the surface and
further yen outperformance remains very likely over the
short-term as investors move into safe haven currencies,"" Matthew
Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets wrote.
 The euro  slipped to $1.2505, amid talk of option
strikes between $1.2500 and 1.2550, and resistance in the $1.2613
to $1.2620 area.
 The $1.2613 barrier is the high struck on Friday while
$1.2620 is the 38.2 percent retracement of the fall from $1.3817
on March 17 to a four-year low of $1.1875 struck on June 7.
 The euro also fell 0.4 percent to 109.57 yen , as
risk aversion continued to linger. Near term support for the euro
comes in at 109.12 yen, the June 30 high.
 Global risk appetite has taken a beating in the past few
weeks on growing worries about the health of the euro zone's
banking system, a slowdown in China and risks of a double-dip
recession in the United States.
 The U.S. dollar was subdued against the yen , trading
at 87.50 yen, and not far from a seven-month low of 86.94 yen
struck on July 1. The yen has made solid gains against the
greenback in recent sessions on back of growing worries about an
economic slowdown in the United States.
 Those concerns got a boost from a disappointing jobs report
from the U.S. which showed the economy shed 125,000 jobs in June.
It followed a raft of weak reports which suggested consumer
spending, housing and factory activity were moderating.
 As a result, the dollar index <.DXY> was trading just above
recent two-month lows, at 84.66, although investors were still
looking to pare long U.S. dollar positions and veer towards the
relative safety of the yen.
 In Asia, attention turns to the Australian dollar and the
Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) rate decision at 0430 GMT.
[AU/INT].
 The RBA is widely expected to leave rates on hold at 4.50
percent for the second straight month. Investors will scrutinise
the accompanying statement for the RBA's take on the financial
market turmoil and the risks of a global double-dip recession.
 Any added emphasis on the global troubles would reinforce
expectations that rates will be on hold for months and could lead
to a minor sell-off in the Aussie. The Aussie  was at
$0.8357, well off a high of $0.8467 in the previous session.

 By Fiona Shaikh
 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Britain's service sector enjoyed
its strongest growth for two years over the past three months
and manufacturing grew strongly, but tougher times may be ahead
as firms are gloomier about the future, a survey suggested on
Tuesday.
 The British Chambers of Commerce's Quarterly Economic Survey
showed the private-sector recovery gathering pace. The business
lobby's chief economist David Kern said the survey pointed to
economic growth of 0.6-0.7 percent in the second quarter, around
double the rate earlier this year.
 However, he warned that this growth was unlikely to be
sustained, as an impending clampdown on government spending
risked plunging the economy back into recession.
""Although we're champions of manufacturing, it's a worry for
the whole economy that services are not strong,"" he said,
pointing out that private-sector services activity was still
half its long-run average, despite the recent pick-up.
 ""We now have in place very tight fiscal policy for the next
few years. We think it's necessary, but this means the risk of a
double-dip recession is greater and makes it more necessary for
the Bank of England to keep interest rates low.""
 The new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition is planning
spending cuts of around 25 percent across government departments
to slash a deficit running close to 11 percent of economic
output.
 ""This year we won't see much impact from the fiscal
tightening because the stock cycle is strong and earlier fiscal
stimulus is still in place,"" Kern said. ""But I think the biggest
impact on the economy and jobs will come late this year and next
year.""
 The domestic sales balance for the services sector rose to
+12 from +6 in the first quarter, the highest reading since Q1
2008, and the orders balance rose 2 points over the quarter to
+5, also a two-year high.
 The manufacturing balances showed a much bigger improvement.
The home sales balance shot up to +30 from +1 and orders surged
to +19 from -3, both the highest since 2007.
 The survey also showed that the long-awaited boost to
exports from a past fall in sterling seemed to have
materialised, with the manufacturing export sales balance at its
highest in almost four years.
 
 INFLATION WORRY
 However, manufacturers also reported a surge in price
pressures, with a balance of +30 in Q2 compared with +8 in Q1,
the highest since Q3 2008. The BCC said 80 percent of firms
reported that they were under pressure to raise prices.
 That was mainly due to higher raw materials costs, rather
than wage costs, and should therefore be less worrying for the
Bank of England, as its policymakers largely discount one-off
rises in the cost of raw materials when they consider whether to
raise interest rates.
 ""It's critical at this point of the cycle to keep rates as
low as possible for as long as possible,"" Kern said. ""Fiscal
policy will inevitably increase the deflationary factors in the
economy.""
 The central bank is widely expected to keep borrowing costs
at 0.5 percent when its two-day meeting concludes on Thursday,
although one member, Andrew Sentance, voted for a quarter-point
hike last month.
 ""Clearly at a time when a higher fiscal contraction policy
is imminent, to hike rates is the wrong thing to do,"" Kern said.

 * Gains for Chilean currency on activity data fade
 By Samantha Pearson and Michael O'Boyle
 SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, July 5 (Reuters) - Latin American
currencies were little changed on Monday, with Mexico's peso
edging up as investors breathed a sigh of relief that Mexican
state elections went ahead without any major drug violence.
 Markets lacked much direction with U.S. markets on holiday
to mark Independence Day.
 The highest-level political assassination in Mexico in 16
years last week raised concerns that drug gangs were stepping
up political intimidation ahead of elections that were carried
out on Sunday in 12 states without major incidents of violence.
For more see [ID:nN05255979].
 Concerns about drug violence, which had rarely affected the
peso before, weighed on the Mexican currency during the week
and contributed to its underperformance compared to other
emerging market currencies.
 ""Worries about instability had hurt the peso. But
everything turned out fine with the elections in the end and
the peso could strengthen,"" said Gerardo Sienra, a trader at
brokerage Actinver in Mexico City.
 The Mexican peso  firmed 0.12 percent to 13.07 per
U.S. dollar, clawing back from a more than one-month low hit
earlier in the session.
 Another trader said the peso could firm back to 12.90 per
dollar as investors who had cut exposure to the peso before the
elections returned to the market.
 The difference in price for insuring against a default by
Mexico  or Brazil  has been
nearly unchanged since the murder of gubernatorial candidate
Rodolfo Torre in northeastern Mexico last week, according to
research firm Markit, indicating investors do not see rising
risks in Mexico relative to Brazil.
 An onslaught of weak U.S. data in recent weeks has also hit
the Mexican peso particularly hard because the country relies
on its northern neighbor to buy around 80 percent of its
exports.
 After early gains, Brazil's real  was 0.06 percent
weaker at 1.779 per U.S. dollar.
 Brazil's real is considered one of the most attractive
currencies in the region, since the country's economy is seen
growing around 7 percent this year and the central bank is
raising interest rates, offering global investors higher
returns than the paltry yields available from U.S. Treasuries.
 A flurry of fund-raising deals by Brazilian companies such
as Banco do Brasil, Latin America's largest bank by assets, has
boosted the real over recent weeks.
 The Chilean peso  gave up 0.33 percent to bid at
538.80 per U.S. dollar, reversing early gains after data showed
Chile's economy was recovering rapidly after a devastating
earthquake in late February. [ID:nN05181607]
 Traders said concerns about weakness in global markets
pushed investors to cash in on the gains.
 ""The unpredictable behavior of the markets has forced
people to be very cautious. There is also more uncertainty
because the markets in the United States are closed,"" a trader
said.
 Mexico's central bank also stormed ahead with more
syndicated bond offerings, announcing on Monday that it would
offer up to 25 billion pesos ($1.9 billion) on Tuesday in a
5-year peso bond through a syndicate of banks.
 Mexico began issuing syndicated bonds this year to issue
larger amounts of new bonds in one sale to more quickly create
benchmarks in the secondary markets. The move is part of
actions to meet criteria to be included in Citigroup's World
Government Bond Index (WGBI) later this year.
 The yield on the government's benchmark 10-year peso bond
 bid down 4 basis points to 6.84 percent, its lowest
ever. Inclusion in the WGBI would spur more flows from pension
and mutual funds that use it as a benchmark, and expectations
of more flows helped bond yields hit all-time lows last month.

 * Rehn - countries can use 500 billion euro safety net
 * Message designed to win back investor confidence
 (Recasts, updates with Rehn comments, adds background)
 By John O'Donnell and Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, July 5 (Reuters) - European Union countries that
discover problem banks when they stress-test their lenders
could turn to an existing EU state back-up scheme, the bloc's
economy chief said on Monday.
 EU Economy Commissioner Olli Rehn said that should any
government exhaust national funds in helping a troubled lender,
it could turn to ""EU financial backstops ... in the second line
of defence.""
 ""In order to use these European financial stability
mechanisms in the case of any country we would need to have a
programme ... focused in particular on the restructing of the
banking sector and addressing the potential needs of a possible
recapitalisation,"" Rehn told lawmakers in the European
parliament. ""That is the strategy.""
 It is the first time the European Commission or executive
has spelt out that countries struggling to recapitalise
stricken banks could tap a 500 billion euros scheme set up as a
safety net should borrowing problems in Greece spread to Spain
and beyond.
 By explaining what it would do should ""pockets of
vulnerability"" be uncovered by stress testing, Rehn hopes to
win back the confidence of jittery investors.
 Many are nervous that wider stress-testing of European
lenders could exacerbate problems of a cash-strapped state
which is suddenly forced to shore up the finances of one of its
banks which fails to come up to scratch. Rehn also partially
described one of the test criteria, which has proven
controverial.
 ""We are including the criteria of sovereign debt shock in
order to reinforce the credibility of results,"" he said,
without shedding further light on how this would be tested.
 Some countries are nervous that placing too high a hurdle
for banks in this regard, for example by simulating a default
by countries like Greece, could shatter investor confidence.
 Rehn said that the testing of banks would now be wider than
originally planned. The 27-country bloc had set out to examine
just 25 of its biggest banks.
 ""We are testing more banks including second-tier banks. For
instance, regional banks,"" he said. ""This gives a clear and
more accurate picture of the resiliance of the whole European
banking sector.""
 The European Commission or executive helps set the criteria
for testing alongside the bloc's countries and the European
Central Bank.

(Updates to close, adds quotes, details)
 By Jennifer Kwan
 TORONTO, July 5 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened
against the U.S. dollar on Monday as commodity prices fell on
persistent concerns about a slowdown in global growth.
 Weak world equity and oil prices -- key barometers of
global growth outlook and investor risk appetite -- helped to
send the currency as low as C$1.0678 to the U.S. dollar, or
93.65 U.S. cents, its weakest level since June 7. [MKTS/GLOB]
[O/R] [FRX/]
 Recent data showing the U.S. labor market shrank in June
for the first time this year, coupled with slower Chinese
manufacturing activity and euro zone austerity measures, fueled
concerns over prospects for the global economy.
 ""The outlook is quickly shifting to what the expectations
are for the Bank of Canada on July 20 as well as how the
downshift in global growth is going to impact the Canadian
economy generally,"" said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at
Scotia Capital.
 Canada's central bank raised its key interest rate to 0.5
percent from 0.25 percent on June 1 but has given no hints as
to its next move, scheduled for July 20. Yields on overnight
index swaps, which trade based on expectations for the Bank of
Canada's key policy rate, showed the market sees a 56 percent
chance of a July rate hike. [BOCWATCH]
 The Canadian dollar finished at C$1.0650 to the U.S.
currency, or 93.90 U.S. cents, down from Friday's finish at
C$1.0624 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.13 U.S. cents.
 Less than three months ago, the U.S. and Canadian
currencies were trading one for one, but the shift in recovery
expectations and turmoil in Europe have since weighed on
Canadian dollar.
 Sutton said given the global backdrop, key technical levels
to watch out for include C$1.0680 to the U.S. dollar and
C$1.0828.
 ""It just highlights that there is still upward momentum in
dollar/Canada and that it does then open up a test back to the
C$1.08 levels,"" she said.
 ""That becomes very significant if we're able to have enough
momentum to push us through there. That would really indicate a
shift in momentum for dollar/Canada.""
 Trading was also thin on Monday because of the U.S.
Independence Day holiday.
 ""A huge liquidity provider is absent and that just allows
trades to skew one way or the other,"" said Sutton.
 BONDS FIRMER
 Canadian government bond prices rose across the curve as
money flowed from equity markets and investors sought the
safety of government debt.
 The two-year government bond  climbed 7 Canadian
cents to yield 1.409 percent, while the 10-year bond
 rose 20 Canadian cents to yield 3.081 percent.
 On the data front, the key event will be Friday's domestic
employment figures for June, which are expected to show 15,000
jobs were added in the month, with the unemployment rate
staying steady at 8.1 percent. [ID:nN02188375]

 * No official ban in those countries
 * Financial Times says BP stops fuelling Iran flights
 * U.S. says commercial sector making ""right choices""

(Updates with BP report)
 By Parisa Hafezi
 TEHRAN, July 5 (Reuters) - Iran complained on Monday that
its planes had been denied fuel in Germany, Britain and the
United Arab Emirates, and Washington said commercial firms were
making the ""right choices"" by cutting business ties with Tehran.
 The Financial Times newspaper said oil major BP  had
stopped refueling Iranian jets. BP declined to confirm the
report but said: ""We fully comply with any international
sanctions imposed in countries where we operate.""
 Pressure is mounting on Iran over its nuclear programme and
the United States has stepped up its push to isolate Tehran
economically. On Thursday, President Barack Obama signed into
law far-reaching sanctions that aim to squeeze the Islamic
Republic's fuel imports and deepen its international isolation.
 ""Since last week, our planes have been refused fuel at
airports in Britain, Germany and UAE because of the sanctions
imposed by America,"" Mehdi Aliyari, secretary of the Iranian
Airlines Union, told Iran's ISNA news agency. So far national
carrier Iran Air and Mahan Airlines had been affected, he said.
 Washington has not spelled out whether its new sanctions are
intended to require firms to refuse to fuel Iranian jets at
airports in third countries, but U.S. officials made clear they
were pleased with reports sanctions had begun to bite.
 ""The costs of doing business with Iran, a country that is
shirking its international obligations across the board and
engaged in illicit activity, are rising,"" a senior Obama
administration official said on Monday.
 ""The international commercial sector is making the right
choices. It's now time for Iran to make the right choice -- to
fulfil its international obligations -- that remains our primary
objective,"" the official said.
 A source in the UAE familiar with the issue said a private
firm had refused to refuel an Iranian plane there, but the UAE
had imposed no ban of its own. The source did not name the firm.
 ""The UAE has nothing to do with it,"" the source said. ""They
(Iranian planes) are more than welcome."" The source added: ""It
is just one company and there are other companies. There are
other service providers and Iranians can seek deals with them.""
 A British government source said halting supplies would be a
commercial decision by private firms, but London was not aware
of any such incident in the UK. The German Transport Ministry
said there was no ban on refuelling Iranian flights in Germany.
 
 TIGHTENING FINANCIAL RULES
 Western powers believe Iran is trying to build bombs under
cover of a civilian nuclear programme. Tehran says the programme
is only for electricity generation and medical purposes.
 Sanctions appear to be having an impact. Over the past weeks
a number of countries and firms have cut back on imports of
Iranian crude oil. Other companies have stopped providing Iran
with refined petroleum. [ID:nLDE65R1O2]
 The UAE took steps last week to tighten its crucial role as
a trading and financial lifeline for Iran. The UAE Central Bank
asked financial institutions to freeze the accounts of 40
entities and an individual blacklisted by the United Nations for
assisting Iran's nuclear or missile programmes.
 The U.S. measures go far beyond U.N. sanctions imposed last
month, by targeting firms that sell refined oil products such as
gasoline to Iran, which despite being a major crude exporter
imports oil products because of a lack of refining capacity.
 However, Gala Riani at IHS Global Insight said preventing
the fuelling of Iranian flights seemed a ""very strict reading""
of the new U.S. law, which is more directed at trade in fuel.
 A spokeswoman for Abu Dhabi Airports Co (ADAC) in the UAE
capital said: ""We have contracts with Iranian passenger flights
and continue to allow refuelling.""
 Fuel traders from three different international firms said
they had heard of no ban on jet fuel sales to Iranian aircraft
at UAE airports. Said one trader: ""You can't allow a plane to
land and then not let it buy fuel.""

 * Habanos focusing on high end of cigar market
 * Company promoting new smoking places to fight bans
 By Marc Frank
 HAVANA, July 5 (Reuters) - Improved economies and new
tactics to fight smoking bans have led to increased sales of
Cuban cigars this year, after a decline of 7.7 percent in
2009, the exclusive international distributor of the world's
favorite cigars said on Monday.
 ""Through the end of May sales rose in practically all
regions and were up overall 4.3 percent and the tendency
continued in June,"" Manuel Garcia, vice president of sales for
Habanos S.A. told Reuters in an interview.
 The two big exceptions were in Spain and Greece, where
current economic crises have hit sales, he said.
 Cigar sales are an important source of income for the
cash-strapped communist-led island, garnering $218 million last
year.
 The company, a joint venture with British tobacco giant
Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, expects demand for premium cigars
to fall a few percentage points in the coming years.
 To boost revenues, it is targeting the highest end of the
market and fighting what amounts to a guerrilla war against the
global spread of smoking bans.
 ""Smoking bans and the economic environment do not allow you
to smoke more, so 'smoke better' is our motto,"" Garcia said.
 ""If you used to spend 15 euros ($18.75) a day or a week on
three cigars, now you might spend 16 euros ($22.50) on two
higher quality ones,"" he said.
 Last year the number of millionaires reportedly increased
significantly as the world recovered from financial crisis,
which was good news for luxury products like the famed
hand-rolled Cuban cigar, the Habanos executive said.
 ""The more people with money, the better it is for us, if
they smoke that is,"" Garcia said.
 Sales are strongest in the Asia-Pacific region, in
particular China, where the number of wealthy is growing faster
than in other regions.
 CURED COHIBA
 ""It is all about value added, collectibles, limited
editions, exclusives,"" said Javier Terres, the company's
development vice president, in the same interview.
 Terres pointed to the company's latest limited edition of a
specially cured Cohiba cigar, the Behike, that sells for at
least 35 euros ($43.75) and has received twice the orders as
the number available.
 He said a significant reduction in tobacco planting and
cigar production last year did not mean Habanos S.A. was on the
ropes.
 ""Although Habanos sales dropped in 2009, its share of the
premium cigar market improved,"" Terres said, ""and now accounts
for 71 percent of unit sales and 85 percent of value.""
 The numbers exclude the United States market, where sales
are banned under the longstanding U.S. trade embargo against
the island.
 Revolutionary Cuba has never been known for backing down
from a fight, so it is no surprise that Habanos is striking
back against smoking bans.
 ""Our fundamental objective is figuring out how we can get
around the bans and move forward in an extremely adverse
environment,"" Garcia said.
 ""Even if you have money you have to find a place where you
can enjoy a cigar, as it is not like a cigarette that you
consume in five minutes on the run,"" he said.
 The company has wholesale distributors in 70 countries, 142
specialized outlets called Casas de Habanos that promote cigars
and other Cuban merchandise such as rum and coffee, and
thousands of retailers that specialize in their product.
 Terres said they were all hard at work promoting what
Habanos calls ""Comfortable Outdoor Smoking Areas"" and private
cigar clubs in countries such as Germany and the United Arab
Emirates.
 The creation of outdoor smoking areas had already reversed
a downward trend in Britain, Terres said.
 ""The turn-around demonstrates the culture of the Habano
continues to exist, but in a completely new environment,"" he
said.

 * Tensions persist between Russia, Belarus
 
 By Denis Dyomkin and Raushan Nurshayeva
 ASTANA, July 5 (Reuters) - Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan
announced on Monday the launch of the second stage of a customs
union that could pave the way for an unprecedented joint
accession bid to the World Trade Organisation.
 But confused signals from officials and a lukewarm reception
by Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko, smarting over a gas
war with Moscow that briefly disrupted flows to Europe, suggest
Moscow and Minsk still have differences to settle on trade.
 Talks to create a free trade zone between Russia, Belarus
and Kazakhstan gained momentum last year when Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin said Moscow would delay its entry to the
WTO until the creation of such a customs union.
 The three states, whose leaders were attending a meeting of
the Evrazes grouping of ex-Soviet republics in the Kazakh
capital Astana, said in a joint statement that the second phase
of the customs union came into effect on July 1.
 ""Our formation has reached an advanced stage of integration
and the Russian Federation is happy about it,"" Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev told reporters
 The project, which analysts said was reignited by Putin's
frustration over dragging WTO talks, ran into difficulties when
Belarus asked Russia to sell duty-free oil and gas and declined
to raise import duties on used cars to Russian levels.
 Multiple stand-offs on trade issues have turned Lukashenko
from Moscow's closest ally on Russia's Western flank into one of
the Kremlin's biggest foes, culminating in a full-blown gas
dispute last month.
 Lukashenko said he hoped all countries would benefit from a
customs union, but refused to be drawn on his commitments.
 ""Let's wait and see,"" he said.
 Medvedev, who had earlier met one-on-one with Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, did not have a separate meeting
with Lukashehko. The Belarussian and Kazakh leaders had met the
previous evening.
 
 MOSCOW'S DEMANDS
 Analysts say the gas war between Russia and Belarus was
triggered by Moscow to punish Lukashenko for not bowing to
Kremlin demands on the customs union and for giving refuge to
former Kyrgyz president Kurmanbek Bakiyev.
 Though ultimately solved, prompting Lukashenko on Saturday
to say the Belarussian parliament had ratified all documents
necessary to set up the customs union, the Belarussian leader
also accused Moscow of ""lies"" and ""falsifications"".
 Nazarbayev said the three states would now bid together to
join the WTO, as proposed by Putin. ""We have agreed on entering
the WTO on the conditions agreed earlier,"" he said.
 Trade experts and both U.S. and EU officials have warned the
process of multilateral accession could be complicated, while
Russian officials -- including Medvedev -- have signalled Moscow
is keen to embark once again on unilateral talks.
 ""The Russian Federation has the least differences with our
trade partners (in the WTO),"" Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Igor Shuvalov told reporters in Astana. ""We have a good
chance of removing them fully in the coming weeks.""
 Shuvalov also said Minsk had insisted on removing all export
duties in bilateral trade, while Russia wanted to retain them.
He said the three states planned to remove all remaining
differences by 2011 -- a further six-month extension to the
initial deadline of January 2010.

 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, July 5 (Reuters) - Markets abhor a vacuum, and the
perception gap between euro zone policymakers and financial
professionals is almost certainly at its widest since the single
European currency's launch in 1999.
 That is one reason why southern European countries' bonds
remain under almost as much pressure as they faced before the EU
agreed on May 2 on a 110 billion euro bailout for Greece and a
week later on a giant financial safety net for euro zone
countries.
 It also helps explain why interbank lending has dried up in
some areas of Europe, with Iberian and Greek banks particularly
dependent on the European Central Bank for refinancing.
 Bankers and investors increasingly believe Greece is likely
to default on its debt in the next three to five years, and many
want Europe's authorities to create an orderly restructuring
process to share out the losses and avoid market panic.
 Policymakers, on the other hand, believe any talk of default
or restructuring is dangerous because it amplifies market panic,
undermines the credibility of the currency area and may prevent
Greece implementing the radical fiscal adjustment it has
accepted.
 That was a key dividing line between policy officials,
academic economists, international financial veterans and market
participants at a forum conducted under ground rules that
preclude indentifying speakers.
 In one forthright exchange, an investment manager said no
investor with fiduciary duties would invest in a country like
Greece that is forecast to have a debt of 150 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012 and will need to convert a budget
deficit of 13 percent of GDP last year into a 5 percent primary
surplus to put its debt on a downward trajectory.
 Markets were pricing in up to a 50 percent ""haircut"" on
Greece's sovereign debt, implying significant losses for the ECB
and euro zone member states that have lent it money.
 ""We have 18 months to come up with a European debt
restructuring mechanism before this problem is going to hit,""
the investment manager said, accusing the ECB and the European
Commission of ignoring the problem in their proposals.
 A euro zone government policymaker responded that EU leaders
had been clear that debt restructuring was ""not on the table"".
 ""Maybe we are in denial, but suicide is not a good way to do
business either,"" he said.
 
 ""MUDDLE THROUGH""
 Policymakers from the ECB, the European Commission and euro
zone governments see the key to overcoming the euro zone crisis
and restoring confidence mostly in strengthening and widening
Europe's fiscal rules and economic surveillance.
 The likely outcome, one of them said, was that the euro zone
would ""muddle through"" with adapted rules.
 By contrast, market players, academics and international
experts said the crisis had exposed fundamental design flaws in
European Monetary Union which have to be addressed for the euro
to retain credibility as an international reserve currency.
 Among the flaws highlighted were the absence of a fiscal or
economic union, the way cheap credit was allowed to fuel real
estate and consumer booms in countries like Spain, Portugal and
Ireland, and the failure of euro zone countries to think or act
as a bloc in social, welfare or labour policies.
 Speakers noted that Spain and Ireland, two of the countries
hardest hit by the crisis, had respected all the EU's fiscal
rules until their real estate and credit bubbles burst in 2007.
 Another big difference between market participants and the
policymakers concerned the timetable for overcoming the euro
zone's turmoil.
 European policymakers argued that turbulence should abate
within weeks, once the European Union has begun to implement
austerity measures, conducted transparent stress tests on its
top 100 banks and shown that the European Financial Stability
Facility backstop is up and running.
 But several of the bankers and investors warned it would
take years for confidence to return, once there was a clear
mechanism for resolving the debts of insolvent states, a
recapitalisation of banks found to be at risk and a longer-term
backstop for euro zone debt.
 Veteran former policymakers from the United States, Latin
America and Japan were more optimistic about the euro's survival
and growth as a reserve currency than some European investors.
 But they also expected the crisis to trigger bolder steps in
European economic and fiscal integration than seem politically
feasible in today's Europe.
 A Latin American central banking veteran of financial
rescues, arguing against any early move to restructure Greece's
debt, likened the euro zone's challenge to building a hospital.
 ""If you want patients to have confidence, you don't start by
building and showing off the morgue,"" he said.

 By Lin Noueihed
 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - The euro fell in subdued trade on
Monday after hitting a six-week high on weak U.S. jobs data late
last week, while the dollar steadied against a currency basket.
 Traders were wary of chasing the dollar lower with U.S.
markets closed on Monday for Independence Day.
 Concern about the U.S. economy mounted after Friday's jobs
data showed weak private hiring, raising fears that the global
economy could be heading for a double-dip recession and dragging
the dollar to a near two-month low against a currency basket.
 ""The market last week was clearly concerned about a U.S.
slowdown... It was the first week in a long time we have seen
the dollar react like that,"" Chris Turner, head of foreign
exchange strategy at ING, said.
 ""There is a creeping fear that the strong dollar environment
will start to break. That has not happened yet and it is likely
to be steady this week.""
 By 1408 GMT, the euro eased 0.3 percent to $1.2522, with
support seen close to Friday's low around $1.2480. The euro fell
0.4 percent versus the yen on corporate selling.
 Options with a strike price of $1.2500 expiring on Tuesday
may also cap the downside, traders said.
 Last week, the euro gained 1.5 percent against the dollar
after hitting a four-year low around $1.1875 in June.
 The euro briefly rose 10 pips to around $1.2545 after the
euro zone Sentix investors sentiment index improved to -1.3 in
July from -4.1 the previous month, beating expectations for a
fall to -5.0.
 
 QUIET TRADE
 A final reading of the euro zone Services Purchasing
Managers' Index, which suggested private sector expansion may
have peaked in the second quarter, had little impact on markets
looking to a meeting of the European Central Bank on Thursday.
 No ECB rate change is expected and debt fears have eased
after successful issuance by peripherals last week.
 ""It's very quiet on the U.S. front this week and the ECB
won't be a big trigger,"" said Peter Frank, currency strategist
at Societe Generale.
 ""There's been such a big washout of previous positions it is
unclear if it's an upside or downside trend for euro/dollar.
Everyone is sidelined at the moment and looking for clarity.""
 Markets were looking to a statement from Australia's central
bank at its July 6 policy review. Economists expect no rate
change but will look for indications of global risk sentiment.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.25 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday at 84.641. On
Friday, it fell to 84.132, its lowest since mid-May.
 Friday's U.S. monthly jobs report showed employment fell for
the first time this year. The data followed reports suggesting
U.S. spending, housing and factory activity was moderating. 
 The dollar was flat against the yen at 87.74, after hitting
a seven-month low of 86.96 yen set last week. Data from the
Currency Futures Trading Commission showed net long yen
positions jumped in the week to June 29.
 One-month implied volatility eased to 11.2/11.8 from around
13 percent last week when the dollar slid to a 7-month low of
86.96 yen.
 The Swiss franc held off recent record highs against the
euro after the head of the Swiss National Bank said it was
following currency movements closely. 
 Markets will watch Swiss consumer price data for June on
Tuesday to see if deflation pressures could return, and Frank
said any surprises could require further SNB comment. The euro
fell 0.1 percent versus the Swiss franc to 1.3333 francs.

 KIEV, July 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine is likely to see stronger
economic growth and tamer inflation in 2010 than analysts had
previously expected, a Reuters survey showed on Monday, as the
ex-Soviet republic looked set to win new support from the IMF.
 Ukrainian gross domestic product is likely to grow 4.2
percent in 2010, analysts said, raising their view from 3.9
percent a month earlier. They now see Q2 GDP growing 5.2
percent, up from 4.2 percent in a previous poll.
 Analysts also cut their average forecast for 2010 inflation
in Ukraine to 11 percent from 12.2 percent a month ago, and they
expect the June consumer price index year-on-year to slow from
15 percent to 8 percent.
 The more optimistic forecasts were linked with the
likelihood of the Ukraine restarting a cooperation programme
with the International Monetary Fund in coming weeks and
receiving credit for supporting the balance of payments and
financing its budget deficit.
 An IMF mission said at the end of a visit to Ukraine on
Saturday that it would recommend to the board of IMF directors a
loan of $14.9 billion in a 2-1/2 year stand-by facility.
[ID:nLDE66204F]
 Analysts said the IMF support would help Ukraine borrow more
cheaply on the international market from the middle of July and
help bring greater stability to its financial market.
 ""The (IMF) programme will give an unambiguous signal for a
lowering of credit risk on sovereign debt. The spreads on the
eurobond market and CDS spreads will also fall,"" said Olexander
Valchishen of Invest Capital Ukraine.
 The government sees 2010 inflation at 13.1 percent, compared
with 12.3 percent last year, and GDP growth at 3.7 percent,
marking a rebound from a 15 percent contraction last year.
 Government officials, however, repeatedly said in June that
forecasts would improve in September as inflation slowed and the
economic recovery picked up pace.
 According to the State Statistics Committee, inflation in
May this year dropped to 8.5 percent from 14.7 percent in the
same month last year, while GDP growth in Q1 reached 4.9 percent
compared with minus 20.2 percent in January-March last year. The
Statistics Committee only publishes quarterly GDP data.
 The IMF foresees Ukrainian economic growth in 2010 at 3.7
percent and inflation at around 9.2 percent.

 The European Union has also decided to implement additional

Iran lacks sufficient refining capacity which makes it
potentially vulnerable to sanctions.
 The United States and its European allies fear Iran is
trying to build bombs under cover of a civilian nuclear

 By Lin Noueihed
 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Monday
after falling on weak U.S. jobs data late last week, while the
euro edged down in subdued trade as concern over euro zone debt
receded but markets fretted about the strength of the recovery.
 Traders were wary of chasing the dollar lower given a U.S.
market holiday on Monday in observance of Independence Day.
 Concern about the U.S. economy mounted after Friday's jobs
data showed weak private hiring, raising fears that the global
economy could be heading for a double-dip recession and dragging
the dollar to a near two-month low against a currency basket.
 ""The market last week was clearly concerned about a U.S.

dollar react like that,"" Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange
strategy at ING, said.
 ""There is a creeping fear that the strong dollar environment

 By 1103 GMT, the euro  eased 0.3 percent to $1.2524,
with support seen close to Friday's low of around $1.2480. Last
week, the euro gained 1.5 percent against the dollar after
hitting a four-year low around $1.1875 in June.
 Options with a strike price of $1.2500 expiring on Tuesday
may also cap the downside, traders said.
 The euro briefly rose about 10 pips versus the dollar to

month, beating expectations for a fall to -5.0 [nBAF004155]. 
 A final reading of the euro zone Services Purchasing
Managers' Index, which suggested private sector expansion may
have peaked in the second quarter, had little impact on markets
mainly looking ahead to a meeting of the European Central Bank
on Thursday.
 ""We are really in a holding pattern,"" said Daragh Maher,
deputy head of global foreign exchange research at Credit
Agricole CIB. ""The highlight for the euro is the ECB meeting on
Thursday but... nothing is expected there. The sovereign space
has calmed down.""
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Friday at 84.604 <.DXY>. On
Friday, it fell to 84.132, its lowest since mid-May.
 Short-term support was seen around 83.20, roughly a 38.2
percent retracement of the index's move to a high near 88.71 in
June from a low of 74.17 in November.
 Friday's U.S. monthly jobs report showed the economy shed
125,000 jobs in June, while private payrolls rose less than
expected. Overall employment fell for the first time this year
as thousands of temporary census jobs ended.
 The data followed a raft of weak reports that suggested U.S.

hike
 * Bond yields, swap rates rise, shares ease on rate move
 * Strike in protest of fuel price hike shuts parts of
country
 By Swati Bhat and Neha D'silva
 MUMBAI, July 5 (Reuters) - Investors bet India's central
bank will raise interest rates for a second time this month on
July 27, even as a strike to protest higher fuel prices shut
parts of the country on Monday, highlighting growing pressures
facing policymakers.
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surprised markets late on
Friday by raising its policy rates 25 basis points (bps), its
third hike so far this year as it struggles to contain
inflation which has accelerated into the double digits.
 HSBC said it expects a further 125 bps in rate increases
over the next 12 months, including a 25 bps move at the RBI's
scheduled quarterly review on July 27.
 ""The RBI has clearly taken up the inflation battle. But,
the surprise hike last week is not enough. More needs to be
done,"" HSBC economist Frederic Neumann said in a Monday note.
 ""Expect another 25 bps tweak at the end of the month at the
regular meeting, and much in terms of hawkish language,"" he
said, referring to indications of further policy tightening.
 One-year overnight swap rates  jumped as much
as 27 basis points to 5.68 percent, their biggest daily gain in
20 months, as markets reacted to Friday's rate move, which was
announced after markets had closed. The swap rate later drifted
back slightly to 5.66 percent. [ID:nSGE66408W]
 ""The market by and large wasn't expecting anything (on
rates) till July 27, so it is a short-end surprise,"" said
Ananth Narayan G., head of rates and credit for South Asia at
Standard Chartered Bank.
 Dealers said the market was now expecting at least another
25 bps rate rise on July 27, with some even predicting a 50 bps
hike as the recent fuel price increases feeds through to the
broader economy.
 The fuel price hikes, announced late last month to help
bring the fiscal deficit under control, are expected to lift
wholesale price index (WPI) inflation that is already in excess
of 10 percent by nearly one percentage point, testing the
government's resolve on reforms. [ID:nSGE66409F]
 But analysts say the ruling Congress party is unlikely to
back down on fuel prices, even as opposition workers set buses
on fire in a strike that paralyzed parts of the country on
Monday, including many businesses in the financial capital
Mumbai. [ID:nSGE66409F]
 The benchmark five-year swap rate  rose 13
basis points to 6.77 percent, the highest since June 28.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond  was
at 7.62 percent after rising to 7.65 percent, its highest since
June 25. It had ended at 7.56 percent on Friday.

 MORE TO COME
 Policymakers have been hoping for a strong harvest to curb
price pressures later this year. Last summer's drought drove
food prices higher, which eventually spilled over into other
parts of the economy.
 After faltering initially, key monsoon rains have now
advanced into the country's key grain-producing states of
Punjab and Haryana, allaying fears of crop losses, forecasters
said on Monday. [IDnSGE6640CS].
 Indian shares <.BSESN> ended marginally lower, with
disappointing U.S. jobs data adding to worries of a sharp

 Such concerns could temper the pace of further central bank
rate increases, some market watchers said.
 ""We are at a cusp: inflation may be close to peaking and
the monsoon has just begun, and we will not know if that will
be good or otherwise. It's a slack season for credit and the
global economy is not showing revival, so aggressive (policy)
tightening may not be seen,"" said R.K. Gurumurthy, head of
treasury at ING Vysya Bank.

 By Marcin Grajewski
 BRUSSELS, July 5 (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales rose
moderately in May after a sharp decline in April, data showed on
Monday, pointing to continued weakness in consumer spending and
a fragile economic recovery.
European Union statistics office Eurostat said retail sales
in the 16 countries that share the euro single currency, a good
indication of households' propensity to spend, rose 0.2 percent
during the month and 0.3 percent since May last year.
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4 percent
monthly increase and a 0.3 percent year-on-year decline.
 For full details and a table please see:
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-05072010-AP/EN/4-05072010-AP-EN.PDF
 ""The underlying softness in euro zone retail sales is
highlighted by their being only flat in the three months to May
compared to the three months to February,"" said Howard Archer,
chief European economist at IHS Global Insight.
 ""Indeed, the ingredients hardly form a heady cocktail for
euro zone consumer spending -- confidence is relatively subdued
and fragile, the euro zone unemployment rate is currently at a
near 12-year high ..., wage growth is muted, and fiscal policy
is being tightened appreciably in many countries.""
 Eurostat revised up the April retail sales figure to -0.9
percent month-on-month and -0.5 percent annually, from previous
readings of -1.2 percent and -1.5 percent respectively.
 Consumer demand is weak because unemployment in the euro
zone is near 12-year highs of 10 percent and may rise further,
keeping a lid on wage growth and limiting households' spending.
 Retailers in Europe have been struggling with weak consumer
morale despite signs of economic recovery as many government
ordered spending cuts to alleviate the sovereign debt crisis.
 ""Although ... the confidence fallout from the sovereign debt
crisis has been relatively contained thus far, the prospect of
fiscal austerity is likely to weigh on consumer spending
intentions going forward, especially in the periphery,"" said
Martin van Vliet, economist at ING.
 Eurostat said food drinks and tobacco sales increased 0.2
percent month-on-month in the euro zone in May while non-food
products were up 0.4 percent. Year-on-year, the figures were 0.3
and 1.0 percent respectively.
 Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, saw retail sales
grow 0.4 percent in May, while France rose by 0.2 percent.
 In the whole 27-nation European Union retails trade
increased by 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, boosted by figures in
non-euro Britain and Poland.
 IHS Global Insight's Archer said May retail sales was
another figure in a recent string of data that strengthened
expectations that the European Central Bank would keep its main
interest rate down at 1.00 percent long into 2011.

 * Euro zone services PMI also slips
 * British services growth at 10-month low
 
 By Ross Finley
 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Global services growth geared
down a notch in June, data showed on Monday, supporting the view
in financial markets that emerging and developed economies are
set to cool off through the second half of the year.
 The reports followed a series of similar health-checks on
global manufacturing last week which told a similar story and
which together could stoke smouldering fears of a double-dip
recession in some developed economies.
 China's services sector growth slowed to its weakest in 15
months and the surveys showed a similar slowdown from heady
rates across Europe, where governments are taking the hatchet to
budgets and where consumer spending is already lacklustre.
 ""The euro zone debt crisis and an associated intensified
tightening of fiscal policy in a number of countries is having a
dampening impact on economic activity across the region,"" said
Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight.
 The reports followed news on Friday that the U.S. economy
shed 125,000 jobs in June, the largest decline since October,
showing the world's largest economy is failing to accelerate on
its own as government stimulus fades.
 World stocks have tumbled 13 percent over the past two
months on fears that the world recovery from the worst recession
in generations is faltering, although a U.S. market holiday left
them directionless on Monday.
 HSBC said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for China's
services sector -- which unlike most developed economies,
represents less than half of its output -- fell to a 15-month
low of 55.6 in June from 56.4. [ID:nTOE661064]
 Although that was well above the threshold of 50 that
separates expansion from contraction, the loss of momentum,

 The CIPS/Markit Services PMI fell for the third time in four
months and more than expected to 54.4, a 10-month low,

thanks to a slowdown in orders for new business. [ID:nSLA2IE689]

 * Strong demand fueled by high-tech, fashion industries
 * TNT shares slightly outperform Amsterdam bourse

(Adds company, analyst comment, details, shares)
 AMSTERDAM, July 5 (Reuters) - Dutch logistics group TNT NV
said on Monday it would increase air freight capacity to China
on strong demand for its services in the world's third-largest
economy and Europe's number one trade partner.
 Chinese exports to Europe rose almost 50 percent during the
five first months of 2010 from a year before, according to the
Chinese General Administration of Customs, and TNT has benefited
particularly from demand from high-tech and fashion industries,
the company said.
 Europe's second-largest mail and delivery company said it
was doubling its service frequency to six flights per week from
Shanghai and adding two more flights to make five per week from
Hong Kong after it scheduled an additional Boeing 747-400 ERF
aircraft between China and its European air hub in Liege,
Belgium.
 ""TNT has seen a significant increase in customer demand for
freight services between the regions. Our current freighters
between China and Europe are operating at full capacity,"" said
Iman Stratenus, Managing Director of TNT China.
 China, whose economy saw year-on-year growth of 11.9 percent
in the first quarter of 2010, has proved a boon for TNT's drive
to push its day-definite freight product offerings to emerging
markets, with its Hoau domestic service posting a 28 percent
underlying revenue growth in the first quarter.
 ""(The year) 2011 remains a big question mark as confirmed by
(Deutsche Post's) DHL, and TNT should be able to counter this by
leveraging on its network in South America and Asia,"" KBC
analyst Dieter Furniere wrote in a note.
The decision to expand its services in emerging markets
contrasts with the structural decline seen in its domestic Dutch
mail market where TNT last week said it would to press on with
the largest job-cutting drive in its history as European volumes
continue to be eroded by competition.
 TNT shares were up 0.2 percent to 20.44 euros at 0901 GMT,
outperforming Amsterdam's bluechip index, which was down 0.21
percent. TNT shares are down 5 percent since the start of 2010,
whereas the index has dropped more than 8 percent.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - World stock and oil prices fell
on Monday on growing concerns of slowdowns in the United States
and China -- the two main pillars of global growth, though the
dollar was off its two-month low.
 Trading was expected to be light on Monday because of the
U.S. Independence Day holiday.
 Data showing the U.S. labour market shrank for the first
time this year in June, slower Chinese manufacturing activity
and euro zone austerity measures fuelled concerns over prospects
for the global economy.
 ""Double-dip (recession) fears are the pervading influence on
market psychology at present even as European sovereign (debt)
concerns appear to be easing,"" said Mitul Kotecha, global head
of foreign exchange strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong
Kong.

last week. The index has lost 16.2 percent since mid-April, and
is down 11 percent for the year.
 The index carried a one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio

10-year average of 15.42, according to Thomson Reuters
DataStream.

short and leveraged positions. It slipped 0.3 percent to $1.2521

 The shared European currency has lost 12.5 percent against
the dollar so far this year, though attention now appears to
have turned to concerns of a slowdown in the United States and
away from the euro zone's banking and government debt woes.
 ""The market last week was clearly concerned about a U.S.
slowdown. It was the first week in a long time we have seen the
dollar react like that,"" said Chris Turner, head of foreign
exchange strategy at ING.
 ""There is a creeping fear that the strong dollar environment

 * New orders growth slowing, may signal slowdown
 * Composite euro zone PMI dips but jobs grow for 2nd month
 
 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - The recovery of the euro zone's
dominant service sector slowed in June, according to a survey
that suggested private sector expansion may have already peaked
in the second quarter of the year.
 Markit said its final Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers'
Index of around 2,000 companies, ranging from banks to hotels,
fell to 55.5 in June from May's 33-month high of 56.2, although
it was revised up slightly from a preliminary estimate of 55.4.
 While still comfortably above the 50 mark that divides
growth from contraction, signs of wilting new orders --
particularly in No.1 economy Germany -- could point to a
slowdown of growth in forthcoming quarters.
 ""Question marks over the sustainability of this growth are
raised by the marked easing in new business inflows in June, led
by falls in new work in both Germany and Spain,"" said Markit's
chief economist, Chris Williamson.
 He pointed to worries about the weakness of the banking
sector, government budget deficits and intensifying austerity
measures as factors troubling businesses and consumers.
 The euro zone services new orders sub-index fell to 52.8 in
June from 54.2 in May, dragged down by the German survey which
showed new business contracting for the first time since
November last year.
 Fragile domestic demand in European countries has caused
alarm among Washington policymakers.
 Before Group of 20 nation summits last month, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner warned European countries not to risk
a return to recession by cutting government spending too hard
and too fast, echoing comments from U.S. President Barack Obama.
 Still, Britain unveiled its toughest budget in a generation
in June and German Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeated her
commitment to 80 billion euros ($98 billion) of cuts over the
next four years.
 June's composite euro zone PMI, which combines the services
index and last Thursday's manufacturing index, dipped slightly
to 56.0 from 56.4 in May and also showed slowing growth of new
orders.
 The employment index, which signalled a return to modest
jobs growth in private sector firms in May, rose again in June
to 50.6 from 50.5.
 Euro zone unemployment held steady in May at 10 percent,
backing up the May PMI surveys that showed labour market
conditions had stopped deteriorating.
 Markit said the average level of the composite activity
index during the second quarter of 2010 is consistent with
quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) growth of around 0.6 to
0.7 percent, based on a historical relationship.
 Median forecasts from more than 60 economists polled by
Reuters two weeks ago said they expected growth of 0.5 percent
in the second quarter.
 Like the Reuters poll, the composite PMI overall pointed to
slower growth ahead.
 ""Companies, especially in the periphery, need to regain
confidence in the economic outlook if a further slowing in
growth and even double-dip recessions for some countries are to
be avoided,"" said Markit's Williamson.

 By Johan Sennero and Johan Ahlander
 VISBY, Sweden, July 5 (Reuters) - Sweden's finance minister
said on Monday the economy will grow faster than previously
thought this year and the country is well-prepared for any
fallout from Europe's debt woes, though some expressed a more
cautious view.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg, speaking a few months before a
general election, cited forecasts for lower unemployment than
seen in the April budget and a return to surplus in public
finances in 2012.
 ""The recovery in the Swedish economy is increasingly evident
with better growth prospects and a stronger job market,"" Borg
said at a seminar on the island of Gotland in Southern Sweden,
where politicians met for an annual gathering.
 ""This will strengthen public coffers and Sweden's ability to
meet the increased economic concerns that arise in the wake of
the uncertain situation regarding state finances in the wider
world.""
 Sweden's economy has picked up in recent months after the
worst downturn since World War Two saw output contract 5.1
percent in 2009. 
 Last week, the Riksbank raised interest rates for the first
time since the financial crisis hit in late 2008, though it said
the debt problems in Europe meant rates would probably not rise
as fast or as much in the years ahead. [ID:nLDE6600H3]
 Borg said Sweden's economy would grow 3.3 percent this year,
higher than the 2.5 percent previously expected.
 He trimmed the government's growth forecast for 2011 to 3.8
percent from 3.9 percent, but he also forecast growth of 3.9
percent in 2012, another upgrade.
 
 TOO ROSY?
 Roger Josefsson, an economist at Danske Markets said that
with Europe, the United States, Japan and Britain adopting
austerity policies, demand from at least two-thirds of Sweden's
export markets would fall.
 ""That is naturally going to hit Swedish exports and through
that GDP,"" he said.
 Sweden's central bank also has a less upbeat view than the
government. It has raised its growth forecast for 2010 to 3.8
percent but pencilled in growth of 2.8 percent in 2012 due to
lower demand, principally from Europe. [ID:nLDE65S0VN]
 Europe is weighed down by debt, and weak U.S. employment,
home sales and factory data last week stoked fears that the
recovery there is beginning to stutter. [ID:nN01108492]
 Still, if the global economy hits rough waters again, Sweden
has the luxury of strong public finances to support it.
 Borg forecast a public deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP this
year but said he expected a surplus of 0.7 percent in 2012.
 The government is not planning a spending splurge to win
votes in what is expected to be a tight election in September,
however. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt also said at the
weekend that the ruling coalition would not cut taxes in 2011 if
re-elected. [ID:nLDE6630CS]
 Borg held out little prospect of reducing the burden -- one
of Europe's heaviest -- on taxpayers in the next four years.
 ""The direction of policy ... will be to return public
finances to balance and then surplus, protect core welfare
services and continue to strengthen job policies,"" he said.

 LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied in subdued
trade on Monday after hitting a near two-month low against a
currency basket after soft U.S. jobs data late last week, while
the euro paused after hitting a six-week high.
 Traders were wary of chasing the dollar lower given a U.S.
market holiday on Monday in observance of Independence Day.
 Concerns about the U.S. economy mounted after Friday's jobs
data showed weak private hiring, and capping a week of soft
economic figures.
 ""The dollar is responding more to weak signs in the U.S.
economy,"" said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 At 0723 GMT, the dollar index, which tracks the performance
of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies,
was flat from late U.S. trade on Friday at 84.440. On Friday, it
fell to 84.132, its lowest since mid-May.
 Short-term support is seen around 83.20, roughly a 38.2
percent retracement of the index's move from a low of 74.17 in
November to a high near 88.71 in June.
 The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.2548, with support seen
around its 55-day moving average, currently near $1.2530. Last
week, the euro gained 1.5 percent against the dollar after
hitting a four-year low around $1.1875 in June.
 It faced resistance near $1.2595, the bottom of the cloud on
daily Ichimoku charts, and then near $1.2620, a 38.2 percent
retracement of its drop from its March high near $1.3820 down to
its four-year low.
 Options with strike price of $1.2500 expiring on Tuesday may
also cap movements, traders said.
 Friday's monthly jobs report showed the economy shed 125,000
jobs in June, while private payrolls rose less than expected.
Overall employment fell for the first time this year as
thousands of temporary census jobs ended.
 The data followed a raft of weak reports that suggested U.S.
consumer spending, housing and factory activity were moderating.

 ""Double-dip fears are the pervading influence on market
psychology at present even as European sovereign concerns appear
to be easing,"" analysts at Credit Agricole CIB said in a note.
 The dollar edged up 0.2 percent against the yen to 87.92
yen, pulling further away from a seven-month low of 86.96 yen
set last week, with some talk of dollar buying by Japanese
importers.
 Data from the Currency Futures Trading Commission showed net
long yen positions jumped in the week to June 29. The value of
the dollar's net long position slipped to about $9.5 billion in
the week ended June 29 from $12.2 billion in the prior week.

 One-month implied volatility hovered near 12 percent, down
from around 13 percent last week as the dollar slid to a 7-month
low of 86.96 yen.
 The Swiss franc held off from recent record highs against
the euro after the Swiss National Bank head said the central
bank was keeping a close eye on the currency.
 ""The currency fluctuations of the Swiss franc have indeed
picked up in the last weeks. The SNB is following these
developments on the foreign exchange market very closely,"" Swiss
National Bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand said in an interview
published on Swiss website blick.ch on Sunday.

 * Sharp forex moves affect economic activity
 * Big fiscal tightening would hurt European growth
 * Comments on TIBOR push up euroyen futures
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Leika Kihara and Yoshiyasu Shida
 TOKYO, July 5 (Reuters) - Global financial markets remain
jittery with little progress being made in dealing with the root
cause of Europe's debt woes, a senior Bank of Japan (BOJ)
official said on Monday.
 Haruyuki Toyama, head of the central bank's financial markets
department, also said the Tokyo interbank lending rate (TIBOR) --
the rate at which commercial banks lend and borrow to each other
-- does not reflect real interest rates in the market place.
 ""There is a discrepancy between the TIBOR and real market
rates,"" Toyama told Reuters in an interview.
 ""When there is a discrepancy between TIBOR and real market
rates, it could distort rates in other markets. From the
standpoint of ensuring proper market function, I hope the TIBOR
is determined appropriately.""
 The comments helped push up euroyen interest rate futures on
expectations the BOJ will encourage a fall in TIBOR, a reference
rate calculated from rates provided by a pool of banks.
 TIBOR has been fixed at much higher levels than actual rates
in markets despite the BOJ's ultra-easy monetary policy as
commercial banks base lending rates they charge corporate
borrowers on TIBOR. To them, a lower TIBOR means less profit.
 The benchmark three-month TIBOR was set at 0.37615 percent on
Monday, higher than euroyen futures yield of around 0.25 percent.
 EUROPE BANKING WOES REMAIN
 Toyama said it will take some time before market confidence
is regained in Europe's banking sector, adding that the BOJ will
carefully watch how developments affect financial markets.
 Persistent worries about Europe's banking problems have led
investors to seek a safe haven in bonds and shun risky assets.
 Share prices also suffered big losses last week as weak U.S.
and Chinese economic data heightened concerns that the global
economy could be entering a new downturn.
 Some countries, notably the United States, worry that the
fiscal tightening policies now being adopted in Europe could add
to the pain.
 Toyama echoed this view, warning that while Europe's fiscal
consolidation will help ease market worries about its debt woes,
tightening simultaneously could backfire.
 ""Big fiscal tightening, when taken all at once, will have a
negative impact on the economy in the short term, although some
of it will be offset by confidence (in fiscal policy),"" he said.
 ""I understand this has been discussed by the G20. But I hope
due consideration is paid to the impact on the economy.""
 Asked whether the yen's recent sharp gains will hurt Japan's
economy, Toyama said: ""I'd like to refrain from commenting on
currency levels. But in general, sharp currency moves affect
household and corporate activity.""
 The dollar edged up against the yen on Monday but remains
near a seven-month low of 86.96 yen hit last week as risk-shy
investors sought a safe haven in the Japanese currency.
 The yen's rise has brought it to levels that could cause pain
to Japanese exporters, with the BOJ's tankan corporate sentiment
survey showing large manufacturers forecasting an average
dollar/yen rate of 90.18 yen for the year to next March.
 The Ministry of Finance rather than the BOJ has jurisdiction
over Japan's currency policy. The central bank conducts currency
intervention on behalf of the ministry.
 BOND BUYING CAP STAYS
 The BOJ has kept interest rates near zero since late 2008,
and eased monetary policy last December and again in March by
setting up and later expanding a facility offering cheap funds to
banks.
 It also buys 21.6 trillion yen ($246.2 billion) of long-term
government bonds outright each year as part of measures to supply
funds to the market.
 The BOJ sets a self-imposed rule of capping its government
bond holds to the amount of bank notes in circulation, to avoid
giving markets the impression it may monetise public debt.
 Toyama said the BOJ's government bond holdings could reach
the self-imposed cap within several years. But he said there was
no need to change the rule.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, July 5 (Reuters) - The dollar held at its lowest in
nearly two months on Monday and the euro paused after last week's
boost from unwinding of short and leveraged positions, with
traders and analysts seeing scope for it to squeeze a bit higher.
 With attention turning to a slowdown in the United States and
away from the euro zone's banking and government debt woes,
analysts said the next upside target for the euro was a May
reaction high at $1.2673.
 Leveraged trades funded in the euro, be it long dollar,
commodity currencies or emerging markets, were being cut, while
at the same time the euro selling seen in April and May looked to
be exhausted for now.
 ""I'm not seeing money flooding back into euro on a broad
basis. You really have to describe it as exhaustion,"" said Greg
Gibbs, FX strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Sydney.
 The question for markets at this point, with concern that the
U.S. recovery was losing steam, was what should they buy.
 ""The fear of maybe not necessarily double-dip but certainly a
very long period of low employment growth and very low rates is
definitely playing into the markets' view,"" Gibbs said.
 The euro eased 0.2 percent to $1.2542, with near term support
seen around its 55-day moving, currently at $1.2531. Last week,
the euro gained 1.5 percent against the dollar, reversing a loss
from the previous week and gaining greater distance from June's
four-year low at $1.1876.
 Traders also said talk of repatriation by European banks
helped lift the euro.
 Jonathan Cavenagh, currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney,
said leveraged trades funded in euro were being cut and the low
level of yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasuries suggested the euro
should be trading higher.
 U.S. yields have fallen sharply after a slew of soft U.S.
economic numbers suggested recovery would be tepid. The 10-year
note yield has fallen below the psychological 3 percent mark,
trading at 2.98 percent.
 Friday's monthly jobs report showed the economy shed 125,000
jobs in June, while private payrolls rose less than expected.
Overall employment fell for the first time this year as thousands
of temporary census jobs ended.
 The data followed a raft of weak reports which suggested
consumer spending, housing and factory activity were moderating.

 The dollar lost ground last week before the data and on
Friday the dollar index hit its lowest level in nearly two months
at 84.132.
 By Monday, it had steadied at 84.499, with short-term support
seen at around 83.20, roughly a 38.2 percent retracement of the
index's move from a low of 74.17 in November to a high of 88.71
in June. Trade was quiet, with U.S. markets closed for a holiday.
 The dollar edged up against the yen, pulling further away
from a 7-month low of 86.96 yen set last week, with some talk of
dollar buying by Japanese importers.
 But it lost 1.8 percent against the yen last week as U.S.
yields fell, and traders said there was talk of options triggers
below 85 yen. The dollar hasn't fallen below 85 yen since
November last year when it hit a 14-year low at 84.82 yen.
 Data from the Currency Futures Trading Commission showed net
long yen positions jumped in the week to June 29. The value of
the dollar's net long position slipped to about $9.5 billion in
the week ended June 29, from $12.2 billion in the prior week.
 The Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar edged up
slightly against the greenback.
 But they still looked vulnerable after losing almost 4
percent last week, with sentiment hurt by weekend news that
China's non-manufacturing PMI had eased below 60 in June,
following manufacturing surveys also showing expansion slowing.

 TOKYO, July 5 (Reuters) - New inflows into Japanese retail
mutual funds dropped sharply for the second month in a row in
June, industry data showed, as global share prices fell and
worries over the euro zone debt crisis lingered.
 Newly launched investment trusts or ""toushin"" attracted 101.9
billion yen ($1.16 billion) worth of funds in June, down 50
percent from 203.9 billion yen the month before, numbers from
Thomson Reuters fund research company Lipper showed.
 Inflows in June were the smallest since February 2009.
 Inflows into newly launched toushin fell sharply for two
straight months after reaching 452.7 billion yen in April -- the
highest level since September 2006.
 Investment into toushin from retail investors tends to drop
when share prices fall and when the yen appreciates.
 The benchmark Nikkei average dropped to a seven-month closing
low last week after hitting an 18-month high of above 11,000 in
early April.
 It stood at 9,238.01 on Monday, up 34.30 points or 0.37
percent.
 Yet Japanese individuals, who hold $15 trillion in personal
assets, still mostly parked in low-yielding accounts, are keen to
gain more exposure to foreign funds in the long term, especially
in emerging markets, to secure wealth post retirement.
 The Lipper data showed that there were 25 investment trust
funds launched in June, unchanged from the previous month, but
sharply lower than 45 in April.
 An investment fund that invests in Asian convertible bonds
launched by Nomura Asset Management, Japan's top fund manager,
was the most popular fund in June, drawing about 40.5 billion
yen.

 * Commodity-linked currencies under pressure
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, July 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was trading near a
six-week low against a basket of currencies on Monday, while the
euro held broad gains as investors bailed out of short positions
in the single currency and unwound leveraged trades.
 Traders said the short-squeeze in the euro is likely to
continue, with attention turning to a slowdown in the United
States and away from the euro zone's banking and government debt
woes.
 All leveraged trades funded in the euro, be it long U.S.
dollar, commodity currencies or emerging markets, were being cut.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was steady at $1.2550, having
posted a bullish outside week reversal, with near term support
seen around its 55-day moving which is currently at $1.2531. Last
week, the euro gained 1.5 percent against the dollar, reversing a
loss from the previous week.
 ""We are seeing all those leveraged trades funded in the euro
being cut as the focus of the market shifts to fears of a
'double-dip' recession in the U.S. from the funding concerns in

Westpac, Sydney.
 ""The yields at which the U.S. 10-year Treasuries are trading

 U.S. yields have fallen sharply in recent sessions after a

around 83.20, the 38.2 percent retracement of the index's move
from a low of 74.17 on November 26 to a high of 88.71 on June 7.
Trade was expected to be quiet with U.S. closed for a holiday.
 The dollar was steady against the yen  87.71, but could
come under pressure as speculators were cutting long dollar
positions and building positions in the yen on the back of
increasingly soft data out of the U.S.
 Latest data from the Currency Futures Trading Commission
showed net long yen positions jumped in the week to June 29. The
value of the dollar's net long position slipped to about $9.5
billiion in the week ended June 29, from $12.2 billion in the
prior week. 
 The dollar had hit a seven-month low on Thursday with option
triggers seen below 85 yen, traders said.
 Meanwhile, commodity-linked currencies like the Australian

704,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2010 11:20AM ET</span>",France combining spending cuts and growth -Lagarde," AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France, July 4 (Reuters) - France is not
choosing either austerity measures to cut its debt and deficit
or measures to boost economic growth but is doing both, Economy
Minister Christine Lagarde said on Sunday.
 She even coined a new word for it, ""rilance"", a combination
of ""rigueur"" for rigour and ""relance"" for growth.
 Her neologism adds a new dimension to a debate on how the
government eschews talk of rigour to avoid parallels being drawn
between its austerity drive and the deep spending cuts
implemented after a U-turn by President Francois Mitterand in
1983.
 The French government has pledged to cut the public deficit
from 8 percent of GDP this year to 3 percent in 2013.
 ""Rigour or growth is not a choice; it is not a Gordian
knot,"" Lagarde told a conference here.
 ""The economic policy that we implement in France ... is a
subtle dosage of taking responsibilities in an extremely
difficult situation ... and where we let the rest of the growth
plan work through while raising financing for the big
strategies,"" she said.
 She said there would be measures to boost investment and
innovation, citing changes to corporate taxes and tax credits
for innovation.
 European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet told the
conference that he had no problems with the word rigour.
 ""We are in a period where we have to manage very carefully
all the budgets,"" he told reporters. ""Call that rigour? I have
no problem with that. Austerity? I call that good budget
management,"" he added.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2010 10:40AM ET</span>",HK's Yam sees yuan as 3rd global currency in time," BEIJING, July 4 (Reuters) - Only China's yuan could rank
with the dollar and euro as pillars of the global monetary
system, given time and five key tests, Hong Kong's former
Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam was quoted as saying.
 Yam, now vice-president of the China Society for Finance and
Banking, a thinktank under the People's Bank of China, told
China's state-run Xinhua news agency in an interview carried on
Sunday that the international monetary system needed a ""third
leg"", and the yuan, also known as the renminbi, was the only
candidate among national currencies.
 The two existing legs, the dollar and euro, did not command
the level of international confidence needed to sustain their
status, leaving the system structurally unstable.
""If the third leg falls in the form of a sovereign currency,
it must be the renminbi,"" he said.
 Other, non-sovereign options for a third leg were the
Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund or a
new Asian Currency Unit, but few economies were willing to use
the former and few would trust the latter after recent wobbles
in the euro.
 Yam said recent moves by the PBOC, China's central bank, to
make the currency more flexible showed it was pushing forward
with gradual internationalisation of the currency.
 But there were five criteria to meet before it could serve
as a third leg of the world's monetary system: size, economic
strength, convertibility, an extensive yuan-denominated market
and a modern settlement system.
 Convertibility could only be achieved slowly, he said.
 ""The full liberalisation of the capital account has wider
ramifications than the internationalisation of the renminbi and
will therefore have to be handled carefully, emphasising on
gradualism, controllability and the ability to take the
initiative.""
 In terms of size, China's economy would need to be similar
to that of the U.S. and eurozone. China's gross domestic
product, at $5 trillion in 2009, was only about a third of the
size of the U.S. and eurozone economies.
 Yam said China could further develop yuan-denominated
business in Hong Kong by setting up an architecture to enable
the on-shore impact of off-shore activities to be monitored
closely, allowing Hong Kong to manage yuan business in its own
ways as long as the risks were controllable, and enhancing the
mobility of yuan between the two markets.

 * Iraq repairs continue
 * No timeframe for restored flow

(Adds detail, background)
 KIRKUK, Iraq/DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, July 4 (Reuters) - A bomb
planted by suspected PKK separatist rebels in Turkey and a
technical fault in Iraq have halted pumping on the Kirkuk to
Ceyhan pipeline, officials said on Sunday.
 The bombing by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) added a new
dimension to the threats against the pipeline, which carries
around a quarter of Iraq's oil exports, after the rebel group
called off a 14-month ceasefire in June.
 The explosion late on Saturday took place near the town of
Midyat in Mardin province, near the border with Syria, Turkish
security sources said. Crew workers from Turkey's state-run
pipeline operator BOTAS were working on Sunday to repair the
pipeline so that pumping can resume.
 On the Iraqi side of the border, a technical problem on the
pipeline that halted pumping late on Thursday was taking longer
to fix than expected, sources at Iraq's North Oil Co said.
 Iraqi oil officials said a technical team was continuing the
maintenance and repair works, but gave no further details about
when they expected to restore the flow of oil.
 The 960 km (600 mile) pipeline carries an average 500,000
barrels of oil per day from Iraq's northern oilfields around
Kirkuk to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, where it is
loaded onto tankers for export.
 Sabotage and technical problems kept the Iraq-Turkey route
mostly idle until 2007 following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of
Iraq.
 Security has improved but insurgents still target the
pipeline from time to time, and it also suffers frequent
technical issues because of its age and poor maintenance over
the years.
 Attacks on the Turkish side of the border had to date been
far less common.
 In recent weeks, the PKK has stepped up attacks on the
Turkish military after ending the ceasefire.

 AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France, July 4 (Reuters) - Euro zone growth
in 2010 could be ""closer to zero"" after a volatile second
quarter threatens to dash previous estimates of 1 percent, U.S.
economist Nouriel Roubini said on Sunday.
 The currency bloc does not face a double-dip recession,
however, despite deteriorating financial-market confidence over
economic growth in an age of fiscal austerity, Roubini told a
conference in Aix-en-Provence.
 ""Given the shocks of the last few month s... by year-end,
euro zone growth could be closer to zero percent,"" said Roubini,
who has been nicknamed ""Doctor Doom"" for his pessimistic
forecasts.
 He said his previous estimate of 1 percent was similar to
forecasts by the European Central Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
 The past three months' stock-market correction, rising
credit spreads and a jittery inter-bank lending market suggested
there were serious concerns over economic growth at a global
level, said Roubini.
 Growth in the U.S. economy could slow in the second half of
this year to 1.5 percent from 3 percent in the first, he said.
 ""For the global economy, by year-end, the picture is not a
very nice one,"" said Roubini.

(Adds Dexia comments)
 AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France, July 4 (Reuters) - The result of
tests designed to show that Europe's banks are able to cope with
further economic and other shocks will be published on July 23,
French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Sunday.
 Europe's banking watchdogs have been running the stress
tests to boost confidence in the sector as it emerges from the
financial crisis to face mounting pressure from tighter capital
requirements, extra taxes and additional regulation.
 ""You will soon be seeing the number of banks that will be
submitted to the stress test, you will have better understanding
of the exact criteria we apply and of how heavily we stress the
system, and then later on July 23rd, the result of the stress
test will be issued,"" Lagarde told reporters on the sidelines of
a conference.
 ""And you will see that banks in Europe are solid and
healthy,"" she added. Asked about French banks, she said: ""I'm
not worried about my banks.""
 Simulated tests carried out by analysts showed KBC, National
Bank of Greece, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole and Dexia fared
more poorly than big rivals, but without falling to danger
levels.
 Dexia chief executive Pierre Mariani said the bank received
details about the tests recently.
 ""The criteria upon which the stress tests are to be based
were communicated to us at the end of the week,"" Mariani told
Reuters. ""We are examining them.""
 Mariani declined to comment on the details of the criteria,
nor would he say how Dexia might fare.
 Banking regulators have already been testing the resilience
of 25 big EU lenders to an economic downturn and rising loan
losses. Sources have told Reuters that the tests will be
expanded to more than 100 across the region, with the tests also
covering risks from banks' sovereign debt holdings.

restore confidence in the sector and lead to a recapitalisation

717,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2010 04:56AM ET</span>",Belgian EU presidency wants bank tax deal-minister," MILAN, July 4 (Reuters) - Belgium, which took over the
European Union's six-month presidency on July 1, wants an EU
deal on a bank tax by the end of the year, Finance Minister
Didier Reynders said in a newspaper interview on Sunday.
 The bloc is considering a levy on banks to insure them
against the cost of any future bailout and is also studying a
financial transaction tax, even though G20 leaders failed to
agree on either plan in June.
 ""We are pushing for a political agreement by the end of the
year,"" Reynders told Italy's La Stampa newspaper when asked
about his plans for a bank tax.
 ""If we are talking about financial transactions, we believe
this ought to concentrate on ultra-rapid movements that don't
generate real value such as short-selling,"" said Reynders,
finance minister in the outgoing government. Coalition talks are
under way following last month's parliamentary election.
 A transaction tax ought not to touch traditional savings
such as bank deposits, he said.
 In addition, there is a need for caution over imposing new
taxes on banks, given the arrival of new requirements under
international Basel 3 capital rules.
 ""We can go and hit banks on their own funds but let's not
forget that it is banks that finance the economy. There needs to
be a balance,"" he said.
 EU leaders told their finance ministers in May to work out
details of the banking levy. The EU's executive has said it will
study the financial transaction tax. [ID:nLDE65R1EV]
 On EU economic governance, Reynders said this had to protect
jobs as well as the environment.
 On public debt and deficits, he said stability pact rules
had to be applied with the same rigour to all EU states and
sanctions must be made more automatic.
 Reynders said he opposed taking away EU agricultural funds
from states which did not obey EU public finance rules. The
European Commission has proposed such a plan.

 * Accuses Russia of lies in the latest gas dispute
 
 MINSK, July 3 (Reuters) - Belarus's combative leader
Alexander Lukashenko said on Saturday his government had
ratified all documents to set up a trade pact sought by Russia
while accusing Moscow of ""lies"" in the latest gas dispute.
 Lukashenko, a former top ally of the Kremlin on Russia's
western flank who has since become one of Moscow's harshest
critics, has dramatically raised the stakes during the latest
dispute over gas pricing with Moscow last month.
 Russia triggered the row by saying it would halt gas to
Minsk over a relatively small amount of debt for gas supplies.
 Analysts have said the move was meant to punish Lukashenko,
criticised in the West for authoritarian rule, for not joining a
customs union with Russia and Kazakhstan and for giving refuge
to a former Kyrgyz president.
 Lukashenko retaliated by saying Russia owed Minsk more money
and threatened to halt Russian oil and gas transit flows to
Europe, reviving EU memories of similar cuts of the past years
which have tarnished Russia's image as a reliable supplier.
 The dispute was resolved when Moscow and Minsk repaid debts
to each other and signed a new gas transit deal.
 Last week, Russia and Kazakhstan launched their customs
union in the first step towards creating of an ex-Soviet common
market for 160 million people, a plan that has sparked criticism
from the West over protectionism.
 Russia said the door was still open for Belarus despite the
recent dispute but Lukashenko said on Saturday Minsk had
ratified all documents.
 ""I must tell you that as far as the customs union is
concerned, we are not behind Russia or Kazakhstan even by half a
step or by a millimetre,"" Lukashenko said.
 He repeatedly attacked Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom
and Russian state media for their coverage of the latest gas
crisis.
 ""What we have seen recently were huge lies about what was
going on with debts. No one said that Gazprom owed us more,""
said Lukashenko. Gazprom had long denied it owed money to
Belarus but later said Minsk had blocked its payments.
 ""They (in Russia) are rudely but professionally falsifying
everything we say and make us look like idiots. Do they expect
me to be silent?"" he asked.
 Belarus will hold presidential elections next year and
Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, has pledged to
keep raising state wages and salaries. 
 That leaves him vulnerable to Moscow, which has begun
scrapping subsidised energy exports to its neighbours.
 Russia's energy subsidies to Belarus amount to $7 billion a
year as Minsk pays the lowest price among Russian gas customers.
 Minsk has bridled at recent increases, saying it should pay
less if Moscow is serious about closer ties. Lukashenko has also
courted the West and sought other energy sources.

 * Miklos served as finance minister from 2002-2006
 * Earned reputation as fiscal conservative
 * New centre-right government aims to fight deficit
 
(Adds completion of coalition talks, Radicova comment)
 By Martin Santa
 BRATISLAVA, July 3 (Reuters) - The four centre-right parties
which together won a majority in Slovakia's June 12 election
agreed on Saturday to form a coalition, with fiscal hawk Ivan
Miklos returning as finance minister.
 Miklos, expected to take a hard line on the deficit after
earning a reputation as a market reformist during a previous
stint in the job, was nominated earlier on Saturday by the
incoming Prime Minister Iveta Radicova.
 Both are from the strongest centre-right party the SDKU, led
by ex-Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda, who will become foreign
minister in the new government.
 The conservative SDKU, Christian Democrats (KDH), the
liberal Freedom and Solidarity party (SaS), and the ethnic
Hungarian Most-Hid party are expected to be sworn in on July 8,
ousting the leftist cabinet of Prime Minister Robert Fico.
 ""SDKU, SaS, KDH and Most-Hid have reached an agreement on
the coalition deal,"" Radicova told reporters after meeting with
her partners. ""All issues have been solved.""
 Miklos, 50, previously served in the post from 2002-06, when
he oversaw the introduction of a 19 percent flat tax and helped
prepare the country to join the euro zone last year.
 He will have to tackle a large fiscal deficit and massive
drop in tax revenue, while carrying out fiscal consolidation as
requested by the European Commission.
 ""Miklos points toward fiscal consolidation. He has earned
credit in the past, when the public-finance deficit shrank under
his management as finance minister. And also thanks to his
effort, Slovakia was able adopt the euro,"" analyst Maria
Valachyova at bank Slovenska Sporitelna said.
 ""The government's plan to bring public finances back to a
sustainable trend will be very important for the market.""
 Fico's outgoing centre-left government abandoned the
original fiscal gap ceiling of 5.5 percent on GDP set for this
year, down from 6.8 percent in 2009, due to unfavourable
budgetary trends.
 The finance ministry's latest estimate saw the fiscal gap at
7 percent and the new coalition has pledged to cut the budget
deficit, with Miklos saying it was possible to bring it below 2
percent of GDP by 2014.
 
 CONSOLIDATION WITHOUT TOUGH AUSTERITY
 The 63 billion euro ($77 billion) economy, heavily
export-reliant, should rise by more than 3 percent this year,
after a 4.7 percent contraction in 2009, but even strong growth
will provide only limited relief to weak budget revenue.
With Miklos as finance minister, the incoming cabinet plans
to adopt a constitutional law on a balanced budget in a mid-term
period and pursue a gradual fiscal tightening, but does not
intend to increase the overall tax burden or add new taxes.
 Analysts said no tough austerity measures were needed to
cope with an unfavourable fiscal situation, due to a relatively
small size of public debt. But they urged reforms of the pension
system, labour market and tax system.
 The euro zone's poorest member has a public debt load of
35.7 percent of gross domestic product -- half the EU average
but rising rapidly.
 The centre-right parties have not shed light on how fast
they plan to consolidate or when the EU's official fiscal limit
should be met. Radicova said they will support Brussels's plan
to tighten the Stability Pact rules.
 Miklos, however, is strictly against a bilateral loan, worth
around 800 million euro, to debt-laden Greece and regards the
750-billion-euro European safety net as a bad idea.
 The new government seeks no privatisation, as seen under the
second rule of Dzurinda, but will allow foreign investors to
acquire stakes in remaining major state-run companies.

 NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - The dollar, crude oil and U.S.
equities fell on Friday after a weak U.S. jobs report rekindled
doubts about the strength of recovery yet failed to confirm
widespread fears the economy is dipping back into recession.
 The price of safe-haven U.S. Treasuries slipped after many
investors concluded the jobs report was not as bad as had been
feared, leading to a mild bout of profit-taking. For details see:

dropped out of the labor force, but a modest rise in private

 ""With all the gloom and doom before the report, you could say it
wasn't as bad as it could have been, but it's probably not a positive
for the economy,"" said Robert Yawger, senior vice president, energy
futures at MF Global in New York.
 ON WALL ST, WORST WEEK IN 2 MONTHS
 U.S. stocks posted their worst week in two months on the jobs
data and a report that showed new orders for U.S. factory products
dropped by the sharpest since the depth of the recession and fell for
the first time in nine months.
 A technical move that suggested more selling pressure may be
ahead also weighed on U.S. stocks. The S&P 500's 50-day moving
average broke below its 200-day moving average, a development known
as the ""death cross.""
 Volume on Friday was among the worst five days of the trading
year, with many participants leaving early for the long Fourth of
July holiday weekend.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed down 46.05 points,
or 0.47 percent, at 9,686.48. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX>

 ""What seems to be happening is that people are a bit less worried
now about the idea the U.S. economy is already sliding into a
double-dip recession,"" Julian Jessop, fixed-income strategist at
Capital Economics, said about the data.
 OIL FALLS, DOLLAR DROPS VS EURO
 U.S. crude oil prices fell a fifth straight day to a three-week
low on the bearish U.S. economic data.
 U.S. crude oil futures  slipped 81 cents, or 1.11 percent,
to settle at $72.14 a barrel, the weakest close since June 8.
 ICE Brent crude oil futures  fell 69 cents, or 0.95
percent, to settle at $71.65, the weakest close since May 25.
 Gold prices rebounded on technical strength and bargain hunting
after double-dip recession fears triggered the biggest losses in six
weeks on Thursday.
 Gold was supported by a stronger euro against the dollar before
the long U.S. Independence Day weekend.
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery settled $1 higher at
$1,207.70 an ounce, but ended the week nearly 4 percent lower.
 U.S. bond prices were mixed. The benchmark 10-year note
 was down 9/32 in price to yield 2.98 percent. The 2-year
U.S. Treasury note  was flat at 0.63 percent.
 ""The uncertain response in bonds suggests the employment report
was a difficult read. There's a lot of mixed data in there,"" said Kim

steep losses, on concerns about the U.S. recovery. [ID:nN02233138]

instead on the possibility of a stalled U.S. recovery.

 NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped
against the euro on Friday, extending the previous day's steep
losses on concerns over the U.S. economic recovery after
disappointing U.S. jobs data.
 U.S. private payrolls rose less than expected in June and
overall employment fell for the first time this year as
thousands of temporary census jobs ended, indicating the
economic recovery is failing to gain traction.
 The euro rallied sharply against the dollar this week as
investors looked past economic problems in the euro zone and
instead focused on the possibility of a stalled economic
recovery in the United States.
 The jobs report ""reinforces the market's view that the U.S.
recovery is losing steam,"" said Greg Salvaggio, vice president
of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2545, up 0.2
percent. The single currency rose as high as $1.2613, according
to Reuters data, the first time over the 1.2600 level since May
21. On Thursday, the euro surged more than 2 percent in its
biggest one-day advance since March last year.
 For the week, the euro gained 1.4 percent against the
dollar, reversing a loss from the previous week. It remained
down 12.4 percent year-to-date.
 Friday's U.S. jobs report follows weak housing and
manufacturing data, and a rise in initial jobless claims on
Thursday and weak consumer confidence data earlier in the week.
""There is a very good chance that U.S. fundamentals are
finally catching up with the dollar,"" said Kathy Lien, director
of currency research at GFT in New York. ""Traders have trashed
the euro because of the European fiscal crisis and now they are
turning on the U.S. dollar. If this becomes a new trend, we
could see steeper losses in the greenback.""
 The dollar was last at 87.80 yen, up 0.2 percent, after
hitting a seven-month low on Thursday. Japanese exporter offers
were likely to emerge in the low 88-yen range, a dealer at a
Japanese bank said. Option triggers were seen below 85 yen,
traders said.
 The dollar fell for the fourth straight week against the
yen, losing an additional 1.7 percent and bringing the total
loss over the four weeks to 4.4 percent.
 BULLISH BREAK
 The euro had already gained momentum as concerns eased
about euro-zone liquidity problems after a lower take-up of
European Central Bank funding and successful Spanish bond
auctions on Thursday.
 Adding to positive sentiment, banking and regulatory
sources said on Thursday that no German bank is in acute danger
from a probe into the health of Europe's lenders. Europe's
banking watchdogs have an end-of-July deadline to publish the
test results. See
 Strategists at Citigroup said a close above $1.2490 in the
euro/dollar on Friday will ""complete the bullish outside week""
and a close above the 55-day moving average at $1.2550 will
""confirm the bullish break.""
 ""If achieved, these patterns would strongly suggest that
the next significant directional move in euro/dollar will be up
to $1.31,"" they wrote in a note.
 Some analysts, however, remained cautious about the single
currency ahead of a Greek T-bill issue due later this month and
stress test results of a wider group of 100 banks that include
German and Spanish regional banks.
 The Australian dollar climbed as high as $0.8510 after the
Australian government agreed to a watered-down version of a

percent.

 NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Global stocks eased and crude oil
fell on Friday after reports on U.S. manufacturing and payrolls data
were worse than expected, adding to worries that economic growth
appears tepid at best in the near future.
 The price of German Bund futures fell while European shares pared
early strong gains but still ended higher as a U.S. employment report
failed to live up to grim expectations, relieving some fears of a
U.S. double-dip recession. For details see: [ID:nLDE6611OA]
 A string of disappointing reports on consumer spending, the
housing market and factory activity has fueled forecasts that the
U.S. economy is slipping back into a recession.
 U.S. private payrolls rose only modestly in June and overall
employment fell for the first time this year as thousands of
temporary jobs with the U.S. Census ended, suggesting the economic
recovery is failing to gain traction.
 Another government report showed new orders for U.S. factory

 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top shares

lost 4.3 percent.
 ""There was palpable relief over today's payrolls data,"" said
Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. ""We subsequently got

 WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - The number of Americans
filing new claims for jobless aid hit the lowest level in more
than 2-1/2 years last week and service sector hiring picked up

 Another report on Thursday confirmed business productivity
picked up a bit in the fourth quarter, but it also underscored
a slowing trend that suggested employers may have to step-up

 Another report on Thursday confirmed a slowdown in business
productivity in the fourth quarter of 2010, suggesting
employers may have to step-up hiring even further.
 ""There can be no denial that a strengthening in labor
market conditions is under way, as layoffs have dropped sharply
since the beginning of the year,"" said Jim Baird, a partner at
Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
 Initial claims for state jobless benefits dropped 20,000 to
368,000, the lowest since May 2008, the Labor Department said.
 Economists had forecast claims rising to 398,000. The
four-week average of claims, a better measure of underlying
trends, fell below 400,000 for first time since July 2008.
 Separately, growth in the huge U.S. services sector touched

 The Institute for Supply Management's index of
non-manufacturing activity edged up to 59.7, the highest since
August 2005, from 59.4 in January. Its employment component

 PAYROLLS SEEN BOUNCING BACK
 The jobless claims data fell outside the survey period for
the U.S. government's closely watched jobs report for February
due on Friday. But economists said it was consistent with other
recent signs that the labor market recovery was quickening.
 Total nonfarm payrolls probably increased 185,000 after
snowstorms held growth to a paltry 36,000 jobs in January,
according to a Reuters survey. The survey was conducted before
data on Tuesday that showed strong factory hiring, which
prompted some economists to rethink their forecasts.
 Despite six straight quarters of growth, the economy has
only managed to replace a fraction of the more than 8 million
jobs lost during the recession. But analysts are optimistic job
growth will soon top 150,000 a month on a sustained basis.
 ""That amount of payroll growth is sufficient to give the
economy escape velocity -- whereby a self-reinforcing cycle of
increases in production, income, and spending is in place,""
said Tony Crescenzi, a portfolio manager at PIMCO in Newport
Beach in California.
 Fewer layoffs and gains in new jobs should help the economy
weather a rise crude oil prices to over $100 a barrel in the
past month in the wake of unrest in the Middle East.
 Reports from U.S. retailers suggested consumers were
withstanding the jump in gasoline prices. Luxury retailer Saks
Inc  and Victoria's Secret parent Limited Brands Inc
 were among those reporting the biggest gains in sales.
 However, discounter Target Corp  and Gap Inc 
missed analysts' forecasts. For details see [ID:nN03203429]
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said this week that
high oil prices were unlikely to hurt the domestic economy
unless they were sustained. For details see [ID:nN01145792]
 Economists agree and expect the Fed to complete its $600
billion government bond-buying program which aims in part to
lower a jobless rate that stood at 9.0 percent in January.
Economists expect the rate rose to 9.1 percent last month.
 A second report from the Labor Department on Thursday said
nonfarm productivity increased at an unrevised 2.6 percent
annual rate in the fourth quarter, which marks a sharp slowdown
from a peak of 8.9 percent in the second quarter of 2009.
 Unit labor costs, a gauge of potential inflation pressures,
fell at an unrevised 0.6 percent rate.
 The drop in labor costs, which account for about 70 percent
of production costs, showed the economy was facing little
inflation pressure outside of globally driven increases in food
and energy costs.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped against the
euro on Friday, extending the previous day's steep losses on concerns
over the U.S. economic recovery after disappointing U.S. jobs data.
 U.S. private payrolls rose less than expected in June and overall
employment fell for the first time this year as thousands of
temporary Census jobs ended, indicating the economic recovery is
failing to gain traction.
 The euro gained against the dollar as investors looked past
economic problems in the euro zone and instead focused on the
possibility of a stalled economic recovery in the United States.
 ""What this does is, it reinforces the market's view that the U.S.
recovery is losing steam,"" said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of
trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""There's a growing concern in the marketplace right now that
previously the U.S. was thought to be the economy which was going to
drive forward, regardless of events happening elsewhere in the
world,"" Salvaggio added. ""Now there are some very, very serious
concerns that the U.S. recovery is beginning to stumble.""
 Friday's U.S. jobs report follows weak housing and manufacturing
data on Thursday and weak consumer confidence data earlier in the
week.
 In early New York trade, the euro last traded at $1.2591 on
electronic trading platform EBS, up 0.6 percent on the day. The
single currency rose as high as $1.2613 -- the first time over the
1.2600 level since May 21.
""We are at a phase at the moment when the dollar reacts negatively
to poor U.S. data, which we have quite a lot recently,"" said Tom
Levinson, currency strategist at ING in London.
 The euro was already bolstered by easing concerns about euro-zone
liquidity problems after a lower take-up of European Central Bank
funding and successful bond auctions on Thursday.
 On Thursday, the euro surged more than 2.0 percent in its biggest
one-day advance since mid-March last year. However, some analysts
remained cautious about the single currency ahead of European bank
stress test results and a Greek T-bill issue due later this month.
 MINING TAX
 The Australian dollar  rose for the second straight day,
climbing as high as $0.8510, before paring gains to trade at $0.8457,
up 0.3 percent for the day, and also rose against the yen after the
Australian government agreed to a watered-down version of a proposed
mining tax, easing concerns the tax would hurt business investment.
 ""The Australian dollar was buoyed by a mining tax deal reached in
that country,"" said TJ Marta, chief market strategist at Marta on the
Markets, in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.
 The dollar was last at 87.77 yen on EBS, up 0.2 percent for the
day.
 On Thursday, the greenback hit a seven-month low against the yen.
Japanese exporter offers were likely to emerge in the low 88-yen
range, a dealer at a Japanese bank said.
 One-month implied volatility for dollar/yen pulled back to around
12.2 percent  from around 14 percent on Thursday.
 Option triggers were seen below 85 yen, traders said.
 Last November, the dollar hit a 14-year low against the yen.
 The dollar fell for the fourth straight week against the yen,
losing an additional 1.7 percent and bringing the total loss over the
four weeks to 4.5 percent.
 For the week, the euro gained 1.8 percent against the dollar,
reversing a loss from the previous week.

 * Large number of downgrades not foreseen
 * Italian banks have lower capitalisation, lower risks

(Adds details, background)
 By Gianluca Semeraro
 MILAN, July 2 (Reuters) - Italian banks passed a simulated
basic stress test and would only need to boost capital if they
suffered extreme loan losses, Moody's analysts said on Friday.
 Among the five biggest banks, Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena and Banco Popolare could need capital in a worst-case
scenario, Carlo Gori, Moody's vice president and senior bank
analyst, told Reuters in an interview.
 He said the base case called for loan losses equal to 3
percent of the total.
 The worst-case scenario put loan losses at about 7.5 percent
but Gori said this was far from the situation for Italian banks.
An analyst told Reuters that Italian bank loan losses on average
were around 1 percent.
 ""For the base case in general the capitalisation is enough,""
Gori said.
 Moody's joined a number of financial analysts who have run
simulations on banks as the European Union puts a large number
of lenders through stress tests.
 EU regulators planned to test 25 big cross-border banks with
the goal of reassuring markets about the health of the banking
system. The EU executive and the European Central Bank are
pressing countries to boost the number to more than 100.
 
 LOWER CAPITALISATION, LOWER RISKS
 ""Today the level of Italian capitalisation is a little bit
less than in other big (banking) systems but the risks are lower
as well,"" Henry MacNevin, Moody's senior vice president and team
leader, said in the interview.
 ""The important thing is that the banks continue to be
focused on reinforcement (of capital) or at least maintaining
these levels.""
 However, Italian banks have no pressing need to deal with
large risks or bailouts as in other countries, he said.
 The Financial Times reported on Friday that cooperative
lender Banca Popolare di Milano might need to boost capital. The
bank said in a statement it had not taken part in a stress test
at a European level and had no need to boost its capital base.
 Moody's outlook on Italian banks will remain negative until
at least the beginning of 2011 even though a large number of
downgrades is unlikely, MacNevin said.
 ""I wouldn't expect more downgrades like last year when we
downgraded 20 banks during the summer. At the system level, the
banks are well positioned,"" he said.
 The main cause of the negative outlook is the fragility of
the economy, the euro zone's third-biggest, as it recovers from
its worst recession since World War Two.
 The analysts also said they expect bank profits to hit a
bottom in 2010 as well as slightly more bad loans and
provisions.

 NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Global stocks and crude oil
prices held steady on Friday while safe-haven government debt
slipped after U.S. payrolls data came out worse than expected
but not as grim as to clearly signal a double-dip recession lay
ahead.
 European shares pared early gains and oil was little
changed after overall U.S. employment in June fell for the
first time this year as thousands of temporary census jobs
ended, showing the economic recovery is failing to gain

 U.S. payrolls dropped by 125,000 -- the largest decline

83,000 after increasing only 33,000 the prior month, the U.S.

Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts said about the U.S.
employment report.
 ""Has it slowed so much to drive us into a double dip? I
think probably not. But clearly we're looking at weak growth in
the third quarter,"" Gault said.
 MSCI's all-country world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.4 percent, while its emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> gained

 Bond prices see-sawed before losing ground as traders
scrutinized the payrolls data, which also showed a fall in the
unemployment rate as discouraged workers dropped out of the
labor force.
 Some traders had bet on an even worse result, making the
actual showing not so bad by comparison and limiting the upside
to Treasury prices.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 7/32 in price to yield 2.98 percent.
 The euro gained against the U.S. dollar as investors looked
past economic problems in the euro zone and instead focused on
the possibility of a stalled economic recovery in the United
States.
 ""The data that we are seeing this week in the U.S. and in
China is causing extra nervousness among investors, which
probably is a bit exaggerated,"" said William de Vijlder, chief

733,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2010 10:00AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Pricing for double-dip," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - With the global economy slowing,
interest rates about as low as they can go, governments getting
austere and banks being investigated for stress, it is getting
harder for investors to keep putting on their bullish faces.
 Heading into the first full week of the second half,
investors are still committed to riskier assets such as equities
and high-yield bonds in their portfolios, but are being battered
with questions about whether this is the right stance.
 Reuters asset alloction polls for June showed investors
cutting stocks a bit, but retaining a long-held overweight bias
towards them.
 They also moved into the riskier end of bonds, seeking
yield.
 But markets themselves are telling another story.
 After a brief rally early last month, world stocks have
fallen almost steadily. What was shaping up to be a gain on
Friday was only the second up day in nine sessions that have
seen stocks lose around 8 percent.
 At the same time, bond yields are painting a picture of deep
concern about the future. Citi's composite world bond yield is
only 1.8 percent, while short-term U.S. and euro zone yields
are only 0.6 percent.
 ""There is growing concern over the possibility of a
double-dip recession in developed markets,"" said Rob Carnell,
chief international economist at ING Commerical Banking.
 ""In consequence, people want to keep their money as liquid
as possible in case things start to turn down.""
 Just about everything has been turning down from bond
yields, to stocks, economic indicators and the Baltic Freight
Index, a proxy for world trade.
 Friday's U.S. jobs data will have done nothing to ease
concerns, given that private employment gains were less than
expected and that jobs are a lagging indicator.
 
 ARMAGEDDON?
 There are two implications from this. Either investors
banking on a stock revival are wrongly positioned or bond yields
are wrong pricing in something approaching an investment and
economic Armageddon.
 Fred Goodwin, the ""Mr Macro"" analyst at a Nomura, leans to
the latter. He says that once a recovery has begun to take hold,
as now, double-dip recessions are very rare. The one in 1980-82,
he reckons, only came about after the Federal Reserve had raised
interest rates closer to 10 percent.
 ""Positioning (now) for the double-dip, a Japan scenario, or a
Depression does not offer compelling risk-reward at these
levels of bond yields,"" Goodwin said in a note.
 Others are similarly unimpressed by the idea that another
recession is on the way, particularly when it comes to corporate
earnings performance, the main driver behind stock movements.
 ""A number of factors have been in place preceding previous
global earnings recessions including an inverted global yield
curve, excess inventories and unsustainably high profitability.
None of these factors are apparent now,"" Citi equity strategists
said in a note.
 That said, it is hard to see where investors would find
grounds to be bullish if the current recovery slowdown --
epitomised by the lastest manufacturing surveys -- starts gain
momentum.
 Reliance on Chinese and other emerging market growth could
hardly be guaranteed if their main commercial markets started to
retrench.
 And deflation fears are growing enough to prompt investors
such as those at HSBC's absolute returns team to buy 25- and
30-year bonds. They want to grab a near 4 percent yield they
expect will soon fall as demand drives the price higher.

 STRESS
 The week ahead is not likely to offer much that will help
investors make up their minds about the future.
 The Bank of England and European Central Bank hold separate
meetings, but both are likely to keep interest rates on hold.
 Germany will also auction some 10-year Bunds on Wednesday.
Some auctions have been disappointing because record low yields
have put people off.
 But this auction is expected to attract plenty of buyers
because of a massive amount of cash that will be returned to
Bund investor the same week from other maturing German issues.
 Austria might provide a better stress test, when it auctions
1.3 billion euros of benchmark bonds on Tuesday. The country is
highly exposed to debt-stricken Hungary and is seen by markets
as riskier than Germany and other core euro zone sovereigns.
 Investors, meanwhile, will also be looking for any early
results from the European Commission's stress tests on European
banks, designed to see how they would cope with crises.
 Results for some of the biggest banks will be given to EU
finance ministers on July 13 but leaks or announcements could
come before then, especially about German regional and Spanish
savings banks.

*Russia will pay Belarus close to 30 percent more for gas
transit
*Belarus to pay $193-$194 in Q3 for 1,000 cubic metres of gas
 
 (Adds details, prices background)
 MINSK, July 2 (Reuters) - Belarus and Russia on Friday
signed a contract on new fees for Russian gas transit to Europe,
resolving the last outstanding issue from last month's gas row,
which had threatened to cut energy supplies to the EU.
 Gazprom, Russia's gas export monopoly, agreed with
Belarussian pipeline operator Beltransgaz on a new transit
tariff of $1.88 for shipments of 1,000 cubic metres of gas
through 100 kilometres of pipeline.
 For Europe, gas rows between Moscow and its Western
neighbours are an issue of energy security, given that Russia
supplyies more than 20 percent of the EU's gas needs.
Four-fifths of that flows via Ukraine and one-fifth via Belarus.
 The dispute over gas payments and transit debts triggered a
four-day stand-off between the ex-Soviet states last week and
resulted in Russia's cutting gas supplies to Belarus, which in
turn halted onward transit to EU countries Poland and Lithuania.
 Russia triggered the row last month when it said Belarus
owed it around $200 million for gas deliveries, accusing its
neighbour of underpaying for supplies from the start of the year
and of ignoring the higher rates set for 2010.
 Supplies resumed after Minsk paid the bill, but Belarus
retaliated by threatening to cut off Russian flows to Europe if
Gazprom did not pay more for transit.
 The contract signed on Friday also settled the issue of
supply pricing, stipulating that Belarus pay Russia $169 per
1,000 cubic meters supplied in the first quarter of 2010; $185
for the second quarter; and $193-4 for the third quarter, up
from the $150 Belarus had been previously paying.
 Gazprom has a 50 percent stake in Beltransgaz, which it
acquired in 2007 in the wake of a similar gas pricing dispute
between the countries.

 * Tariff regime would help support EU manufacturers
 * Consumer advocates say measures would reduce choice
 
 By Juliane von Reppert-Bismarck
 BRUSSELS, July 2 (Reuters) - The European Union is set to
review import duties on Chinese-made bicycles and bicycle parts
and could extend punitive tariffs until 2016, EU diplomats say,
a move likely to aggravate EU-China trade relations.
 China exported nearly 700,000 bicycles and had total
bicycle-related exports to the EU worth 430 million euros ($526
million) last year, despite the EU imposing an anti-dumping duty
of 48.5 percent on the goods. 
 The duties, first imposed in 1993, have frustrated Chinese
attempts to gain greater market share in Europe, where sales of
bicycles and parts total around 5 billion euros a year.
 The duties have gradually been increased since first being
levied 17 years ago but the latest 48.5-percent regime, imposed
in 2005, is due to expire in mid-July.
 The European Bicycle Manufacturers Association (EBMA), which
represents an industry employing around 20,000 people, mostly in
Germany and Italy, has asked the EU's executive Commission to
extend the duties for a further five years.
 The Commission has until July 15 to reach a decision on
whether to launch a review of the regime, which could then lead
to a five-year extension of the tariffs, diplomats say. The
review itself could last up to 15 months.
 ""There's a lot of pressure from EU industry to keep the
duties in place,"" Richard Luff, a partner at Brussels-based law
firm Van Bael & Bellis, said on Friday.
 In its complaint, registered with the Commission this
spring, EBMA said allowing duties against Chinese imports to
expire would result in more dumping of bicyles and bicyle parts
by Chinese exporters, damaging Europe's industry.
 Europe produced more than 13 million bikes and 1.6 billion
euros worth of bike parts in 2008, according to industry group
Colibi. The average price of bicycles ranges from 680 euros in
the Netherlands to 100 euros in Europe's eastern states.
 European Commission officials said they could not comment on
the possibility of a review of the anti-dumping duties.
 
 BREAK FOR VIETNAM
 While duties on China look set to be extended, similar
tariffs levied on Vietnamese-made bicycles are expected to be
allowed to expire, a nod to slumping bike exports since the
duties were imposed and improved trade relations with Vietnam.
The EU and Vietnam are due to start talks on a free-trade
agreement later this year.
 Yet Vietnam's exclusion from renewed duties may not
immediately reinvigorate the country's bike export industry.
 ""You won't see a huge number of bicycles coming out of
Vietnam anymore, or anyone making big investments. It's too late
for that,"" said Jon Edwards, chief executive of Taiwan-owned
High Ride Bicycle, which moved its production from Vietnam to
Cambodia in the wake of the EU duties, levied in 2005.
 ""It shows a bit of the fallacy of dumping duties,"" he said.
""They don't really offer any protection to the EU. They only
made us move our production to a country that had never exported
a single bike to the EU.""
 An extension of the duties on China is likely to aggravate
EU relations with Beijing, already damaged by complaints over
imports of Chinese ceramic tiles, paper and wireless modems.
 It may also lead to tension between EU countries with high
bicycle production, such as Italy and Germany, and those
countries that produce few bicycles and would like to import
cheaper options from China, such as Britain.
 ""The principle here is that free trade is good for the
customer,"" said Alisdair Gray, director of the British Retail
Consortium in Brussels. 
 ""How are we meant to get kids away from their TV screens and
onto their bikes when we're making it unaffordable for so many
of them to even consider it?""
 The European Bicycles Manufacturers Association declined to
comment on its complaint.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2010 08:12AM ET</span>",German criticism hits bank stress tests - sources," By Arno Schuetze and Philipp Halstrick 
 HANOVER/FRANKFURT, July 2 (Reuters) - Rising criticism in
Germany over assumed potential ""haircuts"" for European bank
holdings of sovereign debt is complicating planned EU stress
tests, regulatory and financial sources told Reuters.
 German banks, backed by the Bundesbank, are balking at an
across-the-board approach that assigns the same risk weighting
to all government bonds, the sources said, whether they are
German, Greek or Spanish.
 This is a politically touchy subject and national central
banks do not necessarily agree with how Europe's Committee of
European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) and the European Central
Bank are conducting the tests, the sources said.
 ""German banks are resisting calls for including all
sovereign debt exposure in European stress tests for banks,"" one
executive said, adding he saw no reason to test holdings of
Germany's liquid and top-rated sovereign debt.
 German banks had expected to hear details of the stress
tests from Bundesbank President Axel Weber on Wednesday but were
disappointed, executives who attended the meeting in Frankfurt
said.
 Potential sovereign debt markdowns are supposed to be
included in European Union tests for more than 100 European
banks, in an effort to end a crisis of confidence that has
dragged down the global economy.
 But the renewed criticism may complicate the process ahead
of an end-of-July deadline to publish the results, with
regulators facing an arduous choice between diplomacy and being
robust enough to convince markets.
 If they take a global haircut as a scenario, German and
French banks will be disadvantaged because they have more or
less the same German and French bonds in their portfolio.
 
 CRUCIAL DECISION
 But if the regulators assign haircuts on bonds for
individual countries, markets will see it as the probability of
default EU regulators see for each country.
 The decision is crucial for the success of the stress tests,
whose assumptions need to be realistic enough to put investors'
minds at ease, without admitting too bluntly that regulators
seriously think a European country could default.
 There are massive differences between market prices for
sovereign debt across Europe, with investors currently demanding
a premium of 777 basis points to hold 10-year Greek government
debt over euro zone benchmark German Bunds.
 The spread between yields on Portuguese and Spanish paper
and the benchmark is 284 bps and 199 bps respectively.
 The cut-off date that will be used in the stress test is
likely to be a day before May 8, when Europe drew up a huge
rescue package for Greece, one financial source said.
 No German bank is in acute danger from a probe into the
health of Europe's lenders, banking and regulatory sources said
on Thursday, and there is enough cash available to fill any gaps
if the situation worsens.
 There is less data about Germany's landesbanks and Spain's
cajas and the fear is that many of Europe's biggest problems lie
with these smaller players.
 Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week that
the first three to be tested in Germany -- Deutsche Bank,
Commerzbank and landesbank BayernLB -- passed the initial tests.

 LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - The dollar dipped against a

and before the all-important June non-farm payrolls data.
By 1047 GMT, the dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its

 ING expected a fall in June non-farm payrolls of 250,000,
though economists polled by Reuters expected a decline of
110,000. It would be the first drop this year but mainly due to
the disappearance of temporary federal census-taking jobs.
 The Reuters survey showed private-sector hiring is forecast
to rise to 112,000, up from 41,000 in May, with the unemployment
rate inching up to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent the previous

 * Structural reforms in 2011-12 to cost money, boost growth
 * Banks withdraw from tax talks, govt submit bill -minister
 
 (Adds more comments, detail)
 By Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs
 BUDAPEST, July 2 (Reuters) - Hungary will seek a two-year
precautionary deal with the IMF and EU for 2011-12 in the range
of 10-20 billion euros and hopes to agree with lenders on a
higher budget gap than 3 percent of GDP for next year, the
Economy Minister said on Friday.
 Gyorgy Matolcsy also told Reuters that the country's leading
foreign-owned banks had pulled out of talks on a bank tax
targetted as a key source of state revenues, but the government
would push on with implementation anyway.
 The minister said his centre-right government, which swept
into power at April elections, was committed to this year's
budget deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP and plans to reduce
the gap further next year and in 2012.
 But he said the deep structural reforms which the government
is planning for 2011 and 2012 will have significant additional
costs, and the difficult situation of the euro zone economy
could also make deep deficit cuts hard next year.
 ""I think we should agree with our partners on a range of
between 3.0 and 3.8 percent (for 2011), undertaking very deep
serious structural reforms,"" Matolcsy said in an interview.
 ""This is the range for 2011 and I think that if we manage to
achieve this, then we can undertake a deficit of around 3
percent for 2012."" For more comments, see
 Hungary's budget deficit was projected to fall below 3
percent next year under its existing agreement with the IMF and
the EU. That 20 billion euro financing deal, which was signed in
Oct. 2008, will expire in October.
 Matolcsy said that after a consolidation of finances this
year, the period of 2011-12 will be dedicated to deep structural
reforms, which should help the economy return to fast growth and
sustainable financial balances from 2013 onwards.
 For this period, to serve as a safety net, the government
aims to sign a new precautionary deal with lenders for two
years.
 ""Our intention is that we extend the existing IMF/EU deal
until end of the year and from the beginning of next year we
continue with a 2-year precautionary agreement but in a way that
we signal that this is a different deal, not an urgency,"" he
said.
 Hungary will conduct talks with the lenders in two rounds,
starting next week, and resuming talks in the early autumn.
 Matolcsy said the economy could grow by 2.5-3.0 percent next
year if there is growth of around 0.5 percent this year.
 Structural reforms in the tax system, local governments,
education and state administration would cost money at the
beginning, and this should be acknowledged in the deficit
figures, he added.
 ""We see it possible that from the 3.8 percent deficit level
we go towards 3 percent (in 2011) by a few tenth of percentage
points, (the size of cuts) depends on IMF/EU talks and ... the
situation of the euro zone,"" Matolcsy said.
 
 BANK TALKS
 Hungary's government also wants to collect 200 billion
forints ($855.4 million) from the financial sector in taxes this
year in order to keep the deficit in check. Close to 187 billion
would be raised by way of a new tax, which has triggered
objections from banks who said it would hurt lending and
profitability.
 The tax would remain in place next year.
 Matolcsy said the executive board of the banking association
has withdrawn its willingness to negotiate with the government,
but the cabinet would submit this bill on the bank tax to
parliament on Friday.
 Based on this bill, banks would pay 120 billion forints this
year, insurers would put up 36 billion, and the rest of the
financial sector would pay 30 billion.
 Hungary is vulnerable to negative shifts in market sentiment
due to its high public debt, at around 80 percent of GDP, and
also a large stock of foreign currency debt held by households.
 The government has said it would create an asset management
company by the end of 2010 to help protect troubled borrowers
who are no longer able to pay their loans due to sharp gains by
the Swiss franc in which most of the mortgages are denominated.
 ""This will be a market enterprise consisting of state
guarantees and funds from the bank sector and it will also fund
itself from the financial markets,"" Matolcsy said.
 He said this company, which would essentially work as a ""bad
bank"", would help debtors and banks to convert foreign currency
loans into forints, and also property rights into a lease.
 The state fund could be launched with 30 billion forints of
capital from banks and another 30 billion in the form of a state
guarantee based on preliminary calculations, he said.

is a bad bank, but a special kind, as it is not a bank.""

 BEIJING, July 2 (Reuters) - China will continuously adjust
the currency composition of its official foreign exchange
reserves, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on
Friday.
 SAFE said China's $2.45 trillion in reserves, the world's
largest stockpile, was invested in the dollar, the yen and the
euro as well as currencies of unnamed emerging markets.
 The currency regulator said the sheer size of the holdings
meant China had to be careful about how much information it
disclosed lest it trigger waves in global markets, which would
make its investment task more difficult.
 Bankers assume that about two-thirds of SAFE's portfolio is
invested in dollar-denominated assets.
 Seventy percent of China's foreign debt is in dollars, the
agency disclosed earlier [ID:nTOE66104G]
 By referring to the structure of global foreign exchange
reserves, China arrives at a mix of currencies that enables it to
reduce currency risk and meet its external payment needs, SAFE
said in a statement on its website, www.safe.gov.cn.
 ""Of course, the currency structure will not always be the
same. It will instead be optimised dynamically,"" it said.
 SAFE said China was not deliberately building up reserves,
but having a sufficient sum had helped the country to better
weather the global financial crisis.
 SAFE used the statement to issue a reminder that China could
not spend the reserves freely at home, as some commentators have
urged. Converting foreign currencies into yuan would boost money
supply and generate inflationary pressure, it noted.

trade but the 27-nation European Union accounts for about a
fifth of its exports and more than 13 percent of its imports.
 Here are some facts on the trade between India and EU:
 -- According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the
India-EU trade balance in the April-October period of the
2009/10 fiscal year was a deficit of $777.4 million for India.
Full-year figures for 2009/10 will be released later this year.
 -- India exports to the EU amounted to $19.3 billion
between April and October, and imports were $20.1 billion. In
2008/09, exports to the EU were $24.9 billion, and imports
$27.9 billion.
-- The EU accounted for 20.4 percent of exports in the
April-October 2009. By comparison, Asia accounted for 28
percent and North America 11.9 percent.
 - In the same period, the EU's share in Indian imports was
13.4 percent, compared with 26.6 percent for the whole of Asia
and 6.6 percent for North America.
 -- Analysts see the euro zone sovereign debt crisis as
having little impact on India-EU trade as export demand for
goods like engineering, textiles, chemicals and handicrafts is
mostly inelastic, though software exports could be hit in the
short-run. ""Software would be affected but the recovery in
exports could happen by the end of 2010 or early next year,""
said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings.
 -- The rupee has appreciated 15 percent against the euro
so far in 2010. In comparison, the rupee has completely erased
its gains against the dollar in 2010 from a rise of 5.3 percent
at this year's peak of 44.18 per dollar.

744,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2010 05:40AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-India's trade deficit expected to widen," By Anurag Joshi
 MUMBAI, July 2 (Reuters) - India's trade deficit is
forecast to widen in the 2010/11 fiscal year as its rebounding
economy raises demand for manufacturing and oil imports, while
the euro zone debt crisis hits exports, mainly in software.
 A wider deficit would pressure the partially convertible
rupee, which has lost more than 5 percent from its 2010 peak of
44.18 to the U.S. dollar.
India's trade deficit was $117.3 billion in 2009/10, down from
$118.7 billion in 2008/09. But a Reuters survey in April
forecast the gap would widen to $132.70 billion in 2010/11 and
$154.50 billion in 2011/12.
 Below are scenarios on India's trade deficit:
 - EURO ZONE DEBT CRISIS SETTLES, HELPING EXPORTS, POSITIVE
FOR RUPEE, STOCKS:
 Probability: High
 An easing euro zone crisis would support demand for exports
to the European Union and resulting confidence in emerging
market assets could help both Indian stocks and the rupee.
 EU finance ministers have agreed on a financial safety net
of $1 trillion for bloc members to restore confidence.
 ""This is a temporary flight to safety,"" said Sajjid Chinoy,
an economist with JPMorgan in Mumbai, referring to foreign
portfolio outflows in May. ""There is enough liquidity globally
looking to come to emerging markets and India is one of them.""
 Foreigners pulled $2 billion from Indian stock markets in
May as risk aversion heightened on fears of a Greek debt
default. An easing of skittishness in global markets has
encouraged foreign investors to plough back about $2.3 billion
into Indian stocks in June.
 - OIL PRICES RISE, ADD TO IMPORT BILL, WIDEN TRADE DEFICIT,
WEAKEN RUPEE:
 Probability: Moderate
India imports more than two thirds of its oil needs and any
price spike add to its bill and widens the trade deficit.
 ""With current oil prices and our expecation that average
crude oil prices will be closer to $82 per barrel, we expect
the oil import bill to remain at manageable levels in FY11,""
said Anubhuti Sahay, an economist at Standard Chartered in
Mumbai.
 Oil imports in 2009/10 were $85.5 billion, lower than $93.7
billion in 2008/09. Domestic crude refiners are the biggest
importers and dollar demand from them usually peaks at the end
of every month, pressuring the rupee.
 ""However, should the oil prices spike, it will inflate the
oil import bill. Our analysis indicates that every increase of
$1 per barrel in Indian crude basket prices pushes up the
annual import bill by $1.2 billion,"" said Sahay.
 - EURO ZONE CRISIS WORSENS, WIDENS TRADE DEFICIT BY
CRIMPING EXPORTS, WEAKENS RUPEE, STOCKS:
 Probability: Low
 The chances of the euro zone debt crisis deteriorating have
lessened a lot from May, when worries of a Greek debt default
shook world markets.
 The EU accounts for a fifth of India's exports and if the
crisis there is prolonged or takes a turn for the worse, it
could widen the trade deficit by hurting demand from the
27-nation bloc.
 ""Exports look better than last year. But they will receive
some setback because of euro zone. There won't be a huge
contagion, but global demand will weaken for our exports,"" said
Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.
 The EU accounted for just over a fifth of India's exports
in April-October 2009, central bank data shows. By comparison,
Asia accounted for 28 percent and North America for 11.9
percent.
 ""It would be whether the risk aversion theme is back or
not. I am of the view the euro zone is in serious stress and

748,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2010 04:48AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Watch out: yuan may fall as volatility picks up," * Yuan daily moves bigger in new system, imply possible
fall
 * State banks used to curb dollar gains, promote volatility
 * China does not promise yuan appreciation via depegging
 * Yuan likely to rise medium term, but no straight line
 By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, July 2 (Reuters) - Now that China is staying true
to its word and letting the yuan trade a bit more freely,
analysts and investors outside the mainland may not be prepared
for one potential outcome: a yuan drop.
 China is showing a determination to let the yuan be more
volatile against the dollar within its daily 0.5 percent
trading band and go with the market flow, contrary to some
expectations for another steady rise as happened between 2005
and 2008.
 That means there are no guarantees that the yuan will
appreciate against the dollar over time, and Beijing is set to
stick firmly to its position on yuan flexibility no matter how
much it disappoints critics -- most prominently U.S. lawmakers.
 The fundamentals arguing for substantial yuan appreciation
have changed since the financial crisis: China is running
smaller trade surpluses, and economists see the potential for
the shrinking current account surpluses to turn into deficits
in coming years.
 As a result, the basis for steady but slow yuan
appreciation versus the dollar is not as strong as five years
ago -- one reason why Beijing keeps emphasising flexibility in
its pushing forward the reform of its currency system.
 ""China's new yuan policy lays emphasis on a quick response
to changes in economic and market conditions, with no preset
levels for yuan appreciation either in the short term or long
term,"" said Chen Lu, chief economist at Haitong Securities in
Shanghai.
 The People's Bank of China has matched its words with deeds
by allowing greater yuan volatility since the June 19
announcement and subsequent clarification that flexibility
still means that yuan moves must be gradual and controllable.
 The yuan has moved in an average daily range of more than
100 pips since its depegging, far above the 50 pips that
dealers say would allow banks to engage in proprietary trading
intraday.
 This compared with a daily movement of only a few pips
during the two years when the currency was pegged to the
dollar.
 Banks are just starting to do more day-to-day speculation,
adding to liquidity in the local spot market.
 Before the depegging, the limited daily swings meant all
trading was almost a pure reflection of supply and demand, with
the PBOC keeping the market in check.
 Realised volatility in dollar/yuan has jumped as spot has
started swinging more sharply within the daily trading band on
the official CFETS platform.
 WATCH THE STATE-OWNED BANKS
 The PBOC is apparently fostering two-way trade within the
daily trading band for the spot yuan rate, trying to get banks
and companies accustomed to greater volatility and to hedging
currency risks.
 But during the peak of speculation on yuan gains early last
week, the PBOC used state banks to buy dollars in hefty chunks,
effectively limiting the market's ability to short dollar/yuan
-- especially since banks are not allowed to hold short
positions overnight.
 ""Some big Chinese banks bought dollars in such large
amounts that they could not have been acting on demand from
clients or doing their own trading. They apparently did that on
the PBOC's behalf,"" said a European bank dealer.
 ""Instead of being complacent about the latest yuan rise,
investors may need to prepare for rainy days when the PBOC
actually permits the yuan to depreciate against the dollar.""
 Dealers said the state banks scooped up dollars at a wide
variety of levels, suggesting the authorities were not trying
to defend the yuan at a certain level.
 These mechanisms are a step back from direct intervention
by the PBOC in trading, often employed in the post-revaluation
phase of yuan appreciation from 2005 to 2008 and during the de
facto dollar peg of the past two years.
 Dealers also believe the PBOC may have also adopted a new
formula for setting the mid-point, or its reference rate, for
the daily trading band.
 It appears it sets the mid-point using the yuan's close on
the previous day plus overnight moves in the dollar index,
making the mid-point market-oriented rather than an expression
of the central bank's desires as before.
 But traders expect the PBOC to keep the mid-point as a
ready weapon for the PBOC for limiting any yuan moves during
times of market volatility. The PBOC consults with banks but
keeps the market in the dark as to how it sets the rate.
 During the peg, the PBOC tweaked the mid-point by only one
or two pips each day. Any trades happened far from the
reference rate on a given day would have to be covered around
the mid-point in subsequent days, discouraging moves far from
the mid-point.
 Since the depegging, the yuan has risen as much as 0.83
percent as the PBOC tolerated a rise to a post-revaluation high
of 6.7700 against the dollar on Friday.
 While the new regime has still disappointed critics in the
United States, Chinese market players believe that Beijing will
not make any further concessions and that new pressure from
U.S. lawmakers -- some of whom believe the yuan is undervalued
by as much as 40 percent -- would likely backfire.
 The euro zone debt woes have cast doubt on the pace of
China's recovery, the latest reminder how vulnerable the
world's third-largest economy is to a global slowdown.
 China's still low per person income also argues against
sharp yuan appreciation, economists say, arguing that it is
inappropriate to apply Western standards to the currency of a
country whose GDP per person was only 8 percent of that of the
United States last year.
 ""What China can do is to show that it's friendly, it's
cooperative and it's willing to change in line with economic
and market conditions,"" said a senior Chinese bank dealer in
Beijing. ""As China will adjust the yuan's value on a floating
basis, yuan appreciation forecasts will become more or less a
guessing game.""

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - World shares eked out gains for
only the second time in nine sessions on Friday but the rise was
likely to be contingent on key U.S. jobs data due later.
 The dollar was slightly lower against a basket of major
currencies and euro zone sovereign debt firmed a bit.
 The U.S. non-farm payrolls report, due at 1230 GMT, is
always a market mover, but this month's will be particularly
scrutinised as it comes amid signs of a slowdown in U.S. and
global economic recovery.
 Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a fall in June
non-farm payrolls of 110,000 -- the first drop this year. But it
will be primarily because of the disappearance of temporary
federal census-taking jobs.
 Private-sector hiring is forecast to rise to 112,000 , up
from 41,000 in May.
 Riskier assets such as equities have been hit over recent
weeks by weak data suggesting that the global economy is pulling
back. Some bearish analysts even expect a double-dip recession.
 ""The U.S. economy doesn't look so good. Wall Street is
choppy and it's hard to predict trends, but it's starting to
look a bit like a bear market,"" said Koichi Ogawa, chief
portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments in Japan.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIW00000PUS> was up
0.2 percent, about 8 percent lower than it was when a short

 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed up 0.1 percent. It
has shed 5.5 percent on the week.
 
 DOLLAR STEADY
 The dollar steadied after steep losses on Thursday brought
on by economic concerns, fanned by data showing weekly claims
for U.S. jobless benefits rose unexpectedly while growth in the
manufacturing sector slowed in June.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, a gauge of its performance against
six other major currencies, hovered above a two-month low after
it shed 1.6 percent on Thursday.
 The index was slightly lower on the day at 84.59.
 The euro was holding steady around $1.2518  after
surging more than 2 percent on Thursday to $1.2541 in its
biggest one-day advance since mid-March last year.
 Euro zone government bond yields were flat to lower ahead of
the jobs data.
 ""The market feels a bit long, there may be some
consolidation into payrolls but the risk is we'll see a bigger
move if the number is well above consensus rather than if it is
well below,"" a trader said.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Friday
after steep losses the previous day on growing concerns about
the U.S. economy, with key U.S. non-farm payrolls data looming.
 The greenback hit its lowest this year against the yen below
87 yen on Thursday as market players covered short cross yen
positions.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
other major currencies, hovered above a two-month low after it
shed 1.6 percent on Thursday.
 The index was slightly lower on the day at 84.59, having
broken through its 55-day moving average at around 85.
 Economists forecast a loss of 110,000 U.S. jobs in June
compared with an increase of 431,00 jobs in May, partly skewed
by a drop off in temporary workers hired in May to complete the
census.
 Private payrolls are seen up 112,000 from +41,000 in May
with the unemployment rate at 9.8 percent from 9.7 the previous
month..
 Opinion was divided as to the market reaction to
expectations for a weak reading.
 ""The prospective reaction is not clear-cut. Yesterday's
sharp sell-off in the dollar may provide the most up-to-date
clue, but there are less fraught channels to play the
pessimism,"" said Daragh Maher, deputy head of FX strategy at
Credit Agricole CIB. 
 ""AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY are obvious choices as shorts, while
the Swiss franc will also likely reap the benefits.""
 Others say if the data at 1230 GMT show even more U.S. jobs
are lost than forecast, the dollar could re-test 86 yen to the
dollar.
 A decline in U.S. Treasury yields may also keep pressure on
the dollar.
 
 EURO PESSIMISM EASES
 The greenback was up 0.4 percent at 88.00 yen after hitting
a seven-month low of 86.96 yen. Japanese exporter offers were
likely to emerge in the low 88 yen range, a dealer at a Japanese
bank said.
 One-month implied volatility for dollar/yen pulled back to
around 12.75/13.25 from around 14 percent on Thursday as the
dollar fell to 7 month lows against the yen. Option triggers
were seen below 85 yen, traders said.
 The euro surged more than 2 percent to $1.2541 in its
biggest one-day advance since mid-March last year, and on Friday
it was holding around $1.2518.
 Easing concerns about euro zone liquidity problems after a
lower take-up of ECB money and successful bond auctions prompted
players to cover short euro positions
 ""It seems as if investors braced for the worst from the euro
zone risk events are now relieved that the worst didn't come to
pass,"" analysts at UBS said in a note.
 However, they and others expect banking sector problems will
continue to plague the euro zone.
 The euro faces near-term resistance at $1.2570, a 38.2
percent retracement of its decline from $1.3692 in April to
$1.1876 in early June. Resistance could also come in at its
55-day moving average around $1.2550.
 The euro was steady at 1.3272 Swiss francs after hitting a
record low 1.3073 on Thursday.
 The Australian dollar rose versus the greenback and yen
after Australia's government announced a watered-down version of
a proposed mining tax, easing concerns it could hurt business
investment and share prices.

 * WHEN: Tuesday, July 6, 2:30 p.m. (0430 GMT)
 * REUTERS FORECAST: RBA to hold cash rate steady at 4.5 pct
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, July 2 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is
almost certain to keep interest rates on hold for a second
straight month at a meeting next week, citing renewed concerns
about a global slowdown and as it awaits a fresh reading on
domestic price pressures.
 A Reuters poll of 19 economists showed all expected the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to keep rates unchanged at 4.5
percent on Tuesday after raising them six times since October.
 Some traders are even pricing in a tiny chance of a rate
cut, reflecting growing pessimism in recent weeks over the
health of the global recovery.
 The implied probability , derived from money
market and swap rates, is showing a 7 percent chance of a cut.
Over the next 12 months, markets  are factoring
in a scant 4 basis points (bps) of rate hikes.
 Here are possible outcomes of the July 6 policy review.
 RATES ON HOLD, RBA FLAGS RISKS TO GROWTH
 The RBA has signalled rates are on hold until it sees the
second-quarter consumer price index report on July 28. So, a
decision to keep rates steady is pretty much baked in.
 What investors will scrutinise is the accompanying
statement for RBA's take on financial market turmoil and its
view of risks to the global recovery, including any references
to weakness in the United States and a slowdown in growth in
China.
 The RBA has so far played down fears over China, a major
buyer of Australian resources, adding that some moderation in
its rapid growth was, in fact, desirable. But minutes of RBA's
June meeting showed board members had felt conditions in the
debt-laden euro zone had ""deteriorated significantly.""
 Any added emphasis on global troubles would reinforce
expectations that rates will remain on hold for months. The RBA
had earlier said it has sufficient flexibility to respond
should the situation deteriorate quickly.
 Domestically, the labour market is roaring back, while
underlying inflation is just above the top of the target band
at 3.1 percent. Sharply rising terms of trade will also boost
nominal incomes and growth this year and next.
 So, the cross-currents influencing the Australian economy
and global markets argue for some soberity in policy language.
 Probability: Most likely
 Market impact: The Australian dollar  could come
under pressure as many would interpret this as a signal that
rates will be on hold until the end of the year. Bill and bond
futures, especially at the front end, could move higher.
 HOLDS RATES STEADY, BUT DOWNPLAYS GLOBAL RISKS
 While worries about the resiliency of the global recovery
have intensified, the RBA may choose to downplay that and
prefer to remind investors that the local economy is in good
shape.
 Gross domestic product (GDP) is on track to achieve a
trend-like growth rate of 3 to 3.5 percent in future, and
Australia's trade account has moved back into a surplus
position due to huge rises in iron ore and coal prices.
 Terms of trade -- what the country earns from exports
compared to what it pays for imports -- are expected to rise
around 20 percent this year as Australia's major trading
partners in Asia show a voracious appetite for its commodity
exports.
 Probability: Less likely
 Market impact: The Australian dollar could gain as
investors will turn their attention to the CPI report in July.
A higher inflation reading could seal the case for a rate hike
in August. Bill and bond futures may witness a sell off.
 CASH RATE CUT BY 25 BASIS POINTS
 The few traders who are factoring in rate cut believe that
financial turmoil in the past two months has made it clear that
the RBA perhaps underestimated the contagion effect from the
European debt crisis.
 There are also signs that domestic economic activity is
moderating. The housing sector is cooling while retail sales
have been subdued. Consumer confidence has fallen for three
straight months.
 But it is hard to imagine such a hawkish central bank
cutting without a clear global emergency.
 * Probability: Highly unlikely
 * Market impact: Big. Australian dollar would fall sharply
while bill and bond futures would surge.

 * Aussie up 1 pct on yen after mining tax watered down
 * Euro holds gains after bear squeeze, before U.S. jobs data
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, July 2 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the back foot
against the euro and slipped against the Aussie on Friday after a
big euro short squeeze ahead of U.S. jobs data, while the yen
lost ground all round as the squeeze spilled into Asian trade.
 The Australian dollar rose half a U.S. cent and climbed
against the low-yielding Japanese currency after Australia's
government announced a watered-down version of a proposed mining
tax, easing concerns it could hurt business investment and share
prices.
 The dollar has fast lost favour this week, undermined by
concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy, and it plunged
on Thursday, hitting its lowest this year against the yen, as
short-covering by euro bears unleashed a chain reaction.
 The dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six
other major currencies, hovered just above a two-month low after
it shed 1.6 percent on Thursday, while the greenback staggered up
against the yen after hitting a seven-month low of 86.96 yen in
the fray.
 But it faced selling at 88 yen, with the market on alert for
any comments from Japanese authorities which might signal concern
about yen strength.
 ""This is broad-based dollar sales. It's not risk aversion --
rather dollar aversion,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX
strategist Japan at Barclays in Tokyo.
 The U.S. Labor department releases its June employment report
at 1230 GMT. Economists are forecasting a loss of 110,000 jobs in
June compared with an increase of 431,00 jobs in May..
 A negative surprise could weigh further on the dollar, after
soft economic numbers in recent sessions sent investors worried
about a double-dip recession into safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds
and pushed yields down.
 Dealers said Japanese importer buying of the dollar ahead of
the three-day weekend in the U.S. helped lift it 0.5 percent to
88.04 yen, but its drop through 87.95 on Thursday, when options
triggers sent it down, meant it had broken below the 95-88 yen
range held so far this year.
 One dealer said more options triggers lay below 85 yen. The
dollar fell to a 14-year low of 84.82 last November.
 The euro made its big move against the dollar on Thursday,
surging more than 2 percent to $1.2541 in its biggest one-day
advance since mid-March last year, and on Friday it was holding
steady above $1.2500 at its highest levels in five weeks.
 Charts indicate it faces near-term resistance at $1.2570, a
38.2 percent retracement of its decline from $1.3692 in April to
$1.1876 in early June. Resistance could also come in at its
55-day moving average around $1.2550.
 It was steady at 1.3281 Swiss francs after hitting a record
low 1.3073 on Thursday, and its gains on Friday came instead
against the yen, where it rose 0.4 percent to 110.16 yen.
 The yen also lost sharply to the Australian and New Zealand
dollars, with the Aussie up 0.7 percent at 74.71 yen and the kiwi
gaining 1 percent to 61.10 yen as short-term speculators covered
short positions.
 By later in the Asian session the Aussie had given up early
gains against the dollar made after the mining tax news, with
traders saying activity had fallen away as the jobs data neared.
 It was steady at $0.8477 after rising as far as $0.8510.
 Tony Morriss, a senior FX strategist at ANZ, said the mining
tax news was positive for the Aussie particularly in the short
run as it removed some uncertainty weighing on the currency.
 ""But we have to see how it holds up, given the U.S. payrolls
coming up and a long weekend in the U.S.,"" Morriss said.

 A better-than-expected jobs report could spark a bout of
short-covering and provide a bounce for stocks ahead of the
long U.S. weekend.
 ""Just because the economy is slowing doesn't mean it's
going into a recession, that's the nuance the market has not
figured out. The market has pretty much fully priced in a
double-dip recession; at this point we don't agree,"" said John
Canally, an economist at LPL Financial in Boston.
 Oil was flat steadied after falling more than 3 percent to
below $73, its biggest one-day slide in nearly four weeks, as
weak manufacturing data from China and the United states have
fueled concerns about economic growth.
 Underscoring concerns over the global economy, China's
manufacturing output in June grew at the slowest pace in months
on government actions to cool the property market and curb bank
lending.
 Policy tightening in China and a liquidity crunch due to a
large public share offering has pushed the country's benchmark
Shanghai Composite index down more than 27 percent so far this
year, the worst performing major stock market after Athens.

 * Aussie up after govt waters down mining tax
 * U.S. jobs data eyed, volumes thin ahead of long weekend
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, July 2 (Reuters) - The euro held near five-week highs
against the U.S. dollar on Friday after rallying three whole
cents as speculators were squeezed out of short positions ahead
of a key U.S. jobs report.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was at $1.2514, having jumped
over 2 percent in the previous session, when it rose to as high
as $1.2541 on electronic trading platform EBS. It was the biggest
one-day advance since mid-March 2009.
 The Australian dollar  also jumped half a U.S. cent
to as high as $0.8481 after the country's government announced a
watered down version of a proposed mining tax, easing concerns it
could hurt business investment and share prices. [ID:SYU010158].
 ""This is a positive for the Aussie especially in the short
run as it provides clarity and removes some of the uncertainty
that was getting priced in,"" said Tony Morriss, senior currency
strategist at ANZ. ""But we have to see how it holds up, given the
U.S. payrolls coming up and a long weekend in the U.S.""
 The U.S. Labor department releases its June employment report
at 1230 GMT. Economists are forecasting a loss of 110,000 jobs in
June compared with an increase of 431,00 jobs in May. [ECONUS].
 A negative surprise could weigh on the U.S. dollar which in
recent sessions has ceded ground on soft economic numbers.
 Charts indicate the euro faces near term resistance at
$1.2569, the 38.2 percent of the euro's decline from $1.3692 on
April 12 to $1.1876 on June 7. Resistance could also come in at
its 55-day moving average at around $1.2547.
 Traders said the euro's rally on Thursday started with
profit-taking on short positions in euro/Swiss  after a
key technical level was hit, before cascading to other crosses.
 Euro/crosses rallied strongly, with the euro/yen 
at 109.72 yen, having advanced more than 2 percent in the
previous session. Euro/swissie  was up at 1.3270 francs,
after jumping 2.5 percent to 1.3401 on Thursday.
 Concerns about euro zone's debt, banking sector and liquidity
problems had led investors to short the euro and growth-linked
currencies and pile on to safe-haven currencies like the Swiss
franc  and the Japanese yen  in recent sessions.
 But some of those concerns eased after Spain successfully
sold 3.5 billion euros of a five-year bond, prompting many to
unwind those short positions. Thinning liquidity ahead of the
long Independence Day weekend in the United States also
exacerbated the moves.
 Against the yen, the dollar was steady at 87.72 yen. It had
slid below 87 yen  after reports showed a surprise rise in
U.S. weekly jobless claims, along with a record fall in pending
home sales and slower-than-forecast manufacturing growth.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to a
five-week high above $1.25 on Thursday, while the dollar fell
broadly after disappointing data heightened worries the U.S.
economic recovery is stalling.
 Concerns about euro zone debt and liquidity problems eased
further on Thursday after Spain successfully sold 3.5 billion
euros of a five-year bond, adding to positive sentiment a day
after European banks borrowed less money than expected from a
European Central Bank tender.
 Gains in the single European currency accelerated after the
euro broke key technical resistance levels around $1.2468 and
$1.2470. Thinning liquidity ahead of the long Independence Day
weekend in the United States exacerbated moves.
 ""There's a relief rally in the euro because we have gotten
through the euro zone market events over the past 48 hours,""
said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currency strategist at UBS in
Stamford, Connecticut. ""The euro zone seemed to navigate those
events successfully.""
 In late trading in New York, the euro advanced 2.4 percent
to $1.2521, with the high at $1.2541 on electronic trading
platform EBS. It was the biggest one-day advance since
mid-March 2009.
 Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in
Saddle River, New Jersey, said demand for the euro increased in
late afternoon trading once stops were broken around $1.25,
which prompted traders to rush to cover previous short
positions ahead of a key U.S. monthly employment report on
Friday.
 ""It's a holiday weekend, liquidity is low and people now
are betting tomorrow's jobs numbers will be worse than
expected. It is all helping the euro,"" he said.
 Technical analysts at BNP Paribas said momentum favors a
larger rebound toward $1.2570 to $1.2785 and recommended
investors buy euro/dollar on dips.
 ""For the first time since December, euro/dollar monthly
momentum (eight-month stochastic indicator) has stopped
declining and ticked higher,"" the firm wrote to clients.
 Against the yen, the dollar slid below 87 yen after reports
showed a surprise rise in U.S. weekly jobless claims, along
with a record fall in pending home sales and
slower-than-forecast manufacturing growth.
 ""I think we're shifting away from euro-centric risk
aversion to U.S.-centric risk aversion,"" said Mike Moran,
senior currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New
York.
 The dollar was down 0.9 percent at 87.64 yen after going as
low as 86.96 on EBS, its weakest in seven months.
 CORRELATION BREAKS
 The inverse relationship between the dollar and equities
was showing signs of breaking down on Thursday, as both Wall
Street and the greenback fell.
 For the past several weeks, the dollar has moved in the
opposite direction to stocks, tending to rise when stocks fall
as investors sought it as a safe haven.
 Using daily prices, the 25-day correlation coefficient
between the S&P 500 index and the U.S. dollar index was
negative 0.13 on Thursday, Reuters data showed. The link began
to weaken after last Wednesday's Federal Reserve policy
meeting, at which policy makers offered a less upbeat view on
the U.S. economy.
 In mid-May, the correlation was as strong as negative 0.91.
 Some analysts said the breakdown suggests market players
are perhaps pricing in a greater risk of a double-dip recession
in the United States, which could lead to an erosion in the
dollar's appeal.
 ""Without solid growth and interest rate differentials to
provide fundamental support, further gains in the greenback may
be looking premature,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 The dollar's losses also came in tandem with declines in
gold, which is often used as hedge against high-risk events.
 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was up 0.8 percent at
1.3275 francs after earlier bottoming at 1.3073 on EBS -- its
weakest since the single currency's 1999 launch. The dollar was
down 1.6 percent against the franc, earlier touching its lowest
since mid April.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 1.4 percent at 109.74 yen,
recovering from an 8-1/2-year low hit this week.

 * Big disappointment for a group of U.S. companies
(Adds detail, background)
 WASHINGTON, July 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. trade panel on
Thursday turned down an industry request to slap duties on
hundreds of millions of dollars of a steel product from China.
 The rare ""no"" vote by the U.S. International Trade
Commission bars the Commerce Department from imposing final
duties of up to 437 percent on Chinese-made ""wire decking"" used
in storage rack systems and other applications.
 The ITC voted 4-2 that U.S. producers were ""neither
materially injured nor threatened with material injury"" because
of the imports from China.
 The decision is a big disappointment for U.S. companies
that filed a petition 13 months ago accusing Chinese producers
of selling in the United States at unfairly low prices and
benefiting from government subsidies.
 Those companies were AWP Industries Inc of Kentucky, ITC
Manufacturing Inc of Arizona, J&L Wire Cloth Inc of Minnesota,
Nashville Wire Products Co of Tennessee and Wireway Husky
Corporation of North Carolina.
 Last month the Commerce Department announced final
anti-dumping duties in the case ranging from 14.24 percent to
143 percent and final countervailing duties ranging from 1.52
percent to 437.11 percent.
 The ITC can block duties if it determines U.S. producers
have not been materially injured or threatened with material
injury by the imports.
 The Commerce Department broadly estimated wire decking
imports from China at $235.9 million in 2009, down from $316.9
million in 2008.
 But it noted those figures included some metal furniture
parts not covered by the wire decking case.

 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell to a
seven-month low against the yen and tumbled versus the euro on
Thursday after worse-than-expected data heightened worries the
U.S. economic recovery is stalling.
 The dollar slid below 87 yen, while the euro rallied 2

 Analysts saw the market shifting focus from bad news out of

 Adding to gains in the euro was news European banks

 * Programme launched by President Obama in April

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Marwa Awad
 CAIRO, July 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. trade promotion agency will
invest up to $455 million in five private equity funds in the
Middle East and North Africa as part of President Barack Obama's
push to boost ties with the Muslim world.
 The financing is in response to Obama's speech in Cairo
speech last year, in which he said the United States would set
up a fund to develop technology in Muslim-majority countries,
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) said on
Thursday.
 OPIC said it approved up to $150 million for a fund to be
run by a company owned by Kuwait Projects Co. (KIPCO), Kuwait's
largest investment firm, and up to $150 million for a fund
managed by Dubai-based Abraaj Capital.
 ""OPIC has to operate at no cost to the taxpayer so it has to
be commercially viable,"" said Stephen Everhart, former managing
director at OPIC at an event in Cairo..
 KIPCO, which operates in about 20 countries, said in
November it has about $700 million of debts that mature in 2011.

 OPIC will also invest $100 million in a fund managed by a
subsidiary of Egyptian private equity firm Citadel Capital, it
said. 
 OPIC, a U.S. government agency whose aims include
encouraging economic development in emerging markets and helping
U.S. businesses invest overseas, is one of several partners,
along with USAID, in the Global Entrepreneurship program Obama
launched in April in Washington.
 ""It is not aid it is finance. You hire local managers like
Abraaj and Citadel to run the money,"" said Everhart, who is now
the current associate dean of the school of business at the
American University in Cairo, the local partner for the Global
Entrepreneurship program in Egypt.
 The agency said it will put $30 million into a fund run by
Ramallah-based Siraj Fund Management Company, aimed mostly at
start-ups and small businesses in the Palestinian territories.
 Obama pledged in Cairo on June 4, 2009 to hold a summit on
entrepreneurship to forge ties between American business leaders
and foundations and their counterparts in Muslim-majority
countries to create jobs.

 * Success should stimulate wider economic integration
 * Could lead to single market of 2 billion by 2050
 
 By Ed Cropley, African Investment Correspondent
 JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Reuters) - If it works, the East
African common market launched on Thursday may be the catalyst
to unify the continent's patchwork of small, piecemeal economies
into a mid-century regional giant of 2 billion people.
 Although pan-Africanism has been a rallying cry since the
continent, starting with Ghana 50 years ago, began to throw off
its colonial shackles, political and commercial unity has proved
elusive.
 Roads and railways built by Europeans to carry Africa's
timber and minerals link individual states to the sea, rather
than each other, and the polarising politics of the Cold War
caused conflict, division and mistrust that lingers to this day.
 Slowly, however, Africa is coming together.
 From the 1960s to 1990, exports from sub-Saharan countries
to each other accounted for 5 percent or less of their total
outbound trade, according to the United Nations trade body
UNCTAD.
 By 2006, that proportion had risen to 11 percent, a woeful
performance compared with 46 percent for emerging Asia and 71
percent for developed Europe, but undeniably a step in the right
direction.
 The theory goes that freer and greater trade between African
states will stimulate local economic growth and create jobs by
attracting more domestic and foreign investment and by cutting
reliance on expensive external imports.
 The common market of the East African Community (EAC),
comprising Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi, may turn
out to be the proof needed to make regional integration a
reality rather than a political pipedream.
 ""Intra-African trade is increasingly at the forefront of the
economic reform agenda on Africa, and EAC is a really important
test bed for how well African countries can actually integrate
their markets,"" said Tom Cargill, an Africa researcher at
London's Chatham House think-tank.
 ""So far there's been a lot of talk about this but not a lot
of action on the ground.""
 
 BUILDING BLOCS
 Part of Africa's problem is not so much its lack of regional
trading zones as the presence of too many overlapping and
conflicting agreements that create an institutional dog's dinner
to the detriment of real liberalisation.
 It is home to 14 major economic blocs, more than any other
part of the globe, and of its 53 countries, 27 are members of
two, 18 belong to three and Swaziland has signed up to four.
 Most of them amount to little more than an acronym, but by
taking its five-year-old customs union to the next level and, at
least in theory, removing internal barriers to the movement of
labour and capital, the EAC has created a single trading entity
of 126 million people and an annual output of $75 billion.
 That is a more attractive prospect for a domestic or foreign
firm than five poor countries with populations that will never
provide any economy of scale on their own.
 ""For a big multinational, a market like Rwanda, however
efficient it may be, is too small,"" said Cargill. ""They're
hoping regional integration in Africa can work to provide them
with the advantages of scale to be able to invest meaningfully.""
 If the EAC's experience produces the fruits of overcoming
mutual mistrust and short-term self-interest, it should
stimulate real integration in a continent that will be home to 2
billion people by 2050, more than both China and India.
 ""When there is success in a specific region, it can show
people that it is actually important that people integrate, that
countries integrate, and that they will derive economic and
financial benefit,"" said Janvier Nkurunziza, an Africa trade
specialist at UNCTAD in Geneva.
 
 ANCILLARY BENEFITS
 Suspicion of liberalisation, particularly in socialist
Tanzania, is likely to make it a long, hard road, and the EAC's
goals of monetary union by 2012 and political federation by 2015
are ambitious, to put it mildly.
 As in Europe, selling integration to voters facing more
competition for jobs will also be difficult.
 ""Even before the common market was introduced, we have seen
a mass influx of Kenyans in hotels, banking and insurance
companies in Tanzania,"" said Cathy Charles, a university student
in Dar es Salaam. ""Now the floodgates will be opened.""
 If it works, there will ancillary benefits for both Africa
and the rest of the world.
 Closer commercial links are likely to lead to closer
diplomatic and political ties, making it easier for Africa to
present a united front to the rich and emerging countries
clamouring for its energy and minerals.
 Reducing reliance on exports to developed markets whose
short- and medium-term prospects are modest at best will also
put African economies on a more stable footing.
 The creation of a consumer market in Africa, already home to
1 billion people, has the potential to stimulate growth in
other, more developed corners of the globe -- a view espoused
most recently by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 ""Africa is our future, and will be a principle reservoir for
world economic growth in the decades to come,"" he told a
France-Africa summit in May.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a
seven-month low against the yen on Thursday as economic reports
in both the United States and China added to investors'
uncertainty about the global economic recovery.
 The euro, however, rallied broadly after European banks
borrowed less money than expected from a European Central
Bank's tender, cooling concerns over euro zone banks' funding
issues.
 The dollar slid against the yen after reports on U.S.
manufacturing, claims for jobless benefits and pending home
sales added to concern about both the U.S. and global recovery.

 Chinese manufacturing PMI data showed slower growth in
June, heightening concerns over the global economic recovery
and weighing on high-yielding currencies. [ID:nSGE66004Y]
 ""Weaker than expected Chinese manufacturing data overnight
fanned concerns about the outlook for the world's third largest

Washington.
 ""Unlike the greenback, the yen did benefit from the broad

 Midway through the New York session, the dollar was down
1.1 percent against the yen at 87.44 after going as low as
86.97, according to Reuters data . The low on electronic
trading platform EBS was 86.96, its weakest in seven months
.
 The euro  advanced 2 percent to $1.2475, with the
high at $1.2485, according to Reuters data, extending gains for
a second day and rebounding from a two-week low around $1.2150
hit earlier in the week . It was the biggest one-day
advance since May 19 at current prices.
 The euro zone currency was also supported by Madrid's
ability to sell five-year bonds following Moody's Investors
Service decision on Wednesday to put Spain's sovereign rating
on review for a possible downgrade. [ID:nLDE660051]
 ""A successful Spanish bond auction and lower than expected

 Against the Swiss franc, the euro was last up 1 percent at
1.3318 francs  after earlier bottoming at 1.3073 on
EBS  -- its weakest since the single currency's
1999 launch. The dollar was down 0.9 percent against the franc
, earlier touching its lowest since mid April.
 Thursday's six-day ECB tender led to speculation that
European banks may not be as desperate for funds as had been
earlier thought, helping the euro to hold gains.
 The ECB tender followed an offer of three-month funding the
previous day, which received less bids than expected,
indicating banks were fairly well positioned to repay ECB's 442
billion euros emergency loans on Thursday.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.9 percent at 109.17 yen,
recovering from an 8-1/2-year low hit this week .
 Investors hoping for positive signs of U.S. recovery were
disappointed.
 The U.S. manufacturing sector grew in June for an eleventh
straight month but at a slower rate than expected, according to
an industry report. June marked the second straight month of
slower growth. [ID:nN01107449]

 * Putin says door for Belarus, other countries open
 * Three presidents to meet on July 5
 
 By Darya Korsunskaya
 MOSCOW, July 1 (Reuters) - Russia and Kazakhstan launched
their customs union on Thursday in the first step towards
creating of an ex-Soviet common market for 160 million people,
brushing aside criticism from the West over protectionism. 
 The third ally Belarus, which chose to drop out of the
Union's launch due to the energy trade disputes with Moscow, was
still welcome to join, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
told a government session. 
 ""I believe we need to start work in a trilateral format from
the beginning, with active participation of our Belarussian
partners,"" Putin said. 
 ""The doors for such integration are open ... Integration
with neighbours is the historical choice for Russia.""
 Russia and Kazakhstan will from July 1 use a single customs
code, although a transition period exists for a range of goods,
meaning that the two nations have not completely unified their
tariff legislation.
 Putin took markets by surprise last year when he said that
Russia was dropping its long-standing bid to join the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) in favour of the customs union, saying
the union promised immediate trade benefits for its members. 
 Russia has this year revived the WTO bid but the prospects
of membership either unilaterally or as part of the union look
unclear. 
 
 GAS ROW
 Since the unveiling of the union plans, the relationship
between Russia and Belarus has been marred by trade disputes
culminating in last month's ""gas war"", when Russia cut gas
supplies to Belarus, which in turn halted transit to the EU.
 Some analysts saw the standoff as a way to put pressure on
Minsk, which had refused to join the union until Russia drops
duty on oil supplied to Belarus, where it is processed at local
refineries and re-exported at high profit margin. 
 The Belarus parliament quietly ratified the union's customs
code as soon as the gas spat was over and Russian gas firm
Gazprom agreed to Belarus gas transit terms. 
 ""The creation of the customs union is a complicated process
linked to a labour-consuming and diligent work on hundreds of
positions ... In the European Union similar processes took many
years,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said.
 The presidents of the three countries will meet on July 5 to
decide whether Russia and Kazakhstan should proceed without
Belarus, which borders the European Union, Russia's largest
trade partner, already handling much of Russian trade flows. 
 Russia has used the economic crisis -- which hit it harder
than BRIC emerging market peers Brazil, India and China -- as an
excuse to introduce protectionist measures. 
 Russia was singled out as on of the worst protectionist
offenders in the G20 group of the world's leading economies, and
EU officials have said that the Customs Union is a way to raise
more trade barriers. 
 Putin has said the cabinet is constantly thinking about new
import duties on finished goods to force foreign firms to set up
production in Russia and protect fledgling domestic industries.

 * May get involved with infrastructure, management
 * OSE overhaul key to 110 bln eur IMF/EU bailout
 * Loss-making Greek firm has debt pile of over $12 bln
 
 ATHENS, July 1 (Reuters) - French railway operator SNCF is
in talks to help restructure Greece's state-run train company
OSE, officials said on Thursday, as cash-strapped Athens looks
to cut costs and turn around the loss-making firm.
 ""France, through the SNCF, is very interested in the
modernisation of Greek railways,"" French Transport Minister
Dominique Bussereau said after meeting his Greek counterpart
Dimitris Reppas in Athens.
 French interest concerns both infrastructure projects and
managing Greek trains, Bussereau added without giving further
details, according to a statement provided by Greece's
infrastructure ministry.
Restructuring OSE, which sits on a debt pile of almost 10
billion euros ($12.24 billion), is one of the first conditions
Greece must meet under a 110 billion euro bailout deal agreed
with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
 The socialist government plans to slash loss-making routes
and sell 49 percent of OSE's rail operating unit Trainose.
 Rail workers oppose the downsizing, fearing that about half
of the company's 6,000-strong workforce might be dismissed or
transferred to lower-paid public sector jobs.
 Weighed by rising labour and debt service costs, OSE ran a
deficit of more than 830 million euros in 2008. This accounted
for almost half the 1.7 billion euro loss racked up by Greece's
52 state-run companies that year.
 OSE borrows heavily to pay wages and upgrade its outdated
2,600-kilometre rail network, which mostly consists of a single
track. This makes it unsuitable for large-scale commercial
freight haulage.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - Weak economic data from the
United States and China spurred investors to dump shares and
oil on Thursday as concerns harden that the global economy is
entering a new downturn.
 The U.S. dollar tumbled against the euro and hit a
seven-month nadir against the yen. Gold prices were slightly
weaker, indicating investors are finding few places to wait out
the turmoil that is rife with deflationary forces.
 U.S. and European government bond prices rose, benefiting
from investor caution. Benchmark 10-year U.S. yields fell to
14-month lows.
 In the United States, contracts for pending sales of
previously owned homes plunged a record 30 percent in May, far
more than expected, after a popular tax credit expired.
[ID:nN01108492]
 Additionally, new claims for U.S. jobless benefits rose
unexpectedly in the last week, a day ahead of an the key June
employment report which is expected to show the first decline
this year, according to a Reuters poll. [ID:nN01108492]
 Growth in U.S. manufacturing activity in June slowed to its
lowest level since December 2009, while an official survey
showed the pace of Chinese manufacturing activity last month
was the weakest since February. [ID:nSGE66004Y]
 ""The data plays not only on the economic slowdown story but
also the deflationary/disflationary story. Equities have
extended their earlier losses and the bond market finds
support."" said Marc Chandler, head of currency strategy at
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
 U.S. share prices fell to 10 month lows, with the Standard
& Poor's 500 stock index <.SPX> dropping 16 percent from its
recent April peak.
 In mid-morning New York trade, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> fell 93.41 points, or 0.96 percent, at 9,680.61.
The S&P 500 Index lost 13.04 points, or 1.27 percent, at
1,017.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 32.74
points, or 1.55 percent, at 2,076.50.
 S&P's financial share index <.GSPF> dropped 2.59 percent.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares increased their losses after the weak U.S. economic
data, dropping 2.5 percent to 968.53.
 Investors, however, took heart at the outcome of the
European Central Bank's offering of six-day loans, which saw
banks borrow 111.2 billion euros ($136.1 billion), a figure
that analysts said did not set off alarm bells.
 Investors were worried that European banks are too reliant
on ECB funds, especially with the expiration of 442 billion
euros of one-year loans on Thursday.
 EURO REBOUNDS
 The euro found more buyers after the economic data and
reversed declines to gain on both the U.S. dollar and the yen.
Commodity-based currencies like the Australian dollar fell on
the expectation demand for raw materials will drop as growth
slows.
 The euro surged to a five-week high of $1.2473 before
slipping back to $1.2446  for a gain of 1.73 percent on
the day. The euro gained 0.43 percent to 108.60 yen .
 ""We are still seeing risk aversion in some currencies such
as the dollar and the yen"" after the U.S. economic data, said
Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in New York.
 ""But there is a different reaction in the euro, which is
partly a short squeeze and secondly, the market turning against
the dollar ahead of non-farm payrolls,"" Lien said.
 The Aussie dollar  shed 0.4 percent to $0.8369.
 Oil prices fell for a fourth consecutive day, down 4.5
percent at $72.23 a barrel . Spot gold prices fell
$17.25, or 1.39 percent, to $1224.10 .
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries  rose 13/32 of

770,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2010 11:20AM ET</span>",Turkey seeks to reduce shipping traffic in straits," * Says straits can no longer bear risk of such large tonnage
 * Says new rules could take minimum three years to implement
 * Wants to create a ""voluntary"" consensus for the new rules
 
 By Ayla Jean Yackley
 ISTANBUL, July 1 (Reuters) - Turkey wants to reduce the
number of tankers and the amount of hazardous cargo they carry
through the country's waterways in the next three to four years,
the energy and environment ministers said on Thursday.
 Energy Minister Taner Yildiz and Environment Minister Veysel
Eroglu met executives from oil majors, including BP, Exxon Mobil
, Total, ENI and LUKOIL, in Istanbul to discuss cutting traffic
through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, through which
more than 100 million tonnes of oil and petroleum products pass
each year.
 ""The straits can no longer bear the risk of this tanker
cargo, and we need to limit both the number of ships and the
tonnage they carry,"" Eroglu told a news conference.
 ""Outdated tankers must be replaced with new ships equipped
with advanced technology,"" he said. 
 Last year, 51,722 ships traversed the winding straits, 80
percent of which have obsolete technology, he said.
 Yildiz said the government aimed to cut traffic in the next
three or four years at the earliest.
 Thursday's meeting with international oil companies was the
first, and the government will hold more to create a ""voluntary""
consensus for new rules, he said.
 In the past, Russia in particular has opposed the
introduction of curbs, arguing they create bottlenecks that have
jacked up the cost of shipping.
 
 TREATY
 A 1936 treaty prevents Turkey from outrightly restricting
traffic through the environmentally sensitive channels at either
end of the Sea of Marmara.
 The straits are the only maritime outlet for oil, grain and
other products from Black Sea littoral countries. The
31-kilometre-long Bosphorus bisects Istanbul, a city of some 15
million people and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
 BP's ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, which has
become the worst spill in U.S. history, was a factor in
prompting Turkey to take steps now to address the risk of
potential spills in its own waters, Yildiz said.
 ""It's not the only motivation for this effort, but of course
we were affected by it and it's an important element,"" he told
Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.
 Some 115,000 tonnes of oil have spilled in the Turkish
straits since 1995, Eroglu said.
 Turkey supports the construction of an oil pipelines from
the Black Sea to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, a $2 billion
ENI-led link across Turkey.
 Another 1 billion euro Bulgarian-Greek project -- the
Bourgas-Alexandropoulos -- is also looking to bypass the
straits.
 But a lack of committed suppliers, concerns about costs and
worries about environmental impact have delayed the projects.
 Yildiz said each of the pipeline projects would offer at
least 50 million tonnes of additional annual capacity to
transport crude, thereby sharply scaling back shipping traffic
through Turkish waters.

 By Stephen Jewkes
 MILAN, July 1 (Reuters) - Iren SpA, Italy's third- biggest
regional utility which began trading on Thursday, expects to be
able to pay a dividend of around 70 percent of earnings,
managing director designate Andrea Viero said.
 Iren, created from the merger of northern Italy utilities
Iride and Enia, had 2009 pro forma revenue of 3.16 billion euros
($3.87 billion), behind rivals A2A and Hera.
 Italy's utility sector has undergone considerable
consolidation in recent years as smaller regional players seek
to gain the critical mass to compete with larger national and
European rivals.
 ""We see a payout along the lines of that already announced
(by Iride and Enia) of around 70 percent,"" Viero said on the
sidelines of a presentation.
 Asked if the company could be interested in merging with
Hera, Viero ruled out any such operation in the coming months.
 ""The priority is internal growth,"" he said, adding that if
in the future the right conditions should come along with Hera
or others, ""we intend to study them carefully.""
 
 POSITIVE ON 2010
 Iren, which had pro forma debt of 2 billion euros at the end
of 2009 and core earnings of 567 million euros, will present its
first business plan at the end of this year or in January 2011.
 The group has already said it expects around 70 million
euros of cost synergies over four to five years.
 ""We expect 2010 to be a positive year for Iren,"" Chairman
designate Roberto Bazzano said when asked about results. He said
first-half results for Iride and Enia were good, considering the
economic context.
 Bazzano confirmed the OLT liquefied natural gas (LNG)
regassification terminal off the coast of Tuscany will be
operational before the end of 2011.
 ""We have identified the gas supplies for the terminal but
can't say with who,"" Bazzano said. The terminal, which Iren
controls with Germany's E.ON, will have an annual capacity of
3.75 billion cubic metres (bcm) of which Iren will receive 1
bcm.
 The company also has a stake in the big Gioia Tauro LNG
terminal planned in Calabria which will have a capacity of 12
bcm. The terminal, partly owned by CIR unit Sorgenia, is close
to receiving final authorisation.
 ""No final decision has been taken on that yet,"" Bazzano
said.
 Iren, which has annual gas needs of 4 bcm, currently has gas
contracts in place for around 2.7 bcm.
 A Milan analyst said the Italian gas market could face
possible oversupply problems.
 ""The gas market has changed a lot in the last two years. We
now have to face overcapacity and the possible impact on gas
demand of the reintroduction of nuclear power,"" he said.
 Bazzano said that if Italy went ahead with its nuclear power
plans Iren might be interested in taking a stake in some nuclear
projects.
 At 1415 GMT Iren shares were down 0.24 percent at 1.227
euros while the STOXX Europe 600 Utilities index was down 1.23
percent.

 * Tricky debate over whether subsidies must be repaid

(Recasts, adds details and background, fresh quotes)
 By Tim Hepher
 PARIS, July 1 (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing clashed over aid
for the next generation of European passenger jets on Thursday,
while details emerged on the battleground for possibly lengthy
appeals following a major trade ruling on aircraft subsidies.
 Both sides claimed victory on their favourite points in a
1,000-page ruling handed down on Wednesday by the World Trade
Organisation, which ordered European countries to withdraw
prohibited subsidies to Airbus for its A380 superjumbo.
 The WTO also criticised weaker subsidies for other models of
Airbus aircraft, but rejected several U.S. negotiating points.
 The United States says the ruling showed European Union
states must refrain from offering more development loans, which
are at the heart of the dispute, for the future mid-sized Airbus
A350.
 Boeing also said Airbus should pay back roughly $4 billion
in past A380 loans or restructure them to make them commercial.
 Airbus rejected both points, saying the panel had neither
said how the subsidies should be remedied nor had it tarred the
European funding system as a whole, only the specifics of use.
 ""Boeing's wishful thinking to the contrary, the A350 is
untouched by the WTO's findings. Together with the four
governments, we are moving forward at full speed,"" Airbus head
of communications Rainer Ohler said.
 Boeing said a legal principle had been set.
 ""Continuing with plans to provide $4-5 billion dollars of
taxpayer's money to Airbus for the A350 on anything other than
market terms would be not only unacceptable but prohibited by
the WTO ruling,"" spokesman Charlie Miller said.
 ""It really is time Airbus stood on its own two feet. It is a
mature company, the biggest producer of commercial aircraft in
the world with a cash pile of almost 9 billion euros. It is
perfectly capable of financing aircraft development using its
own cash and commercial loans.""
 
 POSSIBLE APPEAL 
 Airbus typically receives advances from its four founder
states -- Britain, France, Germany and Spain -- for plane
developments which it says it regularly repays with royalties.
 The United States says the loans contain preferred terms and
are illegally tied to exports. The European Union denies this
and says the system itself has not been branded unfair.
 A lawyer familiar with the European case, who asked not to
be identified, disclosed two areas for possible appeal.
 He said the WTO had relied partly on weak preamble language
in contracts when it concluded that German, Spanish and British
loans for the A380 were ""prohibited"".
 It had also, according to the lawyer, wrongly interpreted
Airbus forecasts about where the A380 might be sold as a binding
commitment to export in return for the public advances.
 ""We think this argument -- the key reason for some of the
launch investment to be seen as a prohibited subsidy -- is
vulnerable on appeal,"" the lawyer told Reuters.
 The comments give the first indication of possible tactics
if, as expected, the EU mounts an appeal within 30 days.
 ""We are quite optimistic that an appeal by the EU has a good
chance to succeed and overcome many of the issues that we don't
understand in the current report,"" Airbus's Ohler said.
 The question of whether past subsidies should be repaid is a
sensitive area going to the heart of whether WTO decisions have
real teeth -- but with no agreed definition, trade lawyers said.
 That is because the world's trading partners cannot decide
whether paying back old subsidies would violate an equally
sacred rule that trading decisions cannot be retroactive. 
 No subsidy is known to have been repaid, lawyers said.
 The issue was hammered out in a dispute between the United
States and Australia over aid for a leather exporter over 10
years ago. Australia was ordered to recover a A$30 million grant
but even though the United States won the case it did not
ultimately press for the money to be paid back, lawyers said.
 ""It is a very complex area. To repay a subsidy would require
careful analysis,"" said a trade lawyer not involved in the case
but who asked not to be named to preserve client relationships.
 Airbus parent EADS declined to saw how much it received for
the A380, but its balance sheet shows 4.8 billion euros of total
government loans and analysts say this is mostly for that plane.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - The dollar touched a
seven-month low against the yen and a three-month trough
against the Swiss franc on Thursday as investors grew cautious
about the global economy after China's manufacturing activity
slowed.
 Chinese manufacturing PMI data slowed in June, heightening
concerns over the global economic recovery and weighing on
high-yielding currencies. For full story, see [ID:nSGE66004Y]
 The euro, however, gained broadly after European banks
borrowed less money than expected from a European Central
Bank's tender, cooling concerns over euro zone banks' funding
issues.
 The single currency was also supported by Madrid's ability
to sell five-year bonds following Moody's Investors Service on
Wednesday put Spain's sovereign rating on review for possible
downgrade.[ID:nLDE660051]
 The dollar fell further against the yen after a report
showed the number of U.S. workers filing new applications for
unemployment insurance rose unexpectedly last week, heightening
fears the labor market recovery was stalling. [ID:nN30242258].
 ""We are still seeing risk aversion in some currencies such

Kathy Lien, director of research at GFT Forex in New York. ""But
there is a different reaction in the euro which is partly a
short squeeze and secondly the market turning against the
dollar ahead of non-farm payrolls.""
 In early New York trade, the dollar was down 0.8 percent
against the yen at 87.67 after going as low as 87.47, according
to Reuters data. The low on electronic trading platform EBS was
87.46, its weakest in seven months.
 The euro  advanced 1.3 percent to $1.2392 according
to Reuters data, extending gains for a second day and
rebounding from a two-week low around $1.2150 hit earlier in
the week.
 Against the Swiss franc the euro was last up 0.1 percent at
1.3194 francs  after hitting 1.3073, its weakest since
its 1999 launch, following the Moody's warning on Spain that
raised worries about the health of some euro zone countries.
 But the six-day ECB tender led to speculation European
banks may not be as desperate for funds as had been thought,
helping the euro to hold gains.
 Thursday's ECB tender followed an offer of three-month
funding the previous day, which received less bids than
expected, indicating banks were fairly well positioned to repay
ECB's 442 billion euros emergency loans on Thursday.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.4 percent at 108.62 yen,
recovering from an 8 1/2-year low of 107.30 yen hit this week.

 * Group says no form of asbestos safe
 By Julie Steenhuysen
 CHICAGO, July 1 (Reuters) - An international group of
researchers is renewing its call for a global ban on the mining
and use of asbestos, a known cause of cancer they say is unsafe
in any form.
 They hope to put pressure on the Canadian government to
ban asbestos exports and stop providing financial support to
Canadian companies that mine and export the mineral, once used
widely to fireproof roofs, insulation and other building
materials.
 Although asbestos has been banned in 52 countries, annual
world production is still more than 2 million metric tonnes,
exposing an estimated 125 million people worldwide to asbestos
at work, the researchers said on Thursday in the journal
Environmental Health Perspectives.
 ""We have recognized for decades that all forms of asbestos
are human carcinogens,"" said Dr. Philip Landrigan of the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine and head of the Collegium Ramazzini,
an independent group of academic experts in occupational and
environmental health that is calling for the ban.
 ""It is just not possible to work safely with asbestos,
especially in developing countries where social controls are
weak,"" Landrigan said in a telephone interview.
 Despite ample studies in people and animals confirming the
cancer-causing effects of asbestos, he said sales of the
naturally occurring mineral remain strong.
 ""It's being produced in a small number of countries,
including Canada and Russia. It's almost all being used in the
third world,"" Landrigan said.
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the International
Agency for Research on Cancer, and the U.S. National Toxicology
Program have declared all forms of asbestos to be proven human
carcinogens.
 In additional to cancer, asbestos exposure causes
asbestosis, a progressive, debilitating lung disease.
 In Canada, companies mine chrysotile asbestos, which the
asbestos industry says can be used safely under controlled
conditions.
 But in developing nations, workers often have inadequate

 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - The dollar hit a seven-month low
against the yen and a three-month trough versus Swiss franc on
Thursday as investors remain wary of global economic recovery
after China's manufacturing activity slowed.
 The euro, however, gained broadly, recovering early losses
after European banks borrowed less money than expected from a
European Central Bank's tender, cooling concerns over euro zone
banks' funding issues.
 The single currency was also supported by Madrid's ability
to sell five-year bonds following Moody's Investors Service on
Wednesday put Spain's sovereign rating on review for possible
downgrade.
 Chinese manufacturing PMI data slowed in June, heightening
concerns over the global economic recovery and weighing on
high-yielding currencies.
 ""The underlying market is still that rather negative
sentiment. The currencies that are in particular picking up as
safe-havens are Swiss franc and the yen,"" Simon Derrick, head of
currency research at Bank of New York Mellon in London.
 By 1200 GMT, the U.S. currency fell about 0.8 percent to
87.62 yen on trading platform EBS, its weakest in seven months,
as traders took a stab at stop-loss orders suspected around the
dollar's weakest of the year. The dollar dropped 0.6 percent
against a basket of major currencies.
 The euro advanced 0.8 percent to $1.2332, according to
Reuters data, extending gains for a second straight day and
rebounding from a two-week low around $1.2150 hit earlier in the
week.
 The euro steadied at 1.3181 Swiss francs, though the single
currency had pulled away from 1.3073 hit earlier in the day, its
weakest since its 1999 launch.
 Against the yen, it was flat at 108.15 yen, recovering from
an 8 1/2-year low of 107.30 yen hit this week.
 The euro earlier hit a lifetime low versus the Swiss franc
after Moody's warning, raising worries about the health of some
euro zone countries as the global economy slows.
 However, the results of the six-day ECB tender, which was
largely in line with expectations, helped the euro to hold
gains, as speculation that banks may not be as desperate for
funds as previously had thought.
 Thursday's tender followed an offer of three-month funding
the previous day, which received less bids than expected,
indicating that euro zone banks were fairly well positioned to
repay ECB's 442 billion euros emergency loans on Thursday.
 The Australian dollar, which is seen as a proxy for
Beijing's economic strength as China sucks up many of its raw
materials, traded at $0.8360 after hitting a session low of
$0.8315.
 The Swedish crown hit the day's low against the euro of
9.6030 per euro after Sweden's central bank raised interest
rates by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent as expected, but said

 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Turkey's 3.5 percent growth
forecast for 2010 is modest and there is likely to be an upward
revision, but the euro zone crisis is a concern, Finance
Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Thursday.
 Turkey's gross domestic product grew by a forecast-beating
11.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2010, data
this week showed. Though this was largely attributed to base
effects from the previous year, analysts say the economy is
recovering well after contracting 4.7 percent last year.
 ""Our official target is very cautious,"" Simsek told Reuters
in an interview on the sidelines of an investment conference.
""Most likely we will have an upward revision in our numbers.""
 The OECD and IMF's projections were both for growth of more
than 6 percent this year, Simsek added.
 He said however that the debt crisis in the euro zone could
harm Turkey. This year has seen the euro plunge to four-year
lows against the dollar while austerity measures across the
continent are expected to cut growth and consumer spending for
years to come.
 ""It worries us, the weakness of the euro is eating into
Turkish exports in nominal dollar terms,"" said Simsek. ""Even the
most recent data suggests Europe is Turkey's most significant
trading partner.""
 About 40-50 percent of Turkish exports go to the euro zone,
which is also the source of 60 percent of tourists to Turkey and
about 60 percent of foreign direct investments, he noted.
 However core euro zone countries such as Germany are far
more important for Turkey's economy as the group's smaller
""peripheral"" economies take in just 5 percent of Turkish
exports.
 ""As long as the core countries hold up we should be fine.""
 Turkey's current account deficit could be a concern however
as the gap tends to widen at times of robust growth due to the
country's reliance on imported energy and raw materials.
 Simsek said last year $7.7 billion of foreign direct
investment had been received and he was hopeful the same volume
would come in this year to help plug the gap.
 ""I think the deficit should be manageable, probably around
3.5-4.5 percent,"" he said.
 Turkey is rated Ba2 by Moody's, BB+ by Fitch and BB by
Standard & Poor's, which is sub-investment grade.
 Many analysts say however that Turkey should have an
investment grade rating especially as the economy and banking
system have displayed considerable resilience to Europe's
financial crisis
 ""I agree with the analysts, the market is pricing in and has
traditionally priced in significantly higher ratings,"" Simsek
said, noting Turkey had not had to put in a single penny to
support its banking sector during the crisis.
""When it comes to Turkey, ratings agencies have been behind
the curve.""

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Thursday, recovering early losses as the results of a tender for
short-term European Central Bank funds suggested euro zone banks
were managing to repay emergency loans.
 The euro earlier hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc
after Moody's put Spain's sovereign rating on review the
previous day, raising worries about the health of some euro zone
countries as the global economy slows.
 But a takeup of six-day ECB funds which was largely in line
with expectations helped the euro to hold gains made in European
trade, when speculation that banks may not be as desperate for
funds as previously thought triggered a short squeeze.
 Thursday's tender followed an offer of three-month funding
the previous day, which received less bids than expected,
indicating that euro zone banks were fairly well positioned to
repay nearly half a trillion euros in expiring emergency loans.
 ""(Today's tender) implies less desperation of euro zone
banks to get spare cash,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist
at Societe Generale.
 ""This is a reasonably good thing for the euro.""
 Still, Juckes and other analysts said signs of a weaker
global economy would continue to sting the euro in the second
half of 2010 as it may make it difficult for euro zone countries
to tackle fiscal problems and deal with weak banking sectors.
 By 1025 GMT, the euro traded 0.8 percent higher on the day
at a session high of $1.2338 according to Reuters data,
extending gains for a second straight day and pulling further
away from a two-week low around $1.2150 hit earlier in the week.
 The single currency recovered from an early slide to
$1.2194, which came in the wake of Moody's announcement on
Wednesday that it may cut Madrid's ratings due to sliding growth
expectations and rising fiscal challenges.
 Weaker-than-expected Chinese economic data had also
heightened concerns about a global economic slowdown and
prompted initial selling in currencies perceived to be
higher-risk.
 But many of those currencies, including the Australian
dollar, clawed back from losses after European stocks pared
early losses.

 WEAK CHINA DATA
 The euro was supported after the tender results, and as
Madrid managed to sell five-year bonds after the Moody's
warning.
 The euro was 0.2 percent lower at 1.3159 Swiss francs, but
the single currency had pulled away from 1.3073 hit in earlier
trade, its weakest since its 1999 launch.
 Against the yen, it rose 0.3 percent to 108.50 yen, edging
away from an 8 1/2-year low of 107.30 yen hit this week.
 Despite the euro's gains, analysts remained pessimistic
about the euro's prospects, as signs of a snag in the global
recovery also showed in weaker-than-expected manufacturing data
from China.
 This had pushed the commodity-linked Australian dollar to
the day's low of $0.8315 on concerns that slower Chinese growth
may cut demand for Australian natural resources. It later
recovered to $0.8402, unchanged on the day.
 The dollar was little changed versus the yen at 88.32 yen,
while it slipped 0.3 percent versus a currency basket.
 Despite concerns that the global economy will struggle, the
dollar was unable to benefit from safe-haven demand as investors
were also worried about the health of the U.S. economy.
 Analysts speculate global financial strains may derail the
U.S. economy recovery, and comments by Federal Reserve officials
on Wednesday suggested this could may the central bank will be
in no rush to raise ultra-low interest rates.
 The Swedish crown hit the day's low against the euro of
9.6030 per euro after Sweden's central bank raised interest
rates by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent as expected, but said
the pace of more monetary tightening would likely slow.

 * Fuel price inflation at 12.90 pct vs 13.18 pct
 * June headline inflation seen at 11 pct after fuel hike
 * Crucial monsoon rains running well below normal
 * More aggressive interest rate hike seen at July meeting
 By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Matthias Williams
 NEW DELHI, July 1 (Reuters) - India's food and fuel
inflation eased in mid-June but price pressures will accelerate
again in coming weeks after the government cut fuel subsidies,
adding pressure on the central bank to roll out more aggressive
interest rate hikes.
 A top government official said the drop in food inflation
reported on Thursday was mainly due to the base effect in
comparisons with last year, saying that higher fuel prices
could take the headline inflation reading in June to 11
percent.
 ""There is no reason for celebration,"" the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said when asked about the dip
in food price inflation.
 India's decision on Friday to raise fuel prices has stoked
expectations that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will raise
rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its next policy review on
July 27, twice as much as earlier expected. [ID:nSGE65R007]
 A temporary squeeze on liquidity in the banking system is
widely seen as staving off any rate increase before then.
 The fuel price rises are expected to push up monthly price
inflation by 0.9 percentage points, government officials have
said, exacerbating heading inflation that stood at a
surprisingly high 10.16 percent in May.
 High food prices have presented a political challenge to
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and triggered public protests.
The government hopes a strong harvest will curb price pressures
later in the year, but rainfall since the start of the vital
monsoon season has been 13 percent below normal.
[ID:nSGE65S0FP]
 ""There is little sign that monthly inflation measures will
fall quickly enough to persuade the RBI that further policy
tightening is not required,"" Royal Bank of Canada said in a
note.
 The one-year overnight indexed swap rate has risen 18 basis
points to 5.50 percent  since the release of the
stronger-than-expected May inflation data on June 14.
 The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond 
edged up one bps to 7.54 percent after the official's downbeat
comments on Thursday.
 Earlier, data showed the food price index rose 12.92
percent in the year to June 19, lower than the previous week's
annual rise of 16.90 percent. The fuel price index climbed
12.90 percent compared with last week's annual rise of 13.18
percent.
 Some investors, however, remain convinced that the RBI will
raise policy rates only in small increments, pointing to
growing uncertainties about the state of the global economic
recovery.
 Other reports on Thursday showed growth in Asia and
European manufacturing output cooled in June, offering further
evidence that the recovery is moderating, with a possible
easing of price pressures as a result.
 India's manufacturing growth slowed a notch in June from
its highest in more than two years in May, though it continued
to show expansion for a 15th straight month, according to the
HSBC Market Purchasing Manager's Index. [IDn:BMA007940]
 The survey also showed that input prices for factories were
rapidly easing, though analysts said it was too early to tell
if the trend would continue and take some pressure off the RBI.

 POLICY TIGHTENING CAMPAIGN
 The central bank raised rates by 25 basis points each in
March and in April in a bid to curb mounting price pressures as
economic growth quickened.
 ""Food prices coming down is purely a function of monsoons:
a good monsoon will bring food prices down and the correction
will be sharper in the second half of the year,"" said D.K.
Joshi, principal economist at Crisil in Mumbai.
 ""But now fuel prices will go up and there will be some
impact on perishable (food) prices because freight costs have
gone up.""
 The RBI has forecast headline inflation will ease to 5.5
percent by March 2011, but Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last
month it would revisit that forecast at its July review.
 India's economy expanded by 7.4 percent in 2009/10 and is
expected to grow 8.5 percent in the current fiscal year that
began on July 1, with a further acceleration to 9 percent seen
in 2011/12, according to government forecasts.
 Separately, India's May exports rose for the seventh
straight month, growing an annual 35 percent to $16.1 billion,
official data showed on Thursday. Imports  rose 38.5
percent to $27.4 billion in the same period.
 Asia's third-largest economy is targeting close to 15
percent export growth in the current fiscal year, though
worries about the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis
are clouding the outlook for global demand. [ID:nSGE64602Q]

Union on Thursday for launching a probe into a complaint that
China is dumping wireless modems in EU markets.
 ""The case involves a huge amount of money. The Chinese
public and industry are strongly dissatisfied, and the Chinese
side are very concerned,"" the Ministry of Commerce said in a
statement on its website, www.mofcom.gov.cn.
 The products under investigation are known as wireless wide

provide Internet Protocol (IP) data connectivity for computers.
 The European Commission, in charge of trade policy for the
27-nation bloc, said on Wednesday that it had received the
complaint from Belgium's Option, the sole maker of the wireless
Internet devices in Europe.
 The EU is China's largest trading partner, and MofCom said
China always advocates the resolution of trade disputes through
dialogue and cooperation rather than protectionism.
 China will pay close attention to developments and reserves
the right to take further steps in accordance with World Trade
Organisation rules, the ministry said.
 The EU has up to 15 months to carry out its investigation.
If the Commission finds that the products are being dumped at
unfair prices, it can impose additional tariffs.

with other countries that are crucial to economic growth,
President Ma Ying-jeou said on Thursday, despite China's
opposition to these agreements.
 Taiwan intends to sign with other Asian countries FTAs that
will help the long-term growth of its export-reliant $390
billion economy, Ma said, even though China, which claims the
island as its own, said it would bar its diplomatic allies from
going into such deals.
 ""On that issue we should have a chance,"" Ma told a news
conference when asked about the free trade deals.
 ""There are actually some Southeast Asian nations and other
Asia-Pacific nations that are interested,"" Ma said, pledging to
pursue them. ""I believe that there should be some specific
results coming out over in the near future.""
 Self-ruled Taiwan's relations with China have improved
after six decades of tension after the signing of their own
two-way trade pact on Tuesday.
 China said last month that it would bar its 170 diplomatic
allies including the world's most powerful nations from signing
government-to-government trade deals with the self-ruled island
that Beijing claims as its own.
 China and Taiwan's economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) heavily favours Taiwan with 539 import tariffs cut by
Beijing, twice what it gets in return, as the world economic
powerhouse dangles sweeteners that it hopes will lead the
self-ruled island to political unification.
 Taiwan had hoped that ECFA would open doors to trade deals
with other major economies such as Japan, the United States and
Southeast Asian nations, allowing its economy to stay
competitive with regional rivals.
 Beijing may ultimately find a way to let Taiwan, also a
free-standing World Trade Organisation member, sign FTAs as a
further show of goodwill, analysts say.
 Taiwan today has only five FTAs with Central American
countries, which are among its own 23 diplomatic partners.

 * Wants UK to strengthen ties with emerging economic powers
(Adds more quotes from radio interview)
 By Adrian Croft
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Britain's new government will
seek to increase the country's influence in the European Union
and strengthen ties with emerging economic giants Brazil, India
and China, Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Thursday.
 Hague said relations with the EU were crucial and had been
neglected under the previous 13 years of Labour rule.
 The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition formed after
Britain's May 6 election has worked constructively with its
European partners, surprising those who had expected a strongly
Eurosceptic stance, he said.
 Speaking on BBC radio before giving a major speech on
foreign policy, Hague also said putting the Britain's finances
back into shape was essential to foreign policy success.
 ""...the real economic action in the world has been taking
place in Brazil and India and China and the Gulf states and
those are the places to which we have to connect ourselves much
more strongly than we have ever tried to do before,"" he said.
 The government is proposing deep spending cuts to rein in
Britain's record peacetime budget deficit.
 In advance excerpts from the speech, he said diplomacy could
play a key role in supporting Britain's economy, which is slowly
recovering from deep recession.
 
 PLEDGES DROPPED
 Hague is a former leader of the centre-right Conservatives,
who promised before the May election to try to wrest back some
powers from Brussels. But the Conservatives failed to win the
election outright and were forced to form a coalition with the
centre-left, pro-European Lib Dems.
 Some of the tougher Conservative policies on Europe -- such
as the pledge to claw back powers -- were jettisoned although
the coalition is still committed to holding a referendum before
any new powers might pass to Brussels.
 ""It is mystifying to us that the previous government failed
to give due weight to the exercise of British influence in the
EU,"" Hague said in the speech.
 ""They neglected to ensure that sufficient numbers of bright
British officials entered EU institutions, and so we now face a
generation gap developing in the British presence in parts of
the EU,"" he said.
 The number of British officials at director level in the
EU's executive Commission had fallen by a third since 2007 and
Britain was sharply under-represented at junior official level,
he said. ""We are determined to put this right,"" he said.
 The Conservatives may also want to promote British
influence in Europe to lend support to their view that the EU
should be an association of states rather than a federation.
 Labour's years in office were overshadowed by wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan. Britain sent troops to both countries and still
has 9,500 troops battling Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.
 Hague also said Britain had an ""unbreakable alliance"" with
the United States.

(Adds details, background)
 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - New Bank of Japan board member
Yoshihisa Morimoto said on Thursday that it is vital for the
central bank to show its resolve to beat deflation, but he
stopped short of elaborating on his views on monetary policy.
 ""I think deflation is a major challenge facing the country's
economy ... It is important for the BOJ to respond to deflation
by showing a clear resolve to end it through comprehensive
measures,"" Morimoto said at his first news conference as a board
member.
 He said the public's subdued growth expectations are to blame
for the wide gap between supply and demand, the main cause of
deflation, and that policymakers need to make persistent efforts
to boost demand.
 Morimoto, a former executive at Tokyo Electric Power Co,
Asia's biggest utility, started work on Thursday, filling the
final vacancy on the nine-member board.
 He offered few clues about his stance on monetary policy and
toed the BOJ's official line that the bank needs to support
companies and households through ample fund supplies.
 Analysts say Morimoto's contribution to policy debate will
likely be limited given his lack of experience in monetary
policy, while some say his nomination may be intended to increase
the influence of Japan's biggest business lobby, Nippon
Keidanren.
 The BOJ has kept interest rates at 0.1 percent since late
2008, and eased monetary policy last December and again in March
by setting up and later expanding a facility offering cheap funds
to banks.
 The bank, after last month's board meeting, detailed its new
loan scheme aimed at beating deflation over the longer term,
saying it would provide up to 3 trillion yen ($34 billion) to
industries with growth potential.
 The BOJ will hold its next board meeting on July 14-15 and
will likely keep interest rates near zero and review its
long-term growth outlook issued in April, which is for the
economy to recover on strong Asian growth.
 Morimoto also warned that the yen's rise would affect
corporate sentiment and profits, and said he would closely watch
the impact of the currency's strength.

 DUBAI, July 1 (Reuters) - The cloud over the financial
future of Dubai after the Dubai World debt crisis is the
overriding risk to watch in the United Arab Emirates this year.
 Added to that are some lingering worries about an escalation
of Iran's nuclear dispute with Western powers, a long-running
territorial row with Iran and Islamist extremism.
 
 DUBAI DEBT AND FINANCIAL WOES
 The United Arab Emirates' economy is expected to grow by 2.5
percent this year, the slowest pace in the Gulf Arab region, as
large debts burdening state-linked firms in Dubai weigh on a
recovery following the Dubai World debt crisis. 
 Dubai's finances had already been a subject of concern after
the global financial crisis popped a property bubble that saw
multi-billion-dollar projects shelved and thousands of job cuts.
The UAE economy is estimated to have shrunk 1.4 percent in 2009.
 But the real shock came when Dubai World, one of three
flagship holding companies of the Dubai government, said in
November it would seek a delay on repaying $26 billion of debt
linked mainly to property units Nakheel [NAKHD.UL] and
Limitless, sending global markets into a tailspin.
 Neighbouring Abu Dhabi, the seat of the seven-member UAE
federation and home to most of its oil wealth, lent Dubai $10
billion, helping avert default on a bond issued by Nakheel.
 Dubai World reached a deal in May to restructure $23.5
billion in debt with its core lenders, addressing the most
immediate of a string of problems facing investors in Dubai.
 The deal must still be agreed by banks outside the core
negotiating panel, which holds 60 percent of the exposure.
Failure at that could damage the UAE's ability to tap credit
markets for years to come, hindering growth.
 Debt troubles at Dubai Inc, as the network of state-linked
firms are known, remain a worry for investors. Private equity
firm Dubai International Capital, a unit of Dubai Holding, in
May requested a three-month delay on repaying some obligations.
 Meanwhile, Dubai Holding, owned by the Dubai ruler, faces
challenges to meet some $14.8 billion in obligations.
 Analysts say Dubai's debt crisis has strained relations
between Dubai, known for extravagant real estate projects, and
the wealthier but more staid Abu Dhabi.
 The two emirates have shared the financial and political
reins of the UAE since its inception in 1971, but further
assistance from Abu Dhabi could boost its role at the helm of
the federal union, possibly upsetting a delicate power balance.
 What to watch:
 - The final outcome of the Dubai World deal with creditors.
 - Will Abu Dhabi have to intervene further to meet any Dubai
debt obligations? Abu Dhabi would prefer Dubai stand on its own
and wants to contain further spillover effect from Dubai's debt
onto its economy and that of the federation.
 
 BUSINESS SENTIMENT
 Lack of transparency and worries about government guarantees
for the debt of massive state-linked companies will make
investors wary about keeping their money in the country after
Dubai's debt debacle. 
 Dubai needs to take concrete steps to improve transparency
and communication after initially leaving investors in the dark
about the fate of their money and making overly optimistic --
and confusing -- statements at the height of the crisis.
 Whereas other Gulf states funded growth with proceeds from
soaring oil prices, Dubai borrowed to invest through a network
of state-linked conglomerates that offered limited transparency.
 Creditors lent to state-linked Dubai companies on the
implicit understanding that they would be backed by the Dubai
government only to find there were no such formal guarantees.
 Dubai World's troubles have raised fears among investors
that other state-linked firms could also face problems. Moody's
downgraded seven Abu Dhabi state-linked firms in March, citing a
lack of explicit state support in the wake of Dubai's crisis.
 What to watch:
 - The possibility of debt problems emerging in other
state-linked units, which could hamper investment.
 
 REGIONAL ISLAMIST MILITANCY 
 The United Arab Emirates, the world's third largest oil
exporter, has so far been spared major al Qaeda attacks that
have hit other Gulf states but as a regional business and
tourism hub it could make an attractive target for militants.
 Al Qaeda sparked fears of a regional resurgence after the
merger last year of the group's Yemeni and Saudi branches into a
Yemen-based regional arm, which went on to claim responsibility
for a failed plot to bomb a U.S.-bound plane in December.
 The group has threatened attacks on Westerners in the Gulf
region and seeks the fall of the U.S.-allied Saudi royal family.
 While the UAE may not be al Qaeda's top target in the
region, it has many potential targets, with a large expatriate
population and Western institutions such as retail outlets,
restaurants, banks and schools, as well as bars and nightclubs.
 The UAE does have tight security that may have helped it
ward off attacks until now, but as an old regional trade centre
it has had an open door to people from many walks of life. This
has also made it vulnerable to international score-settling.
 Earlier this year a Hamas leader was killed in a Dubai hotel
room, in a hit widely blamed on Israel. 
 What to watch:
 - Any expansion of attacks by the Yemen-based al Qaeda arm
in the region could mean that all Gulf countries, including the
UAE, are at risk of being targeted. A serious attack could
unsettle local and international markets, particularly energy.
 - Could the UAE become the scene of more potentially
destabilising political assassinations by foreign elements? More
score-settling could prompt the UAE to tighten entry rules on
what has been an open business and tourism hub."

 * Global equities, commodities under pressure
 * ECB lends 111 bln euros in 6-day funds to banks
 
 By Ian Chua
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - World stocks fell to three-week
lows on Thursday and commodity prices sagged after data showing
China's rapid growth was losing steam added to worries about the
strength of the global economic recovery.
 Wall Street looked set to track Asian and European peers
lower with U.S. stock index futures all in the red.
 Investors, however, took heart at the outcome of the
European Central Bank's offering of six-day loans, which saw
banks borrow 111.2 billion euros ($136.1 billion), a figure that
analysts said did not set off alarm bells.
 Investors were worried that European banks are too reliant
on ECB funds, especially with the expiry of 442 billion euros of
one-year loans on Thursday.
 ""There's a bit of relief in the market that some of the
worries about funding concerns in Europe may be overdone,"" said
Nick Stamenkovic, strategist at RIA Capital Markets.
 Also helping to lighten the mood was Spain's successful sale
of 3.5 billion euros of bonds despite Moody's warning late on
Wednesday that it may cut the country's Aaa credit ratings.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index shed 0.4 percent,
having earlier fallen as much as 0.9 percent to fresh three-week
lows. In the first half of 2010, it dropped some 10 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares and the
euro zone's blue-chip index, Euro STOXX 50 were both down about
0.9 percent.
 Bank stocks pared losses after the ECB tender result with
the STOXX Europe 600 banking index down 1.1 percent, having
earlier fallen more than 2 percent.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average slid 2 percent to a
seven-month closing low.
 ""Asian growth has been the engine of the world economy so it
doesn't bode well if China is losing steam,"" said Jacques Henry,
analyst at Louis Capital Markets, in Paris.
 ""The market had doubts about the global economy, and these
numbers are confirming the doubts.""
 An official survey showed the pace of Chinese manufacturing
activity slowed in June to the lowest since February, while
HSBC's separate purchasing managers' index dropped to a 14-month
low, with outright drops in output and new orders.
 While China's growth had been expected to cool from a
double-digit pace in the first quarter, the latest reports
combined with Europe's debt crisis and persistent weakness in
the U.S. housing and labour markets to spread a negative view on
the global recovery.
 
 EURO REBOUNDS
 The euro reversed earlier declines, but commodity-based
currencies like the Australian dollar fell on growth worries.
 The single currency rose 0.7 percent on the day against the
greenback to $1.2314 and was a touch firmer against the yen at
108.16.
 ""(Today's ECB tender) implies less desperation of euro zone
banks to get spare cash,"" said Kit Juckes, currency strategist
at Societe Generale. ""This is a reasonably good thing for the
euro."" 
 The Aussie dollar shed 0.4 percent to $0.8365.
 Oil prices fell for a fourth consecutive day, down 1.4
percent at $74.56 a barrel, while three-month copper futures on
the London Metal Exchange slid two percent to $6,389.00 a tonne.
 Despite the risk averse backdrop, safe-haven assets such as
U.S. Treasuries struggled to make further gains with the
two-year yield not far off a record low of 0.59 percent set on
Wednesday.
 In the euro zone, the benchmark two-year German government
bond yield climbed sharply to 0.7 percent as short-term rates
adjusted upwards to reflect lower money market liquidity.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers lashed out at
a rising yen on Thursday, warning that the currency's gains due
to worries about the global economic recovery and Europe's
financial woes could threaten Japan's tepid economic revival.
 Bank of Japan board member Yoshihisa Morimoto, in his first
press conference after joining the central bank, said he is
watching the yen closely because it could hurt profits and
sentiment. One of Japan's two deputy finance ministers also said
a weak yen is ""generally beneficial"" to the country's exporters.
 The BOJ's April-June tankan survey showed on Thursday that
big manufacturers turned optimistic for the first time in two
years as a rapid recovery in exports has boosted corporate
profits.
 The outlook is less encouraging because export growth has
started slowing and domestic demand could weaken as companies
still have excess labour, economists say. The yen could be a
worry for Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who is trying to convince
voters before an election next week that his Democratic Party can
spur growth and repair public finances with higher taxes.
 ""A stronger yen and weaker euro will affect firms' global
competitiveness, profits and sentiment,"" Morimoto said.
 Morimoto, a former executive at Tokyo Electric Power Co,
Asia's biggest utility, started work on Thursday, filling the
final vacancy on the BOJ's nine-member board.
 The yen edged higher on Thursday, with the euro dipping 0.1
percent to 108.09 yen. The euro fell as low as 107.50 yen
earlier, nearing an 8-½ year trough of 107.30 yen hit this
week.
 The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 88.38 yen after striking a
two-month low of 88.08 yen on EBS earlier.
 EXPORTERS' PAIN
 The yen's latest rise has brought it to levels that could
cause pain to Japanese exporters if gains are sustained, with the
BOJ's tankan survey showing the average forecast for the
dollar/yen rate in the year to next March among large
manufacturers is 90.18 yen.
 A stronger yen erodes exporters' profits when repatriated and
makes their products more expensive overseas.
 Japan has not intervened in the currency market since March
2004 and is unlikely to resume intervention because it supports
more flexibility in China's yuan, analysts say.
 Japanese officials are more likely to stick to verbal
intervention by trying to talk down the yen, analysts say.
 ""There's no use asking me about foreign exchange rates
because I won't comment,"" deputy finance minister Motohisa Ikeda
said on Thursday, when asked about recent yen gains against other
currencies and their impact on the Japanese economy.
 ""But I'm aware that they say, generally speaking, a weak yen
is good for Japan which has a high weighting of export
industries.""
 Ikeda, speaking to reporters, also said he would not comment
on specific currency levels.
 He emphasised the government's stance of avoiding excessive
yen rises so the country can achieve economic growth backed by
both external and domestic demand, as pledged in its growth
strategy aimed at achieving an average 2 percent growth over the
next decade.
 Japan's ruling Democratic Party faces a July 11 upper house
election that it needs to win to forge ahead with policies
including steps to rein in huge public debt, such as a possible
sales tax rise in two or three years.

(Adds detail, background)
 By Arno Schuetze and Philipp Halstrick
 FRANKFURT, July 1 (Reuters) - No German bank is in acute
danger from a probe into the health of Europe's lenders, banking
and regulatory sources said, and there is enough cash available
to fill any gaps if the situation worsens.
 Europe's banking watchdogs have been holding stress tests to
see how lenders would be affected by a sharp downturn in the
economy or other shocks, aiming to boost confidence and bring a
a negative spiral in financial markets to a halt.
 They are working ahead of an end-of-July deadline to publish
the test results.
 ""I do not believe that any of the 16 German banks tested
could fall under the crucial 6 percent in terms of the Tier 1
ratio,"" a senior banking source said.
 This source did not see the country's eight landesbanks --
regional wholsesale banks owned by local states and savings
banks -- at risk either, given the high level of support they
already have from their current owners.
 The United States and Britain tested banks in 2009 and
Europe's Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) --
which groups the 27-nation bloc's national supervisors -- is now
doing the same for 25 banks. 
 The supervisors will collect data on capitalisation and
non-performing loans, and will then see what the impact on
capital is from a further increase in bad loans.
 They have looked at a list of around 25 larger European
banks in a first round of tests that started in March, the
sources said, and they will now look at a wider group of 100
banks that include German and Spanish regional banks.
 There is fewer data about Germany's landesbanks and Spain's
cajas, and the fear is that many of Europe's biggest problems
lie with these smaller players.
 In the unlikely case that a German bank would fail to pass
the mark in the test, the Bundesbank would ask them to access
capital markets or get funds from rescue fund Soffin, which
still has 300 billion euros ($367.1 billion) in funds.
 Soffin has pumped billions of euros into the country's
second-biggest lender Commerzbank, and took over property lender
Hypo Real Estate.
 The Financial Times on Thursday quoted an unnamed senior
banker as saying the tests may force two to four German banks to
seek help from Soffin.
 
 
 BANKRUPT COUNTRY?
 One unresolved issue was the way in which sovereign debt
exposure should become a part of the test, regulatory and
banking sources said, with regulators seen wary of running
scenarios in which a country went bankrupt.
 ""If the ECB says the probability of a Greek default is X
percent, this will evoke political problems,"" one source said.
 Instead, the regulators could use some form of a proxy by
looking at financial market spreads of sovereign debts, some of
the sources said. The ECB and national central banks advise CEBS
on the stress tests which could instead.
 Some of the 16 German banks in the test were reluctant to
supply the data as long as the assumptions for the tests
remained unclear, or because they didn't want the results out in
the public, according to financial sources.
 ""They are fine about disclosing the key results of the test
but do not want see all the sensitive data published,"" another
financial source said.
 A European Central Bank tender on Thursday eased some of the
fears about euro zone banks that have unnerved financial markets
in recent months, suggesting they can cope with the repayment of
almost half a trillion euros in emergency loans.
 According to banking and regulatory sources the sample of 25
banks did not include just the biggest banks, but also looked at
other aspects of ""systemic relevance"". 
 For example, the relatively small Austrian banks Erste Group
and RZB were in the group of 25 due to their eastern Europe
exposure. 
 Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week that
the first three to be tested in Germany -- Deutsche Bank,
Commerzbank and landesbank BayernLB -- passed the initial tests.

 HONG KONG, July 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks and commodities
fell while U.S. Treasury futures rose to a 14-month high on
Thursday, after manufacturing data showed China's rapid
economic growth was slowing, increasing fears of a global
double dip.
 Major European stock markets were expected to open as much
as 2 percent lower, according to financial bookmakers,
following two reports that showed China's factories were
shifting down a notch.

 * China June PMI below forecast, hurts Aussie
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro hit a lifetime low against
the Swiss franc on Thursday, as weaker-then-expected Chinese data
added to doubts about the strength of the global recovery, while
jitters about funding strains in the euro zone lingered.
 China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to
52.1 in June from 53.9 in May, weaker than the median forecast of
53.1.
 The index was still above the threshold of 50 that demarcates
expansion from contraction but the more modest rate of growth in
the leading indicator stoked worries that a sharper slowdown is
in store in the second half of this year.
 The Chinese data also sparked selling in higher-yielding
currencies, with one trader saying that low liquidity and
short-term speculators taking punts on euro/Swiss and the
Australian dollar against the yen added to the volatility.
 ""The Chinese PMI data was the latest factor making investors
reluctant to take risks,"" said Hideki Amikura, deputy general
manager of forex trading at Nomura Trust and Banking.
 The euro fell as low as 1.3084 Swiss franc on trading
platform EBS, its weakest since the single European currency's
launch in 1999.
 Against the Japanese currency, the euro fell 0.5 percent to
107.61 yen, nearing an 8 1/2-year trough of 107.30 yen hit
earlier this week.
 The dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 88.23 yen after striking a
two-month low of 88.14 yen on EBS.
 The euro slipped 0.3 percent to $1.2205, giving back most of
the previous day's advances.
 It gained on Wednesday after euro zone banks borrowed less
money than expected from the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB
said 171 banks borrowed 131.9 billion euros over three months,
which was below expectations of 210 billion euros.
 The amount is still the highest ever borrowed in a
three-month operation but pales beside the 442 billion euros of
one-year money which banks must repay to the ECB on Thursday.
 Spanish, Portuguese and Greek banks have been the biggest
users of the facilities. Gains in the euro were, however, limited
after Moody's Investors Service said it may cut Spain's Aaa
sovereign debt ratings on deteriorating economic growth
prospects..
 Market focus now turns to the ECB's six-day tender later in
the session. Expectations are that the tender will be subscribed
to the tune of 75-125 billion euros. A lower-than-expected level
of subscription could underpin the euro.
 ""In addition, Spain's five-year bond auction requires
attention especially following the news on the possible downgrade
in the country's rating,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New

 By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - Big Japanese manufacturers turned
optimistic for the first time in two years in the April-June
quarter and forecast a rise in capital spending plans in a sign
that a slow economic recovery is taking hold.
 The Bank of Japan tankan of more than 11,000 companies also
showed optimism among big manufacturers would grow further in the
current quarter, although analysts said the report may not have
accounted fully for a sharp drop in Japanese stocks between April
and June and a rally in the yen to a two-month high against the
dollar.
 The yen is higher than the level big manufacturers, the main
drivers of Japan's exports, have forecast for the current fiscal
year to next March and companies hardly see the need to increase
hiring, the report showed, suggesting headwinds to the recovery
from the global downturn that would require the central bank to
keep monetary policy loose.
 Most other manufacturers and service-sector firms reported an
improvement in sentiment but were still pessimistic.
 ""Overall, the tankan survey shows better corporate sentiment,
especially among big manufacturers, who have raised their
outlook, but it still leaves some elements of concern,"" said
Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Trust and Banking in
Tokyo. ""The survey does not paint an entirely optimistic view for
the economy.""
 The headline index measuring big manufacturers' sentiment
improved 15 points to plus 1 in the three months to June, nudging
above the zero threshold that divides optimism from pessimism. A
Reuters poll had forecast an outcome of minus 4.
 These firms, including industries such as automobiles,
machinery, construction and retail, have been pessimistic since
the third quarter of 2008 when the world economy was hurtling
towards a recession precipitated by the collapse of Lehman
Brothers.
 The big manufacturers' index is seen rising to plus 3 in the
third quarter, which would mark the sixth straight quarter it has
shown an improvement.
 Encouraged by solid exports to Asia, big firms forecast a 4.4
percent rise in capital spending this financial year, following
two years of spending cuts.
 YEN WORRY
 Big firms made up about a fifth of the survey, but attract
most interest because they drive the country's exports.
 The report was largely ignored by financial markets, which
focused more on concerns about a fresh setback for the global
recovery following data pointing to a slowdown in China.
 Yields on Japanese government bonds fell to a seven-year low
and the Nikkei average dropped to a seven-month low. That
followed a 15 percent decline in the second quarter.
 Japan's economy expanded faster than Europe and the United
States in the first quarter, lifted by strong exports. However,
deflation and ample spare production capacity are limiting the
scope for a pickup in growth.
 Indeed, recent trade and industrial output data have pointed
to a moderation in Japan's economic growth through the middle of
the year.
 ""Uncertainty over the outlook, stock falls, the yen's further
gains as well as a rise in real interest rates due to deflation
may hit corporate capital spending ahead,"" said Junko Nishioka,
chief Japan economist at RBS Securities.
 That adds to the challenges for Prime Minister Naoto Kan as
he leads his ruling party into a July 11 upper house election
with pledges he can strengthen the economy and repair the
country's tattered finances with tax hikes.
 The yen was trading at 88.35 per dollar, above the 90.18 that
big manufacturers expect to be the average level this fiscal
year. They raised their forecast from 91.00 yen three month ago.
 Some analysts say a central bank lending programme introduced
in December was partly designed to push the yen lower to help
exporters. The further the yen rises, the more pressure the
government may put on the central bank for more policy action.
 The tankan will be scrutinised at the next central bank rate
review on July 14-15. The central bank will likely keep rates
near zero and review its long-term forecasts for the economy to
recover on strong Asian growth.
 ""The economy is moving in the direction that the BOJ and the
government are describing, but there is still a long way to go
until we get a self-sustained recovery,"" said Naomi Hasegawa, a
senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities in Tokyo.

 TOKYO, July 1 (Reuters) - The mood among Japanese businesses
turned positive for the first time in two years and big firms
revised up capital spending plans, a Bank of Japan survey showed,
in a sign the export-driven economic recovery is taking hold.
 The survey for the three months to June showed Europe's
sovereign debt woes and the sharp appreciation in the yen that
followed have not yet taken a toll as Japanese companies benefit
from solid exports to Asia.
 ""Overall, the tankan survey shows better corporate sentiment,
especially among big manufacturers, who have raised their
outlook, but it still leaves some elements of concern. The survey
does not paint an entirely optimistic view for the economy,"" said
Ayako Sera, a market strategist at Sumitomo Trust & Banking.
 The headline index measuring big manufacturers' sentiment
improved 15 points to plus 1 in June, the BOJ's closely watched
tankan quarterly survey showed on Thursday. That was higher than
a median market forecast of minus 4 and was the fifth consecutive
quarter of improvement.
 The index for September was seen at plus 3, showing firms
expect conditions to improve further over the next three months.
 In a sign the recovery was broadening, the survey showed big
firms expect to increase capital spending by 4.4 percent for the
year that started in April.
 While that was smaller than the 4.9 percent rise forecast by
economists, it was an improvement over the previous tankan that
showed companies planned to cut spending by 0.4 percent. In the
previous year that ended in March, big firms cut capital spending
by 17 percent.
 Japan's first-quarter economic growth outpaced that of the
United States and Europe on solid exports to Asia. The rebound in
exports has led to a bottoming out in capital spending.
 But falling shipments and rising inventory in May signalled
the benefits of a rebound in exports may be moderating. Analysts
say growth will likely slow this year as the impact of subsidies
on energy-efficient goods fades.
 The sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the
percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those
who say they are good. Negative readings mean pessimists
outnumber optimists.

 SYDNEY, July 1 (Reuters) - The euro held gains on Thursday,
on relief that funding strains amongst euro zone banks were not
as bad as previously thought, but risk sentiment remained dour
after U.S. stocks took a late hit.
 Investors are anxious ahead of the release of the Chinese
purchasing manager index (PMI) around 0100 GMT. There are fears
growth could have slowed for a second straight month in June as
policies to curb lending in the red-hot property sector weighed
on manufacturing. [ID:nTOE65R01K]
 Such an outcome could weigh down further on commodity-linked
currencies like the Australian dollar  and see the yen
 make gains on the crosses as investors cut leveraged
trades.
 There was better news from Japan with the tankan index of big
manufacturers rising to +1 in June, above forecasts of -4 and the
highest reading in two years. [ID:nTKU106107]
 In Asian trade, the euro  was at $1.2225, having gained
about 0.4 percent on Wednesday. Despite its latest bounce, the
the euro lost more than 9 percent last quarter, the third
straight quarterly decline. It faces trendline resistance around
$1.2360 in the near term.
 It gained on Wednesday after euro zone banks borrowed less
money than expected from the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB
said 171 banks borrowed 131.9 billion euros over three months,
which was below expectations of 210 billion euros.
[ID:nLDE65T1YT]
 The amount is still the highest ever borrowed in a
three-month operation but pales beside the 442 billion euros of
one-year money which banks must repay to the ECB on Thursday.
 Spanish, Portuguese and Greek banks have been the biggest
users of the facilities. Gains in the euro were, however, limited
after Moody's Investors Service said it may cut Spain's Aaa
sovereign debt ratings on deteriorating economic growth
prospects. [ID:nN30242422].
 Market focus now turns to the ECB's 6-day tender later in the
session. Expectations are that the tender will be subscribed to
the tune of 75-125 billion euros. A lower-than-expected level of
subscription could underpin the euro.
 ""In addition, Spain's five-year bond auction requires
attention especially following the news on the possible downgrade
in the country's rating,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 Against the yen, the euro was steady at 108.16 yen
, having gained 0.25 percent on Wednesday.
 The dollar was steady against the yen at 88.40 yen ,
having shed 0.2 percent in the previous session, with support
still at 88 yen, the low on May 6. Traders in Tokyo also said
there was talk of dollar/yen options barrier at 88 yen.
 The dollar fell on Wednesday after a report showed U.S.
private employers added a paltry 13,000 jobs in June, raising
concerns about the outlook for the U.S. economy. [ID:nWEN6511]

(Updates with rival group's letter)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters) - A broad coalition of U.S.
business groups on Wednesday came out strongly against a bill
that would allow the United States to use import duties as
leverage against China's exchange rate policy.
 ""We agree that China needs an exchange rate that better
responds to global trade flows,"" the U.S.-China Business
Council and about two dozen other groups said in a letter to
each member of the Senate.
 ""We strongly disagree that legislation is the best means to
achieve that goal,"" the groups said.
 Hours later, a second coalition representing U.S. labor
groups and import-sensitive sectors such as steel and textiles
sent their own letter urging approval of the bill.
 The Fair Currency Coalition said approval of the bill was
needed to offset China's unfair trade advantage and give the
United States more negotiating leverage.
 The flurry of correspondence came as chances were dwindling
the Senate would vote on the measure before next week's
Independence Day break.
 Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, had vowed to
bring the bill to the floor as early as this week.
 He and other senators complain that China's currency
remains undervalued by as much as 25 percent to 40 percent,
even after recent reforms.
 Their bill would allow U.S. companies to request
anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports from China to
offset the effect of its ""undervalued"" currency.
 The first coalition of business groups, which also included
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said they strongly opposed that
idea for a number of reasons, including that it probably
violated World Trade Organization rules.
 Also, estimating the correct value of China's currency
""would be inherently subjective, unilateral and potentially
politicized since there is no agreed upon method to determine
what a country's exchange rate should be in the absence of a
market-based determination,"" the group said.
 The second coalition, whose members include the American
Iron and Steel Institute and the National Council of Textile
Organizations, said the International Monetary Fund had a long
history of calculating correct currency values.
 They also disputed the claim Schumer's bill would violate
WTO rules.
 ""The Chamber (of Commerce) and other signatories are
arguing for a continuation of the status quo. More offshoring.
More job losses. More time and effort wasted in negotiating
without leverage,"" the group said.

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - World stocks closed out a
dismal second quarter on Wednesday with a late-day sell-off
after Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it may downgrade
Spain's AAA credit rating and on persistent worries about
global growth.
Fresh banking and sovereign debt stress in Europe and
growing fears of a ""double-dip"" recession for the global
economy have gripped investors again in June's final days.
 MSCI's world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which has lost
more than 10 percent since April and is down more than 7
percent over the first six months of 2010, dropped 0.66
percent after losing more than 3 percent on Tuesday. The
global index has recorded its worst quarter since the final
three months of 2008 when the demise of Lehman Brothers sent
world markets and the economy into a tailspin.
 All three major U.S. stock indexes finished Wednesday's
session down roughly 1 percent or more. The Dow Jones
industrial average <.DJI> slid 96.28 points, or 0.98 percent,
to 9,774.02, while the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> shed 10.53 points, or 1.01 percent, to 1,030.71. The
Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> lost 25.94 points, or 1.21
percent, to 2,109.24.
 At the end of the second quarter, Wall Street was in
correction mode, with the Dow losing 10 percent in the April
through June period, while the S&P 500 shed 12 percent and the
Nasdaq also lost 12 percent. Wall Street defines a correction
as a drop of 10 percent or more from a recent peak.
 MOODY'S WARNING ON SPAIN
 Late Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service said it may cut
Spain's Aaa local and foreign currency government bond ratings
after a three-month review. Moody's said the possible
downgrade reflects deteriorating short-term and long-term
economic growth prospects, and the challenges the government
faces in achieving its fiscal targets. The rating agency also
cited concerns over the impact of rising funding costs over
the medium term.
 That gave investors even more reason to bid farewell to
the first half of the year.
 ""The recent market decline reflects a needed dose of
skepticism,"" said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at
RidgeWorth Investments in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees
$63 billion. ""We remain cautiously positive on the economy and
believe better investment opportunities will develop, but our
equity allocations remain closer to neutral over the near
term.""
 That sentiment is shared worldwide. Investors are entering
the second half of 2010 in a highly cautious mood, taking
equity exposure to its lowest level in well over a year and a
half, Reuters polls showed on Wednesday. For more details
please click on [ID:nLDE65T0EP].
 It wasn't all bad news today. The Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago Inc said on Wednesday its business
barometer fell to 59.1 in June from 59.7 in May, but that was
still slightly above economists' expectations. A reading
greater than 50 signals expansion.
 This week, worries that the expiration of some 442 billion
euros of one-year emergency ECB loans would leave many
strapped European banks with severe financing difficulties
eased a little after a replacement 3-month operation saw less
of a scramble for funds than feared.
 ""It's definitely a good sign and means there is still some
interbank lending occurring within the European money market,
and that it's not just a vertical relationship between banks
and the ECB,"" said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche Bank.
 The ECB said 171 banks borrowed 131.9 billion euros
($161.4 billion) over three months at a flat rate of 1 percent
-- below expectations for demand of 210 billion euros.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
slipped 0.23 percent to close at 993.49 points, a three-week
low. The benchmark index ended the torrid quarter with a loss
of 7.9 percent, its worst quarterly performance since the
first quarter of 2009.
 ECB relief and slightly higher short-term interest rates
due to the week's net drain of emergency funds helped push the
euro  sharply higher. It rallied almost 1 percent after
two days of steep losses, gaining more than 1 percent on
sterling. In New York trading, the euro was up 0.44 percent at
$1.2233 from a previous session close of $1.2179.
 NEW QUARTER'S BRUSH WITH THE BEARS
 The mood remained cautious going into the second half of
the year.
 Looming publication of European bank stress test results
next month have added to nerves about the sector. The
Bundesbank said on Wednesday that German banks have agreed to
participate in EU-wide stress tests once detailed parameters
are published.
 Alongside European banking and sovereign debt jitters and
the calendar stresses of the half-year mark, investors are
increasingly fearful for global economic growth after a series
of downbeat reports from the United States and China.
 Wednesday data showed U.S. private payroll gains were
muted in June, rising just 13,000, as small businesses cut
jobs, according to payroll giant ADP.
 ""Markets are very sensitive to any signs that growth is
failing,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB
Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 Not coincidentally, investors rushed into their favorite
safe haven security, U.S. Treasuries.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 4/32, with the yield at 2.94 percent, while the 30-year
U.S. Treasury bond  was up 22/32, with the yield at
3.89 percent.
 But on the short end of the yield curve, the 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.61
percent.
 In currencies, the dollar was up against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
up 0.02 percent at 86.043 from a previous session close of
86.025.
The euro was up 0.44 percent at $1.2233 from a previous
session close of $1.2179.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was down 0.16
percent at 88.40 from a previous session close of 88.540.
In the energy market, U.S. light sweet crude oil 
fell 31 cents, or 0.41 percent, to settle at $75.63 per
barrel.
 Other commodities held their own, however. Spot gold
prices  rose $1.25, or 0.10 percent, to $1,241.70. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB> was up 2.25 points, or 0.88
percent, at 258.52.
 For the second quarter, gold and the dollar gained, while
oil and stocks fell.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slumped to
to a three-week low against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday as
expectations of higher interest rates were pared back further
after data showed the Canadian economy stalled unexpectedly in
April.
 Government data showed real gross domestic product in
Canada was flat in April after seven straight months of
expansion, disappointing market expectations for 0.2 percent
growth and casting doubt on the pace of interest rate hikes by
the Bank of Canada. [ID:nN30434455]
 Currencies usually strengthen as interest rates rise as
higher rates attract capital flows.
 Expectations for a Bank of Canada rate rise in July, as
measured by yields on overnight index swaps, dropped to around
50 percent on Wednesday from around 80 percent just last week.

 The Canadian dollar  touched C$1.0649 to the U.S.
dollar, or 93.91 U.S. cents, late in the session, its lowest
point since June 7.
 It finished not far off the intraday low at C$1.0646 to the
U.S. dollar, or 93.93 U.S. cents, down from Tuesday's finish of
C$1.0553 to the U.S. dollar, or 94.76 U.S. cents.
 For the quarter, the Canadian dollar is off nearly 5
percent, falling from a perch near U.S. dollar parity, as
European debt concerns and evidence of an uneven global
economic recovery have taken a toll.
 ""There were a number of moving parts for the Canadian
dollar today, led by the softer-than-expected GDP number,"" said
Jack Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange at National
Bank Financial.
 He also pointed to news that Moody's Investors Service said
it may cut Spain's debt rating, reviving worries about Europe's
debt troubles, and said the Canadian dollar also tracked a
steep fall in U.S. equity markets. The commodity-linked
currency was further pressured by a lower oil price.
 The currency switched tracks after the GDP data. Earlier in
the day, it was firmer as jitters about bank funding in the
euro zone eased. [ID:nLDE65T0VB]
 Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities,
said the outlook for the Canadian dollar is weaker and that it
could easily fall to C$1.12 to C$1.15 to the U.S. dollar.
 ""The risk reward suggests to us that there's a lot less
upside in the Canadian dollar relatively to the downside
potential from here so we favor buying U.S. dollars and selling
Canada,"" he said.
 Spitz said risk was also being pulled ahead of Thursday's
market holiday in Canada and Friday's June nonfarm payrolls
data in the United States.
 U.S. jobs are forecast to have fallen in June for the first
time this year as many of the 411,000 temporary workers hired
in May to complete the census were laid off. [ID:nN29266671]
 BONDS FLAT
 Canadian government bonds closed flat after big gains
earlier in the session that were triggered by the GDP data as
traders squared positions ahead of the U.S. jobs figures.
 The two-year government bond  climbed 3 Canadian
cents to yield 1.391 percent, while the 10-year bond
 was up 4 Canadian cents to yield 3.087 percent.
 Canadian bonds were mixed against U.S. Treasury issues,
with short-term bonds outperforming and long-dated issues
underperforming. The Canadian 10-year bond yield was 14.9
basis points above its U.S. counterpart, compared with 13.9
basis points in the previous session.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2010 03:52PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Obama: Pressing China on currency to make trade fair," (Adds more Obama comment, background)
 By Steve Holland
 RACINE, Wis., June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack
Obama on Wednesday maintained pressure on China to ensure its
currency policy did not give it an unfair export advantage.
 ""We've got to make sure that countries we're trading with
are being fair. I believe in free trade,"" Obama said at a
campaign-style meeting in Racine, Wisconsin.
 ""For example, if China has a currency that's undervalued,
that makes our exports more expensive. It makes their imports
cheaper. So we've been putting pressure on them to say, you
know what, let's make sure that we're not favoring one side or
the other in this trade deal,"" he said.
 China has announced plans to allow its currency to be more
flexible, and Obama said at a weekend Group of 20 meeting in
Toronto he believed the yuan would rise significantly.
 During the summit he also announced a new push on a
long-stalled trade deal with South Korea.
 The United States argues the yuan is under-valued by up to
40 percent against the dollar, claiming this makes its exports
unfairly competitive and effectively poaches American jobs.
 Trade is a delicate topic for Obama, whose Democratic Party
draws support from organized labor, which complains that trade
deals with Mexico and Canada have hurt U.S. workers.
 Racine, perched on Lake Michigan and with unemployment
above 14 percent, typifies middle-American communities where
employers have been hit by cheap imports and the loss of jobs
overseas -- a fact Obama acknowledged.
 ""It is absolutely true that a lot of our manufacturing left
to go to China and other low-wage countries,"" Obama said.
 Jobs, and a general wariness toward free trade agreements
with foreign countries, will be a crucial factor in U.S.
mid-term congressional elections on Nov. 2, when anger over
still-high U.S. unemployment could erode the power of Obama's
Democrats.
 The Obama administration must also deliver a semi-annual
currency report to the U.S. Congress that could name China a
currency manipulator, although the odds of it embarrassing
China this way have shrunk since Beijing made the yuan move.

 * EU won't contemplate for now, but may consider all options
* Talk of 1989's ""Brady Bond"" Latin America fix resurfaces
 
 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Latin America's lost decade of
default and stagnation ended in 1989 only after a U.S.-backed
restructuring of regional debts and some say this model should
be considered for debt-hobbled euro sovereigns such as Greece.
 Despite hundreds of billions of euros of European Union and
International Monetary Fund firepower marshalled in its support
over the past two months, Greece still cannot dispel creditor
concerns that, racked by austerity and starved of growth, it
will eventually have to restructure its huge national debts.
 Debt market pricing has deteriorated again in recent weeks
and indicates more than a 50 percent chance of a default over
five years. Polls and surveys of bankers show they see at least
a one in three chance of a debt restructuring over that period.
If Greece is forced kicking and screaming to default, the
precedent will inevitably raise fears that other highly indebted
euro sovereigns -- such as Ireland or Portugal -- will face a
similar fate. And that fear in itself risks becoming a
self-fulfilling prophecy as confidence drains.
 May's 110 billion euro ($134 billion) IMF/EU Greek bailout
fully funds Greece for 24 months but what happens to the country
after that? Will Greece be able to renew its access to markets
at remotely serviceable interest rates?
 Many think the specific Greek bailout and the wider euro
zone stabilisation plans should simply be used to buy time and
bring bank creditors to the table.
 Although EU policymakers dismiss any talk of restructuring,
private sector economists are already discussing scenarios. It's
most likely Brussels and EU capitals are listening attentively.
 
 BACK TO THE '80s
 So how does the Latin American experience inform 21st
century Europe and is it worth considering a reprise of the
""Brady Bonds""?
 After borrowing binge in the 1970s, Mexico and other Latin
countries were brutally sobered by the global recession of
1981/82 and could not service their debts. A Mexican debt
moratorium in 1982 set in chain events that stifled the whole
continent for another seven years.
 But in 1989, the Brady Initiative -- named after the first
U.S. President George Bush's Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady
-- broke a protracted cycle of country default, bank stress,
creditor boycotts and IMF bailouts.
 Its central idea was a comprehensive debt restructuring to
make Latin American countries creditworthy again over the long
term and involved banks typically writing off 30-35 percent of
original debts in return for a variety of new bonds tailored to
national circumstances and in some cases backed by U.S. Treasury
bonds. The United States then was effectively guarantor.
 By May 1994, 18 countries had Brady deals forgiving $60
billion of debt and representing about $190 billion in long-term
bank claims. Its success 20 years later is marked by the fact
few Brady bonds still exist. As economies improved, governments
bought back their Bradys and replaced them with orthodox bonds.
 Before May's series of euro zone bailouts, Jacob Kirkegaard,
economist at Washington's Peterson Institute, called for the EU
to consider a Brady-style plan for Greece involving the issue of
""Barroso Bonds"", after EU Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso.
 Designers of ""Barroso Bonds"", he said, could call for
haircuts for creditors but also provide incentives for them to
participate in an orderly restructuring or ""stay in and gain.""

 BARROSO BONDS?
""The biggest lesson learned from the Latin American debt
crisis was that if a comprehensive debt restructuring is needed,
it's much better to do a big one right from the start,"" said
Brown Brothers Harriman economist Win Thin.
 Famously bearish U.S. economist Nouriel Roubini agrees and
wrote of Greece this week: ""It would be better to use a small
amount of public money to tempt creditors into a pre-emptive
deal now than waste 110 billion euros of it trying to prevent an
unavoidable restructuring later.""
 Avinash Persaud, chairman of Intelligence Capital, said last
month's 750 billion euro zone stabilisation plan should have
involved a Greek debt swap that would effectively give creditors
a 30 percent ""haircut"" but cut market uncertainty considerably.
 ""The solution is akin to Brady bonds,"" Persaud said, adding
debt swaps could leave principal unchanged but extend maturities
and cut coupons -- which would even then make the debt more
valuable to banks than if they realised market prices today.
 ""Commitments to protect the creditors in full in the short
run will merely undermine them in the long run. A mechanism
which meant the choice for bond holders was not 100 percent or
zero would calm markets and introduce some market discipline for
all euro zone members.""
 JPMorgan Asset Management said there is a question over who
would act as guarantor, as the United States did in the Brady
Plan, though others reckon the euro zone stabilisation programme
could fill that role.
 ""The most likely outcome appears to be a debt write-off,
coordinated by a central agency (ECB) but no issuance of
collateral,"" wrote JPAM's Brady market veteran Keith Swabey.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2010 02:48PM ET</span>","REFILE-Canada urged to ban asbestos mining, exports"," (Fixes spelling of Jeffrey Mine, paragraph 12)
 By Julie Gordon
 TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - A group of medical
associations on Wednesday called for a ban on asbestos mining
in Canada, which tightly restricts the use of the material but
allows it to be exported despite its health risks.
 The Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Public
Health Association and the National Specialty Society for
Community Medicine demanded that provincial and federal
governments stop funding the asbestos industry and promoting
Canadian asbestos abroad.
 Canada is the world's fifth largest exporter of chrysotile
asbestos. Two mines in the province of Quebec account for all
of the production.
 Once a commonly used building material, asbestos is
strictly regulated in Canada under the Hazardous Products Act
and the Environmental Protection Act.
 Asbestos exposure has been linked with lung and other
cancers. An estimated 90,000 people die from asbestos-related
illnesses every year, according the World Health Organization.
 Canada produced 180,000 tonnes of asbestos in 2009, 96
percent of which was exported to 80 countries around the world,
with Asia being the primary market, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey.
 The Canadian government, in a legal document on the website
of the auditor general, said it ""encouraged"" countries that
import Canadian asbestos to follow the 1986 Geneva conventions
on asbestos use and regulation.
 In India, where more than 300,000 tonnes of asbestos was
imported in 2007, chrysotile asbestos is routinely used in
roofing, and no license is required to import the mineral,
according to The Lancet, a British health journal.
 Jeffrey Turnbull, president-elect of the CMA, said the
Canadian government does not require exported asbestos to bear
a hazardous material label.
 ""It's a challenge to understand why in Canada we restrict
asbestos as a hazardous product,"" said Turnbull in a telephone
interview from his Ottawa office. ""Yet we then will export
(asbestos) to other settings across the world where there is
not the same degree of health protections in place.""
 MINE EXPANSION
 Asbestos, Quebec is awaiting the provincial government's
approval of a C$58 million ($54.7 million) loan guarantee to
revive the privately owned Jeffrey Asbestos mine, one of the
world's largest open-pit asbestos operations.
 The loan, combined with a labor deal to establish a C$10
million reserve fund from workers salaries, will provide cash
to expand underground operations at the 130-year-old mine.
 The expansion will create an estimated 400 direct jobs in
Asbestos, a town of 6,800 located 150 km east of Montreal, and
will enable the mine to produce enough asbestos to keep Canada
in the market for the next 25 years.
 Critics say Quebec should focus on more sustainable
industries, instead of approving the loan guarantee to save the
Jeffrey Asbestos mine.
 ""The decision is simple,"" said Matthew Hodge, president of
the National Specialty Society for Community Medicine, in a
press release. ""Invest taxpayer's dollars to diversify the
regions and to retrain those currently employed by the
declining asbestos industry.""
 The owner of the Jeffrey asbestos mine, Bernard Coulombe,
was not immediately available for comment.
 A representative of the Chrysotile Institute, a Canadian
organization that lobbies on behalf of asbestos producers
around the world, was also not available for comment.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro rose across the
board on Wednesday after banks borrowed less money than
expected from the European Central Bank, soothing concerns over
European banks' funding issues.
 The tender results were keenly awaited as a gauge of how
reliant European banks are on ECB emergency funding. Spanish,
Portuguese and Greek banks have been the biggest users of the
facilities.
 Despite Wednesday's gains, the euro remains on track for a
loss of 9.3 percent this quarter, the third straight quarterly
decline. The single currency hit a four-year low around $1.1875
on June 7.
 ""The much less-than-expected requirement for ECB funding is
significant, as it suggests that difficulties throughout
euro-zone financial institutions were not as bad as originally
feared,"" said Jamie Heighway, a market analyst at Custom House,
a Western Union company, in Victoria, British Columbia.
 ""Cleary a relief for investors at least over the short
term,"" he added.
 The ECB lent banks 131.9 billion euros ($161.4 billion) in
three-month funds, well below expectations of demand of 210
billion euros, according to a Reuters poll. Banks face the
repayment of close to half a trillion euros in 12-month funds
on Thursday. [ID:nLDE65T0VB]
 The euro hit a session high of $1.2304 , according to
Reuters data, rebounding from a two-week low hit on Tuesday. It
last traded at $1.2262, up 0.7 percent.
 Option dealers are indicating expiries at 1.2300, 1.2320/25
and 1.2350 during the day.
 The single European currency also rose 1.4 percent against
sterling .
 Flows related to the end of the month, quarter and half
year affected price movements in thin trade, traders said.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.8 percent at 108.65 yen
,after hitting an 8-1/2-year low on Tuesday.
 However, for the year-to-date, the euro is still down 14.3
percent against the U.S. currency, down 18.3 percent against
the yen and down 10.9 percent versus the Swiss franc 
 ""The euro has a long way to go in attempting to buck the
current downtrend,"" Heighway said. The euro needs to first test
trendline resistance around $1.2360 before any chance of taking
out the $1.24 figure and beyond, he added.
 RISK STAYS HIGH
 Against the yen, the dollar was little changed at 88.58
, after falling earlier on concerns about the outlook for
the U.S. economy following a report showed U.S. private
employers added a paltry 13,000 jobs in June. [ID:nWEN6511].
 The U.S. government's closely watched monthly nonfarm
payrolls data will be released on Friday.
 ""The downside surprise will be seen as taking away from any
upside nonfarm payroll surprise and is consistent with a labor
market that is lethargic at best, moribund at worst,"" said Alan
Ruskin, head of currency strategy, RBS Global Banking & Markets
in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Market players were cautious ahead of more events that
could pose a risk for the single currency, including the German
presidential election on Wednesday. [ID:nLDE65R0BY]

 * Austere UK and euro zone budget tightening ""will hurt""
 * High UK CPI pushing up price expectations, but manageable

(Adds economists' reaction, wraps in later comments)
 By David Milliken and Sumeet Desai
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker Adam
Posen said on Wednesday he was not ready to back interest rate
rises -- despite signs that inflation expectations are creeping
upward -- because of the risk of a return to recession.
 BoE policymaker Andrew Sentance unexpectedly voted to start
raising interest rates this month on the view that the economy
was much healthier than a year ago, sparking speculation that
the central bank may tighten policy sooner than expected.
 But in a speech on Wednesday Posen said unavoidable
austerity budgets in Britain and the euro zone meant there was
too big a risk that the UK would fail to benefit from recovery
in the rest of the world for rate rises to be appropriate now.
 ""The UK economy is potentially switching between two states:
a recovery, which we are now in, albeit perhaps an initially
weak one ... and the renewal of a severe recession if not
outright deflation,"" he said.
 Britain's Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition set out
the country's tightest budget in a generation last week, which
the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said on
Wednesday would lead to 600,000 public-sector job losses.
 ""We are about to enter a period of fiscal austerity at home
and in the euro area, our most important trading partner. We
should make no mistake -- this will hurt,"" Posen said.
 Economists said Posen's remarks, coming after dovish
comments from Monetary Policy Committee member Paul Fisher
released by the BoE late on Tuesday, reinforced their sense that
other policymakers would be slow to join Sentance in calling for
tighter policy.
 ""We still lean towards the view that interest rates will
stay down at 0.50 percent through 2010, although we accept that
a modest, token rise is possible,"" said Howard Archer, UK
economist at IHS Global Insight.
 
 HIGH INFLATION
 Part of the reason why Sentance voted for an increase in
interest rates from the record low of 0.5 percent where they
have remained since March last year is that British inflation
hit a 17-month high of 3.7 percent in April.
 This contrasts with a downward trend in the United States
and the euro zone, and Posen said he disagreed with BoE Governor
Mervyn King's view that the divergence was just due to one-off
shocks such as a rise in value-added tax and sterling weakness.
 ""The only place where I would point to or acknowledge a
direct difference with the Governor is this issue of how much,
looking backwards, you want to say that this was just a series
of one-time shocks,"" he said.
 ""I am forced to consider changes in the anchoring of
inflation expectations as the source of the upward creep we have
seen in UK inflation of late,"" he said.
 But he went on to argue that a slow upward creep in
inflation expectations was not sufficient grounds to tighten
policy while it was still unclear whether growth would persist.
 Household inflation expectations had only risen so far on
short-term measures, and not on a five-year horizon, while
financial market measures of inflation expectations did not yet
show a strong rise, he told reporters after the speech.
 If growth did continue, Posen said it would not be hard to
bring inflation and price expectations back down.
 ""If we end up overshooting inflation because we end up
happily in the good (growth) outcome, then I am very confident
we can bring it back down. We know how to do that,"" he said.
 ""That would result in more inflation overshooting in the
interim, given our policy stance, and in that state of affairs I
would be only too happy to vote for an interest rate increase.""
 Posen said it was too early to judge the precise impact of
Britain's budget on the economy, but said fiscal tightening was
unavoidable for the UK, and that its scale was not a surprise.
 King said before the budget, at a speech attended by finance
minister George Osborne, that monetary policy must be set in the
light of fiscal policy, and that inflation was already falling.
 If inflation looked like it would fall too far, Posen said
the central bank could add to the 200 billion pounds of asset
purchases already made under its quantitative easing programme,
though he was less certain how effective this would be.
 ""Go to the Governor's Mansion House speech, go to David
Miles's speech earlier this year. Both of them express a strong
conviction, with strong theoretical arguments, as to why you
could continually expand QE without limit,"" he said.
 ""Speaking personally for myself alone ... I'm a little bit
more humble about the capabilities of that policy. But that is
moot. If that is what we have available, and the shock is
deflationary, then that is what we use.""

member states paid prohibited export subsidies to aerospace
group Airbus and must withdraw them, a World Trade Organization
dispute panel said on Wednesday.
 Here is a timeline of the long running dispute.
 
 Oct. 2004 - Washington files a case challenging European
loans to help Airbus develop aircraft and terminates a 1992
civil aircraft agreement covering government support for the two
top aircraft manufacturers.
 -- The EU files a counter-complaint against U.S. support for
Boeing. 
 Dec. 2004 - Airbus wins shareholder approval to start
seeking orders for a fuel-saving, wide-body jet to be called the
A350, unleashing a fresh marketing battle against Boeing. 
 -- Airbus says it is entitled to apply for a third of the
A350 development cost under a 1992 European Union-United States
trade deal, but Boeing maintains that deal is dead. 
 May 2005 - The U.S. reactivates its WTO case against
European subsidies for Airbus after fresh efforts to reach a
negotiated settlement with Brussels fail. The EU says the next
day it will reactivate its legal case against U.S. support for
aircraft maker Boeing in a tit-for-tat riposte.
 July 2005 - The WTO launches twin probes into state aid for
Boeing and Airbus in what is billed as the biggest trade
dogfight ever.
 July 2006 - Airbus unveils a $10 billion revamp of its
planned A350 jets and says it will seek government aid from its
partner countries, France, Germany, Spain and Britain. 
 June 15, 2009 - Airbus takes a step closer to winning
government loans as France, Germany, Britain and Spain say they
aim to decide by the end of June how much money they are
prepared to put up to help the A350 project. 
 -- Germany says it is prepared to provide 1.1 billion euros
($1.5 billion) and France would contribute 1.4 billion. 
 -- Boeing says government financing would violate WTO rules.
 Aug. 14, 2009 - Britain says it will pledge 340 million
pounds ($510 million) in loans. 
 Aug 27, 2009 - Boeing says it hopes the preliminary WTO
panel ruling will force European governments to reconsider plans
to help finance Airbus A350 jet. 
 Sept. 4, 2009 - WTO panel issues interim ruling in U.S. case
against Airbus to the parties. Various sources say the panel
found EU aid amounted to unfair subsidies and in some cases
violated a tougher ban on export subsidies, but rejected some
U.S. complaints.
 March 8, 2010 - Northrop Grumman, bidding for a $50 billion
U.S. refuelling aircraft contract with EADS, withdraws from the
tanker contest leaving the field open to Boeing, and prompting
complaints of U.S. protectionism by EU leaders.
 March 22 - Germany confirms it is ready to provide 1.1
billion euros of funding to Airbus for the A350.
 March 23 - The WTO rules that European governments have
provided a ""certain element of subsidy"" to Airbus. Despite the
ruling, future funding plans for the next model of Airbus
aircraft, the A350, will not be affected, Airbus says in a
comment sure to be contested by Boeing.
 June 30 - A WTO dispute panel says the EU and some of its
member states paid prohibited export subsidies to aerospace
group Airbus and must withdraw them.
 -- The WTO said the prohibited subsidies should be halted
immediately and says this means 90 days; but the legal process
could mean months or years before this deadline is reached.
 -- The panel agrees that support for the Airbus A300, A310,
A320, A330, A340, A380 airliners constitutes launch aid. The
panel did not agree that support for the A350 is launch aid, as
it did not examine the A350 programme, launched after the
complaint was filed.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2010 11:44AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Subsidies and the WTO -- issue at heart of Airbus case," June 30 (Reuters) - Subsidies are at the heart of the case
brought by the United States over EU funding for Airbus, in
which a WTO panel gave a ruling on Wednesday.
 * The WTO agreement on subsidies distinguishes between two
categories: prohibited and actionable.
 
 * Prohibited subsidies require recipients to meet certain
export targets or use domestic goods instead of imported goods.
They are prohibited in every case because they specifically aim
to distort trade.
 They can be challenged in the WTO's dispute settlement
system, where they are subject to an accelerated process.
 If the WTO dispute panel confirms that a subsidy is
prohibited, it must be withdrawn immediately, otherwise the
complaining country can take counter-measures.
 * In the Airbus case the WTO panel found that Airbus had
indeed received prohibited export subsidies, and called for them
to be withdrawn within 90 days.
 * Actionable subsidies require the complaining country to
show that the subsidy is hurting it, otherwise such a subsidy is
allowed.
 It defines three types of damage:
 -- A subsidy can hurt domestic industry in an importing
country;
 -- It can hurt rival exporters trying to compete in third
markets;
 -- And it can hurt exporters trying to compete in the
subsidising country's domestic market.
 If the WTO dispute system confirms that a subsidy is having
an adverse effect, it must be withdrawn, or the adverse effect
must be removed.
 * In this case the WTO panel found that number of
transactions, including some infrastructure spending and

"
837,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2010 11:36AM ET</span>",Q&A-What next in the Airbus dispute?," June 30 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization panel issued
a damning report on Wednesday in the dispute between the United
States and European Union over EU subsidies for Airbus civil
aircraft.
 What happens next?
 * Does Airbus have to repay the subsidies?
 The WTO does not usually require subsidies that have already
been handed out to be repaid.
 But it does require an immediate end to prohibited export
subsidies and the withdrawal of other subsidies or their adverse
effects on the United States.
 
 * Does it mean the export subsidies have to stop
immediately?
 The WTO panel defined immediately as ""within 90 days"". But
that is within 90 days of its report being ""adopted"" -- approved
by the entire WTO membership, which could be some months away.
 Cases involving prohibited export subsidies enjoy an
accelerated process at the WTO.
 A report is adopted within 30 days of being circulated --
unless it is appealed. (In other cases the deadline is 60 days.)
The appeal can be at the last minute. The EU is likely to appeal
as it has nothing to lose and will gain time.
 The WTO's appellate body then has 60 days to rule (against
90 days in cases not involving prohibited subsidies).
 The appellate body's report must be adopted within 20 days
(against 30 days in other cases).
 If the case is complex the appellate body -- the WTO's top
court -- may take longer. The original panel was supposed to
produce its report within 90 days and took nearly five years.
 
 * How does Airbus end the prohibited subsidies and withdraw
the other ones?
 The WTO did not make any specific recommendations on this.
 In practice Airbus would probably have to put outstanding
loans and other funding onto a commercial footing, for instance
renegotiating the interest it pays.
 
 * Can Airbus subsidise other planes?
 The report covers funding for Airbus between 2001 and 2006,
so it does not look at funding for its new A350 widebody jet.
 Airbus is currently negotiating loans to pay for the A350.
 U.S. and Boeing officials say the ruling will ensure these
are not unfair subsidies too.
 What is certain is that American lawywers will scrutinise
the funding of the A350 and any other Airbus planes, and if they
think it is unfair and launch a new challenge, they will be able
to cite case law from this dispute.
 
 * How does it affect the U.S. military tanker contest
 Airbus parent EADS is bidding against Boeing to win a $50
billion contract to supply tankers to the U.S. Air Force. The
EADS bid is based on the A330, which the WTO panel found had
been illegally subsidised.
 Boeing is making the most of this to argue that the EADS bid
is unfair, but it remains to be seen whether this will sway the
Pentagon.
 * What about other countries?
 Boeing officials say this case will also lay down a marker
for countries like Brazil, Canada, China and Russia that are
thinking of entering the large civil aircraft market.
 * So is this the end of the road for Airbus?
 The confidential interim report in the EU's countersuit
against the United States over subsidies for Boeing is now
expected on July 16. The final report could be published later
this year or early next.
 That is likely to find the U.S. guilty of illegal practices
too -- although Boeing officials insist the EU subsidies are
much more serious than what is at stake with Boeing.
 At that point the two parties may decide to negotiate a
settlement to their differences over the funding of large civil
aircraft, although the WTO rulings will still be available to
other countries that want to challenge them.

838,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2010 11:16AM ET</span>",POLL-Top forecasters show no bias on June U.S. payrolls," BANGALORE, June 30 (Reuters) - Forecasters who have given
the most accurate predictions for U.S. non-farm payrolls over
the past year are giving no clear directional steer on where the
risk lies for the June report due for release on Friday.
 Financial markets are bracing for a weak report after
digesting several other reports on the U.S. economy since the
forecasts were provided, including a much weaker than expected
ADP employment report on Wednesday. [ID:nN30220164]
 According to an analysis carried out by Reuters, the median
prediction of 18 of the top 20 most accurate forecasters for
U.S. payrolls shows a loss of 105,000 jobs compared with a net
loss of 110,000 from a wider survey of 73 economists.
 The difference between the two samples this time is very
small compared with prior analysis. Indeed, the mean average of
the most accurate forecasters shows a slightly bleaker outlook
than the straight consensus, at 112,000 job losses.
 The selected Top 20 group of economists has correctly
predicted directional surprise in nine of the past 14 releases,
including calling the May figures, which came in significantly
weaker than expected and moved financial markets.
 Economists in the wider Reuters poll expect anywhere between
a rise of 30,000 to a fall of 200,000. But none of the Top 20
group predicted net jobs growth last month, with forecasts
ranging from a fall of 30,000 and a 200,000-job decline.

"
839,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2010 11:12AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Main conclusions of WTO panel on Airbus aid," June 30 (Reuters) - The following are the main conclusions
of the World Trade Organization panel that ruled in the
complaint brought by the United States against the European
Union over aid for Airbus  civil aircraft.
 The report, of more than 1,000 pages, was published on
Wednesday after being issued confidentially to the United States
and EU on March 23. The panel, which was chaired by Uruguay's
former ambassador to the WTO, Carlos Perez del Castillo, was
formed in 2005.
 The United States had complained that the development and
marketing of Airbus airliners was only possible thanks to a
programme of ""launch aid"" and other financial support by the EU
and some of its member states on non-commercial terms.
 It said this aid comprised illegal subsidies, which hurt the
U.S. civil aircraft industry by depriving it of market share.
 
 ""LAUNCH AID""
 * The panel agreed that support for the Airbus A300, A310,
A320, A330, A340, A380 airliners constituted launch aid.
 * It did not agree that support for the A350 was launch aid,
as it did not examine the A350 programme, launched after the
complaint was filed.
 * It found that the United States had not proved that there
was a coherent, systematic launch aid programme.
 SUBSIDIES
 * The panel found that German, British and Spanish funding
for the A380 airliner amounted to de facto export subsidies.
 * It disagreed that French aid for the A330, A340 and A380
and Spanish aid for the A340 were export subsidies.
 * It did not agree that the export subsidies were based on a
legal requirement to export -- i.e. that funding was formally
conditional on achieving exports.
 * It disagreed that loans by the European Investment Bank
(EIB) to the Airbus programme amounted to specific subsidies
under WTO rules.
* It found that some but not all infrastructure spending by
member states was a specific subsidy to Airbus.
 * It found that the transfer of the German government's 20
percent stake in Deutsche Airbus to KfW, a state-owned bank, and
then to MBB, subsequently acquired by Daimler , was a
specific subsidy. In particular, KfW's sale of the stake in 1992
to MBB was below market rates.
 * It disagreed that debt forgiveness by the German
government was a specific subsidy.
 * It agreed that equity infusions by the French government
and Credit Lyonnais were specific subsidies.
 * It agreed that the 1998 transfer of the French state's 46
percent state in Dassault Aviation to Aerospatiale was a
specific subsidy.
 * It agreed that some but not all research and development
spending on the Airbus programme was a specific subsidy. (The
panel estimated the total value of R&D spending at about 750
million euros, against a U.S. claim of 2 billion euros and an EU
estimate of 381 million euros.)
 MARKET IMPACT
 * The panel found that Boeing's  share of sales of
large civil aircraft to the EU market declined while Airbus's
increased over the period under review (2001-2006)
* It found that imports of Boeing to the EU were displaced
by Airbus.
 * It found that Airbus displaced Boeing sales in Australia,
China, and India, and to a lesser extent in Brazil, Mexico,
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
 * It found that the United States did not prove that Airbus
had undercut prices.
 * It agreed the Airbus programme had led to the suppression
or depression of prices for Boeing 737, 767 and 747 airliners
but not the Boeing 777. (Suppression is when prices are
prevented from rising, depression when they are pushed down.)
* It agreed with the United States that launch aid shifted
the risk of launching aircraft to the government from the
manufacturer through non-commercial funding.
 * It agreed with the United States that Airbus's ability to
launch each model was dependent on subsidies.
 * It agreed that Airbus could not have marketed planes when
it did without specific subsidies from the EU, Britain France,
Germany and Spain.
 * It concluded that if Airbus had launched and marketed the
planes without subsidies it would have been a much different and
weaker company.
* It found that without subsidies Airbus would not have had
the market share it did in 2001-2006.
 * It found that without the Airbus subsidies, the United
States would have had a bigger share in EU and third markets.
 * It found that Airbus's market share was a result of
subsidies.
 * It disagreed with the United States that the subsidies
allowed Airbus to price more aggressively (i.e. any suppression
or depression of prices was not caused by subsidies).
 IMPACT ON U.S. INDUSTRY
 * It agreed that the subsidies had displaced Boeing in EU
and third markets, causing ""serious prejudice"" to the United
States.
 * It disagreed that the subsidies led to price undercutting,
suppression or depression.
 * It found that Boeing recovered in 2005-2006 after
performing poorly in 2001-2003 so there was no material injury
to U.S. domestic industry.
* It found that the EU had nullified and impaired benefits
to the United States that it was entitled to under WTO
agreements.
 RECOMMENDATIONS
 * The panel recommended that prohibited export subsidies be
withdrawn ""without delay"" and said this meant within 90 days of
adoption of its report by the WTO.
 * It said the EU should remove the adverse effects of
subsidies or withdraw subsidies causing adverse effects.
 * It made no recommendations on how the EU should do this
(and the United States. did not ask for recommendations)

 WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters) - The United States won a
landmark victory at the World Trade Organization in Boeing's

 A second panel is expected to release a confidential

 At the heart of the U.S. case was a complaint that European
government ""launch aid"" loans were illegal subsidies.
 ""What emerges clear as day from this panel report is that
Europe has never been able to provide launch aid in a manner
that is consistent with its WTO obligations,"" USTR General
Counsel Tim Reif said.

(Adds market activity, U.S. lawmakers' demand)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 30 (Reuters) - World Trade Organization judges
gave the European Union a stinging rebuke on Wednesday, saying
the EU must axe prohibited export subsidies to plane-maker
Airbus which had injured U.S. rival Boeing.
 The WTO panel concluded Airbus had been able to launch a
series of passenger jets only thanks to subsidies from the EU
and member states Britain, France, Germany and Spain, without
which it would be a very different and much weaker company.
 The ruling marks a big setback for Airbus, but is not the
end of its battle -- the world's largest and costliest trade
dispute -- with Boeing over subsidies in the market for large
civil aircraft worth $3 trillion over the next 20 years.
 ""These subsidies have greatly harmed the United States,
including causing Boeing to lose sales and market share.
Today's ruling helps level the competitive playing field with
Airbus,"" U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a
statement.
 ""President Obama and I are committed to enforcing our trade
agreements and, when necessary, using the dispute settlement
process that is consistent with the rules-based global trading
system at the World Trade Organization.""
 If the ruling is upheld on appeal and the EU refuses to
stop the offending practices, the United States could ask the
WTO for permission to slap sanctions on EU goods.
 The WTO panel found that British, German and Spanish aid to
Airbus for its flagship 525-seat A380, the world's largest
airliner, amounted to illegal export subsidies and must be
corrected within 90 days. Boeing estimated the loans at $4
billion but Airbus declined to provide an estimate.
 The WTO found that British, Spanish and German loans for
the A380 contained illegal export aid but cleared a French
loan.
 AIRBUS: NO REQUIREMENT
 Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus Americas, said the
company was not obligated to repay any subsidies found by the
WTO panel or any outstanding government loans.
 ""There is no requirement to repay anything in the WTO
process,"" McArtor said in an interview.
 The ruling, which Airbus hopes the EU will appeal, only
imposes a future obligation on European governments that
provide launch aid, he said.
 Boeing said Airbus must repay $4 billion in illegal aid for
the A380 or ""restructure the A380's financing to proven
commercial terms.
 The European Commission said it would decide shortly
whether to appeal the 1,000-page Airbus ruling, and reiterated
a call for negotiations.
 ""The EU remains committed to a negotiated outcome to the
dispute with no pre-conditions on either side,"" EU Trade
Commissioner Karel De Gucht said in a statement in Brussels.
 The WTO said prohibited subsidies should be halted
immediately and said this meant 90 days; but the legal process
could mean months or years before this deadline is reached.
 Boeing shares in New York closed down 0.5 percent on
Wednesday at $62.75, outperforming a slightly weaker market.
In Europe, where markets closed shortly after the decision
was released, shares in Airbus parents EADS ended 0.8 percent
lower at 16.78 euros.
 TANKER DISPUTE
 Wednesday's report followed months of leaks and both sides
rushed out their interpretations even before the 1,050-page
documents were wheeled out on trolleys for reporters in
Geneva.
 A first confidential report in a countersuit brought by the
EU against U.S. support for Boeing is expected on July 16.
 Final resolution of the two cases may well shape the civil
aviation market, where Airbus and Boeing have together nearly
$1 trillion of aircraft on their order books, for years to
come.
 More immediately, it could fuel a row in the United States
over one of the biggest defense deals in history.
 Both Boeing and Airbus parent EADS are due to submit bids
by July 9 for a contract worth up to $50 billion for new
tankers for the U.S. Air Force, based on converted passenger
jets.
 The EADS offering is based on the Airbus A330 -- one of the
planes found to have been unfairly subsidised -- and Boeing is
already making much of this, although it remains to be seen to
what extent this will sway the Pentagon.
A group of U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday renewed a demand that
the Air Force factor the WTO ruling into their decision on the
tanker competition.
 Boeing said the ruling proved that Airbus had been able to
take market share from Boeing -- nudging it out of number one
place in the process -- only because of subsidies.
 ""It has struck at the heart of subsidies for Airbus, held
that they are illegal, and must end forthwith,"" Boeing general
counsel J. Michael Luttig told Reuters.
 FOCUS ON AIRBUS A350
 Airbus and France, where the company is based, said the
funding system itself, which is based on government loans to be
paid back as planes are sold, had not been faulted.
 ""Neither jobs nor any profits were lost as a result of
reimbursable loans to Airbus,"" the company said.
 The case did not cover Airbus's future A350 airliner, but
Boeing said the ruling would prevent European governments from
paying similar loans to develop that plane. Airbus denied this
and said it would press ahead with talks on setting up loans.
 U.S. trade officials said it would be very disappointing
for European governments to provide launch aid loans for the
A350 in light of the WTO's ruling.
 But Airbus' McArtor said European government have already
pledged they would make any new launch aid loans for Airbus
comply with WTO rules.
 ""If the USTR is disappointed in that, I'm sorry. That's the
way they do business in Europe and the panel found that such
loans are perfectly compliant ... as long as they are under
acceptable terms,"" McArtor said.
 The United States could demand to see the terms of any
loans for the A350 to ensure they do comply with the ruling,
said Robert Novick, a partner at WilmerHale who has represented
Boeing in the dispute.
 Both sides have 30 days to appeal the ruling.
 The report -- and its 90-day deadline to withdraw the
subsidies -- does not come into effect until it is officially
adopted by the WTO membership, after any appeal process.

 WASHINGTON, June 30 (Reuters) - A broad coalition of U.S.
business groups urged senators on Wednesday not to approve a
bill that would allow the United States to use import duties
against China's exchange rate policy.
 ""We agree that China needs an exchange rate that better
responds to global trade flows,"" the U.S.-China Business
Council and about two dozen other groups said in a letter to
each member of the Senate.
 ""We strongly disagree that legislation is the best means to
achieve that goal,"" the groups said.
 Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, has
threatened to bring a bill to the floor as early as this week.
 However, with Congress expected to recess on Friday for the
Independence Day holiday, time is dwindling for that.
 Schumer and a bipartisan group of senators complain that
China's exchange rate remains undervalued by as much as 25
percent to 40 percent, even after recent reforms.
 Their bill would allow U.S. companies to request
anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports from China to
offset the effect of its ""undervalued"" currency.
 The business groups, which also included the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said they strongly opposed that idea for a number
of reasons, including that it probably violated World Trade
Organization rules.
 Also estimating how the correct value of China's currency
""would be inherently subjective, unilateral and potentially
politicized since there is no agreed upon method to determine
what a country's exchange rate should be in the absence of a
market-based determination,"" the group said.

 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro gained broadly on
Wednesday after banks borrowed less funds than expected from
from the European Central Bank, easing concerns over European
banks' funding issues and raising risk appetite.
 The ECB lent banks 131.9 billion euros ($161.4 billion) in
three-month funds as banks face the repayment of close to half
a trillion euros in 12-month funds on Thursday. [ID:nLDE65T0VB]
 The tender results were keenly awaited as a gauge of how
reliant European banks are on ECB emergency funding. Spanish,
Portuguese and Greek banks have been the biggest users of the
facilities.
 The dollar fell against the yen on concerns about the
outlook for the economy after a report showed U.S. private
employers added a paltry 13,000 jobs in June, compared to a
revised gain of 57,000 in May. [ID:nWEN6511]. The U.S.
government's nonfarm payrolls data will be released on Friday.
 ""The fact that only 131.9 billion euros was borrowed by
banks in the euro zone implies that concerns that the expiry of
the one-year 442 billion euros on Thursday would cause a
liquidity crunch in the currency block are overdone,"" said
Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 The euro extended gains to hit the day's high of $1.2304
, according to Reuters data, and rebounding from a
two-week low  struck the previous day. It last traded at
$1.2256, up 0.7 percent.
 Option dealers are indicating expiries at 1.2300, 1.2320/25
and 1.2350 during the day.
 The single currency also rose more than 1 percent against
sterling .
 Flows related to the end of the month, quarter and half
year affected price movements in thin trade, traders said.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.7 percent at 108.63 yen
, after hitting an 8-1/2 year low the previous day.
 However, the euro is still down 14.4 percent against the
U.S. currency, down 18.3 percent against the yen and down 10.7
percent versus the Swiss franc  this year.
 The dollar was up against the yen but off the session high
after paring gains on the private payrolls report. It last
traded at 88.62 yen, up 0.1 percent, trading in a tight range
between 88.40 to 88.76  for the day. 
 ""Though often not a great predictor of private payrolls,
the downside surprise will be seen as taking away from any
upside non farm payroll surprise, and is consistent with a
labor market that is lethargic at best, moribund at worst,""
said Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy, RBS Global Banking
& Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
 RISK STAYS HIGH
 Market players were cautious as there were more events
lined up that could pose a risk for the single currency,
including the German presidential election on Wednesday.
[ID:nLDE65R0BY]
 ""We don't expect any surprises, but if it goes into a
second or third round, it would raise questions about German
Chancellor Angela Merkel's political support and weigh on the
euro,"" said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank
in Frankfurt.
 Some euro uncertainty was removed after a draft mandate for
bank supervisors indicated European Union bank stress tests
should be widened and conducted so that they address market
concerns about the exposure of financial institutions to
sovereign risk. [ID:nLDE65T0YZ]
 The Swiss franc fell against the euro after Hungary said it
was eyeing a new precautionary standby agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for 2011.[ID:nBUD005390]
 The move alleviated some concerns about Hungary's large
stock of franc-denominated debt.
 The euro was last up 0.5 percent at 1.3247 francs 
after hitting a lifetime low of 1.3165 on electronic trading
platform EBS and 1.3164 on Reuters on Tuesday. It is down more
than 10 percent on the franc this year.

 By Radu Marinas and Luiza Ilie
 BUCHAREST, June 30 (Reuters) - Romania's central bank held
interest rates at 6.25 percent on Wednesday, halting its easing
cycle after a government plan to raise value added tax added to
uncertainty about the economy.
 Concerns are mounting about the speed of recovery in
emerging Europe and governments like Romania's are struggling to
convince investors they can keep fiscal consolidation plans on
track and prevent a debt crisis in the euro zone from spreading.
Borrowing costs are at a record low following 400 basis
points worth of easing since the start of last year. Most
analysts had expected a further cut of 25 basis points before
the VAT hike was announced last weekend but changed their minds
as a result.

 Romania's leu  has hit all-time lows against the
euro this week after the government decided to hike VAT to plug
a funding gap and ensure resumption of a 20 billion euro,

 The central bank said higher VAT would immediately trigger a
significant rise in consumer prices and it would act to limit
the second-round effects of the measure and firmly anchor
inflation expectations at low levels. [ID:nBUC003730]
 ""The risk related to the above-mentioned effects, together
with persistent uncertainties surrounding the results of fiscal
consolidation efforts as well as of those regarding the
developments in the world economy, requires a continued prudent
monetary policy stance,"" it said in a statement.
The leu was almost unchanged after the interest rate
decision and later statement and was trading 0.5 percent higher
on the day at 4.366 per euro by 1300 GMT, pulling away from lows
hit during the previous session.
 ""The decision is what was supposed to happen given political
instability and the risks to the inflation outlook,"" said
Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc, chief economist at ING Bank in
Bucharest.
 ""Looking forward, I believe the central bank will wait to
see to what extent the VAT hike reflects in prices and based on
that we might see either rates on hold at the current level or
even hikes.""
 
 IMF RELIEF
 A cut in public wages, coupled with higher VAT, will help
keep Romania's budget deficit under control and will probably
ensure the IMF agrees to release the next tranche of economic
aid when it meets on Friday, reassuring jittery markets.
 But the austerity measures have worried investors as the VAT
hike by five percentage points to 24 percent increases inflation
risks and, coupled with a 25 percent cut in public sector wages,
will likely dampen consumption and economic growth.
 ""This decision shows a careful positioning of the central
bank given major uncertainties on the fiscal side related to the
impact of recent moves including the value-added tax increase,""
said Ionut Dumitru, chief economist with Raiffeisen Bank in
Bucharest.
 ""Our expectation is that inflation can now be heading
towards 8-8.5 percent at the end of the year, also due to hikes
in (household) heating prices and leu depreciation."" 
 Inflation was running at 4.4 percent in May.
 Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu said on Tuesday he
expected the economy to contract more this year than previously
forecast, predicting a drop of between 1 and 2 percent in gross
domestic product.

 OTTAWA, June 30 (Reuters) - Canada's economy unexpectedly
stalled in April on a slide in retail sales, suggesting the
pace of growth will slow in the second quarter after the
fastest growth in a decade in the first quarter.
 Statistics Canada on Wednesday said real gross domestic
product stayed flat in the month after seven straight months of
expansion, disappointing market expectations of 0.2 percent
growth.
 Consumers bought fewer new cars and clothing in April,
sending sales in the retail sector down by 1.7 percent, eroding
most of the 1.9 percent growth the previous month.
 Smaller declines in manufacturing and utilities were offset
by gains in mining, wholesale trade and non-residential
constructions, Statscan said.
 Canada's economy began to emerge from a mild recession late
last year, growing at an annualized rate of 4.9 percent in the
fourth quarter and 6.1 percent in the first quarter of this
year. The Bank of Canada projects second-quarter growth of 3.8
percent and sees the rate continuing to moderate over the
course of the year.

 (recasts, adds colour, detail)
 BUCHAREST, June 30 (Reuters) - Floods and torrential rain in
Romania have killed 24 people, forced 7,000 to be evacuated from
homes and damaged farmlands and infrastructure in the European
Union's second poorest country, officials said on Wednesday.
 Television footage from the worst-affected north of the
country showed deluged fields and damaged roads, houses still
metres deep in water from swollen rivers and barefoot children
scrabbling to rescue stranded animals. Dozens of villages were
reported to be without power after pylons were knocked down.
 Interior Minister Vasile Blaga told parliament thousands of
riot police continued to enforce flood defences and aid the
evacuation effort but he warned the damage would take a heavy
toll on the economy, struggling to emerge from a deep recession.
 ""Overall losses will be bigger than 0.6 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) which is too much,"" Blaga said.
 Romania had already started the process to request funds
from the EU's executive emergency fund, he said.
 More than 12,000 hectares of arable land in northeastern
Romania have been affected.
 The weather was not expected to improve until Thursday in
eastern Romania, according to the national forecaster.
 ""In the next 7 to 10 days, we are expecting the Danube
levels to be over the records reached in 2006,"" said Anamaria
Tanase, spokeswoman for the Apele Romane waters authority.
 The agriculture ministry has yet to assess the damage to
cereal crops and has so far kept its previous estimate of 6.7
million tonnes of wheat for 2010 from 2 million hectares.
 Romania's economy contracted more than 7 percent last year
and spending cuts and tax increases could further crimp growth. 
 Bucharest now predicts a drop of between 1 and 2 percent in
in GDP this year. The original estimate for this year's GDP, in
nominal terms, was 538 billion lei or around 126 billion euros.
 In 2006, the Danube poured over dams and burst defences
throughout central and southeastern Europe as melting snow and
heavy rain raised water levels to century highs.
 Extensive floods and cold snaps in 2006 damaged cereals
crops on around 300,000 hectares.

 * Equity exposure cut in favour of bonds, cash
 * Investors remain overweight equities, buy HY bonds
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Investors are entering the
second half of 2010 in a highly cautious mood, taking equity
exposure to its lowest level in well over a year and a half,
Reuters polls showed on Wednesday.
 Bond and cash holdings, meanwhile, rose very slightly in
June from the previous month.
 Surveys of 48 leading investment houses in the United
States, continental Europe, Britain and Japan showed average
equity holdings in a mixed asset fund falling to 51.8 percent in
June from 52.3 percent in May.
 A fifth poll of Chinese mutual funds, not included in the
global aggregate, showed the same pattern.
 Bond exposure among the global 48 rose to 35.1 percent from
34.9 percent and cash was lifted to 5.2 percent from 5.1
percent.
 Although both the latter moves would appear to imply a
search for safety, the increased exposure to bonds came mainly
from a shift into riskier high-yield debt.
 Participants in the poll indicated that they were being
buffeted by a mix of concern that the global economy is slowing,
that it may be hurt by government austerity moves and by the
continuing worries over euro zone sovereign debt.
 ""We're quite cautious because we expect the global economy
and profit growth to slow. We expect volatility coming from the
European sovereign debt crisis and monetary policy,"" said Joost
van Leenders, investment specialist at BNP Paribas Asset
Management.
 But the data -- including the moves into high-yield bonds --
also suggested that investors have not caved in to fears of a
double-dip recession.
 In aggregate, they retained a modest overweight in equities
and an underweight in both bonds and cash, positions that do not
spell retrenchment.
 ""We regard the recent weakness in equity markets as a
correction rather than the beginnings of a more lengthy downward
move, and believe that equity markets are likely to resume their
recovery,"" said Alec Letchfield, chief investment officer at
HSBC Global Asset Management.

 REGIONALLY
 U.S. fund managers trimmed their high exposure to equities
slightly in June and raised their bond allocations.
 The 12 U.S.-based fund management firms held an average of
64.8 percent of assets in equities, compared with 65.2 percent a
month earlier.
 The poll showed managers increasing bond holdings to an
average of 29.5 percent in June, from 28.8 percent in May. Cash
allocations rose to 2.2 percent from 2.0 percent.
 Changes in the U.S. poll sample mean that the moves are not
wholly comparable.
 Continental European investors cut bond allocations to the
lowest in four months in June and trimmed cash.
 The poll of 13 Europe-based asset management companies
showed a typical mixed portfolio holding 47.9 percent of its
assets in equities this month, unchanged from May.
 Japanese fund managers raised their weighting for bonds to a
one-year high in June.
 Stock weightings were little changed from the previous month.
 The average bond weighting rose to 49.2 percent from 48.4
percent in May, according to the poll of 12 fund managers. The
weighting for equities ticked up to 45.1 percent from 45.0
percent.
 British fund managers sought the safety of cash at the
expense of stocks in June.
 The survey of 11 fund managers showed allocations to cash
jumped to 8.7 percent in June, from 7.1 percent a month earlier
in the average global balanced portfolio.
 Allocations to shares fell for the fourth month running to
49.2 percent.
 A fifth poll taken in China but not included in the global
aggregates showed Chinese mutual funds cutting their weightings
of equities to 74.4 percent from 78.3 percent a month earlier.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2010 07:44AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-The WTO legal process in the Airbus dispute," June 30 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization is due to
publish a report on Wednesday around 1430GMT in the case brought
by the United States over EU subsidies for EADS 
subsidiary Airbus.
 But the ruling will not mark the end of the case, launched
by the United States in October 2004, and the prospect of trade
sanctions -- if ever approved -- is still far off.
 There are many opportunities for appeals and other legal
manoeuvres before the dispute is finally settled.
 The next major deadline could come on around July 16, when
the WTO is expected to issue a confidential interim ruling in
the counter-suit brought by the EU against the United States
over subsidies for Boeing .
 At that point, when the legal outcome in both cases is
emerging, the two sides may decide to end the litigation, and
negotiate a settlement.
 Otherwise, this is how the WTO legal system works.
 
 CONSULTATIONS
 A country launches a trade dispute by seeking formal
consultations with another country over the issue.
 These consultations last 60 days -- longer if the two
parties wish -- after which the plaintiff can request the
creation of a panel of judges -- legal and trade experts -- to
rule on the dispute.
 In this case, the consultations lasted 8 months.
 PANEL
 The panel is requested at a meeting of the WTO's dispute
settlement body (DSB), held once a month.
 The respondent can reject the first request, but it goes
through automatically on the second request unless all 153 WTO
members including the plaintiff agree to block it.
 In this case the United States requested a panel in May
2005, the EU rejected it at a DSB meeting in June, and it was
finally set up in July 2005.
 The panel should be formed within 20 days, with both parties
agreeing on all 3 judges sitting on it. If they cannot agree
they can ask the WTO director-general to compose the panel,
within another 10 days.
 The United States asked the director-general to do that in
October 2005, and the panel was formed later that month.
 
 THE RULING
 WTO panels usually aim to issue a ruling, or report, to the
parties within 6 months of being formed. But they can take
longer in a complex case.
 They aim to issue a confidential, interim report to the
parties to the dispute after 3-5 months, followed by a final,
confidential report a few months later. The final report rarely
differs substantively from the interim.
 This report is then translated into the other official WTO
languages, and circulated to all members and published on the
WTO website some 2-3 months later.
 In this case the panel advised the WTO in April 2006 that it
could not complete its work within 6 months. The ruling has been
delayed repeatedly since then. The interim report was issued in
September 2009, and the final report in March 2010.
 
 THE APPEAL
 Once the final ruling has been published, it will be adopted
by the WTO within 60 days, at the next meeting of the DSB. If
necessary, the complainant will call a special meeting of the
DSB to adopt the report.
 However, within that 60 days, either party can appeal.
 The appeal -- looking at whether the original panel observed
trade law in coming to its decision, rather than re-examining
the facts of the case -- is heard by three members drawn from
the WTO's seven-member Appellate Body of trade law experts.
 They must deliver their ruling, upholding or overturning all
or part of the original panel's findings,- within 90 days.
 WTO members must adopt or reject the appeal ruling within 30
days, at a meeting of the DSB. It can only be rejected by
consensus; that is with no member objecting to the rejection.
 There is an accelerated timetable for disputes involving
prohibited subsidies, as this one apparently does.
 Any recommendations in the report only take effect once it
has been adopted.
 COMPLIANCE
 If the panel or appellate body have found against the
respondent, they generally recommend that it should bring its
trade practice in line with WTO rules.
 Once the WTO has adopted the original panel or appeal ruling
at the DSB, the respondent has a ""reasonable period of time"" to
make these changes and conform with the rules.
 Both parties may agree the reasonable period of time within
45 days of adoption, or put it to arbitration, which takes up to
90 days. The period is usually 15 months from adoption.

 COMPLIANCE DISPUTES
 If the respondent believes the plaintiff has failed to
comply with the ruling in the reasonable period of time, it can
launch another dispute to determine compliance.
 This involves the same process of consultations, panel and
appeal. But it works to a tighter time-frame, with the panel
usually delivering a ruling within 90 days.
 SANCTIONS
 An appeal to a compliance dispute is the end of the line.
Now the plaintiff can seek retaliation to compensate it for the
losses it has suffered by the respondent's illegal behaviour,
until the respondent implements the ruling.
 This could involve a retaliatory increase in tariffs in the
product concerned or similar goods, or ""cross-retaliation"" in
another area, for instance lifting copyright or protection of
intellectual property rights for goods like software or music.
 The two sides may agree on compensation, or they may go to
arbitration over the size and scope of retaliation. The
arbitrator should deliver a decision within 60 days.

 * Banks borrow 131.9 bln euros from ECB, less than expected
 * Swiss franc falls as Hungary plans new IMF deal
 (Updates prices, adds comment)
 By Dominic Lau and Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro gained broadly on
Wednesday after banks borrowed less-than-expected funds from the
European Central Bank, easing concerns over European banks'
funding issues.
 The ECB lent banks 131.9 billion euros ($161.4 billion) in
three-month funds, as banks face the repayment of close to half
a trillion euros in 12-month funds on Thursday.
 The tender results were keenly awaited to gauge how reliant
European banks are on ECB emergency funding. Spanish, Portuguese
and Greek banks have been the biggest users of the facilities.
 ""The market, with respect to this particular tender, has
sort of got its 'knickers in a twist' over nothing. Any kind of
sense that the ECB is in some way going to leave the market
short of liquidity is obviously very far wide of the mark,"" said
Steve Barrow, currency strategist at Standard Bank.
 ""It just helps stabilise the euro ... For the moment, it's
not the slippery slope again. We might see some more stability,
may be even a little bit higher, $1.25 or above,"" he said.
 The euro extended gains to hit the day's high of $1.2304,
according to Reuters data, and rebounding from a two-week low
near $1.2150 struck the previous day.
 The single currency also rose more than 1 percent against
sterling. Flows related to the end of the month, quarter and
half year affected price movements in thin trade, traders said.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 1 percent at 108.99 yen
, after hitting an 8-1/2 year low of 107.30 the previous day.
 However, the euro is still down 14 percent against the U.S.
currency, down 18 percent against the yen and down 10 percent
versus the Swiss franc this year.
The dollar slipped 0.4 percent against a basket of major
currencies. The index has still advanced more than 10 percent so
far this year.
 UBS said it expected to see a ""significant amount"" of dollar
buying at the fix later in the day for the end of the quarter
and the first half of 2010, after looking at recent equities
performance throughout G10 currencies.
 
 RISK STAYS HIGH
 Market players were cautious as there were more events lined
up that could pose a risk for the single currency, including the
German presidential election on Wednesday.
 ""We don't expect any surprises, but if it goes into a second
or third round, it would raise questions about German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's political support and weigh on the euro,"" said
Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 They were also wary ahead of a meeting later on Wednesday
with Germany's central bank and financial market watchdog and
the country's largest banks to discuss stress test results.
 Illustrating the nervousness in the market, the VDAX-NEW
volatility index, Europe's main barometer of investor anxiety,
shed 2.4 percent on Wednesday after rising 15 percent in the
previous session to a three-week high.
 The Swiss franc fell against the euro after Hungary said it
was eyeing a new precautionary standby agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for 2011.
 The move alleviated some concerns about Hungary's large
stock of franc-denominated debt.
 The euro was last up 0.7 percent at 1.3275 francs after
hitting a lifetime low of 1.3165 on Tuesday. It is down more
than 10 percent on the franc this year.
 Traders will also keep an eye on U.S. ADP employment report
ahead of nonfarm payrolls data on Friday. A higher-than-expected
reading may give the dollar a lift after a slew of poor economic
data recently.

 * Launches 'Mark of Origin' to boost marketing
 * Cold weather has slowed tea production
 
 By Jeremy Clarke
 NAIROBI, June 30 (Reuters) - Kenya's tea sector will seek
new international markets for their product because of the
threat posed to growers and the economy by over-concentration
with traditional buyers, an industry official said on Wednesday.
 Tea is the second biggest source of foreign exchange in
Kenya after horticulture and ahead of tourism.
 ""Over-concentration in five traditional markets continues to
pose a risk with over 75 percent of all tea exports being sold
to Egypt, Pakistan, UK, Sudan and Afghanistan,"" said Titus
Kipyab, chairman of regulator Tea Board of Kenya.
 ""Emerging markets such as China, CIS (Commonwealth of
Independent States) and Middle East, North America and Africa
have been identified as having great potential,"" Kipyab said.
 Kipyab was speaking in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, at the
launch of a branding campaign. A 'Mark of Origin' will brand its
tea and increase its visibility internationally.
 ""The 'Mark of Origin' is intended to address some key market
concerns, specifically enhanced visibility and assurance of the
quality of Kenya tea to consumers,"" Kipyab said.
 He said the industry was facing a series of constraints.
 ""At the production level, the ever rising costs of
production, driven by increasing fuel, energy and wage bills
continue to be of concern,"" he said.
 Romano Kiome, the Agriculture Ministry's permanent
secretary, told the launch that Kenya's economy was at risk if
it continued to rely on so few markets for its tea exports.
 ""It presents risks as any bilateral disagreement or
socio-economic instability in these markets will have a direct
impact on the exports,"" said Kiome, who added that key emerging
markets, such as those in Africa, must now be targeted.
 The government said last week that tea production was
expected to rise by between 5 and 10 percent above 2009 levels
of 315 million kg, rather than the 15 percent previously
anticipated, due to cold weather.
 The cold season that normally runs from June to August
inhibits development of tea leaves, cutting output.

 * Confident can bring down inflation if economy growing well
 * If UK faces deflationary shock, will do more QE
 
 (Adds quotes, context)
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Bank of England policymaker Adam
Posen said on Wednesday he does not agree with the view held by
Governor Mervyn King that Britain's high inflation is almost
wholly caused by temporary factors.
 Inflation has been significantly above the central bank's 2
percent target since December, hitting a 17-month high of 3.7
percent in April, although it eased slightly in May.
 King attributes the pick-up in price pressures to changes in
value-added tax, volatile oil prices and the past depreciation
of sterling and says the effect will fade as slack in the
economy will bear down on prices.
 ""The only place where I would point to or acknowledge a
direct difference with the Governor is this issue of how much,
looking backwards, you want to say that this was just a series
of one-time shocks, where I think he has been pretty clear up to
now saying that has been the case,"" Posen said at an economic
conference in London.
 ""That is why we have nine members on the committee. And at
some point the committee makes a decision,"" he told the Society
of Business Economists.
 In a speech earlier, Posen had said that above-target
inflation had probably been due to a modest ""unanchoring"" of
inflation expectations, but that this was not sufficient grounds
to tighten policy when there were strong downward risks from
fiscal austerity, especially in the euro zone.
 If demand from the United States and emerging economies was
enough to outweigh euro zone weakness, and inflation
expectations remained above target, Posen was sure the BoE could
rapidly tackle the latter problem.
 ""If we end up overshooting inflation because we end up
happily in the good (growth) outcome, then I am very confident
we can bring it back down. We know how to do that.""
 Household inflation expectations had only risen so far on
short-term measures, and not on a five-year horizon, while
financial market measures of inflation expectations did not yet
show a strong rise, he added.
 The budgetary tightening announced by Britain's coalition
government in its June emergency budget was roughly on the scale
expected, but it was too early to draw exact conclusions about
its impact, Posen added.
 Posen also said the central bank could restart its
quantitative easing programme to purchase assets if the UK faced
a deflationary shock, though he could offer no guarantee that it
would prove fully effective.
 ""Go to the Governor's Mansion House speech, go to David
Miles's speech earlier this year. Both of them express a strong
conviction, with strong theoretical arguments, as to why you
could continually expand QE without limit,"" he said.
 ""Speaking personally for myself alone ... I'm a little bit
more humble about the capabilities of that policy. But that is
moot. If that is what we have available, and the shock is
deflationary, then that is what we use.""

 * Low inflation may give money policy room to manoeuvre
 
(Adds with economists' comments)
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, June 30 (Reuters) - Inflation in the 16-country
euro zone was lower than expected in June, a first estimate
showed on Wednesday, indicating that price growth remained
subdued despite an improving economy.
 The European Union statistics office said inflation in the
currency area was 1.4 percent year-on-year, down from 1.6
percent in May and below the 1.5 percent forecast by economists
in a Reuters poll.
 ""There is no inflationary threat on the horizon,"" said
Clemente De Lucia, economist at BNP Paribas.
 ""Declining core inflation will limit the upward pressures on
headline inflation coming from the most volatile components of
the HICP such as energy and food prices,"" he said.
 The European Central Bank wants to keep inflation just below
2 percent over the medium term.
 ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny was quoted as
saying on Tuesday that low euro-zone inflation gave monetary
policy room for manoeuvre to help stabilise markets and lend
support to the real economy.
 ""The retreat in euro zone consumer price inflation in June
reinforces belief that any interest rate hike by the ECB is a
long way off,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global
Insight.
 Economists said underlying inflationary pressures remained
weak and the upward impact from energy prices was waning.
 At the same time the euro zone's intensified fiscal
tightening plans and concerns over the banking sector were
limiting the single currency area's growth prospects. 
 ""Consequently, we expect the ECB to keep interest rates down
at the current level of 1.00 percent not only through 2010 but
deep into 2011. We currently see interest rates only rising to
1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011,"" said Archer.
 No detailed breakdown or monthly data was available with
Eurostat's so-called flash estimate, but the June figure is
likely to have been dampened by slower-than-expected price
growth in the euro zone's biggest economy, Germany.

 * To help rebuild credibility of statistics service
(Greek finance ministry corrects previous title of IMF official)
 ATHENS, June 30 (Reuters) - Greece on Wednesday appointed an
IMF official as the new chief of its statistics agency in a bid
to restore credibility shattered by drastic underestimates of
the nation's widening budget deficit.
 Andreas Georgiou, until now a deputy division chief in the
statistics department of the IMF, was appointed Chairman of
Greece's overhauled Hellenic Statistics Authority (ELSTAT), the
finance ministry said in an e-mail.
 A Greek national, Georgiou studied in Amherst College and
got his Ph.D. from Michigan University, the statement said.
 Greece unveiled legislation in February to make its
discredited statistics service fully independent after the EU
demanded it put an end to the release of flawed economic data.
 Greece is imposing drastic austerity cuts to avert
bankruptcy in return for a 110 billion euro ($134.6 billion)
bailout from the European Union and the IMF.
 Earlier this month, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou
said that Athens would ""build it again from the bottom up into
an organisation that produces reliable, timely data that reflect
the real value of the economy.""
 Frequent revisions of national account data since the
country joined the euro zone in 2001 have infuriated its
European Union partners, who demanded an overhaul of the
service.
 Greece's revelation in October last year that the 2009
deficit would be twice as big as previous estimates -- and four
times the EU ceiling -- prompted Eurogroup Chairman Jean Claude
Juncker to say ""the game is over -- we need serious statistics.""

 * Europeans could regain market share as a result
 * European players lower prices, Asians hike them - analysts
 
 By Christoph Steitz and Leonora Walet
 FRANKFURT/HONG KONG, June 30 (Reuters) - European solar
players could get an unexpected business boost as a stronger
yuan and a weaker euro relative to the dollar deal a double blow
to low-cost Asian rivals' foreign expansion strategy.
 Chinese solar cell and module players such as Suntech Power
Holding and Yingli Green Energy built up a 50-percent market
share in the German market, the world's biggest, thanks to
weakness in the dollar over the past three years and the fixed
yuan exchange rate.
 This allowed China's players to offer modules at discounts
of up to 20 percent versus European peers, which charge premiums
based on their claim of higher quality products.
 But conditions are turning around.
 The euro has fallen about 15 percent against the dollar
since the start of the year, while China this month relaxed
control over its currency, dampening the outlook for Chinese
solar players and possibly signalling a halt on discounts.
 The yuan hit 6.785 per dollar on Wednesday, its highest
since a landmark revaluation in 2005, and 11 days after its
dollar peg was shed.
 The bigger Chinese players book 50 percent of their revenues
in euro, and an appreciation in the yuan also makes it harder
for them to export products to the United States and Europe.
 ""Asian operators are losing a bit of their competitive edge
due to markedly weaker euro exchange rates,"" WestLB analysts
wrote in a note to clients.
 ""Most Asian operators are, for F/X reasons, unable to cut
prices by the middle of 2010, so European PV (photovoltaic)
manufacturers are under less pressure to reduce their prices.""
 Currency pressure, analysts say, has already forced Asian
players to hike prices -- in light of massive capacity
increases, pricing could be a decisive factor.

 ""Several contacts have confirmed to us that contracts signed
on the basis of 1.30-1.40 euros/watt have been renegotiated up,
with some price points reaching 1.6 euros/watt. An unknown
Chinese manufacturer offered to sell us cells for $1.4/watt
(1.16 euros/watt) - more expensive than at Q-Cells (1.1
euros/watt) and modules for $1.8/W (1.5 euros/watt),"" Societe
Generale analysts wrote.
 The chief executive of German module and cell maker Sunways
confirmed that some Chinese players had raised prices, but
declined to name individual players.
 In fact, European companies seeking to take back market
share could even afford to lower their prices, analysts said.
 HSBC analyst Christian Rath said that European groups would
be able to cut prices by up to 6 percent.
 ""Currency swings will give the European players some room to
breathe,"" said Martina Ecker, managing director at Jefferies.
 Beneficiaries of the Chinese companies' problems include
German producers Q-Cells, SolarWorld and Wacker Chemie.
 
 ROOM TO BREATHE
 The key question for solar markets is how prolonged the
weakness of the euro will be and, above all, how much the yuan
will appreciate.
 Morgan Stanley expects the yuan to appreciate by 10 percent
over the next 18 months, which would significantly narrow the
cost advantage Chinese players enjoy over European peers.
 A Collins Stewart report puts this advantage at $0.30-$0.60
per watt.
 A 10 percent strengthening of the yuan would increase costs
of Chinese manufacturers by $0.10 per watt, eroding that cost
advantage by a third.
 Within China, solar leaders Yingli and Suntech would be
hardest hit by currency changes.
 Analysts noted that Suntech, with a large exposure to
European markets, could face continued foreign exchange losses
from the euro's depreciation and rising manufacturing costs due
to the yuan's appreciation.
 The same goes for Yingli.
 ""Only 50 percent of Yingli's sales and balance sheet items
are denominated in euros, but since it lacks a comprehensive
hedging program the company suffered among the highest FX
charges in the industry in Q1 at $0.16 per share,"" Battle Road
Research analysts wrote, with a ""hold"" rating on Yingli.
 While currency factors could diminish their cost
competitiveness, Chinese firms such as Trina Solar and JA Solar
may escape the currency problem with just a few scratches.
 ""It is critical to focus on cost-competitiveness,"" said
Morgan Stanley analyst Sunil Gupta, adding that the companies'
low debt should let them grow the business despite tight market
conditions.
 The stocks are still relatively cheap. Suntech and Yingli
trade at a respective 15.9 and 13.2 times estimated 12-month
forward earnings, StarMine data shows, a discount to Germany's
SolarWorld and Roth & Rau that trade at 18.5 and 17.1 times,
respectively.
 ""The question remains how the Asian players are hedged. Q2
results should shed light on this. Overall, however, Europeans
could increase their market share again as a result,"" HSBC's
Rath said.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro extended gains on
Wednesday as banks sought less funds than expected from the
European Central Bank, easing concerns the central bank was
pulling support too quickly from the money market.
 The ECB lent banks 131.9 billion euros ($161.4 billion) in
three-month funds on Wednesday, below expectations, as banks
face the repayment of close to half a trillion euros in 12-month
funds on Thursday.
 ""The amount taken down today was smaller so if you link it
to confidence, it shows that weaker banks don't need as much
money as expected,"" said Marcus Hettinger, global currency
strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
 The euro initially rose around 50 ticks against the dollar
before extending gains to hit the day's high of $1.2284,
according to Reuters data, and moving further away from a
two-week low near $1.2150 struck the previous day.
 Traders cited some Asian central bank demand below $1.2200.
 More offers were absorbed around $1.2270/80, with
stop-losses near $1.2340/50.
 The euro also gained 1.0 percent against sterling. Flows
related to the end of the month, quarter and half year affected
price movements in thin trade, traders said.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.9 percent at 108.86,
after hitting a 8-1/2 year low of 107.30 yen the previous day.
 
 EVENT RISK
 But market players were cautious as there were more events
lined up that could pose a risk for the single currency.
 Investors were keeping an eye on the German presidential
election on Wednesday.
 ""We don't expect any surprises, but if it goes into a second
or third round, it would raise questions about German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's political support and weigh on the euro,"" said
Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 They were also wary ahead of a meeting later on Wednesday
with Germany's central bank and financial market watchdog and
the country's largest banks to discuss stress test results.
 The Swiss franc fell against the euro after Hungary said it
was eyeing a new precautionary standby agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for 2011.
 The move alleviated some concerns about Hungary's large
stock of franc-denominated debt.
 The euro was last up 0.5 percent at 1.3260 franc after
hitting a lifetime low of 1.3165 on Tuesday. It is down nearly
11 percent on the franc this year.
 The dollar was steady at 88.67 yen, having lost nearly 1
percent on Tuesday as the rush to safety pushed U.S. two-year
Treasury yields to record lows.
 Support is seen at around 88.00 yen, the low struck on May
6, with one dealer citing talk of options in the 87.95-88.15 yen
region due to expire later on Wednesday.
 Traders will also keep an eye on U.S. ADP employment report
ahead of nonfarm payrolls data on Friday. A higher-than-expected
reading may give the dollar a lift after a slew of poor economic
data recently.
 The Australian dollar gained 0.9 percent on the dollar at
$0.8543 after falling more than 2.5 percent in the previous

 By Krisztina Than
 BUDAPEST, June 30 (Reuters) - Hungary plans to extend its
existing financing deal with the IMF and EU by two months until
the end of 2010 and sign a new, precautionary standby agreement
with the IMF for 2011, an aide to the prime minister said on
Wednesday.
 Gyorgy Szapary told business news website www.fn.hu that
while the Hungarian government was not planning to draw upon the
new loan, a precautionary deal could boost markets' confidence
in the country.
 For the time being Hungary was not planning to draw on more
funds from its existing 2008 IMF/EU loan, he added.
 ""There are plans -- but no talks yet -- that we would sign a
precautionary loan agreement for 2011,"" Szapary said.
 ""This means that the government does not intend to draw on
the money, as the Hungarian state is solvent, but such a
precautionary deal could strengthen markets' confidence which
could be reflected in lower risk premia...,"" he added.
 ""We would draw upon the money only if something happened in
international markets which would make it difficult for the
Hungarian state to have access to loans there.""
 Hungary will hold negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund and the EU in July to review its existing
programme secured in 2008.
 News of the planned new IMF deal helped the forint firm
versus the euro and the Swiss franc.
 ""It's probably positive for the markets as it provides a
solid anchor for fiscal prudence and reduces risks to financial
stability,"" said Anders Svendsen at Nordea.
 Hungary has drawn more than 14 billion euros from the $25.1
billion IMF/EU credit facility secured in 2008, but has not
drawn on fresh funds this year after successfully returning to
market financing in 2009 after the previous Socialist government
stabilised finances.
 NeigHbouring Romania, which has a similar financing deal
with the IMF, is expected to get the next tranche of its IMF aid
early in July, after the government there pushed through a value
added tax hike and public sector wage cuts.
 
 RISKS REMAIN
 ""A loan extension for Hungary is a welcome sign as the
supranational cushion is extended providing a backstop to the
country and the currency,"" said Peter Attard Montalto at Nomura.
 ""However it is important to remember that the process of
negotiation will be messy, with (ruling party) Fidesz pushing
strongly for more room to manoeuvre whilst EU and IMF push back
equally strongly for conservative fiscal policy.""
 The new centre-right government, which won elections in
April, has pledged to meet this year's 3.8 percent of GDP budget
deficit target and earlier this month announced a quick set of
measures to achieve this. 
 But analysts have warned that implementation risks remain,
especially linked to a planned big new tax on the financial
sector.
 Hungary's public debt, at around 80 percent of GDP, is still
the highest in central Europe, and sharp gains in the Swiss
franc versus the forint this month highlighted the stability
risk linked to a large stock of foreign currency debt held by
households and firms.

 By Mike Dolan
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - World stocks steadied on
Wednesday after their biggest one-day plunge in over a year,
with European markets bouncing on the last day of the quarter
after European Central Bank funding operations eased nerves.
 Fresh banking and sovereign debt stress in Europe and fears
of an austerity-fuelled double-dip into recession for the world
economy have gripped investors again in the final days of June.
 MSCI's world equity index, which has lost more than 10
percent since April and is down more than 7 percent over the
first six months of 2010, held the line after losing more than
three percent on Tuesday.
 The global index, which was up 0.1 percent in Europe on
Wednesday, has recorded its worst quarter since the final three
months of 2008 when the demise of Lehman Brothers sent world
markets and the economy into a tailspin.
 Worries this week that an expiry of some 442 billion euros
of one-year emergency ECB loans would leave many strapped
European banks with severe financing difficulties eased a little
after a replacement 3-month operation saw less of scramble for
funds than feared.
 ""It's definitely a good sign and means there is still some
interbank lending occurring within the European money market,
and that's it's not just a vertical relationship between banks
and the ECB,"" said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche Bank.
 The ECB said 171 banks borrowed 131.9 billion euros ($161.4
billion) over three months at a flat rate of 1 percent, below
expectations for demand of 210 billion euros.
 ""The banks are in effect swapping a comfy sofa for a stool
-- but at least there are plenty of stools,"" said Societe
Generale rate strategist Suki Mann.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of European stocks was 0.3
percent higher on Wednesday, up from a three-week closing low in
the prior session. European banking stocks rebounded 1.5
percent. Safe-haven German government bond futures for September
delivery retreated 0.02 percent.
 ECB relief and slightly higher short-term interest rates due
to the week's net drain of emergency funds helped push the euro
sharply higher. It rallied almost one percent after two days of
steep losses, gaining more than one percent on sterling.
 ""Any kind of sense that the ECB is in some way going to
leave the market short of liquidity is obviously very far wide
of the mark,"" said Steve Barrow, strategist at Standard Bank.
 
 MOUNTING NERVES
 Looming publication of European bank stress tests next month
have added to the fresh nerves about the sector. The Bundesbank
said on Wednesday that German banks have agreed to participate
in EU-wide stress tests once detailed parameters are published.
 ""A confluence of events may well cause market anxiety to
culminate today, potentially causing risk aversion to mark at
least a local peak,"" said Commerzbank rate strategist Christoph
Rieger, adding that Bund option expiries, month-end portfolio
adjustments and U.S. employment data were also likely to weigh.
 U.S. June private-sector employment data from ADP is due out
later in the session and the benchmark non-farm payrolls report
is due on Friday. U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open on
Wall Street later.
 Alongside European banking and sovereign debt jitters and the
calendar stresses of the half-year mark, investors are
increasingly fearful for global economic growth after a series
of downbeat reports from the United States and China.
 ""Markets are very sensitive to any signs that growth is
failing. There have been question marks over the big components
of global growth such as U.S. consumer demand and Chinese demand
... (and) there isn't a lot of good news,"" said Bernard
McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.
 Risk reduction was fuelled by a report that showed a slump
in U.S. consumer confidence. 
 Chinese stocks fell 1.2 percent, extending a 4 percent slide
on Tuesday to a new 14-month low. Emerging stocks dropped
another 0.5 percent on Wednesday after almost three percent
losses on Tuesday. 
 Earlier, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
dropped another 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei average fell 2
percent to a seven-month low after breaking below a support
level.

 The European Union statistics office said inflation in the

 ATHENS, June 30 (Reuters) - Greece's National Bank, the

to buy a 5 to 7 percent stake.
 ""Press reports that NBG is seeking a strategic investor are

capital, including in particular through a share capital
increase on a non pre-emptive basis in favour of a new

told Reuters that NBG was not in talks to sell a stake.
 Last week, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou urged the
country's lenders to take ""strategic regrouping steps"" to better
cope with the debt crisis and resume funding its ailing economy.
 Debt-laden Greece is trying to woo foreign investors and
sell some state assets to help plug a huge budget gap and comply
with terms of a 110 billion euro ($134.6 billion) bailout from

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro rebounded on Wednesday
after two days of steep losses, but investors remained worried
about the global recovery and concerned the European Central
Bank may be pulling back emergency funds too quickly.
 The Swiss franc pared gains against the euro after Hungary
said it was eyeing a new precautionary standby agreement with
the International Monetary Fund for 2011.
 The move alleviated some concerns about Hungary's large
stock of franc-denominated debt.
 Flows related to the end of the month, quarter and half year
may also exacerbate price movements in thin trade, traders said.
 By 0732 GMT, the euro edged up 0.3 percent to $1.2221, still
not far from a two-week low near $1.2150 struck the previous
day.
 Traders cited some Asian sovereign demand below $1.2200.
 Chartwise, it needed to hold above $1.2145-55 and then
$1.2110 to avoid a slide towards its four-year low at $1.1876.
 Focus is on a three-month tender by the European Central
Bank on Wednesday ahead of the expiry of a 12-month operation on
Thursday when euro zone banks must repay 442 billion euros.
 A large take-up at the three-month tender would indicate
many banks were still reliant on the central bank lifeline.
Spanish, Portuguese and Greek banks have been the largest users
of the ECB's lending facilities.
 Investors were also keeping an eye on the German
presidential election on Wednesday.
 ""We don't expect any surprises, but if it goes into a second
or third round, it would raise questions about German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's political support and weigh on the euro,"" said
Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank.
 That concern along with the ECB expiry are negative risks
for the euro, she said.
 The euro has support at $1.2145-55, a pivot area stemming
from intra-day lows and highs in May and June, and then at about
$1.2110, the 61.8 percent retracement of its move up from
$1.1876 to near $1.2500 in June.
 
 DOLLAR STEADY
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.4 percent to 108.31 yen,
after hitting an 8-1/2 year low of 107.30 yen on trading
platform EBS on Tuesday.
 Against the Swiss franc, it clawed 0.4 percent higher to
1.3240 francs after hitting a lifetime low of 1.3165 on Tuesday.
It is down nearly 11 percent on the franc this year.
 The dollar was steady at 88.63 yen, having lost nearly 1
percent on Tuesday as the rush to safety pushed U.S. two-year
Treasury yields to record lows.
 The market was generally short, with stop-losses seen around
89.50 yen.
 Support is seen at around 88.00 yen, the low struck on May
6, with one dealer citing talk of options in the 87.95-88.15 yen
region due to expire later on Wednesday.
 Traders will also keep an eye on U.S. ADP employment report

reading may give the dollar a lift after a slew of poor economic

 The dollar index was flat at 86.018, with resistance
expected in the 86.42 to 86.48 region. The latter is the 38.2
percent of the index's decline from a high of 88.71 to its
recent low of 85.09.
 The Australian dollar gained 0.8 percent on the dollar at

subsidies and must be stopped within 90 days.
 They said the document, the latest stage in a decades-long
transatlantic dispute over the multi-trillion-dollar market for
large passenger aircraft and expected to be issued some time
after 1400 GMT, would back many of the U.S. complaints.
 Airbus rival Boeing hopes the report on Airbus will stop the
EU from subsidising the new A350 plane, which will compete with
the U.S. company's 787 Dreamliner.
 Boeing and Airbus parent EADS are competing for a $50
billion contract to supply the U.S. Air Force with new tankers.
The EADS offering is based on the Airbus A330, one of the planes
that received aid challenged by the United States.
 The EU is likely to appeal against the ruling, delaying the
point at which it takes force. Brussels says the Airbus findings
are only part of the picture and it is premature for one side to
claim victory.
 The WTO is expected to produce an initial confidential
report in July in a countersuit brought by the EU against the
United States over support for Boeing.

 * Decision expected, next move likely a hike in late 2010-11
 * C.bank says inflation risks acceptable, economy improving
 * Does not mention the rouble

(Adds background, analyst quotes)
 By Yelena Fabrichnaya and Toni Vorobyova
 MOSCOW, June 30 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank halted its
13-month run of interest rate cuts on Wednesday and said policy
may stay on hold for months given a recovery that looks on surer
ground while price pressures remain benign.
 All but one of the analysts polled by Reuters this month had
forecast an end to the cycle of cuts -- stretching back to April
of last year -- which have taken benchmark rates to a record low
of 7.75 percent and helped the economy out of recession. 
 Russia is now expected to move towards tightening -- but not
until inflation picks up towards the end of 2010 or early 2011.
 ""The current parameters of interest rate policy...ensure an
acceptable balance between affordable loans and inflation
risks,"" the central bank said in a statement.
 ""The Bank of Russia thinks it likely that the current level
of interest rates will be retained in coming months.""
 The regulator indicated on May 31 that last month's easing
could be the last in the cycle [ID:nLDE64U1O7] -- a message that
officials reiterated on Tuesday [ID:nLDE65S0UQ].
 Although the slowdown in inflation seen at the start of the
year is now running out of steam, ""in coming months inflation
risks remain at an acceptable level"", the regulator said.
 ""That could be interpreted as several months, but not
several quarters. I expect that inflation will accelerate in
December-January, and the central bank will start to hike
rates,"" said Alexander Morozov, chief Russia economist at HSBC.
 Most analysts see rates stable for the rest of the year
before gradual tightening starts in 2011. [ECILT/RU]
 Consumer prices rose 6.0 percent year-on-year in May,
matching April's post-Soviet Union low [ID:nLDE6531IN]. That is
in line with the central bank's expectations for 2010 as a whole
and leaves the benchmark refinancing rate comfortably in
positive territory even when adjusted for inflation.
 
 COMFORTABLE ON ROUBLE
 The central bank did not directly mention the rouble ,
in contrast to earlier statements this year, when it pointed to
rouble appreciation as one of the reasons for continued rate
cuts. This time, it said the level of rates is ""neutral from the
point of view of cross-border capital flows"".
 ""If there is no pressure on the rouble from capital inflows,
towards appreciation, then it does not give a cause for cutting
rates,"" said Morozov at HSBC.
 For its part, the rouble showed little reaction to the
decision, holding broadly stable at 34.38 against the
euro-dollar basket  and supported by oil prices.
[ID:nLDE65T0AR]
 May brought signs of improved economic recovery with faster
growth in retail sales, capital investment and industrial output
[ID:nLDE65H10Y] [ID:nLDE64R1LC] [ID:nLDE65G1Q5] -- all noted by
the central bank in its statement.
 The regulator, which has sought to encourage more affordable
lending to businesses and consumers as Russia strives to build
an less dependent on oil, also welcomed continued signs of
credit growth. [ID:nLDE65N1QH]
 Banks, including Russia's biggest lender Sberbank
, have complained that rates are now too low and they
may be left with more bad debts after borrowers, tempted by
cheap credit, take on more than they can afford. [ID:nLDE6500UG]
 But the central bank said loans could become more affordable
yet thanks to current monetary policy and ""a revaluation of
credit risk as the economic situation improved and market
expectations stabilise.""
 The next board meeting on policy is due in July, the
regulator said. As usual, it did not give a date.
 June was the first time the bank had issued a statement
following an unchanged policy decision -- part of its move
towards greater openness under the auspices of a long term plan
to shift to inflation targeting as the focus of policy from
exchange rate control. Previously it only commented when rates
were changed.

 By Kim Yeon-hee and Yoo Choonsik
 SEOUL, June 30 (Reuters) - South Korea's industrial output
in May rose faster than expected from April on robust exports,
but a widely watched leading indicator suggested the recovery
in Asia's fourth-largest economy would moderate in the coming
months.
 Underscoring the uncertain outlook, South Korea's customs
agency warned exports to Europe could falter if the region's
sovereign debt crisis and fiscal austerity campaigns bite into
spending by consumers and companies. [ID:nSUL000097]
 ""Various economic data and the government's remarks today
show the economic growth momentum that has been fast until now
will start moderating, although growth will continue,"" said
Park Sang-hyun, economist at HI Investment & Securities.
 But Park said the uncertain economic prospects would not be
sufficient to stop the Bank of Korea from raising its policy
interest rate during the next quarter, as widely expected by
analysts based on the central bank's recent remarks.
 South Korean stocks <.KS11> and the currency  fell
while bonds gained as investors cut back their holdings of
riskier assets in favour of safe havens, fearing the global
economic recovery may be sputtering.
 Data on Wednesday showed South Korean industrial production
grew much faster than expected in May, retail sales reversed a
two-month decline and investment in production equipment posted
solid growth.
 However, an official indicator of future economic activity,
which can precede economic trends by more than 6 months,
pointed to a cooldown in the rate of economic expansion.
 The indicator rose from a year earlier in May, but slowed
for a fifth consecutive month to 8.0 percent from 8.6 percent
in April.
 Elsewhere in the region, a private survey in Japan found
growth in new export orders for Japanese companies slowed for a
second straight month. [ID:nTOE65T00J]
 Manufacturing indexes from China, the United States and the
euro zone are also expected to show on Thursday that factory
output growth in those economies is slowing slightly, according
to Reuters polls.
 CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON?
 Statistics Korea said earlier on Wednesday that the
industrial output index rose a seasonally adjusted 2.6 percent
last month from April, above market expectations for a 0.9
percent rise, while a capital investment index rose a
seasonally adjusted 3.9 percent.
 At the same time, an index measuring manufacturing
companies' business confidence for July jumped to a record
high, led by an improvement in exporters' outlook, central bank
data showed. [ID:nSUL000095]
 The finance ministry also said the economic recovery would
continue on the back of brisk exports and improving employment.
[ID:nTOE65T009]
 However, a survey by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and
Industry showed companies were planning to boost spending on
production equipment only modestly in the second half due to
uncertain economic prospects. [ID:nTOE65T039]
 South Korea's economy has pulled out of the fallout of the
2007-2008 global crisis ahead of most of its rivals and is
tipped to post the fastest growth next to Turkey this year
within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
 The finance ministry last week sharply lifted its economic
growth forecast for this year to what would be the highest in
eight years and said economic policy would gradually return to
pre-crisis settings. [ID:nTOE65N023]
 The Bank of Korea warned in May and June of growing
inflation pressures in line with a sustained recovery in Asia's
fourth-largest economy, prompting analysts to boost
expectations for an interest rate increase between July and
September.

 SOUTH MAQIAO VILLAGE, China, June 30 (Reuters) - Ma
Xiangqian's house stands silent in a tree-shrouded village in
central China, the inscription on its padlocked gate announcing
the hopes for prosperity his family says drove him into the
factory life that killed him.
 The shy 19-year-old was among the first of a string of
deaths this year at a vast Foxconn electronics complex of
400,000 workers in far southern China, that has cast a
spotlight on the hard lives of the country's 150 million
migrant labourers.
 Foxconn and police believe Ma, like nine other young
workers after him, killed himself. Ma's parents suspect he was
killed.
 The deaths have sparked an uproar about stressful
conditions in the strictly-run complex and raised concerns
about the damage to society from China's rush into
industrialisation that is luring millions to quit rural life.
 Foxconn says its treats its workers humanely and follows
labour laws and regulations. Ma Xiangqian's sister, Ma Liqun,
who also worked at the company's same big complex as him, said
many workers resented what they said were long hours, a
relentless pace on the production line, and harsh discipline.
 Ma's journey from his quiet village in Henan province to
the humming industrial site, where he died on Jan. 23,
illustrates how the high expectations of China's migrant
workers in search of better wages can darken life in their
rural homes.
 ""Loud and bright, this year will be better than the last,""
says the traditional Lunar New Year couplet glued to the locked
gate of Ma's now empty home. ""Living dragons and tigers, next
year will be better than this.""
 Ma took the job at Foxconnto help his family escape 60,000
yuan ($8,827) of debts from building the two-story house, meant
to help him find a bride, said his family.
 ""In the countryside, no matter how hard up you are, you
need to build a decent home so your son can get married,"" said
Ma's father, Ma Zishan, speaking by phone from Guangdong where
he and his wife continue to press police to look into their
son's death.
 ""You need a son to keep the family together and keep the
farmland, but now he's dead and I don't know where to turn.""
 Ma's parents were already saddled with fines for having
four children, double what family planning rules usually allow.
Like other villagers, they looked to their children to find
work and send remittances to help pay for new houses,
motorbikes and TVs.
 RISING ASPIRATIONS, RISING COST
 Rising rural aspirations, and the rising cost, are part of
the reason for the increasing discontent of China's migrant
workers, said Li Changping, a former rural official who won
fame in China in 2000 by denouncing the economic burdens on
farmers.
 ""These migrant worker kids carry expectations about
building a home, getting married, having children, becoming
successful, and there's a real pressure from trying to keep
up,"" said Li, who now lives in Beijing, researching rural
development.
 Making a direct link between any particular death and these
pressures was impossible, he said. ""But, still, migrant workers
certainly do feel the stress,"" he added.
 Like much of modern rural China, Ma's home village is
dominated by old people and children.
 ""Nearly all the young people go out to work,"" said Ma
Zibing, a grey-haired 62-year-old, sunning himself outside his
home. Most in this clan-based village of about 400 share the Ma
surname.
 ""Most head south to Guangdong, but they go all across the
country. All that's left here are old people and kids.""
 The villagers make thousands of yuan a year by growing
sapling, shrubs and flowers that are then sold to urban
markets.
 This relatively lucrative farming niche is not enough for
the the young. They prefer to join the army of rural migrants,
toiling on road works, building sites and production lines.
 With nearly 100 million residents, close to 70 percent of
them rural, Henan province is a vast source of migrants.
 ""You need to do it to make real money,"" said Ma Wenfang, a
21-year-old woman, who said she had come back to the village to
marry after working at a factory in south China.
 NOBODY FARMS
 She saw no future in farming.
 ""Nobody our age farms anymore,"" she said with an amused
snort. ""Nobody my age could plant a stalk.""
 The torrent of cheap workers, most with a basic education,
has helped make China a global base for manufacturing.
 It has also brought change to villages such as South
Maqiao. Two-story homes of brick and tile are displacing
one-story mud-brick dwellings. Motorbikes and electric scooters
outnumber bicycles. Farmers tending their plots of shrubs
interrupt conversations to answer cell phones.
 Ma's first name, Xiangqian, means to ""move forward"". As the
sole son among four children he carried the hopes of his
parents to find a foothold in this rising wealth. In rural
China, boys are often seen as bearing the family line.
 But achieving those hopes left a heavy financial burden on
the family. The parents defied family planning rules by having
four children -- Ma Xiangqian was the youngest, with three
sisters -- rather than the two usually allowed.
 They struggled with fines of 20,000 yuan ($2,928) imposed
by village officials, said Ma Xiangqian's mother, Gao Caoying.
 ""If you didn't pay you'd be locked up. But the village
chief too pity on us and let us pay a little bit at a time,""
she said.
 ATTRACTING SUITABLE BRIDE
 They borrowed 60,000 yuan from kin and friends to help pay
for the two-story house, which cost 80,000 yuan unfurnished, in
the hope it would help their son attract a suitable bride.
 ""Everyone builds homes for their children whether they have
the money or not. The big task in life is to have a good house
for your son and his wife,"" said Ma Jianfu, a fellow villager
and cousin of the family. ""But everyone depends on working
away. If you don't work away, you're living standard won't keep
up.""
 Ma Xiangqian quit junior secondary school to train as a
cook. Then he turned his hopes to joining his older sisters in
Guangdong, where they worked in factories.
 After a stint in a garment factory, in November last year
he joined his sister in the Foxconn complex, owned by Taiwan's
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which make products under
contract for Apple Inc, Dell and Hewlett-Packard among big
electronics brands.
 Other Foxconn workers who died in the recent rash of
suicides also came from struggling rural backgrounds, according
to profiles in Chinese newspapers and magazines.
 ""There'll come a day when I give you a big house to live in
so you can live a good life,"" Lu Xin, a 24-year-old who jumped
from a dormitory in May told his mother before his suicide,
Phoenix Weekly, a Chinese magazine, reported this month.
 Ma Xiangqian was bullied by supervisors who pushed him off
production work to cleaning toilets, said his parents. His
first full month's wages at Foxconn amounted to 1,943 yuan.
 Back in their home village, the saplings that once boosted
the family income were dead and yellow from neglect and
overgrown with weeds. Neighbours said they sympathised, but did
not have the time to look after the neglected plot.
 ""Nobody has the time to help,"" said Ma Shujian, an elderly
neighbour. ""We're all too busy looking after ourselves.""

 * Aussie, kiwi revive a bit but struggle after trampling
 * Swissie, yen hold gains made in safety flight
 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, June 30 (Reuters) - The euro and Australian dollar
edged up against the yen but stayed near recent lows on
Wednesday, after a heavy round of leveraged trade unwinding,
while the euro was also within range of a record low on the
safe-haven Swiss franc.
 While doubts about a global recovery were playing out,
traders said, the rush towards safe-haven currencies may prove to
be short lived once quarter-end hedging and repatriation flows
have dried up, although the euro remained vulnerable longer term.
 Some said real money investors had sold riskier currencies
and equities, while moves were exaggerated by thin trading
conditions and some of the selling may have been overdone.
 The euro got a bit of a lift from light short-covering from
Middle East investors and an Asian real money account, one dealer
said, but chartwise needed to hold above $1.2145-55 and then
$1.2110 to avoid a slide towards its four-year low at $1.1876.
 Focus is on a three-month tender by the European Central Bank
ahead of the expiry of a 12-month operation on Thursday when euro
zone banks must repay 442 billion euros ($539 billion) borrowed
at low rates as part of ECB efforts to boost liquidity.
 The market is waiting to see what the take-up at the
three-month operation will be and what that would signify for the
funding situation at European banks. Investors fear Thursday's
expiry could leave some banks facing a liquidity shortfall.
 ""The event risk is probably overdone. Yes there is a risk
that a huge number would worsen sentiment but it would have to be
a large number in the region of 350-400 billion euros to have a
lasting effect,"" said Robert Ryan, FX strategist at BNP Paribas
in Singapore.
 ""But at this stage everybody knows the banks are reliant on
the ECB.""
 Barclays said in a note it expected 250-300 billion euros of
the one-year funding to be rolled over into the three-month
operation.
 This would signal modest demand for short-term financing, and
would likely be positive for risky currencies after press reports
had suggested some banks were struggling to gain access to
short-term financing, which Barclays said meant consensus
forecasts about demand had probably risen.
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent to 108.15 yen but remained well
within sight of its 8-½ year low of 107.30 yen on trading
platform EBS struck on Tuesday.
 Against the Swiss franc, it clawed 0.2 percent higher to
1.3213 francs after hitting a lifetime low of 1.3165 on Tuesday.
It is down nearly 11 percent on the franc this year.
 The Australian dollar gained 0.4 percent to 75.32 yen after a
drop of nearly 4 percent on Tuesday and was 0.2 percent up on the
dollar at $0.8508 after falling more than 2.5 percent in the
previous session.
 Support for the Aussie is seen at $0.8465, a 50 percent
retracement of its rise from $0.8066 to $0.8860 in May and June.
 ""There's still very little liquidity in the markets. Hedge
funds are still licking their wounds after some very nasty moves
in May so all these turns in sentiment are being exaggerated by a
lack of liquidity,"" Ryan said.
 Dollar/yen was soft at 88.54 yen, having lost nearly 1
percent on Tuesday as the rush to safety pushed U.S. two-year
Treasury yields to record lows.
 Support is seen at around 88.00 yen, the low struck on May 6,
with one dealer citing talk of options in the 87.95-88.15 yen
region due to expire later on Wednesday.
 An official at a Japanese FX margin broker said there was
talk of bids in dollar/yen from real money investors near 88.00
yen and short-covering interest around that level but with
stop-loss sell orders then expected below that figure.
 The dollar also got some support from Japanese importers, a
trader said, with current levels possibly looking attractive to
Japanese investors, especially as Japanese authorities may start
trying to talk the yen lower if the dollar neared 85.00 yen.
 Others said the dollar could benefit from month-end buying
after a fall in Wall Street this month left many non-U.S.
investors needing dollars to rebalance their portfolios.
 ""It is worth emphasizing that the fall in global equities
this month biases today's month-end fix towards U.S. dollar
buying,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 ""The rationale is threefold -- non-U.S. investors hedge
global equity exposure more than U.S. investors do; a fall in
U.S. equities during the month leaves non-U.S. investors
overhedged on their S&P holdings; thus hedge rebalancing requires
dollar purchases at the fix.""
 The S&P-500 index has lost over 4 percent this month and was
looking increasingly bearish on the charts.
 The dollar index was flat at 86.018, with resistance expected
in the 86.42 to 86.48 region. The latter is the 38.2 percent of
the index's decline from a high of 88.71 to its recent low of
85.09.
 The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.2213, though was still
not far from a two-week low near $1.2150 struck the previous day.
 It has support at $1.2145-55, a pivot area stemming from
intra-day lows and highs in May and June, and then at about
$1.2110, the 61.8 percent retracement of its move up from
$1.1876 to near $1.2500 in June.
 Resistance sits near Wednesday's high of $1.2224 but with a
move through $1.2250-70 needed to negate short-term bearishness.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2010 11:36PM ET</span>",POLL-Japan fund managers raise bond weightings to 1-yr high," * Fund managers boost bond weighting on economic uncertainty
 * Equity positions little changed but some say stocks cheap
 * Fund managers cut euro zone bonds to record low
 By Akiko Takeda
 TOKYO, June 30 (Reuters) - Japanese fund managers raised
their weighting for bonds to a one-year high in June, with some
worrying that fiscal woes in Europe could further destabilise
financial markets and put the global recovery at risk.
 Stock weightings were little changed from the previous month,
though some managers see equities as underpriced and say solid
corporate earnings will help share prices recover down the road.
 ""We want to make our portfolio a bit more conservative given
the uncertainty over the economic outlook, which stems from
fiscal tightening in Europe,"" said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior
strategist at Daiwa Asset Management.
 ""That tightening will no doubt hurt the European economy,
which could cause further turmoil in European financial markets,""
Nagano added.
 The average bond weighting rose to 49.2 percent from 48.4
percent in May, the highest since 49.3 percent in June last year,
according to the poll of 12 fund managers conducted June 16-24.
 The numbers are not strictly comparable with previous
results, however, because of the addition of a new fund manager
to the survey from June.
 The weighting for equities ticked up to 45.1 percent from
45.0 percent in May and from a seven-year low of 44.8 percent in
April.
 Fund managers cut their weightings for real estate to 1.2
from 1.8 percent and for alternative investments, which includes
hedge funds and private equity, to 1.3 from 1.6 percent.
 During the survey period, world share prices failed to extend
their rebound from a sharp fall in May, as weak U.S. data sparked
concerns that economic recovery in the United States may be much
more sluggish than previously thought.
 Both the U.S. Standard and Poor's Index and Japan's Nikkei
share average have lost around four percent so far this month.
 Some fund managers said the fall in global share prices since
May is a temporary adjustment as the recovery slows to a more
sustainable pace.
 Kenichi Kubo, a senior fund manager at Tokio Marine Asset
Management, said China's decision to allow more flexibility in
the yuan would also be positive for the global economy.
 ""Greater yuan flexibility will boost the purchasing power of
China ... In terms of demographic dynamics, Chinese demand is
expected to grow until 2013, which would be positive for the
world's share markets,"" Kubo said.
 Within their equity portfolios, fund managers raised their
weightings for North America to 43.5 percent from a 5 1/2-year
low of 42.0 percent in May. They also upped their weightings for
Asia to 8.5 percent, the highest level since April 1997, from 8.0
percent.
 They cut weightings for Britain to 6.1 percent from 6.4
percent, the lowest since October 2004. They also cut weightings
for euro zone and Japanese shares.
 Within bond portfolios, the weighting for euro zone debt fell
to a record low of 28.7 percent from 32.2 percent in May, as
worries about euro zone countries' public debt continued to
rattle investors.
 Managers shifted funds to U.S. and Canadian bonds, the
weighting of which jumped to a 16-month high of 30.1 percent from
25.9 percent.

 SINGAPORE, June 30 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on
Wednesday and ended the second quarter with their worst
performance since the collapse of Lehman Brothers as investors
got out of shares and high-yielding currencies on concerns over
bank funding in Europe.
 Asian stocks have slipped nearly 10 percent in the past
three months and are on course for their worst quarterly
performance since last three months of 2008, when investors
fled to safety after the Lehman collapse and Asian shares
dropped 23 percent.

 *Dollar could gain on month-end hedging requirements
 *Aussie, NZ dlrs trampled in global stampede to safety
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 30 (Reuters) - The yen and the Swiss franc
held on to broad gains on Wednesday as nervous investors rushed
to unwind leveraged carry trades on the back of a significant
deterioration in risk appetite.
 While doubts about a global recovery were playing out,
traders said, the rush towards safe-haven currencies may prove
to be short lived once quarter-end hedging and repatriation
flows are taken care of.
 Traders said the U.S. dollar <.DXY> could benefit from
month-end buying after a fall in Wall Street <.SPX> this month
left many non-U.S. investors requiring to buy dollars to
rebalance their portfolios.
 ""It is worth emphasizing that the fall in global equities
this month biases today's month-end fix towards U.S. dollar
buying,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 ""The rationale is threefold--non-U.S. investors hedge
global equity exposure more than U.S. investors do; a fall in
US equities during the month leaves non-U.S. investors
overhedged on their S&P holdings; thus hedge rebalancing
requires dollar purchases at the fix.""
 The S&P-500 index has lost over 4 percent this month and
was looking increasingly bearish on the charts.
 In Asian trade, the U.S. dollar index <.DXY> was up 0.13
percent at 86.14, and is likely to face resistance in the 86.42
to 86.48 region. The latter is the 38.2 percent of the index's
decline from a high of 88.71 to its recent low of 85.09.
 Dollar/yen  was subdued at 88.63 yen, having lost
nearly 1 percent on Tuesday as a rush to safety pushed U.S.
two-year Treasury yields to record lows. Support is seen at
around 88.00 yen, the low struck on May 6.
 The euro was softer at $1.2185, not far from a two-week low
of $1.2152 , struck in the previous session. Technical
analysts noted $1.2150 as a key level, saying a break would
open the way for a retest of the psychologically important
$1.2000 mark and the pair's four-year low around $1.1875 set on
June 7.
 The euro  was at 107.91, not far from its 8-½
year low of 107.33 yen struck on Tuesday. Against the Swiss
franc, it hovered near record lows of 1.3167 francs .
 The franc  has gained broadly since the Swiss
National Bank this month backed off its pledge to intervene in
the currency market to stem its strength and as general spike
in risk aversion saw investors veer towards safe-haven
currencies.
 Uncertainty about the global recovery grew after data
showed a steep fall in U.S. consumer confidence, a sharp
downward revision to China's leading indicator index and an
unexpected rise in in Japanese unemployment. [ID:nN29138077]
[ID:nN29126233] [ID:nTOE6190AE].
 Also acting as a concern to investors were festering
problems in the euro zone. Interbank euro funding costs rose to
an eight-month high on fears the expiry of nearly half a
trillion euros of emergency loans this week may cause strains
for some banks. For details, see [ID:nN29137639]
 Euro zone banks must repay 442 billion euros ($539 billion)
on Thursday borrowed a year ago at low rates as part of the
European Central Bank's efforts to boost liquidity. Investors
fear this could leave banks facing a liquidity shortfall.
 To offset the burden that banks will face in paying back
the money, the ECB has offered extra borrowing opportunities
for them, including unlimited three-month funds on Wednesday.
See [ID:nLDE65S20V]
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian 
and New Zealand dollars  remained under pressure. The
Aussie was flat at $0.8500, after having fallen over 1.5
percent to as low as $0.8463 offshore, the lowest since June
11.
 Support for the Aussie is seen at around $0.8425, the low
struck on June 11.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - Global stocks, commodities
and the euro tumbled on Tuesday over concerns about economic
growth and fears that some banks in Europe may be strained by
a deadline this week to repay more than half a trillion
dollars.
 The appetite for risk faded after a report showed a sharp
drop in U.S. consumer confidence, which pushed up government
debt prices and helped lift other safe havens, such as gold.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid to its lowest level
in eight months in a sell-off that analysts said could ignite
further declines.
 The euro slid to an all-time low against the Swiss franc
and an 8 1/2-year low against the yen.
 The yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note 
fell to the lowest on record, while the yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury  slid below 3 percent for the
first time since April 2009, and interbank euro funding costs

 A sharp downward revision to China's leading indicators
index and weakness in Japanese exports and unemployment added
to worries about the global recovery. [ID:nN29138077]
 Stocks in the economically sensitive sectors such as
materials, industrials and financials were among the hardest
hit.
 ""The market is extremely sensitive to the fundamental data
that we're seeing right now,"" said Gareth Sylvester, senior
currency strategist at HiFX in San Francisco.
 ""Any data that would suggest a slowdown could be more
prolonged, or the lack of evidence to support the recovery
sequence, is going to create some nervousness,"" he said.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> lost 3.1
percent and its emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> slid 2.8
percent.
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI>
tumbled 268.22 points, or 2.65 percent, to finish at 9,870.30.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> fell 33.33 points, or
3.10 percent, to end at 1,041.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index

 LIQUIDITY WORRIES

and the price of German Bunds hit three-week highs, buoyed by
the slide in U.S. Treasury yields. [ID:nLDE65S1N9]

 Fears of a potential liquidity shortfall of more than 100
billion euros in the financial system stoked the aversion to
risk as European banks were poised to repay 442 billion euros
($545.5 billion) in emergency loans on Thursday.
 European shares hit a three-week closing low, breaking a
key technical support level. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3>
index of top European shares dropped 3 percent to end at
995.82 points, the lowest close since June 9.
 The Euro STOXX 50 <.STOXX50E> fell below a retracement
level from its April high and May low, signaling more losses.
 ""It is a return to risk aversion,"" said Eugen Weinberg, a
commodity analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 Traders cited significant U.S. dollar short covering
overnight, further weighing on the euro.
 The euro  was down 0.72 percent at $1.2188, while
the dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> up 0.57 percent at 86.137.
 The risk premium on southern European government bonds
over benchmark German bunds widened and the cost of insuring
their debt against default rose. [ID:nLDE65S0PT]
 Banks were among the heaviest decliners as they prepare to
pay back the ECB money that was borrowed a year ago at rock

 Even though single-family U.S. home prices unexpectedly
climbed in April from the previous month, signs of a sustained
recovery have yet to emerge, price indexes from Standard &

 The S&P composite index of prices in 20 U.S. metropolitan

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 29 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar hit its
weakest level in three weeks against the greenback on Tuesday,
rocked by worries about world economic growth.
 Markets that often influence the movement of the Canadian
currency fell hard, with the price of oil off more than 3
percent and world stocks under pressure in a new wave of risk
aversion.
 The Canadian dollar  ended at C$1.0553 to the U.S.
dollar, or 94.76 U.S. cents, down sharply from Monday's finish
at C$1.0358 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.54 U.S. cents.
 It spent the entire North American session in negative
territory and dropped as low as C$1.0575 to the U.S. dollar, or
94.56 U.S. cents. The 1.8 percent drop was the biggest since
May 20, when it fell more than 2 U.S. cents.
 The currency's move to a June 8 low coincided with a new
2010 low on the S&P 500 index. <.SPX>
 ""That's pretty much hand in hand with the way you just saw
a downtick in the Canadian dollar,"" said Sacha Tihanyi,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital, noting the weakness got
rolling in the overnight session.
 Focus was on a series of soft economic reports and concern
about bank repayments to the European Central Bank, which
pulled the euro sharply lower. [FRX/] [ID:nN29137639]
 The hit to sentiment started when the Conference Board
revised its leading economic index for China to a 0.3 percent
gain in April from the 1.7 percent rise the group had reported
earlier. [ID:nN29126233]
 More pressure came from a report that showed U.S. consumer
confidence dropped in June. Canadian data was mixed as factory
prices rose in May, but consumer confidence faltered in June.
[ID:nN29138077] [ID:N29136753]
 The weakness of recent economic data is making the market a
little more dovish on the speed at which it expects the Bank of
Canada to raise interest rates, Tihanyi said.
 BOND PRICES JUMP
 The increasing focus on the tenuousness of the economic
recovery has seen a sharp turnaround in interest rate hike
expectations. Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade
based on expectations for the central bank's key policy rate,
now point to a less than 60 percent chance of a 25 basis point
hike on July 20. That is down from around 80 percent last week.

 That has helped Canadian government bond prices rise
recently. On Tuesday, they surged across the board, tracking
U.S. Treasuries, as equity markets dropped on worries over
euro-zone debt problems and the uneven global economy.
 ""It's clearly events overseas beginning with some question
markets about growth in China, and then obviously today's
consumer confidence report in the U.S. was a surprise on the
downside in terms of economic growth,"" said Mark Chandler, head
of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital
Markets.
 ""So the near-term momentum in the global economy, that
notion has been challenged by some of the recent indicators.""
 The two-year government bond  climbed 23 Canadian
cents to yield 1.383 percent, while the 10-year bond
 rose 52 Canadian cents to yield 3.104 percent.

 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday on
concerns about European banks' funding abilities, while the
dollar and yen gained as soft economic data from across the
globe cast doubts over the strength of economic recovery.
 The euro hit an all-time low versus the Swiss franc and an

 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian

 ""Equity markets are down heavily today and that is being
translated into some U.S. dollar strength. All the risky
currencies like the Canadian dollar, the Aussie and Kiwi have
seen notable sell-offs versus the U.S. dollar,"" Sylvester
said.
 In late trading in New York, the euro fell 0.7 percent to
$1.2190 after hitting a two-week low of $1.2152 ,
according to Reuters data.
 Technical analysts noted $1.2150 as a key level, saying a
break would open the way for a retest of the psychologically
important $1.2000 mark and the pair's four-year low around
$1.1875 set on June 7.
 The euro  was down 1.6 percent at 107.91 yen
after hitting a session low of 107.33 yen, its weakest since
late 2001. It fell to 1.3167 Swiss francs  according
to Reuters data, the lowest since the euro's 1999 launch.
 The franc has gained broadly since the Swiss National Bank
this month backed off its pledge to intervene in the currency
market to stem its strength. Comments from policymaker
Jean-Pierre Danthine on Monday bolstered this view.

in three weeks.
 The U.S. dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback
versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.6 percent to 86.121.
 Against the yen, the dollar dropped 0.9 percent to 88.54
. Lower U.S. government bond yields, with 10-year
Treasury yields  below 3 percent for the first time
since April 2009, also weighed on dollar/yen.
 Investors awaited the monthly U.S. payrolls report on
Friday that will provide more clues about the U.S. economy.
 ""It's not a good time to be long risk,"" said Douglas
Borthwick, head of trading at Faros Trading LLC, a full service
FX execution firm in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""With month-end risk reduction, coupled with a touchy
number on Friday compounded by model accounts adding to risk
aversion trades, (today's) moves could be the tip of the

 ""I would hope that the Colombia and Panamanian agreements
would be considered either contemporaneously or prior to
consideration (of) the Korean agreement,"" House of
Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters.
 Obama, after a meeting with South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak on Saturday in Toronto, said he wanted the two
countries to resolve issues blocking the Korea-U.S. (KORUS)
Free Trade Agreement by November, when South Korea will host
the next Group of 20 summit.
 The United States wants better access to South Korean auto
market than in the current agreement, which was signed three
years ago this week but never submitted to Congress because of
strong opposition from Democrats.
 Washington also has concerns about South Korean
restrictions on U.S. beef imports.
 Obama said he planned to send the South Korea agreement to
Congress for approval by early 2011.
 However, he has not laid out a similar timeline for action
on the Colombia and the Panama agreements.
 All three pacts were negotiated by the administration of
former President George W. Bush and were on Obama's desk when
he took office in January 2009.
 Hoyer said he told White House and Treasury Department
officials he supported the new push on South Korea but also
reminded them that Colombia and Panama were important friends
of the United States.
 Hoyer's comments highlight a division within the Democratic
Party on trade deals.
 Several House Democrats have criticized Obama's decision to
pursue the South Korean agreement and have warned they will
oppose it unless major changes are made.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Tuesday on
concerns about European banks' funding abilities, while the
dollar and yen gained as soft economic data from across the
globe cast doubts over the strength of economic recovery.
 The euro hit an all-time low versus the Swiss franc and an
8 1/2-year trough against the yen. Interbank euro funding costs
rose to an eight-month high on fears the expiry of nearly half
a trillion euros of emergency loans this week may cause strains
for some banks. For details, see [ID:nN29137639]
 Uncertainty about the global recovery grew after data on
Tuesday showed a steep fall in U.S. consumer confidence, a
sharp downward revision to China's leading indicators index and
weakness in Japanese exports and unemployment. [ID:nN29138077]
 ""The market is extremely sensitive to the fundamental data
that we're seeing right now,"" said Gareth Sylvester, senior
currency strategist at HiFX in San Francisco. ""Any data that
would suggest a slowdown could be more prolonged, or the lack
of evidence to support the recovery sequence, is going to
create some nervousness.""
 Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars sold off as concerns about the economy prompted
investors to pare back trades in riskier assets.
 ""Equity markets are down heavily today and that is being
translated into some U.S. dollar strength. All the risky
currencies like the Canadian dollar, the Aussie and Kiwi have
seen notably sell-offs versus the U.S. dollar,"" Sylvester said.
 In afternoon trading in New York, the euro fell 0.6 percent
to $1.2200, after hitting a two-week low of $1.2152 ,
according to Reuters data.
 Technical analysts noted $1.2150 as a key level, saying a
break would open the way for a retest of the psychologically
important $1.2000 level and the pair's four-year low around
$1.1875 set on June 7.
 The euro  was down nearly 1.4 percent at 108.12
yen after hitting a session low of 107.33 yen, its weakest
since late 2001. It fell to 1.3173 francs  according
to Reuters data, the lowest since the euro's 1999 launch.
 The franc has gained broadly since the Swiss National Bank
this month backed off its pledge to intervene in the currency
market to stem its strength. Comments from policymaker
Jean-Pierre Danthine on Monday bolstered this view.
 LIQUIDITY SHORTFALL
 Euro zone banks must repay 442 billion euros ($539 billion)
on Thursday borrowed a year ago at low rates as part of the
European Central Bank's efforts to boost liquidity. Investors
fear this could leave banks facing a liquidity shortfall.
 European Central Bank officials scrambled to reassure
nervous markets. To offset the burden that banks will face in
paying back the money, the ECB has padded the date with extra
borrowing opportunities for them, including an offer of
unlimited three-month funds on Wednesday. See [ID:nLDE65S20V]
 Europe's main barometer of investor anxiety, the VDAX-NEW
volatility index <.V1XI>, rose more than 10 percent, hitting
its highest level in three weeks.

versus a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.4 percent to
86.037. Against the safe-haven yen, the dollar dropped 0.9
percent to 88.55 yen .
 Lower U.S. government bond yields, with 10-year Treasury
yields  below 3 percent for the first time since
April 2009, also weighed on dollar/yen.

ahead of the monthly payrolls report on Friday that will
provide a key reading on the U.S. economy.
 ""It's not a good time to be long risk,"" said Douglas

 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks, commodities and

 * Measures could affect EU-Mercosur trade talks, says Ciolos
 * Greece says exports worth $2.4 million blocked since April
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 LUXEMBOURG, June 29 (Reuters) - Restrictions on food imports
by Argentina could undermine renewed talks on a free-trade
agreement between the European Union and the Mercosur group of
South American countries, EU farm ministers and officials warned
on Tuesday.
 EU countries including France, Germany and Italy backed a
complaint by Greece over Argentina's curbs, which have been
applied to imports of foods that South-America's second largest
economy already produces itself.
 ""The Argentinean restrictions will have a wholly negative
influence on the resumption of talks for the conclusion of an
EU-Mercosur agreement,"" Greece said in a memo circulated at a
meeting of EU farm ministers in Luxembourg.
 Greece said that $2.4 million worth of exports of canned
peaches had been cancelled or suspended by Argentinean importers
since April, equivalent to 40 percent of total Greek exports to
Argentina each year.
 EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos said the
restrictions were being applied to nearly all the agro-food
products the EU exports to Argentina.
 ""Aside from the illegal nature of these measures, I am
equally concerned by their announcement on the eve of the
resumption of negotiations with Mercosur,"" Ciolos told the
ministers.
 A first technical meeting between EU and Mercosur
negotiators was due to be held in Buenos Aires on Tuesday, and
Ciolos revealed that the Commission had debated whether it
should go ahead, before deciding that it should.
 ""If these measures persist, the negotiations with Mercosur
will necessarily be affected,"" Ciolos added.
 EU agriculture ministers and farming groups are strongly
opposed to any trade deal with Mercosur, which would likely see
Europe cut its import tariffs for agricultural imports in return
for greater access to Mercosur's services and telecoms markets.

 * Energy outages seen costing 4 percent of African GDP
 
 BASEL, Switzerland, May 29 (Reuters) - Africa will need to
assuage investors to secure the estimated $350 billion in
funding required for energy projects over the next two decades,
bankers and finance experts said on Tuesday.
 Jean David Bile, chairman of AES APCO, a subsidiary of the
U.S. power company AES Corp., said the African energy market
remains hard to navigate, with different regulatory and legal
regimes confusing and frustrating many outsiders.
 ""We are dealing with an emerging market that is highly
fragmented,"" he told an energy conference in Basel, Switzerland.
""It is not an insurmountable issue ... (but) investing in Africa
is going to require a very different mindset.""
 Bile, whose company is based in Cameroon, said political
instability was far less of a concern today than several decades
ago, and presents little risk to investors and private sector
actors interested in engaging in Africa.
 But he said governments needed to intervene more to confront
corruption and to discuss with investors any changes to laws
that could impact their business, especially tariff levels.
 Governments need to show they are willing to share ownership
of key assets or skittish investors will stay away, he said.
 Leslie Maasdorp, vice chairman of ABSA Capital, one of the
largest investment banks in South Africa, said the cost of power
outages can amount to 4 percent of gross domestic product in
Africa, and should be addressed with a matter of urgency.
 ""We still have some outdated industrial policies which are
working against the objective of generating new power,"" said
Maasdorp, whose bank is a unit of Barclays Capital.
 He told the Basel meeting that commercial banks like his are
increasingly giving investors and funds guidance on how to
navigate the African market as part of their offerings.
 ""Risk management is increasingly a very, very important
component,"" he said.
 Bile of AES APCO said the returns from investing in Africa's
power and energy infrastructure stood to be highly attractive
for those who manage to hold on.
 ""Emerging market situations evolve. For investors, it's
those who are flexible who are going to survive in this
environment,"" he said.

 * But BoE policymaker says BoE will tighten if necessary
 
 (Adds more quotes from speech, background)
 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - The Bank of England should be
careful not to tighten monetary policy too soon as inflation is
likely to fall and the risk of deflation has not disappeared,
policymaker Paul Fisher said in remarks published on Tuesday.
 Fisher said it was ""unlikely that substantial inflationary
pressure would be generated as the result of the recovery in
demand"" and reiterated the conclusions of the BoE's May
Inflation Report which said a recent inflation spike would pass.
 ""We need to be sensitive to the risk of tightening policy
prematurely, stifling the nascent recovery,"" Fisher said in
remarks made in a speech on June 14 in Liverpool and only
published by the Bank on Tuesday. ""The risk of deflation ... may
have faded, but it hasn't gone away.""
 ""It was sensible not to try and offset the recent rise
in inflation by tightening policy,"" he added.
 The BoE has slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5
percent and spent 200 billion pounds of newly-created money on
assets to help Britain pull out of an 18-month recession. 
 This month, the BoE froze policy but speculation has been
rife over when the central bank will start to tighten policy and
inflation hawk Andrew Sentance voted for a rate hike at the June
rate-setting meeting -- the first such vote since August 2008.
 Inflation eased in May to 3.4 percent from 3.7 percent in
April, still well above the BoE's two percent target but
suggesting that price pressures are starting to ease.
 Sentance told Reuters in an exclusive interview on Monday
that a weak pound had not helped the inflation profile.
[ID:nLDE65R20F]
 Fisher, who said a 25 percent decline in the value of
sterling since August 2007 reflected a revaluation of the UK
economy following the financial crisis, argued that sterling
weakness should only have a temporary impact on inflation.
 However, Monetary Policy Committee member Fisher also said
there was also a risk that higher price pressures could be
sustained into the medium term, indicating that the central bank
would then act to tame inflation.
 ""Our central expectations could be wrong,"" he said. ""The
MPC has the tools at its disposal to tighten monetary
conditions, both in the form of raising Bank Rate and by selling
the assets that we bought in 2009 as part of the quantitative
easing programme.""

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit an all-time low
versus the Swiss franc, while the Japanese yen rallied on
Tuesday as investors pulled back sharply from riskier assets.
 Markets are skittish about the outlook for U.S. growth
after a string of lackluster reports. Fears over euro zone
financing weighed on the euro and global equities.
 Declines in the European currency accelerated after a
report showed a steep fall in U.S. consumer confidence..
 Traders also cited significant U.S. dollar short-covering

key reading on the U.S. economy.
 ""It's not a good time to be long risk,"" said Douglas
Borthwick, head of trading at Faros Trading LLC, a full service
FX execution firm in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The yen rallied 2 percent versus the euro and 1 percent
against the greenback as European and U.S. stocks fell, raising
the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese currency, along with the
Swiss franc. Meanwhile, higher-risk currencies such as the
Australian and New Zealand dollars took a beating.
 Lower U.S. government bond yields, with 10-year Treasury
yields below 3 percent for the first time since April 2009,
also prompted investors to cut short positions in the Japanese
currency, weighing on dollar/yen.
 ""With month-end risk reduction, coupled with a touchy
number on Friday compounded by model accounts adding to risk

 In late morning trading in New York, the dollar rose 0.6
percent against a basket of major currencies.
 The euro was down nearly 2 percent after hitting a session
low of 107.33 yen, its weakest since late 2001. It fell to
1.3197 francs according to Reuters data, the lowest since the
single currency's 1999 launch.

 ""The absence of the SNB has opened up the door to 1.30 in

 Against the dollar, the euro gave up 1 percent on the day

data.
 LIQUIDITY SHORTFALL
 Euro zone banks must repay 442 billion euros ($539 billion)
on Thursday borrowed a year ago at low rates as part of the
European Central Bank's efforts to boost liquidity. Investors
fear this could leave banks facing a liquidity shortfall.
 The ECB holds a three-month tender on Wednesday which many
in the market expect will be tapped as banks scramble to pay
back the one-year funds. Expectations are that 210 billion
euros will be allotted at the offer.
 ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said the ECB is
not considering offering banks another batch of 12-month loans
to replace those expiring on Thursday.
 The funding needs reflect persistent stress in the banks of
euro zone countries including Portugal, Italy, Spain and
Greece.
 Europe's main barometer of investor anxiety, the VDAX-NEW
volatility index, rose more than 10 percent, hitting its
highest level in three weeks.
 Investors dumped higher-risk currencies including the
Australian and New Zealand dollar, which each fell more than 2
percent versus the dollar and around 2.5 percent versus the
yen.
 The yen rose and the dollar fell after the report showing
U.S. consumer confidence fell steeply in June after rising for
three months, due to worries about the labor market.
 ""Consumer confidence is fairly closely tied to consumer
spending and obviously retail sales, so this bodes ill for the
U.S. economy and perhaps the global economy to some extent as
well,"" said Andrew Busch, a currency strategist at BMO Capital
Markets, in Chicago.

ministers failed to agree on Tuesday to approve six genetically
modified (GM) maize varieties for import to the bloc, despite a
warning that inaction could lead to a shortage of animal feed.
 Following the deadlock, the import applications for use in
food and feed can now be approved unilaterally by the bloc's
executive, the European Commission.
 In principle that could happen ""within a few weeks"", but the
Commission has not yet decided whether the approval will be
granted before or after the European summer break, a spokesman
for the EU executive told Reuters.
 Before the vote, EU Health and Consumer Commissioner John
Dalli told ministers that authorisations should be approved as a
priority to avoid any repeat of last year's disruption to feed
imports.
 That was caused by the EU's zero-tolerance policy on
unapproved GM material in imports -- shipments of animal feed
from the United States were refused entry to the bloc after
minute traces of unapproved GM material were discovered in the
cargo.
 The Commission has said it will propose a small tolerance
margin for unapproved GM in imports later this year to resolve
the issue, but until then the only solution is for the EU to
approve varieties individually for import.
 One of the applications was to renew a previous EU approval
for the insect-resistant Bt11 maize, developed by Swiss-based
biotech company Syngenta, which expired in 2007.
 ""A positive endorsement would effectively have signalled to
key trading partners that the EU regulatory system for GMOs is
functioning properly and would have helped to defuse mounting
trade tensions,"" said Syngenta spokesman Medard Schoenmaeckers.
 ""Syngenta is disappointed that once again, member states
could not come to a decision.""
 The other five covered new approvals for ""stacked"" maize
varieties, developed by combining existing insect- and
herbicide-resistant GM maize varieties together using
conventional plant breeding techniques.
 One was developed by Syngenta, two were developed jointly by
subsidiaries of US chemicals companies DuPont and Dow Chemical,
and a further two were developed by Monsanto.

 * Report seen criticising Airbus over government loans
 * Interim findings on EU counter-suit expected July 16
 By Tim Hepher 
 PARIS, June 29 (Reuters) - Planemakers Airbus and Boeing
exchanged transatlantic taunts on Tuesday in advance of a World
Trade Organisation ruling expected to accuse the European
planemaker of receiving unfair state subsidies.
 Boeing and its European rival are at the centre of one of
the longest and potentially most costly trade disputes in
history, covering mutual accusations of illegal government
support in a market estimated at $3 trillion over 20 years.
 Airbus, owned by European aerospace group EADS, conceded in
March that the WTO had found that loans from European
governments contained ""a certain element of subsidy"".
 After a long wait, the findings will be released in a
1,000-page report from the trade body expected on Wednesday.
 Airbus prepared the ground for a public relations victory by
Boeing, but accused its rival of ""hypocrisy"" over other forms of
aid and urged commentators to wait for the WTO to produce its
findings on a European counter-suit in the coming months.
 ""Our competitor can be expected to make a big propaganda
splash with key words such as 'illegal subsidies', 'compliance',
'Airbus to pay back', 'affordability' and the like,"" Airbus
spokesman Stefan Schaffrath emailed to a group of journalists.
 ""This will only, once again, confirm that for them the WTO
is nothing but a hook for propaganda,"" he added.
 Boeing was confident its key claims would be upheld in line
with statements by U.S. Congress members briefed on the report.
 ""Tomorrow people will see that the WTO has, according to
politicians briefed on the matter, ruled that every instance of
launch aid that was challenged was held to be an illegal subsidy
and that $4 billion in A380 funding contained prohibited export
subsidies,"" said Boeing spokesman Charlie Miller.
 According to sources familiar with the still-confidential
ruling handed to the parties in March, a WTO trade panel called
on European governments to end illegal subsidies worth billions
of euros for Airbus in a case filed years ago by Washington.
 Boeing backers in Congress have seized on those findings to
press their case for Airbus to be penalised in a bitterly fought
$50 billion contest to supply mid-air tankers to the Pentagon.
 A second WTO panel is expected to issue a preliminary ruling
on a countersuit by the European Union over U.S. support for
Boeing on July 16, sources familiar with the matter said, but
the findings will not be made public for several months.
 Both sides have cited hundreds of examples of financial aid
for the development of new airliners, from interest-free loans
and military research spending to the construction of roads near
factories, which they say constituted unfair state support. 
 Once the first report is published the parties have 30 days
to decide whether to appeal, and a new ruling should be
delivered within 60 days. Most analysts say the feud could drag
on for several more years and may well be settled out of court.

 * EU exec aims to push through plans with minimum debate
 * Governments, industry fear impact on trade
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, June 29 (Reuters) - Plans to radically overhaul EU
rules on growing genetically modified (GM) crops are welcomed by
some as boosting productivity but others say the move will
unleash uncertainty, discord and a deluge of litigation.
 In an unprecedented step to hand EU powers back to national
capitals, the European Commission has drafted plans to let
countries decide themselves whether to grow or ban GM crops, a
gesture born of frustration over deadlock in the EU's approval
system.
 At the heart of opposition to what is in effect the EU
giving up its jealously guarded control over homogeonous farming
policy is a concern that the bloc will fracture, leaving the way
open for years of legal wrangling and conflict.
 ""GM crops are an extremely divisive subject between member
states, but if they do it for this issue, what other issues will
they do it for in future?"" said Jo Swinnen, senior research
fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies think tank in
Brussels.
 ""This is actually an enormous precedent to hand EU powers
back to the member states,"" said Swinnen.
 The rule changes would allow pro-GM countries such as Spain
and the Czech Republic to press ahead with growing newly
approved crops, opening up new markets for major biotech
companies such as Monsanto of the United States and
Switzerland's Syngenta.
 But even Spain, the EU's leading GM crop producer, has
criticised the plan for seeking to de-harmonise the bloc's
current policy on cultivation -- a view shared by other
countries including Belgium.
 
 MUDDY WATERS
 GMO champions say the crops boost yields and resistance to
disease and drought, important as sensitivities increase over
food security, but further muddying the waters the industry
itself is unsure about the EU rule changes.
 Biotech companies, rather than sensing an opportunity, say
the proposals would create legal uncertainty throughout the
production chain and spark internal market disputes.
 ""You're going to have different rules in different EU
countries. It's just inviting legal disputes, and the lawyers
are going to love it,"" said Julian Little, spokesman for German
biotech firm Bayer CropScience.
 But having defended the EU's current GM policy in global
trade disputes and taken the flak for approving GM products when
member states were undecided, the Commission appears determined
to push through its plans.
 The proposals have been designed to try and minimise the
chances for governments or the European Parliament to block or
change them.
 The first element of the proposals are non-compulsory
guidelines to member states on the ""coexistence"" of GM and
non-GM farming, designed to introduce the change in policy as
soon as they are tabled on July 13.
 As the guidelines are non-legislative, they can be adopted
by the Commission with no opportunity for governments to block
them, but it would still be for countries to decide whether or
not to act on them.
 Knowing that this is a stop-gap measure at best, the
Commission will also propose a legal change allowing countries
to ban GM crops for reasons other than health and safety or
coexistence grounds.
 The idea is to limit the legislative debate to this change
alone without opening up the legislation to a full and complex
revision, but some doubt it will work.
 ""Politically speaking, the Commission can ask the European
Parliament and Council for a restricted procedure, but there's
nothing legally to stop the parliament from opening up the whole
legislation (on GMO cultivation),"" Greenpeace GMO policy
director and former lawyer Marco Contiero said.
 
 TRADE CONCERNS
 By allowing countries to ban GM crops that have been
scientifically assessed and approved for cultivation at EU
level, some argue the Commission is setting a dangerous
precedent.
 ""Moving away from scientific risk assessment as the basis of
decision making may seriously affect public biotechnology
research in the EU, and confidence in science in general,"" said
Piet van der Meer of the Public Research and Regulation
Initiative (PRRI), a network of public sector biotechnology
scientists.
 It could also lead to fresh trade disputes, after the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) largely backed a complaint brought
against the EU in 2003 by the United States, Canada and
Argentina, who argued the bloc was failing to apply its own
scientific approval procedures to GM products.
 Under the Commission's proposals, individual countries could
be targeted in future trade disputes for their policies on GM
cultivation, and the U.S. and others may be more willing to file
WTO complaints than if the EU was acting in unison.
 
 UNCERTAIN IMPACT
 GM cultivation in Europe -- currently less than 100,000
hectares compared with 134 million worldwide -- will only rise
if the proposals result in approvals of more GMOs at EU level,
even if dissenters subsequently ban them in their own countries.
 Serial abstainers include France and Ireland, while
no-voters number Greece, Austria and Luxembourg.
 ""These countries fundamentally, philosophically, party
politically always vote no, and will continue to do that even if
you give them the opportunity to opt out later,"" argued Little.
 But after more than a decade in the firing line, the
Commission's priority now is to let member states take
responsibility for their own GM crop policies, and the political
controversy that surrounds them.

 By Vivianne Rodrigues
 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit an all-time low
versus the Swiss franc and an 8-1/2-year trough against the yen
on Tuesday as anxiety over the expiry of a key euro zone
refinancing program this week mounted.
 Investors shunned riskier assets and traders cited
significant U.S. dollar short covering overnight, further
weighing on the euro.
 The yen rallied as a 2 percent fall in European shares
<.FTEU3> raised the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese currency,
along with the Swiss franc and the dollar, while the high-risk
Australian and New Zealand dollars took a beating.
 Lower U.S. government bond yields, with 10-year Treasury
yields  at below 3 percent for the first time since
April 2009, also prompted investors to cut short positions in
the Japanese currency, weighing on dollar/yen.
 With markets skittish over Europe's finances and the global
growth outlook, investors decided to take an earlier look at
the U.S. government's payrolls report due on Friday, traders
said.
 ""We see all of this as a consequence of significant paring
of risk ahead of Friday's (U.S.) non-farm payrolls,"" said
Douglas Borthwick, head of trading at Faros Trading LLC, a full
service FX execution firm in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""It's not a good time to be long risk, and we expect with
month-end risk reduction, coupled with a touchy number on
Friday compounded by model accounts adding to risk aversion
trades, the moves we saw overnight could be the tip of the
iceberg,"" he added.
 In morning trading in New York, the dollar rose 0.6 percent
against a basket of major currencies <.DXY>.
 The euro  was down 1.4 percent to 108.17 yen
after hitting its weakest since late 2001 at 107.80 earlier in
the day, and fell to 1.3238 francs  according to
Reuters data, the lowest since the single currency's 1999
launch.
 The Swiss franc has gained broadly since the Swiss National
Bank earlier this month backed off its pledge to intervene in
the currency market to stem franc strength. Comments from
policymaker Jean-Pierre Danthine on Monday bolstered this view.
 ""The absence of the SNB has opened up the door to 1.30 in
euro/Swiss franc,"" said Borthwick. 
 Against the dollar, the euro gave up 0.7 percent on the day
to hit a two-week low of $1.2178 earlier , according to
Reuters data.
 On Thursday, banks must repay 442 billion euros ($539
billion) borrowed a year ago at low rates as part of the
European Central Bank's efforts to boost liquidity, which
investors fear could leave the banks facing a liquidity
shortfall.
 The ECB holds a three-month tender on Wednesday which many
in the market expect will be tapped as banks scramble to pay
back the one-year funds. Expectations are that 210 billion
euros will be allotted at the offer. [ID:nLDE65R1NZ]
 ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said the ECB is
not considering offering banks another batch of 12-month loans
to replace those expiring on Thursday. [ID:nFAE000016]
 The funding needs reflect persistent stress in the banks of
euro zone countries including Portugal, Italy, Spain and
Greece.
 Europe's main barometer of investor anxiety, the VDAX-NEW
volatility index <.V1XI>, rose more than 10 percent, hitting
its highest level in three weeks.
 RISK ANXIETY
 A 3 percent fall in oil prices  and a 4 percent drop
in Shanghai stock market <.SSEC> also prompted investors to
dump higher-risk currencies including the Australian 
and New Zealand dollar , which each fell more than 1
percent versus the dollar and around 2.5 percent versus the
yen.
 Boris Simonder, a technical analyst at Nordea said net
short positions on the euro/dollar in percentage terms have
been only slightly trimmed following its short-covering rally
earlier this month.
 The current net short stood at 31.7 percent, down from 36.7
percent two weeks ago though higher than one week ago,
according to Nordea.
 ""We continue to hold the view that the primary price trend
for euro/dollar is still bearish and negative,"" he said.

of an integrated European power market because of its
geographical location and active derivatives trading.
 ""Germany is one of the largest power markets with comparably
high liquidity, and in addition to that it is a transit market,
which makes it even more attractive,"" Torsten Amelung, Managing
Director and Head of Trading at Statkraft Markets in Germany
told Reuters. Owned by the Norwegian state, Statkraft has around
2,000 megawatt of generation capacity in Germany
 For financial traders it is the active derivatives market
that makes Germany attractive.
 ""Germany's active forward power market makes it possible for
foreign traders to use German futures as a proxy to hedge their
own spot trades, or to make an outright bet on euro-based
financial products,"" a London-based bank trader said.
 
 LOCATION
 Germany has nine land borders (Austria, Belgium, Czech
Republic, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland and
Switzerland), and its 80 million population and GDP of over 3
trillion dollars also top the list of the European Union's 27
member states.
 Liquidity and transit opportunities were key in boosting
Germany's power market after its liberalization a decade ago.
 ""Power grids look like road networks, and because of its
high population and industrial output, nowhere in Europe are
roads more interconnected than in Germany, and it's the same
with Germany's power grid,"" one German cross-border trader said.
""On the physical market we can use the German interconnectors to
direct power flows to where they are needed.""
 As a result, physical spot traders as far South as Italy use
the German market to buy wholesale electricity, and then
transport it through interconnectors with France, Switzerland or
Austria into Italy.
Despite the large amount of interconnectors, Amelung said
current capacities were not yet sufficient, ""especially with
regards to the planned increase of wind power generation.""
 But should existing plans for more grid capacity be
implemented, Amelung said it would be realistic to expect an
integrated continental European power market within a few years.
 
 DERIVATIVES
 While other European countries also have liquid spot
markets, it is the high volumes in forward trading that make
Germany's power market stand out.
 Annual open interest in German power derivatives trading is
around 30 billion euros, according to European Energy Exchange
(EEX) data. Adding to this is a comparable amount in the more
opaque bilateral trading, the so-called over-the-counter (OTC)
market.
 This compares to around 2 billion euros of exchange-based
open interest in France, Europe's next biggest forward power
market.
 These market foundations have also led to the arrival of
large amounts of financial traders, and today nearly 40 of EEX's
roughly 200 members are from London, the heart of European
finance.
By volume EEX, which is 10 years old this year, estimates
that around 40 percent of all derivatives trading in Germany
comes from financial traders.
 This was the final step in making German power derivative
trading attractive.
 ""In bringing together the buy side with the sell side, the
German power market transformed itself from being a market for
physical delivery in to one that can be used as a financial
market to invest into euro denominated energy products,"" one
London-based trader said.
 
 PROBLEMS
 Despite the successes of the past decade, most of Europe's
power markets-including Germany's-remain immature.
 Only the Nordic NordPool market region is considered mature,
as the majority of deals here are conducted through its
exchange, and generation information is provided timely and free
of charge.
 Because of its maturity, NordPool was used as an example by
the European Commission in the late 1990s when it drove for
energy market liberalisation in the rest of Europe.
 In Germany, by contrast, fully covered real-time power
generation is still not publicly available and there is no
system in place for urgent market messages giving an indication
about changes with regards to generation.
 Another unsolved problem for all European power exchanges is
the failure to attract other energy commodities to trade on its
platforms.
 NordPool, EEX, as well as Dutch-British APX-Endex, offer
other energy commodities such as carbon allowances, natural gas
or coal, but no power exchange has so far succeeded to attract
significant business in these fields.
 Carbon trading has been snatched up by specialised exchanges
such as French Bluenext and London's ECX, natural gas in Europe
mainly goes through the ICE in London, and coal remains largely
OTC-driven.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2010 08:32AM ET</span>",POLL-Rising bond yields restrained by economy doubts," * Economists pare back forecasts for rising govt bond yields
 * Doubt about economic recovery, low interest rates cited
 * 50-50 chance of Spain losing last ""AAA"" rating in 12 mths
 
 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Big questions about the
durability of the global economic recovery will slow the rise of
government bond yields towards pre-crisis levels, according to a
quarterly Reuters poll of bond strategists.
 New-found zeal for austerity measures among European
governments, signs of a slowing global economy and the
likelihood of ultra-low central bank interest rates for some
time yet, prompted the 50 respondents to cut their forecasts for
how high bond yields will go.
 There were marked downgrades for the 10-year bund yield
forecasts, which saw analysts chopping between 35 and 48 basis
points for each of their three-, six- and 12-month median
forecasts compared to the March poll.
 Showing the extent of the change in sentiment, forecasters a
year ago thought U.S., British and euro zone 10-year yields
would have returned to pre-crisis levels by now, nearing or
exceeding the 4 percent mark.
 But as of Tuesday, euro zone  and U.S.
 10-year bonds were yielding less than 3 percent --
the latter at their lowest level since April 2009.
 ""I think we're at a very fine dividing line at the current
time, but at the moment the majority of the flow we see is
people going into bonds purely because of their safety factor,""
said Stephen Pope at Cantor Fitzgerald.
 Investors will be looking for encouraging signs of corporate
results in the next earnings season that could drive people away
from government bonds and back into equities, he added.
 Government bonds rallied on Tuesday as stock markets fell,
with the two-year Treasury yield hitting a record low and the
10-year gilt hitting tracking its American equivalent to hit a
14-month low.

 RATES AND RATINGS
 The subdued bond yield forecasts in the latest poll were
heavily influenced by expectations for central banks to keep
ultra-low interest rates for some time to come, given the
fragility of the recovery.
 Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve renewed its vow to keep
rates exceptionally low for an extended period and scaled back
its assessment of the pace of recovery, while expressing caution
about market volaility caused by the euro zone debt crisis.
 Forecasters saw the 10-year T-note yield rising to 3.50
percent in three months, 3.75 percent in six and 4.1 percent in
a year's time -- far lower than the corresponding forecasts of
3.85 percent, 3.95 percent and 4.23 percent in March's poll.
 ""Employment reports over the summer are likely to increase
pressure (on yields),"" said Kenneth Broux of Lloyds Banking
Group. ""If U.S. job growth stalls and reverses and
disinflationary inflation trends are not reversed in the U.S.
and the EU, then we believe that long-term yields have further
scope to fall in Q3.""
 Economists polled by Reuters expect U.S. non-farm payrolls
for June -- a key measure of the health of the jobs market -- to
fall 110,000. Anything worse would support the findings of
forward-looking surveys suggesting a slowdown ahead.
 ""Fiscal tightening at the federal level, at the state and
local level, and abroad is not going to help,"" said Scott Brown
of Raymond James.
 Similarly, extended low interest rates in the euro zone will
depress yields as well the three-month euro LIBOR, which is now
seen hitting 1.35 percent in 12 months compared to 1.73 percent
forecast in March's poll.
 That is still more than twice as high as Tuesday's fixing of
0.688 percent, although this will likely rise at a faster pace
soon once banks have repaid 442 billion euros ($539.4 billion)
of one-year liquidity to the European Central Bank by July 1.
[ECB/REFI]
 In the euro zone, while a commitment to austerity measures
from governments has likely lessened the risk of downgrades to
sovereign credit ratings, significant risks remain.
 A smaller sample of respondents who answered an extra
question on this said there was a 50-50 chance Spain would lose
its remaining ""AAA"" top-notch credit rating from Moody's over
the next year. They assigned a 10 percent chance of France or
Britain losing their ""AAA"" ratings in each case.
 As for euro zone countries most likely to suffer a failed
bond auction over the next year, Portugal proved the most
popular pick.

 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit an all-time low

worries about stress tests of European banks and also the
rollover of ECB's long-term repo operations that will be taking
place in the next couple of days,"" said Paul Robson, currency
strategist at RBS Global Banking.
 ""People are a little bit negative on the outlook for growth
and recovery, and therefore selling the high-yielding
currencies.""
 By 1136 GMT, the dollar rose 0.6 percent against a basket of
major currencies.
 The euro was down 1.4 percent to 108.17 yen after hitting
its weakest since late 2001 at 107.80 earlier in the day, and
fell to 1.3238 francs according to Reuters data, the lowest
since the single currency's 1999 launch.
The Swiss franc has gained broadly since the Swiss National
Bank earlier this month backed off its pledge to intervene in
the currency market to stem franc strength. Comments from
policymaker Jean-Pierre Danthine on Monday bolstered this view.
 Against sterling, the common currency fell to 80.89 pence,
its weakest since November 2008. It gave up 0.7 percent on the
day to hit a two-week low of $1.2178, according to Reuters data.
 Pressuring the euro were concerns that banks on Thursday
must repay 442 billion euros ($539 billion) borrowed a year ago
at low rates as part of the European Central Bank's efforts to
boost liquidity.
 The ECB holds a three-month tender on Wednesday which many
in the market expect will be tapped as banks scramble to pay
back the one-year funds. Expectations are that 210 billion euros
will be allotted at the offer.
 ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said the ECB is
not considering offering banks another batch of 12-month loans
to replace those expiring on Thursday.
 The funding needs reflect persistent stress in the banks of
euro zone countries including Portugal, Italy, Spain and Greece.
 Europe's main barometer of investor anxiety, the VDAX-NEW
volatility index, rose more than 10 percent, hitting its highest
level in three weeks.
 
 RISK ANXIETY
 A 2 percent fall in oil prices and a 4 percent drop in
Shanghai stock market also prompted investors to dump
higher-risk currencies including the Australian and New Zealand
dollar, which each fell nearly 2 percent versus the dollar and
around 2.5 percent versus the yen.
 Nordea said net short positions on the euro/dollar in
percentage terms have been only slightly trimmed following its
short-covering rally earlier this month.
 The current net short stood at 31.7 percent, down from 36.7
percent two weeks ago though higher than one week ago, it said
in a note, adding that it remained ""bearish and negative"" on the
euro/dollar.

 * Iran upbeat in face of sanctions
 * Natural gas imports from Turkmenistan increase
 
 By Ramin Mostafavi
 TEHRAN, June 29 (Reuters) - Iran sees no risks to its
gasoline imports, an oil official said on Tuesday, a day after
France's Total joined the list of Western oil companies stopping
sales to Iran due to sanctions.
 The head of the National Iranian Oil Products Distribution
Company told the oil ministry website SHANA that consumption was
declining, helping trim Iran's reliance on gasoline imports.
 ""Under any conditions we are able to supply the country's
gasoline needs and there is no problem in producing or importing
gasoline,"" said Farid Ameri, sharing the optimism of President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who has dismissed the sanctions threat.
 The world's fifth-largest oil producer lacks sufficient
refining capacity and imports up to 40 percent of its gasoline
needs -- making it potentially vulnerable to sanctions which the
West is pushing to squeeze Iran over its nuclear programme.
 Ahmadinejad said on Monday Iran could become self-sufficient
in gasoline ""within one week"" if necessary.
 As well as attempting to increase domestic refinery output,
Iran is trying to reduce demand -- a policy that will be
intensified later this year when a major phase-out of government
subsidies begins.
 Last week, the U.S. Congress approved unilateral measures
that went far beyond the latest wave of U.N. sanctions --
including penalties for companies supplying Iran with gasoline.

 Iran says its uranium enrichment programme is entirely
peaceful and that it is not seeking a nuclear bomb.
 Ameri said average daily gasoline consumption in the first
three months of this year was 62.8 million litres (13.81 million
Imp gallons), down from 64.4 million year-on-year. Average daily
domestic production was 44.6 million litres, he said.
 Ameri also said Iran's stocks of gasoline were up 500
million litres in the period March 21 to June 2, compared with
the same period a year ago. He did not disclose Iran's total
stock levels.
 
 GAS FROM TURKMENISTAN
 In separate comments, an energy official said Iran was
signing a contract with Turkmenistan to increase its annual
imports of natural gas from its northern neighbour to 14 billion
cubic metres from 8 billion previously.
 Although it has the world's second-largest natural gas
reserves, after Russia, Iran has so far been unable to exploit
the resource to become a net exporter. 
 Javad Oji, head of the National Iranian Gas Company, said a
pipeline under construction to export gas to Pakistan could
transport more than first agreed. Talks under way could see
Pakistan buying 30 million cubic metres per day, rather than the
21.5 million foreseen in existing agreements, he said.
 Pakistan's position on sanctions has wavered, but on June 22
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani said it was ""not bound to
follow"" U.S. moves.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit a lifetime low
against the Swiss franc and an 8 1/2-year trough versus the yen
on Tuesday as stocks weakened and investors braced for a key
euro zone refinancing programme to expire this week.
 The yen rallied as a 2 percent fall in European shares
raised the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese currency, along
with the Swiss franc and the dollar, while the high-risk
Australian and New Zealand dollars took a beating.
 ""Equity markets are weak, so there's been a reasonably large
reverse in risk-taking behaviour,"" said Daragh Maher, senior
currency strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""It's been an amplified reaction, due to limited liquidity,
and it will be difficult to tell how far the selling will
extend.""
 By 0944 GMT, the euro had fallen more than 1.5 percent on
the day to 107.80 yen according to trading platform EBS, its
weakest since late 2001. It fell to 1.3250 francs the lowest
since the single currency's 1999 launch.
 The Swiss franc has gained broadly since the Swiss National
Bank earlier this month backed off its pledged to intervene in
the currency market to stem franc strength.
 Against sterling, the single currency fell to 80.92 pence,
its weakest since November 2008. It fell roughly 0.7 percent on

 Pressuring the euro were concerns that banks on Thursday

 Analysts said such funding needs reflected ongoing stress in
the banking sectors of some euro zone countries, including
Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, which were pushing
the euro lower.
 ""Investors are worried that PIIGS banks may take significant
liquidity from the system (in the three-month offer),"" said John
Hydeskov, senior currency analyst at Danske in Copenhagen.
 ECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said the
central bank would do everything necessary to make sure the
expiry of the one-year funding programme passed smoothly.

 
 RISK AVERSION
 A 2 percent fall in oil prices also prompted investors to
dump higher-risk currencies including the Australian and New
Zealand dollar, which each fell nearly 2 percent versus the
dollar and around 2.5 percent versus the yen.
 The Japanese currency also rallied against the dollar, which
fell to 88.54 yen, its weakest since early May.
 Some in the market said not all yen strength was being
driven by safe-haven flows, with some pointing out that a drop
in U.S. Treasury yields, which makes U.S. debt less attractive
to Japanese investors, had also been weighing on dollar/yen.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell below the key
3 percent level to strike a 14-month low.
 Financial markets will also closely watch debt auctions by
France and Spain later this week after tepid demand for Italy's
sale of 7 billion euros of government bonds on Monday kept
investors worried about euro zone debt problems.

 * Any big tax increase would damage confidence and growth
 * Economic growth of 2.0 pct from 2011 is possible
 
 PARIS, June 29 (Reuters) - France will need up to 10 years
to sort out its state finances and must not move too quickly for
fear of damaging economic growth prospects, ECB central
Governing Council member Christian Noyer said on Tuesday.
 Noyer, who also serves as governor of the Bank of France,
said any generalised tax increases would be damaging and
welcomed the government's decision to focus on spending cuts and
structural reforms as it seeks to reduce the deficit.
 ""I think we will need quite a few years, probably between
five and 10 years (to exit fully the crisis),"" Noyer told Europe
1 radio. ""If we move very, very quickly there will be a negative
impact on growth. You will need at least five years,"" he added.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy has ruled out broad tax increases
as his government struggles to suppress the deficit, which is
due to hit a record 8 percent of gross domestic product this
year, saying instead the state must cut back on spending.
 France has told the European Union it will get back to
Brussels' ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product for the
budget deficit by 2013.
 Noyer said the key to building economic growth was to kindle
consumer confidence.
 ""Today the main risk for growth is that households, which
means you and men, fear that to balance the books there will
have to be a huge increase in taxes,"" he said.
 Data released earlier on Tuesday showed French consumer
confidence worsened in June as households fretted about living
standards and unemployment. [ID:nPAB008413]
 Noyer added that the government's forecast for economic
growth of 1.4 percent in 2010 was ""reasonable"".
 Asked about 2011, he said: ""I hope that we will do better. I
hope that we have growth of around 2.0 percent but that depends
on all of us. ... We could get there if we have confidence, if
companies invest and hire.""
 The government is targeting growth of 2.5 percent from 2011.
 It has announced a crackdown on tax breaks and a cut in
ministry spending in its effort to lower the deficit to 6
percent of GDP in 2011. With an eye to longer term financing,
the government is also looking to push through pension reform.
""The decisions announced by the French government seem very
clear,"" Noyer said. ""I am convinced it can (reduce the deficit)
without wrecking growth.""

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a 2-1/2 week
low on Tuesday while oil and the euro tumbled as investors
fretted over the funding situation of banks about to repay 442
billion euros ($545.5 billion) to the European Central Bank.
 Banks must repay on Thursday money borrowed a year ago at
rock bottom rates, leaving a potential liquidity shortfall in
the financial system of more than 100 billion euros.
 The ECB holds a three-month tender on Wednesday that many in
the market expect will be tapped as banks scramble to pay back
the one-year funds. Expectations are that 210 billion euros will
be allotted at the offer.
 The state of banks will become clearer when the details of
bank stress tests are published next month.
 Sources told Reuters on Monday that more than 100 banks in
Europe will be examined in a second round of stress tests to
gauge how well they can handle shocks to the financial system.
 Investors worry that the fragile banking sector may weigh on
global growth, which is already showing pockets of weakness,
especially in the euro zone.
 ""There are still concerns about growth coming to a grinding
halt and that the sovereign debt problems are much higher than
we think,"" said David Buik, senior partner at BGC partners.
The MSCI world equity index fell 1.2 percent while the
FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.8 percent.
 Emerging stocks dropped by 1.8 percent.
 U.S. stock futures were down more than 1 percent, pointing
to a weaker open on Wall Street later.
 Chinese stocks fell 4 percent to a 14-month low as investors
started pulling funds from the market to prepare for a major
initial public offering by Agricultural Bank of China, pointing
to tight liquidity in China's markets.
 
 RISK TAKEN OFF
 The euro fell 0.7 percent to $1.2187 and hit record lows of
1.3250 against the safe-haven Swiss franc.
 The euro lost more than 1 percent to fresh 8-1/2-year lows
of 107.83 yen.
 ""Equity markets are weak, so there's been a reasonably large
reverse in risk-taking behaviour,"" said Daragh Maher, senior
currency strategist at Credit Agricole.
 ""It's been an amplified reaction, due to limited liquidity,
and it will be difficult to tell how far the selling will

 The dollar rose 0.6 percent against a basket of major
currencies.
 U.S. crude oil fell 2 percent after forecasts indicated
tropical storm Alex would skirt the main production region in
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, limiting disruptions to a few
precautionary shutdowns.

 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro slumped to a lifetime
low against the Swiss franc and a 1-1/2-year trough versus
sterling on Tuesday, stung by liquidity concerns before a key
euro zone refinancing programme expires this week.
 The yen rallied on speculation of domestic repatriation
flows before the second quarter ends this week and falls in
global stocks cranked up the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese
currency, as well as the Swiss franc and the dollar.
 Pressuring the euro were concerns that banks on Thursday
must repay 442 billion euros borrowed a year ago at rock-bottom

 ""Investors are worried that PIIGS banks may take significant
liquidity from the system.""
 ECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said the
central bank would do everything necessary to make sure the
expiry of the one-year funding programme passed smoothly.

 The euro fell to 1.3250 francs according to trading platform
EBS, the lowest since the single currency was launched in 1999.
By 0751 GMT, it had pulled back to around 1.3290 francs.
 The euro has lost roughly 4 percent against the Swiss franc
since mid-June when the Swiss central bank backed off a pledge
to fight excessive franc appreciation. It has shed about 10
percent this year.
 Against sterling, the single currency fell to 81.10 pence,
its weakest since November 2008, while the euro fell 1.3
percent on the day to 108.20 yen. It fell nearly half a percent
to $1.2225.
 
 RISK AVERSION
 The yen benefited from broad risk aversion as European
shares fell 1.6 percent, tracking a fall in Asian stock markets.
 This prompted investors to dump higher-risk currencies
including the Australian and New Zealand dollar, pushing each of
them down roughly 2 percent versus the low-yielding yen.
 The Japanese currency also rallied against the dollar, which
fell 0.8 percent to 88.60 yen.
 Some in the market said not all yen strength was being
driven by safe-haven flows, with some pointing out that a drop
in U.S. Treasury yields, which makes U.S. debt less attractive

 TOKYO, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro hit a lifetime low
against the Swiss franc and a three-week trough versus the yen on
Tuesday on funding jitters ahead of a deadline for European banks
to repay money to the European Central Bank.
 The yen also benefited as Japanese exporters repatriated
earnings ahead of the second quarter end, selling euros and
dollars, and as a steep fall in Shanghai stocks added to the
Japanese currency's safe-haven allure.
 Against the dollar, the euro fell 0.4 percent on the day to
$1.2235 after losing 0.8 percent on Monday.
 The euro has lost 4 percent against the Swiss franc since
mid-June when the Swiss central bank backed off a pledge to fight
excessive franc appreciation, shedding about 10 percent this
year. A dealer at a Swiss bank said on Tuesday there was no sign
of the central bank so far.
 European banks must repay 442 billion euros ($545.5 billion)
to the ECB on Thursday, leaving a potential liquidity shortfall
in the financial system of over 100 billion euros.
 ""Investors are nervous, shifting their attention back to
Europe because a massive amount of money will move there,"" said
Hideki Hayashi, global economist at Mizuho Securities.
 ""The euro could revisit its eight-year low against the yen,
although I think funding worries linked to repayments to the ECB
are a bit overdone.""
 The euro fell as low as 1.3250 francs, the weakest since its
1999 launch, while the dollar edged down 0.2 percent to 1.0846
francs, above Monday's two-month low of 1.0817.
 ""For the dollar/swiss, the decline continues to develop in an
impulsive manner, with the focus on the 1.0795 trendline support
from the November 2009 low, as the euro/swiss maintains the
one-way decline with little evidence of a reversal,"" JP Morgan
said in a report.
 Selling was also seen on the Australian dollar, which slid
1.6 percent on the day to 76.61 yen as the slide in Shanghai
stocks and falls in other Asian equity markets prompted flight
from higher-yielding assets.
 Shanghai stocks were down 3.9 percent as investors pulled
funds from the market to prepare for a major IPO by Agricultural
bank of China.
 The euro dropped 1 percent to its weakest in three weeks at
108.62 yen, towards an 8 1/2-year trough of 108.06 yen struck on
EBS on June 7.
 The dollar hit an eight-week low at 88.60 yen.
 Another trader at UK bank said not all yen strength was
'safe-haven' driven. A drop in U.S. Treasury yields, which makes

its highest in nearly two months at $1.5130 on Monday, when Bank
of England policymaker Andrew Sentance told Reuters drastic tax
hikes and spending cuts in Britain would not delay the start of a
tightening cycle..
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was 0.2
percent higher at 85.817, holding above last week's low around
85.09, which was seen as near-term support.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro was under pressure on
Tuesday, slipping against the yen and holding near its latest
record low against the safe-haven Swiss franc as funding concerns
in the euro zone made investors nervous.
 The euro slid to a three-week low on the yen, which gained
broadly, and inched lower on the dollar after losing 0.8 percent
on Monday, with small stop-loss sell orders expected just below
current price action, in the $1.2260/30 area.
 The Swiss franc has strengthened steeply on the euro and the
dollar over the past month, and the single European currency hit
its lowest ever level on Monday at 1.3329 francs after barriers
and stop loss sell orders at 1.3400 were taken out.
 The euro has lost 4 percent since mid-June when the Swiss
central bank backed off a pledge to fight excessive franc
appreciation, shedding about 10 percent this year, and a dealer
at a Swiss bank said on Tuesday there was no sign of the central
bank so far.
 Instead funding pressures in the euro zone on concerns ahead
of bank repayments to the European Central Bank this week as well
as debt auctions were keeping investors wary.
 ""Renewed debt stress stories...have weighed a bit on the euro
and led to renewed safe-haven parking in the yen and Swiss
franc,"" the dealer said.
 ""Investors' sentiment towards peripheral Europe remains
cautious and fragile to say the least.""
 The euro softened 0.1 percent to 1.3336 francs, after
dropping 1.5 percent on Monday, while the dollar eased to 1.0875
francs, above Monday's two-month low of 1.0817.
 ""For the dollar/swiss, the decline continues to develop in an
impulsive manner, with the focus on the 1.0795 trendline support
from the November 2009 low, as the euro/swiss maintains the
one-way decline with little evidence of a reversal,"" JP Morgan
said in a report.
 The yen lurched higher in the Asian session with some talk of
Japanese exporters repatriating earnings, selling euros and
dollars for yen. Selling was also seen on the Australian dollar,
which fell 0.8 percent on the day to 77.27 yen.
 The euro dropped 0.5 percent to its weakest in three weeks at
109.16 yen, while the dollar hit a six-week low at 89.02 yen.
 Another trader at UK bank said not all yen strength was
'safehaven' driven. A drop in U.S. Treasury yields, which makes
U.S. debt less attractive to Japanese investors, had also been
weighing a bit on dollar/yen.
 The euro was also hovering near this week's 1-½ year low on
sterling at 81.215 pence, as funding pressures in the euro zone
re-emerged with interbank lending rates there hitting their
highest in almost seven months on Monday.
 Banks must repay 442 billion euros ($545.5 billion) to the

percent higher at 85.702, holding above last week's low around
85.09, which was seen as near-term support.

 SINGAPORE, June 29 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Tuesday

the end of 2008, while funding concerns in the euro zone sent
the single currency tumbling to a record low against the Swiss
franc.

 World stock markets rebounded strongly in 2009, but
investors are now fretting about the uncertainty of the outlook

dragged down by losses against the Swiss franc. It fell 0.2
percent on the day to touch 1.3323 francs  on trading
platform EBS, the weakest since its launch in 1999.
 The pair has now lost 4 percent since June 17, when the
Swiss central bank backed off from a pledge to fight excessive
appreciation in the franc.
 Traders in Asia said investors were wary of growth-linked
currencies and the euro amid festering problems in the euro
zone, where funding pressures re-emerged with interbank lending
rates hitting their highest in almost seven months on Monday.

 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 29 (Reuters) - The euro was under pressure on
Tuesday and dangerously close to a key support level, as funding
concerns about the euro zone drove investors to the safe-haven
Swiss franc.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was at $1.2276, having lost
0.8 percent on Monday, to be just above near-term support at
$1.2254, the low struck on June 25.
 The euro was dragged down by losses against the Swiss franc.
It was trading at 1.3348 francs , having dropped to a
record low of 1.3329 in the previous session after barriers and
stop loss sell orders at 1.3400 were taken out.
 The pair has now lost 4 percent since June 17, when the Swiss
central bank backed off from a pledge to fight excessive
appreciation in the franc.
 Swiss National Bank board member Jean-Pierre Danthine seemed
was quoted in the l'agefi newspaper as saying deflationary risks
have disappeared and Swiss exports have proven to be robust
despite a stronger currency.
 For details, see [ID:nWEA7639].
 Danthine's comments boosted the Swiss , and the dollar
fell as low as 1.0818 francs on Monday. In Asian trade, it was
steady at 1.0866 francs .
 ""For the dollar/swiss, the decline continues to develop in an
impulsive manner, with the focus on the 1.0795 trendline support
from the November 2009 low, as the euro/swiss maintains the
one-way decline with little evidence of a reversal,"" JP Morgan
said in a morning report.
 Traders said investors were getting a bit wary about
growth-linked currencies and the euro amid festering problems in

 Financial markets will closely watch debt auctions by France
and Spain later this week after tepid demand for Italy's sale of
7 billion euros of government bonds on Monday kept worries about
euro zone debt troubles alive.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Italian, French
and Spanish government bonds, rather than euro zone benchmark
German Bunds, all widened.
 Against sterling, the euro was down at 81.32 pence
, having hit a 1-1/2-year low on Monday.
 The pound  was lifted by comments from Bank of
England policymaker Andrew Sentance who told Reuters that drastic
tax hikes and spending cuts of the new government in Britain
would not delay the start of a tightening cycle. [ID:nLAG006324].
 Sterling was up 0.06 percent at $1.5101, having risen nearly
0.3 percent on Monday.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was 0.02
percent higher at 85.665, holding above last week's low around
85.09, which was seen as near-term support.
 Against the yen, the dollar edged down to 89.32 yen ,
not far from a five-week low of 89.06 struck on trading platform

957,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2010 06:34PM ET</span>",US slaps duties on electric blankets from China," WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - The United States has
slapped final duties ranging up to almost 175 percent on about
$56 million of electric blankets from China because of unfair
pricing, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday.
 The decision is a victory for Florida company Jarden
Consumer Solutions, which filed a petition last year asking for
anti-dumping protection against the Chinese product.
 U.S. manufacturers have won dozens of duties against
Chinese competitors in recent years, straining trade ties.
 China has accused the United States of protectionism in the
cases, while U.S. officials say the duties are needed to
protect vulnerable U.S. industries from unfair practices.
 U.S. imports of the electric blankets from China rose to
$55.9 million in 2009, from $29.7 million in 2008.
 Hung Kuo Electronics Company, Ningbo V.K. Industry &
Trading, Ningbo Jifa Electrical Appliances Company and Ningbo
Jinchun Electric Appliances Company each received a final
anti-dumping duty of 77.75 percent.
 All other Chinese producers and exporters received a final
anti-dumping duty of 174.85 percent.
 The U.S. International Trade Commission has to give final
approval to the duties. That vote is set for August.

 TORONTO, June 28 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar closed
little changed against the U.S. dollar on Monday after trading
in a muted range with few catalysts to spark a move and market
players preferring to wait for top-tier economic data later in
the week.
 The Canadian currency traded in a tight range between
C$1.0321 and C$1.0372 to the greenback, turning lower as
Toronto's main equity market accelerated declines on weakness
in commodities, especially a steep drop in gold prices. [.TO]
 The Canadian dollar finished at C$1.0358 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.54 U.S. cents, a hair higher from Friday's close
at C$1.0359 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.53 U.S. cents.
 The week's key Canadian data, April GDP, is due on
Wednesday, while U.S. nonfarm payrolls data for June is due on
Friday.
 ""The real action should happen towards the end of the
week,"" said John Curran, senior vice president at
CanadianForex.
 ""People still have mixed feelings about the next interest
rate move given the numbers,"" he said.
 The market is now pricing in less of a chance, as measured
by overnight index swaps, that the Bank of Canada will raise
interest rates at its next policy announcement date on July 20.
A recent spate of weaker-than-expected economic data and
evidence of an uneven recovery across the globe have undermined
market confidence in the central bank's dedication to rate
hikes. 
 The currency was slightly firmer at the start of the
session after a relatively calm session overnight following the
weekend G20 summit of world leaders in Toronto that produced
results that were seen as ""nothing particularly
earth-shattering, but solid, steady progress on most key
files,"" BMO Capital Markets said in a note to clients.
 The G20 countries agreed on Sunday to take different paths
to cutting budget deficits and making their banking systems
safer, a reflection of the uneven and fragile economic
recovery. [ID:nN27235152] For more stories on the G20 summit,

 BONDS GAIN AS STOCKS FALL
 Canadian government bond prices perked up as risk sentiment
flowed away from riskier stocks.
 The tenuous economic recovery highlighted at the weekend
summit and a batch of soft recent data have given bonds a shot
in the arm recently, with some market chatter emerging about
the chances of a double-dip recession in the United States.
That would put Canada's economy, which is closely tied to that
of the United States, at risk as well.
 ""In terms of an outright double-dip I'd give it significant
chances given the serious risks we have in Europe especially,
but I wouldn't peg it at more than a 20 percent risk at this
stage,"" Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital
Markets, said during a post-G20 panel with media on Monday.
 ""Clearly if the U.S. went into an outright double dip,
Canada would have a very difficult time avoiding one
ourselves.""
 The two-year government bond  gained 7 Canadian
cents to yield 1.510 percent, while the 10-year bond
 was up 25 Canadian cents to yield 3.168 percent.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2010 05:02PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-IMF chief says would consider yuan for SDR basket," (Adds comments on yuan revaulation, G20, Asia conference)
 WASHINGTON, June 28 (Reuters) - The head of the IMF said on
Monday he would like to consider putting the Chinese yuan into
the basket of currencies that make up the Fund's Special
Drawing Rights ""the sooner the better"", but its value first
needed to be freely determined by the market.
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn told reporters in a news briefing
that he believed there would be more pressure to include yuan,
also known as the renminbi, among SDR currencies as China's
economic clout grows.
 ""This question has to be considered. I think it will be
difficult to include the renminbi before the renminbi really
has a market price and is in one way or the other a floating
currency. But but the sooner, the better,"" he said. ""Because as
time goes by there are more and more reasons to include other
currencies in the SDR basket -- starting with the renminbi.""
 The IMF's Special Drawing Rights, the Fund's internal unit
of account, has often been suggested as a global quasi-reserve
currency alternative to the dollar. Its value is based on a
basket of dollars, euros, yen and sterling.
 China this month said it would resume a policy of greater
exchange rate flexibility for the yuan after keeping it pegged
at about 6.83 to the U.S. dollar for the past two years. The
move is expected to lead to a gradual rise in the yuan's value
against the dollar.
 By Friday, the yuan  had reached a three-year
high of 6.790 to the dollar, but it eased back on Monday to
6.797 after China successfully excluded any mention of the yuan
-- positive or negative -- from the Group of 20 summit
communique over the weekend.
 NO RAPID REVALUATION
 Strauss-Kahn said a inclusion into the SDR basket would
imply that the yuan was fully integrated into the markets, and
the policy shift taken last week was a step in that direction.
 ""I do not expect that things are going to change very
rapidly, he said. ""We still believe, as when we did a general
review of this, that the renminbi is undervalued. But of course
the move, which is starting, will progressively correct this
feature.""
 However, Strauss-Kahn noted that even a strong upward
revaluation of the yuan would not solve all of the world's
trade and financial imbalances.
 ""Of course, the revaluation of the renminbi goes in the
right direction, and we're still pushing for this,"" he said.
""But there are a lot of other sources of imbalances which will
not be addressed only by changing the currency. So the move is
welcome but it will take time for the renminbi to reach its
normal market value.""
 Strauss-Kahn met with reporters ahead of a conference the
IMF and South Korea are is hosting next month in Daejeon, South
Korea, to examine Asia's rapid recovery from the financial
crisis.
 The IMF chief said the conference in part was a bid to
repair damaged relations with Asia caused by harsh terms
imposed by the Fund on a number of Asian countries during the
late 1990s Asian financial crisis.
 Strauss-Kahn, who took charge of the Fund in 2007, said the
fund's mission was to contain the crisis in countries like
South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia and clean up their
financial sectors. That may have helped them through the
current crisis, but it extracted a heavy toll on growth and
hardship for their people.
 ""Looking backward it appears that it probably could have
been done another way and we've learned a lesson from this,""
Strauss-Kahn said. ""The way the Fund is operating today in many
countries including central Europe is probably very different
from the past.""
 In countries like Latvia, Hungary and Pakistan, the Fund is
not trying to fix all of their problems at once, just taking
steps needed to address their crises, he said.
 Turning to the G20 summit in Toronto, Strauss-Kahn
acknowledged the need for differences in fiscal policy among
different countries, but said that did not mean a lack of
consensus in the group.
 He said the G20 had found ""the beginnings"" of consensus on
financial sector reforms and ""want to find a way to agree"" on
common capital standards for banks.
 ""The momentum, the will to work together, to go on
coordinating economic policy, is still very strong and that, I
think, really is the good news,"" he added.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell on Monday,
pressured by bank funding concerns and caution ahead of more
European debt sales this week, while the Swiss franc rallied
after a monetary official said the currency's strength was not
harming the Swiss economy.
 The euro slid under $1.23 as interbank euro lending rates
hit their highest in almost seven months. The single currency's
failure to rise above $1.24 and heavy selling in euro/sterling
added to the downward momentum.
 Banks must repay 442 billion euros ($545.5 billion) to the
European Central Bank on Thursday, leaving a potential
liquidity shortfall in the financial system of over 100 billion
euros.
 ""The list of negatives for the euro continues to grow.
There's never any shortage of reasons to sell it,"" said Brian
Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster,
New Jersey.
 In late trading in New York, the euro slid 0.8 percent to
$1.2275, near a session low of $1.2265 hit on electronic
trading platform EBS and well off an intraday peak of $1.2398.
Declines accelerated after the currency fell below $1.2310/15
and hourly support near $1.2290, which triggered stop losses.
 Analysts at Action Economics said weak intraday euro/dollar
longs have been forced out after the pair moved under 1.2300.
From here, bids are expected into 1.2260-50, they said.
 The Swiss franc hit a record high against the euro and an
eight-week peak versus the U.S. dollar after Swiss National
Bank board member Jean-Pierre Danthine was quoted in the
l'agefi newspaper as saying deflationary risks have disappeared
and Swiss exports have proven to be robust despite a stronger
currency.
 The euro fell more than 1 percent to a record low of 1.3329
francs, according to Reuters data. Danthine's comments came
after the SNB had backed off a pledge to fight excessive
appreciation of the franc earlier this month. The dollar fell
as low as 1.0818 francs and was last down 0.6 percent at 1.0867
francs.
 ""Euro/Swiss franc continues to power lower now that the SNB
has squarely chosen its inflation objective over an exchange
rate intermediary target that led to ballooning domestic
liquidity,"" said Alan Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS
Global Banking & Markets.
 Against sterling, the euro hit a 1 1/2-year low and last
traded down 1.1 percent at 81.25 pence.
 G20, DEBT AUCTIONS
 Financial markets will closely watch debt auctions by
France and Spain later this week after tepid demand for Italy's
sale of 7 billion euros of government bonds on Monday kept
worries about euro zone debt troubles alive.
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Italian,
French and Spanish government bonds rather than euro zone
benchmark German Bunds all widened.
 ""The backdrop (for the euro) still remains fairly negative
as you continue to see pressure in the bond markets,"" said
Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto. ""If you get a very weak bond auction out of Spain, for
example, it could really start to hit confidence.""
 The market showed little reaction to a G20 summit where
leaders agreed to take different paths to cutting budget
deficits, a reflection of the uneven and fragile economic
recovery in many countries.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was
0.5 percent higher at 85.699, holding above last week's low
around 85.09, which was seen as near-term support.
 The latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed currency speculators slightly trimmed bets on
the greenback and went long on the yen in the week to June 22.
Meanwhile, net euro short positions increased.
 Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.2 percent at 89.42
yen, after hitting a five-week low of 89.06 on EBS.

 * World stocks rose on upbeat US data, G20
 * Oil prices fall on eased energy concerns
 * Euro falls broadly on funding tensions in Europe
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - World shares advanced on
Monday after U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected
and oil prices declined as concerns eased about the impact on
supply from a tropical storm in the Atlantic.
 Bankers voiced relief after world leaders abandoned a
global bank levy and eased the timetable for new capital
requirements at a G20 summit in Canada, which posed questions
about the forum's effectiveness. [ID:nLDE65R0I7]
 Investors bought some global equities, especially bank
shares, after members of the U.S. Congress hammered out a
landmark financial regulation package on Friday, removing
uncertainty, and the G20 dropped a 2012 deadline for more
stringent risk-provisioning rules.
 The euro fell broadly on potential funding tensions in
Europe. The Swiss franc hit a record high against the single
currency after comments by a Swiss central bank board member
that its strength was not hurting the country's economy.
 U.S. stocks also gained, rebounding from losses last week,
after data showed consumer spending rose slightly more than
expected in May. Consumer staples companies' shares were among
the top advancers.
 ""This week could be a pretty good one after the retreat we
saw last week. People will continue to focus on data,
particularly the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller home price
indexes tomorrow and U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday,"" said
Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt.
 U.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than expected in
May even as savings touched their highest level in eight
months, pointing to a recovery that remains on solid ground.
Consumer spending is being closely watched to gauge the
strength of the economic recovery after a series of reports
suggested growth is slackening. [ID:nN28253397] 
 A government report on Friday showed consumer spending,
which normally accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic
activity, rose at a 3 percent pace in the January-March
quarter -- slower than the 3.5 percent the government had
estimated last month.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 17.16
points, or 0.17 percent, at 10,160.97. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 1.22 points, or 0.11 percent, at
1,077.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 5.65
points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,229.13.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose
0.4 percent while more risk-sensitive emerging market
counterpart <.MSCIEF> gained 0.5 percent.
 European shares snapped four sessions of losses to close
higher, led by banking shares, with sentiment lifted by upbeat
U.S. consumer spending data. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> index of top shares climbed 1.3 percent to end at
1,026.68 points.
 Barclays , Deutsche Bank  and BNP
Paribas  gained 1.5 percent to 3.6 percent,
benefiting from the G20's decision to adopt a more flexible
timetable for lenders to implement new capital rules.
 Oil  fell to around $78 a barrel after earlier
touching the highest in almost eight weeks, as concern eased
about whether tropical storm Alex would disrupt supply in the
Gulf of Mexico. 
 Over the weekend, Alex became the first named storm of the
2010 Atlantic hurricane season, which forecasters expect to be
active. They said the storm could become a hurricane on Monday
or Tuesday.
 Spot gold  retreated to $1,247.45 an ounce at
midday, down from $1,253.40 in Friday's late New York trading
and off Monday's intraday peak at $1,262.45 as investors took
some profits from bullion's recent run. Wall Street's gains
also took some luster off gold's safe-haven appeal.
 EURO'S SLIDE
 The euro faces downward pressure in coming days, as the
European Central Bank's one-year loans worth 442 billion euros
expired and the currency failed to make headway after a G20
summit.
 Investors favored the Swiss franc, which hit a record high
against the euro and an eight-week peak versus the U.S.
dollar.
 Swiss National Bank board member Jean-Pierre Danthine was
quoted in the l'agefi newspaper as saying deflationary risks
have disappeared, and Swiss exports have proven to be robust
despite a stronger currency. [ID:nWEA7639]
 The euro fell 1.1 percent to a record low 1.3373 franc
 in morning trading in New York. Danthine's comments
followed the SNB's move to back off a pledge to fight
excessive appreciation of the franc earlier this month.
 The euro  was down 0.70 percent at $1.2288 per
dollar.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar  was up 0.07
percent at 89.27.
 Safe-haven U.S. Treasuries rose, pushing benchmark yields
to one-year lows as speculators, emboldened by a recent batch
of subdued economic data, pushed for a break of key technical
resistance levels.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
up 19/32, with the yield at 3.044 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 1/32, with the yield at 0.6289
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was up
24/32, with the yield at 4.025 percent.
 Bonds, investors' choice during weak economic times, have
benefited from poor data going back to May's discouraging jobs
report. The report added bullish momentum to a rally that
began on worries over Europe's fiscal woes.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2010 12:42PM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-BoE's Sentance: Budget doesn't remove rate rise need," (Adds reaction)
 By Sumeet Desai and David Milliken
 LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - Britain's tough budget does not
remove the need to start raising interest rates now, Bank of
England Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance told
Reuters on Monday.
 The former British Airways chief economist shocked markets
last week when it was revealed that he had voted to raise
interest rates by a quarter-point to 0.75 percent, the first
call for an increase by any member in nearly two years.
 In the first interview with an MPC member since the new
government last week announced the harshest budget in a
generation, Sentance said the fiscal plans were much as expected
and did not change his view that it was time to start gradually
withdrawing the extraordinary stimulus now in place.
 ""I don't think it changes my view, partly because the
tightening put forward in the budget is not far off expectations
before the budget,"" he said.
 Sentance said that the policy tightening he wanted should
not be characterised as a hike but was just the start of a
gradual process of reining back the amount of stimulus monetary
policy was providing the economy.
 He said the time was right for tighter monetary policy given
the improvement in the global economy, the turnaround in Britain
itself and the resilience of inflation.
 The Bank of England is charged with keeping inflation at 2
percent but prices have been rising much faster and the CPI rate
is currently running at 3.4 percent.
 Sentance said sterling's weakness was partly to blame. ""If
you look at the G20, we are the weakest currency over that
3-year period in the G20 -- weaker than the Indian rupee, the
Turkish lira and the Argentinean peso, those famous
low-inflation currencies,"" he said.
 ""Part of that decline in sterling may be warranted. But we
also know that the exchange rate is one of the important
channels through which monetary policy affects inflation in the
UK, so we can't put our hand on our hearts and say this is
purely a structural shift.""
 Sterling extended gains after Sentance's comments were
published, hitting a seven-week high against the dollar aboev
$1.51. It also hit an 1-1/2 year high against the euro.
 ""We do not expect Mr Sentance's dissent from the MPC
consensus to prompt a sudden shift to a more hawkish tone,"" said
Simon Hayes, Barclays Capital economist.
 But he added that he would not now rule out a rate hike
before the end of the year.
 
 LONE VOICE?
 Most analysts do not expect the BoE to start raising rates
from their record low of 0.5 percent until the turn of the year
and Sentance would not be drawn on how many other members would
come to share his view.
 But he said commentators may not be focusing on the fact
that there are a range of views on the MPC. Many analysts take
their cue from Governor Mervyn King who has been very dovish of
late.
 King has said monetary policy had to take account of the
sharp fiscal pain to come and Prime Minister David Cameron has
also said he expected monetary policy would support the economy
through the fiscal squeeze.
 However, Sentance said fiscal policy was not the only thing
to look at.
 ""No one single factor should drive monetary policy. So when
we look at fiscal policy, yes that's in the mix, when we look at
the euro area, that's in the mix. But there are other factors,
the state of domestic demand, the state of inflation
expectations,"" he said.
 ""Each member of the Monetary Policy Committee clearly is
judging that on their own account. I have come to the decision
that we should begin to gradually withdraw some of the monetary
stimulus.""
 He said that gradual rate rises would also be beneficial for
the economy as they would prevent the need for big moves later
on.
 ""I think it is desirable over this recovery to have a more
gradual, gradualist approach to tightening policy. Now that
would imply moving in small steps and gradually, because I think
there is a risk if you start tightening sharply you risk
knocking back private sector confidence, which is the last thing
I would want to do.""

 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on
Monday as potential funding tensions in Europe this week
weighed on the currency, while the Swiss franc rallied on the
view its strength was not hurting the Swiss economy.
 The euro faces downward pressure in coming days as banks
must repay 442 billion euros ($545.5 billion) to the European

shortfall in the financial system of over 100 billion euros.

 The currency failed to make headway after the weekend G20

 ""The data will have little impact on a currency market
where all the attention is on the euro crosses,"" said Alan
Ruskin, head of currency strategy at RBS Global Banking &
Markets.
 ""Euro/Swiss franc continues to power lower now that the SNB
has squarely chosen its inflation objective over an exchange
rate intermediary target that led to ballooning domestic
liquidity,"" he added.
 In late morning trading in New York, the euro fell more
than 1 percent to a record low 1.3329 franc ,
according to Reuters data. Danthine's comments came after the
SNB had backed off a pledge to fight excessive appreciation of
the franc earlier this month.
 The single currency slid 0.3 percent to $1.2338 .
 Near-term resistance was seen at $1.2490, the high struck
on June 21, with support forming around Friday's low of
$1.2254. Option barriers were cited around $1.2400, traders
said.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the performance of
the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies,
was 0.1 percent higher at 85.41, holding above last week's low
of 85.09, which was seen as near-term support.
 A fall below that level would take the index to its weakest
since mid-May. Support below that was seen near the 55-day
moving average at 84.80.

 The market showed little reaction to a G20 summit where
leaders agreed to take different paths to cutting budget

 Analysts said U.S. non-farm payrolls data due on Friday
will add more clarity on the state of the world's largest
economy after data last Friday showed U.S. growth in the first
quarter was slower than previously reported. China's PMI data
is due on Thursday.
 ""This week the market will get a glimpse of critical
economic metrics,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency
research at GFT, in New York.
 ""If the news continues to surprise to the downside,
safe-haven flows will likely resume with U.S. dollar and yen
rallying further as enthusiasm for the risk trade fades along
with the hopes to contain deficit spending.""

 * Will seek to distinguish between normal activity and abuse

 (Updates with details, quotes, background)
 By Klaus Lauer
 BERLIN, June 28 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela
Merkel's centre-right coalition wants to put some limits on its
controversial decision to ban naked short-selling, financial
policy experts from the ruling parties told Reuters on Monday.
 The government will not prohibit naked short-selling on
certain day-trading transactions, according to two senior
lawmakers in the parliament's finance committee. 
 Ralph Brinkhaus, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats,
and Bjoern Saenger, a member of the Free Democrat junior
coalition partners, said various changes will be included in a
draft of a law aimed at curtailing financial market speculation.
 ""The coalition wants to differentiate between normal
business activity and abuse,"" Saenger told Reuters.
 The CDU and FDP put forth the following revision: ""The new
draft will take the short-term naked short-selling out of the
banned area as long as the short-selling transaction is
completed by the end of the day when it was initiated (and) the
corresponding shares or debt instruments have been acquired...""
 The Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, is set to vote
on the proposed 12-month ban on naked short-selling on Friday
and the Bundesrat, or upper house, will follow on July 9.
 They said Germany will not prohibit naked short-selling on
transactions completed in a single day under certain conditions.
 They also said that Germany may possibly extend the ban on
naked short-selling on certain assets to 24 months. The Finance
Ministry would have to inform the parliament about any such
extension, they said.
 Last month Germany announced a surprise ban on naked short
sales of euro zone government bonds and related credit default
swaps and shares of the top 10 German financial institutions,
and subsequently agreed to widened the ban. [ID:nLDE6510VL]
 The planned legislation adds to regulations set up last
month in a drive by Merkel's government to financial speculation
it blames for intensifying the euro zone debt crisis.
 Naked short selling -- which Germany had originally banned
only for shares in its biggest banks, euro government bonds and
related credit default swaps (CDS) -- involves selling
securities without owning or borrowing the underlying assets in
the hope of buying them back at a lower price. 
 Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said he expected the
new ban to pass through both houses of parliament by early-July.
 Other proposed rules included in the bill were watered down
at the last minute. Earlier plans that had included an outright
ban on euro currency derivatives were dropped, according to a
copy of the bill obtained by Reuters. 
 Earlier versions of the bill which called for an outright
ban came up against stiff resistance. Critics had warned that it
could have had damaging effects and be hard to implement.
 Berlin's unilateral move last month to impose an immediate
but partial ban on naked short-selling sent shockwaves through
financial markets and ruffled the feathers of some partners.

 By Steven Scheer
 JERUSALEM, June 28 (Reuters) - The Bank of Israel held its
key short-term borrowing rate  at 1.5 percent on
Monday, citing economic jitters stemming from Europe's debt
troubles.
 It was the third straight month the central bank has kept
rates steady after four quarter-point rate increases between
August and late March.
 The shekel  inched up to 3.88 per dollar in trading
after the decision.
 The central bank said that some data have turned negative
after a year of relatively rapid growth. Israel's economy grew
an annualised 3.6 percent in the first quarter and the bank
previously forecast growth of 3.7 percent for all of 2010.
 ""Taking into account the increased uncertainties in the
global economy, and in Europe in particular, and the effect
these have on Israel's economy, the Governor (Stanley Fischer)
has decided to leave the interest rate unchanged this month,""
the central bank said in a statement.
 Some 12 of 17 economists polled by Reuters before the
decision had expected no move. Five others forecast a
quarter-point hike to 1.75 percent.
 ""It was the correct decision,"" said Leader Capital Markets
economist Rafi Gozlan. 
 ""The negative signals in the financial markets definitely
deserved very high weight in this decision. The weakening
momentum in the local economy justifies a wait-and-see stance on
monetary policy.""
 Analysts expect the key rate to reach 2.25 percent by the
end of 2010 and 2.75 percent in the next 12 months. 
 The central bank noted that keeping rates steady again was
consistent with the gradual process of returning the key rate to
a more normal level aimed at positioning inflation within an
official annual inflation target of 1-3 percent while
contributing to the economic recovery.
 It reiterated that the pace of further rate hikes depends on
the inflation environment, economic activity and the monetary
policies of other central banks. Israeli policy remains
expansionary, it added.
 Inflation is expected to continue to moderate to a 2 percent
rate or below in the next coming months from a rate of 3 percent
in May, it said.

 BASEL, Switzerland, June 28 (Reuters) - Iceland's economic
recovery is unlikely to start until the third quarter and the
central bank could cut interest rates again, its governor said
on Monday.
 The North Atlantic island has been picking up the pieces of
its shattered economy following the collapse of its financial
system and currency in late 2008. The economy grew 0.6 percent
in the first quarter from the previous three months.
 ""We at the central bank don't think the recovery has started
yet and we're more expecting the recovery to start in the Q3,""
Mar Gudmundsson told Reuters in an interview.
 ""However, the economy does not seem to be contracting and
seems to be more like on a plateau. We're not confident about
declaring the recovery yet.""
 The central bank cut its key rate to 8.0 percent last week
after taking borrowing costs to a record high of 18 percent and
imposed strict capital controls to protect its currency.
 The crisis also forced the country to take a $10 billion
bailout from the International Monetary Fund and Nordic states,
and it remains in dispute over funds to repay depositors in
failed Icelandic banks in Britain and the Netherlands.
 ""When we set interest rates in the months to come, what we
will be looking at is what has happened to the exchange rate
and inflation, but we will also take into account the possible
near-term prospects of lifting capital controls on outflows,"" he
said.
 ""We've committed not to lift capital controls on outflows
until after the third review of the IMF which hopefully will
take place early in the autumn. We're keeping interest rates
somewhat higher than otherwise. That doesn't mean we cannot
cut.""
 The central bank's next meeting is on Aug. 18.
 Inflation was 7.5 percent year-on-year in May. Gudmundsson
said inflation adjusted for effects from tax increases was lower
at 6.1 percent and this could more than halve into next year.
 ""We're expecting our inflation to reach our target (of 2.5
percent) very early next year if we exclude tax effects,"" he
said.
 The Icelandic crown hit a 15-month high near 155 per euro
 earlier this month and Gudmundsson said there was room
for the undervalued currency to appreciate further. On Monday it
is trading near 157.
 ""In the medium term we see the krona appreciating further.
It's undervalued when taking into account its historical level
and fundamentals like the debt position. 157 (per euro) is still
low in historical terms,"" he said.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc hit a record
high against the euro on Monday, helped by comments from a Swiss
central bank broad member, while the dollar recovered after
faltering in Asia on concerns about U.S. economic recovery.
 Swiss National Bank broad member Jean-Pierre Danthine was
quoted in the l'agefi newspaper as saying deflationary risks
have disappeared and Swiss exports have proven to be robust
despite a stronger currency.
 The market showed little reaction to a G20 leaders' summit
where they agreed to take different paths to cutting budget
deficits, a reflection of the uneven and fragile economic
recovery in many countries.
 ""The market is not taking too many aggressive positions
right now, just waiting for the next chapter of the global

 U.S. non-farm payrolls due on Friday will add more clarity
on the state of the world's largest economy after data showed on
Friday that its growth in the first quarter was slower than
previously reported, while China's PMI data is due on Thursday.
 By 1122 GMT, the euro fell 0.7 percent to 1.3426 franc
after falling to a low of 1.3413. Danthine's comments came
after the SNB had backed off a pledge to fight excessive
appreciation of the franc earlier this month.
 ING's Turner said uncertainty caused by a weaker Romanian
leu also put pressure on euro/swissie. Romania's government said
it would raise value added tax, increasing concerns about the
country's political stability and economic recovery.
 The single currency eased 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade
on Friday at $1.2345. Near-term resistence was seen at $1.2490,
the high struck on June 21, with support forming around Friday's
low of $1.2254.
 Option barriers were cited around $1.2400, traders said.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, drifted
0.1 percent higher to 85.417, holding above last week's low of
85.09, which was seen as near-term support. 
 A fall below that level would take the index to its weakest
since mid-May. Support below that was seen near the 55-day
moving average at 84.80.
 Against the yen, the dollar was at 89.33 yen, not far from a
five-week low of 89.21 hit on Friday after first quarter U.S.
growth data was revised down. Japanese corporate yen demand at
the month-end may also underpinned the yen.

 * Iraq trying to claim place among oil elite
 
 By Aref Mohammed
 UMM QASR, Iraq, June 28 (Reuters) - Iraq's hopes of building
economic prosperity on the back of multibillion-dollar deals to
develop its vast oil reserves have met a major hurdle in a lack
of dock space and an impenetrable bureaucracy at its top port.
 Neglect, under-investment, combined with red tape,
corruption and bureaucracy have left Umm Qasr port, near the oil
hub of Basra, ill-equipped to deal with the demands of oil
majors trying to pour tonnes of equipment into Iraq.
 ""This port is the worst in the Middle East,"" said an agent
working for a foreign company at Umm Qasr as ships queued in the
Gulf and trucks waited in long lines to collect their cargo.
 ""No machinery, no services, no system,"" the agent said,
barely able to disguise his frustration.
 Emerging from decades of war, sanctions, and economic
decline, Iraq is banking on a quadrupling of oil output capacity
to claw its way out of the chaos unleashed after the 2003
U.S.-led invasion.
 But the firms like BP, Royal Dutch Shell and China's CNPC
which are vying to make it happen are struggling just to get the
equipment they need off the boats and through the port to some
of the largest oilfield projects on the planet.
 Iraq sits on the world's third-largest oil reserves and has
signed deals to boost its output capacity to 12 million barrels
per day in seven years, a massive boon for a country struggling
to provide the most basic services to its 30 million people.
 ""We import lots of goods because we can't find all these
materials in Iraq but there are problems with customs and
tariffs. For me it's a nightmare,"" said an executive from one of
the major foreign oil firms that won a contract in Iraq.
 The complaints from foreign oil executives about port
capacity, crumbling roads and creaking infrastructure have
prompted Iraqi oil officials to try to get an agreement from
Kuwait to open a special border crossing for oil companies.
 ""The human and technical capacities of the Iraqi ports
company are insufficient to handle all the work,"" Dhiya Jaafar,
director general of Iraq's state-owned South Oil Co. (SOC), told
Reuters last Friday.
 
 SLIVER OF SHORELINE
 Iraq has only a sliver of shoreline, squeezed in between
Iran and Kuwait, and Umm Qasr is handling 80 percent of Iraq's
imports. Grain imports for Iraq's huge public food ration
programme are a major part of its business.
 Firms importing wheat, sugar and rice complain of heavy
bribes, poor service and high handling costs that make Umm Qasr
one of the most expensive ports in the world for shippers.
 At Rumaila, Iraq's largest producing oilfield, executives,
engineers and drillers are beginning a large overhaul to nearly
triple its 1 million-barrel per day output.
 The project was the first Baghdad signed, with BP and CNPC
taking it on. Oil service company Weatherford International is
already on the ground with 300 staff as one of the firms that
won part of a $500 million deal to drill new wells.
 Ten other oilfield development deals are also coming online.
 The Iraqi authorities are pursuing a number of schemes to
improve the country's port facilities, including modernising the
docks at Umm Qasr and planning a major new $6 billion port at
Fao, at the southernmost tip of the country.
 In the meantime, the state ports authority says it can
really only cope with the grains imports.
 ""At the present time, the port can handle the commercial
trade, but for the needs of the oil companies we will need more
dock space,"" said Captain Fadhil Abd Ali, assistant director
general of Iraq's state ports operator.
 It can take four days to unload a boat carrying 5,000 tonnes
of cargo at Umm Qasr. And prices are high.
 ""The (docking) fees in any world port don't exceed $1,000,
but in Iraq we have to pay $8,000 to the naval agent,"" Emirati
shipper Muhammad al-Suwaidi told Reuters.
 Then come the kickbacks.
 ""Anyone who says he doesn't take bribes is a liar,"" said a
port worker, who declined to be named.

 By Paul Taylor
 PARIS, June 28 (Reuters) - Bankers voiced relief on Monday
after world leaders abandoned a global bank levy and eased the
timetable for new capital requirements at a G20 summit in Canada
which posed questions about the forum's effectiveness.
 Shares climbed in Europe <.FTEU3> and Asia, led by banks,
after the U.S. Congress adopted a landmark financial regulation
package on Friday, removing uncertainty, and the G20 dropped a
2012 deadline for more stringent risk-provisioning rules.
 ""We welcome the fact that the G20 has stepped away from
imposing an arbitrary timeline for the implementation of new
measures and has instead agreed to phase-in requirements
agreements as and when national economic conditions allow,"" the
International Banking Federation said in a statement.
 Leaders of the main developed and emerging economies papered
over differences on the right balance between reviving economic
growth and cutting budget deficits at weekend talks in Toronto,
in what was seen as a setback for U.S. President Barack Obama.
 Unable to muster the unity of the past three crisis-era G20
summits, the leaders fell back on the ""Sinatra doctrine"",
leaving each country to do it ""my way"", move at its own pace and
adopt ""differentiated and tailored"" policies.
 European leaders got what they saw as a green light to
pursue austerity measures they consider essential to restore
market confidence in the euro dented by the Greek fiscal crisis
and wider concerns about high European sovereign debt.
 ""To be honest, it was more than I expected,"" German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said of the G20's non-binding pledge to
halve budget deficits by 2013 and balance budgets from 2016.
 The United States had pressed the Europeans before the
meeting to avoid withdrawing economic stimulus measures
prematurely and urged countries with current account surpluses
such as Germany to boost domestic demand.
 ""The positive outcome is that the European consolidation
programmes, which are moderate and appropriate given the
confidence crisis in Europe, have been endorsed and accepted by
others at the G20 level,"" Michael Heise, chief economist of
Europe's biggest insurer Allianz , told Reuters.
 The world's central bankers called on Monday for early and
resolute steps to cut deficits, warning that global recovery
could be derailed by surging interest rates unless industrial
economies take determined action to reduce debt.
 ""High and rising levels of public debt imply significant
risks for the global economy,"" the Basel-based Bank for
International Settlements said in a report.

 FRANCE NEXT
 France is likely to be the next European state to announce
deficit-cutting steps this week, with the cabinet due to approve
measures on Wednesday to curb public spending, and further cuts
to be spelled out in September in a tough 2011 budget.
 ""We have an untouchable goal to reduce the deficit level by
two points from 8 percent to 6 percent next year. That's never
been done before,"" Budget Minister Francois Baroin told France 2
television, adding the 2011 budget would be ""the most difficult
in more than 30 years.""
 Meanwhile, several banking sources in Frankfurt said the
European Union is preparing to stress-test more than 100 of the
biggest EU banks in July, representing some 50 percent of each
member state's banking balance sheet.
 EU finance minisers are due to decide next week how many
banks will be tested for their risk resilience, and on what
criteria. EU leaders have agreed the results will be made public
in an effort to restore market confidence.

the premium investors charge to hold French, Belgian, Spanish
and Italian bonds rather than benchmark German bunds rose to the
highest levels since early June. [ID:nLDE65R0J2] [ID:nLDE65R0QH]
The interest rates at which banks lend to each other in euros
also rose. [ID:nEAP000464]
 The European Central Bank said it bought another 4 billion
euros in euro zone government bonds last week, the lowest weekly
sum to date, taking the total to 55 billion since it intervened
on May 10 to halt contagion from Greece's debt crisis.
[ID:nBSD002322]
 The Toronto summit exposed issues that are harder to resolve
when countries loosely united in the G20 are emerging from the
downturn at different speeds and with divergent priorities.
 China avoided a scolding over the weak yuan, which has
fuelled its export boom, by announcing a more flexible foreign
exchange regime a week before the summit and letting its
currency rise by 0.5 percent against the dollar. But Beijing
also refused to let the G20 praise it for the shift, insisting
the issue had no place in international forums. [ID:nLDE65Q0BK]
 On trade liberalisation, the G20 arguably moved backwards,
dropping 2010 as the target date for concluding the long-stalled
Doha round of World Trade Organisation negotiations.
 Opposition from Canada, Japan, Brazil and Australia, whose
banks did not need state bailouts during the crisis, thwarted
European calls for a common tax on banks to shield taxpayers
from the costs of rescuing the financial sector.
 On financial regulation, leaders endorsed a long phase-in
for new Basel III bank capital and liquidity rules, allowing
different speeds for different countries at the risk of
encouraging regulatory arbitrage. [ID:nN27191886]
 ""The outcome makes it more difficult to guarantee stability
on financial markets if all the countries go their own
direction, because you get the possibility of regulatory
arbitrage in markets,"" Heise of Allianz said.

(Adds Caruana comments on G20)
 By Sven Egenter and Ian Chua
 BASEL, Switzerland, June 28 (Reuters) - Governments must
slash budget deficits decisively and central banks should not
wait too long to raise borrowing costs as side effects from
measures prescribed to tackle the global recession may create
the next crisis, the Bank for International Settlements said.
 The global economy as well as financial markets were on the
mend, though the recovery remained fragile in the advanced
economies and in the euro zone the debt crisis put the recovery
at risk, the BIS said in its annual report, published on Monday.
 Global leaders meeting in Toronto agreed to take different
paths for shrinking budget deficits and making banking systems
safer and Washington in particular has warned against cutting
too fast.
 The head of the BIS said there was no time to waste.
 ""We cannot wait for the resumption of strong growth to begin
the process of policy correction,"" BIS general manager Jaime
Caruana told the bank's annual general meeting.
 ""In particular, delaying fiscal policy adjustment would only
risk renewed financial volatility, market disruptions and
funding stress.""
 Caruana later told a news conference that recently announced
fiscal consolidation in some countries together with the
publication of bank stress tests in Europe and the support of
the G20 for regulatory reforms were important steps forward.
 The BIS, which acts as a bank to central banks and a
discussion platform for policymakers, said reforms of the
financial system remained key to prevent further crises.
 Caruana said the benefit of making the financial system more
resilient through tighter regulation outweighed any short-term
growth losses.
 Top central bankers met at the BIS annual meeting June 26-28
in Basel, following the G20 summit where leaders acknowledged
the uneven and fragile economic recovery in many countries.
 In a reversal from the unity of the past three crisis-era
Group of 20 summits, the leaders left room to move at their own
pace and adopt ""differentiated and tailored"" policies.
 But the BIS warned powerful support measures had strong side
effects and said their dangers were starting to emerge.
 ""To put it bluntly, the combination of remaining
vulnerabilities in the financial system and the side effects of
such a long period of intensive care threaten to send
the patient into relapse,"" the BIS report said.
 
 FINE LINE
 The BIS said if the extraordinary measures were kept in
place for too long, policymakers ran the risk of creating
""zombie"" banks or companies, dependent on direct support.
 But it acknowledged the tricky situation for policymakers as
the stakes were high and the risks from capping lifelines too
early loomed large.
 Central banks especially were walking a fine line.
 The banking system was still far from sound, as recent
profits from fixed income and currency trading and the low
interest rate environment were hard to repeat and not all
crisis-related losses may have been booked.
 ""But the longer that policy rates in the major advanced
economies remain low, the larger will be the distortions they
create, both domestically and internationally,"" the BIS said.
 Extremely low real or inflation-adjusted rates altered
investment decisions, postponed the recognition of losses,
increased risk-taking in the search for yield and encouraged
high levels of borrowing, the BIS said.
 In addition, central bankers may underestimate inflation
risks as the crisis may have lowered potential growth rate.
 Markets have pushed back expectations for rate increases in
the United States and in the euro zone in the wake of the Greek
debt crisis, and central bankers urged Europe to solve the
crisis so as not to endanger uneven global recovery.
 Speaking to Reuters on Monday, Jassim Al-Mannai, director
general of the Abu Dhabi-based Arab Monetary Fund, said banks
and policymakers had to beware of fuelling bubbles.
 ""We have to avoid, every economic authority, not to see
bubbles. Our economic policy needs to be prudent, especially
monetary and even fiscal policy,"" he said.
 Challenges for emerging economies were different as they
were recovering strongly and inflation was picking up, the BIS
said.
 ""Some EMEs could rely more on exchange rate flexibility and
on monetary policy tightening,"" the BIS said.
 The Greek debt crisis had highlighted that many governments
had to consolidate their finances immediately as highly indebted
countries would not be able to rescue banks as a buyer of last
resort in another crisis.

forward with final steps to create a regional customs union
regardless whether Belarus joins the entity or not, Russia's
First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on Monday.
 In late May, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to launch the
union on July 1 without Belarus after negotiations with Minsk
stalled when Moscow refused to abolish export duties on the oil.
 ""It will be either a triangle between Russia, Kazakhstan and
Belarus or just Russia and Kazakhstan,"" Shuvalov, Russia's
pointman for the custom's union negotiations, told participants
of the Renaissance Capital investment conference.
 The decision on the number of countries involved will likely
be taken in Kazakh capital of Astana on July 5, he added.
 Belarus has said on numerous occasions that it is ready to
join the entity as well as of July, but said it would not back
down on energy prices.
 Relations between Moscow and Minsk soured further in recent
weeks over gas supply and transit prices to Belarus.
 The new trading bloc is expected to boost Moscow's influence
in the region but could complicate World Trade Organization
(WTO) membership talks, which Russia has been trying to join for
for more than a decade and a half.
 Shuvalov reiterated Moscow's stance that the union was not
going to interfere with Russia's WTO negotiations. The customs
union is based on the fundamental principles of the WTO and
those of the European Union, he said.

 ""There is no explicit indication that a pick-up in lending
is taking place at this stage and that is obviously an
indication that firms remain slightly reluctant to get to banks
and apply for loans and eventually start the investment
process,"" said Silvio Peruzzo at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 M3 money supply, a measure of cash readily available to
spend which the ECB sees as a leading indicator for inflation,
fell 0.2 percent on an annual basis, against expectations of a
0.3 percent rise.
 Also at -0.2 percent, the three-month moving average of M3
growth remains well below the ECB's reference rate of 4.5
percent, above which the bank sees dangers to medium-term price
stability.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - World shares rose after a
four-day retreat on Monday with investors still cautious about
global economic recovery but shrugging off the rather neutral
conclusion to a weekend G20 leaders' summit.
 Wall Street looked set to join in with early gains.
 The Group of 20 leaders meeting in Toronto agreed on Sunday
to take different paths for cutting budget deficits and making
their banking systems safer. [ID:nN18322198]
 Most countries had contrasting priorities, reflecting the
uneven economic recovery across the globe.
 Worries have risen in recent weeks that the recovery is
slowing, underlined on Friday by U.S. growth data that was less
robust that expected. [ID:nTOE65R049]
 This has led to fears that countries such as Germany and
Britain are trying to cut their deficits too soon.
 ""There are some legitimate doubts. Government finances in
most of the mature economies are really in trouble, so we have
to do something about that. But it will probably pressure
growth,"" said Luc Van Hecka, chief economist at KBC Securities.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up
0.3 percent with its more risk-sensitive emerging market
counterpart <.MSCIEF> gaining 0.6 percent.
 The main index suffered four days of losses last week
following a 10-session rally. It is down around 7 percent for
the year-to-date, reflecting the first half's volatility over
economic recovery and the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.
 European shares put in solid gains. The FTSEurofirst 300
<.FTEU3> was up 0.8 percent.
 Banks were among the top risers, in part because the G20
agreed to allow more time for banks to adopt new capital rules.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> slipped half a percent, with
prospects of a stronger yen weakening sentiment because of its
impact on exports.

 DOLLAR CALM
 The dollar edged up after faltering in Asia on concerns
about U.S. economic recovery and the euro remained under
pressure by euro zone debt concerns.
 The market showed little reaction to the G20 summit.
 ""It's mostly a compromise and nothing hugely material,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""The focus this week is on the recovery weakening, which is
taking some upward momentum out of the dollar, most evident
against the yen, as the euro remains hampered by its own
issues.""
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies

 LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Monday
after faltering in Asia on concerns about U.S. economic
recovery, while the euro failed to make headway after a G20
summit failed to set markets alight.
 The market showed little reaction to a Group of 20 leaders'
summit where they agreed to take different paths to cutting
budget deficits, a reflection of the uneven and fragile economic
recovery in many countries.
 ""It's mostly a compromise and nothing hugely material,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""The focus this week is of the recovery weakening, which is
taking some upward momentum out of the dollar, most evident
against the yen, as the euro remains hampered by its own
issues.""
 At 0734 GMT, the euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.2353.
Near-term resistance was seen at $1.2490, the high struck on
June 21, with support forming around Friday's low of $1.2254.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
slightly at 85.441, holding above last week's low of 85.09 which
is seen as near-term support. 
 A fall below 85.09 would take the index to its weakest since
mid-May. Support below that was seen near the 55-day moving
average at 84.80.
 The dollar was at 89.36 yen, not far from a five-week low of
89.21 hit on Friday after first quarter U.S. growth data was
revised down. It lost 1.3 percent last week, the third straight
week of declines.
 A raft of U.S. economic data this week, culminating with
non-farm payrolls figures on Friday, will offer plenty of
evidence about the state of the world's largest economy.
 The dollar got some support in Asia from expectations that
Japanese importers' bids were sitting below 89.00 yen, but
options triggers below 89.00 yen could take it lower, traders
said.
 The latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed currency speculators trimmed bets on the
greenback and went long on the yen in the week to June 22.

 SWISSIE ASCENDANT
 The U.S. currency hit an eight-week low against the Swiss
franc at 1.0895 franc on trading platform EBS, and hovered near
a five-week trough versus the yen.
 Market players feel comfortable about picking up the Swiss
franc as the Swiss National Bank (SNB) backed off a pledge to
fight excessive appreciation of the franc earlier this month.
 SNB board member Jean-Pierre Danthine was quoted as saying
on Monday deflationary risks had largely disappeared in
Switzerland and Swiss exports have proven to be robust despite a
strong Swiss franc.
 Sterling remained above $1.50, hovering near its highest
levels seen since early May struck on Friday.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2010 03:58AM ET</span>",SCENARIOS-Economic impact of Kenya's referendum," By Jeremy Clarke
 NAIROBI, June 28 (Reuters) - Kenya's economic outlook is
mixed but most analysts agree the Aug. 4 constitutional
referendum will affect the economy regardless of its outcome.
While adopting a new charter is widely expected, a grenade
attack at a political rally earlier in the month, killing six,
was a reminder that polls in Kenya are often marred by violence.
 Here are a few scenarios for the nation-wide vote and the
effect each may have on east Africa's largest economy:
 
 THE NEW CONSTITUTION IS PASSED BY VOTERS
 The proposed charter is the centrepiece of the deal signed
to end the violence that followed the 2007 presidential
election, which killed at least 1,300 people, scared off
investors and tourists and sent growth rates plummeting.
 Many traders and analysts say markets would take enormous
confidence from its peaceful passage into law.
 ""It will give a boost to the market because it will be seen
addressing the issues that brought about the post-election
violence,"" said Ignatius Chicha, treasurer at Citi.
 ""It will give a good platform for the economy. Aside just
causing positive local sentiment, I think offshore players will
also look at it very positively. I think it is generally good
for the entire economy,"" Chicha told Reuters.
 Stocks are also seen benefiting.
 ""We are going to see a wide range of stocks doing better
because of the view there are fewer obstacles to keep the market
down,"" said Fred Mueni, managing director at Tsavo Securities.
 ""I think interest rates will come down if the constitution
passes ... we may see the 91-day T-bill reaching 2.0 percent
because people will feel more confident lending the government
more.""
 Traders said it could also shore up Kenya's shilling.
 ""It should spur a stronger shilling because most development
partners that Kenya trades with are in favour of the draft,""
said Chris Muiga, a senior trader at Kenya Commercial Bank.
 But other observers said that the adoption of a new
constitution was now so widely anticipated that the market had
already accounted for it, so its effect would be subdued.
 ""I think in many ways the market has already factored in a
""yes"" vote so if it passes it may have a minimal effect,"" said
Joshua Anene, a trader at Commercial Bank of Africa.
 
 THE NEW CONSTITUTION IS REJECTED BY VOTERS
 The August poll is seen as a test of the uneasy partnership
between President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga,
who are both campaigning across the country for a ""yes"" vote.
 ""Kenya's most powerful politicians back a ""yes"" vote, if it
doesn't pass it will be a crisis of confidence in Kenya's
leadership, which could be very bad for the market,"" Anene said.
 ""In terms of perception, we will essentially be back to the
old constitution and we will be back to the same issues (that
have unsettled the market in the past),"" Chicha said.
 But traders did not see a ""no"" vote having a dramatic
effect, in fact some argued that the possibility of violence was
only there after a ""yes"" vote because they saw the ""no"" campaign
as being more volatile and less likely to react well to a loss.
 ""If it doesn't pass I think the stock market will be
undecided how to react. I don't see a clear direction there,""
said Mueni, who added Safaricom and National Bank of Kenya,
might lose turnover due to foreign perception of risk.
 But Mueni said a view may develop that the government will
struggle to get funding if the constitution and its sweeping
reforms are rejected as donors may then put extra conditions on
loans, which could unsettle investors.
 ""In the long-term the effect (of a ""no"" vote) would probably
not be as bad as most would expect, but in the short-term there
would invariably be some sort of readjustment and realignment of
views -- as a result it will harm the shilling,"" Muiga said.
 THE POLL SPARKS VIOLENCE
 Analysts and traders are unanimous in agreeing that poll
violence is the worst outcome for Kenya's developing economy.
 Following the post-election crisis in 2008, growth fell to
1.6 percent from 7.1 percent in 2007. Tourism was one the
sectors hardest hit as earnings fell 19.4 percent -- after the
best year in its history in 2007 -- as wary travellers stayed
away.
 Any trouble in Kenya will also hit trade and transport with
its land-locked neighbours, especially Rwanda and Uganda.
 ""The violence would open up old wounds, those that came up
last election. It will really freak out investors and as a
result we could see some really adverse movements,"" Muiga said.
 During the post-election crisis, Kenya's shilling fell past
the 70.00 mark, compared with near 63.00 before the poll.
 ""We were in the 60s (before the crisis), this time we are
already in the 80s. The highest I've ever seen the shilling is
83.80, but I think anything that even hints at violence could
take us to 85.00 or 86.00,"" Muiga told Reuters.
 Traders predicted a flight to safer currencies, such as the
dollar, and for stocks to take a battering if violence ensued.
 ""I think those most under threat are these former
parastatals like Safaricom, KenGen, KenyaRe, with some of the
biggest numbers of shareholders,"" Mueni said.
 Observers said small, localised violence was inevitable --
disagreements in bars and public gatherings, for example.
 ""One or two days of violence (in remote parts of the
country) won't necessarily have much of an impact on the market.
But riots in Nairobi, that is very different,"" Anene said.

 (Updates Asian markets, adds Europe, U.S. data)
 By Rujun Shen and Edmund Klamann
 SHANGHAI, June 28 (Reuters) - Most Asian stock markets rose
on Monday, with Europe set to follow, as fears eased that
Washington would draft a harsh bill for regulating the banking
sector and after an unremarkable conclusion to a Group of 20
leaders' summit.
 G20 leaders meeting in Toronto agreed to take their own
paths to ensuring economic growth and left room to move at
their own pace, trying to balance contrasting priorities by
pledging to halve budget deficits by 2013 without stunting
growth.
 The heads of the G20 rich and developing nations also
promised to clamp down on risky behaviour by banks without
restricting lending, and agreed to give banks more time to
adopt tougher rules.
 That followed an historic overhaul of financial regulations
by U.S. lawmakers on Friday, with banks forced to spin off swap
trading operations. Banks will be able to keep most of their
books but will be barred from commodity, equity and some credit
default swaps.
 ""I don't see much substance from G20,"" said Lin Yuhui,
deputy general manager of Jinhui Futures.
 ""Basically it's saying everyone is back to minding their
own business, just like before the crisis,"" Lin said.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose
0.6 percent, with financial shares outperforming. Hong Kong
stocks led the way, rising 0.4 percent.
 Financial bookmakers said Europe's main benchmark indexes
would likely head in the same direction, with spreadbetters
expecting Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC-
40 to open as much as 0.9 percent higher.
 U.S. stock futures were slightly weaker, however.
 Investors will have to weather a welter of U.S. data this
week, including June jobs numbers on Friday, consumer
confidence, pending home sales and some early earnings reports.
 U.S. economic data has been mixed in recent weeks, raising
doubts about the strength of its recovery.

 In Tokyo, the Nikkei share average fell 0.5 percent,
extending falls after closing last week below a key support
level and booking its biggest weekly loss in a month with an
indecisive outcome likely in an upper house poll next month.
 A muted reaction to the G20 meeting didn't help, with the
Japanese market slipping across the board.
 Wall Street had finished almost unchanged on Friday,
although financial stocks had gained on relief the U.S.
financial regulation bill would not inhibit Wall Street profits
as much as had been feared.
 Underlining the less-than-decisive conclusion to the G20
summit, Angel Gurria, head of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, said the ""incipient recovery""
offered policy choices but also made it harder to find common
ground.
 ""When the house was on fire, we all knew what to do: get a
hose,"" Gurria told G20 leaders.
 Asian debt spreads narrowed after widening in the previous
four sessions, with investors encouraged to buy riskier assets
after the G20 leaders committed to cutting budget deficits.
 The Asia ex-Japan iTraxx investment-grade index narrowed 7
basis points (bps) from Friday to 132/134, a Singapore-based
trader said. CHINA MUTES YUAN TALK
 Signalling the difficulties groups such as the G20 have in
addressing matters crucial to global economic imbalances, China
succeeded in having a line praising its decision to move
towards a more flexible exchange rate removed from the G20
communique.
 Beijing maintains debate about the yuan has no place in
international forums, and did not want even a positive
reference to the currency to set a potential precedent for
singling its currency out.
 The People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily mid-point
at 6.7890 against the dollar on Monday, a new post-2005
revaluation high.
 The yuan has risen about 0.5 percent in the past week since
the PBOC said on June 19 that it was unshackling the currency
from its two-year-old peg to the dollar, but gains have been
kept in check by big state-owned banks and any further
appreciation is expected to be glacial.
 Japan's retail sales in May rose 2.8 percent from a year
ago, their slowest annual pace since January, in a sign
consumption driven by government stimulus spending may be
slowing. Retail sales had been surging since the start of the
year, helped by government subsidies for durable goods.
 Investors seeking to cut long positions in favour of the
greenback had the dollar on the defensive on Monday. The euro
held gains as the focus shifted to the sustainability of a U.S.
recovery from euro zone debt worries.
 The dollar index edged up 0.1 percent to 85.43, holding
above last week's low of 85.09. The dollar hovered near a
five-week trough against the yen after data released on Friday
showed U.S. gross domestic product in the first quarter grew
more slowly than expected.
 ""I have a feeling in my bones that perhaps Friday was the
start of the market questioning the viability of the U.S. as
the safe haven,"" said Tim Lovell, an economist at ICAP in
Sydney. Higher commodities and the subdued U.S. dollar helped
the Australian and New dollars. The Australian dollar held firm
at around $0.8750. U.S. crude oil futures briefly rose to their
highest in nearly eight weeks at $79 a barrel as tropical storm
Alex forced Mexico to reduce oil exports and some U.S.
producers to evacuate platforms and curb output.

 * Pressure on Japan rating may mount if plan not followed
(Adds comments)
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, June 28 (Reuters) - Japan's sovereign rating may face
downward pressure over the next couple of years if the government
fails to stick to its plan for fixing public finances, Moody's
Investors Service said on Monday.
 Japan set ambitious targets to rein in its debt last week but
also said these goals could not be met even under its rosiest
growth scenario, the latest sign that the government may have to
push through contentious tax hikes.
 Moody's views Japan's fiscal plan with a ""positive nuance"",
Tom Byrne, senior vice president and Asia regional credit officer
for Moody's, told the Reuters Japan Investment Summit.
 But implementation will be key and lack of fiscal discipline,
or some adverse external shock, such as a double dip in the
global economy could place its credit rating under pressure, said
Byrne, speaking via video conference from Shanghai.
 ""I think the balance of risks, even though we have a stable
outlook, could shift to the negative side if this plan is not
followed,"" he said.
 In May 2009, Moody's raised Japan's domestic-currency debt
rating to Aa2 from Aa3. The outlook for the rating is stable.
 Any sharp rise in debt servicing costs, either because of a
jump in inflation or due to a loss of market confidence in
holding government debt, would also pose a risk to Japan, Byrne
said.
 But these are risks over the medium term and are unlikely to
occur immediately, he added.
 ""We are not expecting a loss of confidence over the next
couple of years or so.""
 Japan's outstanding long-term government debt is over 820
trillion yen ($9.2 trillion), which at 170 percent of GDP is the
highest among major economies.
 Despite this ballooning debt issuance, Japanese government
bond yields have remained low, helped by Japan's large pool of
domestic savings and because domestic investors hold more than 90
percent of JGBs outstanding.
 The 10-year JGB yield hit a seven-year low of 1.125 percent
last week, partly on purchases by banks, which have surplus cash
to invest due to a slowdown in lending.
 While the JGB market still has a strong home bias, this is
not something that should be taken for granted, Byrne said.
 ""That home bias could diminish over the medium-term if the
personal savings rate...continues to decline.""

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2010 12:06AM ET</span>",Reuters Summit-Japan must up foreign investment-securities body," TOKYO, June 28 (Reuters) - More effort must be made to lure
foreign investors back to Japanese stocks, including better
corporate governance and specific, targeted products, the head of
a Japanese investment organisation said on Monday.
 Foreign investment, long a key driver of Japanese market
activity, has fallen off recently after a period of heavy buying
at the end of last year and early this year.
 Prior to the week of June 13 to 18, foreign investors were
net sellers for six straight weeks, dumping a net 1.92 trillion
yen ($21.5 billion) of Japanese stocks.
 ""For investors to be reassured enough to buy Japanese stocks,
the foremost requirement is that the stocks are appealing. But at
the same time having trustworthy corporate governance is also an
extremely important point,"" said Yoichiro Iwama, chairman of the
Japan Securities Investment Advisors Association.
 ""Of course improving Japanese corporate governance will not
solve everything, but there's no question that difficulties
related to this are adding to the market's problems,"" Iwama,
speaking at the Reuters Japan Investment Summit, said.
 At the start of this year, foreign investors were snapping up
Japanese shares at a pace unseen in two years, though much of
this was driven simply by many moving to rebalance portfolios
after being seriously underweight Japan in 2009.
 The situation of the Japan Securities Investment Advisors
Association, the group that Iwama heads, in many ways is typical.
 Though the total assets under management by members of the
organisation totalled 161 trillion yen at the end of March, up
13.5 percent from a year earlier and the first rise in three
years, the assets from foreign investors was a mere 16 trillion
yen, less than half the total three years ago.
 ""This is due to the sustained poor performance of Japanese
shares and also concerns about the fundamental growth for Japan's
economy, given the falling birthrate and ageing society,"" Iwama
said, echoing frequently cited concerns.
 But he added that even under these conditions, companies
providing unusual and specifically targeted products, such as
those highlighting somewhat less well-known firms, could find
opportunities for growth, particularly in Europe.
Iwama, who assumed his current post earlier this month, is
also an adviser to Tokio Marine Asset Management.

 By Rujun Shen and Edmund Klamann
 SHANGHAI, June 28 (Reuters) - Most Asian stock markets rose
on Monday, with Europe set to follow, as fears eased that
Washington would draft a harsh bill for regulating the banking
sector and after an unremarkable conclusion to a Group of 20
leaders' summit.
 G20 leaders meeting in Toronto agreed to take their own
paths to ensuring economic growth and left room to move at
their own pace, trying to balance contrasting priorities by
pledging to halve budget deficits by 2013 without stunting
growth.
 The heads of the G20 rich and developing nations also
promised to clamp down on risky behaviour by banks without
restricting lending, and agreed to give banks more time to
adopt tougher rules. [ID:nN26228300]
 That followed an historic overhaul of financial regulations
by U.S. lawmakers on Friday, with banks forced to spin off swap
trading operations. Banks will be able to keep most of their
books but will be barred from commodity, equity and some credit
default swaps. [ID:nFINREG]
 ""I don't see much substance from G20,"" said Lin Yuhui,
deputy general manager of Jinhui Futures. [ID:nTOE65R01Z]
 ""Basically it's saying everyone is back to minding their
own business, just like before the crisis,"" Lin said.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.6 percent, with financial shares
outperforming. Hong Kong stocks <.HSI> led the way, rising 0.4
percent.
 Financial bookmakers said Europe's main benchmark indexes
would likely head in the same direction, with spreadbetters
expecting Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>, Germany's DAX <.GDAXI>
and France's CAC- 40  to open as much as 0.9 percent
higher. [ID:nLDE65R02A]
 U.S. stock futures <.SPc1> were slightly weaker, however.

week, including June jobs numbers on Friday, consumer

 In Tokyo, the Nikkei share average <.N225> fell 0.5
percent, extending falls after closing last week below a key

with an indecisive outcome likely in an upper house poll next
month.
 A muted reaction to the G20 meeting didn't help, with the
Japanese market slipping across the board. [ID:nTOE65R01P]
 Wall Street <.SPX> had finished almost unchanged on Friday,

 Signalling the difficulties groups such as the G20 have in
addressing matters crucial to global economic imbalances, China
succeeded in having a line praising its decision to move
towards a more flexible exchange rate removed from the G20
communique.
 Beijing maintains debate about the yuan has no place in
international forums, and did not want even a positive
reference to the currency to set a potential precedent for
singling its currency out.
 The People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily mid-point
 at 6.7890 against the dollar on Monday, a new
post-2005 revaluation high.
 The yuan has risen about 0.5 percent in the past week since
the PBOC said on June 19 that it was unshackling the currency
from its two-year-old peg to the dollar, but gains have been
kept in check by big state-owned banks and any further
appreciation is expected to be glacial.
 Japan's retail sales in May rose 2.8 percent from a year
ago, their slowest annual pace since January, in a sign
consumption driven by government stimulus spending may be
slowing. Retail sales had been surging since the start of the
year, helped by government subsidies for durable goods.

 * Aussie firm on rising commodities
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, June 28 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive
on Monday as investors sought to cut long positions built in
favour of the greenback, while the euro held gains as the focus
shifted to the sustainability of a U.S. recovery from the euro
zone debt woes.
 The dollar index barely moved at 85.31, holding above last
week's low of 85.09 that is seen as a near-term support. A fall
below 85.09 would take the index to its weakest since mid-May.
 A sustained move below 85 would see more losses, with initial
support seen near the 55-day moving average at 84.71.
 The U.S. currency hit an eight-week low against the Swiss
franc and hovered near a five-week trough versus the yen after
data released on Friday showed U.S. gross domestic product in the
first quarter grew more slowly than expected..
 ""The dollar index swooned in the face of all this news on
Friday night,"" said Tom Lovell, an economist at ICAP in Sydney.
""I have a feeling in my bones that perhaps Friday was the start
of the market questioning the viability of the U.S. dollar as the
safe haven.""
 The dollar was up 0.2 percent at 89.35 yen, but still not far
from a five-week low of 89.21 hit on Friday. It lost 1.3 percent
last week, the third straight week of declines.
 ""The dollar is getting help in Tokyo trade as traders know
Japanese importers' bids are there below 89.00 yen,"" said a
senior FX trader at a big Japanese bank.
 ""But once the main activity moves to overseas markets, the
greenback could be dragged down by speculative selling in an aim
to hit options triggers below 89.00 yen.""
 Latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed currency speculators trimmed bets on the greenback and
went long on the yen in the week to June 22..
 Against the Swiss franc, the U.S. currency slipped 0.2
percent to 1.0913 franc after falling as low as 1.0895 franc, its
weakest since May 4.
 The pair is now testing a major pivotal area in the 1.0890-98
range, which was a major resistance to the dollar's advance in
February and March, Reuters FX analyst Krishna Kumar said.
 Market players feel comfortable about picking up the Swiss
franc as the Swiss National Bank backed off a pledge to fight
excessive appreciation of the franc earlier this month.
 The U.S. GDP numbers came after some weaker-than-expected
housing numbers and a dovish Federal Reserve, all of which drove
U.S. Treasury yields lower and prompted investors to reassess
their dollar positions.
 The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.2381, having gained
nearly 0.5 percent on Friday. And while the dollar's drop was
helping the euro, funding issues in the euro zone were seen
likely to cap gains.
 Near-term resistance is at $1.2490, the high struck on June
21, with support forming around $1.2254, the low struck on June
25.
 Against the yen, the euro rose 0.2 percent to 110.65 yen.
 Traders said the impact from weekend G20 meeting on the
currency market was muted, with the summit throwing up no major
surprises for investors..
 G20 leaders agreed to take different paths to cut budget
deficits and make their banking systems safer, serving a timely
reminder to investors that global recovery would be uneven and
bumpy.
 Still, high-yielding currencies were supported by improved
risk appetite as commodities and stocks made gains.
 The Australian dollar was up 0.1 percent at $0.8754, having
gained nearly 1 percent on Friday. Traders said there was talk of
stops lined up above $0.8780 with resistance at $0.8788, the
55-day moving average.

 * Tougher tests follow unifying force of recession
 * Austerity bites in Europe, worries others in G20
 * Sarkozy: ""drained and empty but duty to participate""
 By Brian Love and Caren Bohan
 TORONTO, June 27 (Reuters) - Recession made the G20 the
main forum for managing the world economy last year. Now, the
recovery is putting to the test the new sense of common cause
that united rich and developing countries.
 Meeting in Canada at the weekend, leaders from the Group of
20 struggled to maintain the solidarity they showed during the
worst of the downturn last year, when they pumped trillions of
dollars into the economy to prevent an even deeper slump.
 ""When the house was on fire, we all knew what to do: get a
hose,"" said Angel Gurria, head of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, told G20 leaders at the summit.
 ""Today, the incipient recovery offers policy choices and
policy options. While it is good to have choices, it becomes
more difficult to find common ground.""
 That summed up the challenge the G20 faces as the economy
in Asia is roaring ahead but is weaker in the United States and
feeble in Europe.
 Additionally, the industrialised world is deep in debt and
looking for a way out, unlike China and some if not all of the
other emerging market economies around the G20 table.
 The summit in Toronto exposed issues that are harder to
resolve when a lot of countries united under the G20 banner are
emerging from the downturn at different speeds and with
different priorities.
 CHINA AND TRADE
 G20 countries initially wanted to formally welcome China's
new commitment to move towards a more flexible exchange rate.
Many of them hope that will lead to a rise in the value of the
yuan and fairer competition in world trade as a result.
 At China's request, the G20 removed a line on the matter
from the statement issued at the summit. [ID:nLDE65QOBK]
 While Beijing said ahead of the summit that debate about
the yuan had no place in international forums, the tractations
over a line of praise showed just how difficult it remains for
the G20 to address a matter considered key if world leaders are
to tackle global economic balances in the longer term.
 On free trade, the G20 if anything backpedalled on pledges
to press for a multilateral commitment to liberalisation under
the long-stalled Doha round negotiations.
 Last year, the G20 leaders committed in their Pittsburgh
communique to pressing for a successful conclusion to the Doha
round negotiations by the end of 2010. This time they dropped
the date and set no new one.
 That, according to European Commission President Jose
Manuel Barroso, injected a dose of realism into the communique,
given that the divisions over the trade round has prevented a
deal for the best part of a decade. But tensions between the
United States and China have bobbed back to the surface too.
 The U.S. and Chinese ambassadors have traded blame this
week at the World Trade Organization over the Doha stalemate.
 President Barack Obama told G20 leaders over lunch on
Sunday that the Doha proposals as they stood now were not good
enough and would need to be changed significantly, officials
told Reuters. [ID:nN27204585]
 PAIN OF DEBT
 The G20 leaders committed to a halving public deficits over
the next three years as the priority shifts from pump-priming a
recession-engulfed economy to slashing the debt the
industrialised world is saddled with on the way out.
 There too, the different angle G20 countries come from is
clear.
 Washington and Europe sniped ahead of the summit because of
European austerity measures that might stifle the already weak
recovery in Europe. But some emerging market countries in the
G20 were more blunt with their misigivings.
 Europe was ""absolutely wrong,"" Argentine President Cristina
Fernandez told Reuters in an interview in Toronto.
 ""If European countries proceed with their fiscal austerity
plans, the global economic turnaround may slow down,"" said
South Koreaan President Lee Myung-bak, another G20 member.
 From a European perspective, the need to show good on
fiscal consolidation is urgent after Greece had to seek
financial help and euro zone governments were forced to come up
with an emergency funding plan for other countries recently.
 The debt of the advanced economies of the G20 is roughly
three times as large as that of the emerging market members of
the grouping, according to International Monetary Fund data.
 ""Lack of international coordination is disappointing, but
not as much as a threat (from debt) at this juncture, Marco
Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit bank said.
 G8 NOT ALTERNATIVE
 The problem, analysts say, is that the G20 may be unwiedly,
but the G8, the forum it is supplanting, is no longer
considered representative of a global economy where the balance
of power is shifting rapidly to the likes of China or Brazil.
 ""Part of the problem that exists today among multilateral
institutions is that they tend to reflect a post-World War Two
distribution of international power. And they therefore lack
legitimacy in many quarters of the globe,"" said Charles Kupchan
at the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations.
 ""So then you say, 'well let's fix that' and the way you fix
that is you just put a lot more chairs at the table.""
 Even if getting the G20 to agree on policy is hard, at
least it provides a forum for global coordination.
 White House adviser Ben Rhodes said that for the past year
and a half, the G20 has sought to calibrate ""the fine line""
over how much stimulus to apply and its timing.
 ""Frankly, if you didn't have the G20 to work that through
we'd be a lot worse off,"" Rhodes said.
 Asked about that risk in Toronto, French President Nicolas
Sarkozy vented his frustration at the media's scepticism about
the G20.
 ""As the G20, we represent 85 percent of global GDP. Do you
think that it is not useful that we talk to each other? You
prefer what, that we argue, that there are trade wars or wars
period?"" said Sarkozy, who will host a G20 summit in 2011.
 ""I am always the first to say that sometimes the
discussions are long, to get a paragraph into communique is
exhausting. When I finish these summits, I feel drained and
empty, but it is our duty to participate.""

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2010 06:34PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Shell shuts some Gulf production due to Alex," HOUSTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Shell Oil  has shut
subsea production at its Auger and Brutus platforms in the Gulf
of Mexico because of the threat of Alex, a website posting said
on Sunday.
 A Shell spokesman declined to say how much production was
affected by the decision or whether Auger and Brutus were
completely or partially shut down as the system crossed the
Yucatan Peninsula as a tropical depression Sunday.
 Both Auger and Brutus receive production from remote subsea
wells that were shut because of personnel evacuation and
projections of Alex's possible storm track, Shell's posting
said.
 Some weather models Sunday moved the track a bit farther
north than earlier projections, although most still had the
storm hitting land in eastern Mexico or far south Texas.
 The website posting said Shell would continue evacuations
of personnel from deep water operations in the southwestern
Gulf that began Saturday, bringing another 35 workers to shore
for a total of 430 pulled in to avoid Alex.
 Shell said it was leaving 1,100 workers in place at
installations in the Gulf.
 ""We will continue to monitor this system closely and
respond to further developments,"" the Shell web posting said.
 Other Gulf operators Chevron , Exxon Mobil 
and Anadarko  said they were monitoring the storm but
had not shut production or evacuated personnel as of Sunday
afternoon.
 Shell's website lists Auger's capacity at 101,000 barrels
of oil and 415 million cubic feet of gas per day and Brutus' at
110,000 bpd of oil and 150 Mmcfd of gas, but it was unclear
whether either was currently producing at those levels.
 Shell's Perdido deepwater development is located farther
west and south than Auger and Brutus and appears more in the
likely path of Alex.
 Perdido is about 200 miles (320 km) east of Brownsville,
Texas. Auger is situated 255 miles (410 km) southeast of
Houston and Brutus about 165 miles (266 km) southwest of New
Orleans.

(New throughout with more details)
 By Brian Love and Caren Bohan
 TORONTO, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on
Sunday called for significant changes to the long-delayed Doha
round of world trade talks, telling Group of 20 leaders that
offers on the table were inadequate.
 Obama, who spoke at a lunch with G20 leaders, emphasized
that he remained committed to the World Trade Organization's
Doha round and was not trying to start it from scratch,
according to sources who heard the remarks.
 The United States and China, at diplomat level, have traded
barbs over the Doha stalemate in recent days.
 China's ambassador to the WTO in Geneva accused the United
States on Sunday of effectively asking for the Doha round to be
started anew with its demands.
 Obama told the private leaders' lunch on Sunday ""he wants
to build on the work that's been done but that the current
offers on the table are inadequate,"" said one G20 source.
 ""The ultimate point is that the deal doesn't do enough for
the least developed countries. The big winners are the major
emerging economies,"" said the source. The reference was
apparently to fast-growing countries such as China and India.
 Obama said ""we need to think outside the box and not focus
only on agriculture and non-agriculture markets but add other
issues to the agenda like services,"" the source said.
 The WTO launched the Doha round in 2001 and it has been
dogged ever since by differences among member countries. They
have accused one another of not putting enough on the table,
and of seeking too much in return for their own offers.
 In another sign of the bleak prospects for a Doha deal any
time soon, G20 leaders dropped their reference to 2010 as a
target date for completion of the talks and set no new date.
 Several sources, however, said Obama's comments at the
lunch were well received by other leaders.
 OBAMA PUSHES EXPORTS
 Obama has often talked of the need for more export-driven
growth in the U.S. economy and is aiming to double U.S. exports
in the next five years.
 Many U.S. business leaders have been frustrated with what
they view as a lack of emphasis by the Obama administration on
the trade agenda and the president has signaled a new emphasis
on the subject recently.
 On Saturday, he announced he was making a new push to
complete a free trade agreement with South Korea. Following a
meeting last week with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Obama
announced U.S. support for Moscow's bid to join the World Trade
Organization.
 Still, other G20 leaders remained cautious about the
chances of reinvigorating Doha.
 ""Where we are at the moment, we are stuck. We are not
progressing,"" said British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""If we
can find a new dynamic, we can find a way to get these talks
going.""
 South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan told Reuters
in an interview that Doha was ""close to dead.""
 ""To keep talking about reviving it is one thing. To do
something about it is quite another,"" Gordhan said.
 ""The serious danger that the world faces at the moment is
that while Doha lies dormant on the one side, on the other
side, they are either reaching new forms of free-trade
agreements as regions, or bilaterally between economies and
that complicates world trade.""
 Leaders of the rich Group of Eight countries, who met in
Canada on Saturday, said they would push forward on bilateral
and regional trade talks while the WTO's global deal remained
unfinished.

 * Calls for better discipline from OPEC countries
 * Badri sees bigger hurdles for deepwater drilling

(Adds quotes, background)
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, June 27 (Reuters) - OPEC secretary general
Abdullah al-Badri said on Sunday that he was comfortable with
oil prices at their current level and he did not expect
production levels to change between now and October.
 ""Current prices are comfortable at this time,"" al-Badri told
reporters in his Brussels hotel ahead of a meeting on Monday
with EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger.
 The two men are likely to discuss economic growth prospects,
which Badri described as fragile in the West.
 Oil's more than $20 plunge over three weeks last month,
sparked by European debt problems, underscored market volatility
from equities to commodities and the fragile state of global
economic recovery.
 ""Right now we are seeing strong growth in one part of the
world and a sluggish response from advanced countries,"" Badri
said.
 Nevertheless, oil markets are oversupplied, he said, calling
on OPEC members to show more discipline in keeping to their
production targets, having slipped from 80 percent compliance at
one point to around 53 percent today.
 ""When you look at the inventory overhang and floating
storage, about 244 million barrels, that means there is a lot of
oil in the market -- oversupply,"" he said. ""We need more
discipline.""
 But he saw no need to call another OPEC meeting before the
one currently planned for October and no change in production
levels between now and then.
 BP's accident in the Gulf of Mexico threatens to add to the
long-term hurdles facing deepwater oil exploration, but al-Badri
said it should be kept in perspective and the U.S. six month ban
should not be extended. A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday struck
down the moratorium imposed by President Barack Obama's
administration, which has appealed against the decision.
 ""In the long-term maybe we'll see a lot more discipline,
more regulation, difficulties to go for deeper drilling -- and
deeper drilling is another frontier we should really go for with
a lot of potential,"" he said.
 ""I see President Obama in limbo,"" he added. ""He's not
certain there is the regulation to prevent another accident, so
he took that decision. I hope after the six months, he'll
revisit his decision and let things go back to normal.""

(Adds final communique, Obama)
 TORONTO, June 27 (Reuters) - World leaders ditched plans to
welcome Beijing's shift towards greater exchange rate
flexibility at a G20 summit in Toronto on Sunday, highlighting
China's sensitivity over the issue.
 But U.S. President Barack Obama, who has been pressing for
a yuan revaluation to help ease trade disparities, welcomed
Beijing's move and said he believed over time the currency
would appreciate significantly.
 Negotiators had hoped a statement to be signed by the
leaders in Canada would include a line welcoming last week's
announcement that Beijing was ending a de facto peg that had
locked the yuan to the U.S. dollar for nearly two years.
 ""The majority of the members of the G20 welcomed the plans
of the government of China on introducing a floating yuan
rate,"" Andrei Bokarev, a Russian finance ministry official,
told reporters.
 But a phrase saying as much was included in an early draft
communique but dropped from the final version ""at the request
of the Chinese side,"" he said.
 Two officials said the line that had been present on
Saturday had been erased less than 24 hours later. ""China did
not want to be explicitly mentioned, even as a good case,"" one
of the officials said.
 Chinese officials say discussion of its currency has no
place in international forums and President Hu Jintao made no
mention of currency policy in a speech to G20 leaders on
Sunday.
 Instead, he said China recognized it had a critical role to
play in helping to rebalance the global economy but necessary
changes could not happen overnight.
 Many economists argue that the yuan is undervalued by about
20 percent versus the dollar and that a more realistic
valuation is vital to help balance the world economy.
 U.S.-CHINA CONTENTION
 It has become a major point of contention between
Washington and Beijing. U.S. Congress members are pressuring
Obama to get tougher with China, saying the mismatch in trade
is making bad U.S. jobless rates even worse.
 Obama said he believed China's pledge of greater currency
flexibility is serious. ""We didn't expect a 20 percent
revaluation in a week. That would be disruptive to the Chinese
economy. It would be disruptive to the world economy,"" he
said.
 ""We do expect that as more and more market forces come to
bear, that given the enormous surpluses that China has
accumulated, that the RMB is going to go up, and it is going to
go up significantly,"" he said. The yuan is also called the RMB
or renminbi.
 Chinese officials present in Toronto said it was fair for
the G20 to discuss currency issues as a part of a broader
consultation about economic policies. But they insisted that
Beijing alone would determine yuan policy and argued that it
was not the only important part of economic restructuring.
 ""If you only rely on exchange rate reform, it is very
difficult to address trade imbalances or trade frictions,"" Yu
Jianhua, a director-general in the commerce ministry, said.
 U.S.-CHINA TRADE DISPUTE
 In a separate but related development, China's ambassador
to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva told Reuters on
Sunday that excessive demands from the United States explained
why the Doha round of talks on global trade liberalisation,
launched in 2001, were going nowhere.
 ""The U.S. is the sole member who insists that we're still
far away from the conclusion of the round,"" Sun Zhenzyu said.
 ""Their new excessive request on an elevated level of
ambition is in fact equivalent to a restart of the round and a
flagrant deviation from the original negotiation mandates.""

 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 27 (Reuters) - China has dismissed U.S.
comments that Beijing is blocking a new trade agreement, saying
that it was the United States that was stalling progress in the
World Trade Organization's long-running Doha round.
 The angry comments, by China's ambassador to the WTO,
indicate how difficult it now is to bridge the gaps in the Doha
talks, launched in late 2001, because of differences between the
United States and big emerging economies, foremost China.
 ""Everybody knows what the real reason for the deadlock of
the Doha round is and where the main political obstacles come
from,"" Sun Zhenyu told Reuters on Sunday.
 ""The U.S. is the sole member who insists that we're still
far away from the conclusion of the round. Their new excessive
request on an elevated level of ambition is in fact equivalent
to a restart of the round and a flagrant deviation from the
original negotiation mandates.""
 
 WAR OF WORDS
 Frustration on both sides has now boiled over into a public
war of words, making a deal even harder, a fact recognised by
leaders of the G8 countries, who include the United States but
not China, when at their summit in Canada on Saturday they
dropped a commitment to complete Doha this year and simply
renewed a pledge to conclude an agreement.
 Sun was responding to comments by his American counterpart,
Michael Punke, the U.S. ambassador to the WTO.
 Punke told Reuters in an interview on June 24 that the talks
were stuck because of a refusal by China and other big emerging
economies such as Brazil and India to open their markets.
 The United States says that the big emerging countries have
benefited from the global trading system and will also be the
sources of much future growth. They therefore have a duty to
open their markets to create new business opportunities not just
for rich nations but also for other developing countries.
 It says that China, now the world's biggest exporter, has
clearly gained enormously from joining the WTO in 2001, when it
made big cuts in tariffs and opened its markets.
 But Punke said China had not responded to U.S. requests for
detailed one-on-one negotiations, although there were signs of
hope that Brazil and India would take part in talks.
 He said the United States recognised that serious
negotiations involved give and take, indicating that Washington
was ready to pay for new concessions from its partners.
 But Sun said that the United States was trying to reopen
what had been agreed over the past eight years by making new
demands on developing countries to open their markets without
saying what it would give in return.
 ""The blame put on China, Brazil and India is nothing but a
red herring to distract people's attention from the real
problem,"" he said.
 If the United States really wanted to make progress in the
talks, it could address a number of contentious issues, he said.
 It could cut its trade-distorting agricultural subsidies,
especially cotton, from $15 billion, cut ""tariff peaks"" on
sensitive goods that keep out developing country imports, comply
with WTO rulings condemning its controversial method of
calculating anti-dumping duties, known as zeroing, and let in
more temporary workers for services from health to construction.
 Sun said China was negotiating actively in the Doha talks
and under current proposals would cut its agricultural and
industrial tariffs by about 30 percent, as well as opening
several new service sectors to foreign competition.
 China had repeatedly called at the G20 for a Doha deal to
help the world recovery, but a deal had to benefit developing
countries, not the interest of one rich WTO member, he said.

 * BRICs push for more clout at G20, but divided politically
 By Guy Faulconbridge
 TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - The leaders of Russia, India
and China called off a meeting of so-called BRIC countries on
the sidelines of the G20 summit on Saturday after Brazilian
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stayed home to deal with
severe flooding.
 The grouping of Brazil, Russia, India and China accounts
for about 16.5 percent of global gross domestic product and has
been seeking more say in world financial institutions.
 ""There will be no BRIC leaders' meeting as President Lula
was unable to attend because of the situation in Brazil,"" said
a source in one of the BRIC delegations who requested
anonymity.
 The BRIC term was coined by Goldman Sachs economist Jim
O'Neill in 2001 to describe the growing power of the four
emerging market economies, although critics say they have
vastly different and often competing political agendas.
 Goldman's models show China could supplant the United
States as the world's biggest economy by 2027. Under that
scenario, the world's biggest economies in 2050 would be China,
the United States, India, Brazil and Russia.
 In an attempt to the turn the grouping's economic might
into political power, the BRIC countries held their first
official summit in 2009 in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg.
Another summit followed in April in Brasilia.
 China is the biggest player in the BRIC grouping, with an
economy likely to grow to $5.4 trillion this year, more than
the three other members combined, according to IMF data. The
BRIC countries have 43 percent of the world's population.
 Lula is missing the two-day summit of the Group of 20,
which includes the world's rich and and emerging economies,
after the flooding in northeastern Brazil, a political
stronghold for his administration.

 * Will be third state visit hosted by Obama
(Adds background, details)
 TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
has invited Chinese President Hu Jintao for a state visit, a
U.S. official said on Saturday, as the two powers seek to
narrow economic and political differences.
 The date of the state visit, which will be only the third
hosted by Obama since he took office in January 2009, has not
been set, White House adviser Jeffrey Bader told reporters on
the sidelines of a G20 summit in Toronto.
 Hu accepted the invitation, Bader added.
 The announcement came a week after China began to address
one of the disputes that has bedeviled their relationship this
year, ending the yuan's da facto peg to the dollar that had
been in place since mid-2008.
 The United States wants China to allow the yuan to rise
more rapidly to help shrink Washington's trade deficit. U.S.
lawmakers accuse China of keeping its exports artificially
cheap and stealing U.S. jobs.
 Obama told Hu he welcomed China's move toward greater
currency flexibility and noted that Beijing's ""implementation
of it was very important,"" Bader said.
 ""The president stressed the need for balanced and
sustainable growth and the role that China can play in
achieving balanced and sustainable growth,"" he said, adding
that Obama also called for a level playing field on trade.
 Hu also extended a hand of cooperation to Obama in their
meeting, saying China sought a closer relationship with the
United States and that the two had already moved closer.
 ""We also want to strengthen the communication and
coordination with the United States on major regional and
international issues,"" he said.
 CHINA SAYS YUAN DECISION BASED ON OWN NEEDS
 In a separate briefing on the sidelines of the summit,
Chinese officials served up a reminder the world's
third-largest economy resents being pressured to change
policy.
 Zhang Tao, a director-general in the central bank, said
China made the decision to enhance the flexibility of the
yuan's exchange rate for itself, based on its own economic
needs.
 But U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner praised
China's move on the yuan and said its leaders were taking the
right steps in trying to reduce reliance on export-led growth.
 ""If you look at what China is doing, growth in China now is
much more driven by consumption and domestic demand than it has
been in the past,"" he said.
 Even if the Obama administration and Beijing seem to have
put the worse of the currency dispute behind them, other
irritants in their relationship remain acute.
 U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said China's
decision to break off military-to-military contacts this year
could undercut regional stability.
 China broke off the contacts after the Obama administration
notified Congress in January of a plan to sell Taiwan up to
$6.4 billion worth of arms.
 The United States has also criticized China's Internet
censorship, while Beijing has denounced Obama's meeting with
the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader.
 Obama has put a priority on mending fences with China,
which his administration sees as important given Beijing's
increasing economic clout and Washington's desire for its
cooperation on foreign policy issues such as Iran and North
Korea.

 By Alister Bull and Patricia Zengerle
 TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
vowed on Saturday to make a new push to complete a long-stalled
free trade agreement with South Korea, one of the thorniest
issues on his trade agenda.
 Obama, speaking after a meeting with South Korean President
Lee Myung-Bak at the G20 summit in Toronto, said he wanted to
move forward methodically in ironing out remaining issues with
the deal, with everything ready in time for his visit to Seoul
in November for the next Group of 20 leaders meeting.
 The deal has met stern resistance in the U.S. Congress,
where Obama's fellow Democrats control a majority of votes.
 ""I want to make sure that everything is lined up properly
by the time I get to Korea in November, and in a few months
following that, I intend to present it to Congress,"" Obama
said.
 ""It is the right thing to do for our country. It is the
right thing to do for the Koreans. It will strengthen our
commercial ties,"" he said.
 The announcement marked the first time Obama set a deadline
for resolving problems with the agreement the United States and
South Korea signed almost exactly three years ago, on June 30,
2007, when Obama's Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, was
president.
 Lee said he welcomed Obama setting a date for the
agreement.
 Many U.S. lawmakers have complained about the pact's auto
provisions, which they said did too little to tear down South
Korea's ""non-tariff barriers"" to U.S. auto imports. The
reaction to Obama's announcement was guarded.
 'ONE-WAY TRADE'
 ""Congress expects to be consulted actively in these
negotiations, and the date targeted by the President can be met
only if the outstanding issues are fully addressed with
enforceable commitments,"" said House of Representatives Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Sander Levin.
 Levin, a Democrat from the auto manufacturing state of
Michigan, said Korean regulatory and tax barriers had led to
""one way trade"" that hurt U.S. manufacturers and kept American
beef sales out of South Korea.
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said Obama's
announcement was ""great news for America's economy,"" but added
South Korean barriers to U.S. beef ""must be removed.""
 The White House acknowledged there remained issues to be
ironed out and specifically cited cars and U.S. beef.
 Obama opposed the agreement during his 2008 presidential
campaign, but has said in previous meetings with Lee, a close
U.S. ally, that he wanted to work to win approval of the pact.
 ""South Korea has the 14th largest economy in the world, and
our ability to compete in that market is critical to preserving
and supporting new jobs for Americans,"" a senior U.S. official
said. ""This initiative aims to reverse the declining U.S.
market share of Korean imports.""
 The prospect of South Korean agreements with the European
Union, Canada and other countries also means the United States
needs to act to improve its competitive position in the Asian
country, the official said, citing a study showing the United
States stood to lose about $30 billion in exports without a
deal.

 By Jeffrey Hodgson and Caren Bohan
 TORONTO, June 26 (Reuters) - World leaders must focus on
bolstering growth in a global economy still scarred by crisis,
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Saturday as
the heads of the Group of 20 nations gathered in Canada.
 Geithner played down the notion of a rift among leaders
over how quickly to cut budget deficits, saying even European
leaders rushing to tighten spending recognized the importance
of reigniting an uneven global recovery.
 ""We have to make sure that people understand that we are
going to take the steps necessary to bring down our deficits
over time. But we also need to make sure we're growing,"" he
told reporters in Toronto.
 ""That balance is going to differ across countries. But I
think you're going to see a strong commitment again by these
major economies to do what is necessary to make sure that we
are supporting recovery and getting that balance right.""
 The Obama administration worries that hitting the brakes
too abruptly on economic stimulus could risk a repeat of the
mistakes that prolonged the Great Depression in the 1930s.
 ""The scars of this crisis are still with us. So, this
summit must be fundamentally about growth,"" he said.
 Even as U.S. officials warned about cutting stimulus too
quickly, Germany and other European countries fear the threat
of spreading contagion from the sovereign debt crisis in Greece
and want to reassure markets of their commitment to reining in
deficits.
 The differences had been highlighted by recent comments
from U.S. and European officials on economic priorities. But
Geithner said the message from the continent's leaders was
about more than just austerity.
 ""You saw in the statements made by a number of European
leaders today ... you've seen this in the commitment they're
going to make here in Toronto, a basic recognition of the
importance of growth,"" he said.
 PRAISE FOR CHINA SHIFT
 Geithner praised China's recent move to make its currency
more flexible and said its leaders were taking the right steps
in trying to reduce reliance on export-led growth.
 ""If you look at what China is doing, growth in China now is
much more driven by consumption and domestic demand than it has
been in the past,"" he said.
 China announced a week ago it would loosen the peg between
its yuan currency and the dollar, which the United States says
gives Chinese exports an unfair advantage at the expense of
U.S. jobs.
 ""This is an important step toward helping China better meet
its own challenges and providing a more level playing field for
all its trading partners,"" he said of the yuan decision.
 At many recent G20 meetings, China's export-led economy has
been a focus of discussion, with its trading partners concerned
it contributes to imbalances in the world economy. Geithner
said China was not alone in an overreliance on exports for
growth.
 ""Growth started somewhat later in Europe and Japan, is
projected be somewhat slower, and is still excessively
dependent on exports to the rest of the world,"" he said.

 BAGHDAD, June 26 (Reuters) - Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain
al-Shahristani said on Saturday he viewed current oil prices of
between $70 and $80 per barrel as acceptable and balanced, and
likely to endure for the rest of the year.
 ""These prices seem acceptable and balanced in the oil
market and it's expected to continue,"" Shahristani told
reporters in Baghdad when asked if the price range of $70 to
$80 per barrel was likely to persist for the rest of 2010.
 He said the oil producer's group OPEC had spare capacity
and could add output at any time.
 ""We have spare capacity in the OPEC countries to increase
supply if we found there was a market for it but the demand so
far has not picked up as quickly as we hoped and we are waiting
for economic recovery to influence demand,"" he said.
 Oil prices climbed to a seven-week high above $78 per
barrel on Friday on fears a tropical storm could form in the
Caribbean and threaten production in the Gulf of Mexico. But
crude prices fell to below $65 a barrel in mid-May as a
sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe, casting doubt on the
global recovery.
 ""I think the market is balanced, supply and demand are
balanced, and that has been the reason in my view why the
prices have stabilised around $75-80 over the last few months,""
Shahristani said.
 Shahristani, whose country is an OPEC member, said there
had been an economic recovery in the United States.
 But he said most of the growth in oil demand was expected
to come from Asia, driven by China and India, the Middle East
and perhaps Latin America.
 Demand in Europe had stabilised, he said.
 Emerging from years of war, diplomatic isolation and
sanctions, Iraq has struck a series of deals that could make it
the world's second largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia. If
the deals work out, its output capacity could climb to 12
million barrels per day in seven years from 2.5 million bpd
now.

(Adds details, background)
 BAGHDAD, June 26 (Reuters) - The estimated cost of building
four new refineries in Iraq to add some 740,000 barrels per day
of refining capacity is more than $20 billion, Iraqi Oil
Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said on Saturday.
 Shahristani gave the estimate to reporters at a conference
in Baghdad with oil company executives at which Iraq's Oil
Ministry laid out its plans for the new refineries.
 He said the ministry would have a clearer idea about the
eventual cost of the four new refineries after receiving design
and feasibility studies.
 The conference is the first step before inviting companies
to tender for the refineries.
 Iraq has eight oil refineries with a capacity of 659,000
bpd. It produces about 453,000 bpd of refined products and uses
589,000 bpd, according to the OPEC website, although
Shahristani said last year that Iraq had attained
self-sufficiency in refined products.
 Iraq plans to boost its refining capacity to 1.5 million
bpd in the next five years by building the four new refineries
and overhauling existing ones.
 It wants to build one of the new refineries in Nassiriya,
southern Iraq, with a capacity of 300,000 bpd, a second one in
the northern oil city of Kirkuk with a capacity of 150,000 bpd,
a third at Maysan in the south, with 150,000 bpd in capacity,
and the fourth in Kerbala with 140,000 bpd of capacity.
 Years of war, sanctions and underinvestment have ravaged
Iraq's ability to produce enough fuels such as gasoline and
diesel to meet growing domestic requirements, forcing it to buy
imported fuel to plug the gap.
 Baghdad has signed a series of deals with global oil
companies and aims to boost its crude output to 12 million bpd
from 2.5 million bpd in six to seven years.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2010 03:50AM ET</span>",Dubai ruler says will go ahead with all projects-CNN," * All planned Dubai projects to go forward-Sheikh Mohammed
 * UAE will not rejoin Gulf union unless it is profitable
 DUBAI, June 24 (Reuters) - Dubai's ruler said the emirate
would go forward with all development projects within a year in
an interview with CNN broadcast on Friday, after billions of
dollars worth of projects were cancelled in the wake of the
global financial downturn.
 ""Everything we started, we are going to finish. Maybe some
projects that we are thinking of, or in the books, might be
delayed for 6 months, 8 months, 1 year, but the rest is going
forward,"" Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum said.
 The economy of the United Arab Emirates, the world's third
largest oil exporter and to which Dubai belongs, is expected to
see the slowest growth in the Gulf region this year, with banks
heavily exposed to a $23.5 billion restructuring of debt-laden
state conglomerate Dubai World [DBWLD.UL].
 Asked whether Dubai needed additional external support to
proceed with current restructuring, Sheikh Mohammed said: ""I'm
not worried about the company, the company have got the
wealth.""
 Sheikh Mohammed, also vice president and prime minister of
the UAE federation, did not say which company or projects he
was referring to in the transcript provided to Reuters.
 Dubai World reached a deal in May with key banks after a
multi-billion dollar bailout from the UAE's capital and
wealthier emirate, Abu Dhabi, but the remaining creditors still
await the final terms. [ID:nLDE65M19H]
 A unit of another conglomerate, Dubai Holding [DUBAHC.UL]
which is owned by Sheikh Mohammed and that belongs to the
matrix of firms commonly known as Dubai Inc., has said it might
sell assets to deal with its debt after a $6.2 billion loss in
2009. [ID:nLDE65003U]
 The loss increased challenges faced by Dubai Holding to
meet its obligations, estimated at $14.8 billion out of a total
$109 billion owed by the government of Dubai and its entities.
 Sheikh Mohammed also indicated he was not concerned about
economic challenges in the OPEC member country.
 ""No, Dubai and UAE, Abu Dhabi and the rest of the emirates
are fine, you know, we know it is recession, we know it is (a)
challenge and we dealing with it,"" he said.
 The UAE, the second-largest Arab economy, is seen expanding
by 2.1 percent this year after an estimated 1.4 percent
contraction in 2009, lagging behind its regional peers
.
 Sheikh Mohammed also said rejoining a planned Gulf monetary
union was not on the cards. ""The euro is in trouble and we
thought of the Gulf currency and we said, well the UAE said
'not yet' and I think they are right, until we are sure,"" he
said.
 The UAE quit the plan to launch a single currency in the
world's largest crude exporting region last year, after losing
its bid to host a joint central bank to Saudi Arabia.

 * Coalition dynamics could complicate fiscal reform
 * PM Kan may face challenge if party falls short at polls
(Adds details, background)
 By Linda Sieg
 TOKYO, June 26 (Reuters) - Japan's ruling Democratic Party
could well fall short of an outright majority in a July 11
upper house election and may need to find new allies to control
the chamber and smooth policymaking, media reported on
Saturday.
 That would complicate efforts by Prime Minister Naoto Kan
to push ahead with efforts to rein in Japan's huge public debt,
including a possible doubling of the 5 percent sales tax, that
he has put at the heart of his campaign in a risky policy
shift.
 The Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which swept to power
for the first time last year promising to cut waste and focus
spending on consumers, will run the government regardless of
the result of next month's poll because it controls the lower
house.
 But the party needs a majority in the upper chamber to
enact laws and implement policies smoothly.
 A June 24-25 survey by the Asahi newspaper showed the DPJ
could win about 54 of the 121 seats up for grabs in the
242-member upper house, short of the 60 it needs for an
outright majority but in line with a target set by Kan.
 The Nikkei business daily predicted the DPJ could win more
than 54, while the Yomiuri newspaper said it might get about
50.
 All three newspapers said it was up in the air whether the
Democrats and their current tiny ally, the pro-spending
People's New Party (PNP), could get the 56 seats they need to
keep a combined majority together with an affiliated
independent.
 REVOLVING DOOR LEADERS
 Kan, Japan's fifth premier in three years, needs a robust
showing by the Democrats to fend off any post-election
challenge from party rivals, such as powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa,
that could make him the latest of the country's revolving-door
leaders.
 Support for the Democratic-led government and the party has
rebounded since Kan took over from his unpopular and indecisive
predecessor Yukio Hatoyama earlier this month.
 But the government's ratings slipped back to around 50
percent after Kan called for debate on raising the 5 percent
sales tax to help curb a public debt already about twice the
size of the economy, the worst among advanced industrial
nations.
 Kan has said he would seek help from opposition parties if
his coalition falls short, and while several have ruled out a
tie-up, analysts say they could change their tune after the
vote.
 The Asahi newspaper said the small Your Party, formed by
defectors from the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
before its historic ouster last year, could take around nine
seats while the New Komeito, a former LDP ally, might get
around eight seats. The LDP itself looked set to win about 41
seats.
 Your Party leader Yoshimi Watanabe insists the government
should do more to cut waste before tackling a sales tax rise,
while the New Komeito wants drastic tax reform to ensure
revenues to cover the bulging social security costs of an
ageing society.
 The newspapers said the Democrats' erstwhile ally, the PNP,
would have trouble retaining the three seats it has in the
upper house, a result that analysts say might actually help the
Democrats' push for fiscal reform since party leader Shizuka
Kamei is an outspoken advocate of big spending to boost growth.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2010 08:14PM ET</span>",Colombia must learn from Venezuela oil mistakes-execs," * Industry players highlight Andean differences
 * Colombia wants to further develop its booming sector
 By Daniel Wallis
 CARTAGENA, Colombia, June 25 (Reuters) - Colombia should
learn from the mistakes of neighboring Venezuela if it wants to
make the most of booming investment in its crude oil
sector, oil industry executives told a conference on Friday.
 ""Colombia is doing all the right things. Venezuela is doing
all the wrong things,"" Alange Energy President Luis Giusti told
the World Petroleum Council's regional meeting here.
 ""Colombians should be very pleased about what is happening
here.""
 Colombia drew $1.3 billion in financing pledges from energy
companies when it put more than 200 oil blocks up for auction
this week, building on dramatically improved security and new
political and legal stability.
 Giusti, a former executive at Venezuela's state oil company
PDVSA, is one of scores of ex-PDVSA employees who left the
company after President Hugo Chavez came to power. They are now
working in Colombia.
 The business-friendly approach of Latin America's No. 4
crude producer is in sharp contrast to the stance of Chavez's
socialist administration in Venezuela, where output has
stagnated because of the country's efforts in recent years to
nationalize many industries.
 While Colombia hopes to double its reserves from a modest
3.1 billion barrels, OPEC member Venezuela has said its Orinoco
belt alone holds about 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil.
 Caracas signed deals with foreign companies this year to
exploit new heavy crude projects in Orinoco that are slated to
add more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of new production
at a total investment cost of some $80 billion.
 But foreign oil executives have said there is doubt about
when the projects will come online due to loss of expertise in
PDVSA, which has a majority stake in each project, and
political uncertainty about investing in Venezuela.
 ""Processing that extra heavy crude requires a lot of
capital
and equipment, and the climate is not good for that there at
the moment,"" said one analyst who follows the sector and asked
not to be named.
 Chavez fired half of PDVSA's workers in 2003 after a
massive
strike, and in the past four years he has frightened off
potential investors by nationalizing stakes held by majors like
ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp.
 Colombia's current President Alvaro Uribe welcomed foreign
investment, loosening regulations, creating a streamlined
hydrocarbons agency and lowering industry taxes.
 On Friday, president-elect Juan Manuel Santos said the
private sector in Colombia could expect much of the same from
him.
 ""It is clear Colombia is a leader in South America when it
comes to speeding up investment in its petroleum sector,"" said
Randy Gossen, president of the World Petroleum Council.
 Across the border, Venezuela's Orinoco projects could still
be a success if PDVSA makes the most of experienced partners in
the blocks, including Chevron of the United States, Spain's
Repsol and Italy's Eni.
 ""Colombia's crude projects have a learning opportunity, to
look at what the neighbors did wrong,"" said Waldyr Rodriguez, a
senior executive at Argentina's Pluspetrol.

 * Soyoil row forced Argentina to seek out other markets
 * Traders skeptical, await Beijing confirmation
(Adds details on Argentine soy output forecast)
 By Nicolas Misculin
 BUENOS AIRES, June 25 (Reuters) - Argentina has reached an
agreement with China to end the Asian nation's freeze on
Argentine soyoil imports, the government said on Friday, but
some traders were skeptical that the trade dispute had been
resolved.
 ""Thanks to the talks the Argentine government has been
holding with China. soyoil exports to China have been
normalized,"" Pablo Lopez, an agriculture ministry spokesman,
told Reuters.
 Last year, Argentina imposed anti-dumping measures on some
Chinese manufactured goods, prompting China, the world's
largest buyer of soyoil, to halt shipments from Argentina this
past March and impose new import standards on soyoil from the
South American country.
 The spat threatened a key hard currency earner for
Argentina, the leading global exporter of soyoil, and forced
Argentine exporters to look for new markets.
 On Friday, traders said they were waiting for an official
announcement from Beijing.
 ""We've heard rumors, but I'd like to see confirmation from
China's government,"" said one trader, who asked not be named.
 Argentina exported 1.84 million tonnes of soyoil to China
last year, bringing in $1.4 billion and accounting for 77
percent of Chinese soyoil imports.
 Several shipments from Argentina to China that had been
scheduled for April and other months were delayed but not
canceled while the two countries tried to reach a solution.
 ""It's odd that with Argentine soyoil $40 to $50 cheaper
than other countries, not a single Chinese importer is asking
us to load the contracts that we had already agreed upon,""
another trader said.
Argentina is the No. 3 global exporter of soybeans and the
top supplier of soymeal and soyoil.
 A drought brought soybean output down to 32 million tonnes
last season, but plentiful rains have boosted yields. Argentina
and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) expect
2009/10 soy to reach a record 54 million tonnes.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2010 05:30PM ET</span>",CORRECTION - - US piracy concerns loom large over Russia's WTO bid," * US business says no ""free pass"" for Russia on piracy
 * Russia bid affected by U.S. experience with China
 * US waiting for Russia to honor promises made in 2006
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. business groups said
on Friday they hoped President Barack Obama's pledge to help
Russia join the World Trade Organization soon meant Moscow will
finally honor promises it made more than three years ago to
crack down on piracy of American goods.
 ""We all want Russia to be in the WTO, but we don't want to
give them a free pass,"" said Mark Esper, executive vice
president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Intellectual
Property Center. ""This affects (movies, music, books), business
software, pharmaceuticals, you name it.""
 Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at a news
conference on Thursday they would push their negotiators to
finish work on Russia's bid in coming months.
 Russia, the largest economy still outside the rules-based
world trading system, has been trying to join for 17 years.
 Moscow often complains it is being held in the WTO talks to
a higher standard on intellectual property rights enforcement
than earlier entrants, such as China.
 ""And they're right. Everyone feels pretty burned by the
Chinese experience, where nine years later we're still waiting
to see substantial IP enforcement,"" said Pat Mears, director
for international commercial affairs at the National
Association of Manufacturers.
 To address those concerns, Russia promised the United
States in a 2006 agreement to take a number of steps to reduce
intellectual property theft, including bringing their domestic
laws into line with international standards and increasing
penalties for violations.
 ""The legal changes haven't yet been made and they've really
been dragging their feet on this,"" Mears said.
 A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk
confirmed that implementing the 2006 pledges was ""a big piece
of the remaining work"" Russia needs to do.
 In addition to making the necessary legislative changes,
Russia must also improve its enforcement of intellectual
property rights, the spokeswoman said.
 On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a national
strategy to protect U.S. intellectual property that included
using trade agreements to achieve that goal and going after
foreign websites that sell pirated music.
 While Biden did not mention Russia by name, the trade
representative's office has put Russia on its ""priority watch
list"" for intellectual property theft for 13 straight years.
 The USTR also complained in an April report that after
Russia shut down one of the world's largest pirate music
website in 2007, a nearly identical one took its place and
continues to operate.
 It would be unrealistic for Washington to expect
""perfection"" from Russia since the United States also has
problems with copyright theft, said Dan Griswold, director of
the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies.
 ""The important question is will the accession agreement be
on commercially meaningfully terms,"" and not just done for
diplomatic or political purposes, Griswold said.
 If Obama is successful in shepherding Russia into the WTO,
he will have to ask Congress to approve ""permanent normal trade
relations,"" or PNTR, with Moscow by removing a Cold War trade
provision known as the Jackson-Vanik provision.
 That conjures memories of an epic battle to win PNTR for
China in 2000. That vote remains controversial 10 years later,
with labor groups and some manufacturers blaming it for
millions of lost U.S. manufacturing jobs.
 The vote on Russia PNTR should not cause as much turmoil
since it does not have a huge pool of cheap labor to compete
against U.S. workers, Griswold said.

* US Q1 growth softer-than-expected, hits shares early
* US financial reform a relief for banks
* Dollar eases, safe-haven flows evaporate
(Updates to U.S. markets' close)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Worries about the fragility
of the global economic recovery capped financial markets on
Friday, with Wall Street shares fighting back amid relief that
banks have dodged draconian regulatory reforms.
 The euro erased losses against the dollar and hit a
session high, buoyed by stocks' slim comeback and a commodity
rally that lifted the price of oil to a seven-week high. That
helped the euro fight off earlier weakness amid concerns about
fiscal strains in Europe.
 Earlier, a report that showed U.S. first-quarter growth
slower than first estimated had prompted safe-haven flows into
the dollar. But consumer sentiment in the United States rose,
providing limited support for Wall Street stocks and
ultimately reversing the bid for dollars.
 The U.S. data capped a week in which investors have been
pulling back a bit from riskier assets as evidence grew that
economic growth, particularly in the United States, may fall
short of 2010 forecasts.
 ""Overall, we have a modest recovery going on,"" said Paul
Ballew, chief economist at U.S. insurer Nationwide in
Columbus, Ohio. ""The conversation of a double-dip recession is
a bit aggressive. You are getting growth in fits and starts,
rather than an outright contraction.""
 On Wall Street, financial stocks gained as uncertainty
ebbed following an historic agreement to overhaul financial
regulations. Business models were preserved even as provisions
cut into profitability and added layers to regulators.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co  shot up 3.7 percent, while
Bank of America Corp  gained 2.7 percent. The KBW bank
index <.BKX> jumped 2.9 percent.
 ""It is not very different from what investors and we had
come to expect in the last few weeks, with the most onerous
provisions getting watered down,"" analysts at Morgan Keegan
said in a note to clients.
 U.S. lawmakers hammered out the new Wall Street
regulations in the early hours on Friday, though the measure
must still win approval from both chambers of Congress before
U.S. President Barack Obama can sign it into law.
 Optimism for business spending rose as Oracle Corp
, the world's third-largest software maker, posted a
better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong sales of new
products. [ID:nN24168374]. Its stock rose 2 percent to
$22.66.
 G8 leaders meeting on Friday in Canada -- turning into the
G20 on Saturday -- are set to grapple with fears that the
spending cuts and tax increases being promulgated by European
governments to cut debt will hurt the recovery. Meanwhile,
Washington is warning against cutting too far and too fast.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> declined
0.27 percent, heading for a weekly loss of more than 2 percent
and its fourth straight losing session. Its emerging market
counterpart <.MSCIEF> slipped 0.48 percent.
 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> shed
8.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to end at 10,143.81. But the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> rose 3.07 points, or 0.29
percent, to 1,076.76 and the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
advanced 6.06 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,223.48.
 For the week, the Dow fell 2.94 percent, while the S&P 500
slid 3.65 percent and Nasdaq dropped 3.74 percent.
 European shares turned negative after initially bucking
the trend. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> fell 0.7 percent to
end at 1,013.58, a two-week closing low, adding to three
previous days of losses.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> fell 1.9 percent
to finish at 9,737.48, its lowest close in two weeks.
 EURO BOUNCES
 The euro overcame earlier weakness to wipe out losses
against the dollar and hit a session high at $1.2396 as
traders cited a minor comeback in stocks and the rally in
commodities. The euro was last quoted at $1.2379, up 0.37
percent from Thursday's New York close.
 The dollar fell against the yen after the earlier report
of soft U.S. economic growth.
 Earlier in the day, funding concerns in the euro zone had
prompted caution as banks need to repay some 442 billion euros
in one-year loans to the European Central Bank next week.
 The dollar slipped against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
down 0.48 percent at 85.325.
 Against the yen, the dollar  declined 0.30 percent
to 89.27 Japanese yen.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose after the disappointing
report on U.S. economic growth. Benchmark 10-year Treasury
notes  rose 9/32 in price, while yields declined to
3.11 percent from 3.14 percent late Thursday.
 Core euro-zone government bonds struggled to make further
headway after three consecutive days of gains drove futures to
two-week highs. Losses were limited by stocks' weakness.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  for
August delivery settled at a seven-week high at $78,86 a
barrel -- up $2.35, or 3.07 percent, for the day. Oil prices
jumped on concerns that a tropical storm in the Caribbean
might get stronger and head to the Gulf of Mexico, where BP
Plc  is trying to clean up its huge oil spill.
 Spot gold prices  rose $11.05, or 0.89 percent, to
$1,255.10 an ounce.

 NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro and commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian
dollar on Friday as investors felt more comfortable buying
riskier assets after stocks came off lows and commodities
jumped sharply,
 U.S. stocks staged a comeback in the afternoon, while oil
prices shot higher, fueling risk appetite and prompting buying
in the euro and the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand
dollars. These last four currencies have become symbols of risk
appetite in the developed world, moving in tandem with U.S.

 ""Fundamentally, there is no reason for the euro to rise

 Funding issues in the euro zone are still an issue, as
banks need to repay some 442 billion euros in one-year loans to

 In late trading, the euro rose 0.5 percent against the

zone single currency was still down 0.4 percent on the week but
up 0.7 percent for the month of June so far.

according to electronic trading platform EBS. It was the
dollar's fourth straight daily drop against the yen and, at 1.3

 Dollar losses versus the Japanese currency were partly
triggered by data which showed U.S. gross domestic product
growth was slower than previously expected in the first

 ""A bit of a disappointment with this (GDP) report,"" said
Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital

 Meanwhile, traders said a weekend meeting of the Group of

 Analysts say currency issues were unlikely to come to the

 ""On the G20, I don't expect too much, because the big

quarter. For more see [ID:nN25111163].
 ""A bit of a disappointment with this (GDP) report,"" said

and with the recent slew of soft data from the U.S., it
actually supports this week's FOMC cautious statement.""
 The Australian dollar rose 1.0 percent versus the greenback
 to US$0.8756 while the New Zealand currency also
gained 1.0 percent to US$0.7154 . The Canadian dollar
was also up, pushing the U.S. dollar down 0.9 percent to
C$1.0354 .
 Meanwhile, traders said a weekend meeting of the Group of
20 rich and developing nations is unlikely to produce any
surprises.
 Analysts say currency issues were unlikely to come to the
fore as China took steps last week to de-peg its currency.
 ""On the G20, I don't expect too much, because the big
announcement already happened last week with China saying it
would let its currency strengthen a bit,"" said John Doyle,
senior currency strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2010 01:22PM ET</span>",FX OUTLOOK-Uncertainty to keep investors cautious," By Steven C. Johnson
 NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Unanswered questions about
the U.S. economy, China's exchange rate and Europe's debt woes
are likely to keep currency traders cautious next week, a
development that should favor the dollar over the euro.
 For investors able to take a longer view, however, the best
buying opportunities are likely to involve currencies such as
those of Australia and Canada, which boast commodity riches,
low debt burdens, policy flexibility and close links with
fast-growing developing markets.
 Analysts expect the euro, which neared $1.25  this
week after plumbing a multi-year low beneath $1.19 in early
June, to retreat toward $1.20 in the days ahead as central bank
buying fades and worries about euro zone debt burdens linger.
 ""We think the euro relief rally has come and gone. There's
no momentum left,"" said BNY Mellon strategist Michael Woolfolk.
""Frankly, it demonstrates how few people want to remain long
euros. It's just a question of how short one wants to be.""
 Investors will also keep one eye on China's yuan a week
after Beijing said it would loosen the currency's peg against
the dollar and allow more exchange rate flexibility.
 The yuan's moves since the announcement have been minor,
but Chinese authorities did set the yuan's daily reference rate
-- the mid-point of its daily trading range -- at 6.7896 on
Friday, the highest level since its July 2005 revaluation
.
 ""It's an issue that's going to percolate for some time, as
a policy announcement is simply insufficient for rapidly
changing a grossly undervalued exchange rate,"" said Lawrence
Goodman, president of the New York-based Center for Financial
Stability, a non-profit financial think tank.
 MANAGING THE RECOVERY
 Runaway deficits in several euro zone countries and the
severe spending cuts needed to rein them in have hurt the euro
on the view that the euro zone will grow much more slowly than
the U.S. economy.
 But U.S. data has raised some questions about the strength
of recovery across the Atlantic, with labor and housing in
particular causing concern. The Federal Reserve unnerved
markets this week with dovish remarks on the economic outlook,
which were interpreted by some as meaning record low interest
rates could stay on hold until well into 2011.
 To that end, analysts said next week's U.S. employment,
manufacturing and consumer confidence data would be important.
Economics polled by Reuters expect employers cut 100,000 jobs
in June, reflecting the end of temporary census hiring.
 The immediate impact of soft data would likely be dollar
positive, as anxious investors sell higher-risk currencies and
assets and take refuge in the dollar.
 Uncertainty about the strength of U.S. recovery, though,
may start nipping at the dollar's heels if investors ditch
expectations of tighter U.S. monetary and fiscal policy.
 SOVEREIGN BALANCE SHEETS
 Debate about how quickly countries should move away from
emergency stimulus spending and toward fiscal and monetary
belt-tightening was also dominating a G20 summit in Toronto.
 The United States has warned against implementing austerity
plans too quickly, while Germany says such moves are needed
urgently.
 ""The divergence in opinion is not entirely irrelevant to
foreign exchange markets,"" said Credit Agricole strategist
Daragh Maher. He noted that sterling rallied sharply against
the euro and dollar this week after Britain's government
announced its most austere budget in a generation, convincing
investors it was serious about cutting its deficit.
 It is in this area, some analysts say, that smaller
currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars look
especially attractive, as both those economies are growing and
have much more favorable fiscal positions than do the larger
U.S. euro zone and Japanese economies.
 Goodman said countries with ""fiscal space,"" or the ability
to expand public spending efforts if needed, should prove the
most attractive buying opportunities. These include currencies
from Australia, Canada, Russia, Chile and Singapore.
 Countries already laboring under high debt burdens and with
less room to increase spending are less attractive.
 ""Now more than ever,"" he said, ""balance sheets matter for
currencies.""

(Updates U.S. trading)
 By Al Yoon
 NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - Worries about the fragility
of the global economic recovery drained strength from
financial markets on Friday, with Wall Street taking an
agreement on regulatory reform in stride as lawmakers eased
off some draconian rules.
 The euro erased losses against the dollar and hit a
session high, lifted by a slight comeback in stocks and a
rally in commodities. That helped the euro fight off earlier
weakness amid concerns of fiscal strains in Europe.
 Earlier, a report that showed U.S. first-quarter growth
slower than first estimated had prompted safe-haven flows into
the dollar. But consumer sentiment in the United States rose,
providing limited support for Wall Street stocks and
ultimately reversing the bid for dollars.
 The U.S. data capped a week in which investors have been
pulling back a bit from riskier assets as evidence grew that
economic growth, particularly in the United States, may fall
short of 2010 forecasts.
 ""Overall, we have a modest recovery going on,"" said Paul
Ballew, chief economist at U.S. insurer Nationwide in
Columbus, Ohio. ""The conversation of a double-dip recession is
a bit aggressive. You are getting growth in fits and starts,
rather than an outright contraction.""
 On Wall Street, financial stocks gained as uncertainty
ebbed following an historic agreement to overhaul financial
regulations. Business models were preserved even as provisions
cut into profitability and added layers to regulators.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Bank of America Corp
 gained more than 1 percent.
 ""It is not very different from what investors and we had
come to expect in the last few weeks, with the most onerous
provisions getting watered down,"" analysts at Morgan Keegan
said in a note to clients.
 U.S. lawmakers hammered out the new Wall Street
regulations in the early hours on Friday, though the measure
must still win approval from both chambers of Congress before
U.S. President Barack Obama can sign it into law.
 G8 leaders meeting on Friday in Canada -- turning into the
G20 on Saturday -- are set to grapple with fears that the
spending cuts and tax increases being promulgated by European
governments to cut debt will hurt the recovery. Meanwhile,
Washington is warning against cutting too far and too fast.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> declined
0.13 percent, heading for a weekly loss of more than 2 percent
and its fourth straight losing session. Its emerging market
counterpart <.MSCIEF> slipped 0.53 percent.
 In midday trading in New York, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> fell 12.84 points, or 0.13 percent, to
10,139.96.
 But the Standard & Poor's 500 Index<.SPX> edged up 1.97

 European shares turned negative after initially bucking
the trend. The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> fell 0.7 percent to
end at 1,013.58, a two-week closing low, adding to three
previous days of losses.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> fell 1.9 percent
to finish at 9,737.48, its lowest close in two weeks.
 EURO AT SESSION HIGH
 The euro overcame earlier weakness to wipe out losses
against the dollar and hit a session high at $1.2358,
according to trading platform EBS, as traders cited a minor
comeback in stocks and the rally in commodities.
 The dollar fell against the yen after the earlier report
of soft U.S. economic growth.
 Earlier in the session, funding concerns in the euro zone
have prompted caution as banks need to repay some 442 billion
euros in one-year loans to the European Central Bank next
week.
 The dollar slipped against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY>
down 0.26 percent at 85.506.
 Against the yen, the dollar  declined 0.23 percent
to 89.33 Japanese yen.
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose after the disappointing
report on U.S. economic growth. Benchmark 10-year Treasury
notes  rose 8/32 in price, while yields declined to
3.11 percent from 3.14 percent late Thursday.
 Core euro-zone government bonds struggled to make further
headway after three consecutive sessions of gains drove
futures to two-week highs. Losses were limited by stock
weakness.
 In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose
$2.08, or 2.7 percent, to $78.59 per barrel, and spot gold

 * Sources say some EU aid found to be illegal

 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 25 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organisation
report on aid for European planemaker Airbus, expected to
condemn the European Union for illegal subsidies, will be
published on June 30, trade sources said on Friday.
 The 1,000-page report was issued confidentially to the
European Union and United States in March, and sources familiar
with it said at the time a panel of WTO experts had found some
of the aid challenged by the United States was prohibited export
subsidies and must be stopped within 90 days.
 They said the document, the latest stage in a decades-long
transatlantic dispute over the multi-trillion-dollar market for
large passenger aircraft, would back many of the U.S.
complaints.
 The EU is likely to appeal against the ruling, delaying the
point at which it takes force. Brussels says the Airbus findings
are only part of the picture and it is premature for one side to
claim victory.
 The WTO is expected to issue an initial confidential report
to the parties in a countersuit brought by the EU against the
United States over support for Airbus rival Boeing next month.
 Boeing hopes the report on Airbus will stop the EU from
subsidising the new A350 plane, which will compete with the U.S.
company's 787 Dreamliner.
 Boeing and Airbus parent EADS are competing for a $50
billion contract to supply the U.S. Air Force with new tankers.
The EADS offering is based on the Airbus A330, one of the planes
that received aid challenged by the United States.

 NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed against
the euro and fell against the yen on Friday as investors sought
safety on concerns about euro zone fiscal strains and data
showing soft U.S. economic growth.
 Funding issues in the euro zone also prompted caution as
banks need to repay some 442 billion euros in one-year loans to
the European Central Bank next week.
 That was on the back of a U.S. government report that
showed gross domestic product (GDP) growth slower than
previously expected in the first quarter and cuts to estimates
for business and consumer spending..
 Both factors prompted risk aversion. A weekend meeting of

 The euro fell as low as $1.2253, off from the day's high of
$1.2351. Midway through the New York trading session it had
trimmed losses to trade around $1.2295, down 0.3 percent.
 The single currency was on track to fall 1.2 percent
against the dollar on the week, snapping two straight weekly
gains.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.5 percent at 109.84
yen, while it hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc of
1.3468 francs, according to Reuters data and electronic trading
platform EBS.
 The dollar fell to 89.34 yen down 0.2 percent on the day.
It was the fourth straight daily drop of the dollar against the
yen and at 1.3 percent for the week, the third straight week of

 Dollar/yen options barriers at 89 yen and below are likely
to check gains for the Japanese currency in the near-term but
some traders said momentum indicated the yen would eventually

 G20 EYED
 Market players were wary of a lack of consensus at the G20

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2010 10:42AM ET</span>",FACTBOX-Greenland allowed to hunt humpback whales again," June 25 (Reuters) - Greenland recouped the right to hunt
humpback whales on Friday after appealing to the 88-nation
International Whaling Commission (IWC) to respect its ancestral
traditions.
 A worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling remains in
place after talks to replace it with a controlled cull of some
species collapsed this week at the IWC's annual meeting in the
Moroccan port city of Agadir.
 The moratorium has been in place for 24 years but Japan,
Norway and Iceland have kept up whaling and some indigenous
communities can also hunt for small numbers of whales.
 Here are some facts about whales and whaling:
 
 * THE BAN
 -- Commercial whaling was prohibited under a 1986 moratorium
but Japan culls whales for what it says is scientific research,
while Norway and Iceland carry out full commercial whaling. Much
of the whale meat ends up in restaurants and on dinner tables.
 -- The three nations have been pushing for a formal end to
the moratorium, saying stocks of some species have recovered.
Their catches have strained diplomatic ties with many of their
usual allies. Countries including the United States, members of
the European Union, Australia and New Zealand oppose the hunts.
-- Australia filed a complaint against Japan at the world
court in The Hague in May to stop Southern Ocean scientific
whaling. In the filing, Australia said Japan was violating the
International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling by
killing whales for research purposes.
 
 * OVERALL PICTURE
-- Blue whales of the Antarctic, the biggest creature ever
to live on Earth, are at less than 1 percent of their original
abundance despite 40 years of complete protection. Some
populations of whales are recovering but some are not. 
 -- Whaling nations say that stocks of the small minke whale,
the main species caught, are big enough to withstand their
hunts.
 -- The West Pacific grey whale population is the most
endangered in the world. It hovers on the edge of extinction
with just over 100 remaining.
 -- According to the WWF, 31,984 whales have been killed by
whaling between 1986 and 2008. 
 
 * SOME WHALE NUMBERS
 -- Humpback whales currently number around 20,000.
 -- Blue whales number up to 12,000. Before the era of
industrial whaling, it was 200,000-300,000.
 -- Fin whales are the second largest animal in the world
after the blue whale, the fastest swimming of all the large
whales. Their numbers are 85,000; pre-whaling -- 400,000.
 -- Minke whales - There is no estimate of total global
population size, but estimates from parts of the range in the
Northern Hemisphere (totalling in excess of 100,000) show that
it is well above the thresholds for a threatened category.
 -- While declines have been detected or inferred in some
areas, there is no indication that the global population has
dwindled to an extent that would qualify for a threatened
category.
 
 * SOME IWC QUOTAS
 -- Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales
(taken by native people of Alaska and Chukotka) - a total of up
to 280 bowhead whales can be landed in the period 2008-2012,
with no more than 67 whales struck in any year.
 -- Eastern North Pacific gray whales (taken by native people
of Chukotka and Washington State ) - total catch of 620 whales
is allowed for the years 2008-2012.
 -- West Greenland fin whales (taken by Greenlanders) - total
catch of 19 whales is allowed for 2008-2012.
 -- West Greenland common minke whales - taken by
Greenlanders. Total limit of 200 whales is allowed for the years
2008-2012 with an annual review by the Scientific Committee.
 -- West Greenland bowhead whales - taken by Greenlanders. An
annual strike limit of 2 whales is allowed for the years
2008-2012 with an annual review by the Scientific Committee.
 -- East Greenland common minke whales (taken by
Greenlanders) - total catch limit of 12 whales is allowed for
the years 2008-2012.
 -- Humpback whales taken by St Vincent and The Grenadines -
For the seasons 2008-2012 the number of humpback whales to be
taken shall not exceed 20.
 
 NATIONAL QUOTAS
 -- JAPANESE whalers caught about 500 whales in the Antarctic
this season, little more than half the target of 900 after
clashes with environmentalists. It says this is part of research
which is is needed to understand the life cycles of whales.
 -- NORWAY - It has set a quota of 1,286 minke whales for the
current summer season, the highest since Oslo resumed commercial
hunts in 1993. But whalers only caught 484 whales in 2009, well
below a quota of 885. Environmentalists say that demand has
shrivelled.
 -- ICELAND - Resumed commercial hunts in 2006 after a
20-year break. It set a quota of 100 minke whales and 150 fin
whales for 2009.

 * Greenland Says hunting whales necessary for way of life
 * Whale conservationists say such arguments are spurious
 By Tom Pfeiffer
 AGADIR, Morocco, June 25 (Reuters) - Greenland has won back
the right to hunt humpback whales for the first time in a
quarter-century after it threatened to leave the world's top
whaling body if other nations reject its ancestral traditions.
 ""We cannot wait any longer,"" Ane Hansen, Greenland's
Minister for Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture, said just
before the consensus vote by the 88 nations of the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Morocco on Friday.
 ""Greenlanders are whale eaters but our subsistence needs
have been cut down and cut down,"" she told Reuters.
 Greenland's Inuit hunted humpbacks for 4,000 years until
Europeans killing the giant mammals for their oil pushed the
animals to the brink of extinction in the last century.
 The Inuit now hunt limited numbers of fin and bowhead whales
for local consumption under controlled licences. The government
says the meat is sold in local open air markets and the proceeds
distributed among the boat crews.
 It says the revenue is vital to the population of the
world's biggest island, which has few sources of income besides
seafood exports and a subsidy from former coloniser Denmark and
is blanketed in ice for most of the year.
 Some IWC delegates said the argument that Greenlanders needs
to hunt whales to survive was spurious as they enjoy one of the
highest average household incomes in the world.
 Whaling opponents say Greenland's whale hunt is big
business, the meat sold in supermarkets for ten times the price
in traditional markets and whale steaks served in luxury hotels.
 ""Greenland must withdraw its humpback quota request until it
can demonstrate that all currently available whale meat is used
to meet genuine subsistence needs,"" the Whale and Dolphin
Conservation Society said in a statement before the vote.
 IWC scientists say that catching 9 humpback whales per year,
as Greenland was allowed, would not affect a population that has
recovered since a moratorium on commercial whaling began in
1986.
 But some Latin American states objected to Greenland's
request, saying their income from whale watching for tourists
would suffer if fewer humpbacks return to their waters after
their annual Arctic migration.
 They also want pro-whaling nations to stop blocking a plan
for a whaling-free zone in the south Atlantic.
 Greenland's request went through thanks to a last-minute
compromise proposal by the European Union to curb Greenland's
quota for hunting fin whales.

 By Natuza Nery
 TORONTO, June 25 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva will skip the Group of 20 leaders summit
in Toronto this weekend to deal with the aftermath of severe
flooding in northeastern Brazil that has killed 51 people.
 The northeast region is a political stronghold for Lula's
government ahead of presidential elections in October in which
the popular Lula wants Brazilians to elect his former chief of
staff, Dilma Rousseff.
 ""He doesn't want to be away from Brazil at this difficult
moment,"" a source from Brazil's G20 delegation said on Friday.
The government later confirmed that Lula would miss the
summit.
 The Brazilian source said that Lula, whose home state of
Pernambuco is one of those affected by the disaster, had been
shocked by the destruction he saw when flying over flooded
areas on Thursday.
 The G20 is meeting Saturday and Sunday to seek a consensus
on how quickly to shrink government deficits, how best to
strengthen banks so that they can withstand any new downturn,
and how to harmonize financial regulatory reforms.
 Brazil is one of the rising powers among the world's
emerging economies that have helped lead a global recovery from
recession. Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega will
instead represent Brazil at the summit.
 The floods in the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco have
killed at least 51 people and devastated many towns that were
struck by torrents of water from burst river dams. The state of
Alagoas initially said that about 600 people were missing, but
had revised that figure down to 76 by Friday.
 The G20 groups the world's biggest economies and covers
two-thirds of the world's population. It includes Australia,
Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Korea,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey and China in addition to the
big European economies, the United States and Canada.

 By Charles Abbott
 WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Blanche
Lincoln credited common sense for helping forge a compromise on
her proposal to force banks to spin off their swap trading
operations, allowing them to retain the bulk of their books but
bar them trading commodities, equity and credit default swaps.
 The plan was not as sweeping as Lincoln's original proposal
to require banks to spin off their swaps desks, instead
narrowing the focus to those derivatives perceived as riskier
than the interest rate and foreign exchange swaps that make up
nearly 90 percent of the global swaps market.
 But Lincoln upended predictions that her idea would be
scrapped due to broad opposition by Wall Street and allies in
Congress.
 ""Quite frankly, common sense prevailed,"" said Lincoln,
chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, shortly after
House and Senate negotiators agreed on a financial reform
bill.
 ""Our objectives were to get the risky stuff out of banks.
We figured out how to do that,"" said the Arkansas Democrat.
 Lincoln's proposal was one of the major disputes for
negotiators on the financial reform bill.
 In the final hours of overnight talks, Lincoln and Obama
administration officials agreed on a compromise.
Business-friendly Democrats tried to derail the spinoff but
failed during discussions held on the sidelines.
 Under the agreement, banks could continue to handle foreign
exchange, interest rate, gold and silver swaps and to hedge
their own risks. Activity in commodities, agricultural, energy,
equities swaps and credit default swaps that are not traded
through a clearing house would have to move to an affiliate
within two years.
 ""The beneficiaries of the derivatives compromises worked
out in the final stages include banks, clearinghouses, and
financing arms of manufacturers,"" including companies such as
Ford, Deere and Caterpillar, said Martin Fridson, global credit
strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.
 ""On the face of it, the modifications appear reasonable and
aimed at avoiding adverse consequences that are unnecessary in
terms of achieving the legislation's main objectives,"" Fridson
said.
 For a Q&A on the focus on swaps see: [ID:nN07163869]
 ""This is a good middle ground,"" said House Agriculture
Committee chairman Collin Peterson.
 While the Bank for International Settlements puts the total
value of all over-the-counter derivatives is $615 trillion,
that figure includes options, forwards and other derivatives
that are not swaps. When those are removed, the estimated value
of the swaps market in December 2009 was $425 trillion.
 According to the most recent data effective December 2009,
some 82 percent of all defined over-the-counter or OTC swaps
were on interest rates at just over $349 trillion, with another
5.0 percent in foreign exchange and less than 1.0 percent on
equities and commodities.
 Lincoln is expected to face a strong challenge for
re-election this fall from John Boozman, a fifth-term
Republican member of the House. She won nomination for a third
term in early June.
 Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, said the bill ""is truly historic."" It will reduce
risk in financial markets, he said.
""We haven't discussed that,"" Gensler said when asked how the
bill might affect CFTC consideration of position limits on
energy contracts. The bill allows CFTC to set position limits
on physical commodities.
 The reform must still win final approval from both chambers
of Congress before Obama can sign it into law, giving Wall
Street one final chance to deploy its army of lobbyists on
Capitol Hill. Quick approval is expected and the reform could
go to Obama for his signature by July 4.
 Final implementation of the rules also will be a challenge
in the coming year, analysts said.
 ""Regulators have a year to work out implementation, during
which time there will no doubt be aggressive lobbying on the
design of the rules,"" BNP Paribas' Fridson said. ""So financial
services firms may roll back some of the substance of the
legislation through concerted lobbying while Congress and the
public's attention move on to other issues.""

dateline, previous LONDON)
 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - The dollar rose against the
euro and fell against the yen on Friday as investors sought
safety amid ongoing concerns about fiscal strains in the euro
zone and after a report showed soft U.S. economic growth data.
 Funding concerns in the euro zone also prompted caution as
banks need to repay some 442 billion euros in one-year loans to
the European Central Bank next week.
 That's on the back of U.S. government data which showed
domestic economic growth was slower than previously estimated
in the first quarter as estimates of business and consumer
spending were cut..
 Both factors prompted a rise in risk aversion.
 ""A bit of a disappointment with this report,"" said said
Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist, RBC Capital
Markets in Toronto. ""It's on the softer side of expectations
and with the recent slew of soft data from the U.S., it
actually support this week's FOMC cautious statement. It also
supports a risk-off sentiment in the forex markets.""
 The euro fell as low as $1.2253, off from the day's high of
$1.2351. In early morning New York trade it had trimmed losses
to trade around $1.22298, down 0.3 percent.
 The single currency was on track to fall 0.9 percent
against the dollar on the week, snapping two straight weekly
gains.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.5 percent at 109.91
yen, while it hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc of
1.3510 francs.
 The dollar fell to 89.40 yen down 0.1 percent on the day.
Dollar/yen options barriers at 89 yen and below are likely to
check gains for the Japanese currency in the near-term but some
traders said momentum indicated the yen would eventually test
the year's high of 87.95 yen hit on May 6.
 G20 EYED
 Market players were wary of a lack of consensus at the G20
summit with open disagreements about how quickly to shrink
government deficits, how best to strengthen banks so they can
withstand any new downturn, and how to harmonize financial
regulatory reforms.
 U.S. lawmakers hammered out a historic overhaul of
financial regulations as dawn broke over Capitol Hill on
Friday, handing President Barack Obama a major domestic victory
on the eve of a global summit devoted to financial reform..
 Analysts say currency issues were unlikely to come to the
fore as China took steps last week to de-peg its currency.
 ""On the G20, I don't expect too much, because the big
announcement already happened last week wth China saying it
would let its currency strengthen a bit,"" said John Doyle,
senior currency strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 On Friday, China's central bank set the yuan's daily
mid-point at 6.7896 per dollar, the highest level since the
July 2005 revaluation. It meant China has allowed its refe
rence rate to rise 0.6 percent this week. (Additional

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2010 09:14AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Conflicting signals as H2 kicks off," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Investors head into the second
half of this year facing various conflicting signals on the
global economy, which might be unnerving for those who are keen
to recoup equity market losses from the first six months.
 World stocks, measured by MSCI, are down more than 7 percent
since January, leaving many buy-and-hold investors who bought at
the start of the year deep in the red after a bumper 2009
brought a gain of 32 percent.
 Investors may have already priced in known problems such as
the euro zone debt crisis and some weakness in the U.S. economy
-- while they are also trying to deal with known unknowns such
as G20 financial sector reforms and banking regulation.
 Positives are also clear. China's strength, demonstrated in
last week's yuan depeg, and healthy global industry growth point
to a steady if not raging expansion in the economy this year.
 Amid confusion, one factor that may decide the fate of risky
assets would be the second-quarter earnings season, which starts
in earnest in the next few weeks.
 According to Thomson Reuters data, S&P 500 firms are
expected to see their quarterly earnings grow by 26.8 percent in
the second quarter, with expansions seen in all sectors expect
telecoms and utilities.
 The focus would be on financials, especially in the euro
zone, given the impact on banks from a mini credit crunch in May
which triggered a bout of risk aversion.
 Dollar interbank rates -- the cost for banks to borrow from
each other -- hit a 10-month high, while the funding cost in the
commercial paper market also rose in a move similar to the 07-08
credit squeeze which led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
 The euro hit a four-year low below $1.1900 earlier in June,
which would boost sales of European exporters.
 ""Markets are clearly not overvalued and there are some good
opportunities in equities but still we're not paid to take
risks. The risk reward trade-off is not great,"" said Eric Le
Coz, investment strategist at private investment firm Carmignac
Gestion in Paris.
 Carmignac is taking a cautious approach to equity asset
allocation, holding a limited exposure.
 ""The European crisis is not over yet. We've seen a little
bit of inflection in the momentum of the U.S. economic recovery
that puts a little bit of a question mark over whether it's a
self sustainable recovery,"" Le Coz said.
 ""Banks are afraid of their own shadow. We will have some
difficult time ahead.""
 The publication of stress test results of European banks at
the end of July would be also closely watched.
 
 BANKING STRESS
 Markets are also bracing themselves for July 1, when banks
have to pay back 442 billion euros worth of one-year loans
borrowed from the European Central Bank last year, although they
will have the option of switching to shorter-term loans.
 Ahead of the payback, euro-priced interbank lending rates
hit their highest levels in over eight months on Friday.
 Goldman Sachs' risk model shows financials are seen as
substantially more risky than non financials, although the risk
premium of around 130 basis points may still be too low.
 ""We think this is insufficient given the risks of financial
contagion and the risks of more regulation meaning extensive
capital raising, reduced loan growth and lower return on
capital"" it said in a note to clients.
 ""We recommend a short position on domestic European banks.
Even in the U.S. it is difficult to see the banks coming
away unscathed and we think the risk premium placed on
financials should be higher, whereas Asia is likely to be
more insulated.""
 Other unnerving signals that could affect investor sentiment
next week include a tumble in the Baltic Dry Index, which hit
its lowest level since October on Thursday, and the Economic
Cycle Research Institute's weekly leading index that hit a
45-week low last week.
 The less-known U.S. indicator was remarkably accurate in
predicting the latest recession (it peaked around the middle of
2007; the recession officially began in December of that year).
It also foreshadowed the unexpectedly strong 2009 recovery. 
 But all these economic hurdles are working to delay eventual
monetary tightening.
 ""The easy money/tight fiscal policy mix that we expect in
developed markets has tended to be associated with strong equity
market performance,"" Barclays said in a note to clients.
 ""While we are optimistic that markets will bounce back in
the near term, we believe there are constraints on how far the
rally can go... Investors will likely remain cautious and asset
values are unlikely to reach anywhere near the peaks of recent
business cycles.""

 * Ruling casts doubt on future of govt
 * Govt seen having 3-4 months leeway in refinancing
 * No default seen, govt says has alternative plan
 
 By Michael Winfrey
 Economics correspondent, Central Europe and the Balkans
 PRAGUE, June 25 (Reuters) - A ruling by Romania's top court
declaring government-backed pension cuts illegal will delay the
disbursement of 2 billion euros ($2.68 billion) in aid funds and
could strain the country's short-term financing.
 Even if it is expected to put continued pressure on assets
in Romania and fellow aid recipient Hungary, which both have 20
billion euro loans from the European Union and International
Monetary Fund, economists do not expect Bucharest to default on
its debt.
 But the decision does cast doubt over the future of the
government, which squeaked through a no-confidence vote this
month, and will lead to more tension among lawmakers as ruling
parties try to make up for the budgetary savings scuppered by
the court ruling.
 The leu fell 1.1 percent [ID:nLDE65O0CZ] to a seven-month
low against the euro in response and yields on its sovereign
Eurobonds jumped. The November 2010 yield rose 1.2 percent
before falling back. The May 2012 bond jumping half a percent to
5.6 percent [ID:nLDE65O0SE].
 
 AID DISBURSMENT DELAY
 * The IMF has refused to disburse more aid without the
reform package aimed at cutting the budget deficit to 6.8
percent of gross domestic product this year and 4.4 in 2011.
 * The court's decision to declare a law aimed at cutting
pensions by 15 percent unconstitutional will require the entire
austerity package to return to parliament so that the offending
measures are reworked.
 * Prime Minister Emil Boc said the government has a new plan
ready to negotiate with the IMF that will adhere to its deficit
goal. [ID:nBUC003727]
 * Barclays Capital economist Daniel Hewitt said a hike of up
to three percentage points in value-added tax could make up the
difference. The IMF had pushed for such a move.
 But the need to return the package to parliament will delay
a review with the IMF and keep aid suspended, forcing Bucharest
to finance itself in the short term though other means.
 ""The IMF review that was supposed to take place on June 28
will certainly be delayed,"" Hewitt said.
 
 FINANCING PRESSURE
 The Finance Ministry has struggled to finance itself in
markets since the start of May when it first announced its
austerity package.
 * Finance Minister Sebastian Vladescu estimates Romania's
total financing needs in 2010 at 8-8.5 billion euros if the
deficit stays below 7 percent of GDP. 
 According to Reuters CreditViews, Romania must refinance
$9.142 billion in debt over the next 12 months, including 6.233
billion Romanian leu ($1.81 billion) in state treasury bills and
T-bonds and a 700 million euro-denominated bond by end-August.
 * Romanian officials have not released detailed information
on the government's current cash position. But Vladescu said:
""For now, we do not have problems with paying our debt.""
 * Raffaella Tenconi, chief economist at Wood & Co. in
London, said Romania could cover itself over the next few months
and was not at risk of default.
 ""They can survive for a relatively short period of time. The
government tends to have reserves for 3-4 months, depending
whether you looking at RON or foreign currency liabilities,"" she
said. ""We are certainly not talking about Romania being at risk
of default.""
 * But the Finance Ministry has struggled to borrow at levels
it sees as reasonable. It has rejected all bids or sold less
half of what it planned at 7 tenders since May, refusing to sell
at yields higher than 7 percent.
 At the latest auction on Monday, the ministry sold 331
million lei ($97 million) in one-year paper, versus a planned
1.2 billion. The average yield jumped 56 bps to 6.85 percent and
the cut-off yield was at 6.98 percent. [ID:nLDE65K15J]

 GOVERNMENT AT RISK
 * The ruling, the result of an opposition-backed challenge
at the Constitutional Court, will now force the government to
enter another difficult debate in parliament, where it scraped
through in a no-confidence vote on June 15.
 * Although needed to underpin the country's finances, the
belt-tightening moves have drawn criticism from unions and
sparked strikes and protests among hundreds of thousands of
public sector workers slated to lose 25 percent of their wages.
 * ""Political instability will rise significantly which means
the outlook becomes grim for interest rates, the currency, debt
yields,"" said Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc, chief economist at
ING Romania.

 * Sensitive interface between liberalisation and regulation
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 25 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization
will discuss the financial crisis next week to address concerns
by some developing countries that bailouts have distorted global
trade and competition, a senior trade official said on Friday.
 The discussion will also allow trade negotiators looking at
liberalising and opening up markets to learn about the latest
moves in financial regulation, which is not covered by global
trade talks.
 The meeting, in the global trade umpire's committee on trade
in financial services, will be the first time that one of the
WTO's formal bodies has officially discussed the crisis.
 It will not take formal decisions but is likely to inform
the negotiating stance of the WTO's 153 members.
 ""The biggest challenge ... that the crisis has brought into
focus (is) that you can't continue to globalise the market and
liberalise while you continue to regulate exclusively on a
national basis,"" said Hamid Mamdouh, director of the WTO's
services division.
 Trade officials said the presence of global regulators at
the meeting indicated a readiness at least to discuss the way
that regulatory developments could affect liberalisation and
market opening in financial services.
 Trade in financial services can include a bank opening a
branch abroad, or a firm selling financial products from its
home base to customers in another country.
 Mamdouh said the WTO's liberalisation efforts in financial
services concerned only market access and non-discrimination and
had nothing to do with regulation.
 Critics of the WTO say that liberalisation of financial
services promoted under its agreements forces developing
countries to deregulate, opening their markets to destabilising
forms of casino capitalism that they cannot control.
 Mamdouh said the opposite was the case. The current rules on
financial services were in fact negotiated during the Asian
financial crisis of 1997, but Asian countries signed up to it as
part of the solution, seeing liberalisation as a force for
stability that promotes market confidence.
 And Canada, which opened its financial markets under WTO
agreements, largely escaped damage to its banks in the 2008
crisis by retaining strict, non-discriminatory regulation.
 
 TURF SENSITIVITIES
 Nevertheless, the meeting next Tuesday is sensitive as
finance and regulatory officials often do not like trade
negotiators to touch on matters of regulation.
 WTO members will hear presentations on regulatory issues and
financial-sector rescue programmes by officials from the
International Monetary Fund, the G20's Financial Stability Board
and the Bank for International Settlements, WTO documents show.
 Then individual countries will share their own experiences
of how they were affected by the crisis and dealt with it.
 The discussion results from a proposal by India, South
Africa, Argentina and Ecuador to look at the impact of bailouts
of financial institutions on trade in financial services,
particularly the way they affected financial markets in
developing countries.
 Many developing countries complained that the billions of
dollars poured by rich nations into propping up their banks in
the crisis amounted to unfair subsidies breaking WTO rules.
 But the WTO agreements allow governments to take any
measures they consider appropriate when their financial system
is threatened, a waiver known as the ""prudential carve-out"".
 ""There is a legal cover for situations where members might
deviate from their legal commitments and obligations,"" said
Mamdouh.
 The carve-out can be challenged if other WTO members think
it is being abused, but that has never happened so far.
 In any case, developing countries realise that they could
also suffer from the collapse of a financial institution of
systemic importance in a rich country.
 The meeting will also discuss the impact of trade in
financial services on development, at China's request.
 It is part of a week of meetings on services, which will
also include a seminar on the non-life insurance business sought
by the United States, where the International Trade Commission
has conducted a study on market access in the industry.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - The euro fell broadly on Friday
after investors pulled back from riskier assets as share prices
fell, but the market was wary of chasing prices aggressively
ahead of a Group of 20 leaders' summit.
 European shares shed early gains to trade down 0.5 percent
at 1,015.52, while U.S. stock futures were down slightly.
 ""A little bit of risk aversion is creeping in, equity
markets are under pressure,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency
strategist at BNP Paribas. ""We believe the euro is still
vulnerable.""
 Funding concerns in the euro zone also raised some jitters
as banks need to repay some 442 billion euros in one-year loans
to the European Central Bank next week.
 The euro fell as low as $1.2253, off from the day's high of
$1.2351. Stop-loss sales below $1.2300 accelerated declines,
traders said.
 By 1105 GMT, it had trimmed losses to trade around $1.2270,
below where options with a strike price of $1.2300 were set to
expire later in the day, traders said.
 The single currency was on track to fall 1.2 percent against
the dollar on the week, after two previous weeks of gains.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.3 percent at 110.15 yen
, while it hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc of 1.3510
francs.
 
 G20 EYED
 Market players were wary of a lack of consensus at the G20
summit with open disagreements about how quickly to shrink
government deficits, how best to strengthen banks so they can
withstand any new downturn, and how to harmonize financial
regulatory reforms.
 Analysts say currency issues were unlikely to come to the
fore as China took steps last week to de-peg its currency.
 ""It was tactical of China to move ahead of the G20 to rule
out further pressure about its currency,"" said Roberto Mialich,
currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 On Friday, China's central bank set the yuan's daily
mid-point at 6.7896 per dollar, the highest level since the July
2005 revaluation. It meant China has allowed its reference rate
to rise 0.6 percent this week.
 Concerns about sovereign debt and the economic outlook were
likely to weigh on riskier assets, with the yen and Swiss franc
seen benefitting the most going forward, analysts said.
 The dollar, which is also normally seen as a safe haven, may
struggle after the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this week gave a
less optimistic view on the economy and reiterated interest
rates would remain low for an extended period.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.3 percent at 85.990, but remained below the week's high of
86.415.
 The dollar stood flat at 89.69 yen, near a 1-month low of
89.22 yen on trading platform EBS on Thursday.
 Dollar/yen options barriers at 89 yen and below are likely
to check gains for the Japanese currency in the near-term but
some traders said momentum indicated the yen would eventually
test the year's high of 87.95 yen hit on May 6.
 The Australian dollar pared gains to trade down 0.4 percent
at $0.8635, near a support level of $0.8600.

 * SNB survey highlights risks due to euro zone debt worries
 * Report prepared for policy review echoes June 17 statement
 
 By Catherine Bosley
 ZURICH, June 25 (Reuters) - Swiss industry is upbeat for the
months ahead despite worries about a stronger franc currency and
debt problems in the euro zone, the Swiss National Bank said in
its second-quarter bulletin published on Friday.
 The bulletin prepared for the SNB's June 17 meeting echoed
the policy statement, saying deflation risks had largely
disappeared in Switzerland.
 At the meeting, the SNB took a step towards tightening its
extraordinarily loose monetary policy, judging the Alpine
state's recovery robust enough to drop its pledge to intervene
in forex markets. It also revised up its growth outlook for the
year to around 2 percent.
 ""Industry representatives are looking to the immediate
future with confidence,"" the SNB said in the quarterly report.
""Expectations for the next few months point to positive turnover
growth,"" the SNB said.
The bulletin includes a chapter describing the outlook for
the economy by delegates for regional economic relations, who
survey businesses in various sectors and industries.
 ""However, considerable uncertainties persist regarding the
prospects for the European economy, potential exchange rate
movements, and the future interest rate situation,"" the SNB
said.
 The euro zone is Switzerland's largest trading partner.
Investors regard the Swiss franc as a safe haven, and the euro
zone debt crisis has pushed the franc to record highs against
the euro. The franc touched a fresh record against the euro at
1.3510 on Friday. The SNB said there were considerable
discrepancies in how various branches of industry were reacting
to the rallying currency. The strong franc was creating problems
in the tourism sector, while other industries welcome it because
it led to lower purchase prices, the central bank said.
 The SNB also said businesses were expecting a slight rise in
employment.
 Unemployment in Switzerland has already begun to fall,
earlier than some economists had expected. In May the unadjusted
jobless rate fell to 3.8 percent.

 MOSCOW, June 25 (Reuters) - Russia's economy no longer needs
the stimulus of rate cuts and rates may remain on hold for the
next few months, while any rise in inflation may prompt hikes in
reserve requirements, a top central bank official told Reuters.
""On the one hand inflation is still ... easing compared to
last year. On the other hand there is a recovery in the economy,
which is becoming more sturdy -- this relates both to lending
and to industrial output,"" Alexei Ulyukayev, the central bank's
first deputy chairman, said in an interview.
 ""So the situation is no longer such that we must give extra
stimulus to the economy by cutting rates ... The period of rates
being kept at current levels will possibly last for the next few
months. What happens after that, I cannot say.""
 Russia has cut the benchmark refinancing rate by 525 basis
points since April 2009 to a record low of 7.75 percent in a bid
to help the economy recover from its worst recession in 15
years. But in May the central bank signalled a pause in the
easing cycle and analysts now see rates on hold to year-end.
 The next meeting on rates is due on Wednesday June 30.
 While the refi marks the top end of the rates for central
bank operations, the bottom is marked by the overnight deposit
rate, currently at 2.50 percent.
 ""In theory ... we would like the corridor between lending
and deposit rates to be lower,"" Ulyukayev said.
 ""But in the current situation, the reduction of this
corridor would mean that deposit rates should be fairly high,
which would not be very good ... (since it would encourage) the
inflow of short-term capital, the carry trade.""
 Russia's high interest rates have attracted so-called carry
trade investors who borrow in lower-yielding currencies to
invest in high-yielding ones.
 In quotes approved for publication earlier, Ulyukayev
also explained in detail the central bank's FX intervention
mechanism.
 
 ROUBLE VS INFLATION
 The period of stable rouble appreciation is over and the
rouble is now set for a volatile time without a clear trend in
either direction, Ulyukayev said, reiterating previous comments
and forecasting zero net capital inflows for the year.
 He added that this should help keep inflation in check,
forecasting that prices will rise by less than 0.6 percent in
June and no more than 6 percent for 2010 as a whole.
 Nonetheless, there is still potential for a rise in
inflationary pressures in the final quarter ""linked to the rise
in money supply, the monetary base, the pick up in lending, the
recovery in the economy"", Ulyukayev said, adding that GDP could
grow by more than 5 percent this year.
 ""If ... the cycle of rate cuts is over or has paused, in
that situation, if we see that there are inflation risks, we
could use the mechanism of reserve requirements,"" he said.
 Russia could also differentiate reserve requirements, making
them higher for foreign currency obligations.
 ""The differentiation of the requirement is quite possible
but we must look at banks' balances, their foreign currency
position, the dynamics of net foreign currency assets. For now
there is nothing threatening happening here,"" he said.
 ""But if the situation changes we will consider the issue.""
 Ulyukayev also reiterated Russia's commitment to move away
from an exchange rate focus to target inflation while still
retaining the right to intervene in the currency market.
 
 FAITH IN EURO, EYEING CAD AND AUD
 Russia, the holder of the world's third largest gold and
forex reserves, has reiterated its faith in the euro in the wake
of the fiscal troubles in the euro zone -- a stance Ulyukayev
repeated again in the interview.
 ""We are not changing the share of the euro, we are not
changing the official structure of the reserves,"" he said.
 ""The euro is a reserve currency and I think this status will
remain in the future ... I think there is a good chance that
everything ends well. So I do not see a catastrophe, or big
concerns with the euro.""
 The foreign currency part of Russia's $450 billion reserves
remains unchanged at 47 percent U.S. dollars, 41 percent euros,
10 percent sterling and 2 percent yen. Despite pledging to add
the Canadian dollar, Ulyukayev said Russia has yet to do so
because of technical reasons. The Australian dollar has also
previously been mentioned as a possible investment candidate.
 ""With the Australian dollar, it's just an idea. While with
the Canadian dollar it is already a project, we are working on
it, with the Australian one it is just thoughts,"" he said.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - The euro edged down broadly on
Friday after investors pulled back from riskier assets as share
prices fell, but the market was wary of chasing prices
aggressively ahead of a Group of 20 leaders' summit.
 European shares shed early gains to trade down 0.5 percent
at 1,015.52. U.S. stock futures were also down 0.4 percent.
 ""A little bit of risk aversion is creeping in, equity
markets are under pressure,"" said Ian Stannard, senior currency
strategist at BNP Paribas. ""We believe the euro is still
vulnerable.""
 Funding concerns in the euro zone also raised some jitters
as banks need to repay some 442 billion euros in one-year loans
to the European Central Bank next week.
 By 0933 GMT, the euro had fallen 0.4 percent to $1.2274, off
from the day's high of $1.2351. Stop-loss sales below $1.2300
accelerated declines, traders said.
 Next support was seen around $1.2210, near the week's low
and below that $1.2145 was seen a pivotal level. Resistance was
seen near the week's high of $1.2490.
 Options with a strike price of $1.2300 were set to expire
later in the day, traders said.
 The single currency was also on track to fall 1.2 percent
against the dollar on the week, after two previous weeks of
gains.
 Against the yen, the euro was down 0.5 percent at 109.87 yen
. The euro also hit a lifetime low against the Swiss franc at
1.3510 francs.
 
 G20 EYED
 Market players were wary of a lack of consensus at the G20
summit with open disagreements about how quickly to shrink
government deficits, how best to strengthen banks so they can
withstand any new downturn, and how to harmonize financial
regulatory reforms.
 Analysts say currency issues were unlikely to come to the
fore as China took steps last week to de-peg its currency.
 ""It was tactical of China to move ahead of the G20 to rule
out further pressure about its currency,"" said Roberto Mialich,
currency strategist at Unicredit in Milan.
 On Friday, China's central bank set the yuan's daily
mid-point at 6.7896 per dollar, the highest level since the July
2005 revaluation. It meant China has allowed its reference rate
to rise 0.6 percent this week.
 Concerns about sovereign debt and the economic outlook were
likely to weigh on riskier assets, with the yen and Swiss franc
seen benefitting the most going forward, analysts said.
 The dollar, which is also normally seen as a safe haven, may
struggle after the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this week gave a
less optimistic view on the economy and reiterated interest
rates would remain low for an extended period.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up
0.3 percent at 86.035, but remained below the week's high of
86.415.
 The dollar stood flat at 89.59 yen, near a 1-month low of
89.22 yen on trading platform EBS on Thursday.
 Dollar/yen options barriers at 89 yen and below are likely
to check gains for the Japanese currency in the near-term but
some traders said momentum indicated the yen would eventually
test the year's high of 87.95 yen hit on May 6.
 The Australian dollar pared gains to trade down 0.7 percent
at $0.8606, near a support level of $0.8600.

carmaker, Kia Motors, expects the launch of a new sport utility
vehicle (SUV) to help boost output at its Slovak factory to
pre-crisis levels, a top executive said.
 Kia, which has an assembly plant in the northern Slovak town
of Zilina with an annual capacity of 300,000 vehicles, is one of
the euro zone country's key exporters.
 ""We plan to produce more than 35,000 units of this SUV model
this year,"" Kia Motors Slovakia Chief Executive In-Kyu Bae told
reporters on Friday.
The CEO saw 2010 production exceeding 200,000 units, up from
150,020 vehicles last year. The plant makes the Kia Cee'd, new
generation SUV Kia Sportage and Hyundai ix35 models.
 Hyundai Motor and sister company Kia are using factories in
Slovakia and the neighbouring Czech Republic as a base for sales
in Europe.
 Production in Slovakia totalled 201,000 units in 2008,
before the global economic crisis hit new car demand.
 Slovakia's car industry, including assembly plants of
Volkswagen and PSA Peugeot Citroen, is a key driver of the
heavily export-reliant Slovak economy, which contracted 4.7
percent in 2009 and is expected to grow about 3 percent this
year.

 By Jan Korselt
 PRAGUE, June 25 (Reuters) - Czech President Vaclav Klaus
accepted the resignation of caretaker Prime Minister Jan Fischer
on Friday but asked him to stay on until a new cabinet takes
power following a May election.
 The resignation, required by law, came after the opening
session of the new lower house this week and allows Klaus to
appoint a new prime minister, which will almost certainly be
right-wing Civic Democrat Petr Necas.
 Necas is leading coalition talks with two other centre-right
parties, TOP09 and Public Affairs, after the three won a
combined 118 seats of 200 in a May 28-29 general election.
 Necas has said he wants a deal by early July so a new
government can prepare a cost-cutting 2011 budget.
 Fischer and his caretaker cabinet took power in May 2009
after a previous centre-right cabinet collapsed halfway through
the country's stint at the European Union presidency.
 ""This government was created in a very complicated
situation,"" Klaus said after meeting Fischer. ""I think it is
certainly possible to say it fulfilled its role.""
 
 AUSTERITY MEASURES
 At the height of the economic crisis in central Europe, the
cabinet pushed austerity measures through parliament to try and
cut the fiscal deficit to a planned 5.3 percent of economic
output in 2010, from 5.9 percent in 2009.
 The three centre-right parties won the May election with
pledges of austerity and plans to battle corruption and have
pledged to cut the fiscal gap to at least 4.8 of GDP in 2011.
 Investors, analysts and rating agencies cheered the
centre-right victory as the best possible outcome from the
election, and the most likely grouping to kick-start needed
reforms in pensions and healthcare -- areas in which the country
of 10.5 million has lagged behind neighbours in the past.
 They have yet to agree on specific details how to cut the
budget gap but are all against any major tax hikes.

 LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Worries about the fragility of
global economic recovery hit financial markets again on Friday,
knocking world stocks down for the fourth session in a row ahead
of a summit of Group of 20 nations.
 The dollar gained slightly and the euro slipped. Wall Street
looked set to open moderately higher.
 Investors have pulled back a bit from riskier assets this
week as evidence built that economic growth, particularly in the
United States, may be slowing.
 This has combined with fears that the spending cuts and tax
rises being promulgated by European governments to cut debt will
hurt the recovery.
 G8 leaders meeting on Friday in Canada -- turning into the
G20 on Saturday -- are set to grapple with this issue with
Washington warning against cutting too far and too fast.
 ""The cohesion generally evident among policymakers in
dealing with the global crisis is in danger of giving way to a
more divisive debate about how to manage the recovery,"" Credit
Agricole analysts said in a morning note to clients.
 MSCI's all-country world index was down 0.4 percent, heading
for a 3 percent weekly loss. Its emerging market counterpart
was down 0.7 percent.
 European shares turned negative after initially bucking the
trend. The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.4 percent adding to three
previous days of losses.
 ""No one is really wanting to take any big positions ahead of
the G20,"" said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven
Investment Management.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average fell 1.9 percent.
 
 DOLLAR FIRMER
 The dollar was up slightly against a basket of major
currencies and gains against the euro.
 The European currency was down a third of a percent at
$1.2293 with funding concerns raising some jitters as banks need

 LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - The dollar made little headway
on Friday in subdued trade as traders marked time ahead of a
Group of 20 leaders' summit this weekend, but remained wary
about chasing riskier assets given debt and growth worries.
 The yen held near one-month highs against the dollar hit on
Thursday.
 Market players were wary of a lack of consensus at the G20
summit with open disagreements about how quickly to shrink
government deficits, how best to strengthen banks so they can
withstand any new downturn, and how to harmonize financial
regulatory reforms.
 ""It's a little bit of strange situation as the euro should
usually suffer more in periods of risk aversion, but we are
seeing some position adjustments ahead of the G20,"" said Roberto

 ""The yen and Swiss franc are expected to stay firmly bid on
the back of risk aversion,"" he said.
 By 0743 GMT, the euro was flat on the day at $1.2330, with a
downside target seen around the $1.2150/1.2200 area. Resistance
was seen near the week's high of $1.2490.
 Traders will also keep an eye on stock markets for direction
as the euro remains highly correlated with the S&P 500 index at
a solid 63 percent.
 S&P 500 stock futures were 0.3 percent higher in early
European trade. European shares also gained after Tokyo's Nikkei
stock average dropped 2 percent.
 
 DOLLAR STRUGGLES
 While the dollar is normally seen as a safe haven, it has
struggled to rise after the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this
week gave a less optimistic view on the economy and reiterated
interest rates would remain low for an extended period.
 Concerns about any fallout for U.S. banks, as U.S. lawmakers
sought to finalise financial reform bills, also kept the
greenback on the back foot.
 The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the
greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was
little changed at 85.67. Support was seen near the week's low of
85.09.
 The dollar stood at 89.66 yen after hitting a 1-month low of
89.22 yen on trading platform EBS on Thursday.
 Dollar/yen options barriers at 89 yen and below are likely
to check gains for the Japanese currency in the near-term but
some traders said momentum indicated the yen would eventually

 Declines in Asian shares prompted yen buying against other
currencies as investors pared back risk.

 G20 discussions on currency issues, particularly the Chinese

 * Officials insist yuan's appreciation will be gradual
 * Unshackling yuan timed for G20 meet, but will it be
enough?
 By Langi Chiang and Alan Wheatley
 BEIJING, June 25 (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Commerce,
a long-standing opponent of a stronger yuan, fell into line on
Friday behind the scrapping of the currency's peg to the dollar
but said the exchange rate would climb only gradually.
 The ministry has traditionally resisted a rise in the yuan
arguing it would spell bankruptcy for many export-oriented
manufacturers working on thin margins.
 But Vice Commerce Minister Jiang Yaoping said the impact of
the exchange rate was secondary to a host of other factors,
including final demand, wages, the cost of raw materials, the
level of interest rates and tax rates.
 ""Looking at the timing of China's currency reform, we can
say that the overall benefits to exports are greater than the
damage,"" he told a forum.
 The People's Bank of China said on Saturday that it would
once again allow the yuan to move more freely after having kept
the currency more or less pegged to the dollar for two years to
provide stability for exporters during the global downturn.
 The yuan has risen about 0.5 percent against the dollar
since then to its highest level since its July 2005
revaluation, though gains have been kept in check by big
state-owned banks.

 Jiang cited conditions in 2005-2008, when Chinese exports
continued to grow strongly despite a cumulative 21 percent rise
in the yuan against the dollar.
 But he said the pace of future currency appreciation would
be gradual and rejected charges that China was unfairly holding
down the yuan to give its companies an advantage in global
markets.
 Some Western economists believe the yuan is undervalued by
as much as 40 percent.
 Jiang sidestepped a question about whether exporters could
cope with a yuan rise of 3 to 5 percent within a year, saying
the rate of appreciation would be decided by the market.
 ""First, China's yuan currency reform will be gradual.
Second, accusations that China is manipulating its currency are
groundless. The facts have proved that it's not true.""
 NOT TOO QUICK
 A second government official also ruled out a big move in
the yuan in coming months and said last Saturday's announcement
was timed to take pressure off China at this weekend's summit
of Group of 20 leading economies in Toronto.
 ""In the longer term, the yuan will appreciate but only very
gradually,"" the official, who declined to be identified, said.
 The comments are likely to be grist for the mill of U.S.
lawmakers who are sceptical of China's willingness to permit a
substantial rise in the value of a currency they argue is kept
deliberately undervalued, to the detriment of U.S. jobs.
 As the dominant player in China's tightly controlled
currency market, the PBOC could let the yuan appreciate more
swiftly by scaling back its purchases of dollars.
 Thanks to the central bank's intervention down the years,
China has built a stockpile of official currency reserves worth
$2.45 trillion at the end of March.
 With Congress weighing legislation to prod Beijing to relax
its grip, U.S. President Barack Obama said China had made
progress by announcing greater currency flexibility, but it was
too early to say whether it would go far enough.
 ""The initial signs were positive. But it is too early to
tell whether the appreciation, that will track the market, is
sufficient to allow for the rebalancing that we think is
appropriate,"" Obama said on Thursday.
 The PBOC has said the main aim of reverting to the managed
float that it suspended in mid-2008 is to inject more two-way
volatility into the currency, not to propel it sharply higher.
 Some economists have speculated that the central bank, to
underline its point, might let the yuan decline at times, for
instance if the euro were to fall further against the dollar.
 But the second government official ruled out this option as
a political non-starter.
 ""It would be too costly because it would lead to more
criticism and pressure from the international community,"" he
said.
 ""You know, so many eyes are now trained on China's foreign
exchange policy.""

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, June 25 (Reuters) - The yen rose broadly and stayed
near a 1-month high against the dollar on Friday on short
covering, and as falls in regional share markets prompted traders
to further sell risky currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 The euro and Australian dollar fell against the greenback on
investor doubts about the strength of a global recovery, and were
also dragged lower by their weakness against the yen.
 The yen and dollar were also supported by concerns that
leaders of the Group of Eight and Group of 20 rich and developing
nations may not produce a strong and unified response to help the
economic recovery at their weekend meetings in Canada.
 ""It's all about cutting risky positions with falls in yen
crosses leading the market,"" said a trader for a Japanese trust
bank.
 Traders said quarter-end inflows were lending support to the
yen, with Japanese exporters selling the euro.
 Dollar/yen options barriers at 89 yen and below are likely to
check gains for the Japanese currency in the near-term but some
traders said momentum indicated the yen would eventually test
87.95 yen, a high hit on May 6.
 Traders said many investors who had gone short on the yen
this month on speculation that Japan's new Prime Minister Naoto
Kan will support a weaker yen were unwinding those positions.
 Also helping the yen was the Federal Reserve's dovish
statement this week, which contributed to a further fall in
already low Treasury yields.
 The dollar stood at 89.52 yen, down 0.1 percent from late U.S
trade on Thursday, when it lost about 0.4 percent and hit a
1-month low of 89.22 yen on trading platform EBS.
 Japanese exporters are expected to move quickly to sell the
dollar early on Monday if dollar/yen finishes Friday trade below
90.00 yen as they have to convert overseas earnings towards the
end of the month, traders said.
 The dollar index was flat on the day at 85.77, with traders
expecting it to test support at 85.09, this week's low, in the
near term as softer Treasury yields keep it on the defensive.
 U.S. economic reports on weekly initial jobless claims and
durable goods orders for May on Thursday were relatively firm yet
could not lighten the market gloom.
 The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.2320, giving up some gains
made on Thursday when quarter-end buying by portfolio managers
helped the currency despite worries about the euro zone's debt
and financial sector.
Gains in the euro were likely to be checked by losses in stock
markets, with the currency remaining highly correlated with the
S&P 500 index at a solid 63 percent.
 S&P 500 stock futures inched up 0.3 percent on Friday in
Asia, while Tokyo's Nikkei stock average dropped 2 percent,
prompting investors to feel more nervous about taking on risk.
 Against the Japanese currency, the euro fell 0.2 percent to
110.27 yen after falling as low as 110.04 yen on EBS.
 The Australian dollar slid 0.5 percent to $0.8625, having
lost 0.9 percent on Thursday as investors booked profits in
high-yielding currencies after a rally this week.
 Uncertainty over Australia's mining tax after remarks from
the country's new Prime Minister Julia Gillard was also seen as a
negative for the currency, traders said.
 Gillard said she was open to genuine negotiations with global
miners over the government's planned mining-profits tax, but
declined comment on the 40-percent headline rate.
 Some market players hope a change of leadership would lead to
a softening in policy on the 40-percent proposed mining tax.
 China's central bank set the yuan's daily mid-point at 6.7896
par dollar on Friday, the highest level since the July 2005
revaluation. It meant China has allowed its reference rate to
rise 0.6 percent this week since it announced a change in the
yuan exchange regime at the weekend.
 The euro and the Australian initially edged up on the news
then quickly gave back gains.

 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, June 25 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive on
Friday on doubts about a recovery in the U.S. economy while short
covering and a general wariness towards riskier assets kept the
yen near a one-month high against the greenback.
 Traders said quarter-end inflows were lending support to the
yen, with Japanese exporters selling the euro.
 At the same time, options barriers at 89 yen and below are
likely to check the Japanese currency's gains, traders said.
 In Asian trade, the dollar stood at 89.65, up 0.1 percent
from late U.S trade on Thursday, when it lost about 0.4 percent.
Traders said short-term momentum favoured an eventual break lower
for a test of 87.95 yen, the May 6 low.
 Traders said many investors who had gone short of the yen
earlier this month on speculation that Japan's new Prime Minister
Naoto Kan will support a weaker yen were unwinding those
positions.
 Also helping the yen was the Federal Reserve's dovish
statement this week, which contributed to a further fall in
already low Treasury yields.
 The Fed on Wednesday renewed its promise to hold interest
rates very low for an extended period, as expected, but also
acknowledged a faltering pace of U.S. recovery.
 ""Things are not looking good for the dollar,"" said Hideki
Amikura, deputy general manager of FX trading at Nomura Trust and
Banking.
 ""The U.S. economy is not as healthy as people had expected,
with comments from the Fed backing up that view.""
 The dollar could fall further against the yen after the Group
of 20 leaders' summit on June 26-27 in Canada, though short
covering before the event could give it a near-term boost,
Amikura said.
 The dollar index was flat on the day at 85.76, with traders
expecting it to test support at 85.09, this week's low, in the
near term as softer yields keep it on the defensive.
 U.S. economic reports on weekly initial jobless claims and
durable goods orders for May on Thursday were relatively firm yet
could not lighten the market gloom.
 The euro was little moved at $1.2330, retaining gains made on
Thursday when quarter-end real money buying helped the currency
despite the ongoing worries about the euro zone's debt and
financial sector.
 Still, gains in the euro are likely to be checked by losses
in stock markets, with the currency remaining highly correlated
with the S&P 500 index at a solid 63 percent.
 S&P 500 stock futures inched up 0.3 percent on Friday in
Asia, while Tokyo's Nikkei stock average dropped 1.5 percent,
prompting investors to feel more nervous about risks.
 ""The FX market should continue to take its lead from the
stock market with further pressure in the risk market suggesting
continued outperformances in the yen and the U.S. dollar at the
cost of high beta currencies,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 Against the Japanese currency, the euro was little moved at
110.43 after falling as low as 110.24 yen.
 The Australian dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.8663, having
lost 0.9 percent on Thursday as investors booked profits in
high-yielding currencies after the recent rally earlier this
week.
 The Aussie was seen supported at $0.8650, close to its 10-day
moving average, with stops seen being placed down around $0.8605.
 China's central bank set the yuan's daily mid-point at 6.7896
par dollar on Friday, the highest level since the July 2005
revaluation. It meant China has allowed its reference rate to
rise 0.6 percent this week since it announced a change in the
yuan exchange regime at the weekend.
 The euro and the Australian initially edged up on the news
then quickly gave back gains.
 Trading the U.S. dollar against currencies such as the
Australian dollar and the euro based on short-term moves in the
yuan had become a market fad earlier this week but such trading
interest has waned.

 HONG KONG, June 25 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell for a
fourth straight session on Friday, driven by expectations of
tighter financial regulation ahead of the weekend G20 meeting
and uncertainty about the global economic recovery.
 Major European stocks were expected to edge up as much as
0.5 percent after three days of selling, financial bookmakers
said, though investor conviction was low after discouraging
outlooks from U.S. retailers overnight.
 Part of the weakness in Asia was attributable to
profit-taking after a powerful rally in risky assets on Monday
on the back of China's decision to unpeg the yuan.
 However, differences among Group of 20 leaders ahead of a
summit in Toronto over how to secure the economic recovery
caused investor concern, particularly with leading indicators
reflecting a slowdown ahead. [ID:nN24260273]
 ""The fundamental backdrop has not significantly changed of
late, which could mean risk aversion persists as we finish the
first half of the year,"" Gareth Berry, currency strategist with
UBS in Singapore, said in note.
 ""Risk sentiment could remain unstable as investors may be
increasingly worried on growth prospects in the U.S., which
could weigh on demand conditions for commodities and equities
in turn.""
 Japan's Nikkei share average <.N225> led equity market
declines in Asia, falling 1.9 percent to close below its 25-day
moving average in what was seen as a negative short-term signal
for Japanese stocks. Index heavyweights such as Fanuc <6954.T>
and Canon <7751.T> saw their shares drop 4.6 percent and 4.5
percent, respectively.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 1.4 percent, dragged down the most by the
technology and resource-related sectors.
 Financials outperformed slightly on the day though not on
the week, with talk of a bank tax expected to be among the
topics discussed at a G20 summit in Toronto over the weekend.
 For the week, the Asia-Pacific index was largely unchanged.
In a reversal of sectoral performance for most of the year, the
industrial and materials segments, which includes mining
stocks, outperformed, while IT was the biggest underperformer.
 TOUGHER RULES FOR BANKS?

 * Yen holds broad gains on short covering, qtr-end flows
 * Dollar index flat, seen on the defensive on recovery doubts
 * Euro firm, but euro zone worries and stocks to cap gains
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 25 (Reuters) - The dollar was on the defensive
on Friday on doubts about a recovery in the U.S. economy while
short covering and a general wariness towards riskier assets
supported the yen.
 Traders said quarter-end inflows were likely to help the yen
, although option barriers at 89 yen and below are likely
to check the Japanese's currency's gains.
 In Asian trade, the dollar  was at 89.55 yen, compared
with 89.45 late in New York on Thursday, when it lost about 0.4
percent. Traders said short-term momentum favoured an eventual
break lower for a test of 87.95 yen, the May 6 low.
 Traders said many investors who had gone short of the yen
earlier this month on speculation that Japan's new Prime Minister
Naoto Kan will support a weaker yen, were unwinding those
positions.
 Also helping the yen was the Federal Reserve's dovish
statement this week, which contributed to a further fall in
already low Treasury yields.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was flat at 85.74, with traders
expecting it to test support at 85.09, this week's low, in the
near term as softer yields keep it on the defensive.
 U.S. economic reports on weekly initial jobless claims and
durable goods orders for May on Thursday were relatively firm yet
could not lighten the market gloom.
 The euro  was firm at $1.2336, retaining gains made on
Thursday when quarter-end real money buying helped the currency
despite the ongoing worries about the euro zone's debt and
financial sector.
 Still, gains in the euro are likely to be checked by losses
in stock markets, with the currency remaining highly correlated
with the S&P 500 index <.SPX> at a solid 63 percent.
 ""The FX market should continue to take its lead from the
stock market with further pressure in the risk market suggesting
continued outperformances in the yen and the U.S. dollar at the
cost of high beta currencies,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 The Australian dollar  was flat at $0.8671, having
lost 0.9 percent on Thursday as investors booked profits in
high-yielding currencies after the recent rally earlier this
week.
 The Aussie was seen supported at $0.8650, close to its 10-day
moving average, with stops seen being placed down around $0.8605.

 By Ka Yan Ng and Glenn Somerville
 TORONTO/WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - World leaders aimed
for a common target on Thursday of securing the economic
recovery, but disagreed over how best to reach it.
 With two days to go before the Group of 20 summit convenes
in Toronto, officials tried to downplay differences between the
United States and Europe over how quickly to shift from
crisis-fighting mode to budgetary belt-tightening.
 ""That's the delicate balance that we need to try to strike
this weekend,"" Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said.
 His U.S. counterpart, Timothy Geithner, said each country
needed to decide what policy mix made sense to ensure both
growth and fiscal responsibility.
 ""Our job is to make sure we're all sitting there together,
focused on this challenge of growth and confidence because
growth and confidence are paramount,"" he said in an interview
with BBC World News America.
 The G20 club of rich and emerging economies joined forces
at the height of the global financial panic and poured an
estimated $5 trillion into stimulus spending, emergency loans
and bank guarantees, helping to ward off a global depression.
 The group still has a long and difficult to-do list,
including forging consensus on new rules about how much capital
that banks must hold, and making sure national financial
regulatory reforms do not clash on a global scale.
 The cost of fighting the financial crisis and recession
left gaping holes in government finances, and Greece's debt
troubles have focused Europe's attention on the need to shrink
budget deficits before investors lose patience.
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said
Europe could no longer afford to borrow and spend, and must
repair budgets in order to rebuild confidence for growth.
 ""It will not be a change overnight but there is no more
room for deficit spending,"" Barroso told a news conference in
Toronto.
 The United States wants to make sure European countries --
Germany, in particular -- do not remove government supports too
quickly because that could derail the recovery.
 U.S. stocks fell on Thursday on concerns over the
durability of the economic rebound.
 President Barack Obama, pushing Washington's pro-growth,
line, said ""surplus countries"" -- often code for Germany and
China -- must find ways to stimulate growth. But he also
acknowledged that countries including the United States with
medium- and long-term deficit problems would have to address
them.
 ""Not every country is going to respond exactly the same
way, but all of us are going to have responsibilities to
rebalance in ways that allow for long-term, sustained economic
growth,"" Obama said in Washington during an appearance with
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.
 White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, in an
interview with Reuters, also stressed that growth would be key,
but said it was not simply a matter of choosing between
austerity and expansion.
 ""There obviously is an importance in having a growth
strategy, but I think it's too simple to think of growth
strategies only as running budget deficits or printing money,""
he said.
 In Europe, senior officials were in no mood to back down on
their plans to cut spending.
 Saying she expected ""controversial discussions"" in Toronto
over Europe's budget priorities, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel insisted Berlin would forge ahead with its biggest
program of fiscal cutbacks since World War Two.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
dismissed the idea budget cuts could torpedo the fragile
economic recovery that is taking hold.
 ""The idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation
is incorrect,"" Trichet told Italian newspaper La Repubblica,
describing the German budget plans as ""good"" and repeating
calls for more fiscal discipline in the 16-nation euro zone.
 Merkel, who aims to save 80 billion euros in the next four
years, told ARD television that sustained growth could only be
guaranteed through getting a grip on deficits and debt.
 ""I and the EU will argue this position. There are others
who are not yet so convinced of this exit strategy,"" she said.
 The G20, which includes the world's biggest economies and
two-thirds of its population, holds its summit in Toronto on
Saturday and Sunday. It will be preceded by a meeting on Friday
and Saturday of the G8, composed of Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
 Downtown Toronto's downtown banking district has seen
business drop off as heavy security is mounted. Canadian police
said on Thursday they had arrested the driver of a car near the
meeting site who was carrying a chainsaw, crossbow and fuel
containers.
 BANKING REFORM
 Economic policy has not been the only issue dividing the
G20, which has also seen its unity tested by reforms to the
banking sector.
 European proposals for global taxes on banks and financial
transactions have run into opposition from countries like
Canada that say their banks are in good health.
 European countries are concerned that planned new rules
requiring banks to set aside more capital may crimp lending.
 Obama, meanwhile, hopes to sign off on rules to regulate
finance within weeks as lawmakers raced to meet a Thursday
deadline they had set themselves to agree on their own
financial overhaul package.
 Obama signaled on Thursday that China's move this week to
relax the peg of its currency, the yuan, to the dollar may not
be enough to shield Beijing from accusations that it is using
the currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.
 ""The initial signs were positive. But it is too early to
tell whether the appreciation, that will track the market, is
sufficient to allow for the rebalancing that we think is
appropriate,"" Obama said.
 The yuan has risen by about 0.4 percent against the dollar
since Beijing's policy change -- a significant step relative to
its earlier freeze, but far less than the 25 to 40 percent
increase that some analysts say it needs to make to achieve
fair value.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 24 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened a
fourth consecutive session against the U.S. currency on
Thursday, pressured by a global retreat from riskier assets and
a rethink on the outlook for the global economy.
 The currency finished at C$1.0437 to the U.S. dollar, or
95.81 U.S. cents, down from Wednesday's finish at C$1.0384 to
the U.S. dollar, or 96.30 U.S. cents.
 It touched a two-week low earlier in the session, hitting
C$1.0470 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.51 U.S. cents.
 ""Canada is still going to look vulnerable for the next few
days,"" said Michael O'Neill, managing director at Knightsbridge
Foreign Exchange, pointing to month- and quarter-end flows.
 A subdued assessment of the U.S. economy by the Federal
Reserve continued to weigh on world stocks and oil prices,
while a recent wave of soft economic reports helped trigger a
steep drop in the Canadian dollar this week.
 It appears that the U.S. central bank will hold its key
interest rate near zero for ""an extended period,"" which could
have implications on how aggressive the Bank of Canada can be
with its own rate hike program, which began this month.
 Yields on overnight index swaps, which trade based on
expectations for the central bank's key policy rate, now point
to a 63.26 percent chance of a 25 basis point hike on July 20.
That is down from 80 percent earlier this week. 
 ""The backdrop still remains extremely dicey,"" said David
Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""Central banks are starting to ... express some very
notable concern about the situation, and that is getting a lot
of people rethinking rate profiles for central banks.""
 Market players are also monitoring developments in the
run-up to two international summits in Canada this week, with
leaders of the Group of Eight and Group of 20 nations coming
together to discuss priorities for a world emerging from
recession. [ID:nN18322198]
 Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Thursday
that a key issue for the G20 would be striking the right
balance between growth and fiscal consolidation.
[ID:nN24145434]
 BONDS MIXED, BUT OUTPERFORM
 With no major economic data to speak of, Canadian
government bond prices were mixed with moves straddling
unchanged and lacking conviction.
 Weak stock markets and a paring back of rate hike
expectations helped feed the short end of the curve, as
investors favored the relative safety of government debt.
 The two-year government bond  was up 5 Canadian
cents to yield 1.584 percent. while the 10-year bond
 dipped 5 Canadian cents to yield 3.239 percent.
 Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. issues across the curve.
The Canadian 10-year bond yield was 10.5 basis points above its
U.S. counterpart, compared with 10.8 basis points in the
previous session.

(Updates prices, adds quote)
 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
euro and yen on Thursday, still reeling from a less-bullish
outlook on the U.S. economy by the Federal Reserve the previous
session.
 The euro's rise, however, was partly limited by steep
losses in the U.S. stock market, with the currency remaining
highly correlated with the S&P 500 index at a solid 63
percent.
 Earlier euro gains against the dollar were mostly due to
buying from real money, or long-term investors, who have been
extremely short the single currency for some time, traders
said.
 The Fed's less-upbeat view on the U.S. economy gave these
investors an excuse to unwind some of their short positions in
the euro.
 ""The dollar has been well-offered for most of the session
and that's mostly on the back of the Fed's concerns about U.S.
growth,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange
trading at ING Capital Markets in New York.
 Worries over Greece still hung over the euro zone as the
cost of protecting its government debt against default hit a
record high. Traders said this should cap the euro's gains.
 But they added that levels above $1.2350 should keep bids
on the euro and if it goes above $1.2380-90, that could trigger
stops from $1.2400 and beyond.
 In late afternoon trading, the euro rose 0.1 percent to
$1.2325  against the dollar, having risen as high as
$1.2388, according to electronic trading platform EBS.
 If the euro can continue to trade higher, the next
resistance lurks between $1.2405 and $1.2415, said Dan Cook,
senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago. ""A break beyond
this zone though and a retest of this month's high at 1.2467
would seem likely.""
 Near-term support in the euro, meanwhile, may be found
between $1.2245 and $1.2265.
 The euro was down 0.3 percent versus the yen at 110.32 yen
, while the dollar fell 0.4 percent to 89.47 yen
after earlier hitting a one-month low at 89.22 .
 U.S. economic reports on weekly initial jobless claims and
durable goods orders for May came in largely in line with
expectations, causing the dollar to extend declines against the
yen.
 The U.S. dollar had already been under pressure in Asian
trading as investors initially took the view the Fed's renewed
pledge to keep rates on hold for an extended period would be a
positive for the world economy, briefly boosting risky assets
like commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian
dollar.
 European investors chose to focus on the Fed's scaling back
of its assessment of the pace of recovery, leading them buy the
yen and sell the dollar.
 Sterling rose to a 19-month high versus the euro. British
assets were still being bolstered by Tuesday's tough budget,
which investors perceive as necessary to tackle a huge deficit
as fiscal worries plague the euro zone. The pound last traded
at $1.4922 , down 0.3 percent on the day.
 The Aussie dollar reversed gains after rising as high as
US$0.8771  as Australia's ruling Labor Party elected
Julia Gillard as the new prime minister.
 Gillard immediately offered to end a bitter dispute over a
controversial ""super profits"" mining tax, saying she would
throw open the door for fresh negotiations. But she stressed
miners should pay more taxes.
 In late trading, the Aussie fell 0.9 percent to US$0.8661.

 * Obama says still too early to tell if yuan rise enough
 (Updates with more Obama remarks, details, byline)
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
said on Thursday China had made progress by announcing greater
currency flexibility, but it was ""too early to tell"" if the
yuan's rise would be enough to help rebalance world growth.
 Obama, speaking at a joint news conference with visiting
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, said initial signs were
positive, and the gradual change witnessed so far in the
currency's value against the dollar were no surprise.
 ""We did not expect a complete 20 percent appreciation
overnight, for example, simply because that would be extremely
disruptive to world currency markets and to the Chinese
economy,"" Obama said, making plain he welcomed the decision.
 ""I think China made progress by making its announcement
that it is going to be returning to its phased-in, market-based
approach"" to the currency, Obama said.
 In a move intended to defuse likely criticism at the
upcoming Group of 20 summit for its currency policy, China on
Saturday announced it would allow more flexibility of the yuan,
which had been tightly pegged against the dollar for the last
two years.
 U.S. lawmakers claim China is stealing precious American
jobs by keeping the yuan artificially low against the dollar,
which makes Chinese exports to the United States cheaper and
U.S. exports to China more expensive in dollar terms.
 As a result, Congress is weighing legislation to encourage
Beijing to let the yuan rise. House of Representatives Ways and
Means Committee Chairman Sander Levin said this should remain
an option if the currency did not move fast enough.
 Obama is under pressure in an election year to fight for
American workers. But he needs Chinese cooperation in other
areas important to U.S. interests, like pressuring Iran and
North Korea for their nuclear programs, and has opted for quiet
diplomacy with China on the highly delicate issue of the yuan.
 G20
 Both leaders are heading to the Group of Eight and Group of
20 rich and developing nations, which meet in Canada June 25-27
to review the outlook for global growth.
 The yuan ended higher against the dollar on Thursday at
6.7997, up from Wednesday's close of 6.8124. But dealers said
there was no sign that the People's Bank of China was
encouraging a sharp rise in its currency.
 Obama, who must weigh whether he characterizes China as a
currency manipulator in a report to Congress, said only time
would tell. But he hinted a year was a reasonable benchmark.
 ""The initial signs were positive. But it is too early to
tell whether the appreciation, that will track the market, is
sufficient to allow for the rebalancing that we think is
appropriate,"" Obama said.
 ""If that trajectory indicates that over the course of a
year, the (yuan) has appreciated a certain amount, that it is
more in line with economic fundamentals, then hopefully not
only will that be good for the U.S. economy, that will also be
good for the Chinese economy,"" he said.
 The peg has contributed to a massive surplus in the Chinese
trade account with the United States, which economists fear is
an unsustainable imbalance that could renew global financial
instability if it undermined dollar confidence.
 Economists argue the yuan is undervalued against the dollar
by as much as 40 percent.
 The regular congressional report was delayed from its April
publication date until after the G20. Obama said he would leave
the decision on whether to cite China for currency manipulation
to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, but reiterated his
argument the yuan was being kept too low.
 ""We have said consistently that we believe that the (yuan)
is undervalued, that that provides China with an unfair trade
advantage, and that we expect change,"" he said.
 Action by Congress could embarrass Beijing and complicate
relations with Washington.
 Senator Charles Schumer and co-authors of the most
prominent version of the China currency bill say their
legislation enjoys overwhelming support.
 But it is not clear where that bill might fit in a crowded
legislative agenda or whether it would face a veto by Obama,
who so far has focused on diplomacy to advance the U.S. goal of
getting China to cut its huge trade surplus.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against the
euro and yen on Thursday, still reeling from a less bullish
outlook on the U.S. economy from the Federal Reserve the
previous session.
 Gains by the euro against the dollar were mostly
flows-driven from real money or long-term investors, who have
been extremely short the single euro zone currency for some
time, traders said.
 The Fed's less upbeat view on the U.S. economy gave these
investors an excuse to unwind some of their short positions in
the euro.
 ""The dollar has been well-offered for most of the session
and that's mostly on the back of the Fed's concerns about U.S.
growth,"" said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange
trading at ING Capital Markets in New York.
 Worries over Greece still hung over the euro zone as the
cost of protecting its government debt against default hit a
record high and traders say this should cap the euro's gains.
 But they added that levels above $1.2350 should keep bids
on the euro and if it goes $1.2380-90 could trigger stops from
and $1.2400 and beyond, traders say.
 In early afternoon trading, the euro rose 0.3 percent to
$1.2348  against the dollar, having risen as high as
$1.2388, according to electronic trading platform
EBS.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent versus the yen at 110.36 yen
, while the dollar fell 0.5 percent to 89.40 yen,
after earlier hitting a one-month low at 89.22 .
 U.S. economic reports on weekly initial jobless claims and
durable goods orders for May came in largely in line with
expectations and saw the dollar extend declines against the
yen.
 The U.S. dollar had already been under pressure in Asian
trading as investors initially took the view the Fed's renewed
pledge to keep rates on hold for an extended period would be a
positive for the world economy, briefly boosting risky assets
like commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian
dollar.
 European investors chose to focus on the Fed's scaling back
of its assessment of the pace of recovery, leading them buy the
yen and also sell the dollar.
 ""The outlook from the Fed was more negative for interest
rates and the economy than it was before,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey.
 Sterling rose to a 19-month high versus the euro. British
assets were still being bolstered by Tuesday's tough budget,
which investors perceive as necessary to tackle a huge deficit
as fiscal worries plague the euro zone. The pound last traded
at $1.4951 , down slightly on the day.
 The Aussie dollar reversed gains after rising as high as
US$0.8771  as Australia's ruling Labor Party elected
Julia Gillard as the new prime minister in a bid to avoid
election defeat later this year.
 Gillard immediately offered to end a bitter dispute over a
controversial ""super profits"" mining tax, saying she would
throw open the door for fresh negotiations, but she stressed
miners should pay more taxes.
 The Aussie slipped to trade down 0.6 percent on the day at
US$0.8687.

 * Flaherty suggests differentiated targets likely
 * Says the more flexibility the better for yuan
(Adds quotes, details)
 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 24 (Reuters) - G20 leaders are still
discussing how quickly they should commit to cutting deficits,
Canada said on Thursday after European officials complained
that fiscal targets proposed by Ottawa did not go far enough.
 Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told reporters that
within the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies, some
required urgent action to reduce budget shortfalls, while
others could do so at a more leisurely pace.
 ""There are some more discussions about what the precise
targets would be and that's not a settled matter,"" Flaherty
said before a speech to a business audience.
 Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper sent a letter to his
G20 peers last week proposing an agreement to halve deficits by
2013 and stabilize or start reducing debt-to-GDP ratios by
2016.
 The European Union's monetary affairs chief, Olli Rehn,
told Reuters in an interview those targets were not ambitious
enough for the euro zone.
 Flaherty said a key issue for the G20 would be striking the
right balance between growth and fiscal consolidation.
 ""There are clearly some countries, particularly some
European countries, that need to fiscally consolidate on an
urgent basis,"" he said.
 ""And then there are some countries that need to fiscally
consolidate, but don't need to do so on an urgent basis, so we
need some moderation there. That's the delicate balance that we
need to try to strike this weekend beginning with fiscal
consolidation among those countries that urgently must do so so
that the markets have confidence.""
 The G20 summit takes place in Toronto on Saturday and
Sunday, preceded by a G8 meeting of advanced economies.
Flaherty said the most pressing issue for Canada on the G20
agenda was ensuring sustainable economic growth through
committing to policy action.
 On the Chinese currency appreciation, Flaherty would not
say whether he thought a 3 percent rise against the dollar this
year was enough, saying, ""The more flexibility the better."" A
Chinese central bank adviser said on Thursday the yuan was
likely to rise by 3 percent against the dollar by year-end if
the euro holds its ground against the U.S. currency.

 WASHINGTON/BERLIN, June 24 (Reuters) - The top White House
economic advisor said on Thursday world leaders must keep the
tentative global recovery on track as Europe headed into this
weekend's G20 summit defending plans for heavy cost-cutting.
 The United States and some European countries have stressed
different priorities for economic policy now that the world is
emerging from its worst slump in decades.
 Lawrence Summers, in an interview with Reuters ahead of the
Group of 20 meeting in Toronto, said governments must work to
to avoid the risk of a ""protracted stagnation"" which could
aggravate fiscal problems.
 But Summers sought to downplay differences with Europe over
the need to tackle high debts and deficits as part of the way
forward for policymakers.
 ""One important aspect of that focus needs to be...on fiscal
sustainability. Just how that's done, just what the pacing is,
is something that will inevitably vary from country to
country,"" he said.
 Top European officials defended austerity plans with German
Chancellor Angela Merkel insisting Berlin would move ahead with
its biggest program of fiscal cutbacks since World War Two.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said it
was wrong to assume budget austerity would lead to stagnation.
 ""The idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation
is incorrect,"" he told Italian newspaper La Repubblica,
describing the German budget plans as ""good"" and repeating
calls for more fiscal discipline in the 16-nation euro zone.
 Merkel, who aims to save 80 billion euros in the next four
years, said now was the time to impose more financial
discipline.
 ""We'll enact the measures that we've agreed upon,"" Merkel
said in an interview with German ARD television broadcast on
Thursday. ""I believe we should not let up.""
 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, writing in
Handelsblatt newspaper, said he could not understand the
""implicit accusation"" that Germany was ""wrecking the recovery
with austerity measures"" because Berlin was doing a lot to
stimulate growth.
 After winning praise for steering the world economy through
the financial crisis, the G20 countries find themselves
struggling to keep a unified line on what comes next:
supporting still-shaky growth or cutting budget deficits.
 Markets are jittery about the soaring levels of debt in
many rich countries and the risk of an economic slowdown. The
cost of protecting government debt against default hit a record
high for Greece on Thursday and jumped in other peripheral
countries such as Portugal.
 ""FRAGILE"" RECOVERY
 The draft version of the Toronto summit communique, dated
June 11 and obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, said the recovery
was ""uneven and fragile"" and warned against complacency.
 ""Fiscal challenges in many states are creating market
volatility, and could seriously threaten the recovery and
weaken prospects for long-term growth,"" it said.
 President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, which currently
chairs the G20, said that while the global economy was
recovering, each country must seek to keep recovery on track
while developing its own ""concrete, reliable exit strategy.""
 ""But they also have to consider any subsequent ripple
effects that might spread through neighboring countries,"" Lee
told Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper.
 The United States has warned against withdrawing support
too soon, mindful of when the government slammed the brakes on
spending in the 1930s, prolonging the Great Depression.
 But Summers took a softer line on Thursday, dismissing talk
that the G20 leaders would clash over whether to push for
fiscal prudence or sustaining growth.
 ""I am sure there are people who will try to divert (the G20
leaders) into an argument about the brakes versus the
accelerators but I have never seen a car with only a brake or
an accelerator,"" Summers said.
 ""One of the first things they taught me...in my driver's ed
course was that, never, ever could you fail to look down the
road even as you are looking at what is right in front of
you.""
 The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged a
faltering pace of U.S. economic recovery as it renewed its vow
to hold benchmark interest rates exceptionally low for an
extended period. But it stuck to its expectation that the
economy will continue to gradually improve.
 BACKLASH AND BUDGET CUTS
 In Europe, a market backlash against countries seen to be
dragging their feet on cutting debt and deficits has sparked
budget cutbacks as governments try to rein in spending.
 French unions staged a nationwide strike on Thursday over
plans to reform the pension system following similar protests
in Spain and Greece, where ministers were due to meet on
Thursday to discuss their own pension reforms.
 Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado said she was
confident the minority government's budget would pass the
national parliament in September, when unions have also
scheduled a general strike.
 G20 leaders must also forge consensus on how to harmonise
financial regulatory reforms and ECB chief Trichet said he was
confident the G20 was on the right track.
 The G20 summit takes place in Toronto on Saturday and
Sunday. The group includes the world's biggest economies and
covers two-thirds of the world's population.
 It will be preceded by a meeting of the G8, composed of
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the
United States.

 * Says Commerce Department should decide soon on probes
(Adds more background and quotes)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - China's exchange rate
actions in coming weeks will determine whether the U.S.
Congress passes legislation to pressure Beijing to raise the
value of its currency, a top U.S. lawmaker said on Thursday.
 ""I think we need to keep that legislation on the burner. I
think whether we act on it will be affected by what China
does,"" House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Sander Levin told reporters.
 Bowing to pressure from the United States and other trading
partners, China announced Saturday that it was freeing its
closely managed currency from a two-year peg to the dollar.
 President Barack Obama's administration welcomed the move,
but many U.S. lawmakers want China to go further and raise the
value of the yuan against the dollar.
 They argue the yuan is still undervalued by as much as 25
percent to 40 percent, even with the recent reform.
 ""We'll see if China's action in this immediate period
really reflects a very significant change in policy. ... We
follow the yuan every day,"" Levin said.
 His comments came one day after Senator Charles Schumer, a
New York Democrat, said he would push for a vote in the Senate
on a bill opening the way for the Commerce Department to treat
China's currency policy as a subsidy under U.S. trade law.
 That would allow U.S. manufacturers, on a case-by-case
basis, to seek duties on imports from China that benefit from
the exchange rate.
 A group of House lawmakers are also pressing for vote on a
similar bill crafted by Democratic Representative Tim Ryan and
Republican Representative Tim Murphy.
 ""I think that essentially that bill will be under
continuing review and events will determine rather soon whether
we act on it,"" Levin said.
 Many lawmakers believe the Commerce Department already has
the legal authority to apply countervailing duties against
China's exchange rate.
 The Commerce Department has previously refused to
investigate the issue, but for the past several months has been
mulling whether to change that policy in two current cases
involving paper and aluminum products from China.
 Commerce Secretary Gary Locke told the Senate Finance
Committee on Wednesday the department had to proceed carefully
because of the potential for challenges both in U.S. courts and
the World Trade Organization.
 Levin said he believed the Obama administration was also
weighing the issue in the context of crafting the best overall
strategy to get China to revalue the yuan.
 ""How those complaints fit into that (strategy), I think
they need to determine in the next couple of weeks,"" Levin
said. ""I think that will be discussed in the very near
future between the administration and ourselves.""

 * Leaders eager to bolster trade
(updates after news conference)
 By Jeff Mason and Guy Faulconbridge
 WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev agreed on Thursday to
allow U.S. companies to restart exports of poultry to Russia as
the two leaders found common ground on trade and investment.
 Speaking to reporters after morning meetings with his
Russian counterpart, Obama said the United States supported
Moscow's bid to join the World Trade Organization and both men
said they hoped to have technical issues that have stymied that
effort to be resolved by the fall.
 ""To deepen Russia's integration into the global economy, I
reaffirmed our strong commitment to Russia's ascension to the
World Trade Organization,"" Obama said. ""Today, we've reached an
agreement that will allow the United States to begin exporting
our poultry products to Russia once again.""
 Obama is keen to bolster meager trade and investment with
Russia as a way to take its relationship with Moscow to a new
level after gaining Kremlin support over Afghanistan, Iran
sanctions and a landmark nuclear arms reduction treaty.
 Chicken became the two leaders' latest area of agreement.
 Russia had been the largest overseas buyer of U.S. chicken,
but banned the meat earlier this year, claiming a chlorine
rinse used here violated its food safety rules.
 Shares of top U.S. chicken producers Tyson Foods Inc
, Pilgrim's Pride Corp  and Sanderson Farms Inc
 turned higher after the announcement.
 The Obama administration has tried to engage the Kremlin in
warmer relations since taking office 18 months ago, after
relations between Washington and Moscow had deteriorated,
especially after Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia.
 Medvedev, who started his U.S. visit with a tour of
California's Silicon Valley high-technology companies, also met
U.S. business leaders to pitch Russia as a swiftly expanding
economy where investors are welcome.
 Thursday's meeting was the seventh between Obama and
Medvedev and officials on both sides are eager to underscore
their close personal ties.
 Obama treated Medvedev to a cheeseburger lunch at Ray's
Hell Burger outside of Washington. The two leaders shared
fries.
 That atmosphere, the officials say, contrasts with the
disputes of the Bush years, when relations sank to a
post-Soviet low during the war between Russia and U.S.-ally
Georgia.

 By Jennifer Ablan
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - World stock markets and
high-yielding currencies dropped on Thursday as investors
retreated from riskier assets, worried about tepid global
growth and renewed fears in Greek debt markets.
 U.S. Treasuries and gold prices rose as investors sought
safe havens.
 The Federal Reserve offered a subdued assessment of the
U.S. economy on Wednesday and affirmed that short-term
interest rates would remain near zero for ""an extended
period,"" which pressured U.S. equities for a second
consecutive day on Thursday.
 Investors also braced for legislators to wrap up
negotiations on the financial overhaul bill. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 111.44 points, or 1.08
percent, at 10,187.00, with financials among the worst
performers.
 Adding to the worry list, concerns over Greece were
weighing in the euro zone, as the cost of protecting its
government debt against default hit a record high.
 Five-year credit default swaps, or CDS, on Greek
government debt climbed to a record 1,085 basis points from
934.2 basis points at the New York close on Wednesday. It now
costs 1.085 million euros to insure an exposure of 10 million
euros of Greek government bonds, up from 934,200 euros.
 Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Omnivest Group
in Princeton, New Jersey, said, ""You're seeing risk trades
being taken off, given all that's up in the air right now.""
 Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's
Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio, added: ""There's still
uncertainty in the financial reform bill. Until that's
resolved and we have a more clear-cut idea of what's going to
happen, that uncertainty will probably lead to continued
relative weakness.""
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top
shares fell 1.83 percent, near its session low. Financial
stocks ranked among the top decliners, with Barclays ,
BNP Paribas , Credit Agricole  and Societe
Generale  down between 3.50 percent 4.50 percent.
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
<.MIWO00000PUS> were down for a third consecutive day, off
roughly 1 percent on Thursday.
 The index has fallen 5.9 percent this year, and carried a
one-year forward P/E of 11.9 versus a five-year average of
13.3, according to DataStream.
 FLIGHT TO FAVORITE HAVENS
 U.S. Treasury debt prices rose. The benchmark 10-year U.S.
Treasury note  was up 9/32, with the yield at 3.09
percent, while the 2-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
1/32, with the yield at 0.66 percent. The 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond  was up 8/32, with the yield at
4.0504 percent.
In currencies, the dollar was flat against a basket of
major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index
<.DXY> at 85.741 -- unchanged from Wednesday's close.
 The euro  was up 0.02 percent at $1.2315 from a
previous session close of $1.2313. Against the Japanese yen,
the dollar  was down 0.57 percent at 89.32 from a
previous session close of 89.830.
In energy and commodities prices, U.S. light sweet crude
oil  fell $1, or 1.31 percent, to $75.35 per barrel, and

points, or 0.30 percent, at 260.51.
 ""As the U.S. fiscal stimulus starts to wane, it brings
back the deflationary argument. Together with weak U.S. data,
there are reasons to be pessimistic and that cannot be a

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The yen rose against the
dollar and euro on Thursday as a less optimistic outlook on
growth from the U.S. Federal Reserve dented risk appetite, with
the single currency further hampered by Greek debt markets.
 Concerns over Greece hung over the euro zone as the cost of
protecting its government debt against default hit a record
high.
 U.S. economic reports on weekly initial jobless claims and
durable goods orders for May came in largely in line with
expectations and saw the dollar pare gains against the euro and
extend declines against the yen.
 The dollar came under pressure in Asian trading as
investors initially took the view the Fed's renewed pledge to
keep rates on hold for an extended period would be a positive
for the world economy.
 European investors chose to focus on the Fed's scaling back
of its assessment of the pace of recovery, leading them to buy
the yen.
 ""The outlook from the Fed was more negative for interest
rates and the economy than it was before,"" said Joseph
Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle
River, New Jersey. 
 In a statement at the end of a two-day meeting, the Fed
took note of pockets of weakness in the recovery, and also
issued a cautionary note about volatile markets in light of
Europe's debt woes.
 ""The concerns over peripheral Europe increased this
morning, and the market is more focused on that than U.S.
data,"" said Jessica Hoversen, a fixed income and currency
analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
 The euro was down 0.7 percent versus the yen at 109.82 yen.
The dollar fell 0.6 percent to 89.27 yen, after earlier hitting
a one-month low.
 The euro fell 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.2306,
having risen to $1.2351 in Asia. Traders reported demand at
$1.2270, which supported the downside though the session low
posted at $1.2263.
 Some of the euro's rally off session lows was for technical
reasons, said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT
in New York.
 Once the euro began gaining upside momentum, investors who
had bet against the euro were forced to buy the single currency
to prevent further losses, Schlossberg said.
 Sterling rose to a 19-month high versus the euro. British
assets were still being bolstered by Tuesday's tough budget,
which investors perceive as necessary to tackle a huge deficit
as fiscal worries plague the euro zone.
 The Aussie dollar reversed gains after rising as high as
$0.8771 after Australia's ruling Labor Party elected a new
prime minister in Julia Gillard, in a bid to avoid election
defeat later this year.
 Gillard immediately offered to end a bitter dispute over a
controversial ""super profits"" mining tax, saying she would
throw open the door for fresh negotiations. But she stressed
miners should pay more tax.
 The Aussie slipped back to trade down 1 percent on the day
at $0.8655.
 ""I expect the political developments in Australia to be
supportive for the Australian dollar, but today it's all about
the downturn in risk appetite,"" said Gavin Friend, currency
strategist at National Australia Bank.

 By Faith Hung
 TAIPEI, June 24 (Reuters) - Taiwan stocks will close the
year roughly where they are now, according to a Reuters poll, as
optimism over more flexible yuan policy is capped by concerns
the euro zone debt crisis could dent the global economy.
 The main TAIEX index was seen at 7,600 points by the end of
the year, around where it closed on Thursday. That is a
significant downgrade from the 8,500 predicted in a similar poll
taken three months ago.
 The TAIEX is now expected to rise to 8,000 by mid-2011,
according to the median forecast from 15 fund managers and
analysts.
 Some investors were worried that the euro zone debt crisis
would delay purchase of electronics products, denting profits of
the world's top two contract chip makers, TSMC and UMC.
 ""The momentum of corporate fundamentals would not have too
much excitement to look forward to,"" said analyst Alex Huang of
Mega Securities.
 Laptop PC makers Quanta and Compal and others that have
factories in China could see their costs rising after iPhone
maker Foxconn International's hubs in southern China were hit by
a spate of suicides.
 But analysts said a stronger yuan would help Taiwan firms
with large exposure to the mainland's huge home market.
 ""China's flexibility plan is a positive factor, attracting
foreign investors to Taiwan and other Asian financial markets,""
said Robert Hsieh, an assistant vice president of Shin Kong
Financial's fund unit.
 China's central bank earlier this week set the yuan's daily
mid-point at the highest level since its re-evaluation in July
2005, signaling it could allow the currency to rise further.

closely with Wal-Mart Stores in mainland China, said fund

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2010 10:38AM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-Cautious investors on top at half time," By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The investment winners at half
time, 2010, are those who have played catenaccio -- on the
defensive, seeking protection from risk -- and there is little
to suggest that this style will change much in the second half.
 Volatility, the predominant characteristic of the first six
months of the year, may calm down a bit and emerging markets
look set to pick up their role as market and economic drivers
again.
 But there are new threats on the horizon, particularly from
debt-ridden governments intent on cutting spending, that suggest
what has worked so far may do so again.
 Performance tables tell the tale.
 Snuggled near the top of Thomson Reuters fund tracker
Lipper's top equity performers, for example, is the RBC Global
Precious Metals Fund, returning around 11.5 percent
year-to-date.
 That compares with a loss of around 3.5 percent for equity
funds as a whole.
 But the RBC fund is only an equity fund in name. The
equities it buys are linked to metals, particularly gold, which
has gained around 13 percent this year, boosted by risk-averse
investors fearing fiscal deficits, slow economic growth and
government creation of a flood of liquidity to combat recession.
 ""If you are printing money around the world, that tends to
be positive for the price of gold,"" said Brahm Spilfogel,
co-manager of the fund, in Toronto.
 Moving over to balanced funds -- those that invest in a mix
of assets -- it is a similar story. The ones that have
outperformed tend to have been cautious in their choices.
 Legg Mason's Multi-Manager Balanced Fund, for example, is
near the top of Lipper's balanced fund performance table with a
return year-to-date of 1.34 percent versus a loss of 2.7 percent
on aggregate for balanced funds.
 The fund, however, had 52 percent of its assets in bonds
versus 45 percent for equities at of the beginning of May,
Lipper's latest data allocation data.
 So the message for the first six months of the year appears
to have been that outperformance comes with a healthy appetite
for assets that do well when people are nervous.
 
 BITE WORSE THAN BARK
 Looking ahead to the second half, not much is likely to
change unless the factors causing the first half's risk-aversion
are fixed.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve's comments this week tended to be
more cautious about the U.S. economy and while the debate is on
about whether there is a double-dip recession on the horizon,
economic data for the industrial world, at least, is suggesting
a slowing in recovery.
 And when it comes to the deficits and other fiscal issues
facing leading economies, there is growing concern that the
needed medicine may have unpleasant side effects.
 Attempts by governments such as those in Britain and Germany
to cut their fiscal debt have been applauded in thoery by
markets. But cutting spending also threatens the prospects for
recovering growth.
 Looking at Britain, for example, Michael Dicks, chief
economist at Barclays Wealth, reckons there is a danger that the
recent deficit-cutting budget will hurt short-term growth more
than the government estimates and that the longer-term rebound
could be less.
 He notes that fiscal multipliers used by the UK government
-- how much each 1 percent of GDP raised from tax rises and
spending cuts hits overall GDP -- are lower than those generally
used by economists.
 In a similar vein, U.S. fund firm JPMorgan Asset Management
points to a dilemma of government's having to act but doing so
at an inauspicious time.
 Noting that the size of public debt and deficits have become
unsustainable in leading economies, it says in a mid-year
outlook:
 ""To stabilise debt/GDP in much of the OECD requires a
sizeable fiscal tightening that could threaten recovery. This is
difficult and controversial at a time when global growth
indicators are rolling over.""
 Nothing in these views points to investors abandoning the
caution they have embraced during the first half.
 
 GAME OF TWO HALVES?
 That said, there are some signs that the second half could
be a bit less volatile for riskier assets than the first.
 For one thing, the global stock market correction that began
in mid-April -- a more than 17 percent dive from high to low on
the MSCI all-country world index -- has steadied if not clearly
reverse.
 Some investors are talking about finding value in stocks and
fund flows show appetite for emerging markets -- the one bright
spot in the world economy -- rising again after a dip.
 Median forecasts from over 300 strategists surveyed by
Reuters showed a much better half ahead, but with an emphasis on
emerging rather than developed markets.
 With current correlations between equities and other riskier
assets such as high yielding currencies being high, this may
have wider implications beyond stock markets.
 But the overall climate suggests that while the first half's
wilder volatility may ease, it will be a long way from smooth.
 Consider the thoughts of one of those who has made the best
of the past six months:
 ""The gold price in this environment will continue to go
sideways to higher,"" said RBC's Spilfogel, suggesting that the
worst he sees for his outperforming asset it to maintain what it
has already gained.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The dollar and yen rose
against the euro on Thursday as a less optimistic outlook on
growth from the U.S. Federal Reserve dented investors' appetite
for risk, with the euro further hampered by Greek debt
markets.
 Concerns over Greece were hanging over the euro zone, as
the cost of protecting its government debt against default hit
a record high.
 U.S. economic reports on weekly initial jobless claims and
durable goods orders for May came in largely in line with
expectations and saw the dollar pare gains against the euro and
extend declines against the yen.
 The dollar had come under pressure in Asian trading as
investors initially took the view that the Fed's renewed pledge
to keep rates on hold for an extended period would be a
positive for the world economy.
 But European investors chose to focus on the Fed's scaling
back of its assessment of the pace of recovery, leading them to
buy the yen and to a lesser extent, the dollar.
 ""The concerns over peripheral Europe increased this
morning, and the market is more focused on that than U.S.
data,"" said Jessica Hoversen, a fixed income and currency
analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
 In a statement at the end of a two-day meeting, the Fed
took note of pockets of weakness in the recovery, and also
issued a cautionary note about volatile markets in light of
Europe's debt woes.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent versus the dollar at $1.2286,
having risen to $1.2351 in Asia. Traders reported demand at
$1.2270, which supported the downside though the session low
posted at $1.2263.
 The euro was down 0.7 percent versus the yen at 109.86 yen.
The dollar fell 0.5 percent to 89.41 yen, after earlier hitting
a one-month low.
 Sterling rose to a 19-month high versus the euro. British
assets were still being bolstered by Tuesday's tough budget,
which investors perceive as necessary to tackle a huge deficit
as fiscal worries plague the euro zone.
 The Aussie dollar reversed gains after rising as high as
$0.8771 after Australia's ruling Labor Party elected a new

 * Signs that Brazil and India are willing to negotiate

(Adds details, quotes)
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 24 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization's
long-running Doha round is stuck and a deal is impossible until
China and other big emerging economies join real negotiations to
open their markets, the U.S. ambassador to the WTO said on
Thursday.
 The unusually outspoken comments were a sign of Washington's
frustration at the reluctance of China, Brazil and India --
among the most dynamic players in the world economy -- to create
more market opportunities to reach a deal in the talks.
 Ambassador Michael Punke said China was stalling on talks on
the global trade round sought by the United States, but there
were signs that Brazil and India were willing to negotiate.
 ""When it comes to China however we're getting no engagement
whatsoever, not even in terms of process,"" he told Reuters. ""We
find it very hard to see how it is we're going to be able to
move forward with Doha negotiations if China is not even in a
position right now to consult with its domestic industry.""
 Punke's comments added to pressure put on China on Wednesday
by his boss, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, and Commerce
Secretary Gary Locke.
 With G20 leaders expected to call in Toronto this weekend
yet again for a renewed push to conclude the Doha round, his
remarks highlight the difficulties in reaching an agreement.
 Punke dismissed arguments by the emerging giants that they
should not be asked to do more in the Doha talks, launched in
late 2001, because the liberalisation round was intended mainly
to help developing countries trade more.
 It was wrong to consider dynamos such as China, Brazil and
India, despite their millions of poor people, in the same light
as the poorest countries, he said. They would be among the main
beneficiaries of the global trading system after a Doha deal.
 
 BARRIERS
 ""Where are the barriers to developing country trade? The
most significant ones are in the emerging developing countries,""
he said, adding that 70 percent of tariffs collected by the
emerging economies were paid by developing countries.
 Punke also rejected warnings from other WTO members that
U.S. demands could cause the current carefully balanced
proposals to unravel.
 ""We don't have a deal right now,"" Punke said, saying that
current proposals, based on the state of negotiations in July
2008 when an attempt by ministers to reach a deal collapsed,
represented valuable work but were not the end of the story.
 Punke said that in the last few months WTO members had held
real talks in a number of groups, such as environmental goods,
trade in services led by Australia, and opening up individual
industrial sectors led by Japan. 
 ""We've had a useful and constructive process that we've
begun with India and Brazil. There's a process there that gives
me some hope that over time we can reach a good conclusion,"" he
said of the United States' bilateral negotiations.
 The United States appreciated that it would have to pay for
any further concessions from its partners.
 ""What we've said is that we believe that negotiations
involve a process of give and take and that we will evaluate all
requests for market access from the U.S. in the context of the
overall package that we're able to achieve,"" he said.
 The United States is seeking more access in particular for
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, forestry products,
and construction and agricultural equipment, making different
requests to different countries, Punke said.
 Comments by officials from the emerging powers that
Washington was demanding concessions on thousands of tariff
lines were misleading, he said. It had simply laid out a range
of areas where it was interested in negotiating and asked its
partners to indicate where it was worth holding talks, he said.
 The U.S. would accept any approach that led to negotiations.
 Given the time taken to negotiate and implement trade deals
the United States wants to ensure the rules agreed by the
emerging powers are realistic as it could be another 25 years
before the next set is in place.
 The current proposals would mean that India does not cut 97
percent of its industrial tariffs, Brazil could retain tariffs
of over 15 percent on more than 1,000 goods and China could
theoretically protect its entire car industry or most of its
chemical sector from opening, Punke said.

 * Majority think Nikkei bottomed out this month
 * Global recovery a boost; worries remain about euro zone
 
 By Elaine Lies
 TOKYO, June 24 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks are set to rise
13 percent by year-end as confidence in a global recovery grows,
but uncertainty about domestic economic policy and worries about
a flare-up of euro zone debt woes will limit gains.
 A majority of market participants in a Reuters poll also
said they thought the benchmark Nikkei index had bottomed out
this month when it fell to a six-month low.
 The consensus prediction for where the index would close the
year was virtually unchanged from the March Reuters poll despite
a change of government since then and renewed turmoil in
financial markets.
 ""The market is likely to be heading into a rebound as risks
to China's economy recede, while euro zone debt problems are not
expected to derail the global economy the way the Lehman shock
did,"" said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management.
 ""But as we get into next year we're likely to see interest
rate hikes as part of various countries' exit strategies, while
another euro zone debt problem can't be ruled out. This may lead
to a period of downward adjustment then,"" Akino said.
 The Nikkei is likely to end 2010 at 11,250, according to the
median forecast of 19 market participants polled by Reuters, and
claw its way up to 11,375 by the end of June 2011. A similar
poll in March predicted 11,000 at the end of this year.
 On Thursday, the Nikkei finished at 9,928.34. It rose to an
18-month high of 11,408.17 in April.
 Market players said more positive signs from China, such as
its decision to make the yuan more flexible, will likely feed
growing confidence about the global recovery, while mid-year
corporate earnings provide an additional boost.
 ""The world economy is improving, albeit slowly, and risk
avoidance will ebb. Immediate worries about European stocks have
eased and earnings will improve,"" said Hiroichi Nishi, general
manager at the equity division of Nikko Cordial Securities.
 ""Stocks are likely to rise until August and then they'll
probably take a breather in the fall. Then they'll recover back
to 12,000.""
 The range of forecasts in the poll suggested some confidence
about the outlook. The difference between the highest and the
lowest forecast for the Nikkei year-end close narrowed
considerably to 3,600 index points compared with 5,000 seen in
March. That range was 7,400 in the December 2009 poll.
 
 JAPAN ELECTION
 One big question for Japan over the next few months will be
its economic policies, with additional uncertainty coming with a
July 11 upper house election.
 Japan set ambitious targets to rein in its debt on Tuesday
but admitted they would not be met even under its rosiest growth
scenario, setting the stage for contentious tax hikes.
 ""We really need to watch what happens over the next month or
two with the Japanese government,"" said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief
equity market officer at Tokai Tokyo Securities.
 ""If we end up with a new government it could prompt selling
from foreign investors.""
 Longer-term views were divided, with some saying further
confirmation that the global economy has improved will keep
shares climbing next year, mainly on expectations of earnings
improving another notch.
 The spectre of more European debt problems looms as well,
especially among those market players who said they thought the
Nikkei has yet to bottom out.
 ""The Nikkei often hits its year's high in April and then
falls to its lows in October or November, which I think will
take place this year too, perhaps even break below 9,000,"" said
Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.
 ""I think the cause could be European debt problems.""

 * Stocks still facing headwinds
 By Blaise Robinson
 PARIS, June 24 (Reuters) - Strong company profits should
eclipse euro zone sovereign debt worries to send France's CAC 40
around 1.6 percent higher before the end of 2010, a Reuters poll
found, reversing losses suffered in the first half.
 The CAC 40 was seen at 4,000 points by end-2010, up from
3,939 at the end of 2009 and 9.8 percent higher from Wednesday's
close at 3,642, according to the median forecast of around 28
analysts and fund managers.
 That was down from the 4,200 level forecast in the March
poll. The latest poll also saw the CAC 40 at 4,200 points by
mid-2011, up 15 percent from Wednesday's close.
 France's blue-chip index, in which influential stocks
include multinationals such as Danone, Total and LVMH, is down
7.48 percent so far this year, hit by concerns the euro zone
debt crisis could derail the region's economic recovery.
 ""Companies' balance sheets are very healthy and we should
normally be heading for even stronger gains on the market, but
it's a fact that economic growth will be sluggish as countries
struggle to deal with their debt,"" said Christian Jimenez, fund
manager and president of Diamant Bleu.
 He sees the CAC 40 at 4,000 points at the end of the year,
and at 4,200 in mid-2011.
 Following a mixed first quarter, the CAC 40 started to sink
in mid-April, hurt by fears that Greece's debt woes could spread
to other countries such as Spain and Portugal, sending the euro
currency to a four-year low against the dollar.
 Paris's benchmark index plummeted nearly 20 percent during
the spring sell-off that hit stocks around the world, but the
index managed to bounce back over the past two weeks, recouping
some of the losses as debt worries moved to the back burner and
investors scooped up battered shares, whose valuation ratios had
fallen to levels not seen in nearly a year.
 The recent fall in the euro is also seen by analysts and
fund managers as a balm for French companies, especially the
ones with a big chunk of their revenues coming from abroad.
 But a number of analysts warned that the market still faces
major headwinds.
 ""With all the fiscal austerity measures that will weigh on
growth in the euro zone, we expect negative surprises on the
earnings front and profit forecasts for 2011 will be trimmed,
which in turn will prompt more losses on the stock market,"" said
Philippe-Henri Burlisson, core management director of Groupama
Asset Management.
 Domestic-orientated companies also have a sword of Damocles
over their heads, Burlisson said, as the government could start
raising corporate tax rates to plug holes in its budget.
 ""These domestic-oriented sectors will face increasing fiscal
pressure,"" said Burlisson, who sees the CAC 40 at 3,400 points
at the end of the year, and at 3,500 points at mid-2011.

mid-2011
 * Only three of 11 respondents say benchmark has troughed
 * Worries mount over economic growth, policy outlook key
 * Yuan appreciation to support market, but rise seen gradual
 
 By Yixin Chen and Edmund Klamann
 SHANGHAI, June 24 (Reuters) - Shanghai shares will see only
slight gains this year, as worries mount over the economy due to
the euro zone debt crisis and steps to cool property prices, a
Reuters poll found.
 But the survey of 13 analysts, mostly based in China, found
the longer-term outlook is slightly brighter on hopes for policy
shifts, including yuan reforms.
 China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index will rise a
modest 5 percent by year-end and 9 percent by the middle of next
year, according to the poll conducted June 18-23.
 The poll forecast the index would end the year at 2,700
points, with most respondents saying it had not yet hit bottom,
even after recent falls to more than one-year lows. On Thursday
the index closed at 2,567.
 The consensus is for a rise back to 2,800 points by the
middle of next year but five of 13 respondents said it would be
lower in the middle of 2011 than where it will end this year.
 ""The full effects of the euro zone debt crisis have not yet
completely emerged and the global economy will face a
double-dip,"" said Founder Securities analyst Fang Jiang.
 ""Domestic economic growth will also slow and macroeconomic
policies including property policies are not yet very clear.""
 The benchmark has fallen 21 percent so far this year, making
Shanghai one of the world's worst-performing stock markets.
 The bulk of those losses came in April and May as the
government launched a series of measures to cool the overheated
property market, fearing the potential damage from a price
bubble.
 Only three of the respondents said that the index had
already troughed, although half of the remaining eight thought
it would hit bottom by early in the fourth quarter.
 The market has struggled to find a floor as uncertainty
lingered over the outlook for property and monetary policies,
while the euro zone crisis has cast a shadow over economic
growth.
 ""With the economy slowing the index may remain weak,"" said
Zheng Weigang, analyst at Shanghai Securities. ""We are waiting
for changes in government policy and fund flows.""
 Also weighing on sentiment have been worries about an influx
of share supplies from massive fundraising plans by China's big
banks, including an imminent initial public offering by
Agricultural Bank of China in Shanghai and Hong Kong that is
likely to be the world's largest ever.
 China's decision to abandon the yuan's peg to the dollar,
setting the stage for the currency to appreciate, is expected to
give a lift to the stock market where exporters have faded in
importance.
 But the yuan rise will likely be only gradual in the initial
stages.
 ""For this year, China will be very cautious about yuan
appreciation, but the next cycle of the market rebound will be
closely linked to the yuan's appreciation,"" said Li Yaming,
analyst at Changjiang Securities.
 Other analysts also sounded an upbeat tone on the policy
outlook.
 ""The market may reflect the most pessimistic expectations,
for a double dip in the economy,"" said Wen Lijun, analyst at
Nanjing Securities.
 ""An economic slowdown will gradually show up in future data
and trigger a negative reaction. But flexible adjustments by the
authorities on macro policies can avoid the negative outcome of
a double-dip in the economy, and this could spur a market
rebound.""

 HONG KONG, June 24 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks are likely

 China broke its dollar peg on Saturday, which had been a

this year on fears China could take steps to cool its red-hot
property sector. Of the 22 polled, 17 said they felt the stock
market had already hit its trough for the year. One said the
index will end the year at 18,000.
 The index's 5 percent decline so far this year was less than
that of peers the Shanghai Composite Index and Taiwan's TAIEX
index, as investors used Hong Kong as a proxy to bet on the
broader Chinese economy.
 Hong Kong's price-to-earnings ratio, about 15 according to
Thomson Reuters data, is also lower than Shanghai's 16.8 and the
S&P 500's 16.2, prompting some of those polled to say that
shares were undervalued.
 ""The Hang Seng Index is now fairly priced, and not
expensive,"" said Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai
Securities. ""Global interest rates will remain at current
historical low levels for a period of time, which will help lift
financial markets.""

 * Trade practised through age-old hawala system
 * Middle East ""hedge"" to European markets
 
 By Thomas Grove
 ISTANBUL, June 24 (Reuters) - Money changers in the shadow
of Istanbul's historic Grand Bazaar hand Turkish exporters cash
sent from Iran. Trucks and vans ferry textiles and small
machinery across the frontier into the Islamic Republic.
 While the West cracks down on commerce with Iran, Turkey's
burgeoning breed of small businessmen, the 'Anatolian Tigers',
is quietly building a new trade bridge to the Middle East. 
 In these bustling Istanbul sidestreets Turkish and Iranian
traders carry on the age-old Islamic hawala system of money
transfer, relying more on trust rather than written records.
 ""With the hawala, trust is very important for business, and
it's there in our relationship with the Iranians,"" said Ozan
Ziylan, who oversees exports of several companies within
Turkey's private MLS Holding from his Istanbul office.
 Relations between Turkey and Iran reached new heights
earlier this month when the NATO member and EU aspirant voted
against U.S.-led United Nations sanctions on Iran over its
nuclear programme, arguing such steps only hampered diplomacy.
 That decision may have cost Ankara some capital among
western allies, including U.S. political and military leaders
who see Turkey, still, as a diplomatic bridgehead to the Middle
East with all its complexities.
 But Ankara's unprecedented warming with Iran in recent years
has made billions of dollars for the Anatolian Tigers, so named
for their preponderance in the hinterland of central Anatolia.
 Trade has been growing ever since the AK Party of Prime
Minister Tayyip Erdogan swept to power eight years ago.
 The AK Party considers itself a Muslim version of Western
Europe's Christian Democrat parties, conservative on social
issues and liberal on economic ones.
 The AK Party's detractors accuse it of Islamist leanings,
and often point to Turkey's deepening ties with governments that
the West doesn't trust as a sign of where its inclinations lie.
 Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution the influential army has
regarded Tehran as the biggest threat to the secular state.
 
 BUSINESS, DIPLOMACY AND POLITICS
 This year, Iran is likely to be the 12th largest customer
for Turkish exports, purchasing mostly chemicals, textiles, and
machinery from small and medium-sized businesses across Turkey.
 In 2009, Turkey exported $2.025 billion worth of goods to
the Islamic Republic, up more than 500 percent from $334 million
in 2002, when the AK Party took power.
 Business is also increasing with Syria, with which Turkey
came to the brink of armed conflict as recently as 1998, and
Iraq, where easing political relations in the Kurdish north are
also opening up markets for Turkey.
 The implications are broad. A new throughdraft of trade
across eastern frontiers that have too long constituted a
virtual commercial dead-end could also ease a poverty in the
Turkish southeast that has helped fuel Kurdish separatism.
 ""It's the formation of a capital base to correspond to a
foreign policy that's been a long time coming,"" said Mehmet
Besimoglu, economist at Istanbul-based Oyak Invest.
 The European Union is by far the main buyer of Turkish goods
and the biggest investor here, and it is likely to remain so,
but analysts see the government looking to diversify ties.
 ""Considering low growth and other risks (in Europe) the
government might be trying to find a hedge for themselves,"" said
Besimoglu.
 Turkey's increasing focus on the East has caused concern
among some western policy makers that European Union-oriented
reforms may fall by the wayside.
 But those eastern ties also,a rguably, strengthen the
country's strategic credentials and value as a western ally.
 ""If you're pro-Turkey and you look at it as a strategic
country, you see the benefits in Ankara starting dialogues with
different countries, rather than trying to isolate them,"" said
Wolfango Piccoli of Eurasia Group.
 Turkey has always sold itself to sceptics in the EU just so;
as a political and commercial bridge to the Middle East. 
 
 GAS
 Last year, nearly 20 percent of Turkey's exports went to the
Middle East in 2009, with sales of $19.2 billion, compared with
12.5 percent in 2004. Turkey's political profile under Erdogan
has worked to his favour, overcoming, at least for now, residual
suspicions rooted in the history of Turkish Ottoman rule.
 Turkey's relationship with Iran is a special case.
 Ankara's biggest fear surrounding sanctions on Tehran is
that it may turn the tap on the billions of dollars of gas it
buys from Iran every year, some 10 billion cubic metres, or
nearly a third of its gas supplies.
 For now the uncertainty born of the sanctions climate means
Turkish exporters reap rewards for going where others, fearing
the heat of Western governments, cannot go or fear to go.
 Iran is a hop across the border for a small businessman here.
The road from Duesseldorf, London or Paris is more tortuous.
 ""European firms, they don't like to export to Iran because
of the sanctions,"" said M. Tolga Tuncel, product manager at Acar
Chemicals.
 ""They have less of a chance and we are closer, so we have
strengthened our position in the market,"" he said in his office
overlooking blue vats of chemicals used to make adhesives.
 The hawala money transfer system, used by some 40 percent of
Turkish exporters to Iran, lacks paper records and raises the
risk of illegal and black market trade, says exporter Ziylan.
 Ankara, though, is a at pains to deny any suggestion it
would tolerate breaches of U.N. sanctions.
 Ziylan said he had stopped selling oil products to the
Islamic Republic, but is eagerly awaiting the next order for
machine parts from Tehran.
 Erdogan's support for the Palestinian cause and harsh
criticism of once close ally Israel following a deadly Israeli
commando raid on a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza last month
has raised Turkey's prestige in the Muslim world.
 Businessmen get a warmer welcome when they visit Turkey's
neighbours.
 ""There is a major difference in the way we are treated in
Syria or Iran with the way it was two years ago,"" said Ziylan.
 ""Now they call us brothers.""

 * Eurozone crisis, BP, China currency all examples
 * Political news more closely watched, drives volatility
 * Divisions between emerging, developed markets break down
 
 By Peter Apps, Political Risk Correspondent
 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - Not so long ago, political risk
was mostly regarded as a hazard in emerging but not developed
markets, except perhaps for trading in oil and other commodities
sourced from perceived ""dangerous"" places.
 But since the crash of 2008, political news has fast become
a key driver in developed markets. Investors in the world's most
advanced economies are having to adapt.
 ""Political risk everywhere"", proclaimed the title of a
Goldman Sachs research note this month.
 ""In G7 economies, people used to think you could just
concentrate on the numbers,"" said Commerzbank head of emerging
markets research Michael Ganske. ""Now that has changed. You just
can't ignore the politics.""
 Ganske says his colleagues covering mainstream economies now
increasingly ask his team for their insight on Western Europe.
 The euro zone debt debacle, China's face-off with the United
States over currency and trade, and London-based BP's 
disastrous oil spill are all examples of political risk to
assets in developed countries.
 The global financial crisis boosted the market impact of
politics in several ways.
 It created short-term dependence on government stimulus that
in turn focused market attention on sovereign risk, highlighted
global imbalances and the rise of emerging powers, particularly
China, and fuelled populism and unrest worldwide.
 Whether fringe euro zone countries such as Greece and Spain
default depends on how far they can reduce spending and continue
to access international markets. 
 That leaves investors asking two questions: can governments
push through required cuts despite domestic resistance, and will
core Eurozone states, particularly Germany, underwrite the debt
if necessary? Neither have easy answers.
 ""The European spike is going to be with us for a few years
yet,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy
Eurasia Group. ""The austerity required is long-term and requires
a level of coordination that rises above the institutional
weaknesses of the euro zone.""
 Euro zone research notes are now dominated by talk of
Spanish union negotiations, German local elections and the
viability of ruling coalitions -- all issues financial analysts
covering the region largely ignored until recently.
 
 QUICKER THAN EVER
 Political events in countries of particular investor focus,
such as a violent demonstration in Greece in May that killed
three people, can affect markets worldwide. The sheer
uncertainty is undermining the euro .
 At the same time, markets are intruding into the region's
politics more than ever before. Few politicians believe voters
would reward them for a bond market crash.
 How to address non-euro zone member Britain's record deficit
and placate bond markets dominated a May election campaign, set
the timetable for the coalition negotiations, cemented an
improbable centre-right coalition and has driven budget cuts.
 ""There is a heightened sense that markets will move on news
more quickly than ever,"" said Jeffrey Garten, professor of
international trade, finance and business at Yale School of
Management. ""This, of course, is a trend that accelerates
itself, as everyone anticipates what everyone else is doing.""
 The rise of political risk is not confined to Europe. For
investors focused on the global economy, U.S.-China tension
particularly over Beijing's currency peg has long been key.
 China's decision to allow greater currency flexibility
helped feed a global market rally earlier this week and was
officially welcomed by the United States, but President Barack
Obama is under growing domestic pressure to take a tougher line.
 With mid-term elections looming in November and the economy
still subdued, U.S. politics is taking a more populist tone.
That is seen fuelling more aggressive action against banks and
particularly BP for the duration of the oil spill crisis.
 Bank shares have been buffeted by political events since
before 2008, with investors looking at how much government
support is available and how harsh regulatory and punitive
measures might be.
 BP's Gulf Coast experience -- together with mining tax hikes
in Canada and Australia -- remind investors in extractive
industries that developed countries can be just as tough to deal
with as emerging nations for foreign firms.
 Indeed, some analysts argue political risk is in some ways
less deceptive in emerging markets.
 
 QUESTIONING ENTIRE STRUCTURE?
 ""All countries are risky,"" said Ashmore head of research
Jerome Booth in a research note. ""Emerging markets are those
where this risk is priced in. Developed countries are where
investors do not perceive their own risk.""
 Any suggestion of emerging markets were truly decoupled from
developed ones was shattered after the Lehman failure. Emerging
stocks lost more heavily than their mainstream counterparts --
although they also bounced back faster.
 But Commerzbank's Ganske says investors have become more
discriminating. A decade ago, this year's violence in Kyrgyzstan
might have prompted a rise in risk aversion across the region.
 Instead, while it slashed the stockmarket value of several
small western mining companies exposed there, there was little
knock-on effect on Kazakhstan or other Central Asian states.
 Compared to many emerging economies, Greek debt now costs
much more to insure in the credit default swaps market, its
credit rating is lower and bond yields higher.
 ""Until last year, investors would have classed Polish debt
in one risk category and Greek debt in another because it was
euro zone,"" said Ganske. ""But now, they are looking at the real
underlying credit risk.""
 Some analysts suggest the new focus on developed world
politics might only last a couple of years before markets
refocus their attention and governments go back to sustainable
spending. Others suggest it could be much longer.
 ""My sense is that we have not been through this since the
1974 oil embargo, when the world really seems to be in the
process of unprecedented economic change and western governments
were helpless,"" said Yale's Garten. ""For the most part, the
period since World War II has been pretty steady until now.
Sure, there were crises but no one was really questioning the
entire political structure. Now they are.""

 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The United States and Europe
must take ""serious steps"" on fiscal consolidation to ensure the
world economy returns to strong growth, Russia's deputy finance
minister said on Thursday, staking out Moscow's position ahead
of a G20 summit.
 The weekend meeting of the Group of 20 leading economies is
expected to pit European calls for fiscal austerity against U.S.
warnings that spending curbs threaten an already fragile
recovery in global demand.
 ""We think without fiscal consolidation it will not be
possible to have strong economic growth,"" Deputy Finance
Minister Dmitry Pankin told reporters at a Euromoney investment
conference in London.
 ""Our position is that countries should take serious steps in
fiscal consolidation, especially Europe and the U.S.""
 In a letter released before this week's G20 summit, U.S.
President Barack Obama said public finance problems should be
addressed in the medium term -- effectively warning that fiscal
discipline should not be carried out at the expense of economic
recovery. 
 However, faced with a euro zone debt crisis, several
European nations, including Germany, are focused on cutting
ballooning deficits.
 Despite higher state spending, Russia is aiming for a lower
budget deficit this year on the back of higher oil prices,
targeting a shortfall of 5.4 percent of GDP instead of an
originally planned 6.8 percent.
 Pankin also said the recent volatility of the euro would not
prompt Russia to change the composition of its foreign-currency
reserves, saying the country had benefited somewhat from the
currency's recent weakness.
 ""All this turbulence doesn't mean that when the euro goes
down we need to diminish reserves in euros. We take a long-term
approach in reserves,"" he said.
 The euro has fallen by around 14 percent against the dollar
this year. Shifts in major central banks' policy on how they
divide up their hard currency reserves are one factor watched
closely by the market and Russia has among the world's largest,
swollen by oil dollars over the past decade.
 Pankin said also said a weaker euro wasn't entirely negative
for Russia.
 ""There are some advantages for Russia as our major exports
oil and gas are in dollars and major imports are in euros. So
there are some advantages in terms of trade. But the instability
means less flows for investors.""

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The dollar pared losses and the
yen rose on Thursday, as a less optimistic outlook on growth
from the U.S. Federal Reserve dented investors' appetite for
risk, while the euro was hampered by Greek debt markets.
 The dollar had come under some pressure in Asian trade, as
investors initially took the view that the Fed's renewed pledge
to keep rates on hold for an extended period would be a positive
for the world economy.
 But European investors chose to focus on the Fed's scaling
back of its assessment of the pace of recovery, leading them to
buy the yen and to a lesser extent, the dollar.
 ""As the U.S. fiscal stimulus starts to wane, it brings back
the deflationary argument. Together with weak U.S. data, there
are reasons to be pessimistic and that cannot be a positive
environment for risk,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
National Australia Bank.
 By 1051 GMT, the dollar index, which tracks the performance
of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies,
was up 0.1 percent at 85.864. It had earlier fallen to 85.595.
 ""The dollar pick-up was purely on rising risk aversion,""
said Christian Lawrence, currency strategist at RBC Capital
Markets.
 In a statement at the end of a two-day meeting, the Fed took
note of pockets of weakness in the recovery, and also issued a
cautionary note about volatile markets in light of Europe's debt
woes.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent versus the dollar at $1.2285,
having risen to $1.2351 in Asia. Traders reported semi-official
demand at $1.2270, which supported the downside.
 
 BUDGET FOCUS
 Concerns over Greece were hanging over the euro zone, as the
cost of protecting its government debt against default hit a
record high.
 The euro was down 0.8 percent versus the yen at 109.76 yen
as European stocks traded with losses of around 0.8 percent and
U.S. stock futures were down 0.6 percent, pointing to a lower
Wall Street open.
 The yen also rose against the dollar, hitting a one-month
high at 89.26 yen. 
 Sterling rose to a 19-month high versus the euro. British
assets were bolstered on Tuesday by a tough budget seen taking
the necessary action to tackle a huge deficit as fiscal worries
plague the euro zone.
 The Aussie dollar reversed gains after rising as high as
$0.8771 after Australia's ruling Labor Party elected a new prime
minister in Julia Gillard, in a bid to avoid election defeat
later this year.
 Gillard immediately offered to end a bitter dispute over a
controversial ""super profits"" mining tax, saying she would throw
open the door for fresh negotiations. But she stressed miners
should pay more tax.
 The Aussie slipped back to trade down 0.5 percent on the day
at $0.8690, weighed by the outlook for risk.
 ""I expect the political developments in Australia to be
supportive for the Australian dollar, but today it's all about
the downturn in risk appetite,"" National Australia Bank's Friend
said.

 * Private investment seen beneficial, differs from govt aims
 * Survey results due within next month 
 
 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - A recent global surge in private
investment in farmland is set to continue as investors look to
returns from agricultural production and to rising land values,
said an OECD executive on Thursday.
 An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) survey found that investment funds in this space are
growing and that the surge is not just a bubble, Wayne Jones,
head of the organisation's agro-food trade and market division,
told Reuters on the sidelines of an agricultural conference.
 The OECD, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation and other institutions have been developing
guidelines for international farmland investment after a wave of
deals in the past two years led to accusations that wealthier
nations have been staging a land grab.
 A spike in agricultural commodity prices in 2007-2008 led to
unrest in parts of the world and prompted countries such as
China, Saudi Arabia and South Korea to invest in farmland abroad
to improve their access to food supplies.
 The OECD survey of around 25 funds buying farmland in
regions including Latin America, Europe and Asia found they
brought much needed investment into the sector, said Jones.
 Jones differentiated between private investments, which
produce food to sell on domestic and international markets, and
government investments, which are designed for export to foreign
populations.
 ""In the case where you've got investors putting money into
companies that have developed land portfolios ... I think that's
quite a good thing for the host countries,"" he said.
 ""What we've seen is that it takes land which is perhaps not
productive, making it productive with major investments. Because
they (the investors) have access to capital, they increase
output, productivity, often reducing environmental damage and
they create employment for local areas,"" Jones said.
 The survey results are due to be published within the next
month, he added.

are reasons to be pessimistic and that cannot be a positive
environment for risk,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
National Australia Bank.
 At 0910 GMT, the dollar was trading up around 0.2 percent on
the day at 85.905 versus a currency basket, having earlier
fallen to 85.595.
 ""The FOMC statement last night was somewhat less optimistic
on growth than previously and noted that ""underlying inflation
has trended lower"". We are a long way from tightening in the US,
or any of the other G4 economies,"" Barclays analysts said in a
note to clients.
 In a statement at the end of a two-day meeting, the Fed
scaled back its assessment of the pace of recovery, taking note
of pockets of weakness, and also issued a cautionary note about
volatile markets in light of Europe's debt woes.
 The euro traded with losses of around 0.3 percent versus the
dollar at $1.2275 having risen to $1.2351 in Asia. Traders
reported semi-official demand at $1.2270.
 ""If the market was hoping for re-assurance from the FOMC
they would soon be disappointed as the Federal Reserve signalled
that growth was likely to disappoint over the course of the next
12 months, due in no small part from the problems in Europe,""
said Michael Hewson, currency analyst at CMC Markets.
 Concerns over Greece were hanging over the euro zone, as the
cost of protecting its government debt against default hit a
record high.
 The euro was down around 0.6 percent versus the yen at
109.95 yen as European stocks traded with losses of around 0.85
percent and US equity futures looked set for a negative open.
 The yen also rose against the dollar, hitting a one-month
high at 89.50 yen. 
 
 NEW AUSTRALIAN PM
 The Aussie dollar reversed gains after rising as high as
$0.8771 after Australia's ruling Labor Party elected a new prime
minister in Julia Gillard, in a bid to avoid election defeat
later this year.
 Gillard immediately offered to end a bitter dispute over a
controversial ""super profits"" mining tax, saying she would throw
open the door for fresh negotiations. But she stressed miners
should pay more tax.
 The Aussie slipped back to trade down 0.5 percent on the day
at $0.8695, weighed by the outlook for risk.
 ""I expect the political developments in Australia to be
supportive for the Australian dollar, but today it's all about
the downturn in risk appetite,"" National Australia Bank's Friend
said.
 Sterling rose to a 19-month high versus the euro as
Tuesday's tough budget in the UK was seen taking the necessary
action to tackle Britain's fiscal deficit, in contrast to the
nagging fiscal worries plaguing the euro zone.

 BRUSSELS, June 24 (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial new
orders rose in April at their fastest annual pace in 10 years,
data showed on Thursday, as an export-driven economic recovery
continued despite tension in the currency area's debt markets.
 Industrial new orders in the 16-country zone gained 0.9
percent month-on-month and 22.1 percent year-on-year, European
Union statistics office Eurostat said.
 They surged by a revised 5.1 percent month-on-month in
March, a small downward correction from the previous reading,
highlighting partly the collapse of industrial activity in early
2009 during the worst economic crisis in decades.
 ""It's quite a good reading. After the surge we have seen in
the month of March, this is really another strong report. And it
suggests the manufacturing sector is still on a really good
recovery path,"" said Juergen Michels, economist at Citigroup.
 The annual rise was the steepest since May 2000 and bigger
than the 21.5 percent expected on average by analysts polled by
Reuters. They had forecast a 1.6 percent month-on-month gain.
 The data reinforced a positive picture for manufacturers,
driven by demand from abroad and a weakening euro, while
domestic economies struggle. Industrial orders point to trends
in activity as they translate into production in coming months.
 But in May the euro area was hit by a sovereign debt crisis
linked to Greece's budget deficit problems, which analysts say
might have hit the real economy.
 Without volatile orders for ships, planes and trains, the
monthly increase in April was 1.1 percent and the year-on-year
jump 23.1 percent.
 Orders in the euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, rose 3.3
percent on the month and surged 32.4 percent year-on-year.
 Italy and the Netherlands also had growth in industrial
orders in April, but Spain and France suffered declines.
Orders for durable consumer goods in the euro zone fell 0.9
percent on the month and rose only 11.2 percent annually.
 ""This highlights the fact that the consumer has been a
persistent weak link in the euro zone's overall limited recovery
since exiting recession in the third quarter of 2009,"" said
Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight.
 The European Commission forecast last month that the
currency area's economy would expand by 0.9 percent this year,
after shrinking 4.1 percent in 2009.
 Eurostat said that in the wider 27-nation European Union,
industrial new orders fell 0.2 percent in April compared with
March and rose 21.8 percent annually.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2010 05:38AM ET</span>",Euribor market interest rates at new 8-month highs," FRANKFURT, June 24 (Reuters) - Key euro-priced bank-to-bank
lending rates hit their highest levels in eight months on
Thursday, as the region's debt crisis continued to hit
confidence and money markets prepare for a 442 billion euro
payback deadline.
 The three-month Euribor rate  -- traditionally
the main gauge of interbank euro lending and a mix of interest
rate expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- rose to
0.742 percent from 0.739 percent, the highest level since
mid-October.
 Six-month rates  rose to 1.027 percent from
1.024 percent, having broken through the ECB's benchmark
interest rate level of 1.0 percent two weeks ago for the first
time since last November. 
 One-year rates  were steady at 1.296 percent, a
new nine-month high, while shorter-term one-week rates
 rose to 0.388 percent from 0.381 percent and hit
the highest level this year.
 The debt troubles hitting Greece and other financially
strained euro-zone countries have reignited fears about region's
banks and forced the European Central Bank to reintroduce extra
lending operations and abandon a long-held resistance to buying
government bonds. [ID:nSGE65A02M]
 Markets are also bracing themselves for July 1, when banks
have to pay back 442 billion euros worth of one-year loans
borrowed from the ECB last year, although they will have the

 * Yuan reform won't sway China's interest rate moves
 * Don't politicise trade deficit, Beijing tells Washington
 By Chen Min and Ben Blanchard
 BEIJING, June 24 (Reuters) - The yuan is likely to rise
about 3 percent against the dollar by the end of this year,
assuming the euro holds its ground against the U.S. currency,
Li Daokui, a central bank adviser, said on Thursday.
 ""If the euro stabilises at the current level, there will be
modest yuan appreciation against the dollar. It's reasonable to
see appreciation of about 3 percent, or less, by the end of
this year,"" Li, one of three academic members of the People's
Bank of China's monetary policy advisory committee, told
Reuters.
 But Li played down the extent of the yuan's possible rise,
which he said would depend in part on the health of the
international economy. The fact that China had restored
exchange rate flexibility was of greater significance, he said.
 ""I want to stress that the degree of appreciation is not
important. The important thing is that the process (of currency
reform) has resumed,"" Li, an economics professor at Tsinghua
University in Beijing, said. The PBOC said on Saturday that
it would once again let the yuan move more freely after having
kept the currency more or less pegged to the dollar for two
years to provide stability for exporters during the global
downturn.
 CURRENCY TENSIONS
 Taking a long-term view, Li said he expected the yuan to
rise in value given China's productivity growth and strong
balance of payments surplus.
 But Li said freeing up the yuan was unlikely to trigger big
inflows or outflows of capital.
 Asked whether de-pegging the yuan would affect domestic
interest rate decisions, Li said the process of setting rates
was not directly linked with exchange rate movements.
 He said the key consideration was domestic inflation, and,
indirectly, a more flexible exchange rate would help tame
inflation.
 The yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), hovered around
6.81 per dollar on Thursday, representing a rise of just 0.25
percent since the long-awaited policy shift.
 U.S. senators said on Wednesday they were unmoved by
China's steps to partly free the yuan and vowed to push forward
legislation to punish what they see as an unfair undervaluation
of the currency that distorts trade and steals jobs.
 For its part, China's Foreign Ministry restated Beijing's
view that the yuan's exchange rate is not to blame for
America's large trade deficit with China.
 ""The United States should not politicise the renminbi
issue,"" spokesman Qin Gang told a regular news briefing. ""The
renminbi's appreciation or depreciation cannot basically solve
the imbalances in Sino-U.S. trade.""
 President Barack Obama will hold bilateral talks with
President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of a summit of the Group
of 20 leading nations in Canada this weekend.
 The value of the yuan, a lightning rod for tensions between
the two capitals, is likely to be discussed.
 ""We hope the U.S. can take a closer look at itself,
especially at its economic structure, instead of blindly
criticising and putting pressure on China,"" Qin said.
 For instance, one of the main reasons for the large two-way
trade deficit was U.S. controls on high-tech exports, he said.
 ""China does not intentionally seek a large trade surplus
with the United States. Over the past few years we have always
been taking proactive measures to increase exports from the
U.S. The measures have been significant and effective,"" Qin
added.

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - Global equities and crude prices
eased on Thursday on concerns over economic growth after the
U.S. Federal Reserve's pessimistic outlook, though the dollar
recovered from the previous session's losses.
 Concerns over Greece were hanging over the euro zone, as the
cost of protecting its government debt against default hit a
record high.
 The Fed acknowledged a faltering pace of U.S. economic
recovery on Wednesday as it renewed its vow to hold benchmark
interest rates exceptionally low for an extended period.
[ID:nN22150078
 Its assessment followed data showing that sales of new homes
in the United States fell to their lowest level ever in May and
came with Europe still on the path of austerity to prevent a
Greek-style debt crisis.
""The negative tone on the speed and strength of the recovery
from the Federal Reserve is infringing on investor's
expectations and there's a sense that there will be a long
period of anaemic growth,"" said Henk Potts, analyst at Barclays
Wealth in London.
 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 fell for the third day, down 0.9
percent and basic resources shares shed 1.8 percent, shrugging
off hopes new Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard could
compromise on a controversial mining tax.
 The European basis resources sector carried a one-year
forward price-to-earnings of 11.37, in line with its five-year
average of 11.34, according to Thomson Reuters DataStream.
 World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index
drifted 0.1 percent lower, down for a third consecutive day.
 The index has fallen 5.9 percent this year, and carried a
one-year forward P/E of 11.9 versus a five-year average of 13.3,
according to DataStream.
 U.S. stock index futures lost 0.6-0.7 percent, indicating a
weaker start for Wall Street, ahead of U.S.
durable goods data and weekly jobless claims.
 In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei average was flat as short-covering
petered out, with charts showing further gains were likely to be
difficult.
 Japan's annual export growth slowed for a third consecutive
month in May in a sign that its overall economic growth could
start to slow as the pace of recovery in overseas demand
moderates.
 
 DOLLAR RECOVERS
 The dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies
after losing 0.4 percent on Wednesday on the back of Fed's
assessment of a faltering pace of recovery.
 The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.2284. The single
currency has fallen 14 percent against the dollar this year.
 ""As the U.S. fiscal stimulus starts to wane, it brings back
the deflationary argument. Together with weak U.S. data, there
are reasons to be pessimistic and that cannot be a positive
environment for risk,"" said Gavin Friend, currency strategist at
National Australia Bank.
 Five-year credit default swaps (CDS), an insurance-like
instruments against debt default, rose to a record high of 959.5
bps, from 934 bps in New York on Wednesday, CDS monitor CMA
DataVision said.
 Five-year CDS on Portugal government debt rose to 335 basis
points from 320.4 bps on Wednesday.
 The Greek/German government bond yield spread has widened
sharply this week because of expected forced selling at the end
of the month by passive indexed funds after Moody's Investors
Service became the second rating agency to downgrade Greece to
junk earlier this month.
 The spreads of Greek 10-year bond over German Bunds rose to
802 basis points (bpS) versus 792 bps at Wednesday's settlement.
 September Bund futures were 29 ticks higher at 128.91, and
10-year German yields fell 3.5 bps to 2.613 percent.

 * Yuan to push world toward multi-currency reserve system
 * Capital controls can help economic management
 HONG KONG, June 24 (Reuters) - China's yuan could rapidly
become an internationally used currency and serve as an
alternative to the U.S. dollar in central bank reserves, the
Asian Development Bank said in a report on Thursday.
 ""The renminbi has yet to become an international currency.
It could become one much more quickly than many anticipate,""
the ADB said in a joint study with Columbia University's the
Earth Institute.
 ""The internationalization of the renminbi has the potential
to become an alternative to the U.S. dollar -- as did the euro
-- and help nudge the global reserve system toward a
multi-currency reserve structure,"" it said.
 The study, undertaken by 11 economists from around the
world, including academics Joseph Stiglitz and Barry
Eichengren, did not provide a timeline for when the yuan could
become a reserve currency.
 Most analysts expect it to be fully convertible by 2020,
the target date set by Beijing to make Shanghai an
international financial centre.
 Global financial markets have focused intensely this week
on the yuan, or renminbi as it is also called, after China's
central bank pledged at the weekend to increase currency
flexibility after pegging the yuan to the U.S. dollar for
nearly two years.
 The yuan has moved in a wider range in the spot market
since then, though it has only appreciated about 0.2 percent
against the dollar.
 The ADB study, entitled ""The Future Global Reserve System
-- An Asian Perspective"", recommended having Asia's vast
currency reserves play a more important role in stabilising the
global financial system, through swap lines, the International
Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and other
borrowing.
 The global financial crisis, which originated in the U.S.
housing market, has sparked a growing discussion among policy
makers and academics that the world should no longer rely on a
single, dominant currency, such as the dollar, as it has done
since the end of the gold standard.
 The ADB study also endorsed the use of capital controls as
a tool to strengthen management of an economy, with the caveat
that they are temporary and coordinated.
 ""These controls on the flow of capital tend to be more
effective when done on a coordinated basis across countries
that are targets of rapid capital movements, rather than
individual countries reacting unilaterally,"" the report said.
 Taiwan implemented capital controls in November 2009, and
Indonesia took steps to manage capital inflows last week. South
Korea is planning to tighten currency derivative trading caps
for foreign banks.
 The study also said a common Asian currency is not a
realistic goal, and regional monetary coordination should stop
short of pegging currencies in the region.
 Since 2000, global foreign exchange reserves have grown by
a staggering $6.15 trillion and stood at $8.09 trillion at the
end of 2009, or 14 percent of the world's gross domestic
product, International Monetary Fund figures showed.
 China and Japan together hold about 43 percent of global
reserves.

 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - The dollar struggled on Thursday
after the Federal Reserve reiterated its pledge to keep rates
low, though its losses against the euro were limited by
persistent doubts about the euro zone economy.
 The dollar's broad weakness helped sterling to extend gains
to a six-week high and underpinned the euro, yet traders
remained reluctant to chase those advances with more signs of
fragile recovery tempering appetite for risky positions.
 ""There was a little disappointment in the market from the
Fed statement but the euro has struggled to rally. The market
remains sceptical about problems in Europe and that feeling
won't go away soon,"" said Antje Praefcke, currency analyst at
Commerzbank.
 At 0720 GMT, the euro was broadly unchanged on the day at
$1.2315 having stalled at $1.2351 in Asia.
 Versus a basket of currencies, the dollar slipped to 85.595
in Asia, bringing it closer to a five-week low hit on Monday of
85.091. It later steadied to trade broadly unchanged at 85.829.
 ""If the market was hoping for re-assurance from the FOMC
they would soon be disappointed as the Federal Reserve signalled

 The dollar was also undermined by data showing sales of new
U.S. single-family homes tumbling more than expected in May.
 
 NEW AUSTRALIAN PM
 The Aussie dollar rose as high as $0.8771 after Australia's
ruling Labor Party elected a new prime minister in Julia
Gillard, in a bid to avoid election defeat later this year.
 Gillard immediately offered to end a bitter dispute over a
controversial ""super profits"" mining tax, saying she would throw
open the door for fresh negotiations. But she stressed miners
should pay more tax.
 The Aussie later trimmed gains to stand at $0.8725, steady
from late U.S. trading on Wednesday.
 ""We expect new PM Gillard to announce a watered down version
of the Resource Super Profits Tax in the coming weeks,"" said RBC
analysts in a note to clients.
 ""The Australian dollar, resources, and equities will be the
likely beneficiaries and should find immediate and longer term
support from today's change of PM,"" they said.
 Sterling rose to $1.5001, the highest since May 12,
extending gains made the previous day after a hint of an early
rise in interest rates in the Bank of England's minutes. The
pound subsequently eased to trade with slight losses at $1.4940.
 Against the yen, the dollar stood at 89.87 yen, stuck near a
one-month low of 89.73 yen hit on Wednesday on trading platform
EBS.
 ""Price action in dollar/yen remains poor and my order board
suggests some more weakness to come, with an initial target of
89.10. Option related offers above 90.30 should see us capped,""
said a London-based spot trader from a U.S. bank.

 By Cheon Jong-woo and Kim Yeon-hee
 SEOUL, June 24 (Reuters) - South Korea's government raised
its growth forecasts on Thursday and announced a gradual return
of economic policy to pre-crisis settings, reinforcing market
expectations that interest rates will start rising soon.
 In another sign of policymakers' growing optimism, the
central bank scaled back a special loan scheme beefed up during
the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
 The government lifted this year's growth forecast to 5.8
percent from 5.0 percent seen early this year and expects the
economy to create 300,000 more jobs this year, 50,000 more than
expected six months ago.
 ""The government plans to gradually normalise macro policy
trend within scope of not hampering the recent economic recovery,
considering employment, inflation and financial market
conditions,"" the finance ministry said in a statement.
 The upgraded outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy
contrasts with the Federal Reserve's admission that the pace of
the U.S. recovery was slipping and persistent worries about the
impact of Europe's debt troubles on global growth.
 South Korea's government acknowledged that Europe's fiscal
turmoil was a risk, but Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun
described as conservative the growth forecast that would mark the
fastest expansion since 2002.
 The upbeat outlook, combined with a promise to phase out
crisis-fighting policies, added to evidence of a growing
consensus between the government and the central bank that
interest rates -- kept at record lows for 16 months -- should
start rising soon.

 Bond futures turned lower as investors firmed their bets on a
rate rise in the next three months, with some bringing forward
the expected timing of such a move.
 ""None of today's remarks and announcements seems to be new
but investors are growing more reluctant to buy as chances for an
interest rate increase continue to grow,"" said Kong Dong-rak, an
fixed-income analyst at Taurus Investment & Securities.
 The September contract on three-year treasury bond futures
was down 0.07 point at 110.03 at 0342 GMT, turning around after
earlier rise to as high as 110.25. The won and stocks little
changed.
 The central bank has already ended most of its
crisis-fighting schemes and on Thursday it cut the ceiling for
the volume of cheap loans for small and medium-sized businesses.
 The government's emergency schemes that boosted spending by
about 5 percent of gross domestic product, are also set to
expire, leaving loose monetary policy as one of the few major
crisis-fighting tools still in place.
 Market consensus is that the Bank of Korea will start raising
its 7-day repurchase agreement, now at 2.0 percent after 325
basis points of cuts -- in the next three months.
 Such expectations were cemented by recent comments
underscoring a shift in policy focus from threats to growth to
inflation pressures associated with sustained recovery.
 The ministry added to such voices saying in its outlook that
there was a need for ""pre-emptive measures against inflationary
 ""Our view was for an interest rate increase in August but
based on what we are hearing lately, I would not exclude a rise
in July,"" said Shin Dong-su, fixed-income analyst at NH
Investment & Securities.
 A senior central bank official later chimed in, telling an
economic seminar that even after a rate rise monetary policy
would remain accommodative.
 The government's updated outlook sees inflation creeping up
to 3.1 percent in the second half from 2.7 percent in the first
quarter and the second quarter, respectively.
 It also paints a picture of broad-based recovery with
continued growth in exports and upgraded forecasts for consumer
spending and investment. Private consumption is seen growing by
4.6 percent, up from the previous 4.2 percent forecast, while
capital investment is seen rising 15.6 percent, up from 11
percent forecast early this year.

 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, June 24 (Reuters) - The dollar stayed on the defensive
on Thursday after the Federal Reserve reiterated its pledge to
keep rates low, while the Australian dollar edged up after the
country's ruling party chose a new Prime Minister, reducing
political uncertainty there.
 The dollar's broad weakness helped the euro to trade firmly
and sterling to extend gains to a six-week high, yet traders
remained reluctant to chase those advances with more signs of
fragile economic recovery tempering appetite for risky positions.
 ""The dollar is clearly under pressure after the FOMC
indicated that interest rates will not rise anytime soon. But
there is no other currency good enough to buy against the dollar
either,"" said Nobuhiko Akai, senior manager of the forex trading
group at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 ""The euro's limited gains against the dollar reflect
deep-seated market concerns about more bad news from the region's
debt or banking sector.""
 The Aussie rose as high as $0.8771 after Australia's ruling
Labor Party elected a new Prime Minister in Julia Gillard, in a
bid to avoid election defeat later this year.
 ""Clearly this is a positive for the Australian dollar and
stocks in the short and medium term,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a senior
economist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""It removes the political uncertainty that had been growing
and would have only got worse. We assume Gillard will negotiate
on the mining tax and produce a watered-down version.""
 Gillard immediately offered to end a bitter dispute over a
controversial ""super profits"" mining tax, saying she would throw
open the door for fresh negotiations. But she stressed miners
should pay more tax.
 The Aussie later trimmed gains to stand at $0.8742, steady
from late U.S. trading on Wednesday.
 The U.S. dollar was on the backfoot after the Fed softened
its view on the U.S. economy in its statement, noting pockets of
weakness in certain sectors and warning against volatile
financial markets given the euro zone debt crisis.

 The interest rate futures market is pricing in the Fed's next
rate increase by the middle of next year.
 The dollar index dipped 0.1 percent to 85.694 after posting
an outside day reversal the previous day, suggesting more losses
might be in store.
 Sterling rose to $1.5001, the highest since May 12,
extending gains made the previous day after a hint of an early
rise in interest rates in the Bank of England's minutes. After
trimming some gains, sterling stood at $1.4979 for a gain of 0.1
percent on the day.
 Its rise on Wednesday pushed sterling up above the cloud on
daily Ichimoku charts, a bullish signal for the currency.
 Sterling is now likely to find support at the top of the
cloud at $1.4876, while facing resistance near $1.5000 and
$1.5050, said Hiroyuki Tanaka, chief technical analyst at Mizuho
Corporate Bank.
 Against the yen, the dollar stood at 89.87 yen, stuck near a
one-month low of 89.73 yen hit on Wednesday on trading platform
EBS.
 The dollar was undermined as U.S. Treasury yields fell with
data showing sales of new U.S. single-family homes tumbling more
than expected in May.
 The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.2331.
 China's central bank set the yuan's daily mid-point at 6.8100
per dollar on Thursday, little changed from Wednesday's close,
and shrugged off renewed calls by U.S. lawmakers for legislation
to press China to allow the yuan to appreciate.
 Major currencies showed muted reaction to the yuan as the
yuan-linked trading fad faded after choppy price actions earlier
this week following China's initial announcement on yuan
flexibility.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2010 01:14AM ET</span>",Trade in focus as Russia's Medvedev visits Obama," * U.S., Russia hope diplomatic 'reset' will boost trade
 * Russia to push for long-delayed WTO entry
 * U.S. to push for intellectual property rights protection
 By Patricia Zengerle and Guy Faulconbridge
 WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev will seek to kick
start trade and investment on Thursday to complement a
political reset between the former Cold War foes.
 Medvedev, who started his U.S. visit with a tour of Silicon
Valley high-technology companies, will hold talks with Obama
and then meet U.S. business leaders to pitch Russia as a
swiftly expanding economy where investors are welcome.
 Medvedev's visit to California's high-tech cradle reflected
his drive to reduce Russia's dependence on natural resource
industries by encouraging innovation and a pro-business
mind-set.
 The Obama administration has tried to engage the Kremlin in
warmer relations since taking office 18 months ago, after
relations between Washington and Moscow had deteriorated,
especially after Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia.
 Obama is keen to bolster meager trade and investment with
Russia as a way to take its reset with Moscow to a new level
after gaining Kremlin support over Afghanistan, Iran sanctions
and a landmark nuclear arms reduction treaty.
 ""Both presidents feel strongly that there's great potential
in the U.S.-Russia relationship that extends beyond some of
these flashpoint issues,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national
security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters.
 ""And that's why the two of them have decided to underscore
the potential, really, of deepening the economic relationship
between the United States and Russia, including a focus on
areas of cooperation related to investment, innovation and,
again, deepening our economic relationship,"" he said.
 Obama's bid to use concessions to Russia in exchange for
better cooperation on the key U.S. foreign policy goals of
Afghanistan, Iran and nuclear disarmament has been welcomed in
the Kremlin.
 There are still divisions between Washington and Moscow,
including disagreement over Georgia, a U.S. ally. The two sides
say they are cooperating over the response to recent ethnic
violence in Kyrgyzstan, but have differences over the U.S.
Manas air base there.
 Thursday's meeting -- which will include lunch and several
meetings with senior officials and business leaders -- will be
the seventh between Obama and Medvedev and officials on both
sides are keen to underscore their close personal ties.
 That atmosphere, the officials say, contrasts with the rows
of the Bush years, when relations sank to a post-Soviet low
during the war between Russia and U.S.-ally Georgia.
 RUSSIA: OPEN FOR BUSINESS?
 Medvedev is eager to attract U.S. investment after the
global economic crisis hammered Russia's economy, revealing --
according to Medvedev -- the weakness of an economic model
dependent on the sale of oil, gas and metals.
 Russia has attracted $265.8 billion in foreign investment
since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, though the United
States accounted for just 3 percent of that, less than Ireland.
U.S. bilateral trade with Russia was just $18.4 billion last
year.
 The 44-year-old Kremlin chief courted business leaders
earlier this month, saying that Russia had changed and that the
Kremlin would welcome foreign investors, though he admits red
tape, corruption and a weak legal system are barriers.
 Senior Kremlin officials said Medvedev would press Obama to
speed up Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
 Russia, the largest economy outside the global trade body,
has accused Washington of holding up its accession, though U.S.
officials say Moscow delayed its own bid by demanding to join
with two former Soviet states, Kazakhstan and Belarus.
 Washington is demanding Russia improve the protection of
intellectual property rights to get support for its WTO entry.
 The leaders of the world's two largest nuclear powers are
likely to discuss ideas on how to further cut their arsenals of
atomic weapons after the April signing of a successor to the
1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The situation in
Kyrgyzstan is also likely to be discussed.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2010 12:50AM ET</span>","Yuan edges up in NDFs, political risks re-emerge"," * Offshore forwards down, imply moderate yuan appreciation
 * Pricing reasonable but risk remains as politics heats up
 * Spot yuan slips, some banks, clients short of dollars
 * China unlikely to concede to U.S. lawmaker pressure on yuan
 By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, June 24 (Reuters) - Dollar/yuan offshore forwards
edged lower on Thursday, implying slightly higher yuan
appreciation that dealers said was now settling at reasonable
levels after the weekend's official depegging from the dollar,
although political risks resurfaced.
 Political concerns intensified overnight when several U.S.
lawmakers renewed calls for legislation to press China on yuan
appreciation, casting uncertainty over how willing the People's
Bank of China will be to allow the yuan to move in the short term
and making even a slight yuan rise implied in NDFs appear
potentially risky.
 Spot yuan drifted lower against the dollar as some banks and
their clients now have too few dollars on hand, after the PBOC's
weekend announcement it would depeg the yuan from the the U.S.
currency spurred them to aggressively sell dollars on Monday, to
bet on yuan appreciation.
 Trading was sluggish on Thursday, after China's state-owned
banks bought dollars heavily on behalf of the PBOC in the spot
market on Tuesday and continued sporadic buying on Wednesday,
dealers said, effectively helping the Chinese central bank to
take back control of the yuan's value by draining dollar supply.
 ""After a flood of dollars into the (spot) market, those who
sold them too cheaply early in the week must buy them back at
higher prices if they need them,"" said a dealer at a major
Chinese commercial bank in Shanghai.
 ""The market has had to learn that the central bank is still
in firm control of the yuan's value. With speculation dying down,
real demand is pushing the dollar slightly higher.""
 The yuan was quoted at 6.8134 to the dollar at midday,
slightly weaker than Wednesday's close of 6.8124 and Thursday's
central bank mid-point of 6.8100, which was little changed from
Wednesday's mid-point of 6.8102.
 The yuan moved in a 57-pip range on Thursday, shrinking from
the daily ranges of 300 pips or more early in the week but still
much wider than the moves of only a few pips per day seen during
most of the two-year dollar peg.
 POLITICAL RISKS
 U.S. senators said on Wednesday they were unmoved by China's
steps to partially free the yuan since the weekend and vowed to
push forward legislation to punish a yuan misalignment they say
distorts trade and steals U.S. jobs.
 China announced over the weekend that it would allow the
yuan's exchange rate to move more freely but it has made it clear
that its currency reform would be gradual and controllable.
 It is widely believed in the domestic market that China will
not concede any more from its present stance and fresh pressures
from U.S. lawmakers are very likely to backfire.
 ""Market and economic conditions have changed so much since
the global financial crisis that it is unrealistic to think China
still has firm plans to allow the yuan to appreciate to a certain
degree in a certain period of time,"" said a senior trader at a
major European bank in Shanghai.
 ""The best China can do is to show that it is friendly, it is
cooperative and it is willing to change in line with market and
economic conditions.""
 The latest euro zone debt crisis has cast doubt on the pace
of China's economic recovery, giving a warning to Beijing once
again how vulnerable the world's third-largest economy is to a
global slowdown.
 Chinese economists often argue that Western critics
underestimate that vulnerability, especially given how far
China's per capita income lags developed countries.
 They say it may be inappropriate to apply Western standards
to the currency of a country whose per capita GDP is only
one-20th that of the United States.
 Caution about Beijing's stance was reflected in the offshore
forwards markets, where speculators were wary about shorting
dollars and suspected that Beijing's currency moves after the
weekend were aimed primarily at appeasing critics before the G20
summit late this week.
 Benchmark one-year dollar/yuan NDFs eased to 6.6670 bid by
midday from Wednesday's close of 6.6700, with implied yuan
appreciation over that period rising to 2.14 percent from 2.10
percent the previous day.
 Three-month NDFs' implied yuan appreciation rose to 0.62
percent from Wednesday's 0.56 percent, as measured from the
central bank's spot mid-point.

mining
 * Environment minister says forests key to climate fight
 * Risk that unchecked mining could fuel Maoist insurgency
 (Repeats to more subscribers)
 By Krittivas Mukherjee an Ruchira Singh
 NEW DELHI, June 24 (Reuters) - India's maverick environment
minister is resisting pressure from some cabinet colleagues to
clear forests for mining and roads in a tussle that underlines
the country's struggle for sustainable growth.
 Jairam Ramesh wants to protect and expand India's remaining
forest land as part of a strategy to fight climate change, but
that could mean giving up mining about a quarter of the
country's mineral reserves, needed to power Asia's
third-largest economy.
 He has scrapped or delayed clearance for some 100 mining
projects, including those backed by India-focused miner Vedanta
Resources Plc  and South Korea's POSCO <005490.KS>,
drawing protests that he is hurting development in a country
acutely short of power and raw materials.
 ""What you see in this debate is the challenge of the
balance between growth and environment protection,"" said Sunita
Narain, head of New Delhi-based Centre for Science and
Environment.
 But saving forests in India is more than just about
protecting the environment.
 Years of uncontrolled mining has pushed tribal people off
their forest land, alienating them and fuelling insurgencies
that feed off a perceived neglect of the poor.
 In India, two-thirds of the population makes a living from
farming and a growing Maoist rebellion has capitalised on
farmers' resentment over the government's seizure of their land
for industry.
 For example, violence has flared over POSCO's proposed
12-million-tonne capacity steel plant in the eastern state of
Orissa. The steelmaker needs 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) of
land and a large portion of the proposed site is forested.
[ID:nSGE64E02M]
 Vedanta wants to push ahead with a long-stalled bauxite
mine in eastern India but a government panel accused Vedanta in
March of violating environmental guidelines. [ID:nSGE62E0TM]
 COLLISION COURSE
 About 65 million hectares, or 20 percent of India's land,
is forested. And this is also where most of India's mineral
resources lie, including huge deposits of iron ore, and the
coal that fuels about 60 percent of India's power output.
 Forests also absorb about 11 percent of India's greenhouse
gas emissions every year.
 Ramesh is among a handful of political leaders watched
closely for their ability to push an agenda to modernise India
against conservative figures in the ruling Congress party
focused more on political expediency.
 He wants to extend forest cover by about a million hectares
every year, putting him on possible collision path with his
colleagues from the mining and highways ministries because it
could put more areas out of bounds for them.
 In his quest to better regulate the mining sector, Ramesh
has identified ""no-go"" zones in forest land that could put
about 620 million tonnes of coal, among other minerals, out of
reach.
 An angry mining ministry has sought the intervention of the
prime minister's office. Officials say it is a tough decision
to make in view of the environmental, social and political
fallout.
 The mining sector's clout means there could be some
redrawing of Ramesh's ""no-go"" zones.
 But a spotlight on steps the world's number four greenhouse
gas polluter takes to cut carbon emissions, and realisation
that taking away forest land from poor tribes will only worsen
the Maoist insurgency, could limit changes.
 Thousands have died in the rebellion since the armed
struggle began in the late 1960s, and the prime minister has
described the insurgency as the nation's biggest security
challenge. [ID:nSGE64U07I]
 Industry says it is pricing in stronger environmental
rules.
 ""I think environmental norms are going to get tougher and
tougher,"" Haresh Melwani, chief executive of mining and
exporting firm HL Nathurmal & Co, told Reuters.
 ""It is being seen not only in India, but globally because
of public awareness. One has to build in environmental costs
into total costs and move on.""
 CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL MINING
 Ramesh has also cracked down on illegal mining, often done
with help from local politicians, and brought more
accountability in a sector that had minimal environmental
regulations.
 Stringent environmental checks are seeing some fallout in
the mining sector.
 ""Gestation periods for mining projects are going up because
of clearance issues,"" said a mining ministry official on
condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to
media.
 Extracting minerals such as coal will be crucial for India
if it has to keep growing at about 10 percent in the medium
term.
 In 2009/10, India's coal output was 531 million tonnes,
about 70 million tonnes short of domestic demand. Coal imports
are forecast to rise beyond 100 million tonnes by 2012.
 Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said on Wednesday that
the threat of Maoist attacks was hampering coal mining in
several states, keeping production lower than the demand from
growing industries [ID:nSGE65M04J].
 Stronger environmental laws could also impact iron ore, of
which India is the world's third largest supplier, shipping out
around 107 million tonnes of the mineral mostly to China in
2009.
 But many in the industry are happy at what they say is
much-needed clarity in policy.
 ""I think the industry has been saying for a long time that
rather than on a reactive basis, tell us proactively what is
permissible and what is not in terms of areas,"" Kameswara Rao,
executive director, PricewaterhouseCoopers, told Reuters.

 * Economy to pick up steam this year
 * RBNZ seen raising rates gradually
(Adds finance minister comment, graphic link)
 By Mantik Kusjanto
 WELLINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand's economy
continued its recovery in the first three months of the year,
albeit at a slower pace, giving its central bank room to keep
raising rates to control inflation.
 It was the fourth quarter of growth as the economy recovers
from the longest recession in more than 30 years. Gross
domestic product rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in the
three months to the end of March, reflecting growth in
manufacturing and exports, official data showed on Thursday.
 Fourth-quarter growth was revised up to 0.9 percent from
0.8 percent -- the fastest pace in two years.
 The data matched the median forecast in a Reuters poll,
while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) had expected 0.8
percent growth.
 ""We expect the RBNZ to lift the cash rate by 25 basis
points at each opportunity, taking it to 3.75 percent by
year-end, but recognise the risk of a pause should global or
domestic developments shift for the worse,"" said UBS senior
economist Robin Clements.
 The New Zealand dollar was unmoved by the data holding
steady around $0.7020/30 level. Interest rate futures and swap
yields were also unchanged.
 OUTLOOK BRIGHT
 Growth in the quarter was driven by recovery in
manufacturing and wholesale trade, which expanded for a second
quarter following seven quarters of decline. Rising exports,
led by dairy, logs and metal products, also supported the
recovery.
 Domestic consumption, which makes up around 60 percent of
the economy, increased 0.2 percent, compared with a 0.8 percent
rise in the December quarter. Inventories were built up for a
second quarter, after three quarters of run downs.
 Analysts said growth would pick up, helped by solid demand
from Australia and China, its main trading partners.
 ""Forward indicators point to accelerating momentum in the
economy, particularly for nominal GDP thanks to record high
commodity prices,"" said ANZ-National senior economist Khoon
Goh.
 The housing market has stalled so far this year and
consumers been cautious about spending, but prices for major
export items such as dairy and logs have hit their highest
level in a decade, resulting in the first annual trade surplus
in eight years.
 Analysts expect the economy to grow 0.8 percent in the
second quarter and largely maintained its pace through year
end, according to a recent Reuters poll.
 The RBNZ has forecast annual growth to average 3.5 percent
over the next two years from a 0.4 percent contraction in
March.
 The outlook is likely to underpin the RBNZ's policy of the
gradual removal of stimulus from the economy, as consumer price
inflation gathers pace. The bank raised rates on June 10,
taking the cash rate to 2.75 percent from a record low 2.5
percent, where it had been held for a year.
 Financial markets are pricing in an 80 percent chance of a
further rate rise on July 29.
 The latest Reuters poll has all 18 economists expecting a
rise next month, with the cash rate seen at 3.75 percent by
year's end.
 Finance Minister Bill English said the economy needed
further rebalancing to exports and productive industries and
away from the rampant borrowing for housing and consumption.
 ""While the global outlook has strengthened in the past
year, it remains fragile, as we can see from the sovereign debt
crisis in Europe,"" he said in a statement after the GDP data.
 Last month, the government budget unveiled personal and
company tax cuts, offset by a rise in the value-added sales
tax, while it also moved to tighten tax rules on property
investment, denting the allure of such unproductive assets.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2010 11:42PM ET</span>",Ex-PBOC adviser sees no change to China FX reserves," BEIJING, June 24 (Reuters) - China will not alter the
composition of its official currency holdings in the wake of its
decision to let the yuan resume moving more freely, Li Yang, a
former central bank adviser, said on Thursday.
 In permitting greater yuan flexibility, China had simply
reactivated the same exchange rate regime that it put on hold in
July 2008 as a response to the global financial crisis, Li told
Reuters on the sidelines of a financial forum.
 ""Now the crisis is over, we are continuing with yuan reform
again,"" said Li, now a senior official at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, a leading government think tank.
 Some academics have speculated that a stronger yuan
, by increasing China's purchasing power, would boost
commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar  and
that Beijing should tweak the composition of its currency
holdings accordingly.
 Asked about that line of thinking, Li said: ""No, there will
be no adjustments.""
 China does not disclose the make-up of its currency holdings,
which totalled $2.45 trillion at the end of March, the largest
stockpile in the world. Bankers assume two-thirds of the reserves
are invested in dollar assets.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, June 24 (Reuters) - Japan's annual export growth
slowed for a third consecutive month in May in a sign that its
overall economic growth could start to slow as the pace of
recovery in overseas demand moderates.
 Exports also fell 1.2 percent from the previous month on a
seasonally adjusted basis as signs of weakness in the U.S.
economic recovery and steps to curb bank lending and investment
in China hampered demand for Japanese goods.
 External demand is likely to continue to make a positive
contribution to Japan's gross domestic product due to demand
from Asia. But analysts say this positive contribution could
shrink as global restocking of inventories runs its course.
 They are also cautious about the outlook as Europe's debt
problems and recent yen strength could slow Japanese shipments
in the coming months.
 ""Exports grew at a slower-than-expected pace apparently due
to the effects of China's tightening"" of banks' reserve
requirements, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at
Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo.
 ""Europe's debt crisis is also expected to impact China's
exports to Europe in the coming months as the euro's drop hurts
Chinese firms' competitiveness. This in turn is likely to
prevent Japan's exports from recovering fully.""
 Exports rose 32.1 percent in the year to May on gains in
shipments of cars, steel and semiconductors, less than the
median forecast for a 36.9 percent rise, the Ministry of Finance
said.
 Export growth has been slowing after shipments rose an
annual 45.3 percent in February, the largest gain since 1980.
 Exports to fast-growing Asia including China, which accounts
for more than half of Japan's total shipments, rose 34.4 percent
from a year earlier, slowing for the fourth consecutive month
after they jumped a record 68.3 percent in January
 Economists polled by Reuters expect Japan's economic growth
to slow to 0.4 percent in April-June from the 1.2 percent seen
in the first quarter, partly as the effects of government
stimulus fades and export growth moderates.
 They expect the world's No.2 economy to grow 2.5 percent in
the fiscal year to next March, largely in line with government
projections and more than the Bank of Japan forecast.
 The government has vowed to achieve an average 2 percent
real growth over the next 10 years by carrying out its growth
strategies. But analysts say this will be a tall order given
that the economy grew a meagre 1.3 percent on average in the
decade until the financial crisis in 2008 that led to a global
recession.
 NO EFFECTS FROM EUROPE
 A finance ministry official said the trade data showed no
effects from Europe's debt problems. But the ministry will keep
an eye on its impact on Japan's exports in the future, he said.
 Shipments to the European Union rose an annual 17.4 percent
due to demand for auto parts and electronics parts from Germany.
Annual growth has slowed for the second straight month after a
26.7 percent rise in March, the biggest gain since 1998.
 Yoshimasa Maruyama, an economist at Itochu Corp, said
Japan's real exports to the EU grew 2.4 percent from the
previous month, with capital goods such as chemicals and metal
products marking double-digit gains.
 ""I guess the euro's weakness helped boost exports and output
in countries like Germany, which has in turn increased demand
for Japanese parts and materials,"" Maruyama said.
 ""There was no major change in the trend that expansion in
emerging Asia leads the world economy. Therefore Japan's exports
will continue to grow, but the pace of growth will be slower
compared with the past year as global restocking of inventory
runs its course.""
 Slowing export growth was also evident in shipments to the
United States, a key destination for Japanese goods. U.S.-bound
exports rose an annual 17.7 percent, but pace slowed from a 50.5
percent rise in February, the biggest gain since 1984.
 The Federal Reserve acknowledged the faltering pace of U.S.
economic recovery on Wednesday as it renewed its vow to hold
benchmark interest rates exceptionally low for an extended
period.
 In a statement at the end of a two-day meeting, the Fed
scaled back its assessment of the pace of recovery, recognising
pockets of weakness, and also issued a cautionary note about
volatile financial markets in light of Europe's debt woes.
 Japan's finance ministry is also watching any effects from
China's yuan policy on the country's trade, the official said,
adding that it could have both merits and demerits.
 China's trading partners are anxious for Beijing to spell
out how quickly it will let the yuan rise after it said on
Saturday that it was ending the currency's 23-month-old peg to
the dollar.
 Japan's overall imports rose 33.4 percent in May from a year
earlier, marking the biggest gain since 2006 and bringing the
country's trade surplus to 324.2 billion yen ($3.61 billion).

 SYDNEY, June 24 (Reuters) - The dollar stayed on the
defensive on Thursday after the Federal Reserve reiterated its
pledge to keep rates low, while the Australian dollar gained
after the country's ruling party chose a new prime minister.
 The Aussie  rose to as high as $0.8771, from $0.8751,
after it emerged that the ruling Labor Party had elected a new
Prime Minister in Julia Gillard. That stirred hopes the
government would compromise on a controversial mining tax that
had unsettled offshore investors.
 ""Clearly this is a positive for the Australian dollar and
stocks in the short and medium term,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a senior
economist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""It removes the political uncertainty that had been growing
and would have only got worse. We assume Gillard will negotiate
on the mining tax and produce a watered-down version.""

 In Asian trade, the dollar index <.DXY> was fla at 85.765

session, suggesting more losses might be in store.
 Against the yen , the dollar was near a one-month low
around 89.83 yen in Asian trade, though dealers said there were
buy orders underneath from Japanese importers.
 The dollar was undermined as U.S. Treasury yields fell with
data showing sales of new U.S. single-family homes tumbling more
than expected in May.
 The euro  held steady at $1.2315, just below
Wednesday's high of $1.2344. Traders said the euro held gains
despite a deterioration in Greek-German yield spreads which
widened 60-70 basis points across the curve.
 But the euro is also likely to be restrained by news that
borrowing by Portuguese banks from the European Central Bank
doubled in May to a record 35.8 billion euros ($48.03 billion),
highlighting their reliance on ECB funds.

 By Patricia Zengerle
 WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
will hold bilateral meetings with six other leaders, including
five from Asian countries and Britain's new prime minister, at
the G20 summit in Canada this weekend, a senior administration
official said.
 He will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, South Korean
President Lee Myung-bak, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Indonesia President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the official said.
 The preponderance of meetings with Asia-Pacific leaders is
deliberate, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in
advance of the Group of 20 meeting.
 ""It represents the priority that the president places on
the region,"" the official said.
 Obama will also have his first face-to-face meeting with
Britain's new prime minister, David Cameron, since Cameron
took office in May. The two will discuss BP Plc ,
following British concern that Obama has been too harsh on the
oil company over the spill fouling the Gulf of Mexico.
 The meeting with Kan will be Obama's first since the new
Japanese leader became prime minister this month. The two are
expected to discuss issues including anger in Japan over U.S.
military bases on the island of Okinawa.
 Kan became prime minister after Yukio Hatoyama quit in
response to public outrage for his breaking a promise to move a
U.S. air base off Okinawa, which hosts about half the 49,000
U.S. military personnel in Japan.
 Obama and Hu will discuss a range of issues including
China's yuan currency, the official said.
 Under pressure from the United States and other trading
partners, China just announced it was ending the yuan's
two-year peg to the dollar to allow greater flexibility in its
closely managed exchange rate.

 NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened across
the board while Treasuries rallied on Wednesday after the U.S.
Federal Reserve acknowledged a faltering economic recovery and
data showed sales of new U.S. homes fell to a lifetime low.
 U.S. stocks, which traded mostly down since the market's
open, zigzagged and closed mostly lower after the Fed issued
its monetary policy statement, which suggested interest rates
will remain near zero longer than expected.
 The Dow industrials, however, eked out a tiny gain just as
the regular sesssion ended.
 In the statement, U.S. policy-makers repeated that the
economy will continue to gradually emerge from recession, but
took note of pockets of economic weakness. [ID:nN22150078]
 Without directly mentioning Europe's debt problems, they
said financial conditions have become less supportive of
growth, ""largely reflecting developments abroad.""
 ""There's no rate hike expected for the foreseeable future
- at least not until the end of the year, if not 2011,"" said
Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in
New York. ""The longer the Fed keeps kicking the can down the
road, the less positive this is for the U.S. dollar outlook.""
 The dollar slid 0.37 percent against a basket of major
trading-partner currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index
<.DXY>.
 The euro , which had weakened earlier on renewed
fears about the European banking system, gained 0.36 percent
to $1.2313.
 Against the Japanese yen, the U.S. currency  slid
0.80 percent to 89.84.
 Concerns about the pace of the economic recovery were on
the rise since the beginning of the session, when government
data showed sales of U.S. single-family homes dropped 32.7
percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000
units, the lowest level since record keeping started in 1963.
 The drop unwound two months of gains, which had been
inspired by a government tax credit for home buyers, and
increased investors' aversion to risk in general.
 WHEN DOVES FLY, THE DOW RISES
 While the Fed's softened economic view weighed on
sentiment, prospects of a prolonged period of near-zero
interest rates in the United States offered some support to
stocks, tipping the Dow into positive territory in late
afternoon.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> edged up 4.92
points, or 0.05 percent, to end at 10,298.44, while the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> dropped 3.27 points, or
0.30 percent, to 1,092.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
fell 7.57 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,254.23
 ""Just when one thought the FOMC couldn't get more dovish,
they get more dovish, specifically on inflation,"" said Peter
Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & CO in New York.
""Rates will stay 'exceptionally low' for a very, very, very,
very long time.""
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> of top
shares closed down 1.02 percent before the Fed statement, with
technical charts suggesting there could be more declines over
the coming days.
 ""We have fallen back after U.S. new home sales data and,
in this context, we expect the market to continue to go lower
over the next week,"" said Christian Stocker, strategist at
UniCredit Global Research in Munich.
 Financial stocks ranked among the top decliners in Europe,
with Barclays , BNP Paribas , Credit Agricole
 and Societe Generale  down 1.4 percent to
3.2 percent.
 Concerns about Europe's banking system were on the rise
after Credit Agricole pushed back profit targets for its
struggling Greek unit Emporiki  and said it would
take a 400-million-euro ($536.7 million) write-down as Greece
fights to manage its debt load. [ID:nLDE65L0NB]

0.83 percent, while the firm's index of emerging market stocks

 BONDS JUMP, OIL AND GOLD SLIP
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  jumped
11/32, with the yield falling to 3.12 percent from Tuesday's
close of 3.17 as the Fed said in its statement that ""inflation
is likely to be subdued for some time.""
 The yield curve also flattened as investors bought
longer-dated Treasuries on the rationale that they would be a
safe place to park savings in a deteriorating economic
environment.
 The more dovish Fed tone could also lead some investors to
wonder whether the U.S. central bank might restart its
quantitative easing program of Treasuries purchases if the
data begins a sharper downturn from here.
 U.S. crude oil futures prices  fell $1.50, or 1.93
percent, to settle at $76.35 a barrel, also pressured by a
sharp increase in domestic crude stocks last week and a
forecast from the International Energy Agency that supplies
would be comfortable for the next five years.
 Gold prices shrugged off the Fed's view. In late afternoon
trading, spot gold  traded at $1,234.55 an ounce, close
to where it was on Tuesday in late New York trading, when it
was quoted at $1.239.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 23 (Reuters) - A pair of soft economic
reports triggered a sharp fall in the Canadian dollar against
its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, though it pruned losses by
session's end after the U.S. Federal Reserve reiterated its
pledge to keep interest rates low for an extended period.
 The Fed's statement, which struck a cautious tone on the
U.S. economy, met market expectations. [ID:nTRU002480]
 But it came after data that showed U.S. new home sales fell
a record 32.7 percent in May to the lowest level in at least
four decades. [ID:nN23209668]
 The housing data pointed to more economic uncertainty and
spurred safe-haven buying of the U.S. dollar, pushing the
Canadian dollar to its lowest point since June 9 at C$1.0461 to
the U.S. dollar, or 95.59 U.S. cents.
 It subsequently pared losses but still finished lower for a
third straight session at C$1.0384 to the U.S. dollar, or 96.30
U.S. cents. That was down from C$1.0291 to the U.S. dollar, or
97.17 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close.
 ""Essentially, the worry in the market is that the U.S.
economy is weaker than people had thought, and that would in
turn would play into the Canadian economy,"" said Camilla
Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital.
 She noted as well that it was a big day for technical
trading as the 50-day moving average crossed the 100-day.
 ""That's an event that doesn't happen that often, and when
it happens, it tends to be a pretty good indicator of pricing
pressure in the market,"" she said. ""Now we've seen the reverse
... It implies there is upward pressure in dollar/Canada.""
 WEAK RETAIL SALES SPARKS C$ DECLINE
 The currency's weakness began shortly after figures showed
Canadian retail sales fell a sharper than expected 2 percent in
April from March. That was well below the median forecast of a
0.4 percent decline by analysts surveyed by Reuters.
[ID:nN23196800]
 ""This was quite a disappointing report. The broad-based
nature of it suggests that, during the month, Canadians more or
less sat on their hands,"" said Millan Mulraine, economics
strategist at TD Securities.
 He added, however, that the report was unlikely to prevent
the Bank of Canada from raising rates next month.
 The Canadian currency was also tugged lower by weak oil
prices, which fell towards $76 a barrel, while equity markets
were mixed.
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said in a Reuters
interview on Wednesday that the central bank was watching the
Canadian dollar as a factor in monetary policy, echoing
comments made by Deputy Governor Timothy Lane on Tuesday.
[ID:nN22144820]
 ""It's one of the factors we have to take into consideration
every time we make a decision ... we're watching that closely,""

 ""Absolute strength matters. Volatility matters a lot

 BOND PRICES SOAR
 Canadian government bond prices were all in positive
territory after the morning's run of soft data and held gains
following the Fed's rate announcement.
 The two-year government bond  was up 16 Canadian
cents to yield 1.610 percent, while the 10-year bond
 gained 17 Canadian cents to yield 3.239 percent.
 Canadian bonds were mixed against U.S. Treasuries, with
short-term bonds outperforming and long-dated issues
underperforming. The Canadian 10-year bond yield was 11.6 basis
points above its U.S. counterpart, compared with 9.4 basis
points on Tuesday.

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened against
the euro and yen on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve reiterated
its pledge to keep interest rates low for an extended period
and struck a cautious tone on the U.S. economy.
 Low U.S. rates, currently near zero, should diminish the
appeal of dollar-denominated assets, especially as the global
economy starts to recover.
 The Fed also softened its view on the U.S. economy in its
statement, noting pockets of weakness in certain sectors and
and warning against volatile financial markets given the euro
zone debt crisis.
 ""It's dovish. There's no rate hike expected for the
foreseeable future,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 ""The Fed is concerned about threats to growth, not threats
to inflation. The longer the Fed keeps kicking the can down the
road, the less positive this is for the U.S. dollar outlook,""
he added.
 The interest rate futures market is pricing in the Fed's
next rate increase by the middle of next year.
 The euro rose to session highs against the dollar to
$1.2344, according to electronic trading platform EBS. It was
last up 0.4 percent at $1.2313.
 It was a huge turnaround for the euro, which traded lower
earlier in the session, as concerns persisted about the
viability of the euro zone banking system.
 The euro earlier hit an all-time low against the Swiss
franc to 1.3545 francs on trading platform EBS. Traders said
option barriers were in place at 1.3500 with large stops
lurking below.
 News that borrowing by Portuguese banks from the European
Central Bank doubled in May to a record 35.8 billion euros
($48.03 billion) highlighted bank reliance on ECB funds and
weighed on the single euro zone currency.
 Against the yen, the dollar hit the day's lows at 89.73 and
last traded down 0.7 percent at 89.88 yen.
 Data showing sales of new U.S. single-family homes tumbled
more than expected to a record low in May did not help the
dollar's cause as well.
 Overall, the Fed's remarks, reflecting the promise of
cheap, easy money boosted risk appetite and pushed pro-risk
currencies higher such as the New Zealand dollar. The Kiwi
dollar surged 1.2 percent against the greenback to US$0.7129.
 ""The (Fed) statement could be read as a double-edged sword
for the risk trade. The acknowledgment of softer growth risks
is negative, but the Fed on hold for longer is good for risk,""
said Alan Ruskin, chief currency strategist, at RBS Global
Banking and Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The Fed statement also helped the Australian currency,
another pro-risk currency, erase its losses. The Aussie dollar
last changed hands at US$0.8727, up slightly from late
Tuesday.
 The Aussie dollar had been struggling for most of the
session after Australian Prime Minister Rudd agreed to a
request from his deputy Julia Gillard to challenge for the
leadership and called a vote of ruling party lawmakers for
early Thursday, Australian time (2300 GMT Wednesday).
 Gillard, if successful, would become Australia's first
woman prime minister.
 Sterling, meanwhile, extended gains after minutes from the
Bank of England's June meeting showed an unexpected split, with
Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance voting for a
25 basis point rate increase.
 The pound rose to a six-week high against the dollar at
$1.4975 and last traded at $1.4953, up nearly 1.0 percent on
the day.

 * Strong exports to support Q3, Q4 growth
 * Debt crisis heightens downside risks
 
 By Vicky Buffery
 PARIS, June 23 (Reuters) - The French economy is on track to
meet the government's growth target of 1.4 percent in 2010,
statistics agency INSEE said on Wednesday, as activity rebounds
in the second quarter and a weak euro helps buoy exports. 
 But downside risks have increased in the wake of the euro
zone debt crisis, INSEE said, with fiscal tightening and
financial market tensions threatening to derail this
return-to-growth scenario.
 ""We've been seeing a trend of recovery in global activity
for a number of quarters, but there's still some way to go and
the road may at times prove rocky,"" said Sandrine Duchene, head
of the INSEE forecasting unit.
 In its latest economic report, INSEE said it now expects
gross domestic product (GDP) in the euro zone's second largest
economy to expand by 0.5 percent in the second quarter of the
year, up from its previous forecast for 0.3 percent growth.
 The rebound after the first quarter's disappointing 0.1
percent growth is being driven by a pick-up in business
investment, INSEE said, but above all by the first rise in
private sector employment since before the financial crisis.
 Indeed, recent data showed French non-farm payrolls rose 0.2
percent in the first quarter of the year, after stabilising in
the final months of 2009.
 GDP will then expand by 0.4 percent in the third and fourth
quarters, INSEE said, as recent falls in the euro help sustain
foreign demand for French products, creating a positive knock-on
effect on business investment and eventually domestic demand.
 For the full-year, INSEE expects GDP to grow by 1.4 percent,
in line with the government's official forecast.
 ""In 2010, the depreciation of the euro will boost exports by
around 1.6 percent, and add 0.5 percent to growth,"" said INSEE
official Benoit Heitz.
 
 AUSTERITY DRIVE
 The euro zone currency has slumped over 14 percent against
the dollar since the start of the year, battered by the Greek
debt crisis which has undermined confidence in the health of
public finances in the 16-nation bloc.
 The trend has proved positive for exporters such as
aerospace group EADS  who had repeatedly complained the
previously high level of the euro was hurting competitiveness.
 But at the same time, the debt crisis is forcing European
governments to take firm action to cut spending and boost tax
receipts, in a bid to bring fragile public finances under
control.
 France is forecasting its public deficit will hit 8.0
percent of GDP this year, and is aiming to bring this figure
down to the European Union's target of 3 percent by 2013.
 The growing risk economists see now is that austerity
measures in France and neighbouring countries will undermine
consumer confidence and drive up savings rates, weighing on
consumer demand and derailing the economic recovery.
 Any increase in the financial market tension witnessed in
recent months could also cause business financing to dry up and
limit future levels of investment.
 French workers will take to the streets tomorrow in protest
at government plans to raise the minimum retirement age in a bid
to salvage the country's indebted pensions system.
 The government has also announced a freeze in public
spending over the next three years and 10 percent cut in state
operating costs, and is planning to announce new fiscal
tightening moves before the autumn.

 NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell against
the euro and yen on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept
interest rates steady at near zero, as expected, and reiterated
its pledge to keep rates low for an extended period.
 Low interest rates should diminish the appeal of
dollar-denominated assets, especially as the global economy
starts to recover.
 In its statement, the Fed also softened its view on the
U.S. economy, noting pockets of weakness in certain sectors and
and cautioning against volatile financial markets given the
euro zone' debt crisis.
 ""It's dovish. There's no rate hike expected for the
foreseeable future,"" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 ""The Fed is concerned about threats to growth, not threats
to inflation. The longer the Fed keeps kicking the can down the
road, the less positive this is for the U.S. dollar outlook.""
 The euro  rose to session highs against the
dollar to $1.2344, according to electronic trading platform
EBS. It was last at $1.2332, up 0.5 percent.
 Against the yen , the dollar hit the day's lows at

(Updates with comments by officials, lawmakers at hearing)
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - Top U.S. officials told
Congress on Wednesday they had serious concerns about Chinese
trade policies that keep out American companies and would take
strong action if necessary to pry open the market.
 In testimony to the Senate Finance Committee, U.S. Trade
Representative Ron Kirk and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke also
said President Barack Obama's team would keep a close eye on
recent steps by China to reform its currency policy.
 ""My colleague, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, will be
closely monitoring how far and how fast the Chinese let their
currency appreciate and will continue to raise this issue with
Chinese officials,"" Locke said.
 Locke also said the Commerce Department was carefully
considering requests to apply ""countervailing duties"" against
China's currency in two cases now before the department
involving paper and aluminum products.
 ""Given the scrutiny that such decisions face in U.S. courts
and at the WTO, I want to make sure our decision on whether to
investigate is warranted by the facts and the law,"" Locke said,
referring to the World Trade Organization.
 Under pressure from the United States and other trading
partners, China announced over weekend that it was ditching a
two-year peg to the dollar to allow more flexibility in its
closely managed exchange rate.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus told the
hearing that Beijing's move had opened the door to appreciating
its currency, but ""Commerce must carefully consider whether
China's currency practices constitute an improper subsidy under
U.S. law.""
 The Obama administration welcomed the action, but many
members of Congress viewed it with suspicion and complained
that China's exchange rate remains undervalued by 25 percent to
40 percent.
 Under questioning from Senators about China's new currency
policy, Kirk said: ""We don't see that as the end of that
discussion at all"" and added that he expected G20 leaders would
discuss the yuan in Toronto later this week.
 Reflecting that concern, a group of lawmakers on
Wednesday demanded a vote on a bill that would require the
Commerce Department to treat undervalued currencies as an
unfair export subsidy so companies could seek countervailing
duties.
 'EMPTY PROMISES'
 ""America cannot keep relying on more empty promises from
China,"" said Representative Tim Murphy, a Republican, at a
rally with labor and manufacturing groups to push for the
bill.
 Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat, said he believed
""grass roots"" pressure would mount until there is a vote on the
bill, which already has more than 120 sponsors in the
435-member House of Representatives.
 Neither Locke nor Kirk dwelt on the currency issue, since
traditionally only the president and Treasury secretary speak
about currency matters.
 But both cabinet officials felt free to speak about Chinese
policies they said unfairly favor Chinese companies at the
expense U.S. and other foreign firms.
 ""Top priority concerns include addressing indigenous
innovation and other discriminatory industrial policies,"" Kirk
told the panel, referring to a Chinese policy that favors
domestic firms in government procurement.
 The United States hopes for progress on those concerns by a
meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and
Trade near the end of this year.
 But Washington is prepared to go to the World Trade
Organization or take other enforcement actions ""when dialogue
fails,"" Kirk said.
 Locke, who led a group of U.S. clean energy companies on a
trade mission to China last month, said he shared the concern
of many American companies that China was backsliding on its
commitment to market openness.
 ""Far more needs to be done before we can be sure that
commercial trends affecting U.S. business in China are once
again headed in the right direction,"" Locke said.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - Global stocks and the
euro fell on Wednesday after record low sales of new U.S.
homes added to worries about the global recovery and investors
were cautious before the Federal Reserve's policy statement.
 The disappointing U.S. housing data caused U.S. Treasuries
prices to rally, while sending the cost of protecting Greek
government bonds from default to a near record high.
 Oil prices also slid more than $2 per barrel following
reports that showed inventories on the rise.
 Sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped a record
32.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 300,000
units, the lowest level since record keeping started in 1963.
The drop unwound two months of gains, which had been inspired

 * Says new US offer could have ""catalytic"" effect
 By Doug Palmer
 WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - The United States should
try to save world trade talks from a fatal plunge into oblivion
by offering deeper cuts in politically-sensitive farm subsidies
and tariffs, a top U.S. trade analyst said on Wednesday.
 Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute
for International Economics, was speaking during a discussion
on what to expect on the trade front during the Group of 20
leaders meeting this weekend in Toronto.
 He said he feared without U.S. leadership the nearly
nine-year-old negotiations known as the Doha round was headed
toward a ""Niagara moment,"" referring to the waterfall on the
U.S.-Canadian border.
 ""If the talks continue to drift downstream, I think there's
a very really chance that the Doha round will fall crashing
down over the falls,"" Schott said. 
 ""You have to steer (the negotiations) away from the rocks,
and nobody is doing any steering,"" Schott said.
 World Trade Organization members launched the Doha round in
late 2001 with the goal of helping poor countries prosper
through trade.
 The talks have been stymied by disagreements over how much
rich countries like the United States and the European Union
should cut their trade-distorting farm subsidies and tariffs in
exchange for new market openings by Brazil, India, China and
other leading developing countries.
 Last year, G20 leaders meeting in Pittsburgh called on
their negotiators to reach an agreement by the end of 2010.
 In reality, ""nothing has happened"" in the negotiations for
nearly two years, Schott said.
 Instead, the former U.S. Treasury Department official and
trade negotiator said there was a growing complacency around
the world with the idea of not completing the round.
 To break the talks out of their doldrums, President Barack
Obama's administration should take ""catalytic action"" by
offering deeper cuts in U.S. farm subsidies and tariffs than
now on the table, Schott said.
 That hopefully would encourage other countries to make
improved offers to open their own markets, especially in
services, a sector which has lagged behind manufacturing and
agriculture in the negotiations, he said.
 Many U.S. farm-state politicians believe the United States
already has been too generous in the negotiations and could
attack Obama for making a new offer at this point.
 Schott insisted the move carried no risk, since if other
countries did not immediately reciprocate there was no
possibility of reaching a deal the U.S. Congress would
approve.

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 23 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar tumbled to
a two-week low against the U.S. currency on Wednesday after a
pair of soft economic reports raised concerns about the pace of
the global economic recovery.
 Weak auto sales helped depress Canadian April retail sales,
which fell a sharper than expected 2 percent from March. That
put the month well behind the median forecast for a 0.4 percent
decline in retail sales, according to government data.
[ID:nN23196800]
 ""This was quite a disappointing report. The broad-based
nature of it suggests that, during the month, Canadians more or
less sat on their hands,"" said Millan Mulraine, economics
strategist at TD Securities.
 He added the report was unlikely to prevent the Bank of
Canada from raising rates next month.
 At 10:55 a.m. (1455 GMT), the currency was at C$1.0435 to
the U.S. dollar, or 95.83 U.S. cents, down from C$1.0291 to the
U.S. dollar, or 97.17 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close.
 The currency's decline was further pressured by data that
showed sales of new U.S. homes fell a record 32.7 percent in
May to the lowest level in at least four decades as the boost
from a popular tax credit faded. [ID:nN23209668]
 The Canadian dollar hit its lowest point since June 9 at
C$1.0461 to the U.S. dollar, or 95.59 U.S. cents, following the
U.S. housing data, before paring losses.
 Jon Gencher, director of foreign exchange sales at BMO
Capital Markets, noted that recent economic data had put equity
markets on guard.
 ""If you look at the U.S. data as of late it looks to be
mixed, if not weaker than the market would like. That seems to
be the driving factor, that maybe economic growth is stalling,""
said
 ""That certainly has the market trading on a very cautious
note,"" said Gencher.
 Additionally, the currency was tugged lower by weak oil
prices, which fell towards $76 a barrel, while equity markets
were mixed.
 Earlier, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said the
central bank was watching the Canadian dollar as a factor in
monetary policy, echoing comments made by deputy governor
Timothy Lane on Tuesday. [ID:nN22144820]
 ""It's one of the factors we have to take into consideration
every time we make a decision ... we're watching that closely,""
he told Reuters Insider. [ID:nN23179479]
 ""Absolute strength matters. Volatility matters a lot
though as well.""
 Lane said on Tuesday that the value of the Canadian
currency against the U.S. dollar would affect the central
bank's decision on interest rates on July 20 and beyond.
 BOND PRICES SOAR
 Canadian government bond prices were all in positive
territory after the morning's run of soft data.
 Market players were also awaiting an announcement by the
U.S. Federal Reserve later in the day. The U.S. central bank is
expected to restate its intention to keep interest rates on
hold near zero for ""an extended period"" and perhaps offer a
less upbeat outlook for the economy. [ID:nN22150078]
 The two-year government bond  was up 14 Canadian
cents to yield 1.621 percent, while the 10-year bond
 gained 17 Canadian cents to yield 3.239 percent.

 NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against

zone banking system and the potential for economic stress in

 News that borrowing by Portuguese banks from the European
Central Bank doubled in May to a record 35.8 billion euros

percent at $0.8691 . Currencies of all the
commodity-based economies lost ground after the data.
 Earlier the U.S. dollar rose to a session peak after
Australian Prime Minister Rudd agreed to a request from his
deputy Julia Gillard for her to challenge for the leadership
and called a vote of ruling party lawmakers for Thursday
morning Australian time (Wednesday 2300 GMT). Gillard, if
successful, would become Australia's first woman prime
minister.
 Reports that Rudd's leadership was in doubt have been
circulating for days.
 Though news that China will allow the yuan to appreciate
has faded from investor focus, the South Korean won has sharply

 * Capesize market set to remain under pressure
 
 (Adds comment, detail, background)
 By Jackie Cowhig and Jonathan Saul
 LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - Coal at current prices is more
attractive to buy than sell because the medium to long-term
prospects are bullish, driven by Indian and Chinese import
demand, analysts with broker ICAP Shipping said on Wednesday.
 Benchmark Australian coal prices have fallen to around $93 a
tonnne free on board (FOB) Newcastle from around $100 in May as
Chinese imports have slowed.
 ""There is short-term downside risk (for coal prices) on the
back of the economic slowdown, but from Q4 onwards we remain
positive,"" Georgi Slavov, head of dry freight research at ICAP
Shipping, told Reuters in an interview.
 ""Newcastle FOB prices of over $105 a tonne are very
achievable.""
 The growth in Chinese coal imports since late 2009 has
helped drive coal prices higher globally.
 ""We're not positive on any commodity market now, not even
freight, but at current prices coal would be a buy not a sell,""
Slavov said.
 He said projections such as that by the International Energy
Agency (IEA) for 2010 import growth of 70-100 million tonnes were
""over-optimistic"" because international coal was no longer
cheaper than domestic stocks, he said.
 ""In the last couple of weeks the price difference between
Chinese domestic coal and Newcastle has come down to zero and
imports reacted almost immediately,"" Slavov said.
 Any appreciation of the Chinese yuan, stemming from
Beijing's promise of currency flexibility, could boost very
near-term imports of commodities, if end-users decide to use
their greater buying power to stockpile.
 But the U.S. dollar is a far more important factor for
commodity prices in general, Slavov said.
 India, which imports coal to fill a physical shortage rather
than to take advantage of arbitrage as China does, will be the
most important price-driver for coal prices in the next 5-10
years, he said.
 India's imports hit a record 80 million tonnes in 2009 and
are set to rise above 100 million this year and will use more
ships of panamax or capesize as new, bigger ports come into
operation, he added.
 
 FREIGHT MARKET
 Weaker Chinese demand for iron ore and coal in recent weeks
has hit freight rates with the Baltic Exchange's main sea
freight index sinking to its lowest in over eight months.
 ICAP said it remained bearish on the outlook for larger
capesize vessels which typically haul 150,000-tonne cargoes such
as iron ore and coal. It said that while fleet growth would put
pressure on capesize rates, fresh iron ore buying by China could
create scope for some gains.
 ""We would not rule out a modest spike in the capesize market
later in the year,"" James Leake, managing director of research
at ICAP Shipping, said.
 ICAP estimated net fleet growth of 18.7 percent for
capesizes this year compared with 3 percent for smaller
panamaxes and 3.5 percent for handysizes.
 ""Double digit fleet growth is expected for the capes this
year even taking into account massive slippage (delays) and
cancellations,"" Slavov said.
 ""While panamaxes and handysizes ... look interestingly well
balanced compared with the demand growth.""

 By Jeff Mason and Louise Egan
 WASHINGTON/TORONTO, June 23 (Reuters) - World leaders will
warn this week against counting complacently on a global
economic recovery while admitting sickly public finances could
hurt long-term growth, a draft G20 document shows.
 The European Union will push for taxes on banks and
financial transactions, a proposal likely to draw opposition
from Canada and other countries who say their banks weathered
the financial crisis well and should not be penalized.
 The Group of 20, which meets in Toronto this weekend, has
claimed credit for a strong, unified crisis response that
helped prevent a global recession in 2008 from becoming a
depression. But as the economy recovers, G20 unity is fraying.
 The group still must forge consensus on controversial
topics such as how quickly to shrink government deficits, how
best to strengthen banks so that they can withstand any new
downturn, and how to harmonize financial regulatory reforms.
 The draft version of the summit communique, obtained by
Reuters and dated June 11, reflected divisions over which
policy priority ought to take precedence -- supporting
still-shaky growth or shrinking budget deficits. (For more on
the draft, see [ID:nN23177602])
 Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said governments must
plan for austerity but not rush to belt-tighten all at once.
 ""It's a question of getting the balance right,"" Carney said
in an interview with Reuters Insider. [ID:nN23199106]
 ""Nobody should be looking to balance their budget next
year. Nor should anybody be in a position where they think
there's no need to start laying out a plan to stabilize their
debt position, the United States included.""
 Europe's simmering debt troubles served as a reminder that
when markets lose faith in governments' ability and willingness
to rein in spending, borrowing costs soar and countries are
forced into swifter, harsher fiscal fixes.
 'UNEVEN AND FRAGILE' RECOVERY
 While the economy looks healthier than it did when G20
leaders met in Pittsburgh in September last year, there are
signs that the recovery may have hit a plateau.
 Unemployment remains high in the United States and Europe,
the U.S. housing market at the center of the financial crisis
remains weak, and a gauge of European services activity cooled
more than expected in June. [ID:nN23209668][ID:nLAG006315]
 The G20 draft said the recovery was ""uneven and fragile""
and warned: ""There is no room for complacency,"" it said.
 At the same time, it said ""fiscal challenges in many states
are creating market volatility, and could seriously threaten
the recovery and weaken prospects for long-term growth.""
 The United States has warned against withdrawing supports
too soon, mindful of when the government slammed the brakes on
spending in the 1930s, prolonging the Great Depression.
 ""We must demonstrate a commitment to reducing long-term
deficits, but not at the price of short-term growth,"" U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House economic
adviser Lawrence Summers wrote in the Wall Street Journal.
 ""Without growth now, deficits will rise further and
undermine future growth,"" they wrote.
 European countries, led by Germany, argue that fiscal
restraint breeds confidence which in turn sustains growth.
 An EU diplomat said fiscal targets proposed by Canada were
too modest and some rich G20 countries should do more.
 ""We are wary of these targets. We are more ambitious than
that,"" the diplomat said. ""This is a minimum, a number of
advanced economies should go further than that.""
[ID:nLDE65M22J]
 Canada wants the G20 to agree this week to halve budget
deficits by 2013 and stabilise or start reducing debt-to-GDP
ratios by 2016.
 The draft document predated China's surprise announcement
on Saturday that it was loosening its grip on its yuan
currency, a move that seemed timed to defuse a G20 fight. The
final communique may refer to China's move but also call on
Beijing to do more to break its dependence on exports.
 REFORMING BANK RULES
 The G20 document said further steps were needed to ""address
the underlying causes of the global financial crisis and
promote more responsible and transparent banking sectors,"" a
nod to the heavy lifting still needed on regulatory reform.
 The U.S. Congress was racing to finalize a reform bill, but
one of the biggest issues -- bank capital rules -- was left to
the G20 to agree. The United States wants tougher requirements
phased in beginning in 2012, but some European countries have
pressed for a slower implementation.
 Geithner and Summers praised Europe's decision to publish
results of bank ""stress tests"" designed to show how well
financial firms could withstand further losses, but said it was
critical that banks hold more capital.
 The European Union formally requested in a letter on
Wednesday that the G20 explore a tax on banks and financial
transactions. [ID:nLDE65M0TL]
 Canada has led opposition to bank taxes, arguing that there
is no need for a one-size-fits-all rule because some countries
weathered the financial crisis well.
 The draft said the G20 would push for conclusion of a
long-delayed world trade deal and would pledge to extend a
commitment not to raise barriers to investment or trade for
three more years, through 2013.
 ""Where any protectionist measures have been enacted in the
context of the economic crisis, we agree that these should be
lifted,"" the document said.
 The G20 groups the world's biggest economies and covers
two-thirds of the world's population. It includes Australia,
Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Korea,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey in addition to the big
European economies, the United States and Canada.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2010 10:26AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Think tanks revise up German growth forecasts," * Unemployment seen falling through 2011
 * Exports tipped to power growth comeback
 * Europe's biggest economy seen slowing in 2011
 
 (Adds Ifo forecast, comments)
 BERLIN, June 23 (Reuters) - German economic growth will be
stronger than expected in 2010, fuelled by a surge in global
trade which will help lower unemployment through 2011, two
leading economic think tanks forecast on Wednesday.
 Munich's Ifo institute said Europe's largest economy would
likely grow by 2.1 percent this year, with the RWI think tank in
Essen predicting expansion of 1.9 percent. The RWI forecast was
half a percentage point higher than a March estimate.
 Despite a European debt crisis which is prompting major
spending cuts by several governments, Germany's manufacturing
sector has rebounded from the country's sharpest postwar
recession in 2009, driven by foreign demand for its goods.
 ""The deficit countries most badly hit by a lack of
confidence on financial markets have embarked upon drastic
consolidation measures and are likely to remain mired in
recession this year,"" Ifo said in a statement.
 ""By contrast, the German economy remains on the road to
recovery. Due to its specific export focus the German economy
was hit particularly hard by the previous recession, and it's
now profiting to a special degree from the global recovery.""
 The RWI noted that the debt crisis, which has weakened the
euro against the dollar, was helping the German model.
 ""The German economy has significantly picked up this
spring,"" the RWI said. ""This has been fuelled particularly by
exports, which are profiting from the unexpectedly strong
pick-up in global trade as well as the euro's depreciation.""
 The latest forecasts reflect a growing conviction that the
German economy is on track to make good some of the ground it
lost last year, when it contracted by some five percent.
 German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said on Wednesday
the economy could grow by more than the 1.4 percent the
government has officially forecast for this year.
 The predictions suggest unemployment could fall to near
seven percent next year, taking the jobless rate to a level not
seen since the boom following German reunification in 1990.
 At a conference held by Germany's chambers of industry and
commerce (DIHK) on Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel described
the group's forecast that the economy would grow in 2010 by 2.3
percent as ""sensational"" and encouraging for the future.
 Next year, when Germany aims to begin implementing a round
of savings cuts due to total 80 billion euros ($107 billion)
over four years, economic growth should slow, the think tanks
said.
 Ifo forecast that gross domestic product would grow by 1.5
percent in 2011. RWI forecast expansion of 1.7 percent.
 Among those fearing the impact of austerity measures are
building firms, the ZDH industry group said on Wednesday.
 The group forecast that sales in the construction sector
would fall by around two percent to 80 billion euros in 2011
after a decline of around 0.7 percent this year.

 By Michael Christie
 BAGHDAD, June 23 (Reuters) - Trade Bank of Iraq's chairman
said Sunday's suicide bomb attack on his bank and one on the
central bank a week earlier were aimed at deterring investment
Iraq desperately needs as it claws its way out of war.
 Hussein al-Uzri still bears the burn scars on his hand from
an earlier attempt to blow him up in his armoured car. So he
wasn't all that surprised when two suicide bombers rammed cars
laden with explosives into the gates of his state-sector bank. 
 The attack was clearly aimed at destroying an institution
trying to play a leading role in wooing foreign investors just
as massive oil projects appeared to be opening the door for
other sectors, he told Reuters in an interview.
 ""The government cannot continue to be involved in all these
investments,"" Uzri said. ""Iraq has to have private investment.""
 Iraq's infrastructure needs are daunting after 30 years of
war, sanctions and neglect.
 Roads, railways, the electricity grid, ports, housing and
basic industry has to be almost rebuilt from scratch. To that
end, the National Investment Commission has put together a ""wish
list"" of 750 projects that alone require $600 billion.
 Iraqis had hoped a March 7 parliamentary vote would set
their country on a path to stability and prosperity seven years
after the U.S.-led invasion kicked off sectarian warfare and a
fierce Sunni Islamist-led insurgency.
 Overall violence has fallen sharply, and deals signed with
global oil majors hold the promise of making Iraq capable of
pumping at near Saudi levels -- 12 million barrels per day --
within seven years.
 But politicians have made little progress since the election
on agreeing on a coalition government, and there is a faint but
growing possibility that no government will formed by October or
November.
 ""I hope it will not extend that far because of course the
longer it takes for a government to be formed the more people
will fear instability and insecurity,"" Uzri said.
 ""And foreign investors of course look for both in order to
come into the country,"" he said at his home in a high-security
neighbourhood of Baghdad.
 Tussles for power and opposition from some former allies to
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's ambitions for a second term have
prevented Shi'ite Muslim-led political ranks from forging ahead
in coalition talks.
 The election leader, ex-Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's
cross-sectarian Iraqiya bloc, which secured strong backing from
the Sunni minority, has failed to win others to its side.
 The longer the power vacuum lasts, the longer the delays to
needed legislation and banking and investment reforms, Uzri
said.
 ""Plus of course for the average Iraqi these delays are quite
devastating,"" he said.
 At least two people have been killed in violent protests
over power shortages in recent days as summer temperatures soar
and public frustration grows over the political squabbling.

 * Mexico competes with China on low-wage factory goods
 By Jason Lange
 MEXICO CITY, June 23 (Reuters) - Mexico, which competes
directly with China to sell electronics and autoparts to the
United States, looks like a clear winner in the Asian giant's
plan to strengthen its currency.
 China this week started revaluing the yuan , which
could make its exports more expensive and its imports cheaper.
Economists debate whether this will help or hurt the Chinese
economy and with it Latin America, which sells China
commodities like copper and iron ore.
 But Mexico, which is not a major commodities player,
probably wins out no matter what because more than any other
nation it competes with China in low-wage manufacturing.
 Hundreds of Mexican factories have closed since China
entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 and quickly became
a global exporting power, eclipsing Mexico as the United
States' No. 2 trade partner in 2006.
 Mexico, which itself joined the exporting big leagues when
it entered the North American Free Agreement (NAFTA) with the
United States and Canada in 1994, has complained that China was
using a weak currency to help its manufacturers.
 ""Now we will have an advantage,"" said Cesar Castro, a
manager at Jabil, which produces BlackBerry smartphones in
Mexico for Canada's Research in Motion  .
 Castro expects rising Chinese labor costs will further
erode China's edge over Mexico. ""The stronger yuan is going to
make their lives more difficult,"" he said.
 At the same time, it is unclear how much China will let the
yuan strengthen, and policymakers say the revaluation will be
gradual.
 CURRENCY EDGE
 Mexico has shown recently that favorable exchange rates can
boost its exports relative to China.
 Mexico's peso  has lost about 20 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since the global financial crisis
erupted in late 2008.
 That has helped Mexico's share of U.S. imports of goods and
services to rise to 10.3 percent in the first three months of
this year from 9.3 percent a year earlier. China's share has
fallen to 13.6 percent from 14.3 percent over the same period.
 China's plan to revalue ""is positive for Mexico because it
will continue to gain market share in the U.S.,"" said Morgan
Stanley economist Gray Newman.
 Even economists who think a stronger yuan will hurt global
growth see Mexico coming out ahead.
 A group of researchers from the Inter-American Development
Bank, Cambridge University and Rutgers University think a
stronger yuan will slow economic growth in the United States,
Europe and Latin America.
 Mexico, however, was the only Latin American country that
would see growth boosted in their model.
 ""The reason why Mexico is different is essentially because
it is in the free trade area (with the United States),"" said
IADB economist Alessandro Rebucci.
 At the same time, Rebucci said gains made because of better
currency terms should not be celebrated too much in Mexico,
which has lagged behind China in producing more sophisticated
goods.
 While China has been investing more in education and
attracts research and development projects, Mexico has put off
changes to tax laws that would allow it to improve its creaky
schools, roads and ports.
 ""A lot of China's exports are high-end and it's not just a
matter of increasing or decreasing the price (through
adjustments in exchange rates),"" Rebucci said, noting that
Mexico was not in position to compete with China in areas like
battery technology and computer chips.
 ""Somebody else will compete in that,"" he said.

 * Li & Fung sees end to China's low-cost era
 * Firms mitigate labour risks by tapping inland workforces
 
 By James Pomfret
 GANZHOU, China, June 23 (Reuters) - With the yuan now
climbing again, factories in China's coastal export hubs are
fretting that a stronger currency will compound a sharp rise in
wage and production costs.
 But an abundant supply of cheaper workers means that plants
sprinkled in the interior are somewhat insulated from the
surging wage demands that have sparked a series of
headline-grabbing strikes in the powerhouse province of
Guangdong.
 Take Ganzhou, a newly emerging industrial region in Jiangxi
province, just to the north of Guangdong.
 ""Factories are moving inland not only to find workers and to
reduce manfuacturing costs, but also to expand their business to
tap domestic demand and develop the mainland China market,"" said
Kong Xiangzhong, the head of a new LED lighting factory in
Ganzhou.
 The trend for factories to move inland has been unfolding
for many years, but the shift away from coastal hubs like the
Pearl River Delta could gather pace given unusually sharp rises
in manufacturing costs this year.
 A recent survey by Hong Kong's Trade Development Council
found that rising wages, higher materials and energy costs,
inflation and yuan appreciation were all eroding the margins of
factories run by Hong Kong manufacturers in China.
 Wage costs had jumped by about 17 percent over the past six
months, adding around four percent to six percent to total
production costs, the report found.
""Everything seems to be going against manufacturers right now,""
Bruce Rockowitz, the president of global sourcing giant Li &
Fung, told Reuters Insider television.
 ""I think this is a structural problem that's going to
continue into next year and beyond,"" added Rockowitz, whose firm
supplies consumer goods for a raft of clients including Wal-Mart
Inc, the world's largest retailer.
 Declaring a possible end to China's low-cost era, Rockowitz
said the price of Chinese goods stood to rise 20 percent.
 He said Li & Fung would source increasingly from China's
interior, particularly to the north and west. Industrial
clusters have already taken root in places like Chengdu, capital
of the southwestern province of Sichuan.
 Ganzhou, in southern Jiangxi, lacks the scale or limelight
of more prominent inland industrial zones. But, standing at the
crossroads of three of southern China's most economically
vibrant provinces, it has big ambitions.
 The city recently built a new airport and it has rapidly
upgraded road and rail networks to link it to southern ports and
supply chains.
 ""I think in five years' time, the number of enterprises
settling in our Ganzhou Development Zone will reach 800 to
1,000. We already have 330 companies here,"" said Zeng Weilin,
the zone's vice director.
 Unperturbed by the global slowdown, Zeng expects his
region's output to quadruple within five years.
 While the scrapping of the yuan's peg to the dollar had been
on the cards for months, Saturday's announcement has intensified
the unease gripping China's vast manufacturing sector.
 The impact of a gradually strengthening exchange rate --
which is what most economists expect -- will not be uniform.
 Heavy industries reliant on commodity imports stand to gain,
while sectors like office equipment and textiles makers may lose
out given their export-oriented nature and predominantly
domestic supply chains.
 Even a relatively mild five percent appreciation of the yuan
could cause losses for many firms, according to a Reuters poll
conducted at China's top trade fair in April.
 As the supply of labour tightens on the seaboard and
workers' demands for more pay become more shrill, manufacturers
are turning to populous places like Ganzhou with big commuter
belts.
 Counting its surrounding counties, Ganzhou boasts a
population of eight million.
 ""There's no problem in finding workers,"" said Kong, the
factory owner. ""People here are more stable and they don't move
around as frequently. Most of the workers come from the area,
which makes it more reliable for the factories ... training
costs will be lower too,"" he added.
 Kong acknowledged that factories in the interior have to
cope with higher transport costs and underdeveloped supply
chains.
 Yet he said the cost advantages were still compelling enough
to help sustain the competitiveness of Chinese manufacturing in
the face of strong rivalry from the likes of Vietnam.

 The business confidence index, often referred to as the

 By Gilbert Kreijger
 AMSTERDAM, June 23 (Reuters) - MalaNysia's central bank
governor said on Wednesday she did not expect to intervene in
foreign exchange markets following China's announcement of a
more flexible policy on the yuan.
 China said over the weekend it would allow its currency
greater flexibility, strengthening Malaysia's ringgit versus the
dollar, but Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said
that Malaysia would stick to its exchange rate policy and saw
limited impact in Asia.
 ""This is not expected to have implications on the region in
terms of impact on financial markets, including foreign exchange
markets, in the region,"" Zeti told Reuters.
 ""We will continue with our exchange rate regime that we have
in place. It has served us very well,"" said Zeti, who was
visiting the Netherlands en route to the Bank for International
Settlements' annual meeting in Switzerland later this week.
 Zeti said the ringgit's appreciation over the past year --
it is up almost 9 percent to trade at 3.231 to the dollar --
reflects an improvement of Malaysia's economy, which grew by
10.1 percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace in a decade.

 ""We will promote orderly market conditions. Therefore -- for
the most time of course -- it does not involve any
interventionist policy,"" she added.
 Zeti said euro zone debt woes had not posed a threat to
market stability and only when there was a potential disruption
or disorderly market conditions would Bank Negara consider
intervening in the currency market.
 ""We were there to stabilise the market condition during that
period -- during Lehman's fall and the period that followed.
That was to prevent depreciation,"" Zeti said.
 
 GLOBAL GROWTH UNCERTAINTY
 She said, however, euro zone debt problems and developments
in the United States were creating uncertainty for global
economic growth.
 Malaysia's central bank has hiked interest rates at two
consecutive meetings this year, each time by 25 basis points so
that its key rate now stands at 2.5 percent, and has repeatedly
said that rates must ""normalise"".
 ""There are risks to the external conditions and we do have
to take that into account in determining the extent to which
further normalisation will take place,"" Zeti said.
 ""We've also said that for the rest of this year monetary
policy will remain supportive of the economy and therefore we
would not be moving into a tightening phase. This is because we
assess inflation will remain modest during this year.""
 A low interest rate could push money into ""informal sectors""
or high-risk activities or create asset bubbles that may hurt
the economy when conditions change, Zeti said.
 ""The process of normalisation is aimed at removing the risk
of a buildup of financial imbalances. We believe such financial
imbalances could result in a risk to our growth.""
 At the same time, Malaysian exports are not expected to
suffer from a stronger ringgit because of their focus on
competitiveness, innovation and productivity, Zeti said.
""Our export sector has also been able to adjust to manage
their position better. We have also removed many rules that give
them greater flexibility in managing their foreign financial
transactions."" she said.
 Zeti said the government, which had a 2009 budget deficit of
7 percent of gross domestic product, would have the opportunity
to start cutting subsidies on food, petrol, electricity and gas,
as it announced last month.
 ""The government can take time but it is now that we have
achieved stable economic conditions it is good to start the
process,"" she added.

 * Says leaders agree to extend trade commitment by 3 years
(adds quotes from text, background, byline)
 By Jeff Mason
 WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 major
economies will warn against complacency in tackling the global
economic crisis and say that sickly public accounts could hit
long-term growth, a draft G20 document shows.
 The draft version of the summit communique, obtained by
Reuters and drawn up ahead of a G20 leaders meeting this
weekend in Toronto, reflected the different views within the
G20 on how to proceed with economic policy.
 The draft, dated June 11, said the recovery was ""uneven and
fragile"" with unemployment at unacceptable levels. ""There is no
room for complacency,"" it said.
 At the same time, it said ""fiscal challenges in many states
are creating market volatility, and could seriously threaten
the recovery and weaken prospects for long-term growth.""
 The United States has argued for continued stimulus
spending by governments to ensure the global economic recovery
does not fizzle out.
 Other countries, such as Germany, intend to cut spending
quickly in order to bring down public debts and deficits.
 ""Further actions are still required to address the
underlying causes of the global financial crisis and promote
more responsible and transparent banking sectors,"" it said,
without spelling out further details.
 Reforms of banking around the world, along with ways to
ensure the recovery of the global economy, are high on the
agenda of this weekend's summit.
 The draft said the G20 would push for conclusion of a
long-delayed world trade deal and would pledge to extend a
commitment not to raise barriers to investment or trade for
three more years, through 2013.
 G20 nations converge on Canada on June 26-27 as Europe
fights a debt crisis and the United States battles persistently
high joblessness.
 The summit also comes days after China dropped the
controversial peg of its currency to the dollar, a step long
called for by the United States and other countries as an
important part of the push to rebalance the global economy.
 The draft communique is likely to be negotiated and amended
by leaders at the summit.
 The G20 groups the world's biggest economies and covers
two-thirds of the world's population. In includes Australia,
Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Korea,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey in addition to the big
European economies, the United States and Canada.
 TRADE, ECONOMIC PROGRESS
 One concrete agreement among the leaders involved trade.
The group praised itself for avoiding the temptation to put up
trade barriers during the economic meltdown and said it would
continue to work to bring them down.
 ""We renew for a further three years, until the end of 2013,
our commitment to refrain from raising new barriers to
investment or trade in goods and services, implementing World
Trade Organization (WTO)-inconsistent measures to stimulate
exports, or imposing new export restrictions or other
barriers,"" it said.
 ""Where any protectionist measures have been enacted in the
context of the economic crisis, we agree that these should be
lifted.""
 It also pledged again for a renewed push to complete world
trade talks known as the Doha Round.
 ""Bringing the WTO Doha Development Round to a successful
conclusion as soon as possible is more important than ever,"" it
said. ""Each of us is ready to make contributions, and we pledge
to empower fully our negotiators to undertake the give-and-take
necessary to move into endgame negotiations.""
 The leaders would their direct trade ministers to present a
plan outlining the ""way forward"" in the talks at the next G20
summit in November in Seoul, it said.
 The draft touched on moves to fight corruption and climate
change, but it focused mostly on the economy, including the
bright spots since the last G20 met last in Pittsburgh.
 ""Our efforts to date have borne good results. Fiscal and
monetary stimulus has helped restore private demand and
lending, and we have taken strong steps toward increasing the
stability of our financial systems,"" the draft said.

 * Bank says risks roughly balanced, rates seen flat for now
 * Markets unmoved
 
 (Adds comments from news conference)
 By Jana Mlcochova and Michael Winfrey
 PRAGUE, June 23 (Reuters) - The Czech central bank left
interest rates unchanged on Wednesday as expected and said they
could stay stable for the near future as the country creeps
through an export-driven recovery marked by weak price growth.
 Rate-setters left the main two-week repo rate 
at 0.75 percent, below the euro zone's 1 percent benchmark rate.
All 17 analysts in a Reuters poll had said the bank would hold
fire after a series of cuts that ended in May.
 They expect the next move to be a 25 basis point hike. Five
expect the rise during 2010, while nine see it in 2011.
 Bank Governor Zdenek Tuma, presiding over his last meeting
before he quits at the end of the month, said risks were roughly
balanced between the anti-inflationary impact of developments in
the euro zone and price pressure tied to a crown currency that
is weaker than the bank's forecast.
 ""It is hard to predict the next development in interest
rates. It depends on the development of risks,"" Tuma told a news
conference. 
 ""At the moment they are not particularly significant. So for
the nearest term, rate stability is probably most likely, but it
is impossible to predict the future development.""
 Markets were unmoved after the widely expected decision,
with the crown  unchanged at 25.725 to the euro, up 0.2
percent on the day. Bonds and money market rates were also
unchanged though Czech 1-year interest rate swaps fell to
1.27/35 pct from 1.30/36 seen before the news conference.
 Forward rate agreements , contracts betting on
future changes in interest rates, price in no change for the
rest of the year and about an 80 percent chance of a quarter
point hike in the first three months of 2011.
 Czech growth has been harder hit than neighbouring Poland in
the global financial crisis, but they have easily avoided the
sort of debt, currency or fiscal crisis that drove some others
in eastern Europe to seek IMF aid. 
 Hungary's central bank also held rates stable on Monday, at
a record low 5.25 percent, and gave no signal about the
possibility of further rate cuts. [ID:nLDE65K0MM] Poland is
expected to keep rates unchanged at 3.5 percent next week.
 
 MICROSCOPIC CHANGE
 Tuma said the board saw the balance of risks to its
forecasts to be slightly anti-inflationary, but he said the tilt
was so ""microscopic"" that saying the risk were balanced was a
better formulation.
 Some analysts said latest developments tilted the balance of
risks to the bank's inflation forecast to the upside, though not
enough to hike.
 ""Since the last central bank meeting, a string of data has
developed in a pro-inflationary direction in relation to the
central bank's assumptions,"" said Raiffeisen Bank analyst Michal
Brozka. 
 ""On the other hand, chances for fiscal austerity have risen,
which is an argument to keep rates low for a longer period of
time.""
 Inflation in May came in 0.3 percentage points above the
bank's forecast. But adjusted readings excluding fuels show
price growth driven by demand was negative. Import prices, too,
had a disinflationary effect, the bank said this month.
 Unemployment fell below 9 percent for the first time in half
a year, possibly helping household consumption, which surprised
on the upside, according to first quarter GDP data.

 * Safeguard differences torpedoed Doha breakthrough efforts
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 23 (Reuters) - A controversial plan to allow
developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily to cope with a
destabilising flood of food imports or drop in food prices would
actually have little impact on trade flows, a new study shows.
 Disagreements over the ""special safeguard mechanism"" were
the immediate cause of the collapse in July 2008 of the last
major attempt to conclude the World Trade Organization's
long-running Doha round to open up world trade.
 Since then, negotiations have continued at the technical
level to determine just how it could work in practice.
 All 153 WTO members agree there should be a safeguard to
help developing countries and make the global trading system
fairer, but they differ widely over the way it would work.
 Many developing countries with large numbers of poor farmers
such as India say they need to be able to respond quickly to
surges in imports that could put local producers out of
business, damaging their long-term ability to produce food.
 Food exporters from the United States to Costa Rica say they
fear the safeguard could be abused to choke off normal growth in
trade, especially if importers are allowed to raise tariffs
above today's levels, let alone any lower levels agreed in a
Doha deal, as one proposal would allow.
 A simulation by the International Centre for Trade and
Sustainable Development, a non-government organisation, shows
that on the basis of the latest proposals, tabled in 2008, the
safeguard had little impact, especially when prices fell.
 ""The special safeguard mechanism had limited effectiveness
even under ideal conditions,"" said Raul Montemayor, author of
the study.
 Montemayor, national manager of the Philippines organisation
Federation of Free Farmers' Cooperatives (FFFCI), said more work
needed to be done on the price safeguard, which would be useless
unless countries were allowed to raise tariffs above current
""pre-Doha"" levels.
 Even if they were, the safeguard would only be triggered
half as often as by volume surges, according to the simulation
based on monthly import data for 27 products in six countries --
China, Ecuador, Fiji, Indonesia, Philippines and Senegal.
 The study showed the safeguard could only be used in one
third or fewer of cases when an import surge occurred, and was
effective in narrowing price gaps between domestic and import
prices in only a quarter of cases.

 (Adds central bank governor comments)
 By Mia Shanley
 STOCKHOLM, June 23 (Reuters) - Iceland's central bank eased
monetary policy as expected on Wednesday, trimming its key rate
to 8.0 percent, and said it could lift capital controls further
this year with much of the work done by mid-2011.
 Iceland took a beating during the crisis in 2008 and its top
banks collapsed under a weight of debt. Investors fled, the
crown slid and the country had to take $10 billion bailout from
the IMF and Nordic states, including funds to repay depositors
in failed Icelandic banks in Britain and the Netherlands.
 The central bank also took borrowing costs to a record high
of 18 percent and imposed strict capital controls to protect its
currency. It started to ease restrictions late last year, but
has estimated that investors holding up to 300 billion crowns
($2.35 billion) of assets would be impatient to exit the market.
 Mar Gudmundsson told Reuters by telephone that currency
controls could be mostly removed by mid to late next year.
 He said the dispute over its so-called ""Icesave"" debt with
Britain and the Netherlands had created some uncertainty about
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan review.
 On when the crown would be fully tradeable, Gudmundsson
said: ""Maybe, conceivably, it might be done a year from when we
start. It's conceivable that we will have done the bulk of
liberalisation by this time next summer, or autumn of 2011.""
 The central bank has been able to cut rates gradually after
the bailout and the further easing came after cooler annual
inflation, a stronger crown and brighter economic signs.
 Gudmundsson said the next stage of currency liberalisation
-- removing controls on longer-dated securities -- could come
""some weeks"" after the country's IMF aid review.
 That could come in late August or even early October
depending on Icesave, he said.
 Icelandic firms remain largely cut off from overseas capital
markets due to the restrictions, hampering growth.
 4Cast said in a note that policy would be restrained by the
domestic funding position, calling the aid programme by the IMF
a ""key milestone"" for policy and controls.
 
 BOTTOMING OUT
 There are signs the economy may have bottomed out. Iceland's
gross domestic product grew 0.6 percent in the first quarter
from the fourth quarter for an annual drop of 6.8 percent,
preliminary numbers showed this month. [ID:nLDE6570WZ]
 Exports have been rising and consumers are more optimistic.
 ""We think there's room for them to continue to lower the
interest rates going forward,"" said Arvid Bohm, emerging markets
strategist at SEB. 
 Conditions, however, remain tough and the central bank will
want to ensure the recovery takes firm hold.
 Bohm said SEB expected the central bank to stop its
loosening campaign at around 5.5 percent sometime this year.
 Any further liberalisation of capital controls would have to
come hand in hand with stronger developments in the domestic
economy and backed by full investor confidence in the crown,
lest the central bank risk another run on the currency.
 The government must find a quick solution to the $5 billion
in debt it owes to the Netherlands and Great Britain after
voters rejected a deal in a referendum in March.
 A spokeswoman at the Finance Ministry said informal talks
with the British and the Dutch were ongoing but that no formal
meetings were planned.
 The central bank also moved this week to replenish reserves,
announcing plans on Tuesday to draw on bilateral credit lines to
the tune of 639 million euros set up with Denmark, Finland,
Norway, Poland and Sweden to supplement its reserves.

 (Adds quotes, background)
 BERLIN, June 23 (Reuters) - German's budget savings policy
risks destroying the European project and a collapse of the euro
cannot be ruled out, billionaire investor George Soros said in a
newspaper interview released on Wednesday.
 ""German policy is a danger for Europe, it could destroy the
European project,"" he told German weekly Die Zeit.
 Soros, who earned $1 billion in 1992 by betting against the
British pound, added that he ""could not rule out a collapse of
the euro"".
 ""If the Germans don't change their policy, their exit from
the currency union would be helpful for the rest of Europe,"" he
said.
 Chancellor AngelaMerkel unveiled plans earlier this month
for 80 billion euros ($107 billion) in budget cuts over the next
four years -- a package she hopes will bring Germany's
structural deficit within European Union limits by 2013.
 ""Right now the Germans are dragging their neighbours into
deflation, which threatens a long phase of stagnation. And that
leads to nationalism, social unrest and xenophobia. Democracy
itself could be at risk,"" Soros said.
 ""Germany is globally isolated ... Why don't they let their
salaries rise? That would help other EU states to pick up.""
 Merkel on Monday defended her budget cut plans after U.S.
President Barack Obama preached patience in clamping down on
public spending. A German government official said on Tuesday
Berlin did not expect to come under pressure at a G20 summit in
Toronto this weekend to provide fresh stimulus measures.

(Adds analyst and market reaction)
 By David Milliken and Christina Fincher
 LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - One Bank of England policymaker
voted to raise interest rates from their record low this month
in a surprise split with the majority for leaving policy
unchanged, prompting speculation of a rate hike this year.
 Sterling surged half a cent against the dollar and short
sterling futures tumbled as investors reckoned the first call
for a rise in nearly two years threatened bets official
borrowing costs would stay on hold until 2011.
 But analysts said that especially after the new government
on Tuesday delivered the most austere budget in a generation, it
was unlikely that other members of the Monetary Policy Committee
would support policymaker Andrew Sentance quickly.
 ""The UK is struggling to recover from the deepest recession
in at least 30 years and now is not the time to raise the heat
on monetary policy, when fiscal restraint is going to be
significant,"" said Peter Dixon of Commerzbank.
 ""My guess is that Sentance will remain in the minority for
some time to come.""
 The Monetary Policy Committee minutes published on Wednesday
showed rate-setters believed demand momentum could be stronger
than previously thought, and that they were split on the extent
to which spare capacity left over after Britain's deep recession
would bear down on inflation.
 Sentance voted for rates to rise to 0.75 percent from their
record low of 0.5 percent, though he backed the MPC's unanimous
vote to keep the stock of quantitative easing purchases steady
at 200 billion pounds ($296 billion).
 The move puts the former British Airways chief economist on
a collision course with BoE Governor Mervyn King, who stressed
last week how monetary policy had to take account of fiscal
tightening and financial fragility.
 ""The clearer divisions that had opened up since the end of
last year were going to prompt somebody to vote for a hike, but
we didn't think that would be until August at the earliest,""
said Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.
 
 ABOVE TARGET
 A big question remains how the MPC will react to finance
minister George Osborne's austere budget, which will dent growth
by slashing government spending by a fifth over five years and
push up inflation next year with a sales tax rise.
 But in their June 9-10 meeting -- before Tuesday's budget --
there were signs that it was not just Sentance who was worried
about the failure of British inflation to fall as rapidly as
that in the United States and the euro zone.
 ""Reading the minutes as a whole, the balance of opinion has
edged in a more hawkish direction,"" Walker said.
 Sentance's was the first call for a UK rate rise since
August 2008, and it was the first split decision since November
when one policymaker called for more quantitative easing than
was ultimately agreed.
 He argued that inflation had proved resilient in the
aftermath of Britain's deep recession, casting doubt on the
BoE's prediction that spare capacity would be enough to bring
inflation back to target.
 Consumer price inflation hit a 17-month high of 3.7 percent
in April, and fell only to 3.4 percent in May, remaining well
above the central bank's 2 percent target.
 The central view in the BoE's May Inflation Report was that
British inflation had been temporarily lifted by a rise in sales
tax in January and the lingering effects of currency weakness,
and that CPI was on track to return to target by early 2011.
 The BoE also noted that the momentum for demand might be
stronger than previously thought, with recent indicators
suggesting that underlying GDP growth was only a little below
average in the first half of 2010.
 Short-term public inflation expectations were rising, but
the BoE saw enhanced downside risks to growth and inflation from
ongoing sovereign debt worries in the euro zone and the region's
acceleration of fiscal tightening.
 MPC members will be mindful of the last time the BoE
considered raising rates in the summer of 2008, when inflation
was accelerating due to an oil price spike and Britain appeared
to have escaped the U.S. subprime crisis relatively unscathed.
 The central bank opted not to raise interest rates --
fortuitously, as Lehman Brothers' collapse in September caused
an even sharper downturn to the world economy.
 The normal nine-member MPC was down to eight this month,
because a replacement for Kate Barker, who left at the end of
May, has yet to be found.

Policy Committee was split 7-1 on its decision to leave rates
unchanged this month after one member called for a rate rise,
minutes of the Bank's June 9-10 meeting showed on Wednesday.
 This was the first call for a UK rate rise since August
2008, and comes as a surprise to economists, who expected
another unanimous decision.
 BoE policymaker Andrew Sentance voted for rates to rise to
0.75 percent from their record low of 0.5 percent, though he

 Inflation hit a 17-month high of 3.7 percent in April, and
fell only to 3.4 percent in May, remaining well above the
central bank's 2 percent target.
 Other members were happy to leave policy steady, saying that
the balance of risks to inflation was not enough to justify a
change in policy, especially given the scope of fiscal
tightening that could lie ahead.
 ""Uncertainty over the nature and scope of the fiscal
measures to be announced in the forthcoming Budget would be
resolved by the time of the Committee's next meeting,"" the
minutes noted.
 The BoE met before finance minister George Osborne announced
a rise in value-added tax in Tuesday's Budget, as part of an
ambitious package of tax rises and spending cuts to reduce
Britain's record budget deficit.
 In June's meeting, the BoE worried about the risk of a rise
in indirect taxation putting further upward pressure on
inflation and public price expectations.
 The BoE also noted that the momentum to demand might be
stronger than previously thought, with recent indicators
suggesting that underlying GDP growth was only a little below
average in the first half of 2010.
 However, the BoE saw enhanced downside risks to growth and
inflation from ongoing sovereign debt worries in the euro zone
and the region's response of accelerated fiscal tightening.

FTSEurofirst 300 index 0.4 percent lwoer by 1020 GMT.
 Financial stocks were among the top losers on concerns about
Europe's banking sector after French bank Credit Agricole
pushed back profit targets for its struggling Greek unit
Emporiki and said it would take a 400 million euro ($536.7
million) write-down as Greece fights its debt load.
 The benchmark European index is up more than 62 percent from
a lifetime low on March 9, 2009, as major economies return to
growth. But it is only up 0.5 percent for 2010, having stumbled
in April and May when worries about debt levels in Europe
escalated.
 Japan's Nikkei share average closed down almost 2 percent,
sliding to a one-week low and back towards a key support level.
World stocks as measured by MSCI were 0.4 percent down.
 U.S. stock futures rose 0.5 percent on some bargain-hunting
after the previous session's falls.
 U.S. stock indexes fell as much as 1.6 percent on Tuesday,
hit by the poor housing data and the S&P 500 moving below its
200 day-moving average, which has been seen as a key technical
support level for the markets' recent rally.
 
 U.S. RATES TO STAY NEAR ZERO PERCENT 
 The Federal Reserve, in a statement due at 1815 GMT, is
widely expected to hold rates near zero and reiterate its
commitment to keeping interest rates ""exceptionally low"" for an
""extended period.""
 Top U.S. economic leaders also warned that Group of 20
nations should beware of putting measures in place to curb
deficits so quickly that they risk pushing the global economy
back into recession.
 ""With advanced economies tightening their fiscal policies,
the risks of economic slowdown are rising,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 85.991, but up
from a one-month low of 85.091 marked on Monday.
 The euro was up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.2277,
having dipped to as low as $1.2244 earlier.
 Sterling extended gains after the UK's new government
outlined a tough budget which convinced investors the country is
serious about tackling its fiscal problems. 
 Adding to the pound's rally were Bank of England minutes
showing one policymaker had voted for a rise in interest rates
this month -- the first vote for tightening in nearly two years.
 The fall in equities helped support euro zone government
bonds and U.S. Treasuries. Benchmark 10-year German Bund yields
were down about three basis points at 2.668 percent while the
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was about one basis point
lower at 3.157 percent.
 Oil extended losses below $78 a barrel after U.S. industry
data showed an unexpected jump in crude and gasoline stocks, and
investors looked to government figures later in the day for
confirmation.
 U.S. crude for August delivery shed about 30 cents to $77.53
a barrel.

 By Andy Bruce
 LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - The sprightly expansion achieved
by euro zone services and manufacturing companies since spring
slowed slightly in June, according to a survey that cast growing
doubt on the strength of domestic demand.
 Markit's Eurozone Flash Services Purchasing Managers' Index,
based on surveys of around 2,000 firms ranging from hotels to
banks, fell to 55.4 in June from 56.2 in May -- its first
decline since February and below forecasts for 55.9.
 While the PMI is still firmly above the 50 mark dividing
growth from contraction, persistent worry about the fiscal
health of euro zone states and signs of dimming consumer demand
in keystone economy Germany may yet undermine a private sector
recovery.
 Survey compiler Markit said the data show the 16-nation euro
zone economy may have grown faster in the second quarter at
around 0.6 to 0.7 percent, compared to 0.2 percent in the first.
 ""However, the downturns in growth of output, new orders and
exports towards the end of the quarter suggest that economic
growth will moderate as we move into the second half of the
year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
 The services new business index showed slowing domestic
demand for the second month running in June, falling to 52.7
from 54.2 last month.
 And the pace of new orders growth among euro zone
manufacturers slipped for the third month in a row in June, with
the sub-index measuring this dipping to 55.8 from 56.5 last
month.
 While the output sub-index rose to 57.3 from 56.8, the
overall headline index for manufacturing edged down to 55.6 from
55.8 in May.
 ""It's partly a reflection of an extremly strong April, and
we didn't expect that rate of growth to continue for long,"" said
Markit's Williamson.
""Nevertheless, there are signs of weakening.""
 The composite PMI index, which combines the services and
manufacturing surveys and is often used to predict overall
growth, dipped to 56.0 in June from 56.4 last month.
 However, the employment index showed modest jobs growth for
the second month after a 22-month stretch of layoffs, with the
index rising to 50.6 from 50.5 in May.
 Economists polled by Reuters last week said the euro zone's
recovery from its worst ever recession shows scant sign of
gaining momentum over the next 18 months, with a one-in-four
chance of slipping back into recession.
 
 EXPORT DEPENDENCE
 Williamson picked out weak domestic demand in Germany as a
cause for concern, as the services new business index there fell
to 50.5 in June -- only marginally above the growth/contraction
divide. 
 Speaking before a G20 Summit earlier this month, U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said ""European surplus
countries"" -- which many took to mean Germany -- had to boost
domestic demand, which would lessen their reliance on cheap
exports to sustain recovery.
 Instead policymakers agreed to start cutting budgets,
representing a marked shift from April when they advocated more
time to allow unprecedented growth-boosting spending to do its
work.
 ""At this stage in the recovery, we'd want to see consumer
confidence lifting with greater spending on goods and services
in the euro area,"" said Markit's Williamson.
 ""That doesn't seem to be happening sufficiently at the
moment, so we're looking at growth weakening in the second half
of this year, probably.""
 The French services and manufacturing PMIs dipped slightly
too in June, although the surveys still show strong private
sector expansion there and continued outperformance of its euro
zone stablemates.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, June 23 (Reuters) - The euro held steady on
Wednesday but remained vulnerable as a recent risk rally
appeared to have run its course and on concerns about the euro
zone banking system.
 A sharp fall in U.S. stocks the previous day and a
subsequent drop in the Nikkei helped support the dollar and the
yen, which are favoured when risk aversion spikes and doubts
over the health of the global economy emerge.
 European shares were last down 0.7 percent.
 ""With advanced economies tightening their fiscal policies,
the risks of economic slowdown are rising,"" said Lee Hardman,
currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
 By 0728 GMT, the euro was up 0.1 percent from late U.S.
trading on Tuesday at $1.2279, having dipped to as low as
$1.2244 earlier.
 The euro is now hovering close to a support area near
$1.2255. That level marks a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the euro's recent rally from its four-year low of $1.1876 hit
in early June on trading platform EBS to a one-month high of
$1.2490 marked on Monday.
 A clear break below that level could open the way for a drop
towards $1.2145 to $1.2165, an area where the euro hit a number
of intraday lows in mid- to late-May, traders said.
 Worries about the euro zone's banking sector returned after
French bank Credit Agricole pushed back profit targets for its
struggling Greek unit Emporiki and said it will take a 400
million euro ($536.7 million) write-down as Greece fights its
debt load.
 That followed a ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas
by Fitch and S&P's announcement on Monday that it had raised
estimates for loan losses for Spain's banking sector.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 86.01, but up
from a one-month low of 85.091 marked on Monday.
 Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.1 percent at 90.39 yen.
 
 STERLING UP
 Sterling gained 0.4 percent against the dollar to trade at
$1.4868 in the wake of the new UK government's budget released
Tuesday, which investors concluded was tough enough to address
Britain's fiscal problems and keep rating agencies from
downgrading its sovereign debt.
 ""The pound has enjoyed a relief rally post-budget,"" analysts
at RBC Capital Markets said in a note. 
 Minutes of the Bank of England's June 9-10 policy meeting
are due out later in the day.
 Meanwhile, the Swiss franc extended gains, hovering near an
all-time high against the euro of 1.3585 francs on trading
platform EBS earlier in the Asian session.
 Market euphoria after China's decision to loosen the yuan's
23-month-old peg to the U.S. dollar at the weekend faded as
traders concluded China would keep adjustments limited.
 China's central bank set the yuan's daily mid-point at
6.8102 against the dollar on Wednesday, compared with 6.7980 on
Tuesday, which was its highest since the yuan's revaluation in
July 2005.
 ""China is introducing more two-way volatility into the
yuan,"" said BTM-UFJ's Hardman.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent at $0.8688, backing
away from a one-month high of $0.8860 hit earlier in the week.
 Market players will also keep an eye out on central bank
policy meetings. The Norges Bank's decision due out at 1200 GMT
is expected to show interest rates unchanged but a lower rate
trajectory going forward.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to keep rates on hold
and restate its intention to keep rates near zero for an
extended period.

 By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, June 23 (Reuters) - The yuan inched up on
Wednesday after the central bank nudged the mid-point higher,
but dollar buying by state-controlled banks suggested that
officials were trying to keep currency gains in check.
 The dollar purchases by big local banks were smaller than
the hefty buying on Tuesday, but the actions by the banks have
made it difficult for market players to sell the U.S. currency
for yuan by absorbing so much dollar supply.
 Traders said it appeared People's Bank of China was
operating through the state-controlled banks to limit the
yuan's rise, even while shying away from the direct
intervention often used in the past to reduce intraday
volatility.
 That suggested the PBOC still had a very heavy hand in
controlling trade even as it has allowed more two-way activity
in the 0.5 percent daily trading band since ditching the de
facto U.S. dollar peg over the weekend.
 Yuan trading settled down after two hectic days that saw
the currency jump to a post-revaluation high of 6.7900 but then
pull back sharply. Graphic on volatility:
http://r.reuters.com/gyx53m
 The yuan was at 6.8102 to the dollar in midday trade, flat
compared with the mid-point and up from a close at 6.8136. For
the week, the yuan has risen a mere 0.23 percent.
 ""The PBOC has once again proved that it has control over
the pace of yuan movements. No one wants to fight with the
central bank, so trading is becoming a sort of guessing game
about how the PBOC will let the yuan move,"" said a senior
trader at a big Chinese bank in Shanghai.
 A new framework is taking shape for the PBOC to control the
yuan after making clear over the weekend that it would not
allow sharp appreciation and ruling out a one-off revaluation.
 Some big Chinese banks are buying dollars in such large
amounts that they could not be acting on demand from clients or
for proprietary trading, traders said, leading to the
conclusion that they are buying on the PBOC's behalf.
 These banks also appear to be concentrating a large volume
of their deals in the final minutes of trading, with their
final dollar/yuan quotes helping the central bank to set the
tone for the following day's mid-point, the reference rate from
which the yuan can move up or down 0.5 percent.
 ""By effectively taking control of dollar supply and making
closing prices an important barometer for the yuan's movements,
the central bank is able to have its intentions clearly felt by
the market,"" said a North American dealer in Shanghai.
 TWO-WAY TRADE
 The yuan's daily mid-point partly reflected a mild rally in
the dollar index overnight, traders said.
 But the yuan mid-point was down from Tuesday's, which was
the highest since the yuan's revaluation in July 2005, as the
central bank had paved the way for a weakening of its reference
rate via state banks purchases of dollars on the spot market.
 Dealers said it would no longer be very difficult for the
market to guess the next day's mid-point, or more precisely,
the central bank's intention on yuan movements.
 But dealers added that the mid-point could also be wielded
on occasion as a ready weapon for the PBOC to control the
yuan's rises and falls during times of global market volatility
and emergencies. The PBOC consults with banks but keeps the
market in the dark as to how it sets the actual rate.
 Despite the cental bank's tight grip on the yuan, dealers
said state banks are now buying dollars at a much wider variety
of levels, a clear indication that the PBOC is creating a more
volatile exchange market.
 The yuan moved in a 45-pip range between 6.8070 and 6.8115
on Wednesday, which was down from 329 pips on Tuesday and 314
pips on Monday -- still a relatively wide given the market's
narrow movements of the past two years.
 The PBOC had largely confined the yuan's daily fluctuations
to just a few pips during the global financial crisis.
 ""It could be considered engineered volatility but it
nevertheless is a step towards a more market-oriented yuan
exchange rate,"" said a dealer at a European bank in Shanghai.
 Speculation about yuan appreciation eased in the offshore
market as well, with players becoming cautious about shorting
dollars, worried that Beijing's move was engineered primarily
to appease critics before the G20 summit late this week.
 Three-month dollar-yuan non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were quoted unchanged at 6.7550 bid in late morning trade,
implying a yuan rise of 0.82 percent in three months, as
measured from the central bank's spot mid-point.
 One-year NDFs edged lower to 6.6470 from Tuesday's close of
6.6500, with implied 12-month yuan appreciation rising slightly
to 2.46 percent from 2.23 percent the previous day.

 By Saikat Chatterjee
 HONG KONG, June 23 (Reuters) - Japan's plan to mend its
tattered finances and rein in its debt is supportive of its
credit rating and is a small step in the right direction, a
senior official at Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday.
 Japan, saddled with public debt approaching 200 percent of
its GDP, unveiled ambitious fiscal targets on Tuesday,
including a goal to halve the primary budget deficit by fiscal
2015.
 But the government conceded it could not meet the targets
even under the rosiest growth scenario, indicating it will have
to push through contentious tax hikes to fill deep fiscal gaps.
[ID:nTOE65L01H]
 ""In terms of the rating, it's a small step in the right
direction ... I think it will be supportive of the rating,""
Brian Coulton, head of global economics at the ratings agency
said in the Dealing Room, a Reuters chatroom.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan has made fiscal reform a top
priority ahead of a July 11 upper house election, vowing to
consider doubling the 5 percent sales tax, although not for at
least two or three years. [ID:nTFD006451].
 ""We're in a situation now where Japan's leadership, partly
reflecting shifts in global policymakers' focus on fiscal
consolidation, is taking this much more seriously than it seems
to have done in the past,"" Coulton said.
 He said there was plenty of scope in Japan to increase
taxes further because of the relatively low ratio of revenue to
GDP.
 Fitch has rated Japan's foreign currency debt AA and its
local currency debt at AA-minus, both with a stable outlook.
 Moody's on Tuesday also welcomed Japan's fiscal plan, while
adding it wanted to see more details. [ID:nSGC003626]
 On Europe, Coulton said the possibility of a break-up of
the euro zone was remote in the short and the medium term,
despite the sovereign debt issues plaguing the continent.
 ""Even in the worst case scenario, restructuring by one euro
member would not be the end of the euro in the same way that
restructuring by a U.S. state would not be the end of the
dollar,"" he said.
 Greece's fiscal plan was also a positive and recent
evidence suggested that they are on track, he said.
 Coulton said bank stress tests in Europe would be important
for calming market concerns on the health of these financial
institutions to the extent that they reinforce the adequacy of
their balance sheets.
 The European Union will stress-test its 25 biggest banks
under a scenario of slower economic growth and pressure on
sovereign debt holdings, a euro zone source said last week.
 ""In particular in Spain, our concerns primarily relate to
the smaller CAJA savings banks, which account for 20 percent of
the system, but the core of the banking system does remain
strong in our view,"" he said.
 Coulton said even though Spain had been adversely affected
by the Greek contagion, its fiscal policy credibility was
strong and adjustment measures on the table were concrete and
sizeable and a big contrast to Greece, especially before the
IMF program.
 On China, he repeated his comments from Tuesday that
Bejing's move to unshackle the yuan at the weekend would not
have direct consequences for its A-plus long-term rating, but
was supportive.
 ""To the extent that allowing greater exchange rate
appreciation helps rebalancing domestic demand from investment
to consumption, that would help,"" he said.
 ""In addition, we do think there are inflation pressures and
allowing the exchange rate to appreciate would again help
mitigate that.""

 * G8 still providing leadership on health, poverty
 (Repeats with no changes to text)
 By Alister Bull
 WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - The Group of Eight is
losing relevance as faster-growing rivals like China and Brazil
play a larger role managing the global economy, but it will
still endure as a key forum for traditional industrial powers.
 Meeting in Huntsville, Canada on June 24-25, the G8 might
look like a warm-up act for the main event in Toronto, where
the G20 gathers for the weekend, but that's not how the host
sees it.
 ""As Prime Minister I go to a lot of summits. The G8
discussions are probably some of the best, most useful,
informative talks that I'm involved in any single year,""
Canadian leader Stephen Harper told Reuters in an interview.
 The G20 supplanted the G8 as the group that manages the
world economy during the global credit crisis, when then U.S.
President George W. Bush summoned its leaders to Washington to
forge a common response that helped to calm financial markets.
 But the G8 still provides a place where its members can, in
theory at least, thrash out their differences in advance and
muster around a common front at the G20.
 ""I think the G8 will continue to meet. I doubt they will
have much significance in the future but it will primarily be a
caucus of the rich countries en route to the G20,"" said Fred
Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International
Economics, a Washington-based think tank.
 The rise of China to become the world's third-biggest
economy and the fast growth of other developing heavyweights
such as Brazil has meant older powers can no longer sit on
their own at the high table of global policy-making.
 Emerging economies served as a vital engine for the world
economy during the recession caused by the credit crisis and,
in return, earned them more clout at institutions such as the
World Bank, as well as the G20.
 The G20 leaders summit was a necessary modernization. The
G8 -- which groups the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia -- had no means to formally
incorporate China, India, Brazil and other successful emerging
economies to discuss key issues like currency misalignment.
 Canada and other smaller economies in the G8 like Italy
have most to lose in the bigger group, as they are overshadowed
by large emerging economies in the G20.
 OLD WORLD TIES
 Bush's successor Barack Obama says he will continue to use
the G20 as the best place to tackle big economic challenges.
 But that does not mean his administration has no use for
either the G8 or the regular Group of Seven meetings of central
bank chiefs and finance ministers of all G8 countries except
Russia.
 Because of its size, the G20 is a harder body to manage
than the G7/G8. More important, the interests of its members
are not nearly as closely aligned as the trans-Atlantic bonds
binding the United States and post-war Western Europe.
 ""The G8 is a much more informal setting of like-minded
friends and allies who discuss and exchange views on a range of
issues, not necessarily to take a decision today, but to shape
attitudes and actions going forward,"" Harper said.
 Washington has a similar attitude to the benefits of a
smaller, more manageable discussion forum.
 ""There is a feeling, including in some parts of the U.S.
government, that the G8, though much diminished, is still
useful as a way to talk with the key allies,"" said Bergsten.
 A senior U.S. administration official told reporters the G8
gave Obama an important forum for tackling issues of mutual
concern with allies, and said it had been particularly useful
during the recent European sovereign debt crisis.
 The G8 also continues to provide a forum for key leaders to
discuss noneconomic issues, ranging from security matters to
health and poverty reduction, where the G20 has yet to show it
has the appetite for leadership.
 ""The G8 isn't withering quite yet. It still has a robust
role in security, development assistance, in addition to
consolidating the economic part of the agenda,"" said Heather
Conley, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think-tank.
 The G8 has led on debt relief for poor countries, most
notably at its 2005 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland, and has
also played an important role in promoting global health
initiatives to tackle HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
 But some critics say it is a needless cost of time and
money, and note that Canada has been forced to defend the C$930
million price-tag for hosting the combined G8/G20 summit.
 ""The G8 had its day when it was about moving Russia closer
to the West, but that time has past,"" said Simon Johnson, a
former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund who
believes the G8 has been ""a waste of time for a long while
now.""
 Formerly communist Russia was invited to join the club in
1997 to form the G8.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2010 12:10AM ET</span>","WRAPUP 3-China punctures yuan hopes, only plodding gains seen"," * Market abandons hopes for rapid yuan appreciation
 * Part of overall normalisation of monetary policy
 * Yuan ekes out marginal gain Wednesday
 * C.bank apparently guiding rate via state banks
 By Lu Jianxin and Jason Subler
 SHANGHAI, June 23 (Reuters) - China's yuan eked out a tiny
gain on Wednesday after its biggest swings since 2005 earlier
this week, suggesting Beijing's promise of currency flexibility
will not produce the rapid gains its trading partners would
like.
 Whatever its daily gyrations, analysts suspect the yuan
will be allowed to rise over time but at a pace that is too
slow to narrow China's huge trade surplus with the United
States soon.
 That could prompt U.S. and other officials meeting at a
Group of 20 summit in Canada this weekend to press Beijing
further over what its new currency policy will mean in
practice.
 The United States has officially welcomed China's weekend
announcement signalling it was ditching a two-year peg to the
dollar, but the country's largest federation of labour unions
has already run out of patience, calling for renewed pressure
on Beijing from G20 and the U.S. Congress.
 ""The de-pegging story was overblown,"" said Adam Carr, a
senior economist at broker ICAP in Sydney. ""It lacked
substance, given China was never going to make huge inroads
into revaluation,"" he said.
 ""More importantly, it over-emphasised the value of the
currency in the Chinese/world growth narrative -- an
appreciating yuan is not going to rebalance the world,"" he
added.
 The yuan rose 0.02 percent on Wednesday, the third trading
day after the central bank said it would allow greater
flexibility for the currency but keep appreciation gradual.
 That modest move brought the overall gain since the central
bank's announcement to just 0.2 percent, a contrast to the
market excitement generated on Monday when the currency rose
nearly 0.5 percent for its biggest one-day rise since its
landmark revaluation in 2005.
 That rise gave way to a fall on Tuesday, before Wednesday's
flat trade.
 Significant dollar purchases by state-controlled banks
appeared to be on behalf of the central bank, suggesting the
authority continues to exercise a heavy hand in controlling the
currency's value, traders said.
 YUAN GAINS NOT A SURE THING
 Beijing's decision to free the yuan helped fuel a global
market rally on Monday on hopes that a stronger yuan would
boost spending in the world's third-largest economy and
increase its demand for foreign goods, giving a much-needed
boost to a global recovery.
 That impact has since faded, with Asian stock markets and
commodities-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar
giving up some of their gains.
 ""The last three days have showed that hopes for a one-way
appreciation are wishful thinking. We can tell that they are
quite serious about allowing for two-way fluctuations,"" said
Isaac Meng, an analyst with BNP Paribas in Beijing.
 Meng said the yuan appeared to be genuinely tracking a
basket of other global currencies this time as opposed to the
period from mid-2005 to mid-2008, when the reference to a
basket was more words than practice.
 After two days that saw some of the greatest volatility in
the yuan since the revaluation, it traded in a much narrower
range on Wednesday, keeping the market guessing as to what the
new currency regime would ultimately look like.
 A Reuters poll of 33 economists on Monday forecast the yuan
would rise to 6.67 per dollar by the end the year, an increase
of just 2.4 percent from late last week and similar to the
appreciation implied by offshore non-deliverable forwards.
 LONG RUN STILL POSITIVE
 In the long run, the shift to more two-way movement in the
yuan will give the central another lever for keeping the
world's third-largest economy on track, helping along important
structural adjustments that will see its role as a global
consumer rise and its reliance on exports ease somewhat.
 ""To the extent that allowing greater exchange rate
appreciation helps rebalancing domestic demand from investment
to consumption, that would help,"" Brian Coulton, head of global
economics at Fitch Ratings, said in the Dealing Room, a Reuters
chatroom.
 ""In addition, we do think there are inflation pressures and
allowing the exchange rate to appreciate would again help
mitigate that.""
 Similarly, despite the initial market disappointment now
that the central bank will not allow any steep gains in the
yuan, its reforms will still help to gradually revive a
commodity price rally, said Tim Condon, chief Asia economist
with ING.
 ""We view the restoration of a yuan appreciation trend as
part of the normalisation of monetary policy,"" Condon said in a
research report.
 ""Just as the crisis forced a change in monetary policy
settings, it threw commodity imports off their steady growth
trend. We think the (slow) return of policies to their
pre-crisis settings will be accompanied by the return of trend
growth in commodity imports.""
 Still, following only modest gains in the yuan this week,
some did not take such a positive view of the new regime.
 ""We strongly urge further effort by both the U.S. and other
G20 governments until China takes specific steps on a scale
that addresses the scale of the imbalance,"" said Richard
Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S.
federation of labour unions.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2010 12:02AM ET</span>",US scores dead last again in healthcare study," * US spends twice as much as others, gets less
 * US system less efficient, less equitable
 By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor
 WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - Americans spend twice as
much as residents of other developed countries on healthcare,
but get lower quality, less efficiency and have the least
equitable system, according to a report released on Wednesday.
 The United States ranked last when compared to six other
countries -- Britain, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Australia
and New Zealand, the Commonwealth Fund report found.
 ""As an American it just bothers me that with all of our
know-how, all of our wealth, that we are not assuring that
people who need healthcare can get it,"" Commonwealth Fund
president Karen Davis told reporters in a telephone briefing.
 Previous reports by the nonprofit Fund, which conducts
research into healthcare performance and which promotes changes
in the U.S. system, have been heavily used by policymakers and
politicians pressing for healthcare reform.
 Davis said she hoped health reform legislation passed in
March would lead to improvements.
 The current report uses data from nationally representative
patient and physician surveys in seven countries in 2007, 2008,
and 2009.
 In 2007, health spending was $7,290 per person in the
United States, more than double that of any other country in
the survey.
 Australians spent $3,357, Canadians $3,895, Germans $3,588,
the Netherlands $3,837 and Britons spent $2,992 per capita on
health in 2007. New Zealand spent the least at $2,454.
 And yet Americans get less for their money, said the
Commonwealth Fund's Cathy Schoen.
 ""We rank last on safety and do poorly on several dimensions
of quality,"" Schoen told reporters. ""We do particularly poorly
on going without care because of cost. And we also do
surprisingly poorly on access to primary care and after-hours
care.""
 SIXTH IN QUALITY
 The report looks at five measures of healthcare -- quality,
efficiency, access to care, equity and the ability to lead
long, healthy, productive lives.
 ""On measures of quality the United States ranked 6th out of
seven countries,"" the group said in a statement.
 U.S. patients with chronic conditions were the most likely
to say they got the wrong drug or had to wait to learn of
abnormal test results.
 Overall Britain, whose nationalized healthcare system was
widely derided by opponents of U.S. healthcare reform, ranks
first, the Commonwealth team found.
 ""The findings demonstrate the need to quickly implement
provisions in the new health reform law and stimulus
legislation that focus on strengthening primary care,
realigning incentives to reward higher quality and greater
value, investing in preventive care, and expanding the use of
health information technology,"" the report reads.
 Critics of reports that show Europeans or Australians are
healthier than Americans point to the U.S. lifestyle as a
bigger factor than healthcare. Americans have higher rates of
obesity than other developed countries, for instance.
 ""On the other hand, the other countries have higher rates
of smoking,"" Davis countered. And Germany, for instance, has a
much older population more prone to chronic disease.
 Every other system covers all its citizens, the report
noted and said the U.S. system, which leaves 46 million
Americans or 15 percent of the population without health
insurance, is the most unfair.
""The lower the performance score for equity, the lower the
performance on other measures. This suggests that, when a
country fails to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, it also
fails to meet the needs of the average citizen,"" the report
reads.

 SINGAPORE, June 23 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid on

 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO, June 23 (Reuters) - The dollar and the yen were
broadly steady on Wednesday while the euro and high-yielders were
on the defensive as a recent risk rally appeared to have run its
course and the euphoria from China's new yuan policy waned.
 Trading the dollar based on the short-term direction of the
yuan and its mid-point fixing had become a market fad this week,
in the wake of China's decision to loosen the yuan's 23-month-old
peg to the U.S. dollar.
 But traders said such trading interest was ebbing after the
yuan fell on Tuesday on hefty dollar purchases by state-owned
banks, which suggested the central bank was trying to create
two-way trade and check the yuan's gains.
 Instead, a sharp fall in U.S. stocks and a subsequent drop in
the Nikkei helped support the dollar and the yen, which are
favoured when risk aversion spikes and doubts over the health of
the global economy emerge.
 ""The sense in the market probably is that it is better not to
stop taking short positions in the euro,"" said a trader at a
Japanese bank.
 ""I think the focus is on whether the euro will fall back
below $1.2000, and how far it may fall from there,"" he added.
 The euro is now hovering close to a support area near
$1.2255.
 That level marks a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
euro's recent rally from its four-year low of $1.1876 hit in
early June on trading platform EBS to a one-month high of $1.2490
hit on Monday.
 A clear break below that level could open the way for a drop
towards $1.2145 to $1.2165, an area where the euro hit a number
of intraday lows in mid- to late-May.
 The euro held steady from late U.S. trading on Tuesday at
$1.2270, having dipped to as low as $1.2244 earlier.
 Against the yen, the euro held steady at 111.09 yen after
sliding nearly 1 percent on Tuesday.
 EURO ZONE'S BANKING SECTOR
 An earlier dip in the Australian dollar paused after China
set the yuan's mid-point at 6.8102 per dollar, slightly higher
than Tuesday's close at 6.8136, but the overall impact was
limited.
 The Australian dollar edged up 0.1 percent to $0.8722, having
backed off a one-month high of $0.8860 hit earlier this week.
 One factor tempering appetite for risk currencies and the
euro was a renewed focus on problems in the euro zone and the
global economy.
 Worries about the euro zone's banking sector returned to the
fore after French bank Credit Agricole pushed back profit targets
for its struggling Greek unit Emporiki and said it will take a
400 million euro ($536.7 million) write-down as Greece fights its
debt load.
 A ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas by Fitch and
S&P's announcement on Monday that it had raised estimates for
loan losses for Spain's banking sector were also likely to weigh
on the euro.
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a
basket of currencies, held steady at 86.103, having pulled up
from a one-month low of 85.091 hit on Monday.
 The dollar dipped 0.1 percent against the yen to 90.53 yen.
 The two-day Federal Open Market Committee will take centre
stage later on Wednesday.
 The Fed is expected to restate its intention to keep rates
near zero and perhaps offer a less upbeat outlook. Traders will
keep an eye on what they may say about the impact of Europe on
the U.S economy.

 SYDNEY, June 23 (Reuters) - The dollar and the yen gained
ground on Wednesday while the euro and high-yielders were on the
defensive as a recent risk rally appeared to have run its course
and the euphoria from China's new yuan policy waned.
 Still, traders will be looking to China for cues on
speculation on how much the authorities there would let their

purchases by state-owned banks, suggesting the central bank was
trying to create two-way trade and check its gains.
 All eyes are on the yuan's mid-point fixing at 0115 GMT. The
People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the mid-point on Tuesday at a
surprisingly strong 6.7980 a dollar, but then allowed the yuan to
fall back in spot trade.
 ""We will be keeping an eye on the mid-point fixing of the
yuan, but I think the impact is lessening as people are aware the

 TORONTO, June 22 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar finished
lower against the greenback on Tuesday after the Bank of Canada
said the currency's drag on the Canadian recovery could be a
key issue in future monetary policy.
 Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said the value
of the Canadian currency against the U.S. dollar would affect
the central bank's decision on interest rates on July 20 and
beyond, sending the currency to a session low at C$1.0296 to
the U.S. dollar, or 97.13 U.S. cents. [ID:nTOR007606]
[ID:nN22144820]
 His comments, coupled with earlier data that showed
domestic inflation was not a threat, put a brake on near-term
rate-hike expectations. [ID:nN22110502]
 ""It's casting a bit of doubt as to what the bank is going
to do at the next meeting,"" said John Curran, senior
vice-president at CanadianForex.
 ""But I still think if we continue to get decent numbers out
of Canada they'll hike rates again.""
 Markets have priced in a nearly 80 percent probability that
the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates at its next policy
setting announcement in July -- slightly lower than in the
previous session. The bank raised its key rate this month by a
quarter-point to 0.5 percent. 
 The Canadian dollar finished near its session low at
C$1.0291 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.17 U.S. cents, down from
Monday's close at C$1.0244 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.62 U.S.
cents.
 The currency's weakness was exacerbated by the rapidly
declining price of oil and equity markets, which fell in part
because of a surprise drop in U.S. existing home sales in May
as well as a ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas.
[ID:nN22382886] [MKTS/GLOB]
 BONDS GAIN
 Canadian government bond prices shot higher on a rethink of
the path of interest rates, while riskier assets such as
equities were also falling out of favor.
 A slower pace of gasoline price increases helped the annual
inflation rate ease to 1.4 percent in May from 1.8 percent in
April, Statistics Canada said.
 The core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile items
like gasoline and is the Bank of Canada's most trusted gauge of
underlying price trends, came in at 1.8 percent versus 1.9
percent in the previous month. This was just above the 1.7
percent forecast for May.
 ""There probably is a little bit of inflation calm that is
contributing to this, but the real story is one in which global
bonds are rallying quite aggressively,"" said Eric Lascelles,
chief Canada macro strategist at TD Securities.
 ""You could make the case that the risk-off trade is
starting to dominate again and that's helping this bond rally
quite nicely.""
 Domestic bonds tracked U.S. Treasuries, which rose in price
as weak housing data and shaky stocks underscored the fragile
state of the economic recovery. [US/]
 The two-year government bond  jumped 10 Canadian
cents to yield 1.689 percent, while the 10-year bond
 rose 63 Canadian cents to yield 3.253 percent.
 Canadian bonds were mixed against U.S. Treasury issues,
with short-term bonds outperforming and long-dated issues
underperforming. The Canadian 10-year bond yield was 9.4 basis
points above its U.S. counterpart, compared with 8 basis points
on Monday.

 NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and yen rose
on Tuesday as investors, nervous about a fall in U.S. stocks
late in the day, sought a safe haven in U.S. and Japanese
bonds.
 After recovering in the past week, U.S. stocks were led
lower by energy and housing sector stocks, spurring a sell-off
in currencies that have become proxies for risk appetite such
as the euro, the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand
dollars.
 ""There has been a rapid change in sentiment in the currency
and equity markets, although the moves in forex don't have that
much conviction,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency
strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.
 ""The euro, Aussie, and other risk currencies are just
moving in lock step with the equity market even though currency
traders are not really focused on the issues driving stocks.""
 In late trading, the euro slipped 0.2 percent against the
dollar to $1.2276 and dropped 0.9 percent to 110.98 yen
, while the U.S. dollar was down 0.7 percent versus
the yen to 90.39 .
 The Australian dollar  turned lower to trade 0.4
percent weaker versus the U.S. dollar at US$0.8725. The
Canadian dollar also fell, pushing the greenback 0.4 percent
higher at C$1.0284 .
 With risk currencies falling, analysts said the euphoria
fueled by China's pledge of a flexible yuan over the weekend
has clearly faded.
 After sharp gains on Monday, the Chinese yuan declined
against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday as state-owned banks bought
the greenback, which indicated the People's Bank of China was
using new strategies to fuel two-way trades and limit the Asian
currency's gains. See [ID:nTOE65L07G].
 MARKET EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH
 ""The market is expecting far too much, far too quickly
(from China's announcement) and therefore we saw a big forex
move as a result of these expectations,"" said John McCarthy,
director of foreign exchange at ING Capital in New York.
 ""The markets were a bit disappointed in the aftermath.""
 China said on Monday it will allow the yuan to appreciate
gradually, ruling out a one-off revaluation. Analysts said a
modest yuan appreciation would do little to significantly
reduce China's huge trade imbalance with the United States.
 Some investors also saw less of a boost to the world
economy from China's yuan move than previously expected.
 Traders also said euro zone bank woes returned to the fore
after French bank Credit Agricole  pushed back profit
targets for its struggling Greek unit Emporiki  on
Tuesday and said it will take a 400 million euro ($536.7
million) write-down as Greece fights its debt load.

but analysts said near-term support was seen at $1.2253, a 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement of the rise from a four-year low
around $1.1875 on June 7 to Monday's high.

 By Paul Taylor and Gernot Heller
 PARIS/BERLIN, June 22 (Reuters) - Germany, France and
Britain announced plans on Tuesday to introduce a bank levy to
help meet the costs of the financial crisis, without waiting
for a G20 summit this week, underscoring a rift with key
partners.
 A joint statement said the three biggest European economies
were ""committed to the full implementation of the ambitious G20
financial sector reform agenda,"" but the timing of the tax move
suggested the Europeans have low hopes of any global deal.
 G20 finance ministers dropped the idea of a common levy
this month due to Canadian and Japanese resistance. But
European Union leaders, under pressure to justify austerity
measures to their voters, renewed a call for international
action last week.
 In the United States, lawmakers raced to finalize a
wide-ranging rewrite of financial regulations for President
Barack Obama to tout as a model for other countries at the G20
meeting. The overhaul does not include a bank levy, but
Congress could act on the idea later this year.[ID:nN22574881]
 Britain's new centre-right government included a bank tax
in Tuesday's austere emergency budget, aimed at slashing a
giant deficit and swollen public debt built up rescuing
teetering banks and fighting the deepest recession since World
War Two.
 Finance minister George Osborne announced a two-year public
sector pay freeze, a big increase in value-added tax on goods
and services, a 25 percent cut in most ministries' spending
over four years and measures to curb welfare
costs.[ID:nLDE65L1M6]
 The planned spending cuts were the toughest in a
generation, prompting economist Howard Archer of IHS Global
Insight to call it ""a pretty eye-watering package.""
[ID:nLDE65L19M]
 On the other side of the globe, Japan announced ambitious
targets to rein in its debt, with new Prime Minister Naoto Kan
making clear the government would have to push through
contentious tax increases to fill deep fiscal gaps.
 Kan said the example of Greece, whose debt crisis has
undermined confidence in the euro zone and forced other
European states to adopt austerity measures, showed how markets
had become more wary of public debt and sovereign risk.
[ID:nTOE65L01H]
 Germany said it would put a bank tax bill to the cabinet in
summer and France said it would present details of its bank
levy in the 2011 budget, due to go to parliament in the
autumn.
 Canada, the G20's host, appeared to soften its stance on
the bank levy on Tuesday. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in
a newspaper interview: ""I really want to see the G20 agree on
how to go forward. It is important that we try to be
collegial.""
 GERMAN VICTORY?
 German officials claimed victory even before leaders of the
world's main industrialised and emerging powers meet in
Toronto, saying the G20 was not demanding new stimulus measures
and Berlin did not face censure for its planned austerity
drive. [ID:nLDE65L0NP]
 The United States has repeatedly urged ""surplus countries""
-- code for China and Germany -- to do more to boost domestic
demand.
 The issue of how to rebalance the global economy and
restore post-crisis fiscal discipline without plunging the
world into a double-dip slowdown will feature high on the G20
agenda.
 ""We can expect more sharp disagreements between the U.S.
and Europe, papered over with the common call for 'measures
aimed at ensuring fiscal sustainability in a growth-enhancing
way',"" said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit
bank.
 Beijing moved to defuse Washington's wrath on Saturday by
announcing cautious moves to make its currency more flexible.
But China is still unlikely to let the yuan appreciate nearly
as fast as major trading partners would like.
 World stocks fell for the first time in two weeks on
Tuesday on a cooler assessment of the Chinese decision.
[ID:nLDE65L0CZ]
 As if to underline the limits of the move, Beijing
engineered a slight fall in the yuan exchange rate on Tuesday
after allowing it to rise against the dollar at first.
 Germany, Europe's largest economy, has defended plans to
save around 80 billion euros over the next four years after
U.S. President Barack Obama preached patience in clamping down
on public spending.
 German officials said Obama did not press Chancellor Angela
Merkel to ramp up stimulus spending in a recent telephone
call.
 ""The exit from economic stimulus measures in 2011 is
recognised as correct,"" one official said.
 Merkel says Berlin has to pursue deficit reduction both
because of a constitutional obligation and because it has
Europe's fastest-ageing population. It also wants to set an
example to the rest of the euro zone after Greece's debt
crisis.
 U.S. and European officials say the global leadership
forum, which began meeting at top level in late 2008 to bring
rising powers such as China, India and Brazil into joint
stewardship of the world economy, is proving unwieldy to
manage.
 The G20 has increasingly taken precedence over the Group of
Eight industrialised powers as the main forum for international
economic policy debate, but decisions are harder to take
because of the larger membership.
 ""The question of the banking charge, for example, is going
to be a test point from which it'll become clear whether the
G20 is in a position to formulate interests jointly or whether
it splits apart in two camps,"" one German official said.
 However, on the bank levy issue, the main opposition comes
from longstanding members of the G8, not the newcomers.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2010 03:46PM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Yuan move alone won't alter U.S., European growth"," By Emily Kaiser and Brian Love
 WASHINGTON/PARIS, June 22 (Reuters) - China's looser grip
on its currency won't alter sluggish U.S. or European growth
prospects unless Beijing is prepared to assume the mantle of
the world's consumer of last resort.
 In the short run, a stronger yuan would help neutralize a
small but worrisome deflation threat in advanced economies, and
boost prospects for U.S. exporters hurt by a weak euro.
 If Saturday's surprise announcement of greater yuan
flexibility is to pay long-term dividends, however, China will
need to back it up with structural shifts that encourage its
consumers to spend more and save less.
 Judging from China's words and actions in the past 48
hours, the yuan policy shift appears to be more about Beijing
protecting its exports to Europe rather than bowing to U.S.
pressure for a stronger currency to reduce trade imbalances.
 ""By far the most important motivation is China's concerns
regarding the euro crisis,"" said Donald Straszheim, head of
China research at Los Angeles-based ISI Group.
 The yuan had risen 15 percent against the euro in the last
two months as European debt worries sent investors flocking to
the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar, threatening China's
exports to its largest trading partner.
 By linking the yuan to a basket of currencies rather than
just the dollar, China can better respond to euro swings. But
that also means the dollar-yuan exchange rate is likely to be
""more ragged and jagged"" in the future, Straszheim said.
 ""This is going to drive Washington nuts,"" he said.
 The yuan's gyrations so far this week illustrate that.
Beijing allowed the yuan to rise sharply on Monday but then
fall on Tuesday, a bid to discourage investors looking to
profit on a one-way currency appreciation bet.
 JUST KEEP GROWING, PLEASE
 Lost in the excitement of the yuan's unshackling is that
Beijing thinks its economy is strong enough to withstand it.
That may be more meaningful for the United States and Europe
than any modest movements in China's currency.
 In its announcement of the more flexible currency policy,
the People's Bank of China said the country's economic recovery
""has become more solid."" First-quarter economic growth clocked
in at an explosive 11.9 percent.
 The United States and Europe are both facing sluggish
growth as their own consumers -- and governments -- dig out of
debt. Both regions are looking to exports to pick up the slack.
Both need China's relatively untapped consumers.
 ""We need to find a (new) consumer of last resort,"" said
Gilles Moec, senior European economist at Deutsche Bank in
London. ""China's a good candidate.""
 A gradually strengthening yuan increases the purchasing
power of Chinese consumers.
 Euro zone exports to China rose 334 percent in the decade
from 1999 to 2009, according to statistics published by the
European Union's statistics office, Eurostat. Euro zone exports
to the United States, although still much bigger in absolute
terms, rose just 11 percent.
 It is a similar story in the United States. While the
United States exports three times as much to the European Union
as it does to China, its Chinese exports jumped 431 percent
from 1999 to 2009, while EU exports rose just 43 percent.
 SMALL DOSE OF INFLATION
 Back in 2005, the last time China eased its grip on the
yuan, the worry was this would trigger a rise in inflation
among advanced economies that had benefited from cheaper
Chinese goods, and a drop in demand for U.S. government debt
because Beijing's purchases would fall.
 Neither prediction proved accurate.
 Between July 2005, when China began its revaluation, until
July 2008 when it was halted, China's holdings of U.S. Treasury
debt rose to $550 billion from $300 billion, according to David
Rosenberg, chief economist at money management firm Gluskin
Sheff in Toronto.
 China's Treasury holdings stood at $900 billion as of
April, according to the latest Treasury Department report on
international capital, released last week.
 Core U.S. inflation, which excludes food and energy, fell
to 0.9 percent year-over-year in May, the lowest since 1961,
compared with 2.1 percent back in 2005.
 With U.S. unemployment near 10 percent and the housing
market weak, deflation poses a modest but not insignificant
threat, so a little import price pressure coming from China
would not be such a bad thing right now.
 ""The world is awash with $222.5 trillion of total
liabilities across public and private sector claims, or the
equivalent of 362 percent of global GDP,"" Rosenberg said.
""Extinguishing this debt will be deflationary.""
 REBALANCING? MAYBE NOT
 Those hoping China's embrace of currency flexibility is the
first step along the path to reducing its emphasis on exports
may be disappointed.
 China and the rest of the Group of 20 nations signed on to
a U.S.-backed framework for balanced economic growth in
September, but so far there is little evidence of policy
adjustments that would curb China's reliance on exports.
 The weekend's currency announcements were not accompanied
by any structural moves that would encourage domestic demand,
such as enhancing the social safety net so that households
would be less inclined to save.
 To be sure, Beijing would never have endorsed the currency
shift if authorities thought domestic demand was set to fall,
Deutsche Bank's Moec pointed out, and giving its 1.3 billion
citizens greater buying power will no doubt boost consumption.
 But Straszheim, the China researcher from ISI, said he had
misgivings about Beijing's commitment to global rebalancing.
 ""To China, the best way to assure a robust consumer sector
is to have an economy that is generating jobs, and that is
still heavily (dependent) on the trade side,"" he said.
 ""It's sort of like the old saying in America: The best
welfare program is a good job.""

(Changes dateline, adds quotes, details)
 By Rod Nickel
 WINNIPEG, June 22 (Reuters) - China's move to let its
currency appreciate will help reduce global imbalances and take
some pressure off the Canadian dollar, and ultimately benefit
the Canadian economy, a Bank of Canada official said on
Tuesday.
 The Chinese currency's peg to the U.S. dollar had ""put more
of the burden of adjustment on other currencies, including
ours,"" Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said
following a speech in Winnipeg.
 ""We would see ... policies for more balanced global growth
and the rotation of demand as being something that would take
some pressure off the Canadian dollar and basically be
beneficial to the Canadian economy.""
 Lane said the value of the Canadian currency against the
U.S. dollar would affect the central bank's decision on
interest rates on July 20 and beyond.
 ""Clearly that is, as I mentioned earlier, a factor that, at
current levels it has been dampening the recovery in Canada,
and certainly that would be one of the factors that we take
into consideration in deciding, in assessing the outlook for
the Canadian economy in the future, and would therefore be a
factor in our decisions on monetary policy.""
 The the Canadian dollar was at C$1.0223 to the U.S. dollar,
or 97.82 U.S. cents early Tuesday morning.
 Lane also repeated the bank's mantra that any further
interest rate hikes are difficult to predict due to
uncertainties in the global economy, particularly regarding
European debt woes.
 ""Because of the uncertainties -- particularly those
emanating from Europe -- we've been careful to emphasize that
the extent and timing of any additional withdrawal of monetary
stimulus would depend on how the outlook for economic activity
and inflation evolves,"" Lane said in the prepared text of a
speech he was giving in Winnipeg.
 The Canadian economy has grown at robust rates for two
quarters but the clip is expected to moderate in the second
quarter, Lane said.
 In a report on Monday, the bank said most of the risks to
the Canadian financial system come from beyond the country's
borders. In his speech, Lane focused on two main risks: global
imbalances and sovereign debt.
 To rebalance global growth, countries that are running
current account surpluses need to increase domestic spending,
while deficit countries need to decrease theirs, he said.
 ""In this regard, China's recent decision to enhance the
flexibility of its exchange rate is an important step forward;
its full implementation will contribute to strong, sustainable,
and balanced global economic growth,"" he said.
 The consequence of countries not making the right policy
changes could be another crisis, he said. To ensure leading
economies are on the right track they should submit to mutual
assessment by their G20 peers in a process that he said was
still being worked out.
 ""Each member country will submit its policies to the G20
for assessment by other members, with a view to promoting
coherence among macroeconomic policies,"" he said.
 On the issue of sovereign debt, Lane urged countries to
commit to austerity now and not postpone painful decisions,
saying ""promises of future action are rarely enough to convince
markets.""

 By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
 NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and euro fell
against the yen on Tuesday as investors turned risk-averse amid
persistent doubts about China's move to make the yuan flexible
and renewed worries about European banks' funding needs.
 The Chinese yuan declined against the dollar given heavy
buying of the greenback by state-owned banks, which indicated
the People's Bank of China was using new strategies to fuel
two-way trades and limit the Asian currency's gains.
 ""Dollar/yen is still reeling from the whole China story. I
think the market hasn't figured out yet how much China will let
the yuan appreciate,"" said Steven Butler, director of FX
trading at Scotia Capital in New York.
 China said on Monday it will allow the yuan to appreciate
gradually, ruling out a one-off revaluation. Analysts said a
modest yuan appreciation would do little to significantly
reduce China's huge trade imbalance with the United States.
 Some investors saw less of a boost to the world economy
from China's yuan move than previously expected.
 ""Overall, I think there is still some risk aversion in the
market, which has caused a bit of yen buying.""
 In early afternoon trading, the dollar was down 0.5 percent
versus the yen to 90.59, while the euro dropped 0.5 percent as
well at 111.42 yen but was little changed against the dollar at
$1.2303.
 The single euro zone currency recovered from the day's lows
as U.S. equities recouped some of their losses, prompting
short-covering in the euro and pushing it above $1.23.
 The 25-day rolling correlation between euro/dollar and the
S&P 500 remained at a solid 59 percent on Tuesday, making the
currency one of the proxies for risk appetite.
 Overall, traders said there were more euro sellers than
buyers as euro zone bank woes returned to the fore after French
bank Credit Agricole pushed back profit targets for its
struggling Greek unit Emporiki on Tuesday and said it will take
a 400 million euro ($536.7 million) write-down as Greece fights
its debt load.
 A ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas by Fitch and
S&P's announcement on Monday that it had raised estimates for
loan losses for Spain's banking sector continued to weigh on
the euro and, analysts said.
 ""The Credit Agricole, BNP news has all brought back into
the limelight the likelihood of structural problems in the euro
zone,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange Inc in Washington, D.C.
 Market participants said the euro would face more losses,
but technical analysts said near-term support was seen at
$1.2253, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rise from
a four-year low around $1.1875 on June 7 to Monday's high.
 In other currencies, the Swiss franc extended gains to an
all-time high against the euro after the Swiss central bank's
vice chairman said the bank would not intervene in markets for
now..
 The euro fell to a low of 1.3588 francs on the EBS
platform, with options barriers at both 1.3650 and 1.3600
giving way.
 Sterling, meanwhile, fell to a session low against the
dollar but then recovered to trade 0.7 percent higher on the
day at $1.4840, as investors reacted positively to UK Finance
Minister George Osborne's first budget..
 ""Clearly, one of the main drivers is the pound. Once the
pound took off, that pushed euro/sterling lower, although that
was not enough to pressure euro/dollar as the latter is moving
in tandem with equities,"" said Scotia's Butler.
 ""Gains in the pound were mostly positioning. Markets were
looking for stops above $1.4680 that helped cable a lot.""

 * VAT rise likely to keep CPI above target for another year
 * Inflation pressure limits chance of more QE
 
 By David Milliken
 LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery
could grind to a halt early next year when it bears the brunt of
hefty tax rises and unspecified spending cuts set out earlier on
Tuesday in finance minister George Osborne's first Budget.
 Moreover the Bank of England will face a dilemma as higher
value-added tax looks set to cause inflation to spend another
year above target at a time when extreme fiscal pressure might
otherwise argue for more quantitative easing.
 Nonetheless, most economists think Britain's new coalition
of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had little option but to
deliver the toughest Budget in a generation to tackle Britain's
worst-ever peacetime budget deficit.
 ""They didn't have the luxury of not taking action, and on
balance the scale of deficit reduction is marginally less than
what we expected,"" said Ross Walker, economist at Royal Bank of
Scotland.
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's put Britain's triple-A
government debt rating on negative watch a year ago due to the
fiscal hit from Britain's deepest recession since World War Two,
and Osborne has made stopping a downgrade a key policy goal.
 But political will alone is not enough for the coalition to
balance Britain's budget before the next election in 2015.
 However much effort Osborne puts into driving down
government spending, the exports that will be needed to fuel
growth and tax revenue hinge on buoyant demand from Britain's
equally stricken European trading partners -- a sharp contrast
to when Canada and Sweden cut huge deficits in the 1990s.
 ""Can you have coordinated cuts in public spending across the
world and not go back into a period of very slow growth or even
recession,"" asked Peter Hemington, partner at accountants BDO.
 The answer according to Britain's newly created Office for
Budget Responsibility is yes. In forecasts after the Budget, it
predicted that the economy would grow by 2.3 percent next year
and by around 2.8 percent a year for the four years after that
-- only fractionally less than it forecast before the Budget.
 Given that over the period the coalition plans to raise
taxes and cut spending by a combined 135 billion pounds to all
but erase a budget deficit of 11 percent of GDP, this modest
impact on growth looks far too optimistic, argues BNP Paribas
economist Alan Clarke.
 Assuming every pound less of government spending reduced GDP
by a pound in the short-run, that would imply growth of just 1
percent in 2011 -- with quarterly growth close to zero in the
first six months of the year, Clarke said.
 ""This is supposed to be the most aggressive fiscal
tightening in a generation and (the OBR) merely knocks 0.1
percentage points off growth in a single quarter,"" said Clarke.
 ""Needless to say we suspect the government's growth
projections will be disappointed.""
 Other economists are more optimistic. Walker sees downside
risks from weak export demand, but otherwise thinks the new OBR
estimates are in the right ballpark, and the National Institute
of Economic and Social Research takes a similar view.
 
 BOE DILEMMA
 The BoE will also face a dilemma, as the budget will
exacerbate inflation in the short term while putting pressure on
growth in the medium term. Interest rates are already at a
record low of 0.5 percent, and it suspended is quantitative
easing policy of buying government bonds in February.
 Inflation has been above the BoE's 2 percent target since
the start of the year due to a rise in VAT on Jan. 1, and
economists expect another year of above-target inflation is on
the cards due to the increase in VAT sales tax to 20 percent
pencilled in for Jan. 4, 2011.
 In theory the BoE, with its medium-term view of growth in
inflation, should look past these one-off upward shocks to
inflation and focus instead on longer-term growth weakness.
 ""On a bald reading ... the case could be made for further
policy loosening, ie more QE,"" said Simon Hayes, economist at
Barclays Capital.
 ""However, taking the VAT increase into account we think it
highly unlikely that QE would be extended ... as this would be
likely to have an adverse impact on monetary credibility and
inflation expectations,"" Hayes continued.
 But Clarke was less sure, saying the fiscal tightening due
for 2011/12 and 2012/13 would push the central bank's inflation
forecast down to 1 percent or lower at the two-year horizon that
is key for BoE policy decisions.
 ""If this is not enough to trigger additional unconventional
monetary policy easing, we don't know what is,"" he said.

fiscal consolidation will not undermine economic recovery
because they will boost investor confidence, Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday.
 Some policymakers and research institutes have expressed
concern that the austerity measures being launched by European
governments to head off a spread of the debt crisis begun in
Greece will hamper economic growth.
 U.S. President Barack Obama said last week public finance

fiscal sustainability have been biggest, and slower elsewhere,""

 NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - Weak May U.S. housing data
undercut stocks and sent U.S. Treasuries up, while Europe
grappled with a fresh tremor to its banking system after Fitch
downgraded French bank BNP Paribas.
 The downgrade hit Europe's banking stocks, leading to the
end of a nine-day rally, and pushed prices for gold higher on
safe-haven flows.
 The rally fueled by China's weekend announcement to
emphasize a flexible currency rather than the de facto peg to
the U.S. dollar appeared to have fully dissipated as investors
acknowledge this would not lead to a sharp appreciation of the
yuan.
 U.S. crude oil futures were little changed at midday,
trading just below $78 a barrel after edging lower in choppy
trading, curbed by a stronger greenback and lowered
expectations about a demand boost in China brought by its move
toward currency flexibility.
 Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 2.2 percent
month over month in May, well below expectations for a rise of
5.5 percent. Analysts said the data bodes ill for the months
ahead, now that a key federal tax credit for home buyers has
expired.
 ""It was generally expected that sales would be up, given
earlier contract signings because of the tax credit, so it is
a little surprising,"" said Paul Kasriel, senior vice president
at Northern Trust in Chicago.
 ""It's going to be a two-step forward, one-step backward

 Funding concerns of European banks led to a second day of
losses for the euro against the greenback. The euro came off
its lows, but still lost 0.10 percent to $1.2294 .
 The euro barely reacted to the German Ifo business climate

 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 22 (Reuters) - The United States rejected on
Tuesday a call by Indonesia for a World Trade Organization panel
to rule on their dispute over the U.S. ban on clove-flavoured
cigarettes.
 Like many trade disputes, this turns on health and safety
rules, and whether they are being abused to keep out imports.
 Indonesia says a U.S. law, implemented in September last
year, banning flavoured cigarettes is discriminatory because it
covers the clove flavours popular in the Southeast Asian country
but excludes menthol cigarettes widely produced in America.
 ""No one, least of all Indonesia, questions the serious
health risks associated with the use of tobacco products,""
Indonesian diplomat Nurlaila Nur Muhammad said.
 ""At the same time, we are at a loss to understand the
rationale and justification for the complete ban on clove
cigarettes... while menthol cigarettes are excluded from the
ban,"" she told the WTO's dispute settlement body.
 The U.S. authorities say that flavoured tobacco makes
cigarettes more attractive to young people.
 The World Health Organisation opposes flavoured tobaccos for
that reason. But an official at the WHO's Tobacco-Free
Initiative told Reuters that more research needed to be done
into menthol, which appeared to be marketed mainly to women.
 ""Any additive that changes the flavour is usually done to
convey a sense of less danger and whether marketed or not it
alters the property of the cigarette in a way that may make them
look less harmful -- and that we oppose,"" Armando Peruga said.
 
 NO DISCRIMINATION, U.S. SAYS
 A U.S. official said the ban did not discriminate against
any country and Indonesia's request for a panel to rule on the
dispute was premature as a scientific committee set up under the
law to examine tobacco products would report by March next year.
 Under WTO rules, the defendant in a dispute is allowed to
block the creation of a panel at the first request, but cannot
obstruct it a second time. Indonesia's request is likely to go
through at the next meeting on July 20.
 Clove-flavoured cigarettes, known as kretek, dominate
cigarette consumption in Indonesia, the world's fifth biggest
tobacco market, but only small numbers are exported, and the
unflavoured sort, or ""white sticks"", are gaining in popularity.
 U.S. government surveys showed that menthol cigarettes
accounted for 44 percent of cigarettes consumed by young people
and 28 percent of all consumption, Muhammad said.
 Clove cigarettes accounted for less than 0.05 percent of
cigarettes smoked by young people, and 0.09 percent of all
consumption, before the ban, she said.
 The United States imported $15.2 million worth of kretek
cigarettes in 2008, of which 99 percent came from Indonesia,
according to U.S. data cited by Indonesian officials. Since the
ban, sales have fallen to zero.
 ""In many parts of my country the main source of income and
employment is the production of tobacco, clove and cigarettes,""
Muhammad said.
 ""Indeed, well over 6 million Indonesians depend directly or
indirectly on clove cigarette production to put food on the
table, clothes on their children's backs and day's wages in
their pocket.""
 Foreign tobacco producers, keen to gain a bigger share of
the expanding markets for cigarettes in emerging economies, have
been buying up Indonesian manufacturers to acquire kretek brands
and build on the potential for white stick sales.
 In June last year, the world's no. 2 cigarette maker,
British American Tobacco, bought an 85 percent stake in
Indonesia's fourth largest cigarette maker by volume, PT Bentoel
Internasional Investama.
 Philip Morris International acquired the majority of Hanjaya
Mandala Sampoerna in 2005. Other Indonesian manufacturers
include Gudang Garam and unlisted conglomerate Djarum.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - Weak May U.S. housing data
undercut stocks and sent U.S. Treasuries up, while Europe
grappled with a fresh tremor to its banking system after Fitch
downgraded French bank BNP Paribas .
 The downgrade hit Europe's banking stocks, leading to the
end of a nine-day rally and pushed prices for gold higher on
safe-haven flows.
 The rally fueled by China's weekend announcement to
emphasize a flexible currency rather than the de facto peg to
the U.S. dollar appeared to have fully dissipated.
 U.S. crude oil futures edged lower in choppy trading,
curbed by a stronger greenback and lowered expectations about a
demand boost in China brought by its move toward currency
flexibility.
 Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 2.2 percent month
over month in May, well below expectations for a rise of 5.5
percent. Analysts said the data bodes ill for the months ahead,
now that a key homeowner tax credit has expired.
 ""Clearly there's a large supply of homes on the market.
Prices are a little firmer than they were a year ago, but it's
still a buyers market. The tax incentives are not a permanent
fix for housing. We will need to see improved employment before
we see a sustained recovery in housing."" said Gary Thayer,
chief strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.
 In mid-morning New York trade, the Dow Jones industrial
average <.DJI> fell 7.56 points, or 0.07 percent, at 10,434.85.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> lost 2.36 points, or

 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.5

benchmark has gained more than 7 percent since then.
 European share, however, lost ground with the FTSEurofirst
300 <.FTEU3> of leading shares down 0.4 percent to 1,050.70.
 After Fitch's move on BNP Paribas sent its shares down 2.75
percent, the entire sector weakened, with the STOXX Europe 600
banks index <.SX7P> off 1.9 percent.
 ""Now everybody thinks that BNP is one of the most solid
banks, so the heat is more on SocGen and Credit Agricole, and
the latter gave a grim update on its exposure to Greece today,""

day after bouncing to a one-month high.
 CURRENCY MOVE
 Investors reassessed the impact of China's plan for more
currency flexibility and grew skeptical about how much Beijing
would allow the yuan to rise.
 ""People gave much more weight to the currency move than it
deserved,"" said Koen De Leus, economist at KBC Securities.
 The funding concerns in European banks led to a second day
of losses for the euro against the U.S. dollar. The currency
dropped 0.31 percent to $1.2268 .

 NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The dollar rallied for a
second straight day against the euro on Tuesday as new concerns
about the funding needs of European banks offset
stronger-than-expected German economic data.
 The yuan declined against the dollar after China's weekend
pledge to allow its currency to trade more freely.
 Monday's upward momentum that helped stoke demand for
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar faded
as investors acknowledged that a more flexible yuan policy
would not lead to a sharp appreciation in the Chinese currency.
 Euro zone bank woes came to the fore after French bank
Credit Agricole  pushed back profit targets for its
struggling Greek unit Emporiki  on Tuesday and said it
will take a 400 million euro ($536.7 million) write-down as
Greece fights its debt load. [ID:nLDE65L0NB]
 A ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas by Fitch and
S&P's announcement on Monday that it had raised estimates for
loan losses for Spain's banking sector continued to weigh on
the euro [ID:nN21250262] and [ID:nLDE65K1TE], analysts said.
 The single currency extended losses after Moody's Investor
Services downgraded two Greek government-sponsored asset-backed
securities.
 ""The Credit Agricole, BNP and Moody's news has all brought
back into the limelight the likelihood of structural problems
in the euro zone,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc in Washington, D.C. ""The
impact from yesterday's China's news has definitely faded.""
 Midway through the New York session, the euro  was
down 0.2 percent at $1.2282, with a session low at $1.2251.
 The single currency touched $1.2490 on electronic trading
platform EBS on Monday, its strongest point since May 24,
though it failed to break into the $1.25 region.
 Market participants said the euro would face more losses,
but technical analysts said near-term support was seen at
$1.2253, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rise from
a four-year low around $1.1875 on June 7 to Monday's high.
 The euro barely reacted to the German Ifo business climate
index, which hit a two-year peak in June, while the
expectations index fell. [ID:nLDE65L0M6]
 ""The positive surprise in the Ifo index failed to change
the market's negative mood. The fact that the expectations
component was downbeat did not help to support the single
currency,"" analysts at Credit Agricole CIB said in a note.
 The Swiss franc extended gains to an all-time high against
the euro after the Swiss central bank's vice chairman said the
bank would not intervene in markets for now. [ID:nLDE65L1LC].
 The euro fell to a low of 1.3590 francs ,
according to Reuters data, with options barriers at both 1.3650
and 1.3600 giving way.
 Against the yen, the euro fell 0.7 percent to 111.23 yen
. The dollar  fell 0.4 percent to 90.61 yen as
the Japanese currency rose across the board.
 CHINA IMPACT FADES
 China's pledge to revalue its currency had less impact on
markets on Tuesday.
 ""It's indicative of the market sentiment out there that the
Chian euphoria lasted all of 18 hours yesterday before we
reverted to risk aversion,"" said Brian Dolan, chief currency
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
 Market rumors of expected currency portfolio adjustment had
little impact on trading. Investors would have to know the size
of components in any official Chinese currency basket for
indications as to how much they should buy and sell those
components as the yuan revalues.
 Trades would also have to be singularly large to drive
exchange rates.
 The yuan's daily mid-point  was set at 6.7980 per
dollar on Tuesday, the highest since its July 2005 revaluation,
but the Chinese currency relinquished further gains as big,
state-owned banks heavily bought dollars. Some traders believe
the buying by state-owned banks was on behalf of the People's
Bank of China to avoid direct market intervention

 By Paul Taylor and Gernot Heller
 PARIS/BERLIN, June 22 (Reuters) - Germany, France and
Britain announced plans on Tuesday to introduce a bank levy to
help meet the costs of the financial crisis, without waiting for
a G20 summit this week, underscoring a rift with key partners.
 A joint statement said the three biggest European economies
were ""committed to the full implementation of the ambitious G20
financial sector reform agenda"", but the timing of the tax move
suggested the Europeans have low hopes of any global deal.
 G20 finance ministers dropped the idea of a common levy this
month due to Canadian and Japanese resistance. But European
Union leaders, under pressure to justify austerity measures to
their voters, renewed a call for international action last week.
 Britain's new centre-right government included a bank tax in
Tuesday's austere emergency budget, aimed at slashing a giant
deficit and swollen public debt built up rescuing teetering
banks and fighting the deepest recession since World War Two.
 Finance minister George Osborne announced a two-year public
sector pay freeze, a big increase in value-added tax on goods
and services, a 25 percent cut in most ministries' spending over
four years and measures to curb welfare costs.
 The planned spending cuts were the toughest in a generation,
prompting economist Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight to call
it ""a pretty eye-watering package"".
 On the other side of the globe, Japan announced ambitious
targets to rein in its debt, with new Prime Minister Naoto Kan
making clear the government would have to push through
contentious tax increases to fill deep fiscal gaps.
 Kan said the example of Greece, whose debt crisis has
undermined confidence in the euro zone and forced other European
states to adopt austerity measures, showed how markets had
become more wary of public debt and sovereign risk.
 Germany said it would put a bank tax bill to the cabinet in
summer and France said it would present details of its bank levy
in the 2011 budget, due to go to parliament in the autumn.
 Canada, the G20's host, appeared to soften its stance on the
bank levy on Tuesday. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in a
newspaper interview: ""I really want to see the G20 agree on how
to go forward. It is important that we try to be collegial.""
 
 GERMAN VICTORY?
 German officials claimed victory even before leaders of the
world's main industrialised and emerging powers meet in Toronto,
saying the G20 was not demanding new stimulus measures and
Berlin did not face censure for its planned austerity drive.
 The United States has repeatedly urged ""surplus countries""
-- code for China and Germany -- to do more to boost domestic
demand.
 The issue of how to rebalance the global economy and restore
post-crisis fiscal discipline without plunging the world into a
double-dip slowdown will feature high on the G20 agenda.
 ""We can expect more sharp disagreements between the U.S. and
Europe, papered over with the common call for 'measures aimed at
ensuring fiscal sustainability in a growth-enhancing way',"" said
Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit bank.
 Beijing moved to defuse Washington's wrath on Saturday by
announcing cautious moves to make its currency more flexible.
But China is still unlikely to let the yuan appreciate nearly as
fast as major trading partners would like.
 World stocks fell for the first time in two weeks on Tuesday
on a cooler assessment of the Chinese decision.
 As if to underline the limits of the move, Beijing
engineered a slight fall in the yuan exchange rate on Tuesday
after allowing it to rise against the dollar at first.
 Germany, Europe's largest economy, has defended plans to
save around 80 billion euros over the next four years after U.S.
President Barack Obama preached patience in clamping down on
public spending.
 German officials said Obama did not press Chancellor Angela
Merkel to ramp up stimulus spending in a recent telephone call.
 ""The exit from economic stimulus measures in 2011 is
recognised as correct,"" one official said.
 Merkel says Berlin has to pursue deficit reduction both
because of a constitutional obligation and because it has
Europe's fastest-ageing population. It also wants to set an
example to the rest of the euro zone after Greece's debt crisis.
 U.S. and European officials say the global leadership forum,
which began meeting at top level in late 2008 to bring rising
powers such as China, India and Brazil into joint stewardship of
the world economy, is proving unwieldy to manage.
 The G20 has increasingly taken precedence over the Group of
Eight industrialised powers as the main forum for international
economic policy debate, but decisions are harder to take because
of the larger membership.
 ""The question of the banking charge, for example, is going
to be a test point from which it'll become clear whether the G20
is in a position to formulate interests jointly or whether it
splits apart in two camps,"" one German official said.
 However, on the bank levy issue, the main opposition comes
from longstanding members of the G8, not the newcomers.

 LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan's sovereign wealth
fund has no plans to reduce euro holdings in its $17 billion
portfolio as it is confident the euro zone will solve its debt
crisis, the country's chief investment officer said on Tuesday.
 Concerns about huge debt in euro zone peripheral countries
and the gloomy economic outlook pushed the euro to a four-year
low around $1.1875 earlier this month -- a 17 percent fall since
January.
 The sharp decline in the single currency has fanned
speculation that foreign exchange reserve managers and sovereign
wealth funds might reconsider their long-term asset allocation
strategy given huge paper losses on their euro holdings.
 The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), which receives
revenues from oil and gas and transit fees, allocates 50 percent
of its assets in U.S. dollars, 40 percent in the euro, 5 percent
in sterling and the rest in other currencies.
 ""There has been huge volatility in the market. But we don't
bet on currency moves. We're not so pessimistic about the future
of the euro,"" Israfil Mammadov told Reuters in London.
 ""There could be problems in terms of the coordination among
euro zone countries but ultimately we think countries of the
euro zone will succeed in overcoming the crisis.""
 SOFAZ's currency allocation, which is rebalanced quarterly,
automatically involves selling dollars on a regular basis given
that its revenues are from dollar-priced energy resources.
 The former Soviet republic's fund has all of its assets in
fixed income, including sovereign, corporate and agency papers.
It is a portfolio investor and only invests abroad.
 It plans to invest in overseas equities to diversify assets
in the future, although Mammadov gave no further details.
 
 FRONTIER FOCUS
 SOFAZ, along with other state funds in Saudi Arabia and
South Korea, invested in April in an $800 million fund managed
by a subsidiary of the World Bank's private-sector lender IFC
that will invest in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.
 It is one of SOFAZ's first major investments outside the
fixed income market and in frontier markets -- potentially
highly profitable but risky investment destinations.
 ""In those (frontier market) countries you have to partner
with those institutions which have strong expertise and
knowledge of the markets, being on the ground and talking to
companies,"" Mammadov said.
 Frontier markets also carry other risks from underdeveloped
regulation, illiquid financial markets and poor corporate
governance records.
 ""Many other investments carry risks as well. As a sovereign
wealth fund, our reputation is of the utmost importance.
Governance issues are paramount to us,"" Mammadov said.
 ""We're owned by people of the country. We're reporting to
people. We're in a public domain in the country. We cannot
afford not to be prudent.""
 Mammadov has said the fund's assets under management are set
to exceed $150 billion by 2030.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2010 10:26AM ET</span>",Sterling rebounds; budget eases fiscal concerns," * Sterling up 0.5 pct versus dlr, reverses initial losses
 * Budget seen tough enough to keep ratings agencies at bay
 * Long-term impact of cuts on growth to hamper rally
 
 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - Sterling gained on Tuesday after
investors concluded the new government's first budget was tough
enough to address the UK's fiscal problems and keep ratings
agencies from downgrading its sovereign debt.
 Analysts, however, said longer-term worries over the impact
of significant fiscal cuts on growth in the UK economy were
likely to hampered sterling rallies.
 UK finance minister George Osborne cut growth and borrowing
forecasts on Tuesday while also raising value-added tax to 20
percent from next year and slapping a levy on banks as part of a
drive to reduce a record peacetime public debt..
 The pound initially extended the day's losses versus the
dollar, shedding around 40 ticks to $1.4688. 
 But gilt futures hit a contract high as the cut in borrowing
outstripped even the most optimistic forecasts and by 1400 GMT,
sterling had reversed its losses to trade up around 0.5 percent
on the day at $1.4819. 
 ""The market has taken the view that the Budget is tough
enough to address the UK's fiscal position and sterling has
rebounded as it should help keep the ratings agencies at bay,""
said Ian Stannard, senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas.
 ""But longer-term there are still concerns about the negative
implications on growth and I think sterling rallies will be
fairly limited from here,"" he added.
 Traders said intra-day stop-losses were hit on the break of
$1.4815, with more lurking in the $1.4830 area.
 The Chancellor said growth this year would be 1.2 percent --
below the 1.3 percent forecast by the Office for Budget
Responsibility last week.
 Growth in 2011 was projected at 2.3 percent, below the OBR's
forecast of 2.6 percent, before picking up to 2.8 percent in
2012 and 2.9 percent in 2013.
 ""The bottom line is that it is now very difficult indeed to
see the ratings agencies downgrading the UK's credit rating.""
Barclays analysts said in a post-budget note to clients.
 
 BEARISH
 The upside potential for sterling after a rally to a
six-week high on Monday was limited by key resistance and
technical traders also said a key-day reversal pattern in
sterling/dollar on Monday made the outlook bearish.
 ""GBP/USD's rally higher has reached and been rejected by
$1.4860/1.4932 resistance (a double Fibonacci level, the 55-day
moving average and the 6-month downtrend). We would allow for a
pullback towards the 20-day moving average at 1.4622."" said
Commerzbank analysts in a note to clients.
 The options market retained a downward bias for sterling in
the wake of the Budget, as the one-month 25-delta risk reversal
sat unchanged at 1.45 in favour of sterling puts. Risk-reversals
are showing a negative bias for sterling from the one-week to
the one-year tenor.
 Data showing futures positioning in sterling last Friday
showed sterling shorts were still favoured, but the number of
short positions had been reduced to 48,134 contracts from 74,680
the previous week.
 Versus the euro, sterling rose to a session high of 82.88
pence, though it remained within the broad range seen over

 LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - The turbulent financial markets
that have characterised the first half of this year have been no
friend to hedge funds, producing what could be called the wrong
kind of volatility -- more like a trampoline than a slide.
 Hedge funds, like others, have also suffered from a
particularly brutal May and an initial failure to see the euro
zone sovereign debt crisis coming.
 Indexes that track the performance of hedge funds show them
at best achieving cash-like returns since January.
 The Credit Suisse/Tremont benchmark, for example, gained
just 1.48 percent by the end of May, while the HFRX Global Hedge
Fund Index was off 0.34 percent by mid-June.
 Given the popular reputation that hedge funds have as
swashbuckling money machines -- not to mention the hefty fees
they charge for that reputation -- these are not the kind of
returns that many investors might have hoped for.
 And this is particularly the case given the volatility of
markets, a backdrop which flexible, aggressive investors should
be better equipped to handle than vanilla funds.
 The problem for hedge fund managers is that 2010,
particularly the month of May, has delivered the type of
volatility where risky assets are one day powering ahead only to
reverse sharply the next, the so-called risk-on, risk-off effect
which can whipsaw investors.
 This has combined with high correlations between assets --
the dollar falling, for example, every time stocks rise -- to
create some of the hardest markets to manoeuvre.
 ""The correlation between investments has been higher than
expected,"" said William De Vijlder, chief investment officer of
BNP Paribas Investment Partners.
 ""You have higher volatility -- which is good -- but higher
correlation. So natural hedges are hard to put in place.""
 
 BUDS OF MAY
 This was the case in May when all but one of the investment
styles tracked by Credit Suisse/Tremont lost most if not all of
what they had gained in the previous four months.
 Its emerging market index, for example, lost 4.28 percent in
May, leaving a year-to-date loss of 0.78 percent. 
 While volatility can throw up opportunities for hedge funds,
they tend to dislike extreme volatility and periods when markets
are not moving on fundamentals.
 The currency carry trade, for example, based on interest
rate differentials, has been more sensitive this year to stock
market movements than economic data and interest rate
expectations.
 Some computer-driven trend-following hedge funds can profit
from a long-term bull or bear market but tend to lose money
during sharp reversals in markets.
 That can be seen in the results for May, when the only hedge
fund investment style listed by Credit Suisse/Tremont that
gained was the one focused on shorting stocks.
 MSCI's all-country world stock index lost 9.8 percent,
powering the short bias index up 5.8 percent. Yet short selling
has been the worst performing style this year, losing 7.8
percent even after May's good gain.
 One reason is that on average equity long-short hedge funds
are almost always net long -- meaning they gain when stocks rise
-- and were so in a big way at the beginning of the year.
 ""The average hedge fund went into this year net long. That's
been the biggest problem. They got caught by this (year's)
fall,"" said Will Bartleet, fund manager with HSBC Global
Investment Management's absolute return team.
 Many hedge funds also failed to see the sovereign debt
crisis coming, or at least to act on it.
 ""Positioning was all wrong,"" Bartleet said, adding that
there was a degree of complacency at work.
 
 MORE TO COME
 The silver lining for hedge funds is that their performance
has been better than that of many equity mutual funds year to
date. MSCI's main stocks index, for example, is still down 4.5
percent for the year, despite a 10 day rally this month.
 End-May comparisons were minus 7.4 percent for stocks, plus
1.5 for hedge funds.
 In that sense, hedge funds in general have met at least one
investor expectation, to protect clients' money, albeit without
much dynamism.
 The client base has also been changing. Institutional
investors such as pension funds, rather than wealthy
individuals, are now dominant, so their longer-term investment
horizons are likely to make them more tolerant of shorter-term
losses, such as those suffered in May.
 Which may be just as well. Executives meeting in Monaco at
the annual GAIM conference last week forecast May's spike in
market volatility could continue.
 ""(Hedge funds) can't deliver excellent returns in every
market condition, there's no such thing. There are opportunities
that come and go for certain styles,"" said Leda Braga, president
of BlueCrest Capital Management.
 Capital preservation was said to be the main goal for the
rest of this year at least.

 By Nick Olivari
 NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The dollar gained for the
second straight day against the euro on Tuesday as new concerns
about the funding needs of European banks offset
stronger-than-expected German economic data.
 The yuan declined against the dollar after China's weekend
pledge to allow its currency to trade more freely. The upward
momentum seen Monday that helped stoke demand for
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar faded
as investors acknowledged that a more flexible yuan policy
would not lead to a sharp appreciation in the currency.
 Euro zone bank woes again came to the fore after French
bank Credit Agricole pushed back profit targets for its
struggling Greek unit Emporiki on Tuesday and said it will take
a 400 million euro ($536.7 million) writedown as Greece fights
its debt load.
 Analysts said a ratings downgrade of French bank BNP
Paribas by Fitch and S&P's announcement on Monday that it was
raising its estimates for loan losses for Spain's banking
sector continued to weigh on the euro.
 The single currency extended losses after Moody's Investor
Services cut two Greek government-sponsored asset-backed
securities.
 ""The Credit Agricole, BNP and Moody's news has all brought
back into the limelight the likelihood of structural problems
in the euro zone,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc in Washington, D.C. ""The
impact from yesterday's China's news has definitely faded.""
 In early New York trade, the euro was down 0.2 percent at
$1.2274, with the session low at $1.2251.
 The single currency touched $1.2490 on electronic trading
platform EBS on Monday, its strongest point since May 24,
though it failed to break into the $1.25 region.
 Market participants said the euro would face more losses,
but technical analysts said near-term support was seen at
$1.2253, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rise from
a four-year low around $1.1875 on June 7 to Monday's high.
 The euro barely reacted to the German Ifo business climate
index, which hit a two-year peak in June, while the
expectations index fell.
 ""The positive surprise in the Ifo index failed to change
the market's negative mood. The fact that the expectations
component was downbeat did not help to support the single
currency,"" analysts at Credit Agricole CIB said in a note.
 The Swiss franc extended gains to a fresh all-time high
against the euro after the Swiss central bank's vice chairman
said the bank would not intervene in markets for now.
 The euro fell to a low of 1.3610 francs, according to
Reuters data, as an option barrier at 1.3650 franc gave away.
Traders said stops were triggered below that level and there
were more barriers at 1.3600.
 The euro fell 0.7 percent versus the yen to 111.25 yen. The
dollar fell 0.4 percent to 90.64 yen as the Japanese currency
rose across the board.
 CHINA IMPACT FADES
 China's pledge to revalue its currency had less impact on
markets on Tuesday.
 ""A moderate appreciation of the yuan will not change
China's current account situation and it won't imply the end of
global imbalances,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist
at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""Therefore there is no reason for a significant impact on
the euro/dollar or dollar/yen,"" he said. ""It would have to be
quite a large revaluation to have a lasting impact on the
majors.""
 The yuan's daily mid-point was set at 6.7980 per dollar on
Tuesday, the highest since its July 2005 revaluation, but the
Chinese currency relinquished gains as big, state-owned banks
heavily bought dollars.
 Sterling fell to a session low against the dollar but then
recovered, as UK Finance Minister George Osborne unveiled the
new government's first budget.

 (Updates with European trading, previous SINGAPORE)
 By Gus Trompiz and Naveen Thukral
 PARIS/SINGAPORE, June 22 (Reuters) - Chicago grain and
soybean futures eased on Tuesday, pressured by a broad pullback
in markets as investors took a more cautious view on a move by
China to allow its currency greater flexibility.
 A lack of bullish news encouraged selling in wheat after
strong grains last week, while favourable weather in a swathe of
the U.S. Midwest also kept corn and soybean prices in check.
 ""I don't see a whole lot fundamentally that can pull wheat
up, so the wheat rally is starting to come to an end,"" said
Scott Briggs, agricultural commodity strategist at ANZ in
Melbourne.
 ""Wheat has been pretty strong and probably has come to a
point that it has become attractive to sell.""
 Last week, front-month Chicago Board of Trade wheat rose 4.8
percent in its best weekly performance since mid-April as
traders remained fixated on heavy rains disrupting planting on
millions of acres in the Canadian Prairies.
 Weaker outside markets encouraged selling of grains, with
crude oil falling more than 1 percent to below $77 and world
shares breaking a 10-day rising run.
 China's weekend announcement that it would let the yuan have
more flexibility was initially welcomed as a signal the currency
would appreciate and boost Chinese purchasing power in
commodities like grains.
 But analysts stressed the gradual pace of revaluation
signalled by China would have only a modest impact on commodity
markets.
 
 WHEAT FALLS
 Chicago Board of Trade July wheat fell 1.30 percent to $4.56
a bushel by 1123 GMT after ending little changed on Monday
following a choppy session.
 In Europe, milling wheat futures in Paris also eased, having
failed to break resistance on Monday amid hesitant pre-harvest
trading. Benchmark November wheat was down 0.35 percent at
140.50 euros a tonne.
 CBOT July corn eased 1.06 percent to $3.51-1/4 a bushel,
after slipping 1.6 percent on Monday as a recent rally prompted
a wave of farmer selling. 
 The July soybean contract edged down 0.13 percent to $9.62 a
bushel, with the market underpinned by tight old-crop supplies.
 Analysts said old-crop soybeans are likely to rise to around
$10-$10.25 a bushel on tight supplies in the U.S. market.
 ""I can see beans still rallying just above 10 bucks,"" said
Briggs. ""In wheat and corn, I can see some heavy resistance
coming in, but in beans we don't see that coming until about
$10.00 to $10.25 for the August contract.""
 CBOT August delivery soybeans were quoted virtually
unchanged at $9.56-1/2.
 U.S. corn and soybean plants were benefiting from
greenhouse-like conditions created by heavy rains and warm
temperatures that blanketed the upper Midwest over the weekend.
 So far, U.S. corn and soybean crop ratings are above normal
given the great start to the 2010 growing season when a warm,
dry spring promoted early planting.
 Latest weekly crop progress data from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture showed a fall in ratings but this was broadly in
line with expectations after rains last week.

 (Adds finmin comment)
 By Niklas Pollard and Mia Shanley
 STOCKHOLM, June 22 (Reuters) - Sweden's unemployment rate
fell sharply last month, the statistics office said on Tuesday,
raising the likelihood that the central bank will hike interest
rates next week for the first time since the global financial
crisis.
 The jobless rate fell to 8.8 percent in May from 9.5 percent
in April, the statistics office said in a statement, coming in
well below the 9.3 percent seen in a Reuters poll of analysts.
 Finance Minister Anders Borg told Swedish news agency TT the
government could cut its forecast for unemployment this year as
the figures are better than it expected in its spring budget.
 ""That means it is reasonable to come to a forecast for
unemployment of under 9 percent, maybe 8.9 percent or 8.8
percent for 2010,"" Borg said.
 In April, the government forecast unemployment would average
9.2 percent in 2010.
 The Nordic country suffered its worst recession since World
War Two last year as the financial crisis slammed demand for
products manufactured by blue-chip firms such as world number
two truck maker Volvo and bearings maker SKF.
 But the pain proved to be short-lived.
 The economy expanded much more than expected in the first
quarter while the labour market, key for the centre-right
government facing elections in September, has shown signs of
having turned the corner.
 ""It's been a much sharper turnaround than expected. Most
forecasters one year ago expected the rate to peak above 11
percent, and now it looks like it peaked at about 9 percent and
is coming down,"" Handelsbanken analyst Jan Haggstrom said.
 In sharp contrast to the fiscal retrenchement seen elsewhere
in Europe, the outlook for Sweden's robust public finances has
also brightened significantly in recent months, leaving the
government free to hint at further stimulus.
 Confirmation that the labour market recovery is on solid
ground is seen as key for the Riksbank to begin raising its key
repo rate from the current record-low 0.25 percent, something it
has said it will do in summer or early autumn.
 In light of a string of strong economic indicators in recent
months, most analysts expect it to raise interest rates at its
next meeting on June 30. The rate decision is announced the
following day.
 Danske Markets analyst Roger Josefsson said the upbeat May
unemployment figures chimed well with the overall view of a firm
economic recovery and set the stage for the Riksbank's first
interest rate hike since 2008.
 ""One should be a bit cautious, because this (statistical)
series is still a bit volatile, but this is of course a strong
figure ... and, with all else equal, weighs in toward a July
hike, which I think most in the market are pretty much expecting
anyway,"" he said.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2010 07:42AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China to scrap export rebates despite yuan rise," * Move may ease trade frictions, consolidate steel sector
 * Cut for corn starch, ethanol to improve domestic supplies
 
 (Adds confirmation, details, background, comments)
 BEIJING/SHANGHAI, June 22 (Reuters) - China will scrap tax
rebates to exporters of dozens of commodities including key
steel products, corn starch, rubber products and ethanol, the
finance ministry said, while they also face a rise in the yuan.
 The decision has disappointed local steel mills, which were
hoping for more government support as they come up against
potentially calamitous margin pressures in the third quarter as
well as a further decline in exports as a result of the rising
yuan.
 ""Chinese steel exports have already been difficult and have
lacked price competitiveness, and we will face a much tougher
environment if some taxes aren't rebated,"" said an export
manager with a major steel mill.
 From July 15, the steel industry will see the removal of 9
percent tax rebates on hot-rolled steel coil, sections, some
narrow cold-rolled coil products and hot-dipped galvanized coil,
the ministry said on its website (www.mof.gov.cn) on Tuesday.
 The rebate cut was widely expected by the market, despite
denials by the China Iron and Steel Association last month. But
some traders had expected the government to relent following the
central bank's decision to allow the yuan to appreciate after 23
months.
 The decision to go ahead with the cuts suggests Beijing
remains determined to consolidate China's chaotic steel sector
as well as ease trade frictions.
 China's steel exporters have been subject to a series of
anti-dumping measures by the United States, which cited
subsidies in the form of low-cost loans, cheap land and export
tax incentives.
 
 CORN STARCH, COPPER
 The removal of a 5 percent rebate on corn starch and ethanol
is part of China's efforts to improve supplies on the domestic
market.
 China will also cancel 5 percent rebates on exports of
semi-finished copper products such as rods, bars, profiles and
wires, and semi-finished nickel products including plates,
sheets, strips, foils and tubes.
 Analysts said the copper export market would certainly feel
the impact.
 ""Without the rebates, there should be no margins (on the
exports),"" said Yang Changhua, a copper analyst at state-backed
research group Antaike.
 China will also remove 5 percent rebates on lead products
such as plates, zinc products such as bars, rods, profiles and
wire, and tin products such as bars, rods, profiles and wire.
 China is the world's top consumer of many base metals, and
the rebate cut could reduce outflows and affect the country's
metal consumption.
 But Yang played down the impact on the copper market, saying
exports were negligible compared to domestic consumption.
 In the first five months of the year, China exported 4,650
tonnes of copper bars, rods and profiles. The outflow was up 76
percent on the year.

 * IMF supports German stimulus exit - German official
 * Bank charge seen as test of G20's ability to get results

(Adds quotes, details)
 By Gernot Heller
 BERLIN, June 22 (Reuters) - The Group of 20 economic powers
is not demanding new stimulus measures and Germany will not be
attacked for its planned austerity drive at a G20 summit this
weekend, senior German government officials said on Tuesday.
 Speaking on condition of anonymity, one official said
progress on a banking charge was a key test of whether the G20
can find a joint position on important issues, despite the fact
G20 finance ministers had decided to give up on a common levy.
 Talks at the G20 summit in Toronto were likely to focus on
how to balance the need to sustain growth with efforts to pare
back public debt, one of the officials said in Berlin.
 Germany, Europe's largest economy, has defended government
plans to pursue savings measures of around 80 billion euros in
the next four years after U.S. President Barack Obama preached
patience in clamping down on public spending.
 However, Obama had not pressed Chancellor Angela Merkel to
ramp up stimulus spending in a recent telephone call, an
official said, adding that the two had decided to explore what
structural measures could be adopted to strengthen growth.
 Differences between the United States and Germany were
smaller than was generally assumed, he added.
 Proposals on how to coordinate a policy response would be
prepared under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for a G20 summit in Seoul in November, an official said.
 The IMF backed Germany's policies, one official said.
 ""The exit from economic stimulus measures in 2011 is
recognised as correct,"" the official said, adding that he did
not expect Germany to come under notable pressure over its
consolidation plans during the Toronto G20 summit.
 Germany needed to set an example to the rest of the European
Union on budgetary discipline, the official said.
 One official said the G20 format, which has increasingly
taken precedence over the G8 group as the main forum for
international economic policy debate, was proving harder to
reach decisions in due to its larger membership.
 ""The question of the banking charge for example is going to
be a test point from which it'll become clear whether the G20 is
in a position to formulate interests jointly or whether it
splits apart into two camps,"" he said.
 These would consist of those who said these kinds of policy
initiatives were ""not their problem"" and those who felt that
such issues played a key role in their agenda, he added.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - The euro retreated from a
one-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, tracking a
pullback in the yuan a day after China's pledge to allow its
currency to trade more freely had spurred risk demand.
 Upward momentum seen on Monday in the euro and higher-risk
currencies, including the Australian dollar, petered out as
investors acknowledged that a more flexible yuan policy would
not lead to a sharp appreciation in the currency.
 The yuan's daily mid-point  was set at 6.7980 per
dollar on Tuesday, the highest since its July 2005 revaluation,
but the Chinese currency relinquished gains as big, state-owned
banks heavily bought dollars. [ID:nTOE65L04K]
 Looser yuan controls are seen as positive for the global
economy as they will help address global imbalances and cool
Chinese inflation risks.
 But analysts said the view the yuan's gains would be modest
prompted investors to put on pause the euro's short-covering
rally in the wake of the single currency's tumble to a four-year
low against the dollar earlier this month.
 ""A moderate appreciation of the yuan will not change China's
current account situation and it won't imply the end of global
imbalances,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""Therefore there is no reason for a significant impact on
the euro/dollar or dollar/yen,"" he said. ""It would have to be
quite a large revaluation to have a lasting impact on the

 Analysts said a ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas
by Fitch and S&P's announcement it was raising its estimates for
loan losses for Spain's banking sector on Monday also weighed
down the euro [ID:nN21250262] [ID:nLDE65K1TE].
 By 0914 GMT, the euro  traded at $1.2288, slightly
lower on the day and near the day's low of $1.2285. The single
currency pulled back from $1.2490 hit on Monday, its strongest
since May 24, after failing to break into the $1.25 region.
 Market participants said the euro would face more losses,
but technical analysts said near-term support was seen at
$1.2253, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rise from a
four-year low around $1.1875 on June 7 to Monday's high.
 The euro barely reacted to the German Ifo index, which
showed a higher-than-expected reading of business sentiment,
which hit a two-year high in June, while the expectations index
was slightly weaker than forecast. [ID:nBAE003791]
 
 EASING POLITICAL TENSIONS
 The Australian dollar  was little changed at
$0.8763, staying off $0.8860 hit on Monday, its strongest since
mid-May. 
 The commodity-linked Australian unit is seen benefiting from
a stronger yuan on the view that a firmer Chinese currency will
boost purchasing power and increase demand for the natural
resources China needs to further develop its economy.
 The dollar index <.DXY> was a touch higher at 86.066, having
reversed a fall to a one-month low on Monday. Analysts said this
suggested more gains for the greenback in the near term.
 Still, the dollar  was nearly half a percent weaker at
90.55 yen as the Japanese currency rose across the board.
 The yuan slipped even as China has indicated it would let it
rise further after Monday's surge, but analysts pointed out that
the move by Beijing's central bank had helped to quell political
tensions before a Group of 20 meeting later this week.
 BTM UFJ analysts said in a note that bilateral trade
tensions between the U.S. and China had now diminished
considerably.
 ""The G20 meeting now in Canada should proceed smoothly while
the release of the semi-annual currency report by the U.S.
Treasury department after the summit can now be released without
citing China as a currency manipulato,"" the analysts said.
 They added that the looser yuan policy should in time have
the biggest impact on Asian currencies, while it would have a
much more muted impact on the majors.

 (Adds detail, background, analyst comment)
 By Niklas Pollard and Mia Shanley
 STOCKHOLM, June 22 (Reuters) - Sweden's unemployment rate
fell sharply last month, the statistics office said on Tuesday,
raising the likelihood that the central bank will hike interest
rates next week for the first time since the global financial
crisis.
 The jobless rate fell to 8.8 percent in May from 9.5 percent
in April, the statistics office said in a statement, coming in
well below the 9.3 percent seen in a Reuters poll of analysts.
 ""They were positive figures. Unemployment is sinking faster
than we had expected, and our expectation was below consensus,""
said Elisabet Kopelman, analyst at Swedish bank SEB.
 The Nordic country suffered its worst recession since World
War Two last year as the financial crisis slammed demand for
products manufactured by blue-chip firms such as world number
two truck maker Volvo and bearings maker SKF.
 But the pain proved to be short-lived.
 The economy expanded much more than expected in the first
quarter while the labour market, key for the centre-right
government facing elections in September, has shown signs of
having turned the corner.
 ""It's been a much sharper turnaround than expected. Most
forecasters one year ago expected the rate to peak above 11
percent, and now it looks like it peaked at about 9 percent and
is coming down,"" Handelsbanken analyst Jan Haggstrom said.
 In sharp contrast to the fiscal retrenchement seen elsewhere
in Europe, the outlook for Sweden's robust public finances has
also brightened significantly in recent months, leaving the
government free to hint at further stimulus.
 Confirmation that the labour market recovery is on solid
ground is seen as key for the Riksbank to begin raising its key
repo rate from the current record-low 0.25 percent, something it
has said it will do in summer or early autumn.
 In light of a string of strong economic indicators in recent
months, most analysts expect it to raise interest rates at its
next meeting on June 30. The rate decision is announced the
following day.
 Danske Markets analyst Roger Josefsson said the upbeat May
unemployment figures chimed well with the overall view of a firm
economic recovery and set the stage for the Riksbank's first
interest rate hike since 2008.
 ""One should be a bit cautious, because this (statistical)
series is still a bit volatile, but this is of course a strong
figure ... and, with all else equal, weighs in toward a July
hike, which I think most in the market are pretty much expecting
anyway,"" he said.

 * Says G20 leaders must pull together, not make accusations
 BEIJING, June 22 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday stuck to its
guns on the pace of exchange rate reform, reaffirming that
change must remain gradual and controllable.
 China's trading partners are anxious for Beijing to spell
out how quickly it will let the yuan rise after it said on
Saturday that it was ending the currency's 23-month-old peg to
the dollar.
 Some leaders at this weekend's Group of 20 summit in Toronto
might even want China to produce a schedule of sorts, Canadian
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Monday. [ID:nNYC003401]
 But Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said Beijing would
act as it saw fit and would not be rushed.
 ""I want to stress that we will adhere to further reforming
the renminbi's exchange rate formation mechanism following the
principles of maintaining initiative, controllability and
gradualness, enhancing the elasticity of the exchange rate. This
direction will remain unchanged,"" he told a regular briefing.
 The yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), fell back on
Tuesday as the authorities made good on their promise to create
two-way movement in an exchange rate that many economists
believe is headed inexorably higher in the long run.
 Qin did not give a direct answer when asked whether
President Hu Jintao would discuss the yuan in Toronto, but he
noted that previous G20 summits had not singled out individual
currencies.
 ""This summit is taking place when the global economy is
mounting a steady recovery and basically reviving, but that
recovery remains unsteady and uneven. So the pressing task for
G20 members is to discuss how to enhance communication and
cooperation,"" he said.
 As such, the imperative for leaders in Toronto should be to
demonstrate a determination to overcome adversity together.
""They should not engage in mutual accusations and pressure,"" he
said.
 The greatest pressure on China is being exerted by some U.S.
lawmakers, including Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who are
threatening punitive measures against imports from China.
 They are demanding that China let the yuan rise sharply to
correct what they see as an artificial undervaluation that hands
the country's exporters an unfair advantage in global markets.
 But Chen Ping, a professor at the China Centre for Economic
Research of Peking University, said Beijing should keep the yuan
pegged to the dollar to minimise currency risks for exporters.
 He called Saturday's announcement of greater exchange rate
flexibility a form of ""passive defence"" by Beijing to fend off
U.S. pressure at the G20 and said disputes over the currency
were likely to continue in the absence of a big shift.
 ""The Americans will say the Chinese are dishonest and point
out that there has been only a declaration of intent to float
the exchange rate but no change in reality,"" Chen told an
academic seminar.

than fewer U.S. Treasury bonds if the yuan appreciates, a senior
official at Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.
 Expectations that following Beijing's shift to a more
flexible currency regime China may need to buy fewer Treasury
bonds than in the past when it tried to hold down the value of
the yuan, pushed down U.S. government bond prices on Monday.
 ""I don't buy that story. It's not necessarily the case,""
Brian Coulton, head of global economics at the ratings agency,

 He said expectations of an appreciating yuan would boost
capital flows into China, resulting in increasing currency
reserves and in turn a greater need to invest them in liquid U.S.
Treasury bonds.
 Coulton, in Seoul for a seminar, also said China's move to
allow more flexibility in the yuan regime would not prompt in
itself a ratings upgrade but was supportive of the country's
current A-plus long-term rating.
 He added the risk of the euro zone economy falling into a
double-dip recession has increased over the past three months
mainly due to weakened confidence in the private sector about the

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - World stocks fell for the first
time in two weeks on Tuesday as investors took some profits on a
cooler assessment of China's weekend decision to give its
currency more flexibility.
 A Fitch ratings debt downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas
 hit financial stocks, while Britain's efforts to cap
public borrowing in an austere budget drove the value of its
debt higher.
 Wall Street also looked set for losses.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> fell 0.8
percent, looking set for its first loss since June 7. In the
period in between, the benchmark has gained more than 7 percent.
 Investors have tentatively embraced riskier assets over the
past fortnight as their worst fears about a euro zone sovereign
debt collapse have eased.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 1.3 percent after
rallying for nine sessions in a row. Banks were among the top
losers because of the Fitch move.
 ""Now, everybody thinks that BNP is one of the most solid
banks, so the heat is more on (Societe Generale) and Credit
Agricole, and the latter gave a grim update on its exposure to
Greece today,"" said IG analyst Philippe De Vandiere.
 Investors were also taking a more considered view of the
impact of China's plan for more currency flexibility and grew
sceptical about how much Beijing would actually allow the yuan
to rise. Stocks outside the United States had risen sharply on
the news
 ""People gave much more weight to the currency move than it
deserved,"" said Koen De Leus, economist at KBC Securities.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei <.N225> closed down 1.2 percent, a
day after bouncing to a one-month high.
 
 BUDGET WOES
 Britain's tough budget sent sterling to day lows while the

 Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> also extended losses to fall 1.7

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 22 (Reuters) - The euro retreated from a
one-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, tracking a
pullback in the yuan a day after China pledged to allow its
currency to trade more freely.
 Upward momentum seen on Monday in the euro and higher-risk
currencies including the Australian dollar petered out as
investors acknowledged that a more flexible yuan policy would
not lead to a sharp appreciation in the currency.
 The yuan's daily mid-point was set at 6.7980 per dollar on
Tuesday, the highest since its July 2005 revaluation but the
Chinese currency relinquished gains as big, state-owned banks
heavily bought dollars.
 Looser yuan controls are seen as positive for the global
economy as they will help address global imbalances and cool
Chinese inflation risks. China's central bank has indicated it
would let the yuan rise further after the previous day's surge.
 But analysts said the view the yuan's gains would be subtle
prompted investors to pause the euro's short-covering rally in
the wake of the single currency's tumble to a four-year low
against the dollar earlier this month.
 ""A moderate appreciation of the yuan will not change China's
current account situation and it won't imply the end of global
imbalances,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""Therefore there is no reason for a significant impact on
the euro/dollar or dollar/yen,"" he said. ""It would have to be
quite a large revaluation to have a lasting impact on the
majors.""
 Analysts said a ratings downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas
by Fitch and S&P's announcement it was raising its estimates for
loan losses for Spain's banking sector on Monday also helped
weigh down the euro.
 By 0726 GMT, the euro traded at $1.2318, unchanged on the
day after hitting the day's low of $1.2285. The single currency
pulled back from $1.2490 hit on Monday, its strongest since May
24, after failing to break into the $1.25 region.
 Near-term support was seen at $1.2253, a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the rise from a four-year low of
$1.1875 on June 7 to Monday's high.
 The euro barely reacted to the German Ifo index, which
showed a higher-than-expected reading of the business climate
and current conditions, while the expectations index was
slightly weaker than forecast.
 The Australian dollar traded 0.4 percent higher at $0.8787,
but stayed off $0.8860 hit on Monday, its strongest since
mid-May. 
 The commodity-linked Australian unit is seen benefiting from
a stronger yuan, in part as it may help to boost demand for the
natural resources China needs to further develop its economy.
 The dollar index was flat at 85.885, having reversed a fall
to a one-month low on Monday. Market participants said this
suggested more gains for the greenback in the near term. The
dollar was up 0.3 percent at 90.77 yen.

intervention
 * Yuan retreats after biggest one-day surge since
revaluation
 By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, June 22 (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan slipped on
Tuesday as big state-owned banks heavily bought dollars, a move
that suggests the central bank has adopted a new strategy to
control the pace of yuan gains.
 The yuan jumped initially after the People's Bank of China
set the mid-point start to trade at a surprisingly strong
6.7980, little changed from Monday's close and catching market
players off guard who had thought it would try to nudge the
currency lower after the previous day's surge.
 The heavy dollar buying quickly drove the yuan well off a
low of 6.7900 -- the lowest since the 2005 revaluation -- and
up as high as 6.8229 on the day, a drop of 0.37 percent. The
yuan last traded at 6.8189.
 On Monday, the currency posted its biggest one-day rise
since the revaluation, rising nearly half a percent and almost
touching the upper it of its daily trading band on either side
of the mid-point.
 Some traders believe the buying by state-owned banks was on
behalf of the PBOC to avoid direct market intervention, as it
had often done in the post-revaluation appreciation phase and
de facto dollar peg of the past two years.
 By letting state-owned banks buy dollars, the PBOC is
effectively limiting the market's ability to short dollar/yuan
-- especially because banks are not allowed to hold short
positions overnight in the spot currency market.
 ""It appears a new strategy,"" said a senior dealer at a
European bank in Shanghai. ""The central bank needn't intervene
in the market, but it can still keep the pace of yuan
appreciation under control via a control of supply and demand.""
 Because the state-owned banks were scooping up dollars at a
wide variety of levels, it suggested that they were not trying
to defend the yuan at a certain level, traders said.
 But since the peg to the dollar was ditched over the
weekend, the PBOC appears to be trying to foster much more
two-way trade within the daily trading band, seeking to get
banks and companies used greater volatility and hedging
currency risks.
 During the 2005-2008 managed float against a trade-weighted
currency basket and subsequent peg to the dollar, the PBOC
often squashed intraday volatility via direct intervention,
guidance through the mid-point and dollar purchases by
state-owned banks.
 Now it appears to be backing away from direct intervention
unless the extremes of the daily trading band are tested.
 The PBOC has made clear that it would not allow the yuan to
appreciate sharply in its statements over the weekend
announcing the latest reforms of the yuan, ruling out a one-off
revaluation.
 BASKET
 Despite the announced intention of controlling the pace of
yuan appreciation against the dollar, the PBOC showed it was
backing its words with deeds by allowing the yuan to rise
against European currencies on Tuesday.
 The PBOC set the yuan's mid-point higher against the euro,
at 8.3816, and against sterling after the currencies weakened
overnight. That set the tone for the yuan to trade higher
against the euro at 8.3764 at midday on Tuesday from a close of
8.4325 the previous day.
 The yuan can rise up to 3 percent against currencies
besides the dollar.
 ""The question is how far the yuan can go,"" said a senior
dealer at a North American bank in Shanghai. ""We believe the
central bank must have some limits, which may gradually become
clear over time after the G20 summit.""
 Offshore dollar/yuan forwards rose back up after initial
falls that had implied more yuan appreciation, buoyed by the
dollar/yuan mid-point setting.
 Some players in the NDF market have turned cautious about
shorting dollar/yuan, worried that this week's yuan move was
done primarily to appease critics before the G20 summit late
this week, and later moves may be more subdued.
 Three-month dollar-yuan non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
were quoted at 6.7380, implying a yuan rise of 0.89 percent
after they fell to a low of 6.7080 in early trade.
 One-year NDFs rose back to 6.6300 after hitting an initial
low of 6.5970, trimming implied appreciation to 2.53 percent
from 3.05 percent the previous day.

 * ""The proof will be in the pudding,"" says Canadian PM
 By Jason Subler and Lu Jianxin
 SHANGHAI, June 22 (Reuters) - China pulled back the veil on
its new currency regime a little further on Tuesday, appearing
to engineer a fall in the yuan to make clear its vow of
flexibility did not include one-way bets for appreciation.
 Big Chinese state-owned banks kept the yuan in check, a day
after its biggest rise since the currency was revalued in 2005,
indicating Beijing will allow its currency to appreciate at a
far slower pace than demanded by its critics in the West.
 The two-way movement in the yuan is not great by the
standard of freely floated currencies but is unprecedented in
China where until this week the central bank had squashed
intraday volatility via intervention.
 China is relaxing its control on the yuan ahead of this
weekend's G20 summit of world leaders in Canada, breaking a
two-year dollar peg that had been a lightning rod for critics
who say the currency is undervalued and gives Chinese exporters
an unfair trade advantage.
 ""China has backed up all the talk with action, and
President Hu (Jintao) will arrive in Toronto later this week
with tangible evidence that China is serious about increasing
the flexibility of its exchange rate,"" said Brian Jackson,
strategist with Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 ""We still may see moves in either direction from day to
day, but we think the trend in the weeks and months ahead will
be for the yuan to make limited but meaningful gains against
the dollar.""
 The yuan rose more than 0.4 percent on Monday, its biggest
rise since the landmark revaluation in 2005, pushing up close
to its trading limit of 0.5 percent either side of a reference
point set each day by the central bank.
 On Tuesday, the central bank set the reference rate at
about the same level as Monday's close, leaving room in theory
for the currency to rise another 0.5 percent.
 The yuan immediately rose to a new five-year high before
turning lower. State-owned banks also stepped in to the market
and aggressively bought dollars, suggesting authorities want to
control the pace of the yuan's appreciation.
 The People's Bank of China, the central bank, made no
secret that it would not allow the yuan to appreciate too fast
in statements over the weekend announcing the currency reform.
 By allowing for greater ups and downs, the central bank
will move a step closer to its long-stated aim of developing a
more mature market in which companies learn to hedge against
foreign exchange risks, part of its overall efforts to develop
Shanghai into a global financial centre by 2020.
 Still, markets and critics in the United States and other
countries are unlikely to be easily convinced of the depth of
the reforms unless they see significant appreciation of the
yuan.
 Markets surged on Monday after Beijing's weekend vow, on
optimism a stronger currency would boost the fast-growing
economy's purchasing power.
 But doubts about the speed of yuan appreciation had already
begun to surface in the United States on Monday. Asian stocks
then reversed their gains on Tuesday as investors took profits
from the rally on Monday.
 Commodities also pared their gains, as did commodity-linked
currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars.
 HOW FLEXIBLE?
 Many economists see China's currency strengthening further
in coming days but at a very modest pace, further diluting
hopes for big market gains.
 A Reuters poll of 33 economists showed they expected the
yuan to end the year at 6.67 per dollar, a rise of 2.4 percent
from late last week before China's policy announcement and
similar to the appreciation implied by offshore non-deliverable
forwards.
 The challenge for China going into this weekend's G20
summit will be to convince other countries, many of which are
expected to seek further clarification from Beijing, that it
has made a genuine move to a more flexible currency.
 ""We're obviously encouraged, but we'll be monitoring the
progress,"" White House spokesman Bill Burton said in
Washington. ""Implementation here is going to be key, and so
we're just going to be keeping an eye on that.""
 A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said China's gradual approach to yuan flexibility
was a prudent step that could both manage expectations and
deter massive speculative buying of Chinese assets.
 The official said it was promising that China seemed ready
to allow the exchange rate to respond to market forces, and
that the test now was how far and how fast Beijing would permit
the yuan to move.
 ""The proof will be in the pudding over time,"" Canadian
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in an interview with
Reuters.
 ""But I think it's fair to say this is a very positive
announcement by China. More broadly it does show China not
simply doing some positive things, but China assuming a more
global view,"" he said.

 European shares were expected to follow Asian and U.S.
stock markets into the red, with Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE>,
Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> and France's CAC-40 <.FCHI> seen opening
as much as 1 percent lower.
 In addition to concerns about China, financial markets
turned cautious ahead of Britain's budget later in the day,
which is expected to contain massive spending cuts and tax
rises as worries about sovereign debt levels spread throughout
Europe.
 China's currency reforms initially sparked a global rally
in riskier assets on Monday on hopes that a stronger yuan would
boost its already formidable purchasing power for imported
goods and raw materials, giving the global economic recovery a
much-needed shot in the arm.
 But that euphoria quickly vanished as investors took a more
considered view of the impact the move would have on China's
actual near-term demand and grew sceptical about how much
Beijing would allow the yuan to rise.
 Big Chinese state-owned banks kept the yuan in check on
Tuesday, a day after its biggest rise since the currency was
revalued in 2005, indicating Beijing will allow the currency to
appreciate at a far slower pace than demanded by its critics in
the West. [ID:nSGE65L00R]
 Japan's Nikkei <.N225> slipped 1.2 percent as foreign
investors turned sellers after the benchmark powered to a

 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 1 percent, with losses in technology
<.MIAPJIT00PUS> and resources <.MIAPJMT00PUS> sectors providing
the main drag. On Monday, the index had bolted 3.2 percent to a
five-week high as China allowed the yuan to rise.
 ""I don't believe China is doing this because the world is
in fantastic shape and the outlook is exceedingly bright,"" said
Emil Wolter, head of regional strategy at Royal Bank of
Scotland.
 ""They are doing it for political reasons,"" he said
referring to a meeting later this week of leaders of the Group
of 20 leading industrialized and developing economies in
Canada, where global trade imbalances are expected to be a key
issue.
 Wolter said China's announcement on the yuan was a welcome
respite for markets after the worst May in 12 years, which had
seen investors take substantial short positions. The size of
the gains on Monday may have been amplified as traders
scrambled to close out such bets against the market.
 ""Sell in May and go away"" is an old stock market adage
which refers to the seasonal weakness in shares.
 Attention will also be focused on whether the U.S. Federal
Reserve will reiterate its commitment to keeping interest rates
exceptionally low for an ""extended period"" at the end of its
two-day meeting on Wednesday. [ID:nN17269337]
 CHINA SYNDROME
 China's central bank set the yuan's daily mid-point
 at 6.7980 against the dollar on Tuesday, the highest
level since the yuan's revaluation in July 2005, signalling it
could allow the yuan to rise further.
 But the move gave markets only a brief respite from early
selling pressure as the spot rate soon fell. The yuan rose to
as high as 6.7900 in early trade, up 0.11 percent from Monday,
when it jumped nearly 0.5 percent. But by afternoon it had
slipped 0.35 percent.
 Tuesday's fixing initially reignited demand for riskier
currency trades, with the Australian dollar  and the euro
 jumping to the day's high against the dollar. But again
the rise was short-lived and by afternoon the euro 
dipped 0.27 percent to $1.2289.
 The Australian dollar rose as high as $0.8834 , up
from around $0.8765 just before the mid-point was announced.
The Australian dollar then dipped and by afternoon it was flat.
 ""Investors are growing more cautious on the view that the
magnitude of the yuan's new flexibility may not be as big as
the market had earlier hoped,"" said Lee Sun-yeb, a market
analyst at Shinhan Investment Corporation in Seoul.
 ""It seems the market is taking a bit of breather following
its recent sharp gains, as it nears the earlier highs. Foreign
buying has also halted.""
 Analysts expect more volatility ahead as markets test how
much yuan appreciation Beijing is willing to stomach.
 ""The authorities want to say they are showing a more hands
off approach and more flexibility in the markets, but the
reality is they are introducing more intraday volatility in the
market,"" said Craig Chan, senior FX strategist at Nomura
International.

 * Euro, Aussie hit day's highs after yuan mid-point announced
 * But traders see yuan as short-term trading factor
 By Rika Otsuka
 TOKYO, June 22 (Reuters) - The euro slipped on Tuesday,
giving back gains made after China set the yuan's mid-point at
its highest since the yuan's revaluation in 2005, as players
wondered how fast the Chinese authorities would let their
currency rise.
 The euro and the Australian dollar hit their highs for the
day after China's central bank set the yuan's daily mid-point at
6.7980 against the dollar, stronger than Monday's 6.8275 per
dollar. Traders took it as a sign it could allow the yuan to rise
further.
 The rise in the euro and the Australian dollar was
short-lived, however, as spot yuan eased against the dollar after
soaring to its highest level since its July 2005 revaluation.
 ""The euro and the Aussie slipped simply because the yuan
eased, with some players suspecting Chinese authorities might be
intervening to rein in the yuan's rise,"" said a senior FX trader
at a big Japanese brokerage.
 The market took the yuan 0.42 percent higher on Monday, its
biggest one-day rise since the 2005 revaluation. But dealers fear
the central bank will not let the market keep boosting the yuan
at the pace seen the previous day.
 The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.2298, off the day's peak of
$1.2355. It hit a one-month high of $1.2490 on trading platform
EBS on Monday after China pledged to allow the yuan to rise,
boosting confidence in the global economy.
 Near-term support was seen at $1.2253, a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the rise from a four-year low of $1.1875
on June 7 to Monday's high of $1.2490.
 On the other hand, the dollar index was up 0.1 percent at
86.01, holding well above support at 85.13. The index posted a
bullish reversal on Monday, suggesting more gains for the
greenback in the near term.
 Beijing's vow of flexibility for the yuan, which should boost
purchasing power and demand in the the world's third-largest
economy, had initially fuelled a rally in risky assets on Monday.
 But the rally ebbed with not much follow-through buying, with
China's move undertaken primarily for political purposes,
analysts said. Leaders of the Group of 20 leading industrialised
and developing economies are to meet next week in Toronto, where
global trade imbalances are expected to be a key issue.
 China on Monday ruled out a one-off revaluation and said it
will reform its exchange rate regime in a gradual manner.
 ""The Chinese decision provided a welcoming short-term
distraction in a market gripped by fear and anxiety, but the
underlying European fiscal headaches and global growth
uncertainties remain unaltered,"" wrote Matthew Strauss, currency
strategist at RBC Capital.
 Some traders said they expect the yuan to be a short-term
trading factor until a bigger trend comes to the market.
 RBC's Strauss said the euro's failure to break past
resistance near $1.25 was likely to result in a period for
weakness for the single currency. Against the yen, the euro was
down 0.3 percent at 111.94, having shed about 0.2 percent on
Monday.
 The euro in recent months has moved with swings in risk
appetite. On Monday, the 25-day rolling correlation between the
euro and the S&P 500 was at a robust 54 percent.
 The fading risk rally was also evident in stock markets.
 The Australian dollar, which had gained 1.4 percent in the
previous session, was at $0.8785, with support at $0.8750 --
Monday's low -- and strong resistance at Monday's $0.8860 high.
 The Aussie jumped to hit the day's peak at $0.8834 after the
yuan mid-point fixing.

 By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, June 22 (Reuters) - China's yuan pulled back
against the dollar on Tuesday after an early surge to a fresh
post-revaluation high, showing renewed volatility after the
central bank signalled it would let the currency continue rising.
 The People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily mid-point at
6.7980 against the dollar on Tuesday, the highest since the
yuan's revaluation in July 2005, indicating it would let the yuan
rise further after the previous day's surge.
 The PBOC also sent a strong signal to the market by setting
the yuan's mid-point higher against the euro, at 8.3816 versus
Monday's 8.4825, and against sterling, at 10.0372 versus 10.1382,
despite the currencies' global weakness.
 China maintains huge trade surpluses with Europe as well as
with the United States.
 The mid-point settings show that China is following through
on its statements over the weekend that it would allow the yuan
to move more in line with currencies of a trade-weighted basket.
 ""The question now is how far the yuan can go,"" said a senior
dealer at a major European bank in Shanghai.
 ""Technically speaking, yesterday's yuan rally against the
dollar was already overdone as it was not backed up by specific
near-term positive news for China.
 ""So you will see volatility today as you cannot expect
uninterrupted rises in the yuan without support from hard news.""
 Spot yuan opened at 6.7968 against the dollar and quickly
rose to a fresh post-revaluation high of 6.7900 in early trade,
but then slumped back to an intraday low of 6.8160. Most trading
was done around 6.8100, traders said.
 EUROPEAN CURRENCIES
 The yuan also traded higher against the euro at 8.3765 versus
Monday's close of 8.4325, guided by the yuan/euro mid-point.
 The yuan may rise or fall 0.5 percent from its mid-point each
day against the dollar, and up to 3 percent against non-dollar
currencies.
 Offshore, dollar-yuan forwards fell to imply more yuan
appreciation, buoyed by the central bank's mid-point setting.
 Many investors believed the level of Tuesday's mid-point
would be pivotal as a signal to the world on how fast China would
allow the yuan to rise.
 Others were more cautious, however, warning that this week's
move was largely eyeing the G20 summit late this week, and later
moves may be more subdued.
 ""The trajectory is pretty clear,"" said Craig Chan, an analyst
at Nomura in Singapore.
 ""You have the G20 meeting coming. I think the last thing they
want to do is see volatility and have dollar/yuan being traded
higher. It's going to be difficult for them to go into G20 and
say we are helping the world with a weaker yuan.""
 Three-month dollar-yuan non-deliverable forwards fell to a
low of 6.7080 on Tuesday morning, implying expectations for the
yuan to rise 1.34 percent over that period from the day's
mid-point.
 One-year NDFs fell to a low of 6.5970, implying expectations
for the yuan to rise 3.05 percent rise in a year.

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, June 22 (Reuters) - Japan set ambitious targets to
rein in its debt on Tuesday that it said could not be met even
under its rosiest growth scenario, the latest indication that
the government will have to push through contentious tax hikes
to fill deep fiscal gaps.
 In a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, new Prime
Minister Naoto Kan has made fiscal reform a top priority ahead
of a July 11 upper house election, vowing to consider doubling
the 5 percent sales tax, although not for at least two or three
years.
 ""As shown by the Greek example, the market's view on the
size of outstanding public debt or sovereign risk has become
very severe,"" Kan said in a televised debate with other party
leaders.
 ""If we could sustain the social welfare system forever by
issuing deficit financing bonds, there would be no need to
bring up the issue of the sales tax,"" he added. ""But if left
alone, our social welfare system will collapse.""
 Credit ratings agency Moody's welcomed the plan as a step
in the right direction to fiscal health, but analysts said the
long-mooted rise in the consumption tax was vital for the
targets to be met.
 Indeed the Cabinet Office's projections showed that it
would not be able to bring the primary budget balance into the
black within a decade, as outlined in the fiscal plan, under
the government's growth strategy, which aims for an average 2
percent real growth by fiscal 2020/21.
 Investors will be watching to see how the tax reform debate
progresses after the upper house election, which Kan's
Democratic Party needs to win to smooth policymaking.
 Tuesday's plan did not factor in any tax hikes but said the
government should reach an early conclusion on overhauling the
sales tax and other taxes.
 The fiscal programme supported government bond prices, with
the benchmark 10-year futures prices edging near a two-year
high hit earlier this month.
 ""A hike in the consumption tax was politically taboo in the
past. Now it is becoming more realistic. That's one reason
behind JGBs' firmness,"" said Katsutoshi Inadome, a fixed-income
strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
 ""That's not to say investors are convinced that fiscal
reform will succeed. They are watching whether the government
can carry out the reform,"" he added.
 COALITION DYNAMICS
 Ratings agencies have threatened to cut Japan's sovereign
debt rating unless it shows a credible plan to rein in its
debt.
 ""The mention of tax is implicit recognition that something
along the lines of a tax hike would be necessary,"" said David
Cohen, director of Asian economic forecasting, at Action
Economics in Singapore.
 Economists say the government needs to commit to raising
the sales tax to 15 percent or even 20 percent over the next 10
to 15 years to pay for rising social welfare costs and a
commitment to hike tax is needed to make its fiscal plans look
credible. But many also worry tax hikes could hurt growth.
 The plan lacked specific ideas of how to meet its long-term
aim of achieving budget balance targets and reducing its
debt-to-GDP ratio -- now estimated at nearly twice the size of
GDP, the worst in the developed world.
 Kan has put a debate on a consumption tax hike at the heart
of the Democratic Party's campaign for the upper house poll,
which the party needs to win to ensure smooth policymaking.
 Coalition dynamics could complicate the push for fiscal
reform if the Democrats fall short of a majority in the upper
house, which can delay bills, although analysts say a future
sales tax rise is inevitable.
 ""At the end of the day, most people realise that a rise (in
the sales tax) is a question of time. It has to be done at some
time and the question is the timing and what should be done
first,"" said Koichi Nakano, a Sophia University professor.
 Japan's 5 percent consumption tax rate is among the lowest
in major economies. It compares with 17.5 percent in Britain,
19 percent in Germany and Greece, 10 percent in South Korea as
of January 2010. New York City imposes a 8.875 percent sales
tax, according to the Cabinet Office.
 The government pledged to do its utmost to keep new debt
issuance in the year to next March at or below about the 44
trillion yen ($483 billion) that has been earmarked for this
year, while aiming to steadily reduce bond issuance thereafter.
 The government still has a massive pool of bank deposits to
fund its deficits in the near term. But fears that this could
change in the long term as an ageing population starts drawing
on savings have led to a rise in demand for protection against
the risk of default in Japanese government bonds in the credit
default swaps market.
 To ease such concerns, the plan calls for Japan to bring
its primary budget balance into the black within a decade -- a
goal it has not met since the bursting of an asset bubble early
in the 1990s. The primary budget balance, which excludes
revenue from bond sales and debt-servicing costs, is estimated
at 30.8 trillion yen, or 6.4 percent of GDP in the current
fiscal year.
 From fiscal 2021/22 the government will aim to stably lower
the debt-to-GDP ratio.

 By Lee Shin-hyung and Yoo Choonsik
 SEOUL, June 22 (Reuters) - South Korea on Tuesday flagged a
plan to tweak currency trading rules unveiled just over a week
ago and tighten limits imposed on foreign banks, unsettling
currency and bond markets with a sudden policy flip-flop.
 A senior finance ministry official said that the government
planned to eventually bring the limits in line with lower caps
set for domestic banks, though it had not been decided when.
 However, another official told Reuters later identical
limits for local and foreign banks might be still years away.
 On June 13, the authorities announced curbs on banks'
trading of currency derivatives, saying they aimed to prevent
sharp capital swings that have repeatedly plagued South Korea
at times of market turbulence.
 The rules, expected to come into force in October, set a
ceiling of 50 percent of equity capital for currency
derivatives positions of domestic banks and a 250 percent cap
for foreign bank branches to account for their typically much
lower capital.
 On average, equity capital of foreign bank branches
represents just 1/30 of that of domestic banks and market
analysts had said that setting the same limits on local and
foreign banks would effectively shut out the latter from the
currency forwards market where they are the dominant players.
 ""The government's basic stance is that we should not
discriminate against domestic banks in relation to foreign bank
branches,"" Kim Ik-joo, head of the finance ministry's
international finance bureau, told Reuters.
 Another official involved in drafting and implementing the
currency regulations, played down the likelihood of changes to
the rulebook any time soon, though officials said the long-term
goal was to have the same standards for local and foreign
banks.
 ""The government can do that in the long term, probably five
or 10 years. It is hard to do that in the short term,"" said the
official, who declined to be identified because he was not
authorised to talk to the press.
 ""Foreign bank branches played a positive role as dollar
suppliers, so we may see a dollar shortage if the government
toughened the rules so quickly. It needs time.""
 BENDING THE RULES?
 Traders and bankers responded to the suggestion of another
rule change with disbelief and disappointment, with some
suggesting the ministry was merely venting its frustration over
media reports that banks were already finding ways around the
new rules.
 ""The authorities do not like to see media reports that they
are increasing positions and using dual books,"" said Jeong
My-young, a currency strategist at Samsung Futures.
 Treasury bond futures  turned lower after early
gains, with net foreign selling of front-end futures reaching a
six-month high. The won   dipped on concerns
additional steps could dampen fund inflows.
 South Korean media reported that branches of foreign banks
were boosting their currency forwards before the new limits
kick in and some were shifting reporting of their trades to
overseas branches, though financial regulators have said they
have not spotted such movement yet.
 ""If the caps are curtailed, it will send markets into a
panic. It is obvious that funding conditions at foreign bank
branches are different from local banks,"" said a head of a
foreign bank branch in Seoul. The banker said lower limits
would force foreign banks to move their swaps and arbitrage
trade out of South Korea.
 The rules adopted this month aim to mitigate the side
effects of a persistent imbalance in the currency market
between heavy supply of dollars from shipbuilders and other big
exporters and their demand for hedging and subdued demand from
importers.
 This imbalance drives down the cost of borrowing dollars,
encouraging big capital inflows in the form of short-term debt
that can be quickly reversed at times of financial stress, as
it happened after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September
2008.

 TOKYO, June 22 (Reuters) - Japan set ambitious targets to
rein in its debt on Tuesday but admitted they would not be met
even under its rosiest growth scenario, setting the stage for
politically contentious tax hikes.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan has made fiscal reform a top
priority ahead of a July 11 upper house election, vowing to
consider doubling the 5 percent sales tax, although not for at
least two or three years.
 The government is hoping to keep the support of investors
longer term and avoid a credit ratings downgrade with a credible
fiscal plan.
 ""We must prevent a situation like Greece, where Japan loses
the confidence of bond markets, pushing interest rates higher and
leading its finances into a state of collapse,"" the plan said.
 The plan lacked specific ideas of how to meet its long-term
aim of achieving budget balance targets and reducing its
debt-to-GDP ratio -- now estimated at nearly twice the size of
GDP, the worst in the developed world.
 In the plan, the government pledged to do its utmost to keep
new debt issuance in the year to next March at or below about the
44 trillion yen ($483 billion) that has been earmarked for this
year, while aiming to steadily reduce bond issuance thereafter.
 The plan calls for Japan to bring primary budget balance into
the black within a decade. The balance excludes revenue from bond
sales and debt-servicing costs.
 To achieve this, the government said it will halve Japan's
primary budget deficit -- now estimated at 30.8 trillion yen, or
6.4 percent of GDP -- by the fiscal year from April 2015.
 From fiscal 2021/22 the government will aim to stably lower
the debt-to-GDP ratio.
 But the Cabinet Office estimated that neither the budget
balance nor the debt-GDP ratio goals could be met under the
government's growth strategy, which calls for an average 2
percent real growth by fiscal 2020/21.
 Under the average 2 percent growth scenario, the primary
balance deficit is still estimated at 13.7 trillion yen, or 2.1
percent of GDP in fiscal 2020/21, while the debt-GDP ratio will
exceed 190 percent, with outstanding public debt topping 1,270
trillion yen.
 In the plan, the government also set a cap of around 71
trillion yen on policy-related expenditures, including general
spending and payouts to regional governments, in each of the
three years from fiscal 2011/12.
 The plan said the government will adopt a pay-as-you-go
strategy for fiscal policy to ensure it secures stable revenue
sources in case it implements new policy steps that require more
spending or revenue cuts.
 The timeframe of fiscal targets in the plan may change if an
economic crisis occurs and makes it harder to achieve them, the
plan said.

 TOKYO, June 22 (Reuters) - Japan raised its growth forecast
for the fiscal year to next March to 2.6 percent on the back of a
recovery in the world economy and stimulus steps taken by the
government, the Cabinet Office said on Tuesday.
 That compared with its initial estimate of 1.4 percent growth

to private-sector demand through improvements in company profits,
employment and household incomes.""
 The government also called for continued efforts to beat
deflation as it forecasts overall consumer prices to fall 0.4
percent excluding the effects from the abolishment of public high
school tuition fees in the current fiscal year.
 The BOJ has forecast that core consumer prices would rise
slightly in fiscal 2011/12 in its twice-yearly outlook report,
while forecasting 2.0 percent economic growth for the same year,
quicker than 1.8 percent estimated for this fiscal year.
 The government expects the economy to grow about 2.0
percent and overall consumer prices to reach around zero in
fiscal 2011/12.
 A Reuters poll last week showed the economy's
stronger-than-expected performance in January-March compelled
economists to revise up their growth forecasts for the fiscal
year to next March.
 The world's No.2 economy grew 1.2 percent in January-March
from from the previous quarter, or an annualised 5 percent.

 * Aims to promote more volatile trade
 * China faces scepticism that yuan will be truly flexible
 * AFL-CIO says G20 should address currency manipulation
(Adds oil, stocks, AFL-CIO urging G20 pressure on China)
 By Jason Subler and Lu Jianxin
 SHANGHAI, June 22 (Reuters) - China pulled back the veil on
its new currency regime a little further on Tuesday, appearing
to engineer a fall in the yuan to make clear its vow of
flexibility did not include one-way bets for appreciation.
 Big Chinese state-owned banks kept the yuan in check, a day
after its biggest rise since the currency was revalued in 2005,
and the Foreign Ministry said change would be gradual,
indicating the yuan's appreciation will be far slower than the
pace demanded by critics in the West.
 The two-way movement in the yuan is not great by the
standard of freely floated currencies but is rare in China,
where until this week the central bank had squashed intraday
volatility via intervention on most trading days.
 China started to relax its control over the yuan ahead of
this weekend's G20 summit of world leaders in Canada, easing a
two-year dollar peg that had been a lightning rod for critics
who say the currency is undervalued and gives Chinese exporters
an unfair trade advantage.
 ""China has backed up all the talk with action, and
President Hu (Jintao) will arrive in Toronto later this week
with tangible evidence that China is serious about increasing
the flexibility of its exchange rate,"" said Brian Jackson,
strategist with Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 ""We still may see moves in either direction from day to
day, but we think the trend in the weeks and months ahead will
be for the yuan to make limited but meaningful gains against
the dollar.""
 Under its new freedom, the yuan rose on Monday more than
0.4 percent, the biggest rise in a day since its landmark
revaluation in 2005. It also came close to hitting its trading
limit of 0.5 percent, an amount the currency can move either
side of a reference point set each morning by the central
bank.
 On Tuesday, the yuan fell just over 0.2 percent.
 The fall disappointed many market players, who had
initially thought the central bank's decision to set the
reference rate in line with Monday's close was a sign that it
was willing to let the currency strengthen further.
 Crude oil fell below $78 per barrel on Tuesday on
expectations that a slow rise in China's currency would have a
more limited impact on global demand than initially
anticipated.
 ""The knee-jerk positive reaction and euphoria related to
the yuan news were definitely overdone. So, it's logical to see
the markets giving up the gains from yesterday,"" said Eugen
Weinberg, head of commodity research at Commerzbank.
 Stock markets slipped in Asia and Europe with traders
saying optimism over China's move had dissipated and as equity
investors took profits from multi-week highs.
 China's state-owned banks stepped in to the market by
mid-morning and aggressively bought dollars, traders said,
suggesting authorities want to control the pace of the yuan's
appreciation.
 The People's Bank of China, the central bank, made no
secret that it would not allow the yuan to appreciate too fast
when it announced the currency reform at the weekend.
 CALLS FOR MORE PRESSURE
 China's critics in the United States -- who demand
appreciation and lower Chinese trade surpluses -- have already
begun to call for renewed pressure on Beijing.
 ""We strongly urge further effort by both the U.S. and other
G20 governments until China takes specific steps on a scale
that addresses the scale of the imbalance,"" AFL-CIO President
Richard Trumka said in a statement.
 The head of the largest U.S. federation of labor unions
said G20 leaders should raise currency manipulation this week
in Toronto and called on the U.S. Congress to ""act on currency
legislation without further delay.""
 By allowing for greater ups and downs day to day, China's
central bank will move a step closer to its long-stated aim of
developing a more mature market in which companies learn to
hedge against foreign exchange risks, part of China's overall
efforts to develop Shanghai into a global financial centre by
2020.
 The central bank signalled another step on the way to
ultimately allowing the yuan to become fully convertible on
Tuesday, confirming it would expand a pilot programme under
which companies can invoice and pay for imports and exports in
yuan.
 Still, markets and critics in the United States and other
countries are unlikely to be easily convinced of the depth of
the currency reforms unless they see a significant rise in the
yuan.
 Markets surged on Monday after Beijing's weekend vow, on
optimism a stronger currency would boost the fast-growing
economy's purchasing power.
 But doubts about the speed of yuan appreciation had already
begun to surface in the United States on Monday. Asian stocks
then reversed their gains on Tuesday as investors took profits
from Monday's rally.
 Commodities also pared their gains, as did commodity-linked
currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars.
 HOW FLEXIBLE?
 Many economists see China's currency strengthening further
in coming days but at a very modest pace, further diluting
hopes for big market gains.
 A Reuters poll of 33 economists forecast the yuan would
rise to 6.67 per dollar by the end the year, an increase of 2.4
percent from late last week before China's policy announcement
and similar to the appreciation implied by offshore
non-deliverable forwards.
 The central bank is likely using a basket of currencies as
a reference for the exchange rate, meaning that if other
currencies such as the euro start to strengthen again, the yuan
could rise against the dollar with them, said Ha Jiming, chief
economist for China International Capital Corp in Beijing.
 ""There's an automatic adjustment mechanism embedded in this
policy,"" Ha told Reuters Insider TV.
 ""By using a basket of currencies as a reference, it means
that when the dollar appreciates against the euro, the RMB
could appreciate against the euro as well but may not
necessarily appreciate against the dollar. And the opposite is
true.""
 Even with such increased movement expected in the long run,
the challenge for China going into this weekend's G20 summit
will be to convince other countries that it has made a genuine
move to a more flexible currency.
 The United States and G20 host Canada gave China's move
positive reviews on Monday, while saying that significance of
the policy change depends on how it is implemented.

 * Euro retreats to $1.23, vulnerable if yuan does not rise
 * Dollar index posts bullish reversal, more gains seen
 * 
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 22 (Reuters) - The euro was subdued on Tuesday
as investors anxiously waited to see how far and fast the Chinese
authorities would let their currency rise amid speculation any
appreciation would be slow at best.
 All eyes are on the yuan's mid-point fixing at 0115 GMT to
see whether the People's Bank of China would let it appreciate
from Monday's steady 6.8275 per dollar.
 The market took the yuan 0.42 percent higher on Monday, its
biggest one-day rise since the 2005 revaluation. But dealers fear
the central bank will not go nearly as far with the fixing rate,
which would likely weigh on the euro and commodity currencies.
 Doubts had already emerged overnight and erased most of the
euro's initial rally. On Tuesday, the euro  was at $1.2315,
having fallen from a one-month high of $1.2490.
 Near term support was seen at $1.2253, the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the rise from a 4-year low of $1.1875 on
June 7 to Monday's high of $1.2490.
 On the other hand, the dollar index <.DXY> was up at 85.94,
holding well above support at 85.13. The index posted a bullish
reversal day on Monday, suggesting more gains for the greenback
in the near term.
 Beijing's vow of flexibility on the yuan, which should boost
purchasing power and demand in the the world's third largest
economy, had initially fuelled a rally in risky assets on Monday.
 But the rally ebbed with not much follow-through buying, with
China's move undertaken primarily for political purposes,
analysts said. Leaders of the Group of 20 leading industrialized
and developing economies are to meet next week in Toronto, where
global trade imbalances are expected to be a key issue.
 China on Monday ruled out a one-off revaluation and said it
will reform its exchange rate regime in a gradual manner.
[ID:nBJC002566].
""The Chinese decision provided a welcoming short-term
distraction in a market gripped by fear and anxiety, but the
underlying European fiscal headaches and global growth
uncertainties remain unaltered,"" wrote Matthew Strauss, currency

RBC's Strauss added the euro's failure to break past
resistance near $1.25 was likely to result in a period for
weakness for the single currency. Against the yen, the euro was
steady at 112.20, having shed about 0.2 percent on Monday.
 The euro in recent months has moved with swings in risk
appetite. On Monday, the 25-day rolling correlation between the
euro and the S&P 500 <.SPX> was at a robust 54 percent.
 The fading risk rally was also evident in stock markets.
 The New Zealand  and Australian dollars ,
were off five-week highs.
 The Aussie , which had gained 1.4 percent in the
previous session, was at $0.8776, with support at $0.8750 --

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 21 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar tumbled
from a five-week high against the U.S. currency to end lower on
Monday as market enthusiasm for China's plans to allow its
currency more flexibility gave way to concerns about fiscal
discipline.
 China's weekend announcement that it will let the yuan rise
was seen as a signal of confidence in its economy, boosting
equity markets worldwide, as well as commodity prices.
 The rise in risk sentiment helped the Canadian dollar climb
to C$1.0138 to the U.S. dollar, or 98.64 U.S. cents, its
highest level since May 13.
 But it lost about a penny from its intraday high to end the
session at C$1.0244 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.62 U.S. cents,
down from Friday's close at C$1.0212 to the U.S. dollar, or
97.92 U.S. cents.
 ""Ultimately, the optimism was short-lived and throughout
the North American trading session it quickly faded ... turning
into mild risk aversion,"" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""The market focus is quickly returning to the broader
issues of fiscal discipline,"" he said, adding that markets will
be monitoring Britain's emergency budget, due Tuesday.
 Britain is expected to announce the tightest budget in at
least 30 years to cut a record deficit of around 11 percent of
GDP, the latest country that will have to present austere
measures to deal with its debt. [ID:nLDE65G22W]
 The focus on fiscal consolidation was underscored by the
Bank of Canada, which said in its twice-yearly Financial System
Review that overall risk to the stability of Canada's financial
system has increased over the past six months. The central bank
warned that the financial system will be vulnerable unless
rising government debt levels are dealt with. [ID:nN21243332]
 The Canadian currency also lost some steam after Finance
Minister Jim Flaherty said the Group of 20 nations will want
more details on the yuan plan. In addition, Prime Minister
Stephen Harper said he was encouraged by China's decision but
wanted to see the results. [ID:nN21249551] [ID:nNYC003401]
 China's central bank has maintained the yuan's peg to the
U.S. dollar since the middle of 2008, a controversial policy
aimed at steadying the world's fastest growing major economy
during the global economic downturn. [ID:nN20208975]
[ID:nN21251910]
 ""It's backed off of its highs because of comments that were
attributed to the finance minister and the prime minister, as
well as the Bank of Canada's financial review,"" said Jack
Spitz, managing director of foreign exchange at National Bank
Financial.
 BONDS SLIP AS STOCKS HOLD GAINS
 Canadian government bond prices were flat to lower across
the curve, as China's yuan move spurred thin gains in equity
markets.
 Markets could be in for a volatile period as the G20 summit
arrives in Toronto at the end of the week, and ahead of other
key economic data on Tuesday.
 Canadian data on tap includes inflation figures for May, as
well as retail sales for April.
 As well, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to reiterate
its commitment to keeping interest rates ""exceptionally low""
for an ""extended period"" when it sets interest rates on
Tuesday. [ID:nN18127782] [ID:nN17269337]
 The two-year government bond  was unchanged to
yield 1.739 percent, while the 10-year bond  was off
4 Canadian cents to yield 3.327 percent.
 Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. Treasury issues across the
curve. The Canadian 10-year bond yield was 7.9 basis points
above its U.S. counterpart, compared with 9.7 basis points on
Friday.

 * As with Iran, sees sanctions as counter-productive
 * Sees possible role in nuclear, security dialogue
 By Bruno Marfinati
 SAO PAULO, June 21 (Reuters) - Brazil aims to broaden its
dialogue with communist North Korea to include discussion of
the Asian nation's nuclear weapons program and security on the
Korean peninsula, its ambassador in Pyongyang said.
 The Latin American giant has been rapidly spreading its
diplomatic ties under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,
including to countries that have been isolated because of
security or human rights issues.
 Lula has overseen a warming of ties with Iran and launched
a failed diplomatic push to avert new U.N. sanctions because of
Tehran's nuclear program, which drew a skeptical response from
the United States.
 As with Iran, Brazil views sanctions against North Korea as
counterproductive and sees room for more dialogue, Ambassador
Arnaldo Carrilho told Reuters by telephone from Pyongyang on
Saturday.
 ""Brazil's central objective is the opening of dialogue in
all senses, including about the nuclear question and the
permanent war footing of the People's Army,"" said Carrilho, who
began his posting with the opening of Brazil's first embassy in
North Korea last year.
 ""There is still a lot to do and the destiny of Brazil is
not small,"" he said.
 While Brazil would look for ways to play a role as a
mediator in Korean security issues, Carrilho said there was
currently no opportunity to do so.
 The opening of Brazil's embassy last July came despite the
reclusive North Korea's testing of a nuclear weapon and
test-firing of ballistic missiles that prompted renewed
international efforts to tighten financial sanctions. The U.S.
administration is now considering fresh financial action to
punish Pyongyang over the sinking of a South Korean warship,
sources told Reuters last week.
 Carrilho said business accords were being discussed with
North Korea that included major Brazilian food firms JBS,
Brasil Foods and its state agricultural research agency
Embrapa. He did not give details on the possible deals.
 Bilateral trade between the distant countries reached $215
million in 2009, according to the Brazilian government, which
puts Brazil among North Korea's major trade partners after
China.
 Carrilho also said Brazil is preparing to donate 100,000
tonnes of food to North Korea, including soy, rice, sugar, and
powdered milk.
 FOOD DONATION
 The 71-year-old veteran diplomat said Brazil, which holds a
revolving seat on the U.N. Security Council, was opposed to new
sanctions against North Korea, saying they would only make life
harder for people there and would not resolve social or
security problems.
 In line with Brazil's reluctance under Lula to criticize
human rights problems or a lack of democracy in other
countries, Carrilho said North Korea's one-party system should
not get in the way of warmer two-way ties.
 ""I would never propose a similar regime for Brazil and I
don't believe they would want to copy ours,"" he said. ""You have
to respect the cultural and historical circumstances of people
if you want your own to be respected.""
 While Brazil would look for ways to play a role as a
mediator in Korean security issues, he said there was currently
no opportunity to do so.
 Carrilho, a movie buff, aims to expand cultural ties
between samba- and football-loving Brazil and the
strait-jacketed North Korean society, starting by showing
Brazilian films at a Pyongyang film festival.
 Last week's World Cup game in which Brazil beat North
Korea, 2-1, was a good start, he said.
 ""Good diplomacy is always about finding meeting points. The
game without doubt played a bonding role between the people of
both countries,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the
U.S. dollar on Monday, while the Australian and New Zealand
units pared gains, as yuan-induced euphoria faded amid doubts
over the overall impact of China's pledge for a more flexible
currency.
 Beijing's announcement over the weekend, which should boost
purchasing power and demand in the the world's third largest
economy, initially fueled a market rally worldwide. The
currency move was seen helping global companies that sell to
China and underpinning commodity-linked currencies such as the
Australian dollar.
 But the rally ebbed with no follow-through buying, analysts

undertaken primarily for political purposes.
 China on Monday ruled out a one-off revaluation and said it

chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New

 Leaders of the Group of 20 leading industrialized and

global trade imbalances are expected to be a key issue.
 EURO FAILS TO GET ABOVE $1.2350
 In late New York trading, the euro fell 0.6 percent against
the dollar to $1.2313, after earlier trading to a one-month
high at $1.2490, according to electronic trading platform EBS.
Traders sold the euro after it failed to get above $1.2350.
 The single currency in recent months has moved with swings
in risk appetite. On Monday, the 25-day rolling correlation
between the euro and the S&P 500 was still at a robust 54
percent.
 ""The breakdown now leaves a potential key reversal pattern
unfolding. A close below ($1.2354) would signal an immediate
test on the $1.2290 and possibly as low as $1.2200,"" said Marc
Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York.
 The high-yielding Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to
US$0.8762, off an earlier one-month peak at US$0.8860.
 One-month AUD/USD risk reversals, a measure of currency
sentiment in the options market, were still showing a bias for
puts -- suggesting expectation of further declines -- at -4.20
vols on Monday, from -4.425 last Friday. But Aussie risk
reversals have come off extreme levels.
 Two weeks ago, the put bias on the Aussie traded as high
-5.875 vols, pressured by the negative global risk appetite
arising from the euro zone debt crisis.
 The New Zealand dollar rose 0.2 percent to US$0.7081 after
an earlier high at US$0.7153, its strongest level since May
14.
 Earlier in the session, the Chinese yuan closed at 6.7976
against the U.S. dollar, the highest closing level against the
greenback since the yuan's July 2005 revaluation and up 0.42
percent from Friday's close of 6.8262. It hit an all-time
intraday high since the revaluation of 6.7958, up as much as
0.47 percent from the central bank's mid-point, nearing its
limit of 0.5 percent.
 The U.S. dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen to 90.99,
boosted by steep gains in the Australian dollar/yen cross and
New Zealand dollar/yen pair.

 * Bill also includes sanctions on Iran's gas suppliers
 * Waiver possible for companies from some countries
 (Adds White House comment, paragraphs 5,6)
 By Susan Cornwell
 WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - Iran's financial partners
would be hit with new unilateral sanctions under draft
legislation proposed by U.S. House of Representatives and
Senate negotiators, lawmakers announced on Monday in a move
aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program.
 The legislation would effectively deprive foreign banks of
access to the U.S. financial system if they do business with
key Iranian banks or its Revolutionary Guard Corps.
 The proposal, which also includes sanctions on Iran's
gasoline suppliers, was announced in a joint statement by
Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Howard Berman, both
Democrats. It is being circulated among House and Senate
negotiators and will have to pass both chambers to become law.
 Key lawmakers want Congress to pass the bill by early next
month to tighten existing U.S. sanctions on Iran and build on
sanctions agreed by the U.N. Security Council and European
Union.
 White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the Obama
administration appreciates that House and Senate leaders have
forged a ""strong bill"" that builds on the U.N. sanctions.
 ""We will continue to work with the Congress over the coming
days as it finalizes work on this important bill, and in our
ongoing efforts to hold Iran accountable,"" Gibbs said in a
statement.
 There is bipartisan support for the goal of pressuring Iran
to stop its nuclear work, which Washington suspects is aimed at
bomb-making. But some Republicans thought the draft looked
weaker than they had hoped, a Republican aide said.
 ""The act presents foreign banks doing business with
blacklisted Iranian entities a stark choice -- cease your
activities or be denied critical access to America's financial
system,"" according to a summary of the proposed legislation.
 The act will also hold U.S. banks accountable for actions
by their foreign subsidiaries, the summary said.
 A QUESTION OF ENFORCEMENT
 U.S. companies are already prohibited from doing business
with Iran. Foreign companies with big investments in Iran's
energy sector also can be sanctioned under current U.S. law.
 But many U.S. lawmakers charge this has not been enforced,
with presidents of both parties reluctant to sanction companies
hailing from trading partners and allies.
 The new proposal includes a provision that would allow the
president to waive for a year sanctions on companies from
countries that cooperate with multilateral efforts to keep Iran
from getting nuclear weapons.
 A congressional aide said President Barack Obama's
administration had wanted upfront exemptions for the
""cooperating"" countries, but lawmakers insisted on allowing
only temporary, case-by-case waivers on companies from those
countries.
 A number of companies worldwide, such as Italy's oil and
gas company Eni and French energy giant Total have been backing
away from business with Iran amid the U.S. drive to isolate
Iran, and U.S. lawmakers hope to deter more.
 Suppliers of gasoline to Iran could face a variety of
sanctions under the draft bill, including prohibitions on
access to the U.S. banking system, property transactions and
foreign exchange in the United States.
 Iran depends on gasoline imports because it has
insufficient refining capacity. Many U.S. lawmakers say cutting
off the gasoline supply would be the best way to pressure the
regime into giving up its nuclear program. Iran says the
program is for peaceful purposes.
 The draft legislation also would impose ""significant
financial penalties and travel restrictions"" on abusers of
human rights in Iran, the summary said. They could be banned
from getting U.S. visas or have U.S. financial assets frozen.

 NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained
against the yen as the Australian and New Zealand currencies
hit over one month highs on Monday after China's vow to allow a
flexible yuan rekindled optimism about global recovery.
 Beijing's announcement over the weekend should boost
purchasing power and demand in the the world's third largest

China and underpin commodity-tied currencies such as the
Australian dollar.
 ""China's move has unleashed improved confidence and higher

 ""Commodity currencies such as the Aussie and Kiwi will
always be the biggest beneficiaries on the ground that yuan
strength raises China's purchasing power. If the Aussie is

 The Chinese currency closed at its highest level against
the U.S. dollar since its July 2005 revaluation. The yuan ended
the day at 6.7976 against the dollar, up 0.42 percent from

 The New Zealand dollar  rose 0.2 percent to
US$0.7081 after an earlier high at US$0.7153, its strongest
level since May 14.
 The U.S. dollar rose 0.4 percent against the yen  to
90.99, boosted by steep gains in the Australian dollar/yen
cross  and New Zealand dollar/yen pair .
 Some analysts, however, believe the impact on the market of
of the latest news from China could be short-lived.
 ""China has an incentive to frontload moves before the G20
meeting and the U.S. currency report so we could see a
continuation of these moves through most of this week and
possibly into next,"" said Steven Englander, Citigroup's global
head of currency strategy. ""But the incentive for China to make
currency moves after the currency report is released
diminishes.""

after earlier trading to a one-month high $1.2490, according to
electronic trading platform EBS.
 Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown

euro to news ratings agency Fitch cut BNP Paribas' long-term
international rating to AA- from AA. See [ID:nN21250262].
 ""The break down (in the euro) now leaves a potential key

 * Says euro/dollar moves do not reflect fundamental data
 
 (Adds detail)
 BRUSSELS, June 21 (Reuters) - The results of European Union
stress tests on banks need to be published, but carrying out the
tests only on major banks may not be sufficient to calm markets,
European Central Bank Governing Council member Yves Mersch said.
 ""I support the publishing of the data. But it is
questionable whether only looking at the 25 to 30 biggest banks
of the EU -- none of which is Luxembourgish -- is sufficient to
get a clear view,"" Mersch said in an interview with the
Luxembourg daily Wort to be published on Tuesday.
 Mersch said the stress tests should not just be carried out
on bigger banks which operate across borders, but that tests
should also be carried out on banks which are only active in one
country.
 ""If the results (of such tests) are comforting, that would
contribute to a calming of the markets,"" he said.
 Mersch said countries that broke the EU's budget rules had
to be punished.
 Asked what such a punishment might entail, Mersch, who is
also governor of Luxembourg's central bank, said there was a
need to ratify a new stability and growth pact with automatic
sanctions.
 The euro-dollar currency movements did not reflect
fundamental data, Mersch said.
 ""The euro is the only currency worldwide that since its
introduction has best supported people's purchasing power,"" he
said.
 Mersch also said the European Central Bank could not take on
the role of a rating agency.

 * Sees 2010 rev growth below 20 pct, aims for higher margins
 * Plans 7 store openings, including in New York and Tokyo
 
 By Antonella Ciancio
 MILAN, June 21 (Reuters) - Italian high-end sportswear maker
Moncler is cautious on whether to go ahead with its 2011 planned
listing due to market uncertainty, as revenue growth will likely
slow after a 23 percent rise last year, its chairman said.
 The rooster-logoed brand, synonymous with coloured down
jackets, has hired Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch as global
coordinators for the initial public offering.
 ""The project is concrete. We named the advisors,"" Chairman
Remo Ruffini told Reuters in an interview at Moncler's show
during Milan's spring-summer 2011 menswear fashion week.
 ""But markets are very difficult, we need to be cautious.
Let's see if we will do (the IPO) or not,"" said Ruffini, who is
the company's second-biggest investor.
 Private equity firm Carlyle, which has a 48 percent stake,
said in June it was considering floating Moncler between spring
and summer of 2011.
 After Italian online fashion retailer Yoox floated on the
Milan bourse in December, analysts wondered whether the IPO
market could re-open to luxury groups like Prada and Ferragamo,
which have been waiting for over a year.
 The two fashion houses have said they never abandoned their
listing plans but are waiting for markets to stabilise.
 
 EYES HIGHER MARGINS
 Moncler, which owns brands such as Marina Yachting and HenrY
Cotton's, reported a 23 percent revenue increase to 372 million
euros ($461 million) in 2009. Sales grew 7.9 percent to 125.5
million euros in the first quarter of 2010.
 ""We expect (revenue) growth to be below 20 percent this
year, almost in line with 2009, but we aim to increase margins"",
Ruffini said.
 Ruffini, a businessman and keen sportsman who took over the
French company in 2003, owns a 38 percent stake in the group,
where he is also creative director.
 Founded in 1952 by a French mountain gear manufacturer,
Moncler equipment was once sold in exclusive mountain resorts
before opening stores in the biggest fashion capitals.
 The group, which owns 18 mono-brand stores and four
shop-in-shops, will open seven stores in coming months,
including in New York, Tokyo and Beijing.
 Japan is the company's second-biggest market after Europe.

 * Yuan hits 5-year high as China allows more flexibility
 * Commodities up on hopes for increased demand
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - World stocks surged to a
five-week high and oil and other commodities jumped on Monday
after China vowed to allow its exchange rate to become more
flexible, boosting confidence in the global economic recovery.
 Spot yuan  climbed to its highest level against
the dollar since its last revaluation in July 2005 in a clear
signal that Beijing was sticking to its word that it would
allow greater currency flexibility. [nN20208975]
 The move spurred optimism that a stronger yuan would lift
China's purchasing power for foreign goods such as commodities,
a boon to the global economy given China's huge demand for raw
materials.
 The Australian and New Zealand dollars, considered part of
the commodity bloc, rose to their highest levels in about a
month, and copper and energy prices surged on expectations of
increased appetite for natural resources in the world's
third-largest economy.
 The ease on the currency peg is a move to allow China's
economy to be driven less by the export of goods abroad and
more by domestic consumer spending. The move came ahead of a
meeting next week of the Group of 20 leading industrialized and
developing economies, where global trade imbalances are
expected to be a key issue.
 The surge in global equities on Monday was led by energy
and materials shares, which rose with the higher commodities
prices.
 ""It is a powerful story for equity markets,"" said Mike
Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin.
 ""China's readiness for further exchange rate reform is just
what is needed. Together with interest rates on hold at the
major central banks, it provides another means of reflation for
the global economy.""
 U.S. stocks were propelled on by the long-term outlook for
sales at U.S. multinationals, as well as by gains in natural
resource shares.
 ""Companies that produce durable goods like Caterpillar will
benefit from this,"" said Randy Frederic, director of trading
and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research in
Austin, Texas.
 ""The assumption is that the yuan maintains its increased
valuation (against) the dollar in the long-term, so Chinese
people will have the ability to purchase U.S. market goods.""

 China's decision to allow the yuan to strengthen would

[ID:nN20208975]
 Growing consumer demand in China has helped to drive
exports of raw materials from the region, such as Brazil's iron
ore and soy beans, Mexico's oil and Chile's copper.
 ""It is cheaper for the Chinese to buy all these commodities
and that is helping the Latin American region in general,"" said
Gerardo Margolis, vice president of emerging markets at TD

 But he warned the optimism over China might not have a
long-lasting effect on the currency markets since the policy
shift had been expected for years.
 The bid quote for the Brazilian real  was 0.5 percent
stronger at 1.761 reais per dollar on the local spot market in

 Mexican and Chilean currencies also firmed. The Mexican

 Colombia's currency was also boosted after Juan Manuel

 However, yields were later slightly lower.

 NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - The Australian and New
Zealand dollars rose to their highest levels in about a month
on Monday after China let the yuan rise to a five-year high,
raising optimism about global economic recovery.
China's vow to allow a flexible yuan is expected to boost
its buying power abroad. Given China's huge demand for raw
materials, the move was seen spurring a rise in demand for
commodities and gave a boost to commodity-linked currencies
such as the Australian dollar.
 Spot yuan rose to its highest level since its revaluation
five years ago, bolstering hopes the flexibility pledge from
China over the weekend would begin to reduce global imbalances
and ease tensions in the Group of 20 leading economies ahead of
a meeting next week.
 The single European currency initially extended last week's
recovery against the dollar, at one point rising to a one-month
high, though gains faded as the New York session got underway.
 The dollar slipped versus a basket of currencies to a
one-month low largely because of the euro's rise.
 ""Until we know more from China, how much (they will allow
the yuan to appreciate) and in what time frame, we probably
won't be seeing much reaction in the major crosses,"" said Dan
Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago. This is
definitely ahead of the G20 to get them off the hook.""
 Midway through the New York session, the higher-yielding
Australian dollar gained 1 percent to $0.8807, off an earlier
one-month peak. The New Zealand dollar rose 0.8 percent to
$0.7117, after an earlier five-week high.
 A higher yuan would help temper inflation in China by
pushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijing
would have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively.
 Markets have been worried China could over-tighten and slow
its economy too far which had raised concerns about Beijing's
demand for natural resources, which would impact currencies
which are part of the commodity bloc.
 But some analysts were cautioning how long the latest news
from China will impact markets.
 ""China has an incentive to frontload moves before the G20
meeting and the U.S. currency report, so we could see a
continuation of these moves through most of this week and
possibly into next,"" said Steven Englander, Citigroup's global
head of currency strategy. ""But the incentives for China to
make currency moves after the currency report is released
diminishes.""
 Wells Fargo is forecasting a 4-1/2 percent gain in the yuan
over the next year, compared to the 2-1/2 percent rise
currently priced into the non-deliverable forward
marketsession. It was last down 0.1 percent at $1.2374 after
earlier having rallied to its highest level since May 24 on
trading platform EBS.
 European Central Bank governing council member Christian
Noyer said on Monday some banks were facing funding problems,
as banks continue to deposit cash at the ECB as a result of
current market uncertainty..
 Traders said option barriers at $1.2500 were reportedly
being protected by a major Asian sovereign account, which had
prevented further gains overnight.
 The euro rose against the low-yielding yen, gaining 0.4
percent to 112.82 yen. The dollar was up 0.5 percent versus the
yen at 91.16 yen.
 The euro closed on Friday with its best weekly gain since
May 2009 after a successful Spanish bond auction eased concerns
over the health of Spain's public finances.
 The euro's recovery, however, is still uncertain.
 ""The euro main focus is still the sovereign debt,"" said IG
Markets' Cook. ""There are a lot of questions about the euro in
general and as long as it remains quiet, it will remain at
these levels.""

 FRANKFURT, June 21 (Reuters) - German sporting goods maker
Adidas lifted its 2010 revenue outlook for soccer-related
products to at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) on Monday,
boosted by the World Cup in South Africa.
 Adidas, the industry's No. 2 behind U.S. group Nike,
provides World Cup match balls, dresses tournament officials
such as referees, and equips 12 teams, including host nation
South Africa, Greece and European champion Spain.
 It had previously expected soccer-related sales of at least
1.3 billion euros.
 At 1350 GMT, Adidas shares were 0.3 percent higher.
 Chief executive Herbert Hainer said the company's Reebok
brand had also been performing above expectations and the
revaluation of China's yuan would have an overall positive
effect for Adidas.
 In May, Adidas hiked its outlook, mirroring a move by rival

 NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - The Australian and New
Zealand dollars rose to their highest levels in about a month
on Monday after China let the yuan rise to a five-year high,
raising optimism about the global economic recovery as the move
boosts China's buying power abroad.
 Given China's huge demand for raw materials, the move is
seen as spurring a worldwide rise in commodity and oil prices.
 Spot yuan rose to its highest level since its revaluation
five years ago, bolstering hopes that a pledge from China over
the weekend on yuan flexibility would begin to reduce global
imbalances and ease tensions in the Group of 20 leading
economies ahead of a meeting next week. [ID:nBJD003795]
 The single European currency initially extended last week's
recovery against the dollar, at one point rising to a one-month
high, though gains faded as the New York session got underway.
 ""As the main reserve currency, the U.S. dollar will be
viewed as the big loser of a managed yuan appreciation,"" said
TJ Marta, chief market strategist at Marta on the Markets.
""Losses will likely be mostly against currencies that stand to
benefit from increased strength of the yuan: the Australian
dollar and New Zealand dollar.""
 In early New York trade, the higher-yielding Australian
dollar  gained 1.2 percent to around $0.8828, off an
earlier one-month peak. 
 The New Zealand dollar  rose 1 percent to $0.7137,
after having earlier climbed to a five-week high.
 A higher yuan would help temper inflation in China by
pushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijing
would have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively.
 Markets have been worried China could over-tighten and slow
its economy too far which had raised concerns about Beijing's
demand for natural resources, which would impact
commodity-linked currencies including the Australian dollar.
 But some analysts were cautioning how long the latest news
from China will impact markets.
 ""China has an incentive to frontload moves before the G20
meeting and the U.S. currency report, so we could see a
continuation of these moves through most of this week and
possibly into next, but the incentives for China to make
currency moves after the currency report is released
diminishes,"" said Steven Englander, Citigroup's global head of
currency strategy.

 (Adds Simor comments, detail, analyst)
 By Gergely Szakacs and Marton Dunai
 BUDAPEST, June 21 (Reuters) - Hungary's central bank kept
interest rates  on hold as expected at 5.25 percent
 on Monday and gave no signals about the possibility
of further rate cuts while urging tight fiscal policy.
 Governor Andras Simor warned that a government economic plan
announced earlier this month had ""very significant""
implementation risks and a planned bank tax would sharply cut
the financial sector's profitability.
 Simor, who has been under attack from the new centre-right
government since April elections, also said a plan to cut
central bankers' salaries would hurt the bank's independence and
that the cabinet had no right to change salaries.
""My oath obliges me to lead the central bank and defend its
independence. A cornerstone of this independence is that the
central bank picks its staff and decides about their
compensation,"" Simor said in a statement.
 ""The financial independence of the central bank is a main
pillar of central bank independence.""
 Monday's rate-setting meeting was the first since a plunge
by the forint  and government bonds in early June on
comments by government officials comparing Hungary's situation
to that of debt-ridden Greece.
 Markets have only partially recovered from those falls.
 Simor said keeping rates on hold had an overwhelming
majority on the Council, which also dropped a usual reference to
the possibility of rate cuts from its rate decision statement.
 ""Dropping the reference to future rate cuts can mean that
interest rates can stay on hold for longer time now, that is for
months,"" said Gergely Szabo Forian of Pioneer Fund Management.
 ""My reading is that rate cuts have been taken down from the
agenda for now. This does not mean that the easing cycle has
ended.""
 Before Monday's meeting analysts expected the base rate to
be lowered by another quarter-point this year.
 
 DEFENDING INDEPENDENCE
 The bank's decision was in line with the expectations of all
25 analysts in a Reuters poll last week . It had
reduced its key rate in 10 steps between July 2009 and April
2010, by a combined 425 basis points, but left them on hold in
May citing risks to inflation and from global markets.
 ""The Council does not want to give any kind of signal as to
the rate trajectory for the next months,"" Simor said.
 The decision to hold rates had no significant impact on the
forint and government bonds.
 Elsewhere in the region, the Czech Republic and Poland are
both thought to be done cutting rates, while Romania may
continue to do so.
 The NBH said in current global market conditions it was
particularly important to maintain disciplined fiscal policy
that was sustainable in the long term and said details of the
government's plan to meet the 2010 budget deficit target needed
to be worked out swiftly.
 Hungary's government last week pledged to meet the deficit
target and announced spending cuts and a big bank tax to raise
revenues, after the concerns over its debt position had given
Hungarian markets a renewed hammering.
 As part of this package, the cabinet said it would limit
public sector salaries and cut central bankers' pay, seen by
analysts as the latest attack on the central bank.
 The government has stepped up pressure on Simor to resign in
the past two months, criticising him over his private
investments, and what officials said were serious policy errors.
 Simor has said he would fill his mandate, which runs to
2013.
 ""Leaders of the central bank cannot be bribed with higher
pay equally as they cannot be punished with lower pay. This
personal independence is the other pillar of central bank
independence,"" he said on Monday.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2010 08:26AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Germany welcomes Chinese move on yuan flexibility," (Adds Bruederle, quotes on G20)
 BERLIN, Jun 21 (Reuters) - Germany welcomed China's pledge
to make the yuan currency more flexible on Monday, saying the
move could help to address global economic imbalances.
 ""We welcome the announcement that there will be greater
flexibility in the yuan,"" Finance Ministry spokesman Michael
Offer told a regular news conference, adding it remained to be
seen what the timeframe for the changes would be.
 German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said the news was a
good sign and could help redress global imbalances.
 China's surprise weekend announcement comes ahead of this
week's G20 summit in Canada where leaders will discuss trade
imbalances and how to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.
 The leaders may find it tough to bridge a gap between the
United States, keen to keep economic growth on track, and
European states, some of whom see cutting budget deficits as
their top priority.
 In particular, there is a transatlantic rift on how quickly
to withdraw stimulus measures introduced to offset the effects
of global recession in 2008. Shaken by a debt crisis in the euro
zone, Germany has pushed hard for fiscal discipline.
 U.S. President Barack Obama has appealed to surplus nations
to boost domestic demand. Obama has said public finance problems
should be addressed in the medium term, effectively arguing that
policymakers should not emphasise fiscal discipline at the
expense of economic recovery.
 A German government spokesman said Berlin was balancing
policies to boost growth and cut the ballooning deficit.
 Two weeks ago, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced an 80
billion euro austerity drive.
 ""It is important for this government that on the one hand we
have policies geared to growth and the labour market and on the
other hand we take care of our duties on consolidation,"" the
spokesman said.
 ""We want as much agreement as possible, firstly on an
EU-level, but also on a G20 level, on an exit strategy from the
financing (provided) during the crisis ... there will of course
be the need for discussion at the G20 talks,"" he added.

 * EU is one of most active protectionists, GTA says
 * G20 shd target jumbo measures covering $1.6 trln in trade
 
 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 21 (Reuters) - Major trading powers are
continuing to impose protectionist measures in defiance of a
promise by G20 leaders to keep markets open, according to a
report by independent economists.
 The report, by Global Trade Alert (GTA), to be issued later
this week to coincide with the G20 summit in Toronto, finds that
such policies in 2009 turned out much worse than was known at
the time of the Pittsburgh summit last September.
 ""The costs of the ineffectual G20 pledges mount quarter by
quarter,"" Simon Evenett, an economics professor at St. Gallen
University in Switzerland and coordinator of GTA, said.
 The report finds that nearly 650 protectionist measures
implemented since the first crisis-related G20 summit in
November 2008, when leaders promised to avoid protectionism,
remain in place.
 The findings of GTA, which has consistently warned that
protectionism is running at a far higher level than governments
acknowledge, are not shared by all economists.
 The World Trade Organization (WTO), for example, says that
the rules-based global trading system, and memories of the 1930s
Great Depression that was partly triggered by
beggar-thy-neighbour policies, have kept protectionism in check.
 In its own report issued last week for the G20 summit, the
WTO said governments had largely resisted resorting to trade
barriers.
 It said the number of new trade measures was falling, with
new measures since November 2009 covering only 0.4 percent of
global imports -- with a smaller reduction in trade of those
goods. From October 2008 to October 2009, trade measures covered
1 percent of imports.
 GTA on the other hand says this understates the problem.
 ""The contribution of the WTO has been overstated; its
agreements have channelled protectionist pressures into policies
not well covered by enforceable rules,"" Evenett said.
 Ranked by measures such as the number of actions taken, and
the number of products, sectors and trading partners affected,
Global Trade Alert found that the European Union was one of the
most active protectionists.
 Russia, Argentina and Nigeria also feature high in its
lists. China, followed by the EU and United States, was the main
target.
 The report identifies 22 far-reaching ""jumbo"" actions
hurting more than 15 G20 trading partners and affecting more
than $10 billion in trade, that should be a starting point for
any G20 exit strategy on trade.
 ""Few of these jumbo measures are policies for which there
are strong WTO rules,"" Evenett said.
 The policies, covering $1.6 trillion or more than 10 percent
of world imports, include measures such as China's export tax
rebates and U.S. ""Buy American"" provisions in its stimulus
package.

surge
 * PBOC silence suggests it wants more market-driven trade

 By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, June 21 (Reuters) - China's yuan soared on Monday
to its highest against the dollar since the landmark 2005
revaluation, with the central bank stepping aside and
tolerating broad gains on the first trading day since scrapping
the currency's two-year peg to the dollar.
 The central bank declined to intervene, one of the few
times in the yuan's modern history that is has stepped aside,
and appeared to want the market to drive intraday trade,
backing up its weekend pledge to allow greater flexibility.
 Traders said it was unlikely the yuan would repeat gains on
the same scale in coming days, with Tuesday's mid-point setting
serving as an important barometer of how much more appreciation
the People's Bank of China is willing to stomach.
 ""You cannot expect the yuan to shoot up 5 percent in two or
three weeks, as the pace of Monday's rise implies,"" said a
dealer at a North American bank in Shanghai.
 Several dealers said they expected the PBOC to keep the
mid-point unchanged on Tuesday, or even push it up as much as
50 pips, to effectively cap how much the yuan could rise.
 The yuan is allowed to rise or fall 0.5 percent versus the
dollar from the daily mid-point but rarely moves towards the
extremes of that tight trading band.
 The yuan closed at 6.7976 against the dollar, up 0.42
percent from Friday's close and marking its biggest daily gain
against the U.S. currency since the revaluation set the
currency free to move in a managed floating exchange rate
system.
 The yuan climbed as far as 6.7958 in intraday trade,
another post-revaluation record and gained as much as 0.47
percent from the central bank's mid-point, nearly reaching the
0.5 percent daily trading band limit.
 Under intense pressure to act before the Group of 20
meeting in Canada later this week, China ditched the dollar peg
-- an emergency measure used to shield the economy from the
global financial crisis and resulting recession.
 NO REVALUATION
 The central bank on Sunday ruled out a one-off revaluation
similar to that of July 2005 and said there was no basis for
any big appreciation, adding that it would keep the exchange
rate at a basically stable level.
 Before trade started on Monday, the PBOC set the yuan's
daily mid-point at the same level as Friday -- 6.8275 --
disappointing some offshore players who were hoping for a clear
sign of appreciation.
 But as the PBOC pulled back from its often heavy daily
interventions, foreign and Chinese banks drove the yuan sharply
higher, suggesting that the PBOC is allowing the currency to
become more market-driven during the day.
 ""If it wants, it can make its intentions clearly felt with
tomorrow's mid-point, which will tell the market how much it
will allow the yuan to rise in one day,"" said a dealer at a
European bank in Shanghai.
 A mid-point near the average of Monday's spot trades --
estimated by traders at about 6.8100 against the dollar --
would suggest the PBOC will tolerate more yuan strength heading
into a Group of 20 meeting later in the week.
 The rise in yuan implied volatility was limited, suggesting
the market was not yet preparing for sharp gains or big daily
swings like those seen on Monday.
 NDFs JUMP, THEN STEADY
 Foreign hedge funds and other players drove down
dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards, but not as sharply as
might have been expected given the big move in spot, traders
said.
 In part that was because funds had already built up short
positions before the surprise weekend announcement, and also
because the PBOC's decision to keep the mid-point unchanged
sparked a round of short covering.
 Some traders said the steady mid-point on Monday was a
deliberate effort by Chinese authorities to fend off
speculators betting on yuan appreciation.
 Even with the depegging of the yuan from the dollar, most
traders are maintaining forecasts for the yuan to rise a
maximum 3 percent in 6 months and 5 to 6 percent in a year.
 Near-term three-month dollar-yuan non-deliverable forwards
were quoted at 6.7350 in late trade, implying yuan appreciation
of 1.4 percent over that period, but off a two-year low of
6.7200 hit in early trade against Friday's close of 6.7810.
 One-year NDFs were at 6.6350 bid in late afternoon,
implying 2.9 percent appreciation in a year compared with 1.8
percent implied on Friday, as measured from the mid-point. They
had initially fallen as low as 6.6210.

 By Naomi Tajitsu
 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - The euro and Australian dollar
hit their highest against the U.S. dollar in about a month on
Monday after China allowed the yuan to rise to a
post-revaluation high, boosting demand for riskier currencies.
 The single European currency extended its recovery versus
its U.S. counterpart, pulling further away from its weakest in
more than four years hit earlier in the month, but confidence in
the euro's recovery remained fragile.
 Spot yuan  rose to its highest since its 2005
revaluation on the view that a freer currency will be positive
for the global economic recovery, and spurred a rise in
commodity and oil prices and boosted riskier assets. 
 It also added to hopes of easing tensions in the Group of 20
leading economies ahead of a meeting later this week.
[ID:nBJD003795]
 ""The market's reaction has been pragmatic, both in terms of
scale and direction,"" said Daragh Maher, senior currency
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, noting that the euro's gains
had been subdued compared with the Australian dollar's rally.
 ""The bullish risk view supports the argument to sell the
dollar, but there are better ways to play it rather than buying
the euro. It makes more sense for Asian currencies and the
Aussie and kiwi to rise.""
 He added that China would be cautious about the pace of a
yuan appreciation, and in a note, Credit Agricole said that
given the euro's 13 percent fall versus the yuan this year,
Beijing may be wary of accelerating the currency's rise for fear
it could limit Chinese trade with Europe.
 The dollar slipped versus a basket of currencies <.DXY> to a
one-month low of 85.091 as the euro  rose to to $1.2490 on
trading platform EBS, its highest level since May 24.
 By 1106 GMT, the euro had pared gains to $1.2390. Traders
said option barriers at $1.2500 were preventing further gains,
reportedly being protected by a major Asian sovereign account.
 
 HIGH-YIELDERS 
 The euro posted its best weekly gain versus the dollar since
May 2009 as investors trimmed bets against the single currency,
buts its recovery remains fragile given concerns about the
impact of debt problems in some euro zone countries on the
global economy.

 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - The euro and Australian dollar
hit their highest levels in about a month on Monday after China
allowed the yuan to rise to a post-revaluation high, but
confidence in the single currency's recovery remained fragile.
 Spot yuan rose to its highest level since its revaluation
five years ago, adding to hopes that a pledge from China on yuan
flexibility would begin to reduce global imbalances and ease
tensions in the Group of 20 leading economies ahead of a meeting
next week.
 The move will boost China's buying power abroad and is seen
as broadly positive for the global economic recovery. It spurred
a worldwide rise in commodity and oil prices and boosted riskier
assets across the board. 
 ""This move takes the focus off China going into the G20. It
has supported risk appetite, which was already improving, and
high-yielders have been the main beneficiaries,"" said Lauren
Rosborough, senior currency strategist at Westpac.
 The dollar slipped versus a basket of currencies to trade at
a one-month low in Asia of 85.091, in turn allowing the euro to
rally to $1.2490 versus the dollar on trading platform EBS, its
highest level since May 24.
 By 0925 GMT, the euro had slipped back to trade with gains
of just 0.1 percent at $1.2403. Traders said there were option
barriers at $1.2500 preventing further gains, reportedly being
protected by a major Asian sovereign account.

 HIGH-YIELDERS 
 The higher-yielding Australian dollar gained 1.4 percent to
around $0.8840, off earlier highs of $0.8860, a one-month peak,
as European equities rallied one percent following strong gains
in Asian bourses.
 ""The MSCI Asia Pacific index was up 2.6%, with strength seen
across the region as China's policy statement is seen as a
strong sign of confidence in the global recovery story."" said
analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman in a note to clients.
 The New Zealand dollar also rose around one percent to
$0.7130, after having climbed to a five-week high of $0.7153.
 A higher yuan would help temper inflation in China by
pushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijing
would have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively.
 Markets have been worried China could over-tighten and slow
its economy too far.
The low-yielding yen slipped versus the euro, which traded at
113.25 yen, up 0.8 percent on the day. The dollar was up 0.6
percent versus the yen at 91.25 yen.

 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Emerging stocks and bonds surged
on Monday after China's decision to unshackle the yuan from its
dollar peg spurred a worldwide rise in commodity and oil prices
and boosted riskier assets across the board.
 The yuan  rose to its highest since being revalued
in July 2005 after China's central bank said on Saturday it
would gradually make the yuan rate more flexible.
 ""This should be constructive for long-term prospects for
Chinese growth in that we worry less about overheating. That is
good news for emerging companies that export to China,"" said
John Lomax, head of emerging equity strategy at HSBC in London.
 The benchmark MSCI emerging stocks index <.MSCIEF> jumped
2.5 percent to a six-week high, following big moves across Asian
equity markets where Chinese shares rose almost 3 percent
<.SSEC>, while Indian and Korean benchmarks <.BSESN> <.KS11>
gained over 1.5 percent.
 Emerging European stocks also rose 2.4 percent
<.MIEE00000PUS>, with the oil and metals-heavy Moscow bourse
<.IRTS> gaining almost 3 percent.
 The yuan move is likely to have a knock-on effect for Asian
and other emerging currencies, which also rose on Monday.
Analysts say policymakers will have to worry less about
competitiveness, therefore will have greater leeway to raise
interest rates and let currencies rise.
 ""With a stronger CNY, the purchasing power of the
Chinese will increase and imports should grow,"" SEB analysts
said in a note. 
 ""It should also give momentum to other emerging currencies
facing appreciation pressure such as the rouble, Brazilian real
as commodity currencies such as rand and Chilean peso.""
 The rouble rose nearly 1 percent versus its euro-dollar
basket to 34.06, it strongest since June 4  while the
South African rand  jumped 1.6 percent to a seven-week
high.
 
 OIL JUMP
 In central Europe, currencies were more subdued but still
rose between a quarter and half percent to the euro.
 Emerging bonds too strengthened, with sovereign dollar
bonds' spreads over U.S. Treasuries tightening 11 basis points
to 300 bps, the narrowest in five weeks, on the JPMorgan EMBI
Plus index <11EMJ>.
 The yuan move will reduce demand for Treasuries by reducing
the Chinese central bank's funds for vigorous buying of U.S.
bonds, while also increasing capital pouring into the assets of
commodity-producing economies.
 Spreads in oil and commodity exporting Russia squeezed in 16
bps. Oil prices have jumped 2 percent since the Chinese
announcement.
 Tighter debt spreads are likely to release a pent-up supply
of emerging Eurobonds, which have been unable to launch due to
poor market conditions. Syndicate officials estimate that
emerging sovereign and corporate deals worth tens of billions of
dollars have backed up due to the recent market paralysis.
 Already, a source told Reuters that the Export-Import Bank
of Korea (KEXIM) plans to sell a benchmark-sized 10-year dollar
bond at about 210 basis points over U.S. Treasuries.
 Analysts are divided on how long the current rally will
last.
 While emerging assets are attractively valued, many say the
yuan move may not be big enough, given the euro zone crisis has
not gone away. Tim Ash, RBS head of emerging European strategy,
saw the de-pegging as a sop to world leaders ahead of G20
meetings.
 ""Tensions will return after the G20, as the scope of
appreciation disappoints critics,"" Ash predicted.

 PARIS, June 21 (Reuters) - European Central Bank governing
council member Christian Noyer said on Monday that some banks
were facing funding problems, as banks continue to deposit cash
at the ECB as a result of current market uncertainty.
 ""Credit default swaps for banks have risen in line with
their sovereign credit default swap spreads. Some banks have

[ID:ECB001228]
 Fears that Greece's debt problems could spill over into
neighbouring countries have affected confidence in the banking
sector and governments are currently examining ""stress tests"" to
check how robust their countries' banks are.
 ECB governing council member and Bundesbank head Axel Weber
said last week that a new set of European bank stress tests was
needed, while Noyer also said he backed carrying out such tests.
[ID:nLDE65G1MO] [ID:nWEA6552]
 Noyer said it was imperative to tackle the issue of public
deficits for market confidence to return.
 ""Doubts about the sustainability of public finances in many
countries lie at the root of current uncertainty. Therefore, a
condition for market tensions to abate is that budgetary
discipline is implemented rigorously,"" he said.

 BRUSSELS, June 21 (Reuters) - EU regulators are
investigating whether imports of Chinese-made ceramic tiles are
being dumped in the EU market after a complaint from European
manufacturers.
 The European Commission said in its official journal dated
June 19 it had launched its investigation after a complaint was
lodged by the European Ceramic Tile Manufacturers' Federation

 The Commission has imposed punitive tariffs in the past on
items it rules are being dumped in the European Union.
 ""The prima facie evidence provided by the complainant shows
that the volume and the prices of the imported product under
investigation have ... had a negative impact on the quantities
sold and the market share held by the Union industry,"" the
Commission said.
 It said this had resulted in substantial adverse effects on
the overall performance of the EU industry.
 Karel De Gucht, the EU's trade chief, told Reuters in an
interview in April that dumping of Chinese-made goods in the
27-country bloc was one of the factors that were contributing to
strains in trade relations between Beijing and the EU.

 * West must not ""distort"" meaning of the reforms -Xinhua
(Adds commentary by Xinhua news agency, paragraphs 9-14)
 BEIJING, June 21 (Reuters) - China's pledge to reform the
yuan does not necessarily mean that the currency will strengthen
against the dollar, state media reported on Monday, citing
Chinese economists.
 The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling
Communist Party, said the yuan would float both up and down
against the dollar and that one-way appreciation was not the
thrust of the reform.
 ""Going further with exchange rate reform does not necessarily
equate to renminbi appreciation,"" the newspaper said. The yuan is
also knowm as the renminbi.
 But the report also went to considerable lengths to explain
to the domestic public why currency reform could benefit the
country after months in which top leaders had said a stable yuan
was essential to the economy's health and that China would not be
bullied into ending a nearly two-year-old peg to the dollar.
 The central bank said on Saturday that China would gradually
increase the exchange rate's flexibility, an announcement that
looked timed to head off criticism from abroad a week before a
G20 summit in Canada.
 Global markets and policymakers will closely monitor the
Chinese yuan this week for signs that the central bank is
actually allowing the currency to rise after its statement was
widely understood as a promise to do so.

New Tone, Same Old Yuan http://link.reuters.com/cad92m
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Ba Shusong, a researcher with the Development Research
Centre, a think-tank under the cabinet, was quoted as saying that
the foundation for yuan appreciation had significantly weakened
because China's current account surplus accounted for a smaller
and smaller portion of gross domestic product.
 Ha Jiming, chief economist at China International Capital
Corp, the country's largest investment bank, was quoted as saying
that the yuan may fall against the dollar if the euro plunges
against the U.S. currency because the Chinese exchange rate would
refer to a basket of currencies.
 China's official Xinhua news agency, in a strongly worded
commentary carried on its website (www.xinhuanet.com), warned the
West not to misinterpret or ""distort"" the meaning of the reforms.
 ""Firstly, 'increasing the flexibility of the renminbi's
exchange rate' does not equal renminbi appreciation, and it
certainly does not mean fast appreciation,"" it said.
 ""Stability in the renminbi's exchange rate is good not only
for China's economy, but for the world's,"" Xinhua added.
 The key to resolving global economic imbalances did not rest
at the yuan's door, it said.
 ""The fundamental way out for this problem is improving global
economic governance, reforming the international monetary system
and solving the development gap between the north and south.""
 In a pointed reference to the United States, Xinhua said some
developed countries had to stop spending so much, or ""eating next
year's food"" as the commentary termed it, using a Chinese idiom.
 However, the People's Daily said that yuan reform would be a
good thing, giving China ""three benefits"".
 First, it would help push forward structural adjustment of
the Chinese economy, putting it on a path towards sustainable
development. Second, it would assist in controlling inflation and
asset bubbles.
 And third, the newspaper highlighted the broader political
gains from the move. ""It will help protect the period of
strategic opportunity and the international environment for our
country's economic development,"" it said.

 * Yuan hits 5-year high as China allows more flexibility
 * Stocks, commodities up; dollar down broadly
 
 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a five-week
high, oil jumped and the euro rose briefly on Monday after China
pledged at the weekend to unshackle the yuan, easing tensions
with the West and boosting confidence in the global economy.
 Spot yuan climbed to its highest level against the dollar
since its last revaluation in July 2005 in a clear signal that
Beijing was sticking to its word that it would allow greater
currency flexibility.
 Coming just days before a Group of 20 summit in Toronto,
China's move would boost purchasing power and demand in the
world's third largest economy, encouraging investors globally to
buy risky assets.
 A higher yuan would also help temper inflation in China by
pushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijing
would have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively.
 ""China's flexibility comment has shown that it has
confidence in its own economy and that is good news for the
global economy, which is lifting commodity prices and therefore
miners,"" said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves
Lansdown.
MSCI world equity index rose 1 percent, hitting its highest
level since mid-May.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 1.4 percent, rising for
the ninth straight session to hit a 5-1/2 week peak, with basic
resources stocks being the biggest gainers.
 Emerging stocks rose 2.3 percent to a six-week high while
emerging sovereign debt spreads tightened 8 basis points to 302
bps, their narrowest in five weeks.
 U.S. stock futures rose around 1.5 percent, pointing to a
firmer open on Wall Street later.
 ""The move appears to reflect increased confidence that the
Chinese and world economies are growing in a stable and
sustainable fashion,"" UBS said in a note to clients.
 ""Almost certainly, China's leadership would not have taken
this step unless they were confident about economic and
financial stability.""
 U.S. crude oil rose 1.4 percent to $78.25 a barrel while
spot gold hit a record high of $1,264.90 an ounce, helped by the
fall in the dollar, which lost around 0.1 percent against a
basket of currencies.
 The euro rose to a one-month high near $1.2490 before
erasing gains to $1.2382, down 0.4 percent on the day.
 Breaking the peg might mean China needs to buy less U.S.
dollars in intervention, which would leave it with fewer dollars
to buy U.S. Treasuries, but also less need to diversify its
holdings into currencies like the euro.
 Bund futures fell 19 ticks as improving risk appetite
reduced demand for safe-haven government bonds.

 By Lu Jianxin and Koh Gui Qing
 SHANGHAI, June 21 (Reuters) - The yuan  soared to
a a five-year high on Monday as the Chinese central bank
stepped aside and tolerated broad gains on the first trading
day after its ditched the currency's two-year peg to the
dollar.
 The central bank appeared to be allowing the market find
its feet by not intervening and letting the yuan post its
biggest daily gains against the dollar since its revaluation in
July 2005, staying true to its pledge on the weekend that it
would allow greater currency flexibility.
 At the high of the day of 6.7969, spot yuan was up 0.43
percent from Friday's close of 6.8262.
 Traders said it was unlikely the yuan would repeat such
gains in coming days, and that Tuesday's mid-point setting
would be an important barometer of how much more appreciation
the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is willing to stomach.
 The central bank on Sunday ruled out a one-off revaluation
and said there was no basis for any big appreciation, adding
that it would keep the exchange rate at a basically stable
level.
 ""It appears the PBOC won't act to intervene in trading to
curb the yuan's rise today, as even a maximum 0.5 percent rise
would still be tolerable,"" said a dealer at a European Bank in
Shanghai.
 ""If it wants, it can make its intentions clearly felt with
tomorrow's mid-point, which will tell the market how much it
will allow the yuan to rise in one day.""

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 By late afternoon, the yuan was trading near 6.815.
 A mid-point near the average of Monday's spot trades would
suggest the PBOC will tolerate more yuan strength in the days
heading into a Group of 20 meeting later in the week.
 Earlier, the mid-point  was set at the same level
as Friday -- 6.8275 -- disappointing some offshore players
hoping for a clear sign of appreciation. But as the PBOC pulled
back from its often heavy daily interventions, foreign and
Chinese banks drove the yuan sharply higher.
 The yuan will likely pull back later in the session because
banks that shorted dollars will have cover those positions
before the end of the day due to Chinese foreign exchange
rules, analysts said. Banks are banned from holding short
dollar positions overnight.
 The yuan is allowed to trade 0.5 percent up or down versus
the dollar relative to the mid-point and rarely moves much
within that tight trading band.
 NDFs JUMP, THEN STEADY
 Foreign hedge funds and other players did not drive down
dollar/yuan offshore forwards sharply as the Chinese currency
strengthened, having already started building up hefty
positions betting on greater appreciation.
 The spot yuan's previous post-revaluation high was 6.8099,
set in September 2008.
 The rush into non-deliverable forwards  caused a
sharp downward shift in the curve, though the initial move was
kept in check by the PBOC keeping the mid-point unchanged.
 Some traders said the steady mid-point was a deliberate
effort by Chinese authorities to fend off speculators betting
on yuan appreciation.
 Even with the depegging of the yuan from the dollar, most
traders are maintaining forecasts for the yuan to rise a
maximum 3 percent in 6 months and 5-6 percent in a year.
 Near-term three-month dollar-yuan non-deliverable forwards
 were quoted at a two-year low of 6.7200 in early
trade against Friday's close of 6.7810, implying yuan
appreciation of 1.6 percent over that time versus from 0.7
percent on Friday. Three-month NDFs later pulled back to
6.7380.
 One-year NDFs  were at 6.6210, implying 3.1
percent appreciation compared with 1.8 percent on Friday.
 The market had expected the PBOC to allow the mid-point to
rise 5 to 10 pips after the PBOC's statement over the weekend,
so the fixing showed hat the PBOC wanted to dampen speculation.
 But the central bank could use major Chinese state-owned
banks trading on its behalf in the spot market to guide the
yuan up or down, regardless of the mid-point, dealers said.
 ""It appears the central bank will adopt a new strategy,
using the market to guide the yuan up or down,"" said a senior
dealer at a Chinese state-owned bank in Beijing.
 ""That will look more market-oriented,"" he said. ""The
mid-point will remain a choice but it will be used for a
stronger central bank signal for where it hopes the yuan will
go.""

 * Chinese currency to edge up to 6.58 by mid-2011
 BEIJING, June 21 (Reuters) - China will be true to its word
and prevent a sharp rise in the newly unshackled yuan over the
next year, according to a Reuters poll conducted on Monday.
 The median forecast of 33 economists is that the yuan will
end 2010 at 6.67 per dollar.
 That would mark a rise of 2.4 percent from the level that
obtained before Beijing said on Saturday that it would let the
currency start moving flexibly once again after pegging it near
6.83 for 23 months during the global financial crisis.
 The projection is close to the appreciation implied in the
offshore non-deliverable forwards market, where the six-month
tenor was quoted at a midpoint of 6.7025 at 0725 GMT.
 Looking further ahead, the median forecast of 29 economists
is for the yuan to creep up to 6.58 per dollar by the end of
June 2011, compared with a 12-month NDF midpoint of 6.6275.
 The survey points to a rise in the yuan's value against the
dollar of 3.8 percent over the next year.
 The limited appreciation reflected in the poll results
chimes with the central bank's emphasis that the rise in the
yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), would be gradual.
 ""With the balance-of-payments account moving closer to
equilibrium, the basis for large-scale appreciation of the RMB
exchange rate does not exist,"" the People's Bank of China said
n a statement on Saturday.
 By mid-afternoon, the yuan had gained 0.35 percent from its
opening level as the PBOC allowed traders to drive the currency
higher. But the Reuters poll suggests such a rapid rate of
climb will not last long.
 ""Following this weekend's statement, the spot rate is
likely to resume appreciation, but the pace will be very
gradual,"" Qian Wang and Grace Ng, economists at J.P. Morgan,
said.
 ""The pace of RMB/USD appreciation will likely be
accelerated as the Chinese government gains more confidence in
the resilience of the global economic recovery and a
soft-landing of the domestic economy. We continue to expect
RMB/USD to reach 6.6 by end of this year,"" they added in a note
to clients.

and oil group A.P. Moller-Maersk have made it more competitive
than before the economic crisis began, its chief executive said

 ""Rates have increased, but more importantly,
we have taken out costs by, among other things, reducing fuel
consumption through slow steaming and better planning,"" CEO Nils
Smedegaard Andersen said in Maersk Post.
 ""We are more competitive today than before the crisis,""

 The global shipping industry is clawing back from a steep
plunge in 2008-2009 as world trade recovers.
 The conglomerate's Maersk Line, which is the world's biggest
container shipping company, dragged the A.P. Moller-Maersk group
into the red last year, but increasing freight rates and volumes
helped it back to profits in the first quarter of this year.
 ""Only if we keep the momentum we have gained in the last 18
months will we be able to maintain the leadership positions we
gained during 2009,"" Andersen said.
 Maersk Line chief Eivind Kolding told the magazine that the
company is ""out of the storm"" and now aims to widen its gap to
rivals by improving reliability of its service.
 ""We can see there is huge potential for Maersk Line to
perform better in terms of reliability,"" Kolding said.
 He said that Maersk Line aims to raise its on-time delivery
performance to 95 percent from 70 percent now.
 ""Such a dramatic increase in reliability would allow our
customers to significantly reduce their inventory buffer and
would increase our lead over our competitors,"" Kolding said.

he said.
 The yuan rose as high as about 0.4 percent to 6.8015 per
dollar after China broke away from its 23-month-old currency peg.
 That was enough for the the Aussie and the euro to recover
from initial disappointment after China set the yuan's daily
mid-point at 6.8275 against the dollar on Monday, unchanged from
last Friday, the day before Beijing said it would allow the yuan
to trade more flexibly.
 ""You can't gauge Beijing's stance on the yuan just from
today's mid-point. Obviously we will have to see how much yuan
appreciation they allow for the time being,"" said Shuichi
Kanehira, head of forex spot trading at Mizuho Corporate Bank.
 The Aussie gained 1.2 percent to around $0.8824, rising as
high as $0.8830, a one-month peak.
 The New Zealand dollar also rose nearly one percent to
$0.7121, after having climbed to a five-week high of $0.7140.
 The euro gained to $1.2457, up 0.6 percent. It earlier marked
a four-week high around $1.2490 in early Asian hours.
 The dollar gained 0.1 percent to 90.77 yen, rebounding higher
from an earlier three-week low of 90.01 on trading platform EBS.
 Westpac senior currency strategist Imre Speizer said for a
variety of reasons the yuan weekend statement was seen as
positive for commodity currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, including the prospect of improved exports to
China.
 ""This move may also have been designed to reduce friction at
the G20 meeting involving trade issues,"" Speizer said.
 The yuan's value had been seen as a potential point of
conflict at the Group of 20 summit in Toronto on June 26-27, as
Washington pressed for moves to a market-based exchange rate,
while Beijing had said the currency was its own business and
outsiders should not meddle.
 Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS in Sydney saw the dollar
reaching 6.55 yuan by year end, with this appreciation of between
3 and 4 percent likely achieved in the next few weeks.
 A more flexible yuan would lessen the threat of a Sino-U.S.
trade war, which could have been a danger to global growth, and
enable China to buy more commodities, or at least cope better
with higher commodity prices, a positive for big resource
exporters like Australia and New Zealand.
 A higher yuan would also help temper inflation in China by
pushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijing
would have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively.
 Markets have been worried China could over-tighten and slow
its economy too far.
 Breaking the peg might mean China needs to buy less U.S.
dollars in intervention, which would leave it with fewer dollars
to buy U.S. Treasuries, but also less need to diversify its
holdings into currencies like the euro.

 By Saikat Chatterjee
 HONG KONG, June 21 (Reuters) - Indonesian yields fell by
their most in nearly a month on Monday after China pledged to
increase exchange rate flexibility and Moody's upgraded its
outlook on the country's sovereign debt rating.
 Other bond markets also rallied, though to a lesser extent,
on views China's move would pushing Asian currencies higher and
lure more buyers to the region's government bonds.
 The spot yuan rate rose to a 21-month high of 6.8154
against the dollar, up 0.16 percent from Friday and many
economists see the currency strengthening further in coming
days, albeit at a modest pace.
 ""There might be a dip in short-term yields as investors
will look towards the short end of the curve to lock into FX
gains, and many of these short-term flows will be parked
there,"" said Lum Choong Kuan, head of fixed income at CIMB
Investment Bank.
 Philippine bond yields fell by 2-3 basis points across the
board and Malaysian yields slipped by 1-2 bps points even as
the ringgit rallied nearly 2 percent in early deals.
 Among regional currencies, the ringgit has been the star
performer with gains of more than 6.5 percent so far this year
followed by the rupiah and the baht.
 According to the Lipper Global Indexes, Malaysian local
currency bonds are one of the top five performers so far with a
year-to-date gains of nearly 7 percent.
 Only Thailand bucked the broader trend, with five-year bond
yields rising by 3 basis points to 3 percent from Friday's
close following higher U.S. Treasury bond yields.
 In Indonesia, which has seen record inflows this year in
its bond markets along with South Korea and Malaysia, yields
fell further after Moody's outlook upgrade led by buying by
offshore investors.
 By afternoon, ten-year bond yields were down 20 basis
points, the biggest drop since late May, to a record low of 8.2
percent. It has fallen 100 basis points so far this month.
 ""Asian local currency bonds are the obvious trade,"" said
Endre Pedersen, a fund manager at MFC Global Investment
Management.
 But with yields already at record lows in some markets,
fund managers are now scouting for new opportunities.
 ""Lots of foreigners are already in Indonesia, so you want
to ask yourself where else can they go and Philippines is a
market that is still lagging and the rates are still
attractive,"" MFC's Pedersen said.
 The Philippine central bank kept rates steady at its last
policy meeting and it cut its 2010 and 2011 inflation
forecasts, a move analysts said signaled interest rates could
stay at record low levels for some time.
 Reinforcing such a view, a deputy governor said on Sunday
average inflation would rise in coming months but would likely
stay within target for the year, giving the central bank more
policy flexibility,
 Asian local currency bonds would see more buying in the
coming months, especially in shorter-dated bonds, traders said.
 But analysts said a sharp rally might be tempered by
various factors such as expected rate hikes in Malaysia and
India, a changing political landscape in Thailand and possible
curbs on hot money in Indonesia.

 (Adds Belarus energy minister comment)
 By Dmitry Zhdannikov
 MOSCOW, June 21 (Reuters) - Russia cut gas supplies to
Belarus by 15 percent on Monday pressing its neighbour to pay a
$192 million debt and raising the possibility of a reduction in
flows to Europe.
Relations between the two have soured since they failed to
agree on unified customs rules and Belarus gave refuge to ousted
Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, despite Moscow's support for
the new Kyrgyz leadership.
 Russia supplies a quarter of Europe's gas needs and uses
Belarus, which borders European Union member Poland, as one of
two key transit routes or oil and gas to the continent.
 Previous pricing disputes with Minsk led to oil supply cuts,
with Poland and Germany being affected most. Poland gets about
40 percent of its Russian gas through Belarus.
 Belarus pledged to ensure uninterrupted deliveries.
 ""We are taking all measures so that the transit will remain
safe, so that the customers, which receives gas through our
transit pipelines, will not feel any cuts,"" Deputy Energy
Minister Eduard Tovpenets told reporters in Minsk.
 A similar standoff with Kiev halted the much larger Russian
gas supplies across Ukraine for almost two weeks in January
2009, leaving many Europeans without fuel during a cold snap.
 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told gas monopoly Gazprom
to cut supplies from Monday, the Kremlin's press office said.
Gazprom said it had started implementing the order and reduced
supplies by 15 percent from 10 am.
 ""Strictly speaking, Gazprom has the contract right to cut
supplies by 85 percent or more but is not doing it given our
special relations with Belarussian consumers,"" Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin said.
 Belarus' First Deputy Premier Vladimir Semashko said the
debt could be repaid within two weeks. ""We will borrow but
repay,"" he said.
 Russian gas transit via Belarus amounts to one-tenth of
Europe's needs, much smaller than the transit via Ukraine,
totalling around 45 million cubic metres a day.
 ""Belarus transits about 9 percent of Russian gas going to
Europe and this is 15 percent of 9 percent,"" Jonathan Stern, a
Russian gas expert at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies,
said.
 ""The only country for which this could be an issue is Poland
because Poland gets a lot of its gas through the Belarus line.
But we are in June.""

 
 GAZPROM SAYS COULD REROUTE
 ""While a lengthy suspension... could cause supply problems
for Europe, we do not anticipate any major supply disruptions
over the summer months as a result of reduced European demand
and available spare supply capacity through Ukraine,"" said
Alexander Burgansky of Renaissance Capital brokerage.
 ""At the same time, we believe the crisis is likely to be
over by autumn, judging by the timeline of similar disputes in
the past,"" he added.
 Prices in European gas markets were stable to slightly lower
on Monday, in contrast to a rise in prices seen during Russia's
rows with Ukraine in 2009.
 The European Union said on Monday it expected Russian gas to
continue flowing to the bloc, and Polish gas monopoly PGNiG said
it was seeing normal supplies and did not expect any changes.
 ""We are counting it will not affect them (EU members),
because otherwise Russia would become not a credible partner for
the EU, and we believe we are talking to a very credible
partner,"" said Jerzy Buzek, head of the EU Parliament.
 Gazprom stock closed up 2.18 percent, slightly below the
broader Russian market, propelled by higher oil prices and
largely ignoring the news about cuts.
 Western politicians have repeatedly accused Russia of using
its energy might as a tool of intimidation against its smaller
neighbours and have called on the continent to diversify away
from Russian deliveries.
 The gas cuts to Belarus come days after Russia's top
investment conference in St Petersburg, where Medvedev said the
country was changing its ways, modernising and becoming more
appealing to global investments.
 Gazprom says Belarus has been paying $150 per 1,000 cubic
meters, instead of the $169.20 that the company charged in the
first quarter and $184.80 in the second, which created the debt.
 Belarus has said Moscow owes it $200 million for transit and
Gazprom has long denied it. On Monday, Gazprom acknowledged the
debt existed but blamed Minsk for blocking payments.
 Gazprom has said it has the capacity to reroute the European
gas supplies away from Belarus and that the impact of the cuts
will be less severe due to lower summer-time needs.
 Weak industrial demand in the economic crisis and plentiful
supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) also have reduced demand
for Russian pipeline gas.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2010 01:38AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-UPDATE 1-Fitch: Japan needs credible fiscal fix plan," * No credible fiscal fix plan by year-end negative for Japan
 * Japan sovereign ratings have stable outlook for now
 * China yuan move not a key ratings driver
 By Rika Otsuka and Hiroyasu Hoshi
 TOKYO, June 21 (Reuters) - Japan's sovereign ratings could
come under downward pressure if it has no credible fiscal reform
plan in place by year-end, Fitch Ratings said on Monday.
 The country needs such a scheme to head-off longer-term risks
arising from declining domestic savings, Andrew Colquhoun, a
Fitch sovereign ratings analyst for Asia Pacific, told Reuters in
an interview.
 Japan's government will announce plans on Tuesday on how it
will tackle huge public debt and bring its budget deficit under
control.
 ""What would be negative to ratings is if Japan has no
credible fiscal adjustment plans in place by the end of year,""
Colquhoun said.
 He said earlier in the day at Fitch's global banking
conference held in Tokyo that the rating agency is concerned
about Japan's falling savings and weak economic growth in the
longer-term.
 Japan's large bank savings help the bond market digest huge
issuance of Japanese government debt.
 Fitch thinks a credible fiscal reform plan should be detailed
and flexible, as well as showing strong political commitment.
 The company is looking for a sustained fiscal consolidation
plan over the medium-term, Colquhoun continued.
 ""From that perspective, we are not overly focused on a debt
issuance target in one year.""
 But so far, the outlook for Japan's sovereign ratings remains
stable, supported by the nation's strong financing flexibility,
Colquhoun said.
 The government last week unveiled a growth strategy, pledging
to cut corporate tax to meet its economic growth target of 2
percent in the coming decade.
 Fitch rates Japan's long-term foreign and local currency
issuer default ratings at AA and AA-minus respectively.
 Japan's public debt has ballooned to double the size of its
economy.
 Colquhoun also said that a change in China's forex system
would not be a key ratings driver for that country.
 China said on Saturday that it would gradually make the yuan
more flexible, in a gesture that may deflect foreign criticism at
a meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Canada from June 26-27.

 By Veronica Brown
 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Key commodities including
industrial metals and crude oil jumped on Monday after China
said it would make its currency more flexible, melting some
uncertainty on demand from the resource-consuming giant.
 Nervousness over developments elsewhere, with a spotlight on
European debt, was still evident and helped propel gold prices
to record highs.
 Although China made clear on Saturday that a one-off step
change in its exchange rate similar to 2005 was not on the
cards, analysts expected the yuan to rise slowly, adding to its
nearly 20 percent gain since its last revaluation in 2005.
 Spot yuan climbed to its highest level against the dollar
since its last revaluation in July 2005 in a clear signal that
Beijing was sticking to its word.
 Analysts said the move had proved a boon to commodity
markets as the increased purchasing power of the currency would
offset worries about the impact of China's anti-inflationary
measures on demand.
 ""This is all very finely balanced with very small numbers --
perhaps people are saying now there is direction, so instead of
being pegged the yuan will crawl up or down but hopefully up,""
said Ashok Shah, chief investment officer at fund London and
Capital.
 After China raised its exchange rate in 2005, by 2.1
percent, commodities rallied for more than a year, although not
solely because of Beijing's move.
 Last year, the country spent around 607 billion yuan ($89
billion) on importing oil, 343 billion yuan ($50 billion) on
iron ore and 206 billion yuan ($30 billion) on copper.
 Crude gained 1.9 percent to $78.66 a barrel at 1400 GMT,
with China's move seen as raising expectations of higher demand
from the world's second largest energy consumer.
 With China also consuming more than 30 percent of the global
copper market, benchmark London Metal Exchange copper rose 3.3
percent to $6,653 a tonne, but was well off the mid-April's
peaks just above $8,000.
 ""We know China has a voracious appetite for raw materials...
Imports will be cheaper,"" said Robin Bhar, analyst at Credit
Agricole.
 But while the immediate reaction to China's move has been
positive, analysts were cautious on the impact.
 ""This is not a game-changer and trade tensions will soon
return. What's more, even a much bigger move would do nothing to
boost the global economy without additional steps to increase
demand within China itself,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
 Analysts have talked about a rise in the order of 5-10
percent in the yuan over the year, effectively making imported
raw materials less expensive for Chinese buyers.
 
 GOLD SHINES OUT
 While most commodity markets including industrial precious
metal palladium were swept up by China, gold prices latched onto
dollar weakness and continued uncertainty surrounding European
sovereign debt, helping prices to strike a record high at
$1,264.90 an ounce.
 Gold prices have risen more than 15 percent this year as
rising concerns over sovereign debt levels in Europe and the
prospect of further financial market instability boosted
interest in the precious metal as a haven from risk.
 Its long-running inverse relationship with the dollar
weakened as risk aversion fuelled buying of both assets, but a
slide in the U.S. currency on Monday was again adding further
impetus to its run higher, analysts said.
 ""Dollar strength can help gold, and dollar weakness can help
gold as well,"" said Michael Lewis, head of commodities research
at Deutsche Bank.
 In grain markets, U.S. corn futures hit a three-week high,
while soybeans also rose as dealers had already been encouraged
by strong demand from China.
 China's soy imports in the year to September 2010 are likely
to rise to a record 46 million tonnes from an early estimate of
44 million, according to estimates issued by the China National
Grain and Oils Information Centre last month.

 * Ono: should raise sales tax next year to boost jobs, demand
 * Boosting jobs, demand is best solution to deflation
 * Further BOJ easing would hardly help beat deflation
 * Govt shares Ono's view but analysts doubt if feasible
(Adds analyst quotes, details)
 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, June 21 (Reuters) - Japan should ""substantially"" raise
its sales tax and other taxes from next year to create jobs and
beat deflation rather than seek further monetary easing, an
economic adviser to Prime Minister Naoto Kan said.
 Kan, 63, who has made fiscal reform a top priority since
taking office this month, has suggested a possible doubling of
the sales tax to 10 percent to help curb Japan's huge public
debt, which is twice the size of its GDP, the worst in the
developed world.
 Osaka University Professor Yoshiyasu Ono said the Bank of
Japan needs to keep its current easy policy but printing more
money would not resolve the problem of persistent price falls.
 Ono advocates using revenues from tax rises to create new
demand and jobs, which he said would help beat deflation and fix
Japan's fiscal woes, a theory reflected in a ""Third Way"" growth
model advocated by the prime minister.
 ""The consumption tax should be raised as early as next year,""
Ono, who has been appointed one of the three advisers on economic
and fiscal policy at the Cabinet Office, told Reuters in an
interview on Friday.
 ""Substantial tax hikes are needed if we are to create new
jobs and cut the jobless rate to 3 percent"" from the current 5.1
percent to maximise employment needed to spur consumption and
beat deflation, he said.
 Ono's comments come before the government on Tuesday is due
to announce its plan to fix Japan's tattered finances, ahead of
upper house elections on July 11.
 TAX HIKES RATHER THAN PRESSURE ON BOJ
 Ono, 59, became acquainted with Kan a decade ago and has
advised him on economic policy in earnest since taking up the job
at the Cabinet Office in February.
 ""His basic stance -- do not force things on the BOJ but make
use of tax increases to achieve economic growth and fiscal
rebuilding -- is clearly reflected in the government's policy,""
said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
 ""But market players do not believe tax hikes would come so
quickly given differences of opinions among politicians as well
as voters.""
 Ono said the income and inheritance tax rates also need to be
raised so the rich shoulder more of the tax burden.
 ""The point is that revenues from tax hikes should be spent on
creation of new jobs, not repayment of public debt,"" Ono said.
 Tax hikes should not cause a financial burden on the people
because all the increases are immediately returned to them
through salaries for the jobs created, he said. People would also
benefit from the newly created services.
 ""In addition, the increase in employment reduces deflation
and removes employment insecurity, which in turn stimulates
households' consumption,"" he said.
 ""Thus, social service provision, job increases, economic
growth, and tax revenues increase are all achieved,"" he said,
shrugging off worries by some that tax hikes could cool
consumption and tame growth in the near term.
 Ono also rejected concerns by some economists that the ""Third
Way"" policy could pave the way for big government.
 ""I'm not opposing regulatory reforms or calling for increases
in the number of public servants,"" he said.
 The key is to let people work in areas such as nursing care
and social infrastructure development, where public support is
needed but would not crowd out private-sector initiatives, he
said.
 Ono said such policies as adopted by Kan were an antidote
both to the traditional big spending on public works of the
ousted Liberal Democratic Party and the supply-side stance of LDP
maverick Junichiro Koizumi during his 2001-2006 term as premier.
 While Japan has been plagued by lack of demand since the
bursting of its asset bubble in the early 1990s, Ono argued that
the LDP's growth models had failed to fill a gap between supply
and demand in the economy and to resolve the problem of
deflation.
 ""Deflation can be beaten only by reducing the deflationary
gap through expansion in aggregate demand and employment,"" he
said, adding that expansion of the monetary base has not led to
an increase in consumer prices since the bursting of the bubble.
 ""The BOJ has been expanding credit to its maximum, so the
government should not press the BOJ to take further action. It
can only ask the central bank to keep its current easy policy.""

 By Tetsushi Kajimoto
 TOKYO, June 21 (Reuters) - Japan's finance minister welcomed
Beijing's announcement that it will allow more flexibility in the
yuan currency, saying the move will benefit both China and the
world economy.
 ""I expect it to be a plus for the China and Asia economies
as well as the world economy. Basically I welcome it,"" Yoshihiko
Noda told reporters at the ministry on Monday.
 The People's Bank of China announced on Saturday that it
would resume making the yuan more flexible, signalling that it
was ready to break a 23-month-old peg to the dollar that had come
under intense international criticism.
 But on Sunday it ruled out a one-off move, said there was no
basis for any big appreciation and added it will keep the
exchange rate at a basically stable level.
 Global markets celebrated on Monday at the merest hint that
China would let its currency appreciate, showing just how badly
China is needed to drive a recovery in the sagging world economy.
 However, they gave back some gains after the Chinese central
bank set its daily reference rate on Monday at 6.8275 per dollar,
unchanged from its reference point on Friday -- the day before it
promised to allow the yuan to trade more flexibly.
 Spot yuan hit its highest close since the currency's July
2005 revaluation.
 The yuan is allowed to trade 0.5 percent either side of the
reference point against the dollar, so is an important marker for
trading sentiment.
 The announcement was made as the Group of 20 nations prepares
to meet in Canada this weekend to hash out a course for the
future as the world gradually emerges from the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression.
 ""I agree with the view that China has taken this step just in
time for the G20 meeting,"" Japan's deputy finance minister
Motohisa Ikeda told reporters.
 ""There was no change (in the yuan rate) today, but I will
closely watch how (yuan reform) will affect the Japanese economy
as it could have a big impact on world economy.""
 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa met with Prime
Minister Naoto Kan on Monday to exchange views before the G20
meeting. Shirakawa declined to tell reporters what was
specifically discussed.
 China has taken over from the United States as Japan's No.1
export destination.
 But Tokyo has been more reserved than some of its G7 peers in
its criticism of China's currency system on the view that
pressuring Beijing could backfire.

 * Aussie, NZ dollars cut gains on some China disappointment
 * Spot yuan hits highest since Sept 2008
 * Euro rebounds towards 4-wk high after a brief pull back
 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, June 21 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar cut some of
its earlier sharp gains and the euro pulled back from a four-week
high against the dollar on Monday after a sign that China would
proceed only gradually in its push to make the yuan more
flexible.
 China's central bank set the yuan's daily mid-point at 6.8275
against the dollar on Monday, unchanged from last Friday, the day
before Beijing said it would allow the yuan to trade more
flexibly.
 This initially disappointed some market players who had
expected a strengthening of about 0.5 percent for Monday's
central bank fixing after the country indicated it was ready to
break a 23-month-old U.S. dollar peg that had come under intense
fire from abroad.
 But Spot yuan rose to its highest since 2008 against the
dollar, and market optimism remained that China's pledge on yuan
flexibility was a vote of confidence in the global economic
recovery's staying power, helping higher-yielding and riskier
assets such as the Australian dollar and U.S. stock futures to
hold strength, traders said.
 ""China's commitment to allowing more yuan flexibility is
definitely an encouraging factor for stability in the market,""
said Hideki Amikura, deputy general manager of the forex section
at Nomura Trust Bank.
 ""It is a sign that China is ready to act responsibly to fix
global imbalances and avoid potential international conflicts,""
he said.
 The Aussie retreated from its earlier high around $0.8830, a
one-month peak, after the yuan mid-point was announced, but held
firmly at $0.8806, up 1 percent on the day.
 The New Zealand dollar also cut an earlier 1.2 percent rise
to a five-week high of $0.7140, but was still up 0.7 percent at
$0.7105.
 The euro stood at $1.2431, up 0.4 percent, after briefly
pulling back from a high around $1.2490 traded in early Asian
hours.
 The dollar gained 0.1 percent to 90.77 yen, rebounding higher
from an earlier low of 90.01 on trading platform EBS.
 Westpac senior currency strategist Imre Speizer said for a
variety of reasons the yuan weekend statement was seen as
positive for commodity currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, including the prospect of improved exports to
China.
 ""This move may also have been designed to reduce friction at
the G20 meeting involving trade issues,"" Speizer said.
 The yuan's value had been seen as a potential point of
conflict at the Group of 20 summit in Toronto on June 26-27, as
Washington pressed for moves to a market-based exchange rate,
while Beijing had said the currency was its own business and
outsiders should not meddle.
 Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS in Sydney saw the dollar
reaching 6.55 yuan by year end, with this appreciation of between
3 and 4 percent likely achieved in the next few weeks.
 A more flexible yuan would lessen the threat of a Sino-U.S.
trade war, which could have been a danger to global growth, and
enable China to buy more commodities, or at least cope better
with higher commodity prices, a positive for big resource
exporters like Australia and New Zealand.
 A higher yuan would also help temper inflation in China by
pushing down import prices, which in turn could mean Beijing
would have less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively.
 Markets have been worried China could over-tighten and slow
its economy too far.
 Breaking the peg might mean China needs to buy less U.S.
dollars in intervention, which would leave it with fewer dollars
to buy U.S. Treasuries, but also less need to diversify its
holdings into currencies like the euro.

 By Mark Bendeich and James Grubel
 SYDNEY/CANBERRA, June 21 (Reuters) - Australia and China
inked commercial deals worth more than $8.8 billion on Monday,
largely in mining, in another sign that a new Australian mining
tax has failed to dampen inward Chinese investment.
 The signings, witnessed by visiting Chinese Vice-President
Xi Jinping, included deals for state-owned China Development
Bank to provide financing for several major mining projects,
including a $1.2 billion loan for an iron ore development.
 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who is fighting a
fierce mining backlash against the 40 percent mine-profits tax,
highlighted that seven of the 10 bilateral deals signed on
Monday covered the resources and energy industries.
 ""The Chinese are still active partners with all of our
resource companies. There is a lot of good stuff going on out
there,"" Rudd told reporters after the signings.
 ""It is important to separate the facts of what's going on
from some of the fear that is being pushed by some companies
who object to paying a bit more tax.""
 Miners have threatened to axe more than $20 billion in new
Australian projects if the tax is introduced in its current
form. The world's second biggest iron ore miner, Rio Tinto
 , has said that Australia is now its top
sovereign-risk issue worldwide.
 The miners' warnings, backed up by a multi-million-dollar
industry ad campaign, has unnerved the public ahead of a
general election expected to be held late this year, with
opinion polls showing almost half voters against the new tax.
 But the industry's campaign has begun to be undermined by a
continued wave of investment into the sector since the tax was
first unveiled on May 2. Even while campaigning against the
tax, miners have announced project advancements or deals with
foreign investors worth more than $10 billion. [ID:nSGE65G00C]
 CHINA STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE
 Far from being spooked by the new tax, due to apply from
mid-2012, Chinese firms could see it as a chance to strengthen
their grip on Australian raw materials, especially iron ore, by
providing financing in return for long-term supply agreements.
 The China Development Bank agreed on Monday a $1.2 billion
loan facility for the $2 billion Karara iron ore project in
west Australia, which is being developed by Australia's
Gindalbie Metals Ltd  and China's Angang Steel Co
<000898.SZ>.
 The bank also inked a preliminary deal to help fund
projects for miner Aquila Resources , including its
$3.45 billion West Pilbara iron ore project, also in west
Australia.
 Rudd, who aims to use the mining tax to help fund his
re-election platform this year, oversaw the signings along with
Xi, regarded as heir apparent to China's President Hu Jintao.
 Monday's agreements also included an expanded partnership
between Australia's dominant phone company, Telstra Corp
, and China's ZTE Corp <0763.HK>, whereby Telstra would
become preferred telecoms supplier to ZTE worldwide.
 In addition, Australian airline Qantas  also
announced on Monday an expanded code-sharing alliance with
China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS>.

 HONG KONG, June 21 (Reuters) - Stocks and commodities
jumped on Monday and U.S. Treasuries fell as investors bet
China will allow the yuan to rise after promising more currency
flexibility, easing political tensions with the West and
encouraging investors to snap up riskier assets.
 The spot yuan rate edged up to 6.8110 against the dollar,
its strongest level since September 2008, after China's central
bank signalled at the weekend that it was unshackling the
currency from its de facto 23-month-old peg.
 Many analysts see the currency strengthening further in
coming days, albeit at a very modest pace, with greater
purchasing power of the world's third-largest economy becoming
a strong global investment theme.
 ""This provides a positive psychological boost to Asian
financial markets, so not just Asian equity markets but also
Asian currencies and bond markets as well,"" Khiem Do, head of
Asian multi asset at Baring Asset Management in Hong Kong, told
Reuters Insider television.
 Do's exposure to China was domestically focused, with bets
on property and infrastructure stocks. He also was bullish on
Chinese companies with U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
 Oil, metals and other commodity prices rose on hopes
China's increased purchasing power will boost demand, and
currencies from economies that have a large share of exports to
China -- Australia, Taiwan, South Korea, Brazil -- were
expected to keep strengthening.
 China's central bank said late on Saturday it was ready to
make the yuan more flexible, citing a global economic recovery
and more balanced external trade.
 On Sunday Beijing ruled out a one-off move, saying there
was no basis for any big appreciation and that it will keep the
exchange rate at a basically stable level.
 Nevertheless, the apparent policy change triggered a rally
in riskier assets, with investors growing more confident about
China's key role in the global economic recovery, offsetting
worries about Europe's festering sovereign debt crisis.
 Japan's Nikkei share average jumped 2.4 percent to a
one-month high, with China-linked stocks performing
particularly well. Shares of Hitachi Construction and Komatsu
rose 6.6 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively.
 Both companies assemble and sell their products in China.
 The rise in the Nikkei was welcome news after government
data showed foreign investors had sold $10 billion of Japanese
stocks two weeks ago, the largest weekly outflow since March
2008.
 ""We may well be able to say that the heavy foreign selling
of two weeks ago has now come to an end,"" said Nagayuki
Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities in Tokyo.
 The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan surged
nearly 3 percent, led by the materials, energy and industrial
sectors.
 The MSCI index has already retraced more than half the
losses incurred in the past two months resulting from concerns
about Europe's debt crisis, though is still down 3.2 percent
this year.
 Hong Kong's stock market, the gateway to China for most
global equity investors, rose 2.8 percent while the Shanghai
composite index gained 2.1 percent.
 Chinese airline stocks were a big target, with China
Southern Airlines gaining 8 percent, on hopes that a stronger
yuan will help reduce fuel costs.
 Initial gains slipped at one point after China's central
bank left the yuan's daily mid-point unchanged from Friday, but
upward momentum recovered as the currency rose in the spot
market.
 U.S. stock futures rose 1.2 percent, pointing to a stronger
open on Wall Street later in the day.
 GATEWAY TO CHINA
 Emerging Asian currencies also rose sharply.
 Reasons for strength were two-fold: Asian reserve managers
would not have to curb their own currency strength as much for
competitive reasons if China lets the yuan rise, and hopes for
more exports to China.
 The U.S. dollar dropped 2.5 percent against the Korean won
and was on pace for the biggest single-day decline in 13
months. The dollar was also down 1.6 percent against the
Malaysian ringgit
 ""It's going to be a softly-softly approach in our view (for
yuan appreciation). It is good for risk appetite, it is good
for Asian currencies in general,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of
global foreign exchange strategy with Credit Agricole CIB in
Hong Kong.
 The euro and Australian dollar were steady on the day,
having surrendered early gains after China left the daily
mid-point of the yuan's exchange rate unchanged from Friday.
 The euro was at $1.2430 and the Australian dollar was at
US$0.8812
 U.S. Treasuries fell as cash was moved to riskier plays
offering potentially higher returns. The benchmark yield on the
10-year note was up 6 basis points from late Friday in New York
to 3.28 percent
 Commodities prices rallied as well on expectations that
China's already voracious demand for raw materials would only
increase.
 Brent crude futures were up 1.7 percent to $79.52 a barrel
and U.S. crude was up 1.9 percent to $78.67 a barrel at the
highest in six weeks.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 1.3
percent or $81 a tonne to $6,516.
 U.S. soybeans and grains futures also rose.

"
1393,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2010 08:34PM ET</span>",Yuan will not necessarily rise -official paper," BEIJING, June 21 (Reuters) - China's pledge to reform the
yuan does not necessarily mean that the currency will strengthen
against the dollar, state media reported on Monday, citing
Chinese economists.
 The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling
Communist Party, said the yuan would float both up and down
against the dollar and that one-way appreciation was not the
thrust of the reform.
 ""Going further with exchange rate reform does not necessarily
equate to renminbi appreciation,"" the newspaper said. The yuan is
also knowm as the renminbi.
 But the report also went to considerable lengths to explain
to the domestic public why currency reform could benefit the
country after months in which top leaders had said a stable yuan
was essential to the economy's health and that China would not be
bullied into ending a nearly two-year-old peg to the dollar.
 The central bank said on Saturday that China would gradually
increase the exchange rate's flexibility, an announcement that
looked timed to head off criticism from abroad a week before a
G20 summit in Canada.
 Global markets and policymakers will closely monitor the
Chinese yuan this week for signs that the central bank is
actually allowing the currency to rise after its statement was
widely understood as a promise to do so.
 Ba Shusong, a researcher with the Development Research
Centre, a think-tank under the cabinet, was quoted as saying that
the foundation for yuan appreciation had significantly weakened
because China's current account surplus accounted for a smaller
and smaller portion of gross domestic product.
 Ha Jiming, chief economist at China International Capital
Corp, the country's largest investment bank, was quoted as saying
that the yuan may fall against the dollar if the euro plunges
against the U.S. currency because the Chinese exchange rate would
refer to a basket of currencies.
 However, the People's Daily said that yuan reform would be a
good thing, giving China ""three benefits"".
 First, it would help push forward structural adjustment of
the Chinese economy, putting it on a path towards sustainable
development. Second, it would assist in controlling inflation and
asset bubbles.
 And third, the newspaper highlighted the broader political
gains from the move. ""It will help protect the period of
strategic opportunity and the international environment for our
country's economic development,"" it said.

 By Jason Subler and Lu Jianxin
 SHANGHAI, June 21 (Reuters) - China's yuan surged to a
five-year peak on Monday, sending stocks higher across the
globe as Beijing signaled ahead of this weekend's G20 summit
that it would deliver on pledges of greater currency
flexibility.
 China's central bank has maintained a de facto peg since
the middle of 2008, a controversial policy aimed at steadying
the world's fastest-growing major economy during the global
economic downturn.
 But the People's Bank of China (PBOC) stepped aside on
Monday to back up its surprise weekend announcement that it
would allow more flexibility for the yuan, buying some time
against critics who argue the currency is undervalued and gives
China an unfair advantage in trade.
 U.S. stocks climbed on Monday, mirroring gains on overseas
markets, as investors bet that China's currency move would
invigorate global economic recovery and raise long-term
prospects for U.S. multinationals.
 China's central bank, after setting the mid-point for
Monday's trading range, let the yuan rise 0.42 percent to
6.7976 per dollar -- both the biggest daily gain and the
highest close since China revalued the currency and introduced
a managed float regime in 2005.
 At one point, the yuan was up as much as 0.47 percent from
the day's mid-point -- just shy of the currency's 0.5 percent
limit, which had rarely been tested in practice in the past.
 Traders said the lack of intervention by the central bank
suggested it wanted the market to drive intraday trade and so
underline its weekend pledge.
 But it also showed it had ultimate control by setting the
reference rate, around which the yuan can trade, at the same
level as Friday's fixing.
 Traders said it was unlikely the yuan would repeat gains on
the same scale in coming days, with Tuesday's mid-point setting
serving as an important barometer of how much more appreciation
the central bank is willing to stomach.
 ""It is still too early to say what the PBOC is going to do
in the coming days but we expect the trend to be gradually
lower rather than volatile,"" said Callum Henderson, global head
of FX strategy at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.
 ""Tomorrow's fixing is awfully key in terms of the sentiment
of the market. One can pontificate on what is going to happen
based on one day, but frankly it is a guessing game on what is
going to happen. We will have to see the fixing tomorrow and
that should set the tone for the next couple of days.""
 China's economic strength gave policymakers confidence to
end the peg, but they remain worried demand for China's exports
is not on a solid footing given risks like Europe's debt woes.
 Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Yao Jian told the
official Xinhua news agency that yuan reform could put pressure
on exports initially, as firms were likely to face higher
material costs, but would yield long-term benefits.
 ""In the long run, however, export businesses would improve
business management and expand the industrial chain to make
themselves more competitive internationally,"" the agency
paraphrased Yao as saying.
 REMOVING AN IRRITANT
 The central bank ruled out a one-off revaluation of the
currency and suggested the yuan's value was close to fair
value.
 Still, analysts said China needs to show the G20, whose
leaders meet June 26-27 in Canada to discuss issues including
global trade imbalances, that it is serious in its commitment
to make the yuan more flexible.
 U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman called China's move
on the yuan a ""genuine attempt"" at currency reform and
predicted it could smooth sometimes testy relations between
Beijing and Washington.
 ""I think it takes an irritant off the table in the
U.S.-China relationship,"" Huntsman said following a speech in
Hong Kong.
 But some of China's strongest critics in the U.S. Congress
are unlikely to be impressed, and the United States itself has
called for ""vigorous implementation"" of the policy.
 Monday's gain in the yuan, small by comparison with freely
floating currencies, is likely to be enough to ease tensions at
the G20 summit, Ben Simpfendorfer, strategist with Royal Bank
of Scotland in Hong Kong, said in a note to clients.
 But tensions are likely to return following the summit, as
the scope of appreciation disappoints critics who complain
Beijing has used the peg to gain an unfair trade advantage.
 The PBOC's announcement at the weekend that it would give
the currency greater flexibility was welcomed globally, albeit
with some caution as policymakers waited to see what the words
would mean in practice.
 Markets, for their part, were optimistic. In the United
States, energy and materials shares led gains as commodities
were boosted by the move.
 ""It's a very large positive in the sense that the next
decade of global growth is probably going to be shaped by how
well the China consumer develops or doesn't, and obviously this
is a step to help that,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market
strategist at BTIG LLC in New York.
 Asian currencies and stocks rose and U.S. Treasuries fell
on expectations that China's promise to give the currency new
room to move would ease political tensions with the West and
encourage investors to snap up riskier assets.
 Commodities and oil also surged, as a stronger currency
would give the world's third-biggest economy more purchasing
power to buy foreign goods, which would be positive for world
trade, especially for commodity exporters such as Australia,
Brazil, Canada and New Zealand.
 Crude rose more than 1 percent, while copper and zinc
traded in Shanghai both rose by their daily limits.
 Many economists see the currency strengthening further in
coming days, but at a very modest pace, meaning some of
Monday's early exuberance could turn out to be overdone.
 A Reuters poll of 33 economists showed they expected the
yuan to end the year at 6.67 per dollar, a rise of 2.4 percent
from late last week before China's policy announcement and
similar to the appreciation implied by offshore non-deliverable
forwards.
 The central bank may also be keen in the months ahead to
increase the volatility of the yuan to discourage the hot-money
flows that accompanied its appreciation from 2005 to 2008.
 Economists say a higher yuan could help temper inflation in
China by pushing down import prices, which in turn could reduce
the need for Beijing to tighten monetary policy. Markets had
been worried that China could over-tighten and suffer a hard
landing.

 * Euro retreats to $1.23, vulnerable if yuan does not rise
 * Dollar index posts bullish reversal, more gains seen
 * 
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 22 (Reuters) - The euro was subdued on Tuesday
as investors anxiously waited to see how far and fast the Chinese
authorities would let their currency rise amid speculation any
appreciation would be slow at best.
 All eyes are on the yuan's mid-point fixing at 0115 GMT to
see whether the People's Bank of China would let it appreciate
from Monday's steady 6.8275 per dollar.
 The market took the yuan 0.42 percent higher on Monday, its
biggest one-day rise since the 2005 revaluation. But dealers fear
the central bank will not go nearly as far with the fixing rate,
which would likely weigh on the euro and commodity currencies.
 Doubts had already emerged overnight and erased most of the
euro's initial rally. On Tuesday, the euro  was at $1.2315,
having fallen from a one-month high of $1.2490.
 Near term support was seen at $1.2253, the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the rise from a 4-year low of $1.1875 on
June 7 to Monday's high of $1.2490.
 On the other hand, the dollar index <.DXY> was up at 85.94,
holding well above support at 85.13. The index posted a bullish
reversal day on Monday, suggesting more gains for the greenback
in the near term.
 Beijing's vow of flexibility on the yuan, which should boost
purchasing power and demand in the the world's third largest
economy, had initially fuelled a rally in risky assets on Monday.
 But the rally ebbed with not much follow-through buying, with
China's move undertaken primarily for political purposes,
analysts said. Leaders of the Group of 20 leading industrialized
and developing economies are to meet next week in Toronto, where
global trade imbalances are expected to be a key issue.
 China on Monday ruled out a one-off revaluation and said it
will reform its exchange rate regime in a gradual manner.
[ID:nBJC002566].
""The Chinese decision provided a welcoming short-term
distraction in a market gripped by fear and anxiety, but the
underlying European fiscal headaches and global growth
uncertainties remain unaltered,"" wrote Matthew Strauss, currency
strategist at RBC Capital.

RBC's Strauss added the euro's failure to break past
resistance near $1.25 was likely to result in a period for
weakness for the single currency. Against the yen, the euro was
steady at 112.20, having shed about 0.2 percent on Monday.
 The euro in recent months has moved with swings in risk
appetite. On Monday, the 25-day rolling correlation between the
euro and the S&P 500 <.SPX> was at a robust 54 percent.
 The fading risk rally was also evident in stock markets.
 The New Zealand  and Australian dollars ,
were off five-week highs.
 The Aussie , which had gained 1.4 percent in the
previous session, was at $0.8776, with support at $0.8750 --
Monday's low -- and strong resistance at Monday's $0.8860 high.
 The New Zealand dollar was up 0.16 percent at $0.7090, with
support at $0.7020 and resistance around $0.7153, the high on May
14.

1396,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2010 04:02PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Fin min: UK to dodge Greek fate with tough budget," * Osborne indicates capital gains tax rise, bank levy
 * Announces pension commission, payroll tax relief for some
 * Expected to freeze next year's England council tax
 
 (Adds council tax rise freeze)
 LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - The biggest threat to Britain's
economy is its huge budget deficit, and an emergency budget on
Tuesday will save the country from the fate of debt-stricken
Greece, British finance minister George Osborne said on Sunday.
 Measures expected to be included in the budget include a
bank levy and reform of welfare benefits and public sector pay.
Other plans include payroll tax breaks for new businesses, a
council tax freeze and a review of public sector pensions.
 ""You can see in Greece an example of a country that didn't
face up to its problems, and that is the fate that I want to
avoid,"" Osborne told the BBC in an interview.
 ""I'm absolutely clear, I don't want the question even asked,
'Can Britain pay its way in the world?' I'm going to prove on
Tuesday that we can,"" he said, adding that the budget's
austerity measures would be staggered over five years.
 Britain's budget deficit is at about 11 percent of national
output, and reducing the deficit is the centrepiece policy of
the new coalition government, made up of the centre-right
Conservative Party and centre-left Liberal Democrats.
 Tuesday's budget is expected to be the tightest in at least
30 years, and with public sector job losses and deep pay and
benefit cuts expected, the plan is likely to stoke public
discontent and strain the fledgling ruling alliance.
 Osborne indicated capital gains tax -- a tax on the sale of
assets such as real estate and shares -- would rise, despite
vigorous opposition from senior Conservative politicians.
 The levy is currently at 18 percent, and some workers switch
their income revenue, which is taxed at between 20 and 50
percent, to capital gains to pay less tax.
 ""Here is a tax where at the moment we see massive income tax

bank levy, aimed at clawing back billions paid by the state to
bail the financial sector out after the 2008 financial crisis.
 Countries are trying to coordinate to introduce new banking
rules in tandem to avoid regulation arbitrage, but progress so
far has been slow.
 ""The previous government didn't want a bank levy, because
they wanted every country in the world to sign up to one before
they would agree to one in Britain. I don't think that's fair,
and I'm going to ask the banks to pay a bank levy.""
 
 SWEETENERS
 One of the few sweeteners expected in the budget is a
payroll tax holiday for the first 10 employees hired by new
businesses outside Britain's southeast, government sources said.
 The maximum a business can claim per employee will be 5,000
pounds ($7,400) a year for those earning less than 44,800
pounds, a three-year scheme costing 900 million pounds and meant
to boost the economy in less prosperous parts of Britain.
 Sources familiar with Osborne's budget said he would also
tell local authorities in England not to raise council tax in
the 2011-2012 financial year.
 Osborne told the BBC he had set up a commission on public
service pensions, seen by some critics as too costly, to be
chaired by John Hutton, a former opposition Labour party cabinet
minister, a move meant to produce a non-partisan review.
 The commission will produce an interim report in September,
and a final report in time for next year's budget.
 Critics of deep spending cuts soon say it puts Britain at
risk of a ""double dip"" recession, just as it emerges from its
worst recession since World War Two.
 A ComRes poll for the Independent on Sunday found support
for Britain's three main political parties largely unchanged
since the May 6 general election, but showed divisions over some
possible austerity measures.
 Most of those polled last week agreed child benefits should
be withdrawn from wealthier people, 48 percent agreed they would
rather pay higher income tax than see public services cut, and
49 percent disagreed that the government was exaggerating
financial problems to justify public sector cuts.

 * Says needs to be vigilant about inflation

(Adds details and background)
 ABU DHABI, June 20 (Reuters) - Jordan's central bank does
not plan to change the composition of its $11 billion foreign
exchange reserves and it needs to be vigilant due to advancing
inflation, Governor Umayya Toukan said on Sunday.
 Jordanian officials have been insisting for the last two
years they had no plans to change the composition of the
oil-importing country's currency reserves. 
 ""It will not change. I do not think countries should rush to
take such important decisions on daily rates,"" he told reporters
after signing a loan agreement in the United Arab Emirates. ""We
will see for one or two years before taking action.""
 Jordan's reserves, which are denominated in the dollar and
cover over six months imports, are nearly 70 percent in the
greenback and 30 percent in euros, gold and other currencies.
 Weakness of the euro following the European debt crisis has
recently turned the global market focus to reserve management.
 The euro hovered near a three-week high against the dollar
on Friday as European leaders said they would publish details
about the health of European banks.
 The Jordanian dinar is pegged to the dollar, a policy which
the authorities say has served the national economy well.
 The central bank (CBJ) has traditionally maintained high
interest rates to preserve attractiveness of dinar assets and to
hamper any excessive capital outflow into dollar assets.
 It usually ensures a differential between dinar and dollar
rates of around at least four percent to stem capital flight.
 Toukan declined to comment on interest rate outlook but said
the central bank needed to be on guard due to rising consumer
prices.
 ""We are watching inflation and we should be vigilant about
it,"" he said.
Annual inflation in the kingdom accelerated to 5.2 percent
year-on-year in May from 4.9 percent in April, helped by rising
energy costs. 
 Economists expect average inflation to rise to 5 percent in
2010 from 2-3 percent last year.
 The central bank embarked on monetary policy easing at the
end of 2008 to mitigate the impact of the global downturn on the
country's sluggish economy. It cut benchmark interest rates by
50 basis points in February.

 * Announces pension commission, payroll tax relief for some
 
 (Corrects maximum payroll tax break size in paragraph 14)
 LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - The biggest threat to Britain's
economy is its huge budget deficit, and an emergency budget on
Tuesday will save the country from the fate of debt-stricken
Greece, British finance minister George Osborne said on Sunday.
 Measures expected to be included in the budget include a pay
freeze for Britain's six-million-strong public sector, a bank
levy and welfare benefit reform. Other plans include payroll tax
breaks for new businesses and reform of public sector pensions.
 ""You can see in Greece an example of a country that didn't
face up to its problems, and that is the fate that I want to
avoid,"" Osborne told the BBC in an interview.
 ""I'm absolutely clear, I don't want the question even asked,
'Can Britain pay its way in the world?' I'm going to prove on
Tuesday that we can,"" he said, adding that the budget's
austerity measures would be staggered over five years.
 Britain's budget deficit is at about 11 percent of national
output, and reducing the deficit is the centrepiece policy of
the new coalition government, made up of the centre-right
Conservative Party and centre-left Liberal Democrats.
 Tuesday's budget is expected to be the tightest in at least
30 years, and with public sector job losses and deep pay and
benefit cuts expected, the plan is likely to stoke public
discontent and strain the fledgling ruling alliance.
 Osborne indicated capital gains tax -- a tax on the sale of
assets such as real estate and shares -- would rise, despite
vigorous opposition from senior Conservative politicians.
 The levy is currently at 18 percent, and some workers switch
their income revenue, which is taxed at between 20 and 50
percent, to capital gains to pay less tax.
 ""Here is a tax where at the moment we see massive income tax
evasion, we see people shifting their income ... and that's not
fair given the current situation, so we'll deal with that,""
Osborne said, without saying by how much the levy will rise.

yuan more flexible, signalling that it was ready to break a
23-month-old peg to the dollar that had come under intense
international criticism.

improve mechanisms of saving its indebted members, ECB
Governing Council member Marko Kranjec told Slovenian daily
Dnevnik in an interview published in its weekend edition.
 He also said the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to
start buying government bonds was ""autonomous"" and added the
ECB has in the past shown that it ""can act very quickly if
necessary"".
 He said the financial crisis showed that banks needed to be
more regulated and forecast that a special tax on banks will be
introduced in the future. He also said other countries would
follow Germany by prohibiting naked short-selling but gave no
details.
 ""The EU is a political and economic project and I am sure
that Europe without the union would not be an important player
on the world market,"" Kranjec said.
 ""If it is worth saving the union, it is worth saving every
one of its members but saving mechanisms have to be improved.
The EU project demands tough negotiations as countries did not
hand over their national sovereignity to the EU.""
 He said the ECB decided to start buying government bonds
because it was difficult to ensure adequate financing for
member states in which markets did not have sufficient trust or
lacked knowledge on them.
 He added the ECB would shortly form a body for European
risk management to improve its actions on financial stability
and prevent ""systemic financial crises"".
He said the EU and its central banks would also establish an
independent risk rating institution which shows ""lack of trust
in commercial credit rating firms"".
 Kranjec also said the consequences of the financial crisis
would be much worse if states had not saved financially
troubled banks but added that banks will in the future pay
their bill, too.
 ""There is talk of a new special tax on banks and I think
such a tax will be introduced."" He added more bank regulation
was needed.
 Kranjec, who is also the governor of the Slovenian central
bank, said Slovenian banks had enough capital ""at present"",
although the value of bad loans had increased and represented
some 2.5 percent of total banks' investments.
 He said Slovenian banks now had to deal with the problems
of the real economy, particularly construction, where companies
have troubles returning loans.
 Slovenia, which was the fastest growing euro zone member
before the recession, was badly hit by the global crisis due to
dependency on exports and its economy contracted by 7.8 percent
in 2009 while a mild recovery is seen this year.

 SINGAPORE, June 20 (Reuters) - Commodity markets are likely
to rise on Monday after China vowed to make its currency more
flexible, but traders added the move would probably support raw
material and grain prices more than energy.
 Although China made clear on Saturday that a one-off step
change in its exchange rate similar to 2005 was not on the
cards, analysts expect the yuan to rise slowly, adding to its
nearly 20 percent gain since its last revaluation in 2005.
 Analysts have talked about a rise in the order of 5-10
percent in the yuan over the year, effectively making imported
raw materials less expensive for Chinese buyers.
 ""This will tempt speculators back into the market on the
long side. Most of our markets are highly geared to Chinese
demand and anything that encourages Chinese buying will be
positive,"" a trader in Singapore said.
 ""Look for the biggest reaction in markets like base metals
and iron ore where China is the dominant consumer and heavily
reliant on imports. In a market like oil, I don't think we will
see as great a response.""
 He noted the weakness in base metals -- copper prices have
fallen by a fifth since mid-April-- may be seen as an
opportunity too good to pass up.
 ""This creates additional arbitrage opportunities and
generally lifts the upside risk outlook. We could be good for a
2-3 percent pop early next week,"" he added.
 Benchmark London Metal Exchange copper  closed at
$6,435 a tonne on Friday, down $11 on the day and well off the
mid-April just above $8,000, undermined by worries about the
euro zone debt crisis and slowing growth rates in China.
 Major Chilean copper miner Antofagasta Minerals 
also saw a stronger yuan helping boost demand of the metal in
China.
 Fred Demler, head of commodities for MF Global, said:
""Should be a positive, as it was in prior years.""
 When China raised its exchange rate in 2005, by 2.1
percent, commodities rallied for more than a year after the
revaluation, although not solely because of Beijing's move.
 Last year, China spent around 607 billion yuan ($89
billion) on importing oil, 343 billion yuan ($50 billion) on
iron ore and 206 billion yuan ($30 billion) on copper.
 SAVINGS ON COMMODITY PURCHASES
 An increase of 3 percent in the yuan would have saved the
nation some 56 billion yuan ($8.21 billion) on its commodity
purchases, or enough to buy more than 1 million tonnes of
copper.
 In grain markets, soybean prices may rally - China buys
around half of the soy sold on the international market.
Chicago Board of Trade November soy, which has replaced July as
the lead contract, ended Friday 5-½ cents higher at $9.30-½
per bushel after reaching $9.35, its highest level in a month.
 Traders said the yuan move would add to positive sentiment
the market is currently seeing from U.S. weather worries and
confirmation that exporters sold 120,000 tonnes of U.S.
soybeans to an unknown destination for 2010/11 delivery.
 Traders speculated the sale could be earmarked for China.
 Other markets were also expected to see support, but the
nation, the world's second biggest oil consumer, only buys 1 in
10 of the world's barrels of crude, as against more than 40
percent of global copper supply.
 In addition, the scope of gains for oil prices might be
limited because of Chinese price controls of fuel and the
nation's status as an exporter of oil products, which may be
undermined by a stronger yuan.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2010 04:50PM ET</span>",China forex move could thwart U.S. hopes - Roubini," By Walden Siew
 NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - China's decision to move away
from its currency peg might mean the yuan weakens against the
dollar instead of strengthens as Washington wants, Nouriel
Roubini, one of Wall Street's most closely followed economists,
said on Saturday.
 China said on Saturday it would gradually make the yuan
more flexible after pegging it to the dollar for nearly two
years, a move that the U.S. government and others around the
world have long been calling for.
 ""This is the first significant signal in years of a change
in Chinese currency policy,"" Roubini, best known for having
predicted the U.S. housing meltdown, told Reuters.
 But it remains to be seen how China would put the new
system into practice including the composition of a basket of
currencies that Beijing will use as a reference point for the
yuan -- also known as the renminbi -- and the base date for
that basket, he said in an e-mail.
 ""Since they have not changed the previous range for the
band -- plus or minus 0.5 percent -- most likely on Monday
China will allow the renminbi vs U.S. dollar to move,"" said
Roubini.
 The yuan has risen sharply in recent months against the
euro, which sank over Europe's debt problems, so a stronger
yuan could not be taken for granted, he said.
 If the euro were to continue to depreciate, ""the renminbi
would have to be allowed to depreciate relative to the dollar,
a paradoxical outcome,"" Roubini said.
 His comments echoed those of an adviser to China's central
bank on Saturday.
 Li Daokui, an academic adviser to the monetary policy
committee of the People's Bank of China, told Reuters in
Beijing that the yuan could depreciate against the dollar if
the euro falls sharply against the U.S. currency.
 Roubini, like other analysts, said a major strengthening of
the yuan looked unlikely.
 ""Even if the Chinese were to allow a gradual renminbi
appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar, the size of such
appreciation would be modest over the next year, not more than
3 or 4 percent as the trade surplus has shrunk, growth is
likely to slow down on China and labor/employment unrest
remains of concern to the Chinese.""

 * Words alone not enough to defuse fight in Congress
(Adds US-China Business Council comment, paragraphs 18-19)
 By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - China's unexpected pledge
on Saturday to allow its currency to rise more rapidly will
probably make for a less contentious meeting with Group of 20
world leaders in Toronto next week.
 Unless Beijing swiftly follows up talk with action,
however, the vow will not defuse a fight brewing in the U.S.
Congress over whether to penalize China for what some lawmakers
see as unfair trade practices.
 China's central bank said it would gradually make the
yuan's exchange rate more flexible, indicating it was ready to
break a 23-month-old dollar peg that had become a growing
source of friction with the United States. ([ID:nTOE64C02B])
 Washington wants a stronger yuan to make its own exports
more competitive with China's. Many economists say the yuan is
undervalued by as much as 40 percent, giving China a trading
advantage and swelling its reserves to more than $2 trillion.
 ""This is an important step but the test is how far and how
fast they let the currency appreciate,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary
Timothy Geithner said in a statement.
 Some private analysts doubted China would act quickly.
 ""Just these words are not going to be enough to satisfy the
U.S. Congress and Treasury,"" said Marc Chandler, head of global
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co in New York.
 ""I am skeptical. I am not convinced that these words mean
what they seem to mean.""
 U.S. Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who has led a
congressional charge to get tougher on China, called the move
""vague and limited"" and typical of China's response to
pressure.
 ""Until there is more specific information about how quickly
it will let its currency appreciate and by how much, we can
have no good feeling that the Chinese will start playing by the
rules,"" Schumer said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters.
 STEALING G20's THUNDER
 Just one day earlier, it appeared the yuan dispute was
nearing boiling point after Beijing said its currency had no
place on the agenda at the G20 meeting.
 U.S. President Barack Obama released a sharply worded
letter to his G20 colleagues saying that free-floating
currencies were ""essential"" for global economic stability.
 ""China has once again stolen the thunder from the
international community by timing its announcement of a move
towards greater exchange rate flexibility right before the G20
meeting,"" said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution think tank in Washington.
 ""The big question is whether this is a symbolic move or a
true shift in China's currency policy that will result in
significant currency appreciation in the near term.
 On Saturday, Obama called China's decision a ""constructive
step"" that can help safeguard the recovery and contribute to
more balanced growth.
 The International Monetary Fund called the yuan
announcement a welcome development that would help China
reorient its economy toward domestic demand.
 A stronger yuan would promote U.S. exports to China and
""strengthen what is already a positive and beneficial trade
relationship between the two nations,"" said Rich Lavin, group
president for emerging markets at heavy equipment maker
Caterpillar Inc.
 China Business Council, whose members do business in China,
said it supported allowing the exchange rate to better reflect
market influences.
 ""China's growing exports and inflation concerns suggest
that China's exchange rate should strengthen,"" USCBC President
John Frisbie said in a statement. ""We look forward to seeing
how the People's Bank of China will implement their statement
of today.""
 NO MORE MR. NICE GUY
 Obama's administration has relied on quiet diplomacy to
nudge China into unpegging its currency, much to the
frustration of some lawmakers who thought the White House was
too soft on an increasingly aggressive competitor.
 Geithner delayed a report to Congress due in April in which
Washington had to decide whether it would label China a
currency manipulator, a step that could trigger an IMF review
and no doubt anger Beijing.
 Geithner had essentially offered China a grace period
through the Toronto G20 meetings, and many economists thought
he would affix the label in the coming weeks.
 It appeared that Washington and Beijing had at least an
implicit agreement earlier this year that China would allow the
yuan to rise more rapidly, said Menzie Chinn, a China policy
scholar who teaches economics at the University of Wisconsin.
 Europe's worsening debt troubles put that on hold. Europe
is China's largest trading partner, so China had no desire to
do anything that would further harm demand.
 ""The impending G20 meeting required at least some sort of
indication of impending action,"" Chinn said.
 ""Saying that they will allow 'flexibility' means they can
also try to occasionally depreciate the yuan on a day-to-day
basis, here and there, to discourage speculators gambling on
predictable day-by-day appreciation.""
 But that will probably not be enough to calm tensions among
U.S. lawmakers who want to penalize China.
 Unless China gets more specific in the next few days, ""we
will have no choice but to move forward with our legislation,""
Schumer said.

WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
on Saturday welcomed China's announcement that it would resume
exchange rate reform to make its yuan currency more flexible.
""China's decision to increase the flexibility of its
exchange rate is a constructive step that can help safeguard

 Beijing said earlier that in light of the gradual recovery
in the global economy, and as the recovery and upturn in the
Chinese economy has become more solid, it wanted to proceed
with currency reform and to make the yuan more flexible.

by extolling the benefits of market-determined exchange rates
in a letter to G20 leaders before their summit in Canada on
June 26-27.
The Group of 20 top industrial powers agreed at their last
gathering in Pittsburgh to strengthen the global economy by
rebalancing demand. This was a clear reference to countries
like China, which critics say boost exports by manipulating
their exchange rate to keep them artificially low.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2010 12:26PM ET</span>","FACTBOX-US current, proposed law on currency manipulation"," June 19 (Reuters) - China's central bank said it will
gradually make the yuan's exchange rate more flexible,
signaling a resumption of its rise in value and an end to a
nearly 2-year-old peg to the dollar.
 The move seemed intended to deflect growing criticism of
Beijing's currency policies before a G20 leaders summit in
Canada. [ID:nTOE65I01K] But it did little to placate key
members of Congress, who still threatened to push ahead with
new legislation that would impose punitive duties on China if
the yuan fails to rise.
 Senator Charles Schumer called the People's Bank of China's
announcement a ""vague and limited statement of intentions"" and
Congress would have no choice but to proceed with the
legislation without more specific details and action from
Beijing. He is hoping for a vote in the next two weeks.
 The bill proposed by Schumer, fellow Democratic Senator
Debbie Stabenow and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, would
repeal a 1988 law to curb currency manipulation and lower the
threshold for punitive action on currencies found to be
""fundamentally misaligned."" [ID:nN1699515]
 Following are details of the existing law and the proposed
Schumer-Stabenow-Graham Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Act of
2010:
CURRENT LAW
-- The U.S. Treasury Department, in consultation with the
International Monetary Fund, shall analyze the exchange rate
policies of foreign countries on an annual basis.
-- Semiannual reports are due April 15 and Oct. 15.
-- The reports examine whether countries are manipulating
their currency's exchange rate with the U.S. dollar ""for
purposes of preventing effective balance of payments
adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in
international trade.""
-- If manipulation is found, the Treasury secretary shall
""initiate negotiations with such foreign countries on an
expedited basis, in the International Monetary Fund or
bilaterally, for the purpose of ensuring that such countries
regularly and promptly adjust the rate of exchange between
their currencies and the United States dollar.""
-- The secretary ""shall not be required to initiate
negotiations in cases where such negotiations would have a
serious detrimental impact on vital national economic and
security interests.""
-- In such cases, the secretary must notify leaders of the
Senate Banking Committee and the House of Representatives'
Financial Services Committee of his decision.
The authorizing statute:
http://www.treasury.gov/offices/international-affairs/economic-exchange-rates/authorizing-statute.pdf
LATEST PROPOSAL
-- Treasury under the Schumer-Stabenow-Graham bill would be
required to drop its ""manipulation"" criteria in favor of
determining whether a currency is ""fundamentally misaligned""
based on objective criteria or clear policy action from the
relevant government. [ID:nN16143620]
-- The latter designation would trigger a priority
investigation from the U.S. Commerce Department as to whether
the undervaluation is an unfair subsidy for that country's
exports at the expense of U.S. industry. It must then impose
import duties to counteract the subsidy.
-- Treasury would be required to immediately consult with
all countries with misaligned currencies and engage the
International Monetary Fund in priority cases. In the case of
China, the IMF said on March 1 that the yuan was ""substantially
undervalued"" from a medium-term perspective.
-- After 90 days of the designated country's failure to make
appropriate policies, the U.S. must incorporate the currency
undervaluation into its dumping calculations for products from
that country. Federal purchases of goods and services from the
country would be prohibited unless the country is a member of
the World Trade Organization's Government Procurement Agreement
-- a provision aimed squarely at China. It would forbid
Overseas Private Investment Corp financing and oppose
multilateral development bank financing for projects in the
designated country.
 -- After 360 days of failure to adopt appropriate policies,
the U.S. Trade Representative must request WTO dispute
settlement consultations with the designated country. The U.S.
Treasury would be required to consult with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks to consider remedial intervention in
currency markets.
 -- The U.S. president could put the process on hold after
the initial 90 days of inaction if he determined that it would
harm national security or the economic interests of the United
States, but this must be explained and could be overridden by a
congressional disapproval resolution.
 -- The bill would create a new body that the Treasury must
consult while developing its report. Eight of the nine members
would be chosen by Congress.
 PREVIOUS CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS AT REVAMP
-- Many U.S. lawmakers have called for changes because
Treasury has historically been reluctant to label countries
currency manipulators, particularly China. However, there has
not been a serious push to revamp the law since 2007.
-- Some lawmakers have proposed giving Treasury less
discretion in citing countries when certain conditions are met;
others wanted the U.S. government to adopt what they consider
more neutral language in its semi-annual reports.
-- The Senate Finance Committee passed legislation in 2007
that would have required Treasury to identify countries with
""fundamentally misaligned"" currencies but action on the bill
stalled, partly because of a jurisdictional battle with the
Senate Banking Committee.

 BRUSSELS, June 19 (Reuters) - European leaders welcomed a
move by China on Saturday to make its yuan exchange rate more
""flexible"" saying it would be positive for China and the world
economy and help correct global imbalances.
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the move was
""encouraging"" and the European Union's executive said the
expected reforms to the exchange rate of the yuan (also known as
the renminbi or RMB) should have positive repercussions for the
euro zone.
 ""The European Commission welcomes The People's Bank of China
decision to proceed further with the reform of the RMB exchange
rate regime and to resume the RMB exchange rate flexibility,"" it
said in a statement.
 ""It considers that such a move will be beneficial for both
the Chinese economy and the global economy. The European
Commission looks forward to work closely with the Chinese
authorities bilaterally and in the G20 to address successfully
the current challenges to the global recovery.""
 Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin also welcomed the
move but said that it would not have much impact on Russia's
economy or trade between the two emerging economies.
 ""It will not affect us for now, although on the whole it is
positive,"" Kudrin said. ""It will not affect our trade
significantly.""
 China's announcement, which comes a week before the G20
group of the world's leading economies meets in Canada to
discuss global imbalances, suggests the country is ready to
break the yuan's 23-month-old informal peg to the dollar.
 The decision is not likely to lead to a one-off revaluation
or major appreciation in the yuan, but it will be seen as a
positive move by China at a sensitive time for global finance.
 Whether the announcement will be enough to placate critics,
especially U.S. lawmakers who say an undervalued currency gives
China an unfair trade advantage, remains to be seen.
 ""This implementation of the decision will help achieve more
sustainable growth in the global economy, contribute to reduce
external imbalances and strengthen the stability of the
international monetary and financial system,"" the European
Commission said.
 ""It sends a signal of confidence on the strength of the
global recovery at a time when downside risks have increased.""
 The Commission's statement added that it would also ""entail
positive effects"" for the euro area. 
 ""By enhancing the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate, the
Chinese authorities are providing an important contribution to
the success of the G20 Toronto Summit,"" the statement said.
 Speaking at the same Russian forum as Kudrin and Sarkozy,
International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky
added: ""This will be taken as a very positive move forward (by

 By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - China's unexpected pledge
on Saturday to allow its currency to rise more rapidly will
probably make for a less contentious meeting with Group of 20
world leaders in Toronto next week.
 Unless Beijing swiftly follows up talk with action,
however, the vow won't defuse a fight brewing in the U.S.
Congress over whether to penalize China for what some lawmakers
see as unfair trade practices.
 China's central bank said it would gradually make the
yuan's exchange rate more flexible, indicating it was ready to
break a 23-month-old dollar peg that had become a growing
source of friction with the United States. ([ID:nTOE64C02B])
 Washington wants a stronger yuan to make its own exports
more competitive with China's. Many economists say the yuan is
undervalued by as much as 40 percent, giving China a trading
advantage and swelling its reserves to more than $2 trillion.
 ""Just these words are not going to be enough to satisfy the
U.S. Congress and Treasury,"" said Marc Chandler, head of global
currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co in New York.
 ""I am skeptical. I am not convinced that these words mean
what they seem to mean.""
 U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat who has led a
congressional charge to get tougher on China, called the move
""vague and limited"" and typical of China's response to
pressure.
 ""Until there is more specific information about how quickly
it will let its currency appreciate and by how much, we can
have no good feeling that the Chinese will start playing by the
rules,"" Schumer said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters.
 STEALING G20's THUNDER
 Just one day earlier, it appeared the yuan dispute was
nearing boiling point after Beijing said its currency had no
place on the agenda at next week's G20 meeting.
 U.S. President Barack Obama released a sharply worded
letter to his G20 colleagues saying that free-floating
currencies were ""essential"" for global economic stability.
 ""China has once again stolen the thunder from the
international community by timing its announcement of a move
towards greater exchange rate flexibility right before the G20
meeting,"" said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution think tank in Washington.
 ""The big question is whether this is a symbolic move or a
true shift in China's currency policy that will result in
significant currency appreciation in the near term.
 On Saturday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
welcomed the shift in tone and said he looked forward to
working with China in the G20 and bilaterally.
 ""Vigorous implementation would make a positive contribution
to strong and balanced growth,"" he said in a statement.
 The International Monetary Fund called the yuan
announcement a welcome development that would help China
reorient its economy toward domestic demand.
 NO MORE MR. NICE GUY
 Obama's administration has relied on quiet diplomacy to
nudge China into unpegging its currency, much to the
frustration of some lawmakers who thought the White House was
too soft on an increasingly aggressive competitor.
 Geithner delayed a report to Congress due in April in which
Washington had to decide whether it would label China a
currency manipulator, a step that could trigger an IMF review
and no doubt anger Beijing.
 Geithner had essentially offered China a grace period
through the Toronto G20 meetings, and many economists thought
he would affix the label in the coming weeks.
 It appeared that Washington and Beijing had at least an
implicit agreement earlier this year that China would allow the
yuan to rise more rapidly, said Menzie Chinn, a China policy
scholar who teaches economics at the University of Wisconsin.
 Europe's worsening debt troubles put that on hold. Europe
is China's largest trading partner, so China had no desire to
do anything that would further harm demand.
 ""The impending G20 meeting required at least some sort of
indication of impending action,"" Chinn said.
 ""Saying that they will allow 'flexibility' means they can
also try to occasionally depreciate the yuan on a day-to-day
basis, here and there, to discourage speculators gambling on
predictable day-by-day appreciation.""
 But this will probably not be enough to calm tensions among
U.S. lawmakers who have been pressing for rules laws that would
penalize China for unfair trade practices.
 Unless China gets more specific in the next few days, ""we
will have no choice but to move forward with our legislation,""
Schumer said.

 Geithner had taken a softer approach toward China on the

 * But central bank says no basis for big changes
 * Likely to have small movements through daily rate
 By Michael Wei and Benjamin Kang Lim
 BEIJING, June 19 (Reuters) - China will gradually make the
yuan's exchange rate more flexible, the central bank said on
Saturday, indicating that it was ready to break a 23-month-old
dollar peg that has come under intense fire from abroad.
 The People's Bank of China all but ruled out the one-off
revaluation or major appreciation hoped for by critics, saying
there was ""no basis for big fluctuations or changes"" in the
exchange rate.
 However, it was clear that China intended its announcement --
published in English at around the same time as Chinese, a
departure from usual practice -- to mark the end of the yuan's de
facto peg to the dollar, which it had defended as a ""special
policy"" to protect its economy from the global financial crisis.
 Whether the announcement will be enough to placate critics,
especially U.S. lawmakers who say an undervalued currency gives
China an unfair trade advantage, remains to be seen.
 ""The global economy is gradually recovering. The recovery and
upturn of the Chinese economy has become more solid with enhanced
economic stability,"" the Chinese central bank said in a statement
on its website.
 ""It is desirable to proceed further with reform of RMB
exchange rate regime and increase the RMB exchange rate
flexibility,"" it said. The yuan is also know as the renminbi, or
RMB.
 In practice, this is likely to mean that the central bank
will use its system of setting daily reference rates for the yuan
to guide the currency back to a path of gradual appreciation
against the dollar, which it followed for three years until
mid-2008.
 Initial movements will probably be small, but cumulatively,
it could amount to several percentage points over the next few
months.
 International complaints about China's exchange rate policy
had died down in recent months as the European sovereign debt
crisis became the dominant concern, but in recent days pressure
had begun to mount again.
 A group of U.S. lawmakers, led by Senator Charles Schumer,
were pushing for a bill that would allow the United States to use
countervailing duties against countries with ""fundamentally
misaligned"" exchange rates.
 And the yuan was threatening to be the elephant in the room
at a G20 summit in Canada on June 26 and 27. U.S. President
Barack Obama said that it was essential to global economic
vitality that countries adopt market-oriented exchange rates, but
a series of Chinese officials said the yuan was China's sovereign
concern and should not be discussed in international circles.
 China has held the yuan at roughly 6.83 to the dollar since
July 2008 in an attempt to insulate the fastest-growing major
economy from the ravages of the global financial crisis.

 * Funding adequate if further eurozone assistance needed
 * Hungary in talks for more support, time frame unclear
 By Melissa Akin and Kiryl Sukhotski
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 19 (Reuters) - Some of Spain's
small regional savings banks may need assistance but pose no
threat to the success of the country's new austerity measures,
the deputy managing director of the IMF said on Saturday.
 ""Certainly the caixas in Spain and other places have had
some difficulty,"" John Lipsky told Reuters Insider in an
interview at the St Petersburg economic forum.
 ""The size should be kept in mind. There is no reason to
think these issues would derail the broad pace of policy
reform."" He added, ""Certain institutions may require specific
steps to address their problems.""
 The fund has thrown its support behind Spain's hastily
imposed austerity measures and labour market reforms, helping to
dispel worries the country could have to tap a 500 billion euro
emergency fund for a Greek style bailout.
 The fund has applauded Spain's readiness to publicise
'stress tests' to put on display the health of its banks, a
measure Lipsky said would soothe investor fears.
 Lipsky said funding was ample for additional support
measures in Europe if required. The fund is in talks with
Hungary about a new economic support programme in addition to a
20 billion euro IMF-led package already in place.
 ""We are in discussions,"" Lipsky said. ""It is an open
question, the period ... which a programme would cover.""
 He said the fund also had a staff mission in the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev to meet the government of newly elected
President Viktor Yanukovich and assess its policies before
deciding on new aid to follow last year's package.
 It is seeking a new $19 billion loan. A $16.4 billion
facility was suspended last year on grounds of lack of fiscal
restraint.
 ""The runup to the election created a political stalemate

 SHANGHAI, June 19 (Reuters) - The budget deficit of
debt-stricken Greece is declining and will meet its target,
Economy Minister Louka Katseli said on Saturday, adding that she
was optimistic of seeing some resumption of growth in 2011.
 A Greek newspaper also cited central bank chief George
Provopoulos as saying that current budget performance shows
Athens may beat its target under a deal with the EU and IMF,
cutting this year's deficit to 8 percent of GDP or less, from
13.6 percent in 2009.
 ""I am optimistic that in 2011 we will have a resumption of
growth and actually enhance our competitiveness which is a major
challenge for the Greek economy,"" Economy Minister Louka Katseli
said.
 She was in Shanghai to attend Greece's national day
celebrations at the World Expo.
 Under the terms of a 110 billion euro aid for pain deal with
the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, Greece
has promised to cut its budget gap to 8.1 percent of GDP this
year and bring it under the EU's 3 percent limit by 2014.
 A delegation from the European Union, IMF and European
Central Bank said on Thursday Greece seemed on track with
reforms aimed at rescuing it from bankruptcy.
 Katseli said pressures on Greek consumer inflation, which
hit 13-year highs at 5.5 percent in May, were also set to ease.
 ""We think this will be absorbed by the market and sooner or
later you will see a slowing down of price hikes as the economy
stabilises and the economy turns around,"" she said.
 
 CHINA STEPS IN?
 Katseli said the cash-strapped country was looking to China
to increase investment in its shipping, tourism and commerce
industries.
 When asked if Greece was open to investment in other areas,
such as banks, state railways OSE, and the Hellenic Post, the
minister told reporters Greece had presented all projects.
 ""I know the Chinese are interested in all the projects
Greece has to offer,"" she said.
 ""There is an active interest on the part of (Chinese) state
companies and others to invest in infrastructure projects in
Greece,"" she said.
 Katseli said Greece was seeking collaboration with China's
Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], the world's second-largest mobile
gear maker, to expand ICT development between the two countries.
She said she would visit the company in Shanghai on Sunday but
did not give further details.
 
 GLOBAL POWERS
 Earlier on Saturday, Katseli said in a speech that a deal
with China's Cosco <600428.SS>, one of the world's largest
container shipping firms, highlighted the opportunities for
China in Greece.
 ""We want to increase cooperation in the field of shipping,
where Greece and China are global powers,"" she said speaking
through a translator.
 Katseli's speech follows a visit this week by China's Vice
Premier Zhang Dejiang to Athens, where Chinese and Greek firms
signed shipbuilding and construction deals worth hundreds of
millions of euros.
 Cosco last month said it would go ahead with a concession
deal signed in 2008, to upgrade and run port facilities for up
to 35 years at Greece's biggest port of Piraeus, (OLP)
. The deal is worth 3.4 billion euros ($4.21 billion),
OLP said.
 China's Cosco President and CEO Wei Jiafu, who attended the
celebration activities throughout the day, told guests in the
Greek pavilion: ""Cosco wishes to see more Chinese companies
invest in Greece and bring their goods and service to central
Europe through the port of Piraeus, creating more opportunities
for the local economy.""
 Greece, which already has two of its major ports listed on
the local stock exchange, will look to list its other ports with
details to be released later this year.
 ""The majority stake will remain under state authority, 51
percent, but we think that we can bring in new capital, fresh
capital into port development and development of port services
through the stock exchange,"" Katseli said.

 * Caixas' small size would limit impact

 * Hungary in talks for more support, time frame unclear
 By Melissa Akin and Kiryl Sukhotski
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 19 (Reuters) - Some of Spain's
small regional savings banks may need assistance but pose no
threat to the success of the country's new austerity measures,
the deputy managing director of the IMF said on Saturday.
 ""Certainly the caixas in Spain and other places have had
some difficulty,"" John Lipsky told Reuters Insider in an
interview at the St Petersburg economic forum.
 ""The size should be kept in mind. There is no reason to
think these issues would derail the broad pace of policy
reform."" He added, ""Certain institutions may require specific
steps to address their problems.""
 The fund has thrown its support behind Spain's hastily
imposed austerity measures and labour market reforms, helping
to dispel worries the country could have to tap a 500 billion
euro emergency fund for a Greek style bailout.
 The fund has applauded Spain's readiness to publicise
""stress tests"" to put on display the health of its banks, a
measure Lipsky said would soothe investor fears.
 Lipsky said funding was ample for additional support
measures in Europe if required. The fund is in talks with
Hungary about a new economic support programme in addition to a
20 billion euro IMF-led package already in place.
 ""We are in discussions,"" Lipsky said. ""It is an open
question, the period ... which a programme would cover.""
 He said the fund also had a staff mission in the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev to meet the government of newly elected
President Viktor Yanukovich and assess its policies before
deciding on new aid to follow last year's package.
 It is seeking a new $19 billion loan. A $16.4 billion
facility was suspended last year on grounds of lack of fiscal
restraint.
 ""The runup to the election created a political stalemate
that froze policies,"" he said. ""Now the government is in place
and is forming its policies and we are exactly in discussion
about those policies.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - World stocks gained for a
ninth straight day on Friday on improved risk appetite after a
Spanish bond auction eased fears about sovereign debt in Europe
and helped the euro hold near three-week highs.
 U.S. and European shares retraced all their losses for the
year as banks in Europe gained even as questions arose over a
pledge by European Union leaders to publish details of ""stress
tests"" on the health of banks that have been under pressure
from lingering worries about the sovereign debt they hold.For
details see: [ID:nLDE65H142]
 Some analysts said the tests to be published in July would
boost investor confidence in European banks.
 U.S. stocks ground higher in light trade, with major
indexes posting a strong week even though housing and labor
market data showed signs of a fragile recovery. But the S&P 500
closed above its 200-day moving average for a third straight
session, which suggests resilience.
 For the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 each gained 2.4
percent and the Nasdaq added 3 percent.
 ""A positive day, but there is still a lot of resistance on
the top side,"" said Phil Roberts, technical analyst at Barclays
Capital. ""It has come a long way without a correction so next
week the market may struggle.
 ""But in the bigger picture if it continues to consolidate
above the 200-day moving average we could see further gains.""
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained
almost 0.3 percent. The index has rebounded around 7 percent
since its June 7 close and gained about 3 percent this week.
 The world index was helped by European shares, which rose
for the eighth consecutive session. It was the longest winning
streak in 11 months.
 MSCI's emerging markets counterpart <.MSCIEF> outperformed
and was up almost 0.7 percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 16.47
points, or 0.16 percent, to 10,450.64. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> rose 1.47 points, or 0.13 percent, to
1,117.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> added 2.64 points,
or 0.11 percent, to 2,309.80.
 Energy shares helped support the Dow and S&P, with some
investors betting that stocks beaten down due to the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill had run their course.
 The euro rose 2.1 percent against the U.S. dollar this
week, its best weekly performance since May 2009, as anxiety
about the fiscal health of euro zone countries eased this week
and Spain attracted buyers for an auction of its debt.
 Speculators cut short euro positions sharply in the week to
June 15, a period in which the euro rose 3 percent against the
dollar.
 After hitting a three-week high above $1.24 on Thursday,
the euro retreated to $1.2373 , unchanged on the day.
 The euro slid to a record low  at 1.3718 Swiss
francs, according to Reuters data, while the dollar hit a
one-month low of 1.1081 francs .
 The dollar index <.DXY> was flat at 85.737, after falling
to a one-month low at 85.453.
 U.S. Treasury prices drifted lower in light trading as the
market cleaved tightly to a yield range established over the
past week and a half with no economic data to influence

 The limited strength in equities tugged on Treasuries, as
they continued the highly correlated inverse relationship to
stocks prices seen in recent days.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  traded
9/23 lower in price to yield 3.23 percent.
 U.S. crude oil prices finished higher after wavering with
U.S. equities, while oil traders' concerns about the danger of
slowing Chinese demand and longer-term deepwater supply risks
weighed on Brent crude and products. [ID:nSGE65H07V]
 U.S. crude futures for July  rose 39 cents to settle
at $77.18 a barrel.
 Front-month August ICE Brent futures  fell 46 cents
to settle at $78.22 a barrel, having traded as low as $77.25
earlier.
 U.S. gold futures settled at the highest close ever after
racing to a record level as investors continued to buy precious
metals as an alternative asset after weak U.S. data on Thursday
renewed worries about the pace of recovery, traders said.
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  in New York
climbed to record $1,263.70 an ounce, and settled up $9.60 at
$1,258.30, its highest close.
 ""It is a case of gold's ability to compete with both credit
and equity markets for investments. Competing with credit
markets has been in play for a long time, because of low
interest rates and low opportunity cost of holding gold,"" said

 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 18 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar ended
firmer on Friday, ending a two-day slide and breaking above a
key techncial level, as oil prices climbed and moderate gains
on equity markets provided support.
 The price of oil, often a driver of Canada's
commodity-linked currency, pushed above $77 a barrel to erase
early losses. Support was also drawn from stock markets, which
were higher for most of the day. [.TO] [.N] [O/R]
 ""The price of oil is doing OK and that's Canada positive.
Equities are marginally higher but there's just a general sort
of treading water in markets,"" said Brendan McGrath at currency
services firm Custom House.
 ""I think what's important to note with dollar/Canada right
now is that it's broken below C$1.0250.""
 The currency had been testing that key technical level much
of the week and was not able to break through significantly
until Friday, when it reached C$1.0207 to the U.S. dollar.
 If the currency holds stronger than C$1.0250, then this
could auger well for further advances against the greenback
unless there are dire developments in Europe, McGrath said.
 The Canadian dollar closed at C$1.0212 to the U.S. dollar,
or 97.92 U.S. cents. That is up from Thursday's close of
C$1.0270 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.37 U.S. cents. For the week,
it was up 1.2 percent.
 A rise in the composite leading indicator for May, a broad
measure of the Canadian economy, also helped support the
Canadian dollar. Its 0.9 percent rise from April, the 12th
straight monthly gain, was greater than the 0.7 percent advance
expected by market operators. [ID:nN18228501] [ID:nN18136363]
 The figures helped balance lower than expected data earlier
this week on home resales for May and wholesale trade in April.
[ID:nN16194833] [ID:N17212998]
 BONDS FALL
 Canadian government bond prices posted slim losses with few
catalysts to spark a meaningful move.
 Investors largely shrugged off a speech by Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney, who cautioned investors again on Friday
not to take another interest rate hike for granted, saying
volatile global conditions mean no particular path for monetary
policy is preordained. [ID:nN18116394]
 The two-year government bond  dipped 4 Canadian
cents to yield 1.742 percent, while the 10-year bond
 fell 21 Canadian cents to yield 3.328 percent.
 Canadian bonds mostly outperformed against U.S. Treasuries,
except in the 30-year maturity. The Canadian 10-year bond yield
was 10.2 basis points above its U.S. counterpart, compared with
11.1 basis points on Thursday.

 NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near a
three-week high against the dollar on Friday, chalking up its
biggest weekly gain in over a year as European leaders said
they would publish details about the health of European banks.
 With markets a bit less anxious about Spain's public
finances after the country attracted buyers for a debt auction
this week, some analysts said the stress test results could
boost trust in Europe's banking system.
 But others cautioned that signs of trouble in the sector
could put the brakes on euro gains, snapping a rally that
lifted the currency 2.1 percent against the dollar this week,
its best weekly performance since May 2009.
 Bank stress tests ""could be quite significant if they in
fact show that significant capital needs to be raised by some
of the major European banks,"" said Brian Dolan, chief
strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""The euro
zone is by no means out of the woods.""
 After hitting a three-week high above $1.24 Thursday, the
euro retreated to $1.2373 , unchanged on the day. It was
still rooted in a short-term uptrend that began after hitting
$1.1876 last week, its worst level since 2006. the currency was
0.3 percent weaker at 112.26 yen  while the dollar was
off 0.3 percent at 90.71 yen .
 Anxiety about the fiscal health of euro zone countries has
eased a bit over the last week and encouraged investors to
unwind bets against the single currency.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data on Friday showed
speculators cut short euro positions sharply in the week to
June 15, a period in which the euro rose 3 percent against the
dollar. [ID:nN18171360]
 ""We're going to see whether the euro is going to sustain
these gains and press on toward $1.25,"" Dolan said, adding a
move back below $1.2340 or so could spark some profit-taking.
 BNP Paribas strategists see the euro's corrective rebound
running out of steam near $1.2525, saying data suggest euro
gains are ""not backed by real money investment flows.""
 SWISS, CHINESE CURRENCIES GAIN
 The euro slid to a record low  at 1.3718 Swiss
francs, according to Reuters data, while the dollar hit a
one-month low of 1.1081 francs .
 The franc gained after Switzerland's central bank on
Thursday backed away from a pledge to fight currency strength
and said deflation risks have receded. [ID:nLDE65E1W2]
 The dollar index <.DXY> was flat at 85.737, after falling
to a one-month low at 85.453. Technical analysts said it looked
vulnerable after breaking through support at 85.85, with the
next key level seen in the 85.13 area, its May 21 low.

 Benchmark one-year non-deliverable forwards 
fell as far 6.6780. That implied investors were betting on a

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2010 12:30PM ET</span>",Russia's modernisation: pipe dream or reality?," * Investors sceptical of Kremlin rebranding drive
 * Say Russia's corruption, red tape must be fixed
 * Young Russian businessmen call for swift action, not talk
 
 By Guy Faulconbridge and Dmitry Sergeyev
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 18 (Reuters) - If President
Dmitry Medvedev's vision of modernising Russia is ever going to
become reality, the Kremlin must stamp out corruption and stop
greedy officials from crippling businesses, investors said.
 Reacting to Medvedev's speech to the country's annual
business forum promising a bright high-tech future for Russia,
company bosses praised the president's high-flown rhetoric but
expressed worry about the country's daily reality.
 ""I am going to tell the president: find success and shine
lights on it,"" said Joe Schoendorf, a venture capitalist at
Accel Partners, which has over $6 billion under management.
 ""Make sure that the Russian system does not slow it down,
make sure that Russian corruption doesn't get involved with it
and if it does, kill it,"" said Schoendorf, who was to attend an
meeting with Medvedev during the St Petersburg Economic Forum.
 The 44-year-old Kremlin chief wants Russia to diversify away
from oil, gas and metals after the global crisis shattered a
decade-long boom, leading to a severe recession last year.
 But more than half way through his four-year presidential
term, Medvedev's opponents say he has failed to significantly
reform the political and economic system he inherited from his
mentor Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister and paramount
leader.
 ""I am not going to argue with you: corruption is a big
problem for the Russian economy,"" Medvedev said, after he was
quizzed by business leaders over the graft which has seeped into
every walk of Russian life.
 ""We are certainly aware of the scale of the disaster and we
believe that without cutting out corruption at all levels we
will not have any kind of investment future,"" he said.
 Critics say Medvedev cannot effectively tackle corruption
because this would mean challenging the entrenched business
interests and wealth of top government officials.
 
 INNOVATION CITY?
 Medvedev's ambitious plans to spur technological innovation
in a country that has depended on selling natural resources for
centuries took centre stage at the St Petersburg conference,
Russia's answer to the Davos World Economic Forum.
 At one breakfast session, officials asked CEOs and bankers
to form groups to brainstorm on what Russia needed to do.
 Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef Ackermann, summed up a
discussion at one table, saying Russia needed ""to have an
institutional framework that allows people actually to develop
their own initiatives and their own businesses.""
 ""Two words have to be mentioned in this context,
bureaucracy, on several levels... and of course corruption,""
said Ackermann.
 But the strongest scepticism came not from foreigners but
from a new generation of Russian businessmen.
 During a discussion on innovation, Cisco Systems Chief
Executive John Chambers and Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg
were quizzed by a 22-year-old Russian businessman who said he
was going to try his luck in Silicon Valley.
 Alexander Debelov, who set up Massachusetts-based
Crelligence Media, a company that sells video marketing
products, said the business culture and large pools of capital
in north America made it way more attractive than Russia.
 ""I don't think it is realistic to expect there to be an
innovative economy created in Russia,"" said Arman Saakyan, a
24-year-old Russian founder of Alliance Investment Group.
 ""We can talk until the cows come home about innovation and
modernisation, but without concrete action it is just a string
of empty promises.""

 NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - The euro held near a
three-week high against the dollar on Friday, heading for its
biggest weekly gain in more than a year as investors debated
the single currency's outlook while awaiting results of
European bank stress tests.
 The euro steadied just below $1.24 after a solid Spanish
government bond auction on Thursday eased concerns about the
country's public finances and investors unwound large short
positions accumulated during the currency's sell-off in recent
months.
 The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen after
disappointing U.S. economic data this week prompted investors
to scale back expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest
rate rise.
 ""We had some nice euro gains and dollar weakness over the
course of this week. We're going to see whether the euro is
going to sustain these gains and press on toward $1.25,"" said
Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New
Jersey.
 ""But if we see a move back below $1.2340/50, it looks like
we might see some end-of-week profit-taking and selling of
euros,"" he added.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was at $1.2366, down
0.1 percent on the day, after rising to a three-week high of
$1.2417 on electronic trading platform EBS.
 The euro has rebounded about 2 percent against the dollar
this week, the biggest weekly rise since May 2009, pulling the
currency further away from its four-year low of $1.1876 struck
on EBS on June 7.
 Against the yen, the dollar dipped to a three-week low at
90.45 yen and was last at 90.78 yen, down 0.2 percent.
 The Swiss franc gained after Switzerland's central bank on
Thursday backed away from its pledge to fight excessive
currency strength and said that for now, deflation risks have
receded.
 The euro slid to a record low at 1.3718 Swiss francs,
according to Reuters data, while the dollar hit a one-month low
of 1.1081 francs.
 REBOUND FACES STRESS TEST RESULTS
 ""The euro remains upside corrective and on track to test
the $1.2445 2009 low and inter-year pivot,"" technical analysts
at Commerzbank said.
 A continuation of this rally, however, seems subject to the
results of the stress tests for European banks.
 European leaders agreed on Thursday to publish details of
stress tests showing the financial health of big banks next
month. Some in the market said the release of stress tests
would boost trust in European banks but others were concerned
they could reveal fragility in the sector and hurt the euro.
 ""They could be quite significant if they in fact show that
significant capital needs to be raised by some of the major
European banks,"" Forex.com's Dolan said. ""The euro zone is by
no means out of the woods.""
 Analysts at BNP Paribas see the euro's corrective rebound
running out of steam at around $1.2525, saying flows data
suggest the current rebound is ""not backed by real money
investment flows.""
 The dollar index was flat at 85.737, after falling to a
one-month low at 85.453. Technical analysts said it looked
vulnerable after breaking through support at 85.85, with the
next key level seen in the 85.13 area, its May 21 low.
 The Chinese yuan rose to a one-month high against the U.S.
dollar in offshore forwards as investors bet China may
eventually cave in to growing pressure from U.S. Congress to
let the yuan rise in value.
 Benchmark one-year non-deliverable forwards fell as far
6.6780. That implied investors were betting on a 2.2 percent
rise in the yuan against the U.S. dollar over the next year, up
from bets of a 1.3 percent gain on Thursday.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for
a ninth straight day on Friday as investors increased their
risk appetite after a Spanish bond auction eased their worst
fears about euro zone sovereign debt, helping the euro hold at
three-week highs.
 MSCI's all-country world index <.MIWD00000PUS> gained about
0.5 percent, allowing U.S. and European shares to retrace all
their losses for this year. The index has rebounded around 7
percent since its June 7 close and gained more than 3 percent
this week.
 Its emerging markets counterpart <.MSCIEF> outperformed and
was up almost 0.7 percent.
 The euro steadied around $1.24 as it headed toward its
biggest weekly gain in more than a year as investors unwound
large short positions accumulated during the currency's
sell-off in recent months. [ID:nN18130066]

going to sustain these gains and press on toward $1.25,"" said
Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New
Jersey.
 The euro  was up 0.04 percent at $1.2383.
 The U.S. Dollar Index <.DXY> was down 0.08 percent at
85.621, and against the yen, the dollar  was down 0.22
percent at 90.78.
 U.S. stocks rose in early trading and were set for
back-to-back weekly gains, as investors juggled with the
expiration of stock options.
 Basic materials companies took the lead in a market that
traded in a very tight range. Eastman Chemical  gained
2.2 percent and the S&P materials index <.GSPM> edged up 0.6
percent.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> edged up 40.66
points, or 0.39 percent, to 10,474.60. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> added 4.35 points, or 0.39 percent, to
1,120.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> rose 13.80 points,
or 0.60 percent, to 2,320.88.
 Investors have gradually been moving back into riskier
assets this month after a sharp correction in May made
valuations more attractive and key volatility gauges, such as
Wall St's Vix index, almost halved from mid-May peaks.
 Spain's Treasury sold 3.5 billion euros of debt on
Thursday, and a government official said the sale gave it
enough liquidity to deal with a 24 billion euro ($29.4 billion)
repayments crunch in July.
 In addition, EU leaders and officials on Friday firmed up
plans to publish bank ""stress tests"" next month as they looked
to minimize adverse speculation that has been dogging the
sector all year.
 But investors in commodities overlooked increased risk
appetite in the wider markets as oil and copper prices faltered
on signs economic growth in the United States and China may not
be as rapid as expected. [ID:nSGE65H07V]
 A Chinese official said growth was expected to slow in the
second half of this year and that double-digit growth for the
full year seemed unlikely. [ID:nTST000214]
 The warning, which prompted a sell-off in Chinese equities,
followed U.S. data on Thursday showing jobless claims increased
unexpectedly last week as the manufacturing, construction and
education sectors shed workers. [ID:nN17254724]
 ""The recovery is going to be quite slow in a number of
countries,"" said Daniel Smith, an analyst at Standard
Chartered.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  was up 18 cents to $76.97
per barrel after earlier trading lower.
 Gold rallied to a record high near $1,260 an ounce as
momentum triggered by buying of the metal as a haven from
sovereign and financial risk pushed prices through technical
resistance to near their previous peak. [ID:nLDE65H0HL]
 U.S. Treasury prices drifted lower in light trading as the
market cleaved tightly to a yield range established over the
past week and a half, with little on the agenda to influence
prices. [ID:nN18122591]
 ""It is a classic summer Friday with no economic data and
much of the market dreaming about an early close to make it a
long weekend,"" said Ian Lyngen, senior government bond
strategist at CRT Capital Group in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 8/32 in price to yield 3.2213 percent.

 * Moves driven by speculators unwinding short positions
 * As euro finds floor, stocks start relief rally
 
 By Simon Falush and Blaise Robinson
 LONDON/PARIS, June 18 (Reuters) - The euro's fortunes have
closely mirrored those of equities this year, with both tracking
investors' appetite for risk, but now the euro seems to have
found a floor, this correlation looks set to fade.
 Euro/dollar's correlation with the FTSEurofirst 300 peaked
at 0.98 on a monthly basis at the start of May, but had slipped
to 0.45 by Friday.
 This correlation could retreat further as the euro finds
more stability around its current levels, as a weaker euro is
supportive of European exports, which would see equities gaining
ground while the euro holds steady.
 ""Stocks couldn't rise as long as the euro was falling, but
now that the currency has found a floor, people start to price
in the extremely positive effect of a lower euro on corporate
profits,"" said Francois Chevallier, strategist at Banque
Leonardo, in Paris.
 Investors looking to judge the next move for equities will
not see such clear signals from currency moves as has been the
case this month.
 The euro replaced equities as the weather vane for moves in
financial markets as record short positions built up on the
currency's rapid descent have made it more sensitive to
improvements in risk appetite.
 The euro's slump -- it fell from over $1.50 in December to a
trough below $1.19 earlier this month -- was fuelled in large
part by massive bets against it by speculators.
 The Eurofirst 300 has gained 2.8 percent this week while the
euro has gained 2.2 percent against the dollar.
 ""The moves in the euro have been dictating the direction
European stocks over the past little while. That has clearly
been the main driver for equities,"" said Vincent Ganne,
technical analyst at IG Markets, in Paris.
 Speculators boosted bets against the euro to a fresh record
of 113,890 contracts in May according to Reuters data, and signs
of positive resolution of the euro zone's debt crisis have seen
investors quick to pare back their most extreme positions.
 ""There's been a lessening of pessimism and that did seem to
take hold first in the FX market,"" said Phil Roberts, chief
European Technical strategist at Barclays Capital in London.
 ""I think it is a case of reducing outstanding positions in a
lot of cases rather than aggressively putting risk on.""
 
 RISK SIGNALS
 This has seen the euro move higher before stock markets on
positive risk signals, for example, when euro zone debt auctions
were fully subscribed on Tuesday.
 ""We are splitting down the euro zone fixed income markets
(and stock markets to a lesser extent) as we price things
separately,"" said Nicole Elliott, technical analyst at Mizuho.
""This in turn exposes stress in the EU system and affects the
value of the euro.""
 The fact that gains in the euro and from equities are to a
large extent derived from the unwinding of extreme short
positions means investors should be cautious about the
durability of the recent rally, Roberts said.
 ""I would try not to get too excited, because I think it
could burn quite brightly in the short term, but the risk is
that we are still in a relatively neutral, negative
environment.""
 He said it was not an aggressive reappraisal of the risks to
the global economy but investors and speculators taking profits
after sharp moves and pointed to stability in dollar/yen -- a
classic risk play -- as evidence that there is a lack of new
positioning coming in.

(Adds quotes, analyst, Canada prime minister, White House)
 By Jeff Mason and Simon Rabinovitch
 WASHINGTON/BEIJING, June 18 (Reuters) - The United States
pressed China on Friday to move toward a market-based exchange
rate, but Beijing said not to meddle with its management of the
yuan, setting the stage for a clash at next week's G20 summit.
 World leaders gathering in Toronto on June 26-27 are
struggling to maintain the crisis-forged unity that has been
credited with preventing another Great Depression.
 Now that the global economy is on the mend, divisions are
beginning to show.
 U.S. President Barack Obama released a letter to his Group
of 20 colleagues that zeroed in on prickly policy differences
over China's currency stance and debt-wary Europe's rush to
rein in bulging budget deficits.
 Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who will host the
meeting, urged G20 countries to halve their fiscal deficits by
2013 and stabilize debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016, according to an
official, who also said China's currency would be discussed.
 But China largely took the issue off the table, saying its
currency, also known as the renminbi, was its own business.
 ""The RMB is China's currency, so I don't think it is an
issue that should be discussed internationally,"" Cui Tiankai, a
vice foreign minister who is China's G20 sherpa, the official
in charge of preparing for the summit, told a news briefing.
 Obama, under pressure from some U.S. lawmakers who accuse
his administration of soft-pedaling on China, said
free-floating currencies were ""essential"" to global economic
activity, a thinly veiled reference to the yuan.
 ""The signals that flexible exchange rates send are
necessary to support a strong and balanced global economy,""
Obama wrote.
 China has kept the yuan steady at around 6.83 per dollar
for almost two years to help its exporters ride out the global
financial crisis. Many Western economists believe it is
undervalued by as much as 40 percent.
 ""China's statement is ... absolutely outrageous,"" said
Morris Goldstein, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics in Washington ""Where should we be
discussing it. At the World Cup?""
 Obama's administration has stopped short of accusing China
of manipulating its currency to give it a trade advantage,
something that some members of the U.S. Congress have urged.
 The Treasury Department delayed its regular currency report
to Congress, which was due in April, angering some legislators
who think the administration is dragging its feet.
 The White House said the world would be ""better off"" if
China had a market-based exchange rate. A spokeswoman said the
administration would ""take stock"" on the issue of the currency
report after the G20 meeting.
 The yuan rose to a one-month high against the dollar in
offshore forwards on Friday as investors bet that China might
eventually cave in to growing pressure to let the yuan rise in
value.
 DON'T PULL THE PLUG NOW
 Obama also directed stern words at Europe. In a letter to
G20 colleagues dated June 16, he said the highest priority at
next week's meeting must be to safeguard the recovery and not
succumb too soon to demands to shrink government debt.
 ""We worked exceptionally hard to restore growth; we cannot
let it falter or lose strength now,"" he said.
 The United States has urged Germany in particular not to
pull the plug on government spending too soon for fear that
doing so will derail the still-fragile economic recovery.
 Berlin thinks shoring up public finances is an immediate
priority, underscored by Greece's debt troubles and growing
worries that other small, heavily indebted European countries
could face a similar fate.
 Obama said it was critical that the timing and pace of the
fiscal pullback ""suit the needs of the global economy"" and not
just domestic demands.
 The United States and China appeared to find some common
ground on this issue. Zhu Guangyao, China's vice finance
minister, said countries with serious budget deficits should
accelerate fiscal consolidation but in a manner that is
""growth-friendly.""
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has used the same
phrase to describe the U.S. position on debt.
 Obama said countries should be prepared to respond quickly
and forcefully to avert another slowdown if the recovery fades.
That might not be well received at home, where Obama has faced
resistance from Congress over adding to an already swollen
government debt burden.
 Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged the
United States to concentrate on boosting its public finances,
too.
 ""An urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining
some traction among American lawmakers. If so, it is none too
soon. Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are
misleading,"" he wrote in The Wall Street Journal.
 ""Our economy cannot afford a major mistake in
underestimating the corrosive momentum of this fiscal crisis.
Our policy focus must therefore err significantly on the side
of restraint.""

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2010 09:34AM ET</span>",GLOBAL MARKETS WEEKAHEAD-Tensions easing ahead of second half," By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - Tensions in global financial
markets stemming from the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis
appear to be easing, setting the stage for investors to dip back
into risky assets in the second half of this year.
 This week's relatively successful bond sales in peripheral
euro zone countries and expectations that the Federal Reserve
and other central banks would keep borrowing costs low are
calming investor nerves after a risk storm in May prompted a
rush to safe-haven assets.
 Against this backdrop, world stocks, measured by MSCI, are
now on track for scoring its biggest weekly gains since early
March after hitting a one-month high on Friday. European shares
are rallying for eight days in a row, while Asian stocks ended
their best week in six months.
 The euro rose to a three-week peak above $1.24, making a
speedy rebound after plunging to a four-year low below $1.19
less than a fortnight ago.
 In a sign of normalisation, the Wall Street's fear gauge --
the Volatility Index -- tumbled to 25 from setting a 14-month
high above 47 in May.
 Fund tracker EPFR reported that over $37 billion flowed out
of money market funds in the latest week while global equity
funds saw the biggest inflow since early April.
 Next week brings a series of event risks from the Group of
20 summit in Canada, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy
meeting and Britain's emergency budget. 
 While a replay of the May sell-off looks unlikely, the pace
of investors getting back into risky assets may be moderate.
 ""As we do not believe in a double-dip recession, we remain
positive,"" said Frederic Buzare, global head of traditional
equity management at Dexia Asset Management.
 ""We may conclude that there is significant upside potential
for the equity markets but that is not a free lunch. Difficult
summer months are probably in prospect before a rally starts in
the fourth quarter.""
 Next week also brings a fresh reading of international
business sentiment with flash surveys from the euro zone's
manufacturing and services sectors.
 Credit Suisse says global purchasing managers indexes
suggest the global economy would grow about 4.5-5 percent in the
second half of 2010, adding fears of a double dip recession --
which occurred only twice in the past 100 years -- are overdone.
 Corporates are also healthy. According to the Swiss bank,
corporate free cash flows stand at an all-time high of 3.6
percent of gross domestic product and cash on balance sheet is
at a 50-year high of 5.8 percent of total assets.
 The second quarter earnings season which kicks off next
month could also provide a positive backdrop. Thomson Reuters
data shows an earnings growth rate for S&P 500 firms is
estimated at 27.5 percent in the second quarter, after expanding
57.4 percent in the first quarter.
 ""Despite the noises that characterised the market, it should
not be forgotten that the world has returned to growth and
emerging economies still have a bright prospect,"" said William
de Vijlder, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Investment
Partners.
He recommends cautious asset allocation, maintaining limited
exposure to risky assets while overweighting commodities and
emerging markets.
 
 RISK SPOTS
 Heading into next week, Spain might provide a source of
anxiety even after it drew strong investor appetite when it sold
3.5 billion euros of bonds on Thursday.
 Spain's parliament is expected to vote on government's
labour market reforms next week.
 ""The country is far from insolvency, but debt roll-over risk
remains an issue,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.
 ""(But) if the Spanish authorities reinforce their commitment
to address the budgetary consolidation, engage structural
reforms, and recapitalise the banking system, there is no reason
to think that spreads won't stabilise and reverse.""
 Next week's G20 summit in Toronto on June 26 and 27 would
provide more clarity on financial reform. 
 There has been some disagreement among member countries on
the best approach to financial reform in some areas, such as a
proposed bank tax, and a U.S. plan to ban risky proprietary
trading at some banks, which the European Union has rejected.
 At a preparatory meeting in South Korea earlier in June, G20
finance ministers came short of agreeing on any global bank levy
because of opposition from Canada, Brazil and Japan.
 But they did agree that the financial sector should make a
fair and substantial contribution towards paying for any burdens
associated with government interventions, where they occur, to

 By Jennifer Kwan
 TORONTO, June 18 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar slipped on
Friday, nudged lower by soft oil prices that were hit by signs
that economic growth in the world's top oil consumers may not
be as robust as foreseen.
 Oil dropped more than $1 to below $76 a barrel, dragged
down in part by a warning from a Chinese central bank adviser
that economic growth was expected to slow in the second half of
this year, as well as weak U.S. economic data released the day
before. [ID:nTST000214]
 ""We're seeing some downward pressure on oil prices so we're
below yesterday's close and we're seeing that the U.S. dollar
is generally mixed,"" said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist
at Scotia Capital. [FRX/]
 At 7:43 a.m. (1143 GMT), the Canadian dollar was at
C$1.0290 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.18 U.S. cents, down from
Thursday's finish at C$1.0270 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.37 U.S.
cents.
 Investors shrugged off a speech in St John's, Newfoundland,
by Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, who cautioned investors
again on Friday not to take another interest rate hike for
granted, saying volatile global conditions mean no particular
path for monetary policy is preordained. [ID:nN18116394]
 The speech was nearly identical to one given on June 16.

 The currency's flat to softer performance on Friday
followed disappointing jobless claims and factory activity
data, which was released the day before. [ID:nN17207354]

 Canadian government bond prices were largely flat to lower,
influenced by softer U.S. Treasuries on easing euro zone debt
concerns. [US/]
 The two-year government bond  slipped 2 Canadian
cents to yield 1.733 percent, while the 10-year bond
 ticked 5 Canadian cents higher to yield 3.298

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2010 07:30AM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Obama prods China on currency rates in G20 letter," * Obama says market-determined exchange rates ""essential""
 * Says public finances should be addressed in medium term
(Recasts, adds quotes from letter)
 By Jeff Mason
 WASHINGTON, June 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama
raised the prospect of a clash with China at a summit next week
by calling for market-determined exchange rates, shortly after
Beijing told the world not to criticize its currency policy.
 Obama, in a letter dated June 16, urged G20 partners to
redouble efforts on financial reform. In a reference to
austerity measures in Europe, the U.S. president also said
public finance problems should be addressed ""in the medium
term"" -- a warning that clamping down on budgets should not be
done at the expense of economic recovery.
 Obama's letter, released on Friday, zeros in on prickly
policy differences between the United States and two of its
largest trading partners.
 Washington has been pushing for Beijing to allow its yuan
currency to rise more quickly and develop domestic demand
rather than relying on exports for growth.
 It has also diverged from Europe's biggest economy,
Germany, by preaching patience in clamping down on public
spending even as Berlin and other European capitals struggle to
address public debt that has thrown the eurozone into crisis.
 ""The signals that flexible exchange rates send are
necessary to support a strong and balanced global economy,""
Obama wrote in the letter, referencing China without naming the
country outright.
 ""Market-determined exchange rates are essential to global
economic vitality.""
 The Obama administration has stopped short of accusing
China of manipulating its currency to give it a trade
advantage, something that some members of the U.S. Congress
have urged.
 The Treasury Department delayed its regular currency report
to Congress, which was due in April, angering some lawmakers
who think the administration is dragging its feet.
 CHINA WARNS AGAINST MEDDLING
 China told the rest of the world on Friday not to meddle
with the way it manages the yuan, calling the exchange rate a
sovereign matter for it alone to decide and all but ruling it
out of bounds at next week's G20 summit.
 In the letter, Obama urged G20 leaders to accelerate
financial reform and stand ready to respond quickly if
necessary to avert an economic slowdown.
 ""We must act together to strengthen the recovery,"" Obama
said. ""We need to commit to restore sustainable public finances
in the medium term. And we should complete the work of
financial repair and reform.""
 He said the United States wanted G20 negotiators to agree
to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements for
financial institutions, stronger oversight of derivatives
markets, and a framework for winding down large global firms
and getting the financial sector to pay for the burdens it
creates.
 Obama said the group's highest priority during its June
26-27 meeting should be to safeguard and strengthen global
economic recovery.
 He said G20 leaders must reaffirm their support to ""provide
the policy support necessary"" to keep economic growth strong.
 ""Should confidence in the strength of our recoveries
diminish, we should be prepared to respond again as quickly and
as forcefully as needed to avert a slowdown in economic
activity,"" he said.

 By Tamawa Desai
 LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - The euro was pinned near
three-week highs on Friday, on track for its second successive
week of gains, while the dollar appeared vulnerable to further
losses after falling below a key chart level.
 The dollar slipped after a slew of disappointing U.S.
economic data, which helped push U.S. Treasury yields to their
lowest in a week.
 The euro held gains near $1.24 as investors shed short
positions after solid demand for Spanish government bond
auctions on Thursday eased concerns about Spain's debt-servicing
abilities, boosting sentiment for riskier assets.
 ""Financial system concerns have eased, and some players are
re-establishing carry trades, seeking higher-yielding assets,""
said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ.
 The Swiss franc was also firm after Switzerland's central
bank on Thursday backed away from its pledge to fight excessive
currency strength now that deflation risks have receded.
 The euro slid to a record low against the franc at 1.3730
franc while the dollar hovered near a one-month low of 1.1095
franc.
 The euro's rebound against the dollar has seen it gain more
than 2 percent so far this week, pulling further away from a
four-year low of $1.1875 struck on June 7. 
 On Friday, it rose as far as $1.2417 on trading platform
EBS. By 1026 GMT, it was flat on the day at $1.2374.
 ""The euro remains upside corrective and on track to test the
$1.2445 2009 low and inter-year pivot,"" technical analysts at
Commerzbank said. 
 ""This, together with the 38.2 percent retracement of the
move down from April represents our initial corrective target.""
 Traders said options with a strike price at $1.2400 were set
to expire later in the day. Option barriers were lurking around
$1.2450, capping the upside, they added.
 But many analysts see the euro's rebound waning.
 Flows data suggest the current rebound is ""not backed by
real money investment flows (private or official), implying
gains are likely to be short-lived,"" BNP analysts said. They see
the corrective rebound running out of steam at around $1.2525.
 
 SHAKY DOLLAR
 European leaders agreed on Thursday to publish details of
stress tests showing the financial health of big banks next
month and to toughen budget rules to restore confidence in the
euro zone.
 Some in the market said the release of stress tests would
boost investor trust in European banks but others were concerned
they could reveal fragility in the sector and hurt the euro.
 The dollar took a hit after a rise in jobless claims,
weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and a big drop in
consumer prices on Thursday prompted investors to scale back
expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike.
 The dollar index was flat at 85.694, after falling to a
one-month low at 85.491. Technically, it looked vulnerable after
it broke through support at 85.85, with the next key level seen
in the 85.13 area, its May 21 low.
 Sterling hit a one-month high against the dollar.
 The dollar dipped to a three-week low against the yen at
90.47 yen. It was last at 90.53 yen, down 0.4 percent on the

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2010 06:42AM ET</span>",CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Germany urges peer pressure on stress tests," * German banks can't be obliged to disclose tests
 * Government to find way round banking law
 * Banks won't be forced but will feel market pressure
 
 (Corrects title of ministry spokesman in paragraph two)
 By Stephen Brown and Matthias Sobolewski
 BERLIN, June 18 (Reuters) - The German government will check
how banking laws can be interpreted or changed so that stress
tests can be made public, but will rely on peer pressure rather
than forcing reluctant lenders to disclose, it said on Friday.
 The German government will not oblige banks to reveal test
results but they will feel ""high pressure to disclose because
the markets see who has published and who hasn't"", said German
Finance Ministry spokesman Michael Offer.
 German law currently prevents lenders from being obliged to
disclose such information but the country is now, along with its
European Union partners, in favour of making such data public to
help restore shaken confidence in the banking industry.
 Leaders of the 27-member EU agreed unexpectedly on Thursday
to carry out more transparent checks of the financial health of
their top banks as part of measures to convince investors that
Europe can contain the euro zone debt crisis.
 The finance ministry spokesman, asked by Reuters at a news
conference about paragraph nine of the German law on banks which
refers to data protection and disclosure, responded: ""I can only
say that we must check it further.""
 ""I believe that paragraph nine applies to individual finance
institutions and also we have to see in what form this paragraph
nine would permit publication, or rather what needs changing in
order to meet the goals that were discussed yesterday,"" he said.
 Asked if the government would rely on voluntary disclosure
by banks or wanted the law changed, he said: ""The idea of making
this voluntary played a role, I believe, yesterday evening (at
the EU summit), if I've understood the statement correctly.""
 Financial regulator Bafin and probably the central bank
would have to be consulted, Offer said, adding: ""We will do what
we think is necessary to restore the confidence of the markets.""
 
 DAMNED IF YOU DON'T
 ""Strong banks won't hesitate to make their results public,
which means no bank can afford not to disclose its results
without running the risk of being seen as weak,"" wrote Merck
Finck's banking analyst Konrad Becker in a report.
 EU leaders said at the summit that stress tests on the top
25 banks in the bloc would be published in late July. Germany
was initially reluctant to disclose the results for individual
lenders but came out in support of this ahead of the summit.
 Germany's VOB association of public-sector banks has spoken
out against publicising the results of individual banks' tests,
but banking industry analysts said it would look suspicious if
German banks did not comply while other EU banks went ahead.
 ""It would quickly arouse suspicions that the Germans have
something to hide,"" said Equinet analyst Philipp Haessler, who
added: ""I see no problem for the big listed banks.""
 The same might not be true of some of Germany's state-backed
regional Landesbank lenders, whose top three players LBBW,
Munich's BayernLB and Duesseldorf-based WestLB were caught out
in the financial crisis.
 They suffered big losses which forced them to seek bailouts
from their public-sector owners.

 * High-yield company Remy Cointreau unveils buy-back
 
 LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - European corporate credit
default swap spreads held steady on Friday, but still lagged a
rally in European equities that reflected a more positive mood
generally among these investors.
 By 1003 GMT, the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index
was at 120 basis points, according to data from Markit. That is
unchanged from late on Thursday, according to data from BGC
Partners.
 The Markit iTraxx Crossover index, made up of 50 mostly
""junk""-rated credits, was at 539 basis points, 1
basis point tighter.
 Sovereign CDS spreads were also edging tighter, with the
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe index about 5.5 basis points
tighter at 136.5 basis points, according to Markit.
 Credit markets have tended to lag an advance in European
equities this week because of their fixation with the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe.
 ""The inconsistency between credit and equity markets can
only be explained by the discrepancy in confidence levels being
expressed by the markets,"" BNP Paribas credit strategists said
in a note to investors.
 The credit markets are focusing on the European Union's
plans to publish in July details of ""stress tests"" showing the
financial health of major banks.
 ""Greater transparency on the big names will be provided but
we won't be any the wiser on smaller names such as the savings
banks and the Landesbanks in Germany,"" credit analysts at Royal
Bank of Scotland said in a note.
 ""Level of detail to be disclosed still needs to be decided
on and what exactly the tests were testing is not really clear
yet other than to assess the impact on banks in the ""most
adverse scenarios,"" they said.
 Five-year CDS on oil company BP were at about 450 basis
points, around 18 basis points wider than Markit's official
close on Thursday of 432 basis points.
 The company's CDS had widened out to about 460 basis points
in late trading on Thursday after Markit's official close. This
followed reports that BP is seeking to raise debt financing as
it continues to fight the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
 BP's CDS have had a volatile week, closing on Monday at
about 424 basis points and then widening further to 614 basis
points at the close on Wednesday, according to Markit.
 The first evidence of a reopening of the European high-yield
bond market emerged in the primary market, with French spirits
maker Remy Cointreau announcing plans to issue about 200 million
euros ($247.6 million) of bonds as part of a bond buyback.
 More high-yield companies are expected to follow in its
wake.

 * EU's Hedegaard: don't take green-tech jobs for granted
 * No border taxes for now, sectoral deals preferred
 * Global technology cooperation better than tech transfer
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - Europe's green-technology
industries need determined political backing if they are to
outpace rivals in Asia, Europe's climate chief said on
Wednesday.
 European Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard observed the
fine balance Europe must strike with China and other swiftly
developing regions, sometimes as trade rivals and other times as
partners in tackling climate change.
 ""Europe must do whatever we can to protect and develop our
stronghold within the energy-efficient and renewables sectors,""
she told Reuters in an interview. 
 ""There's a growing recognition that our strong position is
not automatic in the next decade,"" she added. ""We must fight for
it.""
 Hedegaard spoke amid a tense European debate over whether to
deepen planned cuts to carbon dioxide emissions over the next
decade to 30 percent below 1990 levels, compared to current
plans for a 20 percent cut.
 Europe's powerful business lobby has successfully fought off
the prospect of deeper cuts, saying they would make traditional
heavy industries such as steel and cement lose market share to
less-regulated overseas rivals -- so-called ""carbon leakage"".
 But many of Europe's greener governments are starting to
worry that staying at 20 percent would undermine the EU carbon
market, which makes industry pay for permits to pollute and
provides the main incentive for green innovation.
 France, Britain and Spain are among them.
 ""Yes, there can be carbon leakage if you are too ambitious,
but you can also lose jobs if you are standing still while your
competitors are moving ... if you are not innovating enough,""
Hedegaard said. ""We must find the right balance point.""
 
 BORDER TARIFFS
 She declined to speculate on whether Europe would deepen
emissions cuts on its own if international climate talks fail
again to reach a deal in Cancun, Mexico in December. 
 But she raised the difficult question of Europe's growth
prospects if it does not increase the pressure for innovation in
the face of strong competition from China, Japan, Brazil and
South Korea.
 ""What are we going to live from in Europe?"" she said. ""There
are so many things we cannot compete on. We cannot compete on
taxes, wages or pension ages. Here we have one area where we
still have a worldwide front-runner position and we should take
care to keep that.""
 Some European countries, notably France and Italy, have
raised the prospect of protecting European industries by placing
border tariffs on imports from bigger polluters. But Hedegaard
said premature action could damage global talks and the threat
was enough in itself.
 ""Border tax could be one of the tools in the toolbox,"" she
said. ""I think it should stay there. If we did it right now, how
likely is it we could get a result around the negotiating table?
It's difficult already.""
 
 TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
 An alternative is to pursue sectoral agreements on cutting
greenhouse gases, and Hedegaard said China was proving to be a
valuable partner in this area.
 ""They know they particularly have to address the challenges
within cement, aluminium and steel,"" she said. ""They mentioned
these sectors. And where do we have the biggest threats of
carbon leakage in Europe? Cement, aluminium and steel. We could
cooperate in finding solutions.""
 Sectoral crediting would allow European companies to offset
their emissions by funding cuts in developing countries, focused
on sectors rather than individual companies.
 ""Next month, some experts from my services will go to
Beijing and work with Chinese experts,"" she added. ""This is
really happening. Just two years back it would have been
unthinkable.""
 But while China is a partner in some areas, it is clearly
also a competitor in manufacturing.
 So-called ""technology transfer"" has become a mantra in
international climate talks for poor nations, which say they
need technical help to cut emissions. The latest United Nations
negotiating text lists it as a top priority.
 But Hedegaard described a more nuanced approach.
 ""Technology cooperation has been more in focus in recent
years, and technology dissemination,"" she said. ""Nobody foresees
we should just give away our technology and make it even easier
for China or others to compete with us.""

(Adds comment)
 MADRID, June 18 (Reuters) - Spain plans to issue a new
10-year syndicated bond in the third quarter, the Treasury said,
the same quarter as a 24 billion euro ($30 billion) repayments
crunch which falls in July.
 It also plans 5 regular bond issues during the quarter. The
Treasury did not give a date for the issue of the syndicated
bond. The bond auction timetable was in line with expectations,
one analyst said.
 ""It's a regular issuance, but it's quite a test for the
market. We haven't seen syndicated deals for quite some time so
this could be one of the first,"" said Wilson Chin, senior debt
strategist at ING in Amsterdam.
 ""Issuers were waiting for signs risk appetite has
increased,"" he said.
Spain on Thursday pushed through the sale of 3.5 billion
euros of 10- and 30-year bonds, albeit at a high premium,
sparking a relief rally in the euro and European stocks hit by
speculation of a Greek-style bail-out for Spain.
 One analyst said it made sense for Spain to call for a
syndicated bond.
 ""At the moment, it may be important to make sure that they
will be able to find 10-year funding. So in current
circumstances, it makes sense to call for a syndicated bond,""
said Patrick Jacq, strategist at BNP Paribas.
 Madrid, which must settle 16.2 billion euros in bond
redemptions and around 8 billion euros of treasury bills next
month, flagged plans to issue a 3-year benchmark on Aug. 5;
5-year benchmarks on July 1 and Sept. 2; a 15-year benchmark on
July 15 and a 30-year benchmark on Sept. 16.
 An Economy Ministry source told Reuters on Thursday the
Treasury had sold enough debt to deal with the July repayments.
[ID:nLDE65G1KX]
 The Treasury drew strong demand at Thursday's sale of 10-
and 30-year bonds, hitting the top of its target range. The
10-year average yield was 4.864 percent compared with 4.045
percent at the previous auction on May 20, while the 30-year
yield jumped to 5.908 percent from 4.758 percent on March 18.
 Spain's 10-year bond spread against Germany narrowed on
Friday after it hit a new euro lifetime high ahead of the bond
sale on Thursday, hitting 204 basis points at 0950 GMT.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - World stocks rose for a ninth
day running on Friday, extending a modest rally, and the euro
held at three-week highs as the worst fears about euro zone
sovereign debt receded.
 Banks were among the biggest gainers in Europe as investors
welcomed a commitment from EU policymakers to publish 'stress
tests' revealing the true financial health of the region's
biggest lenders.
 MSCI's all-country world index gained about 0.2 percent,
allowing U.S. and European shares to retrace all their losses
for this year. The index has now rebounded around 7 percent
since its June 7 close and gained more than 3 percent this week.
 Its emerging markets counterpart outperformed and was up
more than half a percent.
 Investors have gradually been moving back into riskier
assets this month after a sharp correction in May made
valuations more attractive and key volatility gauges, such as
Wall St's Vix index, almost halved from mid-May peaks.
 Soothing investor tensions further, Spain's Treasury managed
to sell 3.5 billion euros of debt on Thursday, which a
government official said gave it enough liquidity to deal with a
24 billion euro ($29.4 billion) repayments crunch in July.
 In addition, EU leaders and officials on Friday firmed up
plans to publish bank ""stress tests"" next month as they looked
to minimize adverse speculation that has been dogging the sector
all year.
 Societe Generale, BBVA and Credit Agricole up 1.4-2.7
percent in a higher bank sector.
 ""There has been a slight change in sentiment,"" said Mike
Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities, in
London. ""It looks like the (EU) policy effort is beginning to
come to fruition. Apart from the financial stability programme,
I quite like the idea of the stress test for the banks. Markets
have been oversold, giving a buying opportunity.""
 European stocks were 0.3 percent higher at midday. Japan's
Nikkei ended flat but had its biggest weekly rise in three
months. The dollar was little changed against a basket of
currencies and on the euro. U.S. stock futures were flat.
 
 EASING THE STRESS
 ""Financial system concerns have eased, and some players are
re-establishing carry trades, seeking higher-yielding assets,""
said Lee Hardman, currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ, summing up the mood.
 Fund tracker EPFR Global reported that more than $37 billion
flowed out of money market funds during the latest week and into
high-yield and emerging market bond funds and global equity
funds. Emerging market equity finds saw the most net inflows in
10 weeks.
The euro held at three-week highs, on track for its second
straight week of gains. It was near $1.24 as investors shed
short positions after solid demand at the Spanish government
bond auction.
 The single currency has gained more than 2 percent so far
this week, pulling further away from a four-year low of $1.1876
struck on June 7.
 On debt markets, two-year bond yields were 3 basis points
higher at 0.546 percent, with 10-year yields up the same at
2.702 percent.

 TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - Japan's new government on Friday
pledged to slash corporate tax to meet its economic growth
target of 2 percent in the coming decade that many economists
said was too ambitious.
 In the short term, the government said it aimed to defeat
deflation that has plagued the country for much of the past 20
years within two years, setting a timeframe for the first time,
and called upon the Bank of Japan to ""do its utmost"" to help
with the task.
 The government unveiled its growth strategy less than a
week before it is due to announce plans on how to tackle its
massive debt and ahead of upper house elections on July 11, and
is hoping to win the public's confidence in its ability to
steer the world's second largest economy.
 By stimulating demand in clean energy and other areas with
growth potential, the government aims to lift real economic
growth to more than 2 percent on average and nominal growth to
3 percent over the next 10 years.
 But the plan met with scepticism from some investors.
 ""The growth targets don't sound like anything new to me,
just wishful thinking,"" said Junko Nishioka, chief economist
Japan at RBS Securities.
 Nishioka said the growth targets, outlined by the
government in December, will be hard to meet given that Japan's
real growth rate hovered at 1.3 percent on average in the
decade before the global financial crisis.
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has made fiscal reform a top
priority since taking office last week, said on Thursday that
""without a strong economy, strong public finances and a strong
social security system would not be possible"".
 He said that doubling the 5 percent sales tax was an option
to curb the country's massive debt, that is about twice the
size of the economy.
 The government also said the effects of policies for
boosting demand and jobs would be maximised if the public
shoulders the costs of expanding social welfare.
 Economists say the government needs to commit to raising
the sales tax to 15 percent or even 20 percent over the next 10
to 15 years to pay for rising social welfare costs and a
commitment to hike tax is needed to make its fiscal plans look
credible.
 But National Strategy Minister Satoshi Arai, in charge of
both growth strategy and fiscal plans, said Friday there will
likely be no mention of sales tax in the fiscal plans, which
are expected to come out on June 22.
 Kan told reporters on Friday evening a sales tax hike to 10
percent would be necessary to largely cover growing social
welfare costs for the elderly. He did not specify the reasoning
behind the proposed scale of the tax increase on Thursday.
 WANTS BOJ EFFORTS ON DEFLATION
 The government in its economic growth strategy called on
the Bank of Japan to ""do its utmost"" to beat deflation and said
fiscal and monetary policies for ending price falls should help
the country avoid excessive rises in the yen.
 It will aim to achieve a rise in core consumer prices,
which marked their 14th straight month of annual decline in
April, in the next two years, although the plan lacked specific
policies on how it would achieve it.
 The BOJ has forecast that core consumer prices would rise
slightly in fiscal 2011/12, while predicting 2.0 percent
economic growth for the same year, quicker than 1.8 percent
estimated for this fiscal year.
 The government also pledged to lower the country's
corporate tax rate aimed at luring foreign businesses and
lifting corporate spending in Japan.
 It said it would slash the tax rate, now around 40 percent
and the highest among G7 countries, by stages to the rates in
major countries, or around 25 percent. But it stopped short of
setting a time frame.
 Italy has the lowest corporate tax rate in the G7 at 27
percent while the United States is at 39 percent, according to
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as
of 2009.
 It also plans capitalise on fast-growing demand in Asia by
focusing on infrastructure among other sectors.
 The government will consider incentives to attract overseas
companies and to set up industrial zones.
 Japan will show its growth strategy and its fiscal reform
plan at a June 26-27 G20 summit in Canada.
 Japan's economy pulled out of the worst recession in
decades in April-June last year and its growth in the first
quarter of this year outpaced that of Europe and the United
States.
 On Friday, the government upgraded its economic assessment
for the first time in three months, pointing to signs of a
self-sustaining recovery.

 * Dollar index vulnerable on the charts, soft vs Swissie
 By Satomi Noguchi
 TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - The euro held at three-week highs
on Friday, on track for its second straight week of gains, while
the dollar appeared vulnerable to further losses after falling
below a key chart level.
 The euro retained gains near $1.24 as investors liquidated
short positions after solid demand at Spanish bond auctions,
which also encouraged some investors to shift funds back to euro
zone bonds from safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, traders said.
 Peripheral European debt markets calmed after the auction,
whetting investors' appetite for riskier assets and supporting
higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand
dollars which touched one-month highs.
 ""While the news flow out of Europe started the week negative,
a good Spanish bond auction overnight and the potential for a
coordinated bank stress test across the euro area ... has
bolstered investor confidence that European officials are
beginning to get things right,"" Barclays Capital said in a note
to clients.
 The euro rose as far as $1.2414, a three-week peak, and held
at $1.2400 after gaining 0.6 percent on Thursday.
 It has advanced more than 2 percent so far this week,
overcoming a Moody's downgrade of Greece's credit rating to junk
status and pulling further away from a four-year low of $1.1876
struck on June 7.
 Traders said there were some light stops lined up above the
day's high, with near-term resistance at $1.2457, the single
currency's 2009 low hit during the global financial crisis.
 The spread between Spanish government bond yields and
benchmark German Bunds narrowed from a euro lifetime high after
Thursday's auction.
 The euro was also being helped by broad dollar weakness after
a rise in jobless claims and weaker-than-expected manufacturing
data on Thursday prompted investors to scale back expectations of
a rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
 ""I still think the euro is a sell into rallies and I expect
it to see resistance at $1.25,"" said Gregg Gibbs, currency
strategist at RBS, Sydney.
 European leaders agreed on Thursday to publish details of
stress tests showing the financial health of individual banks
next month and to toughen budget rules to restore confidence in
their currency union.
 Some market players believed the release of stress tests
would boost investor trust in European banks, but others were
concerned they could reveal fragility in the sector and hurt the
euro.
 The dollar index was at 85.57, down 0.1 percent after
brushing a one-month low at 85.491. Technically it looked
vulnerable to a further fall after it broke through support at
85.85, with traders and analysts citing the 85.13 area -- its May
21 low -- after a bearish reversal in the previous session.
 ""If that level goes, then you'll probably see a bit more
capitulation (from dollar longs) on that front,"" said Sue Trinh,
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong.
 The dollar was marginally lower at 90.88 yen, having fallen
0.5 percent in the previous session after the
weaker-than-expected U.S. data.
 Trinh said there was some talk of stop-loss sell orders below
90.75 yen.
 The Japanese government in its economic growth strategy
called on the Bank of Japan to ""do its utmost"" to beat deflation
and said fiscal and monetary policies for ending price falls
should help the country avoid excessive rises in the yen.
 Analysts said the wording on the forex policy may have
sounded less aggressive than expected for some market players who
had expectations for drastic steps to weaken the yen, helping the
yen's rise. But the overall reaction was limited, traders said.
 The Swiss franc was also firm, having rallied after
Switzerland's central bank backed off its pledge to fight
excessive currency strength now that deflation risks have
receded. For details, see
 The dollar held at 1.1114 francs after revisiting a one-month
low of 1.1095. The euro was slightly lower at 1.3775 francs, not
far from a record low of 1.3735 on EBS hit on June 9.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was up 0.2 percent at
$0.8693, after touching a one-month high at $0.8714, boosted by
better risk appetite. The NZ dollar likewise was holding just
below a one-month high of $0.7068.

 * Sentiment hurt by stronger yen amid Europe debt crisis
 * Investors concerned euro zone impact to continue
 * Support for ruling party jumps after PM Kan takes helm
 By Chikafumi Hodo and Mari Terawaki
 TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - Japanese retail investor sentiment
towards domestic stocks sank to its lowest level in four months
in June as worry about the euro zone's debt troubles hammered
Tokyo shares and pushed the yen sharply higher, a Reuters survey
showed.
 The monthly poll also showed a jump in support for the
governing Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) after it chose Prime
Minister Naoto Kan to replace unpopular Yukio Hatoyama, with 42
percent of respondents saying they would vote for the DPJ in
July's upper house elections.
 Retail investor sentiment had turned positive for the first
time since July 2007 only two months ago but has since plunged
due to fears that Europe's debt crisis would affect other
economies, and investors braced for further fallout ahead.
 ""Worsening sovereign risk in Europe is going to have a bad
effect on the economy. This is expected to continue for a while,""
said an investor in his 60s.
 The Reuters sentiment index, calculated by subtracting the
percentage of investors who say they are bearish from those who
are bullish, plunged 28 points to minus 44 in June -- the lowest
reading since February.
 Sentiment towards all sectors worsened in June, notably a
22-point fall in the materials sector and a 16-point drop in the
IT and hi-tech space.
 The survey of 887 respondents was conducted June 7-10, during
which time the benchmark Nikkei average fell to a six-month low
of 9,378.23. The Nikkei has dropped 16 percent since reaching an
18-month high of 11,408.17 in April.
 Many investors said they were concerned about the strength of
the yen, which surged more than 10 percent against the euro last
month. A stronger yen erodes exporters' earnings when repatriated
and hurts their sales competitiveness overseas.
 ""It's difficult to be bullish as the yen's strong trend could
hurt corporate earnings, which have been showing signs of
improvement,"" an investor in his 50s said.
 On the political front, the ruling Democrats reclaimed the
top spot in support among retail investors. The poll showed that
42 percent of respondents would vote for the DPJ in next month's
upper house elections, a 16-percentage-point jump from last
month's poll after Kan took the helm as prime minister.
 The Your Party, a reformist party launched last year, slipped
to second place with 24.5 percent, down more than 10 points from
May. The party had been in the No.1 spot the previous two months.
 Retail investors said they wanted the government to take
measures to boost the economy.
 The survey showed that 39 percent of respondents said the
government's top priority was to take economic stimulus measures,
followed by 11 percent who favoured steps to beat deflation.

 * Says yuan has not been a topic at previous G20 summits
 * Says world economy faces uncertainty, especially euro
debt
 (Adds details)
 By Simon Rabinovitch and Aileen Wang
 BEIJING, June 18 (Reuters) - China told the rest of the
world on Friday not to meddle with the way it manages the yuan,
calling the exchange rate a sovereign matter for it alone to
decide and all but ruling it out of bounds at next week's G20
summit.
 Beijing is under pressure from Washington in particular to
let the yuan rise in value to help reduce the large U.S. trade
deficit with China, and financial markets expect the issue to
loom large at the Group of 20 meeting in Canada on June 26 and
27.
 But senior officials brushed aside that idea.
 ""The RMB is China's currency, so I don't think it is an
issue that should be discussed internationally,"" Cui Tiankai, a
vice foreign minister who is China's G20 sherpa, the official
in charge of preparing for the summit, told a news briefing.
 China has kept the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB),
steady around 6.83 per dollar for almost two years to help its
exporters ride out the global financial crisis. Many Western
economists believe it is undervalued by as much as 40 percent.
 Zhang Tao, head of the central bank's international
department, said that as far as he knew the yuan had never been
discussed at previous G20 summits.
 ""The Chinese government will decide on its foreign exchange
rate policy according to both domestic and global economic
situations,"" Zhang said.
 The yuan rose to a one-month high against the dollar in
offshore forwards on Friday as investors bet that China might
eventually cave in to growing pressure to let the yuan rise in
value. For the yuan market report, click on:
 UNCERTAINTIES
 While the global economic recovery was unfolding more
strongly than expected, it was facing multiple uncertainties,
Zhang said.
 Foremost among these was the euro zone's debt morass, Vice
Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao added.
 ""The global economy is in the process of recovering, but
still faces uncertainties, especially the European debt
crisis,"" he said.
 The European Union is China's biggest trading partner, and
although China's overall exports have recovered to pre-crisis
levels Beijing remains concerned that the world economy is not
yet on a stable footing.
 How swiftly countries should unwind the super-loose fiscal
aand monetary policies they introduced to counter the global
crisis will be high on the agenda at the G20 summit in Toronto.
 Debt-averse Germany is pressing for a rapid reduction in
budget deficits, while the United States and France fear deep
cuts could derail the economic recovery.
 Straddling the two camps, Zhu said countries with serious
budget deficits should accelerate fiscal consolidation but in a
manner that is ""growth-friendly"".
 On the question of how global financial regulation should
be reformed, Zhu said a key principle was that countries should
chart their own paths based on their own economic conditions.
 But, as general goals, he said the Group of 20 wealthy and
emerging nations should work to strengthen banks' capital and
liquidity requirements.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2010 10:42PM ET</span>",RPT-Q+A-Is China finished as a low-wage manufacturer?," (Repeating item first sent on June 17)
 By Alan Wheatley, China Economics Editor
 BEIJING, June 17 (Reuters) - A string of strikes over
higher pay demands at foreign-owned factories in southern China
is prompting investors to ask whether the country's days as the
low-cost workshop of the world are numbered.
 Here are some questions and answers about the implications
of the wage increases.
 HOW FAST IS PAY GOING UP?
 -- Some of the recent disputes have brought sizeable rises,
including a 66 percent increase for eligible workers at
electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn and 20 percent or
more for some Honda Motor employees.
 -- Various cities are raising their minimum wage by 20
percent. But multinational companies generally pay well above
this threshold in any case. Moreover, the increase is just
making up for a freeze in the minimum wage imposed in 2009 to
help exporters ride out the global economic crisis.
 -- Drawing on surveys and anecdotal evidence, Tao Wang,
UBS's chief China economist, expects average wages across China
to rise this year by about 15-20 percent.
 -- That sounds like a lot, but the economy grew 16 percent
a year in nominal terms between 2004 and 2009 and 12 percent
annually for the five years before that. And wages were not far
behind.
 ""Wages have been rising in urban China at least 15 percent
per year, every year for the last decade,"" Nicholas Lardy, a
China scholar at the Peterson Institute for International
Economics in Washington, told Reuters Insider television.
 CAN EMPLOYERS AFFORD MUCH HIGHER PAY?
 -- On the face of it, yes. Wages make up about 5 percent of
overall manufacturing costs. Thanks to rapid productivity
growth, unit labour costs in manufacturing have risen no more
than inflation, UBS estimates, thus causing neither a profit
squeeze nor an inflation spike.
 -- In support of the argument that firms have been able to
cope with steadily rising wages, average profit margins in
China's industrial sector have been quite stable in the past
decade except for a swoon during the crisis year of 2008.
 -- But it is important not to see rising pay in isolation.
Other inputs, such as land, energy and water, are also getting
dearer. The government raised natural gas prices by 25 percent
on June 1.. A labour law introduced in 2008 designed to
strengthen workers' rights has also added to costs. And China
is under pressure to let the yuan resume its rise.
 HOW ARE COMPANIES RESPONDING?
 -- Low-value-added industries with slim margins such as
textiles, light manufacturing and electronics are moving to
cheaper locations in central and western China. This is smack
in line with the government's development strategy.
 -- Some firms, Chinese as well as foreign-owned, are also
moving production to lower-cost neighbours such as Vietnam,
Bangladesh and India -- just as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and
others have shifted manufacturing down the years to China.
 -- As China's price advantage is eroded, the incentive will
grow for international companies to move part of their
production out of Asia altogether, both to save on transport
costs and to be able to supply consumer markets more quickly.
 -- Anecdotal evidence suggests that Mexico, eastern Europe
and even north Africa are benefitting at the margin from this
trend. But for high-volume buyers, China's vast manufacturing
capacity, first-rate infrastructure and clusters of suppliers
mean it is unlikely to have a serious rival for years to come.
 WHAT'S THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT ON INFLATION AND PROFITS?
 -- Most economists reckon the near-term impact on inflation
will be muted because big pay increases are restricted to
southern China's export strongholds.
 -- But corporate margins could be squeezed if wage growth
exceeds productivity gains this year. That is because the price
of Chinese exports is determined internationally and so few
manufacturers have the power to pass on higher costs.
 -- Next year could be a whole new ball game. Investment
bank CICC says labour market tightness today could give way to
serious unemployment as firms turn cautious about hiring and
China's 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) stimulus package is
completed.
 -- CICC estimates that government pump-priming created 25
million temporary jobs during 2009-2010. As they are shed, the
bank reckons total urban unemployment could reach a staggering
40 million in 2011.
 WHAT'S THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR JOBS AND WAGES?
 -- Even if supply and demand put a lid on wages again next
year, the spate of wage increases may be a harbinger of a
turning point in the Chinese economy.
 -- Demographers agree that China's working-age population
will peak around 2015-2016. Surplus labour will therefore
shrink, even as farmers continue to leave the land for
better-paying urban jobs.
 -- That will generate structural upward pressure on wages,
reversing a steep fall in labour's share of national income to
39.7 percent of GDP today from 53 percent in 1999. The figures
for the United States and Japan, by comparison, are 57 percent
and 51 percent, respectively, according to CICC.
 -- In short, Chinese workers will have more money to spend,
while the capital share of national income will shrink. This
will squeeze corporate profits, which have jumped to 31 percent
of GDP from 19 percent in 1999.
 -- Japan's experience offers a guide to this likely
rebalancing. Japan's ratio of labour income to GDP rose to 55
percent in 1983 from 39 percent in 1961, turning household
consumption into the major driver of economic growth, CICC
said.
 -- The corollary of rising wages is rising inflation. After
Japan's workforce started to shrink, its inflation averaged 5.6
percent from 1960-1972; in South Korea, the comparable figure
from 1982-1996 was 5.2 percent, said Wensheng Peng, chief China
economist at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong.
 -- Peng said Chinese monetary policy was likely to
accommodate the rising wages that population trends suggest are
inevitable. ""If the monetary authorities tighten policy to hold
inflation at low levels, it may unnecessarily depress the rate
of economic growth,"" he said.

growth
 * Vows to cut corporate tax to boost corp investment, jobs
 * Analysts sceptical about feasibility of growth strategy
 By Rie Ishiguro
 TOKYO, June 18 (Reuters) - Japan pledged on Friday to
conquer deflation in the year from next April and boost the
economy in coming years by ramping up spending in growth areas,
as it shifts policy gears to fix its tattered public finances.
 The government unveiled its growth strategy less than a
week before it is due to announce plans on how to tackle its
massive debt and ahead of upper house elections on July 11, and
is hoping to win the public's confidence in its ability to
steer the world's second largest economy.
 By stimulating demand in clean energy and other areas with
growth potential, the government aims to lift real economic
growth to more than 2 percent on average and nominal growth to
3 percent over the next 10 years.
 But the plan met with scepticism from some investors.
 ""The growth targets don't sound like anything new to me,
just wishful thinking,"" said Junko Nishioka, chief economist
Japan at RBS Securities.
 Nishioka said the growth targets are hard to meet given
that Japan's real growth rate hovered at 1.3 percent on average
in the decade before the global financial crisis.
 Others say it is unclear how much impact the growth
strategy will have on the economy as it lacks details.
 ""The point is whether the government will be able to show a
detailed scenario to achieve such goals to gain market
confidence, said Yoshiki Shinke, a senior economist at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute.
 ""I cannot make a comprehensive assessment until the
government unveils more details, and it must do so quickly.""
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has made fiscal reform a top
priority since taking office last week, said on Thursday that
""without a strong economy, a strong public finance and a strong
social security system would not be possible"".
 He said that doubling the 5 percent sales tax was an option
to curb the country's massive debt, that is about twice the
size of the economy.
 The government also said the effects of policies for
boosting demand and jobs would be maximised if the public
shoulders the costs of expanding social welfare.
 The government is expected to unveil on June 22 a medium-
and long-term plan to rein in bulging public debt.
 WANTS BOJ EFFORTS ON DEFLATION
 The government in its economic growth strategy called on
the Bank of Japan to ""do its utmost"" to beat deflation and said
fiscal and monetary policies for ending price falls should help
the country avoid excessive rises in the yen.
 It will aim to achieve stable inflation rates in the next
two years and end for good the deflation that has plagued the
country for much of the past 20 years.
 The government also pledged to lower the country's
corporate tax rate, now around 40 percent and one of the
highest among industrial countries, by stages to the rates in
major countries, or around 25 percent. But it stopped short of
setting a time frame.
 It also mapped out various steps for capitalising on
fast-growing demand in Asia, such as creating a market worth
19.7 trillion yen ($217 billion) for its overseas
infrastructure projects and boosting revenues from sectors such
as fashion and films to 1 trillion yen.
 The government will also consider introducing tax breaks
and other incentives to prompt overseas companies to relocate
their Asian headquarters to Japan, as well as setting up
globally competitive industrial zones that offer deregulation
and tax incentives.
 The government plans to boost the market for renewable
energy such as solar power to 10 trillion yen by 2020.
 In the financial sector, it aims to create a comprehensive
exchange for trading securities, commodities and other
financial products by fiscal 2013/14.
 The BOJ earlier this week detailed its new loan scheme
aimed at beating deflation over the longer term, saying it
would provide up to 3 trillion yen to industries with growth
potential.
 Japan's economy pulled out of the worst recession in
decades in April-June last year and its growth in the first
quarter of this year outpaced that of Europe and the United
States.
 But because of anaemic domestic demand, core consumer
prices marked their 14th straight month of annual decline in
April.

 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 18 (Reuters) - The euro held steady near
three-week highs on Friday, as investors liquidated short
positions after a robust response to Spanish bond auctions, while
the U.S. dollar appeared vulnerable to a sell-off.
 Peripheral European debt markets calmed after the auction,
whetting investors' appetite for riskier assets and supporting
higher-yielding currencies like the Australian  and New
Zealand dollars  which hovered near one-month highs.
 In early Asian trade, the euro  was at $1.2384, having
gained 0.6 percent on Thursday, when it rose to as high as
$1.2413. It has advanced more than 2 percent so far this week, on
track for its second straight week of gains and pulling away from
a four-year low of $1.1876 struck on June 7.
 Traders said there were some light stops lined up above
$1.2413 with near-term resistance at $1.2455, the single
currency's 2009 low hit during the global financial crisis.
 The spread between Spanish government bond yields and
benchmark German Bunds narrowed from a euro lifetime high after
Thursday's auction.
 The euro was also being helped by some soft U.S. economic
numbers which saw the greenback cede ground as investors pushed
back chances of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
 ""The euro is being helped by a short-covering rally, mainly
due to some good news out of Spanish bond auction and soft U.S.
economic numbers,"" said Gregg Gibbs, currency strategist at RBS,
Sydney. ""But I still think the euro is a sell into rallies and I
expect it to see resistance at $1.25.""

 The dollar index <.DXY> was at 85.68 and technically it was
looking vulnerable to a further fall after its broke through
support around the 85.85 area. In the short term, the dollar
index could fall to as low as 85.13 -- the May 21 low -- given
the previous session's bearish reversal.
 The dollar was marginally lower at 90.85 yen , having
fallen 0.5 percent in the previous session after the
weaker-than-expected U.S. data.
 The Swiss franc  was also firm, having rallied after
Switzerland's central bank backed off its pledge to fight
excessive currency strength now that deflation risks have
receded. For details, see [ID:nLDE65E1W2]
 The dollar was at 1.1102 francs, not far from a one-month low
of 1.1091 struck in the previous session. The euro was slightly
lower on the franc  at 1.3768, not far from a record low
of 1.3731 hit on June 9.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar hovered near one-month highs
of $0.8688, boosted by better risk appetite. The NZ dollar
likewise held just below a one-month high of $0.7061, at $0.7035.

 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a late
rally on Thursday, overcoming weak economic data that added to
worries about a fragile recovery, while European shares and the
euro gained on reassuring demand for Spanish government bonds.
 A spurt of buying momentum in a choppy session drove gains
as U.S. equities built on a break in the benchmark S&P 500
index above its 200-day moving average earlier this week.
 Prices for gold rose on a combination of safe-haven demand
and the weaker U.S. dollar. Crude oil prices slipped on the
disappointing economic data.
 A plunge in an index of factory activity in the U.S.
mid-Atlantic region in June to its lowest level since August
2009 added to worries that a tepid U.S. economic recovery is
fizzling. [ID:nN17165505]
 Higher-than-expected weekly claims for U.S. jobless
benefits and the largest drop in U.S. consumer prices in nearly
1-1/2 years also weighed on U.S. shares and caused European
shares to pare early gains. [ID:nN17254724]
 U.S. equities drove higher in the last 30 minutes of trade.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 24.71 points, or
0.24 percent, to close at 10,434.17. The Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> gained 1.43 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,116.04.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> climbed 1.23 points, or 0.05

the market just yet, we still have quite a bit of momentum,""
said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in
Jersey City, New Jersey.
 Apple Inc  touched a lifetime high at $272.90 a day
after the company said its new iPhone set a record sales pace
with orders of more than 600,000. Apple shares ended up 1.7
percent at $271.87.

discretionary shares were a drag on markets, with home goods
retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc  down 7.6 percent to
$41.70. The S&P retail index <.RLX> was off 1.25 percent.
 Consumer spending typically accounts for about two-thirds
of U.S. economic activity, making the weak labor market a
source of ongoing concern.

 EUROPEAN DEBT SALES
 The euro rose against the dollar after Spain's ability to
sell bonds soothed worries about the country's public finances
and squeezed short positions by investors who had been betting
against the single currency.
 The euro rose 0.64 percent versus the dollar to $1.2385
. The greenback also fell against the yen, down 0.48
percent to 90.98 yen  as the weak U.S. data increased
risk aversion.
 Spain's auction of 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) worth
of 10-year and 30-year government bonds drew strong demand,
although it paid a hefty premium compared with previous issues
of the same paper.
 While the debt succeeded in finding buyers, analysts
remained cautious about Spain's funding prospects.
 ""Spain ... wanted to show it could issue paper without
problems. But they paid a lot to get the paper away,"" said Huw
Worthington, a bond strategist at Barclays Capital in London.
 The well-covered auction helped narrow the spread of
Spanish yields over benchmark Bunds from an earlier euro
lifetime high of 237 basis points.  
 The spread snapped back after the auction and was last at
214 basis points.
 ""The strong demand for Spanish bonds should help restore
confidence, said Ciaran O'Hagan, strategist at Societe
Generale.
 The two-year Schatz yield  was up 2.6 basis
points at 0.528 percent, while the 10-year Bund yield
 was down 1.4 bps at 2.664 percent.

1.24 percent, to $1245.90. U.S. light sweet crude oil 
fell 88 cents, or 0.88 percent, to $76.79 per barrel.

 TORONTO, June 17 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar fell on
Thursday, while bonds charged higher, as investors became more
guarded after several data releases suggested a tepid economic
recovery.
 Earlier, the Canadian dollar climbed as investors took on
more risk following Spanish bond issues that drew strong
demand, which kept concerns about Europe's debt troubles at
bay. [ID:nLDE65G1HJ]

dollar, or 97.37 U.S. cents, down from Wednesday's finish at
C$1.0254 to the U.S. dollar, or 97.52 U.S. cents.
 ""It's a big underperformer on the day. We can attribute
that to the weak read on the Philadelphia Fed index and

mid-Atlantic region braked to its slowest pace in 10 months in

 Disappointing wholesale trade figures for April in Canada
and an unexpected rise in new weekly U.S. claims for jobless
aid put pressure on the Canadian currency.
 Also, U.S. consumer prices notched their largest decline in
nearly 1-1/2 years in May.
 The soft data also took its toll on other markets, such as
oil and equities, which are often influential to the movement
in Canada's currency. Oil was off more than 1 percent to settle
below $77 a barrel. North American equity markets finished with
mild gains.
 ""It feels like the market is generally taking a more
cautious turn again,"" said Eric Lascelles, chief Canada macro
strategist, at TD Securities.
 ""Part of it is the U.S. economic figures are looking soft,
which is raising some doubt about the global recovery.""
 BONDS RISE IN FLIGHT TO SAFETY
 Canadian government bond prices were lifted by the day's
disappointing economic data.
 Spain's auction of 3.5 billion euros of bonds was taken in
stride, easing concerns it may face a Greek-style debt crisis,
but a huge question mark still hangs over the outlook for
sovereign debt. [ID:nLDE65G1HJ]
 ""How many more countries have deficits to become more
transparent. More importantly, even if we know in absolute
terms the deficits that are out there ... just because you get
an auction at a reasonable level of pricing it's a question of
whether the price is correct,"" said Simon Ballard, senior
credit strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
 ""Bottom line is that the euro zone needs restructuring in
order to get away from the inherent problems it has.""
 The two-year government bond  jumped 9 Canadian
cents to yield 1.725 percent, while the 10-year bond

 Canadian bonds put in a mixed performance against U.S.

plans to toughen budget rules and improve coordination of
economic policy at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.
 Following are details of the agreement, meant to show
financial markets the EU can contain a debt crisis.
 
 ENHANCING ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
 * EU member states reaffirmed their position that better
economic policy coordination is a crucial and urgent priority.
 * They reaffirmed a commitment by individual states to take
additional measures to accelerate fiscal consolidation where
needed, with priority given to spending restraint.
 * Leaders reviewed the findings of a task force set up to
deepen policy coordination and agreed on broad policy goals. A
firm agreement will be reached only after the group makes its
final recommendations in October.
 * These broad policy goals include:
 - Countries that fail to meet budgetary and debt targets set
out by the Stability and Growth Pact should face sanctions.
 - EU states should submit their ""stability and convergence
programmes"" for coming years from 2011 onwards each spring;
taking into account national budgetary procedures.
 - The quality of statistical data should be ensured and
statistical offices should be fully independent.
 - EU states will develop a scoreboard to assess
competitiveness developments and imbalances to allow for early
detection of unsustainable or dangerous trends.
 - An effective surveillance framework should be developed,
reflecting the particular situation of euro zone members.
 
 STRESS TESTS FOR BANKS
 * All EU countries will publish the results of stress tests
on their banks in the second half of July at the latest to boost
investor confidence in the financial sector.
 
 FINANCIAL SECTOR TAXES
 * The EU will call for imposing a transaction tax on
financial institutions at the G20 summit next week as well as a
levy on banks to help pay for any costs associated with
repairing the banking system.
 * The European Commission and EU finance ministers will work
out details for a European levy on financial institutions by
October. This should include the size or how revenues should be
used.
 
 REGULATORY SUPERVISION
 * EU states pledged to move fast on key legislative measures
to create new supervisory bodies that could start work in 2011.
 
 LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR GROWTH
 * A long-term strategy to boost sustainable growth, create
jobs and even out economic differences, known as ""Europe 2020"",
was adopted. It includes the following targets:
 - raising employment rates for women and men aged 20-64 to
75 percent;
 - improving conditions for research and development;
 - reducing greenhouse emissions by 20 percent compared to
1990 levels; increasing the share of renewables in final energy
consumption to 20 percent; moving towards a 20 percent increase
in energy efficiency;
 - lowering school drop-out rates; raising higher education
levels;
 - reducing poverty and social inclusions.

 * Says Britain is an ""engaged, active"" partner in EU debate
 * Britain's opt-outs, interests will be defended, he says

(Updates after summit)
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron
declared himself successful in defending Britain's national
interests after his first European Union summit on Thursday, and
said he intended to be an active player in EU affairs.
 After a day-long gathering of EU leaders to discuss closer
economic cooperation and stricter budget rules, Cameron said he
had ensured Britain would retain oversight of its budget, while
not removing itself or marginalising itself in Europe.
 Keen to impress on a domestic audience that his coalition
with the more pro-European Liberal Democrats would not surrender
powers to Brussels, Cameron told British reporters after the
summit that he had secured key opt-outs on financial issues.
 ""This was a European Council that delivered good outcomes
for Britain,"" Cameron said. ""It makes it clear in the final text
that ... member states competencies shall not be altered,"" he
said, referring to Britain's retention of key powers.
 At the same time, he sought to paint Britain as close to
Europe, saying it had a vested interest in ensuring that the 16
countries that share the euro single currency weathered and
bounced back from the debt crisis affecting Greece and Spain.
 ""A stronger European economy will strengthen economic
recovery at home, creating jobs and helping to drive British
exports,"" he said. ""It's in our national interests that there is
a strong and successful euro zone.""
 Earlier, as he began the summit with talks with European
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Cameron laid out the
attitude he wanted to adopt in dealing with his EU partners.
 ""You'll see Britain playing a very positive, a very engaged,
a very active role in the European Union,"" he said.
 
 NATIONAL INTERESTS
 Some EU member states were concerned Britain's new
government, formed after an election last month, would clash
with Europe as it sought to claw back powers seen to have been
lost to Brussels and took more rigid positions on new policy.
 But over the past month, the coalition government has
steered a central course, staying on good terms with Brussels
and even impressing some member states -- for example by sending
a fluent French- and German-speaking minister to meetings.
 The question is how long Cameron and his government can
maintain the balancing act, particularly when discussions over
policy and position intensify, and when the European Parliament
is involved in shaping laws on issues such as regulation. 
 Cameron upset some EU leaders last year by withdrawing his
party from the main centre-right group.
 ""There's a lot of relief that the new government is not as
Eurosceptic as people thought it would be,"" said Charles Grant,
the director of the Centre for European Reform think tank. 
 He said there was some regret that Britain was not more
closely involved in dealing with the euro zone debt crisis and
some other issues that are being debated. 
 ""Big questions of economic governance are being debated and
Britain is ... marginalised and not really involved,"" he said.
 Thursday's summit could go some way to showing how Britain
can manage to defend its interests and shape the EU debate. But
Britain still has a long way to go to defend its interests when
it comes to financial market regulation and other pieces of
legislation set to be determined by the EU in the months ahead.

 (Adds detail)
 By Sakari Suoninen
 FRANKFURT, June 17 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers
should be the guardians of fiscal sustainability in the
16-country bloc, the European Central Bank said on Thursday.
 ""For the euro area, the Eurogroup should assume a shared
responsibility for sound national fiscal policies,"" the ECB said
in its preliminary proposals for the reform of the economic
governance framework.
 ""The Eurogroup, as the guardian of fiscal sustainability,
should review in detail national budgetary plans, consider the
risk of adverse spill-over effects and agree on a number of
precise ex ante fiscal policy guidelines.""
 The ECB thinks all countries should feel responsible for
each other's fiscal policies.
 ""The ECB favours ... an approach, which should be based on a
genuine sense of co-responsibility of all euro area countries,""
it said.
 Surveillance of fiscal rules should target especially the
countries with biggest problems, the ECB said, and added a new
institution could be founded.
 ""An independent European fiscal agency could be set up under
a mandate from the Eurogroup/Council, acting as its `watchdog'.""
 The ECB said laxity in enforcing sanctions must end and
incentives must be improved.
 ""At the EU level, the European Commission, the Eurogroup and
the EU Council have not been sufficiently stringent in applying
the EU fiscal rules,"" the ECB said.
 ""At the national level, incentives for sustainable fiscal
positions were insufficient.""
 Sanctions for breaching budget deficit rules should be
applied more automatically and an independent EU fiscal agency
should be created.
 Sanctions should also be wider in spectrum and the
independence of fiscal surveillance should be strengthened, the
central bank said.
 ""Financial sanctions could include reduced access to EU
cohesion funds and other types of EU transfers including EU
structural funds and EU subsidies in general.""
 
 CRISIS FUND
 The euro zone is battling the biggest crisis since the
introduction of the common currency as Greece has lost trust in
the markets due to high debt and deficit levels.
 The EU and IMF agreed at the beginning of May to lend Greece
110 billion euros over three years to help it pay billions in
expiring debt after being shut out of financial markets by the
high cost of borrowing.
 
 The ECB said that in case a country runs into difficulties
in the future, aid should not be provided where, ""market
financing is no longer available.""
 It also said it could support the establishment of a
euro-zone crisis management institution on the basis of the
European Financial Stability Facility, provided it did not step
on the ECB's territory.
 ""Any new framework needs to respect the independence of the
ECB, and the prohibitions of monetary financing and privileged
access,"" it said.
 Moreover, new rules should not include the threat of
expulsion from the euro zone or the EU, because it would not be
seen as credible.
 There should be sanctions for countries which get aid but do
not comply with conditions, the ECB said, adding its proposals
focus on the 16-country euro zone, but could selectively apply
to the whole EU.
 The central bank made the comments to the European Union
task force, which is led by EU President Herman Van Rompuy.
 The ECB document was dated June 10 and the accompanying
letter to Van Rompuy June 15.

 * Wall Street down after weak U.S. economic data

 * Spot gold rises, crude oil slips
 By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday
after weak economic data added to worries about a fragile
recovery, while European shares and the euro rose after
reassuring demand for Spanish government bonds.
 Prices for gold rose on a combination of safe-haven demand
and a weaker U.S. dollar. Crude oil prices slipped.
 An index of factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic
region in June plunged to its lowest level since August 2009,
adding to worries that a tepid U.S. economic recovery is
fizzling. [ID:nN17165505]
 Higher-than-expected weekly claims for U.S. jobless
benefits and the largest drop in U.S. consumer prices in nearly
1-1/2 years also weighed on U.S. shares and caused European
shares to pare early gains. [ID:nN17254724]
 ""A few months back, the economy seemed to be on better
footing, and now data is casting some doubt about the economic
recovery. People are trying to evaluate that in front of the
earnings season,"" said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at Oakbrook
Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.

percent, to 1,110.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
dropped 5.32 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,300.61.
 U.S. consumer discretionary shares were among the biggest
drags, with home goods retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc 
down 6.65 percent to $42.12 and the S&P retail index <.RLX> off
1.62 percent.
 Consumer spending typically accounts for about two-thirds
of U.S. economic activity, making the weak labor market a
source of ongoing concern.
 European shares closed higher for a seventh straight
session on Thursday, even as the U.S. data diminished risk
appetite.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top European shares
closed up 0.25 percent at 1,041.84 points as solid demand for
Spain's auction of government bonds boosted investor confidence
in the euro zone's economic outlook.
 Oil major BP Plc  surged 6.7 percent a day after it
said it will set up a $20 billion fund for damage claims from
its huge Gulf of Mexico oil spill, sell assets and suspend
dividend payments. the actions removed uncertainty over the
dividend and the size of the funds to cover claims.
[ID:nN16172720]
 EUROPEAN DEBT SALES
 The euro rose against the dollar after Spain's ability to
sell bonds soothed worries about the country's public finances
and squeezed short positions by investors who had been betting
against the single currency.
 The euro rose 0.41 percent against the dollar to $1.2357
.
 Against the yen, the euro dropped 0.20 percent to 112.29
yen . The greenback also fell against the yen, down
0.60 percent to 90.87 yen  as the weak U.S. data
increased risk aversion.
 Spain's auction of 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) worth
of 10-year and 30-year government bonds drew strong demand,
although it paid a hefty premium compared with previous issues
of the same paper.
 While the debt succeeded in finding buyers, analysts
remained cautious about Spain's funding prospects.
 ""Spain ... wanted to show it could issue paper without
problems. But they paid a lot to get the paper away,"" said Huw
Worthington, a bond strategist at Barclays Capital in London.
 The well-covered auction helped narrow the spread of
Spanish yields over benchmark Bunds from an earlier euro
lifetime high of 237 basis points.  
 The spread snapped back after the auction and was last at
214 basis points.
 ""The strong demand for Spanish bonds should help restore
confidence, said Ciaran O'Hagan, strategist at Societe
Generale.
 The two-year Schatz yield  was up 2.6 basis
points at 0.528 percent, while the 10-year Bund yield
 was down 1.4 bps at 2.664 percent.
 Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 19/32 of a point in
price, pushing the yield down to 3.19 percent .
 In commodities, spot gold prices  rose $14.95, or
1.21 percent, to $1245.50. U.S. light sweet crude oil 
fell 96 cents, or 1.24 percent, to $76.71 per barrel.

loss of 6 million euros ($7.4 million) for the year to March 31,

part to improved fuel hedging.
 Air Mauritius said it remained vulnerable to the crisis in

results constitute a significant improvement,"" Chief Executive
Officer Manoj Ujoodha said in a statement.
 Operating profit -- excluding hedge costs -- rose to 32.6
million euros from a 15.3 million euro profit in the previous

compared with a 100.5 million euros a year before.
 The airline said the various marketing campaigns undertaken

 * Stress tests to include more banks, scenarios
 * Governments should provide backstop before disclosure
 * Banks still divided on issue

(Adds German banking association)
 FRANKFURT, June 17 (Reuters) - A new set of European bank
stress tests is needed to include a broader swath of the banking
industry as well as new stress scenarios such as the sovereign
debt crisis, Bundesbank head Axel Weber said on Thursday.
 Speaking at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany, Weber --
also a member of the European Central Bank's governing council
-- said he has pushed for disclosure of the stress test results
""by bank and by country"" on an international level.
 Germany had been sceptical about revealing details of tests
on the financial health and risk exposure of its banks, but has
dropped its objections after France and Spain came out in favour
of a move the Obama administration has pressed Europe to take.
 Weber said there would need to be conditions fulfilled
before the results of any tests were published.
 ""(...) All countries that are impacted (should) enter a
clear political commitment, that if a recapitalisation became
necessary during the course of this stress test ... they would
provide a backstop,"" he said.
 Banks remain undecided on whether disclosure makes sense. 
 In Germany the Association of German Banks, which represents
large private sector lenders such as Deutsche Bank 
and Commerzbank , said it may be open to the idea of
disclosure, providing the results do not leave room for
""misinterpretation.""
 The German association of public sector banks, which
represents the troubled Landesbanken sector, remains opposed to
such a disclosure. 
 Weber's fellow Governing Council members Erkki Liikanen and
Christian Noyer said making stress test results public would
boost confidence. [ID:nLDE65G0WH] [ID:nWEA6552]
 Weber said countries should not implement their own banking
regulations, but coordinate them internationally. There was a
risk of them being politicised, which could hamper harmonising
the future regulations.
 Weber also warned against creating a permanent, pre-financed
mechanism to help out countries in fiscal trouble.
 ""What has to be avoided in any case is the introduction of
permanent support mechanisms,"" Weber said.

 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro rose against the
U.S. dollar on Thursday as strong European government bond
sales eased public finance concerns, but weak U.S. economic
data led U.S. stocks to falter and cut European share gains.
 Spain and France sold a combined 13 billion euros worth

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro climbed on Thursday
to a three-week high against the U.S. dollar after a strong
Spanish government bond sale soothed worries about the
country's finances and triggered a squeeze in short positions.
 Gains in the euro were limited, however, and the dollar
fell sharply versus the yen after disappointing U.S. economic
data fueled risk aversion.
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reported that factory
activity growth plunged in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, and
the Labor Department reported an unexpected rise in U.S.
jobless claims.
 The Swiss franc rallied broadly after the Swiss National
Bank dropped its promise to act decisively against an excessive
rise in the franc and said that for now deflation risks have
largely disappeared.
 ""Philly Fed was slightly weaker than expected and that's
contributed to equities turning around and the pretty
significant gain in the yen,"" said John Doyle, senior currency
strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington. ""In the near
term it causes some worry about the U.S. growth outlook.""
 In late morning trading, the euro rose 0.4 percent to
$1.2357, off a session peak of $1.2413 hit on electronic
trading platform EBS, the highest level since May 28.
 The spread of Spanish government bond yields over benchmark
German Bunds narrowed from a euro lifetime high after the
auction. Technical factors added to the momentum as stop-losses
on stale short positions in the euro were triggered through
$1.2360, traders said.
 Analysts at Action Economics said euro zone central banks
were reportedly among the buyers, along with interest from a
sovereign account.
 The euro has regained more than 5 cents from a four-year
low of $1.1876 set on EBS last week, though it remains more
than 13 percent lower year-to-date.
 Technical analysts at Commerzbank said the euro's
correction could continue toward resistance at $1.2445/1.2570
-- the 2009 low and the 38.2 percent retracement of the move
down from April to June.
 Despite the euro's advance, analysts said worries about
Spanish banks remain and the market will be looking for the
results of bank stress tests which the Spanish central bank
said would be published soon.
 ""The auction went reasonably well but with rising yields
it's not that much of a surprise. There are still worrying
signs for Spain, particularly stresses in the Spanish bank
funding market,"" said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at
BTM-UFJ.
 ""We think the euro rally is being driven by position
adjustment rather than fundamentals in particular,"" Hardman
added.
 European Union leaders moved toward agreement on Thursday
on ways to strengthen budget discipline and economic policy
coordination among the 27 member states to contain a euro zone
debt crisis.
 Against the yen, the euro fell 0.4 percent to 112.07 yen.
The dollar lost 0.8 percent to 90.71 yen, after falling 1
percent earlier to a session low of 90.52.
 The Swiss franc rose versus the euro and the dollar after
the SNB took a step toward tightening its extraordinarily loose
monetary policy, judging that economic recovery is robust
enough to back off a pledge to fight a rise of the Swiss
franc.
 The central bank held interest rates at ultra-low levels as
expected.
 The euro fell from around 1.3877 francs to a session low of
1.3759, according to Reuters data, edging towards its all-time
low of 1.3731 francs hit on June 9.
The dollar hit a one-month low of 1.1096 francs.

this year and only slightly better in 2011, the International

 SEA operates Milan's Malpensa airport, chosen by Lufthansa

billion) over 10 years to boost its infrastructure but tariff
uncertainties have held it back.
 ""We need certain rules to attract capital from the market

Bonomi said. ""Italian (services) tariffs are 40 percent less

to a three-week high against the U.S. dollar after a strong
Spanish bond sale soothed worries about the country's public

over benchmark German Bunds narrowed from a euro lifetime high
after the auction. Technical factors added to the momentum as
stop-losses on stale short positions in the euro were triggered
through $1.2360, traders said.
 The euro was also helped by European equities, which
advanced for a seventh straight session. U.S. stock index
futures rose although they pared gains after data showing an
unexpected rise in U.S. initial jobless claims. See

1506,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2010 08:35AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-China takes new step to boost yuan's global role," * China expands yuan invoicing and settlement pilot scheme
 * Programme is part of plan to internationalise yuan
 * More yuan-denominated assets outside China could follow

 (Adds details)
 By Zhou Xin and Alan Wheatley
 BEIJING, June 17 (Reuters) - China is vastly expanding a
pilot programme to encourage the use of the yuan in cross-border
trade in what economists say is part of a strategy to raise the
profile of the currency on the world stage.
 Citing a decision by the State Council, or cabinet, state
media said the year-old scheme would be extended to the
invoicing and settlement of imports and exports with all China's
trading partners.
 Until now, the only permitted overseas counterparts have
been Hong Kong and Macau -- both Chinese territories -- as well
as the members of the Association of South East Asian Nations.
 ""It is a very positive move in the process of making the
yuan an international currency,"" said Wu Zhifeng, an economist
with China Development Bank in Beijing.
 Companies in 20 Chinese provinces will henceforth be allowed
to trade in yuan. Currently only selected firms in Shanghai and
four cities in the southern province of Guangdong are eligible.
 State media said the new participating provinces include
Heilongjiang, which has been lobbying for approval to conduct
trade settlement with Russia in yuan.
 Economists said the purpose of the scheme was to gradually
make Beijing policymakers and the outside world comfortable with
the wider international use of the yuan, commensurate with
China's growing economic and financial clout in the world.
 ""The first step in making an international currency is to
use it in trade payments,"" said Ding Zhijie, a professor with
the University of International Business and Economics in
Beijing.
 
 MORE YUAN-DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS?
 China retains strict capital controls, which prevent the
yuan from being freely exchanged for purposes other than for
documented trade and investment.
 But the country's leaders also make no secret of wanting to
see the yuan take its place one day as a major global currency.
Invoicing more trade in yuan is a baby step towards the goal of
having a freely traded, convertible currency.
 ""Overall they want to internationalise the yuan by making
more people use it whether for investment purposes, for
corporates to settle trade or for central banks around the world
to use it as a reserve currency,"" said Kelvin Lau, an economist
with Standard Chartered in Hong Kong.
 ""But, of course, this is a very long-term process, and in
the near term it needs to be done step by step. Obviously China
is much more comfortable liberalising the current account than
the capital account,"" he said.
 But Lau said Hong Kong's experience with cross-border use of
the yuan showed that one followed the other; as the volume of
yuan deposits derived from trade had grown, so had the demand
for yuan-denominated investable assets. Hence the increasing
issuance of yuan bonds in Hong Kong.
 Ding agreed that China was likely to expand the channels for
investing in yuan beyond China's borders and to encourage
overseas investors to hold yuan.
 Ding, who has advised the central bank on an ad hoc basis,
said the yuan's gradual internationalisation could lead to its
inclusion in the basket of currencies that make up the Special
Drawing Reserve, an accounting unit used by the International
Monetary Fund.
 Under the IMF's charter, the SDR's components - currently
the dollar, euro, yen and sterling -- must be convertible
currencies.
 By the end of May, trade totalling 44.6 billion yuan had
been invoiced and settled in yuan since the pilot scheme was
launched in July 2009, Xinhua news agency reported, citing the
People's Bank of China.
 That would appear to represent a marked acceleration in the
popularity of the programme. As of the end of February, the
cumulative total was 11.6 billion yuan, according to PBOC
figures cited by Lau in an April report.
 Wu with China Development Bank said it would still take a
long time for the yuan to rival the dollar or the euro.
 ""Yes, the yuan may become more popular, but don't expect it
to become a global currency overnight,"" he said.

 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 17 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan may redirect oil exports to Russia's Black Sea port
of Novorossiisk rather than shipping it to Iran due to sanctions
imposed from June 1, an industry source said on Thursday. 
 Iran, which faces new sanctions imposed last week by the
U.N. Security Council over its nuclear programme, has swap
arrangements with Central Asian producers under which it imports
crude into Caspian ports and supplies the equivalent barrels on
behalf of its partners in the Persian Gulf.
 Kazakhstan has been pumping oil to Iran at a rate of 1.2
million tonnes per year. Turkmenistan exports 2 million tonnes
per year, but it is unclear how much goes to Iran. 
 The source said the Kazakh and Turkmen barrels would be
directed through the Baku-Makhachkala-Novorossiisk pipeline
originating in the Azeri capital on the shore of the Caspian
Sea.
 Turkmenistan also has the technical ability to switch
supplies to the BP-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline.
 The pipeline has a capacity of 5 million tonnes per year but
is only pumping at a rate of 3.5 million at the moment. 
 In April, Russia's second-largest crude producer, LUKOIL,
stopped gasoline sales to Iran because of measures imposed
earlier.

 * Says UBS, Credit Suisse profit potential declined
 * Says leverage still elevated, no room for errors
 * Says bank sector's situation improved but risks stay high
 
 (Adds quotes from SNB's Jordan, UBS, CS comment)
 By Sven Egenter and Katie Reid
 ZURICH/GENEVA, June 17 (Reuters) - Switzerland's global
banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, must hold more and better capital
to absorb losses in the case of another crisis and to limit the
risk of a failure that could drag the economy down, the central
bank said.
 The situation of the two banks along with the whole industry
had improved since the crisis year 2008, the Swiss National Bank
said in its financial stability report published on Thursday,
but risks remained high.
 UBS and Credit Suisse together still hold more than four
times the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in assets on
their balance sheets and had a share of around one third in key
domestic markets, making them too big to fail, the SNB said.
 ""A further strengthening of the capital situation and a
further realignment of the business model in order to achieve
sustainable profitability, are still central challenges facing
the big banks,"" SNB Vice-Chairman Thomas Jordan said at a media
conference following the SNB's interest rate decision.
 In the report, the SNB called for capital requirements that
went beyond the strict measures adopted in 2008.
 ""It is essential that capital requirements be significantly
increased and that they rise in line with the degree of systemic
importance of a bank,"" Jordan said.
 Switzerland led the global push for tighter bank rules
after the government's bailout of UBS in autumn 2008,
introducing higher capital requirements, a leverage ratio, a
stricter liquidity regime and new rules for bankers' pay.
 A government commission has made further proposals,
including changes to the banks' structure to allow a break-up in
the case of insolvency and the introduction of progressive
capital requirements depending on a bank's size.
 ""UBS has been stabilised and delivered a net profit in the
last two quarters, the balance sheet has been reduced and we are
committed to further strengthen our capital base via retained
earnings,"" UBS said in an e-mailed statement.
 Credit Suisse declined to comment on the SNB stability
report, but it reiterated that it had strong capital and
liquidity positions.
 
 NO MARGIN FOR ERRORS
 Under the rules adopted in 2008, UBS and Credit Suisse must
hold twice the international minimum standard in regulatory
capital in good times and meet a leverage ratio of at least 3
percent, rising to 5 percent in good times.
 Both banks already meet the capital requirements with a tier
1 capital ratio of above 16 percent, making them two of the best
capitalised banks in the world according to current standards.
 Bank regulator FINMA has already said that new international
rules, discussed by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision,
may lead to adjustments.
 The banks' leverage was still very high, the SNB said,
especially when excluding hybrid instruments and deferred taxes
from regulatory capital, something the Basel committee is
calling for.
 ""The margin for error that the big banks can afford remains
narrow, and any misjudgment of the risks could have serious
consequences,"" the SNB said. 
 In addition, the banks' ability to absorb losses was limited
by the fact that their profit potential had declined as the
global crackdown on banking secrecy ate into margins in the
highly lucrative wealth management business.
 Especially in the case of UBS, a full recovery of
profitability did not appear very likely, the SNB said.
 The SNB said that the situation of Switzerland's banking
system had improved overall as banks with a domestic focus, such
as the state-owned cantonal banks, held up well throughout the
crisis and the big banks recovered.
 But risks remained high, the SNB warned, because banks faced
losses from foreign loans even under the main scenario of a
gradual recovery of the global economy and first signs of risks
on the Swiss mortgage market also appeared.

 LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - European credit spreads
tightened and there was a further strengthening in primary
market activity underpinned by the successful Spanish bond
auction and a sharp relief rally in BP.
 In the new issue bond market two banks, Deutsche and
Standard Chartered, launched deals to raise lower tier 2
capital, while America Movil brought a multi-currency issue.
 The macro picture was helped by the news from Spain and the
implication this has for sovereign debt concerns, and banks
rallied.
 The Markit iTraxx Western European sovereign index tightened
by 7.5 basis points to 138 basis points, while the iTraxx senior
financials index tightened by 8 basis points to 161 basis
points, Markit said.
 Five-year CDS on Spain was 18 basis points tighter at 240
basis points.
 Following the agreement BP made with the U.S. government,
its five-year credit default swap rallied by 145 basis points
moving to 400 basis points according to Markit.
 This is still a level corresponding to a sub investment

 By 1120 GMT, the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index
was at 124 basis points, according to data from Markit. That is
2.5 basis points tighter versus late on Wednesday, according to

 By Suvashree Dey Choudhury and Neha D'silva
 MUMBAI, June 17 (Reuters) - Indian policymakers said on
Thursday that they were concerned about soaring prices, moving
bond yields off day lows as investors saw a greater chance of
an early interest rate hike despite a slight easing in food and
fuel price inflation.
 Pressure has been mounting on the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) to raise rates ahead of a scheduled July 27 policy review
after the wholesale price index  rose 10.16 percent
in May, the highest level in the G20 group of leading
economies.
 But a slew of sometimes contradictory comments from
government officials and central bankers, and a cash squeeze in
the banking system, have kept the market jittery about possible
tightening moves.
 Many traders expect the central bank will wait until at
least early July to raise rates.
 Most analysts still expect the RBI to wait until its late
July review, especially given tight cash conditions at Indian
banks.
 RBI Deputy Governor K.C. Chakrabarty said on Thursday that
domestic inflation is a bigger concern than other global
factors [ID:nSGE65G07J], and C. Rangarajan, economic adviser to
the prime minister, called inflation levels ""uncomfortable""
[ID:nSGE65G07V]
 Chakrabarty is not directly involved in monetary policy as
other members of board. Rangarajan is seen as having the ear of
Prime Minister Mammohan Singh but has little direct influence
over monetary policy.
 Another RBI deputy governor, Subir Gokarn, who as in charge
of monetary policy is seen as an influential member of the
board, signalled on Wednesday the bank would continue to
tighten but warned against overreacting amid global economic
uncertainties, such as Europe's debt crisis. [ID:nSGE65F04L]
 The 10-year benchmark bond yield  rebounded
to 7.6 percent after the officials' comments on Thursday. It
had earlier fallen to 7.54 percent after the central bank
announced it would buy back 200 billion Indian rupees ($4.3
billion) of bonds to help ease a temporary cash shortage.
[ID:nSGE65F021]
 Cash has been tight in India since late May as about 1.36
trillion rupees has flowed out of the banking system towards
payments for government 3G mobile spectrum and broadband
auctions, and for advance tax payments.
 The Indian banking system will face a shortfall of at least
400 billion-450 billion rupees once payments for broadband
auctions are complete next week, traders estimated, adding the
situation will be clearer when the new reporting fortnight
starts Saturday.
 ""Though people are calling for RBI action, I feel the RBI
will wait and gauge the inflation and liquidity situation for
at least another couple of weeks before deciding on any
action,"" said S. Srinivasaraghavan, treasury head at IDBI
Gilts.
 ""Whatever action they take will only have a lag effect, and
we have to also keep in mind that previous monetary action has
had little impact on inflation as it is largely supply-side
driven,"" he added.
 Inflation in India has remained stubbornly high, adding to
pressure on the central bank as well as the government, which
fears a rapid rise in interest rates could anger voters and
derail the country's strong economic growth.
 Prime Minister Singh's coalition government has already
held back on major economic reforms such as freeing up retail
fuel prices ahead of eight state elections due later in 2010
and 2011.
 Government data on Thursday showed India's food price index
rose 16.12 percent in the year to June 5, though the rate of
growth eased from the previous week's annual reading of 16.74
percent.
 The fuel price index climbed 13.18 percent, compared with
an annual rise of 14.23 percent in the previous week.
 JITTERS PERSIST
 Policymakers and advisers have said inflation is expected
to ease in the coming months on lower food prices and normal
monsoon rains, but their comments have been off the mark in the
past.
 ""It won't be prudent on the part of the RBI to hike rates
at least in June because you have these liquidity issues,"" said
Jay Shankar, an economist at Religare Capital.
 Singh expects the inflation rate to moderate to 5-6 percent
by December.
 The RBI has raised rates twice, by a total of 50 basis
points, since mid-March to curb price pressures and is expected
to deliver another hike of 25 basis points at the July review.
The markets have already priced in such a move.
 Central banks in the region such as those in Australia and
Malaysia have started raising rates as growth rebounds from the
global slowdown. But some Asian banks have paused in their
tightening to see if the euro zone's debt crisis will
jeopardise the global economic recovery.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro hit a three-week high
versus the dollar on Thursday as worries about Spain's public
finances were eased by a well covered bond auction, triggering
stop-losses on stale short positions in the single currency.
 The Swiss franc rose as the Swiss National Bank relaxed its
interventionist stance and said deflationary risks in the Swiss
economy had all but disappeared.
 The spread of Spanish government bond yields over benchmark
Bunds had soared to a euro lifetime high on Wednesday, but a
well covered auction, albeit at a high yield, caused spreads to
tighten and the euro to rally to a session high. ""The auction
went reasonably well but with rising yields it's not that much
of a surprise. There are still worrying signs for Spain,
particularly stresses in the Spanish bank funding market,"" said
Lee Hardman, currency strategist at BTM-UFJ.
 At 0950GMT, the euro was trading up around 0.6 percent
versus the dollar at $1.2390, just off session highs. It had
fallen to a low of $1.2243 as worries over Spain's public
finances and banking sector hit sentiment in early trade.
 ""We think the euro rally is being driven by position
adjustment rather than fundamentals in particular,"" added
Hardman.
 Traders said stop-losses which had been placed above this
week's highs in the $1.2355/60 area had been targeted and
triggered in the wake of the Spanish auction results.
 The euro has now regained over 500 points from a four-year
low hit on June 7 at $1.1876, but still holds losses of over 13
percent year-to-date. 
 The European Union and International Monetary Fund denied on
Wednesday a report they and the U.S. Treasury were drawing up a
safety net for Spain. But worries about Spanish banks put
pressure on yields and the market will be looking for the
results of bank stress tests which the Spanish central bank said
would be published soon.
 The European Union holds a summit on Thursday to discuss
ways to strengthen budget discipline and economic policy
coordination.
 
 SWISS FRANC RISES
 The Swiss franc rose versus the euro and the dollar after
the SNB omitted specific reference to the currency in the
statement accompanying its decision to leave interest rates on
hold.
 The SNB said deflationary risks had all but disappeared,
implying its strict policy of currency intervention to prevent
excessive appreciation in the franc may no longer be required.
 ""The fact that the SNB have said deflationary risks have all
but disappeared for now is very bullish for the franc as
deflationary risks were associated with intervention risk,"" said
Audrey Childe-Freeman, senior currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman.
 The euro fell from around 1.3877 francs to a session low of
1.3759, bringing the recent all time low of 1.3731 into focus.
The dollar fell from around 1.1315 francs to a one-month low of
1.1128.
 The dollar traded with losses of around 0.5 percent versus a
currency basket as European stocks and US equity futures traded
in positive territory.

(Adds comments from media conference, rate futures)
 By Catherine Bosley and Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 17 (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank took a
step toward tightening its extraordinarily loose monetary policy
on Thursday, judging the Alpine economy's recovery is robust
enough to back off a pledge to fight a rise of the Swiss franc.
 The central bank held interest rates at ultra-low levels as
expected but dropped its promise to act decisively against an
excessive rise in the franc, sending its currency up over one
percent against the euro.
 SNB officials emphasised they would use all measures at
their disposal if the franc's rise risked leading to deflation
but they said that for now such risks had largely disappeared.
 The bank also raised its forecast for economic growth and
said inflation would breach the central banks' price stability
threshold of 2 percent in 2012, showing confidence the economy
would ride out any fallout from the euro zone's debt troubles.
 ""The key takeaway from the SNB is that it has dropped its
'excessive appreciation' remark concerning the franc,"" said ING
currency strategist Tom Levinson. ""That its statement also
refers to 'the weakening of the euro' is further evidence that
euro/Swiss franc is probably a one way bet lower.""
 Switzerland has recovered from recession less bruised than
many other countries in Europe over the past year, and the
detail of the bank's forecasts showed inflation should top 3
percent by the start of 2013.
 ""(The inflation forecast) also shows that the current
expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained over the
entire forecast horizon without compromising medium and
long-term price stability,"" SNB chairman Philipp Hildebrand told
a media conference in Geneva after the rate decision.
 ""Although the weakening of the euro with respect to the
Swiss franc is dampening export activity, this activity is being
supported by growth in foreign demand,"" Hildebrand said.
 ""In view of these pleasing developments, the deflationary
risk in Switzerland has largely disappeared.""
 When asked if the central bank had stopped interventions,
Hildebrand repeated that deflation risks had largely disappeared
and added: ""What is clear is that the Swiss National Bank will
not allow deflation risks to reappear in Switzerland and we will
take every measure necessary to ensure price stability.""
 The SNB raised its forecast for growth in 2010 to ""around
2.0 percent"" from about 1.5 percent previously. It saw inflation
this year rising to 0.9 percent from an earlier 0.7 percent and
in 2011 to 1.0 percent from 0.9 percent.
 
 HIKE EXPECTATIONS
 All 36 economists polled by Reuters had expected the SNB to
keep rates ultra-low, where they have been since March 2009, and
a large majority had also seen further currency interventions
given risks that the euro zone's problems would hamper
Switzerland's recovery
 Analysts were cautious as to what the change in rhetoric on
the franc meant for the timing of any rise in borrowing rates as
the SNB also highlighted the risks stemming from the debt crisis
in the euro zone.
 Most were already betting on a rise in interest rates in the
first quarter of 2011, although until Thursday's statement
interest rate futures had implied a slightly later move Futures
now price in an increase by March 2011.
 ""The SNB does not say whether it wants to obtain a
normalisation by means of a rate hike or through an appreciation
of the franc,"" said Unicredit analyst Alexander Koch.
 ""The SNB has left open when it will raise rates. It will
allow a controlled appreciation of the Swiss franc. That would
mean a sort of monetary tightening that has not been desired in
the past,"" he said.
 The debt crisis in the euro zone -- Switzerland's largest
trading partner -- has sent the franc to record highs against
the euro, tightening monetary conditions and creating a headache
for the country's key export industry.
 But separately on Thursday, data showed Swiss industrial
orders rose 13.1 percent in the first quarter.
 The tens of billions of francs pumped into markets via
interventions have flooded the market with cash, which has sent
the 3-month franc LIBOR to a record low.
 Board member Jean-Pierre Danthine said that the SNB would
now use its own debt -- so called SNB bills -- and reverse repo
to drain the excess liquidity.
 ""The SNB has been stepping up the issuance of SNB bills
since March 2010,"" Danthine said. The central bank has issued
bills ranging from one week to three months and announced a
6-month bill on Thursday.
 The SNB said that its target band for the 3-month Swiss
franc LIBOR will remain at 0.00-0.75 percent. It will continue
to aim to keep the LIBOR at 0.25 percent.

rate expectations and banks' appetite for lending -- rose to
0.729 percent from 0.727 percent the previous day, the highest
level since late October.
 Six-month rates  edged up to 1.011 percent from
1.008 percent, having broken through the ECB's benchmark
interest rate level of 1.0 percent last Thursday for the first
time since last November. 
 One-year rates  hit 1.281 percent, a nine-month
high, up from 1.278 percent, while shorter-term one-week rates
 bucked the trend, easing back to 0.364 percent
from 0.365 percent.
 The debt troubles hitting Greece and other financially
strained euro zone countries, have reignited fears about the
region's banks and forced the European Central Bank to
reintroduce extra lending operations and abandon a long-held
resistance to buying government bonds. [ID:nSGE65A02M]
 Markets are also bracing themselves for July 1, when banks
have to pay back 442 billion euros worth of one-year loans
borrowed from the ECB last year, although they will have the
option of switching to shorter-term loans.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2010 05:03AM ET</span>",Cameron positive at EU talks but defends red lines," * Cameron strikes positive note before first EU summit
 * Says Britain will be ""engaged, active"" in EU debate
 * Concerns remain over UK's marginalisation in EU affairs
 
 By Luke Baker
 BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - David Cameron was all smiles
when he began his first European Union summit as Britain's prime
minister on Thursday but was quick to say he would defend
national interests firmly.
 Cameron said he and European Commission President Jose
Manuel Barroso were closely aligned after they met for breakfast
talks shortly before the start of the summit on closer economic
cooperation and tighter budget rules. 
 ""What he (Barroso) has just said about the importance of
getting our public finances in order, that there can be no
growth without confidence, and that getting our public finances
in order is key to confidence, is absolutely right,"" he said.
 ""And I very much agree with what he has just said, that we
should be focusing on the issues of substance and not on
institutional reform. That was music to my ears.""
 But despite the display of unity, Britain could face a
battle to get its way on issues such as financial market reform,
on oversight of its budget and ensuring that the push for closer
economic cooperation does not involve the 16 euro zone countries
alone, but all 27 EU member states. 
 Cameron, whose Conservative party has had to temper some of
its traditional Euro-scepticism as part of a coalition
government with the more pro-European Liberal Democrats, said
Britain would be vigorous in defending its position in the EU.
 ""You'll see Britain playing a very positive, a very engaged,
a very active role in the European Union and at this (summit),""
he said.
 ""We of course always defend our national interests as others
do, and our national red lines. But we know how important it is
that there is in Europe growth and confidence, and that I think
is the most important issue on the agenda.""
 
 DEFENDING NATIONAL INTERESTS
 Some EU member states were concerned that Britain's new
government, formed after an election last month, would clash
with Europe as it sought to claw back powers seen to have been
lost to Brussels and took more rigid positions on new policy.
 But over the past month, the coalition government has
steered a central course, staying on good terms with Brussels
and even impressing some member states -- for example by sending
a fluent French- and German-speaking minister to meetings.
 The question is how long Cameron and his government can
maintain the balancing act, particularly when discussions over
policy and position intensify, and when the European Parliament
is involved in shaping laws on issues such as regulation. 
 Cameron upset some EU leaders last year by withdrawing his
party from the main centre-right group.
 ""There's a lot of relief that the new government is not as
Eurosceptic as people thought it would be,"" said Charles Grant,
the director of the Centre for European Reform think tank. 
 He said there was some regret that Britain was not more
closely involved in dealing with the euro zone debt crisis and
some other issues that are being debated. 
 ""Big questions of economic governance are being debated and
Britain is ... marginalised and not really involved,"" he said.
 Thursday's summit could go some way to showing how Britain
can manage to defend its interests and shape the EU debate. But
before the discussions began, Cameron mentioned some issues on
which Britain would not move.
 ""We're not a member of the euro, nor are we going to become
a member of the euro, but a strong, successful euro zone is
vital for Britain's national interests,"" he said.

(Edits, adds IMF, sources on stress tests)
 By Jan Strupczewski and Timothy Heritage
 BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - The European Union agreed
unexpectedly on Thursday to carry out more transparent checks of
its top banks' financial health as part of measures to convince
investors it can contain a euro zone debt crisis.
 EU leaders also agreed broad guidelines for tougher budget
rules and closer economic policy coordination at a one-day
summit, and said countries should face stronger sanctions if
they did not meet budget and debt targets.
 Budget plans must be submitted to the EU executive for peer
review before national parliaments, and the leaders said they
would propose a financial transaction tax to the Group of 20
developed and developing countries at a summit on June 26-27.
 Accord over more transparent ""stress tests"" for banks, to be
published in the second half of July, was not expected and
followed increasing pressure from financial markets for more
openness.
 ""Today the European Council (of EU leaders) has rolled up
its sleeves and shown we can act together when there is a joint
political will by member states and the European institutions,""
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
 The EU, which represents more than 500 million people,
agreed last month on a 500 billion euro ($617 billion) safety
net to help struggling countries that use the euro and a 110
billion euro aid mechanism for heavily indebted Greece.
 But it has struggled to allay concern that debt repayment
problems that began in Greece will not spread to other countries
in the 16-country euro zone, such as Spain.
 One leader after another rallied behind Madrid, praising
austerity plans it has announced to address its problems, and
markets were boosted by a successful bond auction in Spain.

 STRESS TESTS BANK-BY-BANK
 Madrid had called for more open stress tests, hoping this
would prove its banks' good health. Some countries, such as
Germany, have been reluctant to publish the results for
individual lenders that could lay bare unpleasant details.
 The stress tests gauge a bank's ability to withstand
economic shocks and are intended to help prevent any further
global economic crises.
 Bundesbank head Axel Weber said a new set of European bank
stress tests was needed to include a broader swath of the
banking industry and new scenarios such as the debt crisis.
 The International Monetary Fund also backed calls for better
information on European banks' exposure to sovereign debt, and
the United States has prompted Europe to be more open over the
results of its stress tests.
An EU diplomat, who asked not to be named, said: ""It will be
bank-by-bank for the 25 biggest banks.""
 The other unexpected measure agreed by the EU leaders was a
financial transaction tax. That had been discussed by Germany
but causes unease in some member states such as Britain, whose
capital, London, is Europe's largest financial centre.
 They also agreed on a growth and job creation strategy for
the next decade and on a European banking levy, even though
other world economies have avoided this. 
 The EU leaders say they will go it alone with the bank levy,
if necessary. It is intended to raise money to help battle
future crises from institutions widely blamed for the global
economic meltdown.
 
 TIGHTER ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
 The leaders did not set out to secure formal agreement on
how to deepen policy coordination, and the tougher budget rules
will not be set in stone until after a task force reports back
on reforms to defend the euro in October.
 They broadly concur on the need for closer policy
coordination, or ""economic government"", and for tighter
financial regulation, but do not agree how to go about it.
 Differences linger between German Chancellor Angela Merkel
and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, despite agreement on some
issues at talks on Monday.
 Britain is also hostile to parts of the drive towards closer
budget surveillance and says it will not allow its budget plans
to be submitted to the European Commission for review before the
national parliament.
 But EU diplomats said a phrase in a summit statement saying
such moves must take account of national budget procedures
addressed British concerns and did not cross what Prime Minister
David Cameron said were his ""red lines"".
 ""We of course always defend our national interests as others
do, and our national red lines, but we know how important it is
that there is in Europe growth and confidence and that, I think,
is the most important issue on the agenda,"" said Cameron,
attending his first EU summit.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a one-month
high on Thursday and the euro rose broadly after Spanish bond
issues drew strong demand, easing concerns over the country's
public finances.
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros of 10- and 30-year government
bonds, at the top of its target range, though yields were high.
The well covered auction helped narrow the spread of Spanish
yields over benchmark Bunds from an earlier euro lifetime high.
 France also sold just shy of 8 billion euros of short-dated
bonds.
 The relatively successful bond sales eased concerns over the
ability of peripheral euro zone countries, especially Spain, to
finance their huge debt amid investor nervousness that some of
the region's banks may be facing a liquidity freeze.
 ""The strong demand for Spanish bonds should help restore
confidence,"" said Ciaran O'Hagan, strategist at Societe
Generale.
The MSCI world equity index erased earlier losses to stand
up 0.26 percent, hitting a one-month high.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.6 percent.
 Oil major BP surged more than 7 percent after saying it will
set up a $20 billion fund for damages claims from its huge Gulf
of Mexico oil spill, sell assets and suspend dividend payments
to shareholders.
 European bank shares also rose broadly.
 UK finance minister George Osborne announced the biggest
shake-up of the regulatory landscape in 13 years on Wednesday,
saying he was to give the Bank of England ultimate control over
financial supervision.
 ""We have seen some resolution from the European politicians.
Even though the problems are not going away they are conveying
the impression that they are going to do something about it,""
said David Buik, senior partner at BGC partners.
 ""When the markets have been out of confidence that is what
they want to see.""
 Emerging stocks were up 0.6 percent.
 The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.2375 while the dollar erased
gains to stand down 0.4 percent.
 European Union leaders began talks on Thursday on ways to
strengthen budget discipline and economic policy coordination,
hoping to show financial markets they can see off a euro zone
debt crisis.
 Spain's economy minister Elena Salgado said the country will
publish detailed results of bank stress test and may use as much
as 30 billion euros of its Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring
(FROB) to cover its lenders' financing needs.
 Bund futures fell 19 ticks as improving sentiment for
peripheral bond cut demand for safe-haven German bonds. 
 U.S. crude oil fell 0.4 percent to $77.34 a barrel.

game
 * Says G20 is not the right place to discuss the yuan
 * Says China's shift to domestic consumption will take

(Adds quotes by foreign ministry spokesman)
 By Benjamin Kang Lim and Ben Blanchard
 BEIJING, June 17 (Reuters) - Finger-pointing at the G20
will be self-defeating for an international forum that should
be focused on coordination, not criticism, of economic
policies, a senior Chinese government official said.
 Underlining the extent to which China wants to shield its
currency policy from censure, a second official said that the
Group of 20 summit in Canada on June 26-27 was not the right
place for discussing ""the yuan issue"".
 The comments appeared to be an attempt to draw a line in
the sand about what should be discussed at the summit of
wealthy and emerging economies, cast as a warning that
controversy could hinder the global recovery by rattling market
confidence.
 Financial markets are watching the G20, which Chinese
President Hu Jintao will attend, for any statements about
China's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar after the
United States stepped up its criticism in recent days.
 ""If we allow the G20 to turn into a process of
finger-pointing, then it will certainly send out a very
confusing and misleading signal to the markets and to the
general public,"" said a senior official, who spoke to reporters
on the condition of anonymity.
 ""This will certainly lead to very serious consequences in
the global economy. I do not think that would be the purpose of
the G20 process, and that would be self-defeating for the
group,"" he said.
 Qin Gang, a foreign ministry spokesman, was more explicit.
 ""At the G20, in my view, it is inappropriate to discuss the
yuan issue,"" he told a regular news briefing.
 ""The yuan exchange rate issue was not a cause of the
international financial crisis, and it is not a hurdle for
world economic recovery, rebalancing or sustainable growth"".
 Complaints about the yuan have eased over the last two
months as the euro zone debt crisis has taken centre stage. But
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said last week that
the yuan was an impediment to global rebalancing, suggesting
that U.S. patience with China's currency policy was wearing
thin.
 Many lawmakers in the U.S. Congress contend the yuan is
grossly undervalued, unfarily squeezing out competition against
cheaper Chinese goods.
 A senior Canadian official said this week that the G20 must
be careful not to exert too much direct pressure on China,
while still delivering the message that a stronger yuan would
be in Beijing's own interest. [ID:nN16139399]
 REBALANCING
 With China's trade surplus having surged in May, attention
is shifting back to how much its growth model -- marked by weak
consumption and strong exports -- is to blame for global
imbalances that were a root cause of the 2008 financial crisis.
 Chinese leaders have long insisted -- and many economists
agree -- that a set of policies broader than just its exchange
rate regime is needed to overhaul the economy.
 The senior Chinese official said change would not happen
overnight.
 ""We are also trying to pursue economic restructuring and to
transform our pattern for economic development. That is exactly
what we are doing, but it will take some time,"" he said.
 It was unreasonable to expect the Chinese people to
immediately fill the void left by U.S. consumers who are
spending less money in the wake of the global financial crisis,
he said.
 ""Construction workers in Beijing or Shanghai, if their
income increases, may be ready and happy to buy more home
appliances and new bicycles, but you cannot expect them to buy
a new Mercedes overnight,"" he said.
 ""Chinese workers might lose their jobs in the textile
industry, in the toy industry, in the shoe industry because of
lack of demand from overseas markets, but you cannot turn them
into investment bankers overnight,"" he added.
 STAGGERED EXITS
 On the question of coordinating the withdrawal of
anti-crisis stimulus programmes, the Chinese official said it
would be a delicate balance at the G20 summit to demonstrate
that governments would still remain supportive of markets.
 ""We have to be careful not to give people the impression
that the entire group is starting the so-called exit strategy
at the same time,"" he said.
 ""We have to make sure that while some of the members are
trying very hard to reduce their budget deficits to improve
their macroeconomic and financial and budgetary balances, we
are still firmly committed toward economic recovery.""
 He also said that China would look to the G20 summit in
Toronto to push forward prior agreements to increase the
representation of developing countries at the International
Monetary Fund.
 A review of the IMF's power structure will likely increase
the votes of big emerging economies, especially China, before a
January 2011 deadline.

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro slipped against the
dollar on Thursday as worries about Spain's public finances and
banking system hit sentiment, with results of a Spanish bond
auction awaited.
 The market will be watching the auction of up to 3.5 billion
euros of 10- and 30-year bonds later in the day after the spread
of Spanish government bond yields over benchmark Bunds soared to
a euro lifetime high on Wednesday.
 ""A failure to cover these auctions could see some of the
risk appetite that has returned this week dissipate very
quickly,"" said Michael Hewson, currency analyst at CMC Markets.
 The European Union and International Monetary Fund denied
on Wednesday a report they and the U.S. Treasury were drawing up
a safety net for Spain. But worries about Spanish banks put
pressure on yields and the market will be looking for the
results of bank stress tests which the Spanish central bank said
would be published soon.
 The European Union holds a summit on Thursday to discuss
ways to strengthen budget discipline and economic policy
coordination. 
 At 0655 GMT, the euro was trading down 0.4 percent versus
the dollar at $1.2262, having risen to a two-week high on
Wednesday on increased risk tolerance and, in particular, demand
from sovereign accounts.
 ""Despite the relentless demand the market has seen from some
quarters, the euro outlook is bleak as the market continues to
focus on Spain,"" a spot trader at a U.S. bank in London said.
 Traders said there was good demand in the $1.2250 area with
stop-losses lurking below, while technical analysts noted
support at $1.2175, the 38.2 percent retracement of the rebound
from a four-year low below $1.19 set last week.
 The euro also fell 0.5 percent to 111.95 yen, while the
dollar was down 0.1 percent at 91.30 yen.
 The dollar index was up 0.4 percent at 86.404, well above
support near 85.85 which is the index's May 28 low.
 The dollar was little changed on the day against the Swiss
franc at 1.1307 francs ahead of a Swiss National Bank policy
meeting.
 The SNB is expected to keep interest rates low but may
announce measures to drain excess money from the economy after
flooding the market with francs since 2009 to keep the currency
from appreciating too rapidly.

 * Executive says expects ""very strong"" Q3 demand

 By Peter Levring and John Acher
 COPENHAGEN, June 17 (Reuters) - Maersk Line, the world's
biggest container shipping group, said on Thursday a strong
rebound in global trade has led to an unprecedented shortage of
containers as shipping enters its peak season.
 Maersk Line, part of Danish oil and shipping group A.P.
Moller-Maersk, is sometimes seen as a barometer of world trade.
Last week it announced unusually high peak season surcharges on
freight rates from Asia to Europe.
 ""The present market situation is unique,"" Lars Reno
Jakobsen, head of Network and Product and a member of Maersk
Line's management board, said in a statement.
 Jakobsen told Reuters that Maersk expects the seasonal
third-quarter demand increase to be ""very strong"" this year.
 He said that demand for shipping from Asia remained high
after the Chinese New Year instead of the usual slackening.
 ""The (vessel) utilisation rates have been much higher in the
second quarter than they have normally been,"" he said. ""It is a
very exceptional year ... That means there's a shortage of space
on the vessels and for containers for the period.""
 ""We are experiencing a demand surge in most trades, which is
a development that is both unprecedented and unexpected by us
and our customers,"" Jakobsen said in the statement.
 Asia-Europe trade is growing by 23 percent year-on-year,
outpacing the market's 3-6 percent forecast from six months ago,
he said.
 ""We expect an even more pronounced and serious shortage of
containers in the coming months as we enter the peak season,"" he
added.
 After a plunge in the market from late 2008 through last
year, the global shipping industry is recovering with world
trade.
 
 CONTAINER SCARCITY
 ""Maersk Line expects the equipment (container) shortage to
last through the third quarter of this year and will continue to
work closely together with all stakeholders, not least our
customers, to further reduce equipment turnaround times,"" it
said.
 Jakobsen told Reuters that Maersk Line had obtained 50,000
extra 40-foot units to help overcome the shortage -- adding to
its existing 1.3 million units.
 During the slump of 2008-2009, many container shipping and
container leasing companies stopped sourcing and producing
containers, Maersk said.
 ""As carriers and shippers did not expect the current demand
surge, the necessary equipment has not been ordered in 2010,
ultimately resulting in the global shortage in equipment,"" it
said.
 In response to the equipment shortage, Maersk Line has begun
producing new containers and leasing containers, it said.
 It has also re-activated laid-up vessels to help reposition
containers as fast as possible from, for instance, the east
coast of North America and Latin America to Asia, it said.
 Jakobsen said all major vessels were employed, and only
minor tonnage was still laid up.
 Last week, Maersk Line announced a peak season surcharge
(PSS) for the Far East-Europe trade applicable from July 2010,
Maersk said. 
 The surcharge will help Maersk recover the higher costs
caused by the increased volumes and equipment shortages, such as
port costs and costs of extraordinary vessels deployed to
reposition containers, Maersk said.
 Maersk said it would apply only one peak season surcharge so
it would not announce separate surcharges or rate increases in
connection with the peak season.

 In response to the equipment shortage, Maersk Line has
begun producing new containers and leasing containers, it said.
 It has also re-activated laid-up vessels to help reposition
containers as fast as possible from, for instance, the east
coast of North America and Latin America to Asia, it said.
 Last week, Maersk Line announced a peak season surcharge
(PSS) for the Far East-Europe trade applicable from July 2010,
Maersk said.
 The surcharge will help Maersk recover the higher costs
caused by the increased volumes and equipment shortages, such
as port costs and costs of extraordinary vessels deployed to
reposition containers, Maersk said.
 Maersk said it would apply only one peak season surcharge
so it would not announce separate surcharges or rate increases
in connection with the peak season.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2010 02:03AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Hungary govt eyes new IMF/EU deal - PM aide," * Hungary's current IMF/EU deal expires in October
 * Govt may extend deal until Dec, have new deal for 2011
(Adds more comments, details)
 BUDAPEST, June 17 (Reuters) - Hungary's new government will
start negotiations in July with the International Monetary Fund
and EU about a new loan agreement, a chief aide to the prime
minister told television M1 on Thursday.
 Hungary secured a $25.1 billion financing deal with the
IMF, the European Union and the World Bank in October 2008 to
avert a meltdown amid a market crisis. The agreement will
expire in October.
 When asked if there would be a new agreement with lenders,
Gyprgy Szapary, chief aide to Prime Minister Viktor Orban,
said:
 ""I hope there will be (an agreement)...The delegations (of
IMF and EU) will come here in early July; we will sit down to
negotiate then so that there can be a new agreement.""
 ""We are thinking about possibly extending (the current aid
deal) until December so that there is no break in the
programme, because we think that potentially we could get
another agreement for 2011,"" Szapary added.
 He said Hungary did not plan to draw down the currently
available tranches of the existing loan for now, but said the
funds may have to be used if the global sentiment turns
unfavourable.
 ""For the time being the decision is that we will not drawn
down the remaining amount...but there may be a scenario later
under which these funds need to be used as something may happen
in the global economy which could force Hungary to draw down
the remaining part of the loan,"" Szapary said.
 The state has so far drawn about 12.8 billion euros from
the credit facility secured in 2008, but some of these funds
have not been spent. The central bank has called down 1.4
billion euros from the package, placing it in its reserves.
 Hungary still has access to a further financing of about 5
billion euros from the original facility, pending agreement
with lenders at the next loan programme review.
 The country has not drawn fresh funds from the IMF/EU this
year as last year it successfully returned to market financing
after the previous Socialist government stabilised finances
with spending cuts and regained investors' confidence.
 Hungary, which has a new centre-right government since
April elections, had a budget deficit of 4 percent of gross
domestic product last year and targets a 3.8 percent deficit in
2010.
 The country's public debt at around 80 percent of GDP is
still the highest in central Europe.
 Earlier this month, highly confusing comments from some
Hungarian government officials drawing comparisons between
Hungary and debt-laden Greece triggered a selloff in the forint
currency  and global financial markets.
 The government announced a quick set of measures and
pledged to meet the deficit target which has calmed markets,
but analysts warned that implementation risks remain,
especially linked to a planned big new tariff on the financial
sector.

 * Spanish bond auctions seen as litmus test for euro
 * High-yielders off peaks, could see further pullback
 By Hideyuki Sano
 TOKYO, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro slipped from its two-week
highs versus the dollar on Thursday as its short-covering rally
ran out of steam and as worries about Spain's public finances and
banking system stopped it overcoming key resistance.
 After failing to break above $1.2350-55 twice in the past 48
hours, the euro is at risk of retreat to around $1.2175, a 38.2
percent retracement of its rebound from a four-year low below
$1.19 set last week.
 Traders said the rally now looked tired and the euro was
likely to see selling into rallies as tolerance for risk subsided
on a revival in concerns about euro zone fiscal problems.
 ""Some people want to reduce risk positions on worries about
Spain,"" said Daisuke Karakama, market economist at Mizuho
Corporate Bank.
 But the euro's fall has not been as sharp as in May when
worries about the impact of Europe's fiscal problems drove it
down rapidly, and this indicated that although some shorts have
been covered, the market is still short euro longer term,
Karakama said.
 ""The euro would have been sold much more hysterically if it
were a month ago,"" he said.
 It slipped 0.3 percent from late U.S. levels to $1.2270. It
is more than half a percent below the two-week high of $1.2354
hit on Wednesday but still up about 3 percent from the four-year
low of $1.1876.
 The market will be watching a Spanish bond auction later in
the day after the spread of Spanish government bond yields over
benchmark Bunds soared to a euro lifetime high on Wednesday.
 ""In the past few sessions, rises in the credit spreads of
euro zone countries have not led to euro selling as much as
before. But unless conditions in Europe improve, correlation
(between the euro and European bond spreads) will return,"" said
Junya Tanase, senior strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank.
 The European Union holds a summit on Thursday to discuss ways
to strengthen budget discipline and economic policy coordination.
 The EU and IMF on Wednesday denied a report they and the U.S.
Treasury were drawing up a safety net for Spain. But worries
about Spanish banks put pressure on yields and the market will be
looking for the result of bank stress tests which the Spanish
central bank said would be published soon.
 The euro also fell against sterling, the yen and the Swiss
franc. It shed 0.7 percent to 112.00 yen as Japanese banks sold.
That helped push the dollar down 0.5 percent to 91.30 yen.
 The dollar index was up 0.3 percent at 86.32, well above
support near 85.85 which is the index's May 28 low.
 The Australian dollar eased from one-month highs of $0.8674.
It was trading at $0.8596, down 0.3 percent, with some players
looking to sell into rallies after it failed to hold gains above
$0.8650.
 The dollar was marginally higher against the Swiss franc at
1.1303 francs ahead of a Swiss National Bank meeting.
 The SNB is expected to keep interest rates low but may
announce measures to drain excess money from the economy after
flooding the market with francs since 2009 to keep the currency
from appreciating too rapidly.

 SINGAPORE, June 17 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell and the
euro slipped on Thursday as short covering rallies ran out of
steam, but some analysts said global markets may have finally
found support after a heavy selloff in May.
 European shares were expected to eke out small gains, with
financial spreadbetters calling London's FTSE 100 to open up
0.2 percent.
 But concerns about the euro zone's fiscal frailty lingered.
 ""We're much happier over here in Asia, but we don't live in
our own world,"" said Nicholas Yeo, head of China/HK equities at
Aberdeen Asset Management. ""What happens in the West will
affect Asia.""
 Oil, which has been tracking moves in the euro and stock
markets, fell back from a six-week high, while gold, which
tends to gain from falling share markets due to its safe haven
appeal, firmed to near its highest in a week.
 ""Players think the euro's rise, led by short-covering, has
come to a near-term end,"" said an FX trader at a major Japanese
brokerage.
 Japan's Nikkei share average fell 0.7 percent, after five
days of gains had brought it to one-month highs, while MSCI's
index of Asian shares outside Japan eased 0.1 percent.
 ""There seems to be a double bottom forming in a number of
global stock markets,"" said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at
the equity division of Nikko Cordial Securities in Tokyo.
 Such a technical pattern on price charts could indicate
that stocks are poised to move higher, but investors remain
wary after a nerve-wracking slump in global financial markets
since mid April.
 U.S. stocks ended flat on Tuesday after mixed economic data
and a cautious outlook from bellwether FedEx Corp
 But the S&P 500 held above its 200-day moving average, seen
by many market players as a key momentum indicator, a day after
breaking above that mark for the first time in a month.
 World stock markets had been gaining for the best part of a
week, partly on a technical rebound from heavily oversold
levels and partly as many investors took a relatively positive
view of the global economy -- and hence corporate earnings
prospects -- with the risk of a ""double dip"" recession seen as
easing.
 A Reuters poll published on Wednesday showed a continuing
divergence in the expected rate of recovery among the world's
richest nations, with Europe's debt crisis continuing to hamper
economies across the continent.
 The growth path for 2010 in the United States, the world's
largest economy, has been revised higher, running away from the
euro zone and Britain and also outstripping Japan, according to
surveys of over 250 economists taken June 10-16.
 A separate Reuters sentiment survey on Thursday showed
Asia's top companies at their most optimistic in five quarters,
as robust economic growth in the region outweighs concerns
about debt problems in Europe and the recent surge in market
volatility.
 EURO STUMBLES
 A bigger-than-expected fall in U.S. housing starts among
Wednesday's data pared gains in high yielding currencies such
as the Australian dollar which eased from a 1-month high.
 The euro fell back from a two-week high to trade around
$1.2275.
 After failing to break above $1.2350-55 twice in the past
48 hours, the euro is at risk of retreat to around $1.2175, a
38.2 percent retracement of its rebound from a four-year low

 EU leaders will meet on Thursday to review the findings of
a task force set up to look at reforms designed to prevent a
repeat of the euro zone debt crisis. They will also discuss the
creation of a permanent aid mechanism for countries in debt
trouble.
 The leaders have agreed on a 500 million-euro ($617.2
million) safety net to help struggling countries that use the
euro and a 110-billion-euro aid mechanism for Greece. But
despite repeated denials, they have not allayed concern that
Spain will follow Greece by seeking financial help.
 European Central Bank executive board member Joseph Manuel
Gonzalez-Paramo said in an interview published in a German
paper on Thursday that the central bank would continue buying
government bonds until markets have stabilised.
 U.S. crude futures fell 0.9 percent to $76.95 a barrel as
investors took profits from oil's recent rally.
 Oil has rebounded from a 2010 low of $64.24 on May 20.
Sentiment improved further after the S&P 500 rose above its
200-day moving average on Tuesday, helping push NYMEX crude
above its own 200-day moving average.

 By Timothy Heritage
 BRUSSELS, June 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders hope to
agree on ways to strengthen budget discipline and economic
policy coordination on Thursday to show financial markets they
can prevent a repeat of the euro zone debt crisis.
 Leaders of the 27 member states and the executive European
Commission will also work on tightening financial regulation to
help prevent another global economic crisis, including a levy to
ensure banks pay for any future crises. [ID:nLDE65F24E]
 The leaders have agreed on a 500-billion-euro ($617.2-
billion) safety net to help struggling countries that use the
euro and a 110-billion-euro aid mechanism for Greece.
 But despite repeated denials, they have not allayed concern
that Spain will follow Greece by seeking financial help.
 ""The turmoil in the sovereign debt markets has cast a
serious shadow over financial stability in Europe, which could
... derail the still nascent recovery of the real economy,"" EU
Monetary Affairs Commission Olli Rehn warned on Wednesday.
 A show of unity is likely at the one day-summit, which will
review the findings of a task force set up to look at reforms
designed to prevent debt building up, increase cooperation and
set up a permanent aid mechanism for countries in debt trouble.
 Failure to show solidarity could increase the market
nervousness that has helped drive down the euro and shares.
 The leaders broadly agree on the need for closer economic
policy coordination, or ""economic government"", and on the need
for tighter financial regulation, but do not all see eye to eye
on how to go about it.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy set the tone on Monday by pledging unity to defend the
euro from its worst crisis since it was founded 11 years ago.
 Sarkozy bowed to German demands for tougher budget rules and
accepted euro zone states which persistently breach deficit
limits should have their voting rights in the bloc suspended,
even if it requires treaty changes.
 He also accepted closer ""economic government"", or greater
economic policy coordination, should involve all 27 EU member
states and not just the 16 that use the euro, and dropped
demands for dedicated euro zone secretariat.
 ""More than ever, Germany and France are determined to talk
with one voice, to adopt common policies, to give Europe the
means to met its legitimate ambitions,"" Sarkozy said.
 
 MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB
 But EU diplomats say differences remain and there is a long
way to go to convince the markets and get through the crisis.
 Britain, for example, is hostile to important parts of the
drive towards closer budget surveillance and says it will not
allow its budget plans to be submitted to the Commission for
review before the national parliament.
 British Prime Minister David Cameron is likely to defend his
position strongly at his first EU summit. [ID:nLDE65F1JD]
 Swedish Prime Minster Fredrik Reinfeldt ruled out any
changes of the EU treaty to strengthen budget discipline on
Wednesday, opposing calls for amendments led by Germany to step
up sanctions on budget sinners. [ID:nLDE65F2CC]
 ""My mood is still bleak. We are not over the hill on this,
we are still climbing up it,"" a senior EU envoy said.
 A decision by Moody's rating agency to cut Greece's debt to
non-investment grade on Monday served notice of the need for the
EU to remain alert over the debt crisis.
 Spain, which has a closely watched bond auction on Thursday,
also is a cause for concern although member states say it is not
on the agenda of the summit and have denied repeatedly that
Madrid is seeking financial help. [ID:nLDE65F24E]
 Madrid won plaudits from Merkel on Wednesday for announcing
labour reforms to try to boost its competitiveness. But
financial analysts questioned whether its plans, or pension
reforms announced by France the same day, go far enough.
 The leaders are expected to press ahead with moves towards
Europe's own banking levy after the world's top economies failed
to agree on such a tax for an industry widely seen as one of the
main culprits behind the global economic meltdown.
 They aim to agree a joint position for the G20 summit in
Toronto on June 26-27.
 Pressure also is mounting for European regulators to publish
results of stress tests on individual banks to restore market
confidence and overcome a partial freeze in inter-bank lending.
Such tests show banks' ability to withstand liquidity problems.
 Finland's finance minister said on Wednesday that support
for more transparent bank stress tests was growing in Europe,
but it was not clear whether such moves would be on the agenda.

 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 17 (Reuters) - The euro consolidated below
two-week highs on Thursday, with most investors on the sidelines
ahead of a raft of bond auctions in the euro zone area as
concerns about Spain's banking system weigh down on sentiment.
 Traders said a plunge in U.S. housing starts led
high-yielders to pare gains, especially the Australian dollar
, which was toppled from one-month highs.
 In Asia, investors will see how the Shanghai stock market
<.SSEC> performs after it reopens from holidays later on
Thursday. Traders say if it fails to catch up with some of the
impressive gains seen on Wall Street, the euro and growth-linked
currencies could come under pressure.
 In Asian trade, the euro  was broadly steady at
$1.2310, but off a two-week high of $1.2354 on Wednesday. Near
term resistance for the euro is still seen at this month's high
of $1.2355.
 Though the single currency is up 1.6 percent this week, the
fact that it has failed to break convincingly through the $1.2350
area could lead to a pull back in the near term, traders said.
 Still, many investors will adopt a wait-and-watch stance
ahead of a raft of European bond auctions, notably from Spain who
will sell 2020 and 2041 bonds on Thursday [ID:nLDE65F1X2].
 This could be a litmus test for the euro after spreads of
some of the peripherial economies widened over German Bunds,
traders said.
 ""With a hectic period ahead for redemptions and the near-term
event risk of the Spanish auctions on Thursday, we remain
reluctant to view this as a trend reversal in the fortunes of the
euro,"" JP Morgan said in a morning note.
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.12 percent at 112.52 yen
 while the dollar was flat at 91.40 yen .
 The dollar was marginally higher against the Swiss franc
 at 1.1304 francs, ahead of Thursday's Swiss National Bank
meeting.
 The SNB is expected to keep interest rates low but may
announce measures to drain excess money from the economy after
having flooded the market with francs since 2009 to keep the
currency from appreciating too rapidly. [ID:nLDE65E2DB]
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> was up at 86.17, hovering well
above support near the 85.85 area which is the index's May 28
low.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar  eased from
one-month highs of $0.8674. It was trading at $0.8624 in Asian
trade with some looking to sell into rallies, given it has failed
to break resistance convincingly.

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed flat on
Wednesday, battered by weak housing data that underscored an
uneven recovery, while the euro slipped against the dollar on
renewed concerns about Spain's credit and banking system.
 U.S. housing starts in May fell to a five-month low,
raising risk aversion among investors, even though
stronger-than-expected U.S. industrial production helped keep
stock and currency losses in check.
 U.S. government debt prices rose on the housing data, which
added to fears the U.S. economic recovery remains tentative.
Industrial metal prices mostly fell, with U.S. copper futures
snapping a six-day rally.
 U.S. stocks initially traded down, then rebounded on news
that BP had reached a tentative agreement to open an escrow
fund demanded by U.S. President Barack Obama to provide for
claims from its Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
 BP's New York-traded shares rose 1.5 percent, although they
have shed almost half their market value since the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill occurred in April.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> added 4.69 points,
or 0.05 percent, to 10,409.46. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
<.SPX> edged down just 0.62 of a point, or 0.06 percent, to

 ""The industrial production number is saying that demand is
still there, production is still there,"" said Marc Pado, U.S.
market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in San Francisco.
""That's telling me there is going to be a nice little increase

 TORONTO, June 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar fell from
a one-month high against the U.S. currency on Wednesday to
close slightly lower as stock markets and investor appetite for
risk lost steam late in the session.
 The Canadian dollar earlier touched C$1.0224 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.81 U.S. cents, its best level since May 14,
strongly supported by higher oil prices. [O/R]
 But choppiness in equity markets, which saw Toronto's
resource-heavy index barely close with gains, helped drag the
currency lower. [.TO] [.N]
 ""Stocks were in positive territory for a while and they
just eased off. That's put a little bit of pressure on Canada,""
said Steve Butler, director of foreign exchange trading at
Scotia Capital.
 The market largely shrugged off comments by Bank of Canada
Governor Mark Carney in a speech and press conference in Prince
Edward Island.
 The head of the central bank cautioned markets not to take
another interest rate hike for granted, saying volatile global
conditions mean no particular path for monetary policy is
preordained. [ID:nN16164000]
 ""I don't know if he gave us anything that could cement a
view one way or the other,"" said Butler, but added: ""I do think
we will see another rate hike in July.""
 The central bank raised its key rate by a quarter point on
June 1 to 0.5 percent, becoming the first central bank in the
Group of Seven wealthy countries to do so. Markets are pricing
in a second rate hike on July 20. [BOCWATCH]
 The Canadian currency finished at C$1.0254 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.52 U.S. cents, down slightly from C$1.0251, or
97.55 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close.
 Earlier, the currency got much of its lift from a move in
the oil price to above $77 a barrel, said Matthew Strauss,
senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The rise was
also facilitated by the currency's ability to punch through key
technical levels.
 Carney's speech offered ""nothing really new or no new
insight into monetary policy thinking from the Bank of Canada
perspective,"" Strauss said, adding it ""provided no direction""
for the Canadian dollar.
 Strauss said the next key technical levels for the currency
are C$1.0225 to the U.S. dollar and C$1.0111. On the top side,
analysts would be eyeing C$1.0328.
 BONDS HIGHER; CANADA HOLDS 'GOOD AUCTION'
 Canadian bond prices rose across the curve, tracking U.S.
Treasury issues, which benefited from a report showing U.S.
housing starts in May fell more than expected to a five-month
low. [US/]
 The two-year government bond  rose 9.5 Canadian
cents to yield 1.777 percent, while the 10-year bond
 rose 55 Canadian cents to yield 3.363 percent.
 Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. treasuries. The Canadian
10-year bond yield was 9.7 basis points above its U.S.
counterpart, compared with 12 basis points on Tuesday.
 The Bank of Canada said on Wednesday its C$3 billion
auction of 2.5 percent Government of Canada bonds due Sept. 1,
2013 produced an average yield of 2.393 percent. [CA/AUC]
 Bids from primary dealers totaled C$7.296 billion,
resulting in a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.43. The ratio is a
measure of investor demand and a reading above 2 generally
indicates a solid auction.
 ""(There was) fairly decent demand. It was a good auction,""
said Sheldon Dong, fixed income analyst at TD Waterhouse
Private Investment.
 ""The global financial markets are still pretty much
unsettled so there is still a flight to quality. So short-term
debt is a good way to park your money.""

 SELL EURO ON RALLIES
 After hitting $1.1876 last week, its lowest level since
2006, the euro has risen more than 3 percent against the

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2010 01:39PM ET</span>",ANALYSIS-British coalition's EU honeymoon may not last," * New government fails to live up to Eurosceptic image
 * Battles may lie ahead with Brussels and inside coalition
 
 By Adrian Croft
 LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - Fears Britain's new government
would clash with Europe have so far proved unfounded but Prime
Minister David Cameron faces a tricky balancing act to stay on
good terms with Brussels while holding his coalition together.
 Cameron heads to Brussels for his first European Union
summit on Thursday hoping to cement the relatively favourable
impression he has made in Europe since he took power at the head
of a coalition government after Britain's May 6 election.
 He has been to Paris and Berlin, EU power centres, and he
will see French President Nicolas Sarkozy again on Friday when
he visits London to commemorate Charles de Gaulle's 1940 appeal
to the French to resist German occupation.
 Cameron's Eurosceptic centre-right Conservative Party fell
short of an overall majority in the vote and had to build a
coalition with pro-European, centre-left Liberal Democrats.
 As a result, the Conservatives were forced to drop some
policies on Europe that they had campaigned on, including a
pledge to claw back some powers from Brussels.
 The coalition says any future transfer of power to Brussels
should be subject to a British referendum.
 The government has shown it is keen to engage with Britain's
European partners, sending polyglot Deputy Prime Minister Nick
Clegg, Lib Dem leader and former European Parliament member with
a Spanish wife, to visit Berlin and Madrid.
 ""The government has ended up being what British governments
tend to be, which is pragmatic and businesslike on the
day-to-day agenda issues that the EU faces,"" Richard Whitman,
politics professor at the University of Bath, told Reuters.
 ""Despite the change of government it has been really
business as usual,"" he said.
 Cameron's government is preoccupied with how to cut a budget
deficit of a similar scale to that of Greece and does not want
to pick fights with Europe, analysts say.
 
 STANDING ALOOF
 Non-euro zone Britain is largely standing aloof from the
euro zone financial crisis while insisting it wants a healthy
euro zone, a key trading partner.
 Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform
thinktank, said the coalition had made a good start.
 ""There's a lot of relief that the new government is not as
Eurosceptic as people thought it would be,"" he said.
 But there was also regret in Europe that Britain was not
more active in tackling the euro zone crisis, he said.
 ""Big questions of economic governance are being debated and
Britain is ... marginalised and not really involved,"" he said.
 Emma Bonino, a centre-left Italian politician and former
European Commissioner, told Reuters on the sidelines of a
seminar in London on Tuesday that it was too early for many
European capitals to have assessed the new British government.
 The coalition had not been particularly negative, or
particularly assertive, so far, she said.
 Some doubt whether the relative calm in Britain's relations
with Europe and within the coalition will last.
 
 RUMBLINGS OF DISCONTENT
 There are rumblings of discontent among Eurosceptic
Conservative members of parliament upset that election
commitments, including a pledge to enshrine ultimate authority
in the British parliament by law, have been watered down.
 Fights could lay ahead in which Cameron may have to choose
between staying on good terms with the rest of Europe and
provoking a revolt among Eurosceptic MPs similar to those which
dogged the last Conservative government in the early 1990s.
 If a touchstone issue arose that affected British
sovereignty at a time of wider discontent within the coalition,
it could become a ""lightning conductor"" for dissent among
rank-and-file members of parliament, Whitman said.
 One such area could be negotiations on the EU budget for
2014-21 expected to start this year in which the British are
likely to seek a radical overhaul of the bloc's finances.
 The new government is a strong supporter of EU enlargement
and backs greater EU cooperation on foreign policy issues such
as the Iranian nuclear question.
 Cameron's government has had to negotiate a lively first
month of European diplomacy as Greece and other euro zone
countries wrestle with a financial crisis.
 Under a decision taken in the final days of the former
Labour government, Britain played only a small role in a $1
trillion deal to bail out vulnerable euro zone economies.
 Within days of taking office, new finance minister George
Osborne was forced to accept defeat when EU finance ministers
backed stricter controls for hedge funds that Britain had fought
hard to water down.
 Cameron showed his mettle after talks with German Chancellor
Angela Merkel in Berlin last month when he made clear Britain
would block Merkel's call for EU treaty changes in response to
the Greek crisis.
 A further flashpoint has emerged with the British government
strongly opposing proposals for EU member states to give the
Commission an early sight of their budget plans. Cameron's
government says the budget must be presented to the British
parliament first.
 However, analysts say a compromise should be possible, as
Britain publishes a pre-budget report well before the start of
the fiscal year, setting out the framework and assumptions
behind the budget, which could be submitted to Brussels.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2010 01:31PM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-EU lawmakers demand stricter food-labelling rules," * EU parliament boosts draft rules aimed at fighting obesity
 * Meat, fish products must show country of origin, MEPs say
 * Parliament rejects ""traffic light"" labelling schemes
 
 (Adds reaction)
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers voted
on Wednesday to strengthen controversial draft rules on food
labelling that aim to fight rising levels of obesity in Europe.
 The European Parliament backed a proposed requirement for
companies to label the energy, sugar, salt and fat content of
their foodstuffs on the front of packages, and added protein,
unsaturated fats and fibre to this list.
 Voting in Strasbourg, France, MEPs also added a requirement
for country-of-origin labels on meat, dairy, and fruit and
vegetables, as well as meat and fish products used in processed
food -- a move that opponents called ""protectionist"".
 But it was unclear whether the country-of-origin requirement
would need a positive EU impact assessment before adoption, with
MEPs and industry saying after the complex vote that they were
still trying to work out exactly what had been agreed.
 After much industry lobbying, MEPs rejected mandatory
""traffic light"" labels on certain convenience foods and soft
drinks, with red, amber or green colour codes showing the
relative amounts of salt, sugar and fat they contain.
 Consumer groups accused MEPs of ignoring the needs of
consumers and caving into food industry pressure.
 ""Literally hundreds of lobbyists in Strasbourg this week
were trying to persuade MEPs, which they obviously did, very
successfully,"" Dave McCullough of European Consumers'
Organisation BEUC told Reuters Television.
 The Corporate Europe Observatory campaign group said the
food and drink industry had spent over 1 billion euros ($1.23
billion) opposing the traffic light system, which consumer
organisations argue is easier to understand.
 But in a statement the EU food and drink industry
confederation, CIAA, said the traffic light system ""failed to
take into account the place of a foodstuff in the context of a
balanced and healthy lifestyle.""
 ""Democratically-elected Members of the European Parliament
have had their say on the Commission's draft law,"" CIAA Director
General Mella Frewen added.
 Beer, wine and spirits should be excluded from the
nutritional labelling requirements, the parliament said.
 MEPs rejected a proposal specifying the layout and minimum
font size for labels, and said simply that they should be
""clearly legible.""
 
 NO TO NATIONAL LABELS
 EU countries should not be allowed to adopt national
labelling requirements that go beyond the EU regulations, MEPs
said, which would prevent them from implementing their own
traffic light systems, for example.
 The traffic light label was developed by Britain's Food
Standards Agency and is used by some UK retailers such as J
Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer, though others including Tesco
have resisted the scheme.
 ""The question of whether the British will have to abolish
their system hasn't been clarified,"" the German centre-right MEP
who led the parliament's debate on labelling, Renate Sommer,
said after the vote.
 When asked, the EU's executive European Commission failed to
give a clear answer to the question, Sommer added.
 The labelling rules were proposed in 2008 and are unlikely
to be finalised this year or next, with EU governments not due
to adopt their first-reading position until February 2011 and a
second reading almost inevitable, Sommer said.
 ""When the regulation will come into force I can't tell you,
but it'll still be a long process,"" she said.
 Some EU governments have backed the idea of mandatory
country-of-origin labels for certain products during their
initial discussions, but their position on most of the other
proposals is still unclear.
 When the rules are finally agreed, companies should have at
least three years to implement the nutritional labelling
requirements, the parliament agreed.

 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded and the
euro pared losses to trade flat on Wednesday after BP Plc
agreed to put about $20 billion into a fund to cover claims
resulting from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
 Wall Street turned around on news BP reached a tentative
agreement to open an escrow fund demanded by U.S. President
Barack Obama, halting a slide sparked by data showing U.S.
housing starts fell more than expected in May.
 The euro was little changed against the dollar as the

 A lower euro and declining U.S. stocks earlier in the
session had given government debt prices a boost, as a tight
correlation between bond and stock prices continued to dominate
markets.
 European shares closed up higher as early gains in the oil
sector offset a slide in Nokia  shares after it
issued a profit warning, saying profitability at its key phones
unit would be weaker than expected this quarter.
 Nokia dropped 8.9 percent, wiping about 2.7 billion euros
($3.3 billion) off its market capitalization.

 Oil rebounded on the BP escrow news, rising from below $77
a barrel after a U.S. government inventory report showed crude
inventories posted an unexpected increase last week.
[ID:nSGE65F05Q]
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude
inventories rose 1.7 million barrels last week, against
expectations that stockpiles would be down 1.2 million barrels.

 ""It looks bearish to me. Perhaps it's going to put the
brakes on the rally of the last few days,"" said Antoine Halff

 U.S. crude for July  rose 81 cents to $77.75 a
barrel.
 ICE Brent crude  for delivery in August rose $1.32
to $78.12.
 The euro's rebound this week lost steam after the premium
investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish government bonds over
German bunds hit a euro life high on a report that the European
Union, the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury
were drawing up a liquidity plan for Spain. [ID;nLDE65F0GX]
 The European Commission denied the report.
 Spanish banks' reliance on European Central Bank funding
increased to record levels in May, according to RBS research.
 ""The banks in Spain are facing a liquidity freeze with
other banks reluctant to lend to Spanish banks,"" said Fergal
Smith, managing market strategist in Canada at Action Economics
in Toronto.
 Worries about the Spanish banking sector drove investors to
the safety of the euro zone's benchmark bund debt, with 10-year
spreads on Greek, Portuguese, Irish and Italian debt widening.
[ID:nLDE65F23Y]
 The Spanish 10-year yield  shot up 14 basis
points to a near two-year high of 4.94 percent.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up
8/32 in price to yield 3.28 percent, pushed higher by data that
showed housing starts fell 10 percent in May to a five-month
low. Starts in April were revised lower.
 ""The housing start numbers weren't great, and you have the
concerns about Spain and other euro zone countries' debt
situation,"" said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at Swarthmore

 By Jonathan Gleave
 MADRID, June 16 (Reuters) - The Spanish government is
proposing sharp cuts in subsidies for solar plants, which could
hurt both domestic and international solar companies operating
in the country, industry lobbyists said on Wednesday.
 Spain wants to cut existing solar panel plants' subsidies by
30 percent and future ones by 45 percent for big floor-mounted
units and 25 percent for smaller roof mounted ones, Spanish
solar power lobby ASIF spokesman Tomas Diaz said.
 ""This (proposal) would destroy the government's
renewables-friendly policy and kill us all off,"" Diaz said after
solar lobby groups met with Spain's Secretary of State for
Energy Pedro Marin.
 ""We don't think the sector can survive if it accepts these
proposals,"" Diaz said.
 An Industry Ministry spokesman declined to comment on the
proposed subsidy cuts.
 In an effort to reduce a huge deficit between the real cost
of producing power and the subsidised price consumers pay for
it, the government is working out a new renewables subsidy
scheme, which is expected before the end of the month.
 Solar power, which had exponential growth in 2008 that has
already led to cuts in subsidies and caps on future development,
is largely expected to be the hardest hit by the subsidy
reductions.
 The solar subsidy cuts would likely be introduced before
October, though the government wants to introduce them
immediately and has given the sector two days to decide how cuts
for existing plants should be applied, the spokesman said.
 ""It's like asking someone condemned to death whether whey
want the electric chair or a lethal injection,"" he said.
 Spain's larger windpower sector is also meeting with the
industry ministry this evening for ongoing talks on its own
subsidy review, a spokeswoman for sector lobby AEE said, but
declined to comment on the government proposals until talks have
ended.

 * Companies breaking the rules will face fines, trading bans
 * Environmentalists say rules will reduce forest destruction
 
 By Charlie Dunmore
 BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - The sale of illegally
harvested timber and timber products will be banned throughout
the European Union from late 2012 under an informal deal struck
by EU lawmakers and seen by Reuters.
 Environmental campaigners on Wednesday said the agreement
would help stop companies profiting from forest destruction and
close the door to illegal timber imports into Europe, the
world's largest market for wood products.
 The new rules were agreed by negotiators from the European
Parliament, the Spanish EU presidency and the EU's executive
European Commission, and must still be rubber-stamped by EU
governments and the full parliament before they enter force.
 The ban covers raw timber and timber products such as
furniture, casks and floorboards, though printed materials such
as books will be exempt for at least five years, according to
the agreement.
 Companies will have to carry out due diligence and risk
assessments to ensure that any timber was legally logged, and
those that break the rules will face fines and trading bans.
 Environmental group Greenpeace said the deal was backed by a
significant majority of EU countries, with only a handful led by
Sweden and Portugal opposed.
 ""With this law, the black economy for wood products in
Europe will be closed for business, levelling the playing field
so companies are better able to act sustainably,"" Greenpeace
forest policy director Sebastien Risso said.
 Last year environmental groups estimated that Europe buys
1.2 billion euros ($1.48 billion) worth of illegally felled
timber a year, about 20 percent of its imports.
 Greenpeace said illegal logging accounted for up to 90
percent of all timber harvested in Indonesia, over 60 percent in
the Brazilian Amazon, and up to half harvested in Cameroon
between 1999 and 2004.
 The parliament is expected to approve the deal in early
July, and once EU governments have rubber-stamped them, the new
rules will enter force in late 2012.

 * Worries about Spain's credit markets hit sentiment
 * U.S. housing starts plunge; industrial output rises
(Updates prices, adds comment)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro was little changed
against the dollar on Wednesday, as a recovery in U.S. stocks
lifted risk appetite and offset fresh concerns about Spain's
credit and banking system.
 A plunge in U.S. housing starts in May to their lowest
level in five months also weighed on sentiment earlier, though
it was mitigated by stronger-than-expected industrial
production data.
 The euro's rebound this week lost steam after the premium
investors demand to hold 10-year Spanish government bonds over
German bunds hit a euro lifetime high after a report that the
European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the U.S.
Treasury were drawing up a liquidity plan for Spain. The
European Commission denied the report by Spanish newspaper El
Economista.
 ""We had such a great rally yesterday so a pullback was
somewhat expected,"" said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of FX
sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
 ""The worsening situation Spain sort of rattled the market,""
he added. ""We also had a fairly poor housing start number and
that further (boosted) risk aversion.""
 In midday New York trading, the euro was slightly lower on
the day at $1.2322, after rising as high as $1.2354 on
electronic trading platform EBS, the strongest level in two
weeks.
 Spain's central bank will publish stress tests on its
lenders and Germany is coordinating disclosure at the EU level,
they said on Wednesday, moving Europe's banking sector closer
to putting its financial health on public display.
 ""The banks in Spain are facing a liquidity freeze with
other banks reluctant to lend to Spanish banks,"" said Fergal
Smith, managing market strategist, Canada at Action Economics
in Toronto. ""That's helped cap the recent rally in the euro and
in riskier assets.""
 Against the yen, the euro was also slightly lower at 112.63
yen.
 SELL ON BOUNCE
 Some analysts said the recent recovery in the euro looked
short-term but could have further to go.
 ""We look for the correction higher to extend to
$1.2445/1.2570 -- the 2009 low and the 38.2 percent retracement
of the move down from April,"" analysts at Commerzbank said.
 Traders cited demand in the $1.2270 area from Middle East
accounts, with option-related bids then seen at $1.2250.
 One-month EUR/USD 25-delta put options were up slightly,
suggesting the trend for the euro remains lower, though the
negative sentiment is somewhat easing.
 Mizuho's Eliasson said he still expects the euro to fall
back below $1.20, especially as trading volume declines going
into the summer months. Europe's debt woes will continue to
take a toll on the single currency, he said.
 ""I don't think the worst is over. I still think you're
going to see further downgrades. The recovery there is going to
be very slow,"" he said. ""If anything, I would sell it on
rallies.""
 Against the yen, the dollar was little changed at 91.39
yen, hitting a session low after the weaker-than-expected U.S.
housing data.
 ""Lousy permits, lousy starts. It's just not looking very
good and I'm not surprised to see that markets are reacting
negatively to the data,"" said Kurt Karl, chief U.S. economist,
Swiss Re, New York.
 The dollar fell to its lowest in a month against the Swiss
franc at 1.1260 francs. The franc also strengthened versus the
euro, ahead of Thursday's Swiss National Bank policy meeting.
 Traders said option volatility was high, indicating market
nerves around the SNB meeting, especially given the currency
has shifted in low volumes in recent weeks. The options market
was showing less of a bias for a strengthening franc, they
said.

 By Laurence Fletcher
 MONACO, June 16 (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds and
pension funds are backing start-up or small hedge funds again,
said FRM Capital Advisors, bucking a trend seen since the credit
crisis for clients to favour the perceived safety of big funds.
 Patric de Gentile-Williams, chief operating officer of hedge
fund seeding specialist FRM, said his portfolios have raised a
net $70 million so far this year -- after raising ""very little""
in 2009 -- and he expects further commitments.
 Total assets stand at about $360 million.
 ""Investors are allocating to this space,"" he said in an
interview on the sidelines of the GAIM hedge fund conference
here. ""We're seeing the most sophisticated investors look at
this space.
 ""It (the $70 million) is the first part of what we expect to
be a series of capital raisings. It's a very strong pipeline.
Conversations will, I think, lead somewhere, whereas last year
conversations were about maintenance of (relationships).""
 
 
 
 Investors were happy to back start-up or small-scale hedge
funds during the industry's pre-credit crisis boom -- when
high-earning traders would leave a bank and set up on their own
-- in the hope of unearthing a talented manager.
 However, following the downturn and a number of blow-ups and
frauds in the industry, investors have preferred to stick with
bigger funds, which they often regard as safer or having better
risk management.
 De Gentile-Williams said investors such as sovereign wealth
funds, large pension funds, family offices and some insurance
funds were looking at committing between 5 and 10 percent of
their hedge fund allocations via fund managers such as FRM and
other firms.
 ""It's pension funds with large hedge fund portfolios, saying
'it's clearly part of the hedge fund space, we should have an
allocation of 5-10 percent to start-ups, seeding and young
managers',"" he said.
 ""We've seen some competitors spring up. Very large
institutions are getting their own program run by a specialist
manager.
 Seed investors give money to start-up or small-scale
managers in return for a share of the fund's revenues in the
future or a stake in the management company.
 De Gentile-Williams also said over the past year he had
increased the average size of investments he is making with
small-scale managers to around $50 million from around $40
million.
 ""We were doing 40s, now we're doing 50s. It allows managers
to grow faster.""

 By Herbert Lash
 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S. dollar on
Wednesday on fresh concerns about Spain's debt, while global stocks faltered
after data showed U.S. housing starts fell more than expected in May to a
five-month low.
 Demand for safe-haven assets like bonds and gold rose as U.S. homebuilding
suffered from the expiration of a popular homebuyer tax credit that had buoyed
construction over the past two months. For details see: [ID:nN1563166]
 Bund futures hit a session high and U.S. Treasury debt prices added to
gains, with the 30-year bond rising a full point following the data, which
showed May housing starts fell 10 percent and starts in April were revised
lower.
 September Bund futures  rose as much as 40 ticks on the day to a
session high of 128.70. The Spanish/German 10-year government bond yield spread
widened to 222 basis points, a euro lifetime high, following the report.
[ID:nLDE65F1H1]
 The 10-year Treasury note  was up 10/32 in price to yield 3.27
percent. [ID:nN16142157]
 European shares extended losses on the housing data, but then turned
higher. Wall Street opened lower as a profit warning from Nokia Corp
  and cost constraints at FedEx Corp  put a damper on
sentiment. [ID:nLDE65F1F8]
 ""The housing start numbers weren't great, and you have the concerns about
Spain and other euro zone countries' debt situation,"" said Kurt Brunner,
portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia.
 He said the Nokia and FedEx results painted a picture of an economic
recovery that could be ""slower and more difficult.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> hovered near break-even after
hitting its highest level since mid-May earlier in the session, and the MSCI
emerging markets index <.MSCIEF> rose 0.5 percent.
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> also rose slightly, extending a rally
to six days.
 At 10 a.m., the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 35.37 points,
or 0.34 percent, at 10,369.40. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was down
3.37 points, or 0.30 percent, at 1,111.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
was down 5.19 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,300.69.
 In early New York trading, the euro fell 0.3  percent to $1.2289,
after rising as high as $1.2354 on electronic trading platform EBS, the
strongest level in two weeks.
 LIQUIDITY FREEZE
 Spanish banks' reliance on European Central Bank funding increased to
record levels in May, according to RBS research.
 ""The banks in Spain are facing a liquidity freeze with other banks
reluctant to lend to Spanish banks,"" said Fergal Smith, managing market
strategist in Canada at Action Economics in Toronto.
 ""That's helped cap the recent rally in the euro and in riskier assets.
We've seen Treasuries rally today, (the) euro/dollar come off,"" he added.
 Gold rose 75 cents to $1,234.20 an ounce, with demand for the metal as a
haven holding firm on widening spreads between Spanish and German government
bond yields. [ID:nLDE65F0SR]
 Industrial metal prices also fell from two-week highs, as the weak U.S.
housing data stoked concerns about the demand outlook for copper.
[ID:nLDE65F0L4]
 Oil prices initially fell toward $76 a barrel after a surprise hike in
crude inventories in the United States, and on news of the weaker U.S. housing
data. [ID:nSGE65F05Q] Prices later turned slightly positive.
 U.S. light sweet crude oil  rose 7 cents, or 0.09 percent, to $77.01
a barrel.
 U.S. crude inventories jumped 579,000 barrels in the week to June 11 and
oil product stocks rose across the board, weekly data from the American
Petroleum Institute (API) trade group said on Tuesday. [API/S]
 ""When you look at the last data on the API side, it showed an increase in
crude oil. We are also looking at a big jump in gasoline stocks, and that could
be pretty bearish for oil,"" said Christopher Barret, an oil analyst at Credit
Agricole.

between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan could hinder
international trade and dent their plans to join the World Trade

 Russia, which has spent 16 years negotiating to join the
WTO, surprised the world last year when Prime Minister Vladimir

its former Soviet neighbours Belarus and Kazakhstan.
 That three-way union is expected formally to come into force

and Belarus over oil-export duties.
 Speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the EU's
high representative for foreign affairs, Catherine Ashton, said
the pending union had raised concerns in Europe.
 ""We have no issues with customs unions in general ... but we
are concerned when those hinder trade rather than promoting it,""
she said. ""That appears to be the case with the proposed customs
union.""
 Moscow suspended talks with the WTO last year after it
announced its plans for the Belarus-Kazakhstan customs union,
but is expected to resume the WTO discussions this month.
 The EU said last month that Russia could join the WTO within
a year, amid generally better ties with Brussels and Washington.

 By Jonathan Cable
 LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - There is a continuing divergence
in the rate of recovery among the world's richest nations,
Reuters polls show, as the European debt crisis continues to
hamper economies across the continent.
 The growth path for 2010 in the United States -- the world's
largest economy -- has been revised higher, running away from
the euro zone and Britain and also outstripping Japan, according
to surveys of over 250 economists taken June 10-16.
 The euro zone's economy is expected to grow a mere 1.1
percent this year and 1.4 percent next. Across the channel major
trading partner Britain is on a similar path, with forecasted
1.1 percent growth this year and a healthier 2.1 percent in
2011.
 ""Signs of a strong rebound remain conspicuously absent,""
said Christoph Weil at Commerzbank.
 ""In the summer the euro zone economy will grow significantly
more slowly, as the debt crisis in the peripheral countries will
exert progressively greater drag.""
 The bloc and Britain have both seen their currencies
hammered on fears about sovereign indebtedness, while concerns
over a budget deficit running close to 11 percent of gross
domestic product has added its weight to sterling.
 Things look rosier for Japan, whose economy is seen growing
2.5 percent in the fiscal year to next March on solid exports,
but even this lags the United States, where gross domestic
product (GDP) is predicted to grow 3.2 percent on average in
2010.
 All but the U.S. saw their 2011 forecasts nudged down from
last month's poll while 2010 predictions for the U.S., Japan and
the euro zone were revised up.
 ""As yet, our growth forecast has been pared down only
slightly due to mild contagion from the European debt crisis --
any further downward revision will hinge upon the length and
depth of the concerns over sovereign debt,"" said Ellen Zentner,
senior economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
 The economies emerged from their deepest recession since the
Second World War last year and economists gave a one-in-four
chance of a double-dip in the euro zone and Britain, but only a
15 percent chance the U.S. would slump back and a 20 percent
chance for Japan.
 Governments and central banks have pumped hundreds of
billions of dollars into programmes designed to kick-start their
battered economies but the huge costs of these recovery packages
must be repaid.
 As Group of 20 world leaders prepare for next week's summit
in Toronto, disagreements are becoming more frequent and
decades-old policy biases are resurfacing.
 After two years of matching economic policy moves the U.S.
and Europe are parting ways, with debt-wary Germany pressing for
a swift clamp-down on public spending while the U.S. preaches
patience. 
 Mindful of the Great Depression, U.S. policymakers insist
economic recovery is a prerequisite for repairing public
finances. European leaders fearful of runaway inflation argue
fiscal restraint is required for restoring the confidence that
is necessary for growth.
 
 INFLATION IRKS
 Economists now expect Japan to pull out of deflation next
fiscal year, ending in March 2012, and in Britain -- where
prices have been rising much faster compared to its major
trading partners -- inflation is seen dropping below the central
bank's two percent target to 1.9 percent in 2011.
 Inflation is seen at 1.4 percent in the U.S. and 1.5 percent
in the 16-nation euro zone, giving the central bank's scope to
hold interest rates low and boost the struggling economies.
 Central banks are seen holding rates at record lows for some
time yet, the Bank of England and European Central Bank are not
seen budging until next year while the U.S. Federal Reserve is
not seen hiking rates to 0.5 percent until early next year,
later than seen in last month's poll.
The Bank of Japan, which has rates at just 0.1 percent, is
not seen making a move until 2012 at the earliest as it battles
deflation.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2010 09:15AM ET</span>",INTERVIEW-Climate chief: EU must fight for green-tech jobs," * EU's Hedegaard: don't take green-tech jobs for granted
 * No border taxes for now, sectoral deals preferred
 * Global technology cooperation better than tech transfer
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - Europe's green-technology
industries need determined political backing if they are to
outpace rivals in Asia, Europe's climate chief said on
Wednesday.
 European Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard observed the
fine balance Europe must strike with China and other swiftly
developing regions, sometimes as trade rivals and other times as
partners in tackling climate change.
 ""Europe must do whatever we can to protect and develop our
stronghold within the energy-efficient and renewables sectors,""
she told Reuters in an interview. 
 ""There's a growing recognition that our strong position is
not automatic in the next decade,"" she added. ""We must fight for
it.""
 Hedegaard spoke amid a tense European debate over whether to
deepen planned cuts to carbon dioxide emissions over the next
decade to 30 percent below 1990 levels, compared to current
plans for a 20 percent cut.
 Europe's powerful business lobby has successfully fought off
the prospect of deeper cuts, saying they would make traditional
heavy industries such as steel and cement lose market share to
less-regulated overseas rivals -- so-called ""carbon leakage"".
 But many of Europe's greener governments are starting to
worry that staying at 20 percent would undermine the EU carbon
market, which makes industry pay for permits to pollute and
provides the main incentive for green innovation.
 France, Britain and Spain are among them.
 ""Yes, there can be carbon leakage if you are too ambitious,
but you can also lose jobs if you are standing still while your
competitors are moving ... if you are not innovating enough,""
Hedegaard said. ""We must find the right balance point.""
 
 BORDER TARIFFS
 She declined to speculate on whether Europe would deepen
emissions cuts on its own if international climate talks fail
again to reach a deal in Cancun, Mexico in December. 
 But she raised the difficult question of Europe's growth
prospects if it does not increase the pressure for innovation in
the face of strong competition from China, Japan, Brazil and
South Korea.
 ""What are we going to live from in Europe?"" she said. ""There
are so many things we cannot compete on. We cannot compete on
taxes, wages or pension ages. Here we have one area where we
still have a worldwide front-runner position and we should take
care to keep that.""
 Some European countries, notably France and Italy, have
raised the prospect of protecting European industries by placing
border tariffs on imports from bigger polluters. But Hedegaard
said premature action could damage global talks and the threat
was enough in itself.
 ""Border tax could be one of the tools in the toolbox,"" she
said. ""I think it should stay there. If we did it right now, how
likely is it we could get a result around the negotiating table?
It's difficult already.""
 
 TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
 An alternative is to pursue sectoral agreements on cutting
greenhouse gases, and Hedegaard said China was proving to be a
valuable partner in this area.
 ""They know they particularly have to address the challenges
within cement, aluminium and steel,"" she said. ""They mentioned
these sectors. And where do we have the biggest threats of
carbon leakage in Europe? Cement, aluminium and steel. We could
cooperate in finding solutions.""
 Sectoral crediting would allow European companies to offset
their emissions by funding cuts in developing countries, focused
on sectors rather than individual companies.
 ""Next month, some experts from my services will go to
Beijing and work with Chinese experts,"" she added. ""This is
really happening. Just two years back it would have been
unthinkable.""
 But while China is a partner in some areas, it is clearly
also a competitor in manufacturing.
 So-called ""technology transfer"" has become a mantra in
international climate talks for poor nations, which say they
need technical help to cut emissions. The latest United Nations
negotiating text lists it as a top priority.
 But Hedegaard described a more nuanced approach.
 ""Technology cooperation has been more in focus in recent
years, and technology dissemination,"" she said. ""Nobody foresees
we should just give away our technology and make it even easier
for China or others to compete with us.""

 * Recovery to be modest, uneven
 * Quaden may step down once new Belgian government formed
 
 (Adds detail)
 BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - A modest economic recovery is
taking shape in the euro zone but its countries face two major
challenges: reducing their deficits and reinforcing growth,
European Central Bank Governing Council member Guy Quaden said.
 Concerns over bloated public finances and low economic
growth have led to a sharp rise in borrowing costs for some of
the 16 euro zone countries, forcing governments to announce
fiscal austerity steps that are likely to slow growth further.
 ""The moment has arrived where we need to reduce public
deficits in Belgium and in Europe not just to please markets and
European institutions, but also to reassure households and
companies,"" said Quaden, governor of Belgium's central bank.
 China, India and Brazil were fuelling global growth, he
added, and the recovery in Europe was modest compared to other
industrialised countries.
 A double-dip recession was not the most credible scenario
for the euro zone, according to the ECB's forecasts, said Quaden
who was presenting the national bank's spring forecasts.
 ""The most credible scenario for us is a recovery which
remains relatively modest and uneven,"" he said.
 There was no expectation of deflation in the euro zone,
Quaden said.
 The European Central Bank would do all it could to
counteract possible inflationary risks that might arise from its
sovereign bond purchases.
 ""We want to contribute to a better functioning of the
markets in general, the markets of public debt in particular,
but our main objective is and will remain price stability,""
Quaden said.
 
 QUADEN TO STAND DOWN?
Quaden hinted he might step down as governor of the Belgian
central bank once a new Belgian government is formed, but not
before then.
 Quaden was reappointed for a third term in February 2009,
but said at the time he would be prepared to step down in August
2010, when he turns 65.
 ""I said that since this was my third mandate, I did not
necessarily want to complete it,"" Quaden said. He would however
stay on until a new government was formed following last
Sunday's parliamentary elections, which could then appoint a new
governor.

 (Recasts, Adds detail)
 BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - Belgium's central bank on
Wednesday raised its forecasts for economic growth and inflation
this year, but said debt-to-GDP would top 100 percent.
 The economy will grow by 1.3 percent this year, slightly
more than previously forecast, and by 1.7 percent in 2011 after
contracting by 3.0 percent in 2009, Central bank governor Guy
Quaden said.
 Quaden, presenting the bank's spring economic forecasts,
said for industrialised countries, 2009 had been the worst year
in economic terms since World War II.
 ""It is a severe recession, but it will not be a severe
depression,"" Quaden, a member of the European Central Bank's
Governing Council said, adding: ""Growth is still too modest.""
 Belgium's ratio of debt to gross domestic product ratio
would once again rise above 100 percent this year as a result of
the financial crisis and the bailout of the country's banks,
Quaden said, having dipped to as low as 84.2 percent in 2007
from a high of 133.6 percent in 1993.
 Belgium's public sector deficit was forecast at 5.0 percent
this year, revised from 5.4 percent. For next year, the bank
forecast a deficit of 5.3 percent.
 The bank also raised its 2010 inflation forecast to 2.0
percent from 1.6 percent. For 2011, it saw inflation at 1.9
percent. Inflation would be driven by food and petrol prices.
 Inflation in Belgium peaked at 5.9 percent in July 2008, but
has fallen sharply since then.
 Quaden said there was no fear of permanent negative
inflation.

 * Planting of key crops to gain momentum only next month
 * Weather office to forecast July rains next week
(Adds details, impact on crop plantings)
 By Ratnajyoti Dutta
 NEW DELHI, June 16 (Reuters) - India's monsoon, crucial to
its crops, is running four to five days behind schedule and has
yet to reach half of its territory, though rains are expected
by the weekend, senior weather department sources said on
Wednesday.
 A good monsoon is vital to defuse supply-side inflationary
pressure in Asia's third-largest economy and allow the
government to press ahead with key economic reforms, such as
freeing up fuel prices, that may not be possible if prices
remain high.
 The progress of the country's annual rains is ""behind
schedule,"" said a senior official of the India Meteorological
Department, who did not wish to be named, adding, ""The monsoon
is likely to revive in the next two to three days.""
 He ruled out any cause for concern now, despite the delay
in the progress of monsoon, which has usually covered central
and western India by mid-June.
 Officials said there was no cause to worry over the rice,
cane, cotton and soybean crops.
 ""There is no need to panic even if rains over central India
get delayed by 5 to 7 days,"" said L.S. Rathore, head of the
agricultural meteorology division of the weather office, adding
that initial hiccups were not serious aberrations and a swift
progress of the monsoon winds could make up an early deficit.
 Rathore and other experts said the July rains hold the key
to farm output.
 ""Crops will gain immensely if next month's rains are good
and well distributed,"" said S.L. Gupta, secretary of the Uttar
Pradesh Sugar Mills Association.
The monsoon, after an initial lull this month, has entered the
rice, cane and oilseed growing south-western region of India,
but has yet to reach the soybean-growing areas of central India
and northern Uttar Pradesh, the country's top cane growing
state.
 Last year the weather department turned out to be wrong in
its prediction of rains for the annual southwest monsoon, which
runs from June to September, and many traders remain wary of
this year's forecast as well.
 ""Rains occured a bit in some parts. But it does not look
like monsoon rains,"" said Rajesh Agrawal, spokesman of the
Soybean Processors Association of India, based in central
India.
 He said soybean sowing would start in central India once
monsoon fully sets in by next week as predicted.
 DEFICIENT RAINS
 For the first fortnight of the four-month season, overall
rains were deficient as the super cyclone Phet over the Arabian
Sea slowed the initial progress of the monsoon.
 Rainfall since June 1, the start of the season, was seven
percent below a normal of 62.4 mm, sources in the weather
office, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
 The monsoon hit India's southern tip on May 31, a day ahead
of schedule.
 D. Sivananda Pai, director of the National Climate Center
in the western city of Pune, told Reuters he was still
forecasting a normal monsoon for this season.
 Heavy rains were expected over the central-western region
later this week, said Pai, ruling out any weak phase this week.
 The weather office will update its forecast next week.
 Government policy makers are hoping good rains, after last
year's drought, will help rein in inflation, currently at more
than 10 percent, and provide room to ease curbs on export of
wheat and rice. High food prices have also sparked street
protests.
 Soaring inflation had also been a key concern for an Indian
government panel empowered to decide on easing state controls
on fuel prices.

Wednesday a series of measures to divert hot money away from
the short end of the debt market, including imposing a minimum

 Following are details of the measures:
* The central bank widens the spread between the overnight
repo rate, or standing lending facility, and the benchmark BI
rate to 100 basis points from 50 basis points previously,
effective June 17. This raises the overnight repo rate to 7.5
percent from 7 percent previously.
* The central bank widens the spread between the Fasbi rate,
or standing deposit facility, and the BI rate to 100 basis
points from 50 basis points previously, effective June 17. This
brings the Fasbi rate down to 5.5 percent from 6 percent
previously.
* The central bank imposes a minimum one-month holding period
for investors buying SBI debt, effective July 7. There was no
such requirement before.
* The central bank will issue 9-month SBIs starting in the
second week of August 2010, and 12-month SBIs from the second
week of September 2010.
* The central bank will introduce a new monetary instrument, a
one-month rupiah term deposit. It will start auctioning the
paper from July 7. This will not be exchangeable but investors
could redeem early subject to certain conditions.
* Under a previous scheme, overall foreign exchange net open
positions of commercial banks must be kept at a maximum 20
percent of the banks' capital at all times, but under the new
scheme banks may exceed the limit as long as this lasts no
longer than 30 minutes, effective July 1, 2010.
* The net open position may fluctuate partly because of
foreign exchange transactions done by commercial banks. The
move is aimed at deepening the foreign exchange market.
* Bank Indonesia jointly with the government and private
institutions plans to introduce a scheme next year under which
the central bank may accept government debt paper held by
corporates such as pension funds and insurance firms in its
repo operations.

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - World stocks rose to a one-month
high on Wednesday and the euro briefly hit a two-week peak as
strong gains on Wall Street encouraged fresh risk-taking, while
lingering euro zone debt concerns limited aggressive buying.
 German 10-year bond yields fell while spreads between
Spanish and German 10-year debt spreads hit a euro lifetime high
as investors remained concerned about Spain's credit markets and
the region's banking sector.
 U.S. stock futures fell, pointing to a weaker open on Wall
Street, a day after the S&P 500 index <.SPX> turned positive for
the year and rose above its 200-day moving average for the first
time in a month.
""On a momentum basis, if we track the U.S. higher then
there's a good case that we can push higher from here but it's
going to be very hard going indeed if Spanish bond yields keep
going north,"" said Geoff Wilkinson, head of investment research
at Mint.
 ""The fact that we're up suggests that equity markets are
ignoring credit concerns for the time being but ultimately
credit and debt are a much better predictor of where equity
markets are heading.""
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.2
percent after hitting its highest level since mid-May. The
FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.1 percent, extending a
rally to six days. Emerging stocks <.MSCIEF> gained 0.4 percent.
 The European Commission on Wednesday denied a report that
the European Union, the IMF and the U.S. Treasury were drawing
up a liquidity plan for Spain including a credit line of up to
250 billion euros.
 The Spanish/German 10-year government bond yield spread
widened to 222 basis points, a euro lifetime high, following the

 By Neal Armstrong
 LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro briefly hit a two-week
high on Wednesday, aided by improved risk tolerance after a
strong rally in U.S. equities, though the move lacked momentum
required to tackle nearby resistance.
 The single currency made a show above Tuesday's two-week
peak at $1.2350, with traders and technical analysts suggesting
it had scope to extend gains after a strong rally in the S&P 500
illustrated improving risk sentiment in global markets.
 At 0718 GMT, the euro had steadied to trade flat on the day
at $1.2325 from its earlier high of $1.2355.
 ""The euro's recent rally can continue. It's been tracking
the improvement in risk and the higher-yielding currencies, but
for now there's nothing to provide much of an impetus to take it
significantly higher,"" said Stuart Bennett, senior FX strategist
at Credit Agricole CIB.
 He added a daily close above $1.2350 on Wednesday would be a
sign that the recent rally, which had cleared out some stale
short positions, could go further.
 Technical analysts were increasingly positive on the outlook
for the single currency.
 ""We look for the correction higher to extend to
$1.2445/1.2570 - the 2009 low and the 38.2 percent retracement
of the move down from April,"" analysts at Commerzbank said.
 On Tuesday, investors set aside concerns about the euro
zone financial sector and soft economic data to buy riskier
assets, higher-yielding currencies and the euro, looking on the
bright side after Spain raised 5.2 billion euros at a debt
auction and Belgium netted 2.5 billion euros.
 
 EQUITIES IN FOCUS
 Higher-yielding currencies were in focus on Wednesday after
the broad rally in equities spurred appetite for riskier assets.
 ""Markets are focusing more on equity markets so
equity-sensitive currencies like the Aussie, kiwi, Canadian
dollar and the Swedish crown could be the main focus,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Japan.
 The Australian dollar held near the month's highs against
both the dollar and the yen but failing to capitalise on gains
of 1 percent in Asian shares.
 It was flat on the day at $0.8637, not far below a one-month
high near $0.8670 struck on Monday.
 The Aussie was steady at 79.05 yen, pausing ahead of
resistance at 80.00, a 50 percent retracement of its fall from
just above 88.00 in late April to its May low of 71.89.
 The New Zealand dollar fell 0.6 percent to $0.6950, with
traders saying a comment by Finance Minister Bill English on
trying to ensure the rate hike cycle was not as vicious as in
the past was weighing on the currency.
 It also lost ground to the Aussie, which rose sharply to its
highest in two weeks against the kiwi.
 The euro was up around 0.4 percent versus the yen at 113.10
yen, as the Japanese currency weakened.
 The dollar was slightly stronger at 91.68 yen, in the middle
of a four yen range it has held since mid-May.
 The dollar index was little moved at 85.996, hovering above
support near 85.85 which was a low it marked on May 28
 But it slipped to its lowest in a month against the Swiss
franc at 1.1277 francs. The franc also strengthened versus the
euro, with Thursday's SNB policy meeting looming.

 By Charlotte Cooper
 TOKYO, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro steadied near a two-week
high against the dollar on Wednesday, as investors in Asia
hesitated to chase its short-covering rally further, while higher
yielding currencies stalled after rallying alongside stocks.
 The euro paused ahead of resistance at $1.2350-55 although
traders and chartists said it still had scope to extend its gains
after a rise in the S&P 500 improved risk tolerance, with some
looking for a move above $1.24 and beyond.
 Holidays in China and Hong Kong helped keep Asian currency
market activity subdued after Wall Street rallied more than 2
percent and the S&P 500 rose above its 200-day moving average for
the first time in a month, suggesting the recent downtrend may be
nearing an end.
 Japanese investors are wary of the euro's move higher, which
has been spurred by short-covering from a four-year low of
$1.1876 set earlier in June, and are trying to gauge how solid
the rise is, said a currency trader at a Japanese brokerage.
 At the same time, he and others said the euro, while still in
a downtrend, may have further to go before the end of the
quarter.
 ""Short-covering and European banks' repatriation will keep
the euro buoyant for at least for another week,"" the trader said.
 The euro rose 0.9 percent on Tuesday, touching $1.2350, its
strongest since June 1. By Wednesday it had trickled back to
$1.2335, with support expected from its 55-hour moving average
coming in about $1.2250.
 After $1.2350-55, resistance is layered at $1.2370, a 61.8
percent retracement of its late May high to its June low, at
$1.2450, which is a late May reaction high, and at $1.2550-70, a
38.2 percent retracement from mid-April highs to the June low.
 On Tuesday, investors set aside concerns about the euro zone
financial sector and soft economic data to buy riskier assets,
higher-yielding currencies and the euro, preferring to look on
the bright side after Spain raised 5.2 billion euros ($6.42
billion) at an auction and Belgium netted 2.5 billion euros.
 Analysts said the market was watching the rebound in
equities.
 ""Markets are not very sensitive to fundamental news because
they are pushing back their interest rate forecasts,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Japan.
 ""Markets are focusing more on equity markets so
equity-sensitive currencies like the Aussie, kiwi, Canadian
dollar and the Swedish crown could be the main focus.""

at 80.00, a 50 percent retracement of its fall from just above

which Japanese retail margin traders are expected to take
profits.

 The dollar index edged up to 86.03, hovering above support
near 85.85 which was a low it marked on May 28
 But it slipped to its lowest in a month against the Swiss

 The Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar were holding
up near the month's highs against both the dollar and the yen but
failing to capitalise on gains of 1 percent in Asian shares.
 The Aussie slipped 0.1 percent on the day to $0.8637, not far
below a one-month high near $0.8670 struck on Monday.
 It was steady at 79.10 yen, pausing before resistance at
80.00, a 50 percent retracement of its fall from just above 88.00
in late April to its a low of 71.89 in May and a point at which
Japanese retail margin traders are expected to take profits.
 The euro eased 0.1 percent to 112.66 yen, after topping
113.00 on Tuesday to touch its strongest level in two weeks.
 The dollar was flat on the day at 91.46 yen, in the middle of
a 4-yen range it has held since mid-May.
 The dollar index edged up to 86.06, hovering above support
near 85.85 which was a low it marked on May 28.

 By Alex Richardson
 SINGAPORE, June 16 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on
Wednesday, led by electronics makers and resource stocks, after
successful European debt auctions boosted hopes for global
growth and lifted commodity prices.
 Financial bookmakers were expecting European shares to rise
for a sixth session in a row, with spreadbetters calling
London's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 to open
0.5-0.9 percent higher.
 The euro steadied near its highest in 2 weeks, and easing
fears about Europe's debt crisis also fuelled gains for
higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar.
 Industrial raw materials also gained, with copper up for a
seventh day running to post its longest winning streak since at
least 1993, while crude oil extended its rally into a third
day.
 ""Oil is basically moving with stock markets and the stock
markets are moving with optimism and pessimism over the euro,""
said Keichi Sano, general manager of research at SCM Securities
in Tokyo.
 Tokyo's Nikkei rose 1.8 percent to close above 10,000
points for the first time in nearly a month, picking up steam
after finishing above its 25-day moving average on Tuesday.
 ""The speculative sell-off in response to negative news,
which we had seen up until now, might have come to a halt, and
short-covering is now picking up momentum,"" said Masaru
Hamasaki, a senior strategist at Toyota Asset Management.
 Electronics makers were the biggest contributors, with
Canon up 3.9 percent and Kyocera up 2.5 percent. The
Philadelphia semiconductor index had jumped 5.5 percent on
Tuesday after Taiwan's big contract chip makers forecast
growing demand.
 MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside Japan rose 1 percent.
 U.S. stocks gained more than 2 percent on Tuesday, with the
S&P 500 rising above its 200-day moving average for the first
time in a month, as investors took heart from successful debt
auctions in some of the euro zone's weaker members.
 ""From a technical perspective, the U.S. market retested its
200-day moving average and managed to go through it, so the
next few days will be very interesting,"" said Matt Riordan,
portfolio manager at Paradice Investment Management in Sydney.
 ""I think it will remain volatile.""
 EURO RELIEF
 The euro paused around $1.2315 having risen to as high as
$1.2350, the strongest level since June 1, in the previous
session after debt auctions in Spain, Ireland and Belgium drew
solid demand.
 The single currency has been battered for months as
investors took fright at high euro zone sovereign debt levels
and low growth prospects in several countries in the bloc.
 Some traders said a short squeeze on the euro -- with
investors who had been betting on falls scrambling to cover
their positions -- could push the currency higher.
 ""Short-covering and European banks' repatriation will keep
the euro buoyant for at least another week,"" said a currency
trader at a Japanese brokerage, adding that the euro remained
basically in a downtrend.
 The bond auctions also helped the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, higher-yielding currencies that tend to gain
on heightened risk appetite.
 ""Markets are focusing more on equity markets, so
equity-sensitive currencies like the Aussie, Kiwi, Canadian
dollar and Swedish crown could be the main focus,"" said
Masafumi Yamamoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Japan.
 Japanese government bonds dipped as stock market gains
dampened demand for safe-haven government debt, but losses were
limited as traders cautioned the European crisis still had some
months to run.
 ""The significant rise in stock prices has been taken in
stride as it is difficult for investors to become optimistic
while worries over the euro zone's debt situation continue to
simmer,"" said Makoto Noji, a senior market analyst at Mizuho
Securities.
 September 10-year JGB futures fell 0.07 point to 140.35,
pulling back from a two-year high above 141.00 struck the
previous week.
 U.S. Treasuries were steady in Asia, having fallen on
Tuesday, with few players convinced the sharp bond rally of the
past two months, which saw the benchmark 10-year yield fall to
1-year low of 3.06 percent, has run its course.
 ""The biggest reason people do not expect Treasury yields to
jump is that the market continues to believe the Federal
Reserve won't hike rates for some time,"" said a portfolio
manager at an investment management firm.
 U.S. crude futures edged up to near $77 a barrel, a day
after spiking more than 2 percent on growing investor
confidence in a global economic recovery.
 Hopes of improving demand for resources also boosted copper
for a seventh straight day, with London prices rising more than
2 percent
 That, in turn, lifted shares in the resources sector, while
Australian mining heavyweights Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, both
of which rose more than 2 percent, were also helped by signs
the Canberra government was planning revisions to its proposed
mining tax.

 * High-yielders supported by bounce in stocks
 By Anirban Nag
 SYDNEY, June 16 (Reuters) - The euro steadied near two-week
highs on Wednesday, while demand for high-yielding currencies
like the Australian dollar was underpinned by a general
improvement in risk taking.
 Investors set aside concerns about the euro zone's financial
sector and soft economic data for the moment to buy riskier
assets, higher-yielding currencies and the euro.
 Stocks on Wall Street rallied more than 2 percent with the
S&P 500 <.SPX> turning positive for the year and rising above its
200-day moving average for the first time in a month, suggesting
the recent downtrend may be nearing an end.
 Traders said the positive momentum carried through from
higher U.S. stocks should see higher yielders underpinned in the
Asian session. Also supporting the euro was a solid response to a
Spanish debt auction.
 The euro was up at $1.2315 , having risen to as high as
$1.2349, the strongest level since June 1, on Tuesday.
 Near term resistance for the euro is seen at this month's
high of $1.2353 and then at the Fibonacci retracement level of
around $1.2550, which is the 38.2 percent from the April 14 high
to its June 7 low.
 Traders do not rule out a short squeeze in the euro which
could take it higher.
 ""The data flow was soft, but at the moment investors are not
focusing on that,"" said John Horner, currency analyst at Deutsche
Bank. ""The price action suggests that both the euro and the
Aussie's rally in the past few sessions have a bit to run.""
 Data on Tuesday showed a surprisingly large fall in an index
of German investor sentiment, while U.S. home builder sentiment
fell in June by the sharpest amount since the height of the
financial crisis. [ID:nN15218145].
 But investors set aside those numbers, prefering to look on
the bright side after Spain raised 5.2 billion euros at auctions
for 12- and 18-month bills. Belgium netted 2.5 billion euros in
an oversubscribed auction of its own.
 For details, see [ID:nLDE65E0TL], [ID:nLDE65E0WQ]
[ID:nWLA6316], and [ID:nTAR001853].
 As a result, the U.S. dollar and the yen  stayed under
some pressure. Both currencies are favoured when risk aversion
and volatility spikes. Euro/yen  was marginally lower at
112.60 yen, having jumped nearly 0.9 percent in the previous
session.
 The dollar index <.DXY> <=USD> was at 86.10, hovering above
support near the 85.85 area which is the index May 28 low. The
dollar  was steady at 91.44 yen, after slipping about 0.1
percent on Tuesday.
 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar  held onto broad
gains, trading at $0.8640, not far from its one-month high of
$0.8666 struck on Monday.

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro hit a two-week high
above $1.23 on Tuesday as solid demand at European debt
auctions eased worries about the region's fiscal crisis and

 The Swiss franc  jumped more than 1 percent to a

market feels that the worst for the euro has been priced in for

reasons to short the euro.""
 CORRECTIVE MOVE?
 Traders said central bank bids have helped keep the euro
above $1.20 over the last few trading sessions.
 By rising above $1.2342 on Tuesday, the euro surpassed the
38 percent retracement of a sharp decline that began at $1.3094
in early May and bottomed out at $1.1876 last week.
 Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Win Thin said that could
presage a move to $1.2485. But he also said the euro may find
it tough to go much further in the near future.
 ""Given that the root problem of insolvency remains in place
for several euro zone countries, we continue to view this euro
rally as a corrective move before the next move down,"" he
said.

 * Prices prone to volatility, energy an increasing factor
 * FAO says farm investment needs to reach poor countries
 
 (Updates with Gurria, Diouf quotes, farm-sector investment)
 By Gus Trompiz
 ROME, June 15 (Reuters) - Economic recovery and rising
energy costs will lift world agricultural prices in the next
decade, but prices will fall short of peaks in 2007-2008, the
UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation and OECD said on Tuesday.
 ""Let's say it's now moving at a more cruising speed,""
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
Secretary-General Angel Gurria said of the outlook for prices.
 The price rises would be positive, he said, as it would
encourage investments needed to meet rising food demand and cut
global hunger.
 ""You do need a certain expectation of stability and
improvement in real prices over time to attract investments,""
Gurria told Reuters following a presentation of the OECD-FAO
Agricultural Outlook 2010-2019.
 A surge in food prices in 2007-2008 sparked riots in
developing nations, drove commodity markets to record highs and
prompted export bans that roiled the flow of world trade. But
the global economic downturn and increased production pushed
grain prices from their peaks.
 FAO and OECD officials were cautious about their latest
price projections, saying agriculture would remain prone to
volatility, particularly due to the growing influence of energy
markets.
 Prices of crop and livestock products, with the exception of
pork, were all expected to rise in the coming decade compared
with 1997-2006. Wheat and coarse grains were expected to be
15-40 percent higher and vegetable oils up more than 40 percent.
 Average prices of dairy products were forecast to grow 16-45
percent, with the outlook improving markedly since a recovery in
the market in late 2009.
 In their previous 10-year outlook published a year ago while
the global economy was still limping, the organisations forecast
crop prices would rise 10-20 percent in real terms versus
1997-2006, dairy prices would be slightly higher and meat prices
would not exceed the base period.
 Although agricultural prices in 2010-19 will be higher than
in the decade before the 2007-08 surge, most prices were not
forecast to rise rapidly between now and 2019 as increased
supplies would restrain prices, a trend FAO has stressed in its
short-term crop forecasts.
 
 INPUT COSTS
 Rising crude oil, seen at over $96 a barrel in 2019, would
support agricultural prices by raising input costs and boosting
markets for biofuels that use crops, the new report said.
 Biofuels would also be helped by government blending
targets, the FAO and OECD said, putting ethanol output at 159
billion litres in 2019, up 110 percent from a 2007-09 average.
 Although trailing demand growth, increases in agricultural
output would still be sufficient to maintain sizeable stock
levels and to keep overall production on track to meet an
estimated 70 percent rise in global food output needed by 2050
to supply an increasing global population, the report said.
 Production gains would be driven by emerging countries.
Brazil would be the fastest-growing farm producer in 2010-19
with an increase of over 40 percent, followed by Ukraine at 29
percent and Russia at 26 percent.
 But FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf warned output growth
in poorer countries continued to lag richer nations and leading
emerging economies, calling on countries to fulfil pledges to
invest in small-scale farming in poor countries.
 ""We need to move from words to action,"" he told a joint
presentation with Angel Gurria.
 The world's richest nations have promised to invest some $20
billion in poor-country agriculture and Diouf said lengthy
discussions with donors had now clarified who would pay what.
The investments are also seen as a way of reducing the
number of hungry people in the world, which FAO says rose to 1
billion last year.

(Adds comment, updates prices)
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro rallied to a
two-week high against the dollar on Tuesday as solid demand at
European debt auctions soothed worries about the debt crisis
and prompted investors to cover short positions in the single
currency on increased risk appetite.
 Gains in the euro were limited, however, after economic
think-tank's ZEW German investor sentiment index fell far more
than expected in June, stirring some concerns about the euro
zone's economic outlook.
 Spain raised 5.2 billion euros at its 12- and 18-month
T-bill auctions on Tuesday, while Belgium raised 2.5 billion
euros in a heavily oversubscribed auction, and Ireland sold 1.5
billion in bonds.
 ""The refundings went better than expected, or at least they
can get their business done without having to be exorbitantly
expensive. I think that's really important,"" said Andrew Busch,
global currency and public policy strategist at BMO Capital
Markets in Chicago.
 ""We have run the cycle of downtrend pressure on the euro
for the time being,"" he added.
 In midday New York trading, the euro was up 0.9 percent at
$1.2330, after rising as high as $1.2344 on electronic trading
platform EBS, the strongest level since June 1.
 The euro closed on Monday above its 14-day moving average
for the first time since mid-April.
 Analysts said euro short positions were very stretched,
with traders taking profits on current positions without taking
on new shorts.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed
speculators had boosted their bets against the euro in the week
ended June 8, with net short positions just below record
levels.
 ""I think essentially we're at a point right now where the
market feels that the worst for the euro has been priced in for
the time being,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency
research at GFT in New York. ""We have sort of run out of fresh
reasons to short the euro.""
 CORRECTIVE MOVE?
 The euro has stayed above $1.20, well off its recent
four-year low around $1.1876, and traders said central bank
bids around $1.2170 helped put a lid on losses. Technical
analysts cited $1.2045 to $1.2170 as a support area.
 Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman in New York, said a break of $1.2342 could see
euro/dollar move toward $1.2485. The $1.2342 mark is the 38
percent retracement between the pair's post-European
Stabilization Plan high of $1.3094 reached in early May and the
low around $1.1876 hit last week.
 ""Despite the ongoing euro rally, we have not even hit the
minimal retracement target yet of that big move,"" Thin said in
a note. ""Given that the root problem of insolvency remains in
place for several euro zone countries, we continue to view this
euro rally as a corrective move before the next move down.""
 Against the yen, the euro was up 0.6 percent at 112.48 yen.
The dollar lost 0.3 percent to 91.24 yen.
 Analysts said concerns about the euro zone will likely
remain after Moody's on Monday downgraded Greece's rating to
junk status and Spanish Treasury Secretary Carlos Ocana said
some Spanish lenders faced a liquidity freeze in the interbank
market.
 Greek government bonds will attract an extra 5 percent
penalty when banks use them as security for European Central
Bank funds, an ECB spokesman said on Tuesday.

 By Walter Brandimarte and Simon Falush
 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Stocks, commodities
and the euro gained on Tuesday after successful sales of
government bonds by some of the weakest members of the euro
zone eased worries about the ability of debt-ridden European
countries to obtain market financing.
 U.S. stocks rose about 1 percent as the euro -- which has
become a yardstick for equity investors to gauge risk appetite
-- rose above $1.23 to its strongest level since June 3.
 European shares also rose as strong demand for Irish and
Spanish government debt offset jitters about Greece's fiscal
health, a day after Moody's downgraded Greece's debt rating to
junk status.
 Belgium also held a successful bond auction on Tuesday.
 Yields paid at the auctions, however, were still sharply
higher than a month ago, with investors still on edge after the
Moody's downgrade of Greece.
 ""The more the market starts to see that the credit markets
are beginning to return to normalcy, the better it becomes for
the euro,"" said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency
research at GFT in New York.
 The single European currency  rose as high as
$1.2305, according to the electronic trading platform EBS. It
remained 0.69 percent up at $1.2301 later.
 Stocks rose across the board as investors felt safer to
take in risk, despite disappointing economic data in the United
States and Germany.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 97.72 points,
or 0.96 percent, to 10,288.61, while the Standard & Poor's 500
Index <.SPX> gained 10.95 points, or 1.0 percent, to 1,100.58.
The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 28.83 points, or 1.28
percent, at 2,272.79.
 Industrial and technology sectors, which have high exposure
to Europe, led the U.S. advance. Planemaker Boeing Co  up
rose 3 percent to $66.78, while Caterpillar Inc  added 2
percent to $62.17.
 The move is ""all related to the euro. It determines how the
stock market behaves,"" said Joseph Battipaglia, market
strategist at Stifel Nicolaus in Yardley, Pennsylvania.
 Gains were just modestly trimmed after a report showed U.S.
homebuilder sentiment fell in June by the sharpest amount since
the height of the financial crisis.
 In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of top
shares climbed 0.8 percent, gaining ground for the fifth
consecutive session as more cyclical sectors like banks <.SX7P>
put on a strong performance.
 European stocks largely ignored a slump in a closely
watched indicator of German investor sentiment. The ZEW
economic think-tank's indicator fell in June at its fastest
rate since 2008, hit by concerns over the European debt woes.
[ID:nLDE65E0XT]
 World stocks <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.9 percent, up for a
sixth day, while emerging market stocks <.MSCIEF> gained 0.6
percent, according to benchmark MSCI indexes.
 U.S. Treasuries prices were just modestly up in thin
trading as demand for the safe-haven assets eased. The
benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was up 3/32,
with the yield at 3.2492 percent.
 Crude oil prices rose, supported by forecasts of reduced
crude stockpiles in the United States, though the market
remained wary after the Greek rating downgrade.
 U.S. crude oil  rose $1.20, or 1.6 percent, to $76.32

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2010 11:55AM ET</span>",UPDATE 1-Forced index fund sales of Greek debt likely," * More than 30 bln euros of Greek debt could be sold
 * BarCap, Citi to drop GGBs from index products from July 1
 * GGBs worth 200 bln eur included in BarCap index
 
 By George Matlock
 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Investors could be forced to
sell billions of euros of Greek government bonds after Barclays
Capital and Citigroup strip GGBs from indices following Moody's
downgrade of the sovereign credit to junk status.
 Moody's Investors Service cut Greece by four notches to junk
status on Monday.
 ""Greece government debt will thus exit all Series-L
investment-grade benchmarks (for example Global Aggregate,
Global Treasury, Euro Aggregate, and Euro Treasury) on July 1,
2010,"" investment bank BarCap said in its statement on Monday.
 It follows moves by Citigroup to drop GGBs from its World
Government Bond Index (WGBI), another key sovereign credit
benchmark series, after the Moody's downgrade.
 But estimates vary wildly as to how much debt will be dumped
by investors at the end of the month, and there is uncertainty
as to the impact on Greek government debt prices.
 ""The four-notch ratings cut on Greece by Moody's takes GGBs
out of most index-tracking funds. We estimate that total forced
selling in GGBs could amount to some 30 billion euros,"" said
Harvinder Sian, a bond analyst at RBS in London.
 Huw Worthington, a bond strategist at BarCap in London, said
a more conservative 2-4 billion euros may be involved as
investors shun Greek paper no longer seen as investment grade.
 Confusion reigns because of the many ways in which fund
managers apply the indices to their portfolios. This in turn
will make it harder to gauge how much or little the European
Central Bank may need to buy in its efforts to maintain stable
Greek bond yield spreads in the euro zone. The spread has
meandered at around 500-600 basis points over Bunds since the
ECB's operations began on May 10.
 Around 200 billion euros worth of Greek government bonds are
eligible for the BarCap and Citigroup indices, although not all
of them are actually in indices.
 ""The exact amount is difficult to estimate. According to the
Greek debt office, some 33 percent of GGBs have been allocated
to fund managers and insurance and pension funds between 2005
and 2009,"" said Christoph Rieger, a bond strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
 ""Applied to the indices, this would add up to 66 billion
euros. We believe the number that could actually be affected
will be much smaller though as these accounts are likely to have
reduced their holdings already significantly of late,"" he added.
 
 ACTIVE MANAGERS ALSO USE INDICES
 Not all fund managers have a licence to track the indices
tick-for-tick.
 ""Many funds just benchmark to an index for the purposes of
reporting to clients and are otherwise mostly or completely
active fund managers who pick and drop bonds as and when they
like. They are the ones who probably sold Greek bonds last
autumn when the debt troubles first emerged,"" said one index
specialist.
 Another problem is that even pure ""passive"" fund managers,
who track an index, are not obliged to hold every bond.
 ""There are instances where they can track the broad
benchmark returns without actually holding some countries' debt
throughout the investment period being measured,"" he added.
 Citigroup said on Monday GGBs would be removed at the end of
June after its index components are fixed on June 24 and said
Greek bonds account for 1.34 percent of its flagship WGBI. The
market value of Greek bonds is $213.6 billion.
 JP Morgan Chase, which runs a rival bond index series, said
in a note dated June 15 that GGBs were now eligible for its
Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus.
 Along with Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase, Barclays is one of
the world's major index product providers. The indices are used
by clients who want to maintain exposure to government debt
without the need to actively manage their portfolio.

 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, June 15 (Reuters) - Spain's and Portugal's fiscal
tightening plans this year and next are appropriately ambitious
but both countries should spell out in more detail austerity
steps planned for 2011, the European Commission said on
Tuesday.
 Apart from Spain and Portugal, in focus because of
financial market concerns about their ability to service debt,
the European Union's executive Commission approved progress in
fiscal consolidation also in 10 other EU countries.
 It started disciplinary steps against three more -- Cyprus,
Denmark and Finland -- for an expected breach of the 27-nation
EU's rule that budget deficits must not exceed 3 percent of
gross domestic product.
 The Commission proposed that Finland bring its deficit
below 3 percent next year, Cyprus in 2012 and Denmark in 2013.
 Luxembourg and Bulgaria are now the only EU countries not
in breach of the bloc's budget rules.
 The Commission assessed the progress of fiscal
consolidation in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia,
Slovenia and Spain, as required by EU finance ministers.
 ""In all cases we conclude that the measures taken were
sufficient to achieve the 2010 targets and, in most cases,
there is an invitation to specify as soon as possible measures
to substantiate the targets for the years beyond 2010,"" the
Commission said in a statement.
 Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told a
news conference in the French city of Strasbourg that Spanish
and Portuguese fiscal consolidation plans announced so far were
appropriately ambitious for this year and next.
 But part of the announced tightening remained to be
specified in detail, he said.
 In response, Spanish Economy Secretary Jose Manuel Campa
told Reuters Madrid awaited regional government spending cuts
to clarify its 2011 austerity measures. For more see
[ID:nLDE65E241].
 DETAILS LACKING
 Rehn said Portugal had to specify in more detail measures
worth 1.5 percent of GDP out of the planned total of 2.6
percent for 2011. Spain should substantiate its plans for cuts
worth 1.75 percent of GDP out of the announced 3.3 percent
total.
 ""This assessment should be considered as early guidance for
next year's budget. Overall, the current budgetary targets,
including recent revisions appear to ensure an appropriate
fiscal stance globally,"" Rehn said.
 Portugal's finance ministry reiterated in a statement that
in the 2011 budget, the country ""will take all the necessary
measures to ensure that the planned deficit level is reached,
with a view to allow the debt ratio to enter a declining trend
starting in 2012,"" but would not elaborate on details.
 Under pressure from markets, where the cost of borrowing
has been rising sharply for Madrid and Lisbon, Spain announced
on May 12 additional deficit-cutting steps under which it aims
to bring the budget shortfall to 9.3 percent of GDP this year
and to 6 percent in 2011 from 11.2 percent in 2009.
 Portugal announced on May 8 additional deficit-reduction
measures, including tax hikes, that aim to curb the shortfall
to 7.3 percent of GDP this year, rather than the previously
planned 8.3 percent, from 9.4 percent in 2009.
 For 2011, Portugal plans to reduce the deficit to 4.6
percent.
 Rehn reiterated the Commission's view that EU economic
growth would solidify towards the year-end, totalling around 1
percent in 2010, and accelerate to about 1.75 percent in 2011.

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Tuesday as
solid demand at European debt auctions soothed worries about
the debt crisis, prompting investors to cover short positions
in the single currency on increased risk appetite.
 Gains in the euro were limited, however, after a German
investor sentiment index fell much more than expected in June,
which stirred some concerns about the euro zone's economic
outlook. For details, see [ID:nLDE65E0TL]

 ""The more the market starts to see that the credit markets

 In early New York trading, the euro was up 0.5 percent at
$1.2281 , after rising as high as $1.2305 on electronic
trading platform EBS, the strongest level since June 3.
 The euro closed on Monday above its 14 day moving average
for the first time since mid-April.
 Analysts said euro short positions were very stretched,
with traders taking profits on current positions without taking
on new shorts.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed
speculators boosted their bets against the euro in the week
ended June 8, with net short positions just below record
levels. [IMM/FX]
 ""I think essentially we're at a point right now where the
market feels that the worst for the euro has been priced in for

 The euro has stayed above $1.20, well off its recent
four-year low around $1.1876 and traders said central bank bids
around $1.2170 helped put a lid on losses. Technical analysts
said $1.2045 should provide solid support for the euro.
 Against the yen, the euro  was up 0.3 percent at
112.15 yen. The dollar lost 0.3 percent to 91.25 yen .
 Gains in U.S. stocks also helped lift investors' appetite
for risk and boost the euro.

the euro are likely to persist after Spanish Treasury Secretary
Carlos Ocana said on Monday that some Spanish lenders faced a

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Foreign investors reduced
purchases of long-term U.S. securities in April but remained
net buyers, while China raised its U.S. Treasury holdings for a
second straight month, the Treasury Department said Tuesday.
 Net long-term foreign purchases fell to $83 billion,
compared with a record $140.5 billion in March. April's total
was still the second highest in 2010.
 Overseas investors had a healthy appetite for all manner of
U.S. assets, with Treasuries, U.S. corporate bonds, equities
and agency debt all attracting net inflows.
 China remained the biggest single holder of Treasury debt,
with $900.2 billion in its coffers as of April, up from $895.2
billion in March. Japan, the second largest Treasury holder,
raised holdings to $795.5 billion from $784.9 billion.
 Worries about a European debt crisis burnished the appeal
of dollar-denominated assets, analysts said.
 ""This is a strong report, and global investors are clearly
choosing to overweight their U.S. holdings given deterioration
in Europe and the fact that the U.S. economy is going to
recover at a faster pace than Europe,"" said Michael Woolfolk,
senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.
 While net long-term purchases fell compared to March,
buying of agency and corporate bonds remained well above levels
seen earlier this year and in late 2009, when both suffered
sizable monthly net selling.
 Overall net inflows, which include short-term securities
such as Treasury bills, amounted to $15 billion in April, while
March's tally was revised upward to $26 billion from an initial
estimate of $10.5 billion.
 Foreigners in late 2009 and early this year had been
trimming holdings of short-term instruments. Inflows into
short-dated securities ""is good news for the dollar,"" Woolfolk
said.
 China saw its stash of Treasury bills and other short-term
debt rise to $42 billion in April. The country had in recent
months been a net seller in this category as it let bills and
other short-term holdings mature.
 Elsewhere, the UK saw a surge in overall Treasury holdings
to $321.2 billion in April from $279 billion in March.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2010 08:39AM ET</span>","Economic upturn, energy to lift farm prices-FAO/OECD"," ROME, June 15 (Reuters) - Agricultural prices in 2010-19
will be mostly higher than in the decade preceding a spike in
2007-08, bolstered by an economic recovery and rising energy
prices, the FAO and OECD said in a report on Tuesday.
 Prices of major farm products should fall well short of
peaks seen since 2007 as supply generally becomes less tight,
but will be underpinned by growing demand and energy-related
costs, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation and
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.
 Crop and livestock products, with the exception of pork,
were all expected to show higher real prices in the coming
decade versus 1997-2006, with wheat and coarse grains seen 15-40
percent higher and vegetable oils up more than 40 percent.
 Dairy products were forecast to show real growth of 16-45
percent in average prices, with the outlook having improved
markedly since a recovery in the market in late 2009.
 ""Stronger demand, with an anticipated return to higher
growth following economic recovery and from increasing
populations, should outpace production growth, on average, over
the projection period to maintain all commodity prices on a
higher plateau,"" FAO and OECD said in their joint Agricultural
Outlook 2010-2019 report.
 In their previous 10-year outlook published a year ago in
the depths of the global economic downturn, the organisations
had forecast crop prices would rise 10-20 percent in real terms
versus 1997-2006, dairy prices would be slightly higher and meat
prices would not exceed the base period.
 Rising crude oil, seen at over $96 a barrel in 2019, would
support agricultural prices by raising input costs and boosting
markets for biofuels that use crops, the new report said.
 But while outstripping prices in the decade before the
2007-08 surge, most agricultural prices were not forecast to
rise significantly by 2019 compared with current levels as
increased production would boost supplies, a trend FAO has
stressed in its short-term crop forecasts.
 
 BRAZIL DRIVES FARM OUTPUT
 Although trailing demand growth, increases in agricultural
output would still be sufficient to maintain sizeable stock
levels and to keep overall production on track to meet an
estimated 70 percent rise in global food output needed by 2050
to supply a swelling global population, the report said.
Production gains would be driven by emerging countries.
Brazil would be the fastest-growing farm producer in 2010-19
with an increase of over 40 percent, while Ukraine (29 percent)
and Russia (26 percent) would also see high growth.
 But a shift in production towards countries with more
erratic crop yields could contribute to price volatility, along
with the increasing influence of energy prices on agriculture,
the report said. Emerging countries would also claim a
greater share of consumption and trade in agricultural
commodities, although they would remain dwarfed by the world's
richest economies in exports in dairy products and non-rice
grains.
 Biofuels should also drive demand and prices for major crops
in coming years, with government targets and a recovery in
energy prices encouraging more growth of the alternative fuels,
FAO and OECD said, forecasting ethanol output would reach 159
billion litres in 2019, up 110 percent from a 2007-09 average.
 By 2019, almost 35 percent of sugarcane and 13 percent of
coarse grains production worldwide will go towards ethanol, up
from about 20 and 9 percent in 2007-09, while the share of
vegetable oil output going to biodiesel would rise to 16 percent
from 9 percent, the report said.
 But the outlook for biofuel markets was uncertain given
fluctuating crude oil prices, evolving public policy and the
prospect of second-generation biofuels, it added.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2010 08:35AM ET</span>",US May import prices post largest drop in 10 months," WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. import prices recorded
their largest decline in nearly a year in May as petroleum
costs plummeted, according to a government report on Tuesday
that bolstered views of tame inflation and low interest rates.
 Import prices fell 0.6 percent, the biggest decline since
July, after rising by a revised 1.1 percent in April, the Labor
Department said.
 Although the decline was less than economists' expectations
for a 1.2 percent fall, it was the first drop since February.
April import prices were previously reported to have increased
0.9 percent. In the 12 months to May, import prices rose 8.6
percent.
 The monthly decline in import prices reflected a 5.0
percent fall in the cost of imported petroleum and petroleum
products, the largest drop since December 2008, after a 3.7
percent gain in April.
 Excluding petroleum, import prices rose 0.5 percent after
rising by the same margin in April.
 Strength in the U.S. dollar is also helping to keep
inflation pressures muted and this should allow the Federal
Reserve to renew its low interest rate pledge at next week's
policy meeting to nurse the economy's recovery.
 The Labor Department report showed export prices
unexpectedly increased 0.7 percent last month after rising 1.2
percent in April. Analysts had expected export prices to be
flat in May. In the 12 months to March, export prices rose 5.8
percent.

 * Equity investors exiting energy after BP spill
 * Net 27 percent see weaker growth in China
 
 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Investors have become less
bullish about the global economy but have not given up on
riskier assets, finding equities as cheap as they have been
since March 2009, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch poll showed on
Tuesday.
 The investment bank also concluded that fears over the euro
currency have peaked and that BP's  oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico has prompted equity investors to chase dividend
payouts in sectors other than energy.
 BofA-Merrill said the main finding in its June survey of 207
global fund managers was that investors had become cautious on
economic growth but that sentiment towards riskier assets such
as equities has not overly suffered.
 ""Risk appetite has stabilised,"" said Gary Baker, head of
European equity strategy. ""You haven't really seen any panic
from investors.""
 A net 24 percent of respondents expected global growth to
strengthen over the next 12 months compared with 42 percent in
May and 61 percent in April.
 ""That is quite a major reversal in terms of expectations,""
Baker said.
 A net 27 percent of respondents now expect weaker growth in
China over the next 12 months, the most pessimistic reading
since January 2009. This could, however, prove a positive as it
suggests fears of Chinese overheating may be waning.
 The less bullish growth sentiment was matched by more
positive attitudes towards riskier assets.
 Respondents said equities were now cheaper than they have
been since March 2009, with emerging market stocks seen as the
most favoured sector.
 Cash levels slipped to 4.1 percent of portfolios from 4.3
percent in May, both below the 4.5 percent level BofA-Merrill
considers a buy signal.
 The investment banks said the overall tone of the June
survey suggested that ""a simple absence of negative surprises on
macro-data would be equity positive.""
 In other words, conditions are ripe for investors to boost
stocks again unless there is unexpectedly poor economic news.
 
 OIL AND EURO
 The month's survey also showed that this year's fall in the
euro may be close to bringing the currency down to what
investors see as a fair value.
 Only a net 14 percent said the euro was still overvalued,
down from 45 percent a month earlier. Views on the dollar,
meanwhile, were neutral.
 The survey also found that the Gulf oil spill had
contributed to a sharp pullback in exposure to energy stocks.
 Only a net 7 percent were overweight compared with a net 37
percent in May.
 The main beneficiaries were ""dividend friendly"" utilities,
telecoms and pharmaceuticals, Baker said.

 * Says many of Greece's problems are specific to Greece
 * Markets likely to keep testing bloc's commitment to euro
 
 FRANKFURT, June 15 (Reuters) - Financial markets have
overreacted to the euro area's sovereign debt problems, though
they are likely to keep testing the region's commitment to the
single currency, credit rating agency Fitch said.
 ""The knock-on has gone a bit too far,"" Fitch sovereign
credit analyst Brian Coulton said of the crisis that has spread
from Greece to other euro zone periphery countries and raised
questions about the viability of the currency bloc.
 Portugal, Spain, Ireland and even Italy have been swept
along with market fears about surging deficit and debt levels.
But they are in qualitatively different position to Greece,
having already taken tough policy decisions in response to the
crisis, Coulton said.
 ""A lot of problems in Greece are specific to Greece,""
Coulton told reporters on the sidelines of a financial
conference.
 Many euro area politicians, particularly those from the
southern European states worst affected by the market ructions,
have blamed credit rating agencies for contributing to the
sovereign crisis with downgrades that appeared to ignore
government and international efforts to bring state finances
back into line.
 Fitch currently rates Greece at BBB-, the lowest
investment-grade level, with a negative outlook, which implies
more than 50 percent possibility of a downgrade.
 It has no plans to cut Greece's debt to non-investment grade
in the immediate future, it said on Monday, after Moody's cut
Greek sovereign debt to junk status. [ID:LDE65D29L]
 Fitch also has a negative outlook on Portugal but mainly due
to worries over the economic outlook rather than policy, Coulton
said. Ireland and Spain have stable outlooks.
 Financial markets were likely to continue testing
policymakers' commitment to the euro bloc as long as residual
doubts remained, Coulton said, adding that the European Central
Bank ought to be more active in attenuating the crisis.
 The crisis was largely a question of the market's perception
of the political coherence of the bloc, since the debt was
internal to the euro area.
 ""There could be further volatility,"" Coulton said, adding
that he considered the risk of a break-up of the euro area in
the short to medium term to be remote.
 Government debt levels have jumped sharply in response to
the financial crisis and Coulton said a return to lower debt
levels was ""off the agenda"" even in the long term, with
countries struggling now just to get deficits under control.
 Asked when euro government debt levels might revisit their
pre-crisis levels, Coulton, 43, said: ""Perhaps when my children
get close to retirement"".

 By Padraic Halpin and Marie-Louise Gumuchian
 DUBLIN, June 15 (Reuters) - Ireland said it would press on
for now with its regular monthly bond auctions after selling 1.5
billion euros of debt on Tuesday amid strong demand as investors
attracted by higher yields sought value on the euro zone
periphery.
 The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), which has
covered more than 80 percent of its fundraising goal for 2010,
sold 750 million euros of paper maturing in 2016 and 750 million
of debt due in 2018.
 The debt agency, which had aimed to raise between 1 billion
and 1.5 billion euros from the tenders, continued a run of
successful syndicated sales and monthly auctions held against a
backdrop of market turmoil.
 Bid-to-cover rates were 3.06 and 2.87 respectively,
indicating high demand.
 The auction ""looks to have found bargain hunting demand, and
should further bolster risk sentiment"" towards euro zone debt,
said Credit Agricole rate strategist Peter Chatwell.
 But yields rose after a Moody's downgrade of Greece late on
Monday refocused investor attention on sovereign debt servicing
on the euro zone periphery.
 The average yield on the 2016 bond rose to 4.521 percent
from 3.663 percent from the last comparable auction in April and
the 2018 bond to 5.088 percent from the 4.55 percent paid last
August.
 ""We're going to remain under (yield) pressure unfortunately,
even though our fundamentals are improving and we have led the
way in terms of fiscal austerity,"" Alan McQuaid, chief economist
at Bloxham Stockbrokers said.
 ""We are being tarred with the same brush as others and I
don't think that's going to change any time soon.""
 The NTMA said it was satisfied with demand levels at the
auctions in the ""very difficult market conditions"", and that
Ireland was in a strong funding position.
 ""Allowing for other cash balances the Exchequer is fully
funded through end-2010. The NTMA will continue for the time
being its regular series of monthly bond auctions.""
 The next auction is scheduled for 20 July.
 
 WIDER SPREADS
 Like other peripheral euro zone countries, Ireland's bond
yield spreads widened after the Moody's downgrade of Greece into
junk territory. The agency cited risks in the euro zone/IMF
rescue package for the debt-laden country. [ID:nLDE65E09O]
 The premium investors demand to hold 10-year Irish bonds
over benchmark German Bunds stood at around 292 bps on Tuesday,
above the 190 bps level of the last auction in May and rising
from Monday's 265 bps.
 Ireland passed its first test after euro zone central banks
started buying back bonds to support the market last month,
hitting the top of its target range in May's auction by selling
1.5 billion euros at only marginally higher costs than before.
[ID:nLDE64H0YU]
 The NTMA had considered skipping that auction due to rising
yields, and analysts said the debt agency would try to keep the
monthly auctions on schedule as more Irish banks follow Bank of
Ireland  in launching rights issues. [ID:nLDE657147]
 ""The NTMA could have skipped (Tuesday's) auction if they
wanted to but it's really not about the sovereign at this
juncture, it's more about getting out the right signal for the
markets to leave the door open for domestic banks to raise
required funds,"" McQuaid said.
 ""Sorting out the banks' funding is the main game in town.""

adopting the euro has jumped by almost half since February
although a majority are still in favour, according to a poll
published on Tuesday following months of turmoil in the euro
zone's periphery.
 The proportion against euro entry jumped to 32.7 percent
from 22.4 percent four months earlier, according to the poll
carried out in the second half of May by Median for newspaper
Lidove Noviny.
 The Czech Republic, which joined the European Union in 2004,
has dropped a target of 2010 for adopting the euro.
 But skepticism about the benefits of joining the single
currency has risen along with concern about the public finances
of Greece and other weaker economies. 
 The poll showed the number of people who still wish to adopt
the European currency at some point fell to 54.2 percent from
63.8 percent in February.
 Many Czechs also fear euro entry would mean they would have
to help to pay to bail out other members, with the poll showing
81.5 percent against helping Greece.
 Centre-right politicians building a coalition cabinet after
election two weeks ago have long had a cautious view of the
timing for euro adoption.

 * Analysts see room for further eur/dlr short squeeze
 
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro turned higher on
Tuesday as solid demand at debt auctions eased concerns about
euro zone debt problems after Monday's downgrade of Greece to
junk status.
 The euro erased brief losses seen in the wake of a weak
German ZEW investor sentiment survey, which renewed concerns
about the negative effects of the euro zone debt crisis on the
wider economy.
 But analysts said the euro's falls had been unconvincing,
with solid demand at auctions in Spain, Ireland and Belgium
enough to push it back up.
 ""There is enough to stop people from aggressively selling
euro/dollar,"" said RBS currency strategist Paul Robson.
 ""S&P (ratings agency) had already downgraded Greece to junk,
so the Moody's news was less significant, and the ZEW survey was
weak but other survey data has been relatively good"".
 He said there was scope for a squeeze in euro short
positions up to around the $1.26 level.
 At 1027 GMT, the euro was up 0.3 percent to $1.2258, coming
off an earlier low of $1.2167. 
 This euro has stayed above $1.20, well off its recent
four-year low around $1.1876, with traders saying central bank
bids around $1.2170 were putting a lid on losses.
 Analysts said euro short positions were also very stretched,
with traders taking profits on current positions without taking
on new shorts.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed speculators
boosted their bets against the euro in the week ended June 8,
with net short positions just below record levels. 
 SEB technical analysts said $1.2045 should provide solid
support for the euro. That level is around the lows hit on
Friday before Monday's solid rally on Monday to close to $1.23.
 The euro closed on Monday above its 14 day moving average
for the first time since mid-April.

 SPAIN WORRIES
 Euro gains may be limited, however, with worries about
Spanish banks persisting after Spanish Treasury Secretary Carlos
Ocana acknowledged on Monday that some Spanish lenders faced a
liquidity freeze in the interbank market.
 ""The Greece downgrade highlighted that these problems are
quite severe and it is difficult to see the liquidity problems
in Spain improving and I think the euro will struggle going
forward,"" said Johan Javeus, currency strategist at SEB in
Stockholm.
 Moody's slashed Greece's rating by four notches, citing
""macroeconomic and implementation risks"" in the country's
draconian austerity programme and renewing doubts about Greece's
ability to repay its debt.
 This put a stop to the euro's impressive run over the past
few sessions when a rally in equity markets prompted investors
to take profits on hefty short positions, leading the single
currency to stall just shy of resistance at around $1.23.
 The euro erased earlier losses against the yen to turn 0.1
percent higher at 111.98 yen. The U.S. dollar lost 0.2 percent
to 91.40 yen.

(Adds CEO, analyst comments)
 PARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - Societe Generale set a net profit
goal of 6 billion euros ($8.05 billion) for 2012 on Tuesday,
double its target for this year, as the bank seeks to restore
investor confidence in a tough business environment.
 Chief executive Frederic Oudea also told reporters the bank
would not seek a capital increase and would finance acquisitions
by selling off chunks of its asset portfolio as part of a
broader five-year plan.
 ""We will arbitrage the portfolio ... There will be sales,
there will be acquisitions,"" said Oudea ahead of an investor day
designed to present long-term targets as the bank struggles to
lift its share price from 11-month lows.
 Oudea added that the price of Allied Irish Bank's stake in
Polish bank Zachodni, which SocGen has been linked to, seemed
""too expensive"" relative to its growth potential.
 SocGen shares were 0.4 percent higher at 35.185 euros by
0830 GMT, outperforming a 0.6 percent drop on the STOXX Europe
600 banks index.
 SocGen said in a statement, which comes during the second
week of the trial of former trader Jerome Kerviel, that
second-quarter trading was strong so far for its French retail
network but mixed for the equities division at its investment
bank because of volatile market conditions.
 Oudea refused to give more details, saying only that the
group was sticking to its annual targets for 2010.
 ""The second quarter is not over,"" he told reporters.
 
 BROAD TARGETS
 Societe Generale's earnings target is part of a five-year
plan that it said will involve restructuring its Russian
business, cutting costs and sealing acquisitions to boost
profits against a backdrop of economic sluggishness in Europe.
 It also said it was targeting for 2012 an increase in return
on equity after tax to 14 to 15 percent, a core Tier 1 capital
ratio above 8 percent, a cost-to-income ratio below 60 percent
and annual revenue growth between 2009 and 2012 of 4 percent.
 CEO Oudea is unveiling details of the plan to investors on
Tuesday. 
 ""The financial targets are not unrealistic, but still seem
optimistic in corporate and investment banking, and do not take
into account potential changes linked to Basel III (regulatory
measures),"" Oddo analyst Alain Dupuis wrote in a note.
 The bank's shares are trading at an 11-month low after
falling 28 percent so far this year, pressured by fears over
Europe's sovereign debt levels and toxic asset write-downs.
 SocGen confirmed on Tuesday it expected a pretax impact from
toxic assets in 2010 of 700 million to 1 billion euros.
 The group also said a new valuation by BlackRock showed
toxic assets at maturity would imply an overall gain of 1.5
billion euros before tax compared with the end of March.
 Oudea and his management team will present themselves to
investors as the right people for the job of navigating the
tough business environment. Some shareholders and analysts have
questioned their ability to guide the bank's strategy.
 Meanwhile, SocGen is also battling Kerviel in court over
risky bets that the bank blamed for 4.9 billion euros in losses
in early 2008.
 Kerviel, whose trial is due to run until June 25, risks five
years in prison and a 375,000 euro fine if found guilty of
charges of breach of trust, computer abuse and forgery.
 Oudea declined to comment directly on the trial on Tuesday
but said SocGen had responded at the time by tightening up its
risk controls.
 Oudea overhauled top management after his predecessor Daniel
Bouton stepped down in 2009, under attack over his leadership
and handling of the Kerviel affair.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2010 05:07AM ET</span>",Euro zone April trade surplus smaller than expected," BRUSSELS, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro zone had a
smaller-than-expected trade surplus in April, unadjusted data
showed on Tuesday, as exports surged year-on-year but marginally
less than imports.
 The 16-country area had an external trade surplus of 1.8
billion euros ($2.4 billion) as exports rose 18 percent
year-on-year and imports surged 19 percent, the European Union
statistics office said. March's surplus was 4.5 billion euros.
 In April 2009, the surplus was 2.6 billion euros.
 Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected a 3.7
billion euro unadjusted trade surplus for April this year.
 The sharp rise in exports is likely to point to a rebound in
global demand for euro zone goods. The increase in imports is
seen signalling higher domestic demand, boding well for economic
recovery. 
 Adjusted for seasonal swings, the trade surplus in April
totalled 1.4 billion euros as exports dropped 2.4 percent
month-on-month and imports fell 3.5 percent against March.

 TOKYO, June 15 (Reuters) - BNY Mellon Asset Management is
looking to expand its business into India, in the latest stage of
its plan to boost its presence in Asia, a co-head of the company
said on Tuesday.
 The move follows a tie-up with a Chinese asset manager and
the firm increasing its workforce in Japan by 40 percent in the
last two years.
 But BNY Mellon Asset, a unit of the world's top custodian,
Bank of New York Mellon, is not attracted to any European asset
firms that are currently for sale, said Jonathan Little, an
acting co-head of BNY Mellon Asset.
 BNY Mellon, which manages $1.1 trillion in assets, has
already made three acquisitions over the last 18 months, tying up
with London-based Insight Investment, as well as the asset
service units of PNC Financial and Germany's BHF Asset Servicing.
 The company is expected to receive regulatory approval in the
near term for its asset management joint venture with Western
Securities in China.
 ""The other market that we remain very interested in is India,
where we still do not have a significant presence,"" Little told a
a small group of reporters.
 Little, who is in Japan on a regular business trip, was
elevated to his new post last month after former head Ronald
O'Hanley was hired to run Boston-based Fidelity.
 The asset company aims to grow organically in Japan as many
asset managers in the country are part of larger financial
institutions, with their distribution and client bases already
bound together, while there are few major independent asset
managers, Little said.
 ""We don't see that there have been many opportunities in
Japan to buy an asset management company, but if the right
opportunity came up ... and if the price was attractive then we'd
look at it,"" he said.
 BNY Mellon Asset sees broad growth in Japan, including in
pension fund and investment trust fund businesses, Little
continued.
 ""We are expanding here (in Japan), hiring more staff
particularly to service retail distribution through banking
channels,"" Little said.
 The asset manager has been a net hirer in Japan over the past
two years, boosting its workforce to almost 70 staff from about
50.
 Investment Trusts Association data showed BNY Mellon Asset
Japan held 89.2 billion yen ($975 million) in assets under

 By Simon Falush
 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Stocks gained, commodity prices
rose and the euro clambered higher on Tuesday as strong demand
for debt from around Europe reassured investors about the state
of the euro zone's finances.
 Spain's Treasury raised 5.2 billion euros at its 12- and
18-month T-bill auction on Tuesday, while Belgium raised 2.5
billion euros in a heavily oversubscribed auction, and Ireland
sold 1.5 billion in bonds.
 That eased anxiety over the state of the euro zone's debt
situation, although the yields countries have to pay are still
sharply higher than a month ago and Moody's downgrade of Greece
to junk status on Monday had kept markets on edge.
 The euro briefly fell after the ZEW indicator showed German
investor sentiment slumped much more than expected in June, but
the move was quickly reversed as investors chose to focus on
more positive indicators.
 European shares were up for a fifth consecutive day, with
the FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.4 percent, with more cyclical sectors
like banks among the strongest performeers.
 ""S&P had already downgraded Greece to junk, so the Moody's
news was less significant, and the ZEW survey was weak but other
survey data has been relatively good,"" said RBS currency
strategist Paul Robson.
 
 DATA SHRUGGED OFF
 World stocks, gained 0.1 percent, up for a sixth day, while
MSCI's main emerging market stock index, which is up around 9
percent since hitting a year low on May 25, also added 0.1
percent.
 The euro, which was languishing at a low since 2006 of
$1.1876 last week, gained 0.4 percent to $1.22.63.
 ""There is enough to stop people from aggressively selling
euro/dollar, and what doesn't go down will tend to go up,""
Robson said.
 Miners and energy stocks were also firmer as base metals
like copper gained and crude rose to around $76 per barrel.
 U.S. Treasuries were softer as demand for the safe-haven
asset eased. T-notes futures fell 6/32 in price to 120-00/32,
but remained above its 10-day low around 119-7.5/32 hit in
Monday U.S. trade.
 While governments managed to raise funds by selling bonds,
lingering concerns kept investors relatively cautious.
 Moody's cited ""macroeconomic and implementation risks"" in
Greece's draconian austerity programme, reviving persistent
doubts about Athens' ability to repay its debt.
 Spanish Treasury Secretary Carlos Ocana admitted officially
for the first time on Monday that some Spanish banks were facing
a liquidity freeze in the interbank market.
 Others were also worried about the outlook for the economy
and its impact on stocks.
 ""What's important for the stock exchange is the profit
outlook for companies and that is related to economic growth. If
economic growth falters in the second half of this year then you
can cross-out that provision.""

 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro retreated on Tuesday as

sentiment and cutting short a rally in the currency.
 Moody's slashed Greece's rating by four notches, citing
""macroeconomic and implementation risks"" in the country's
draconian austerity programme and renewing persistent doubts
about Greece's ability to repay its debt.
 Worries about Spain also increased as Spanish Treasury
Secretary Carlos Ocana acknowledged on Monday that some Spanish
banks faced a liquidity freeze in the interbank market.
 This put a stop to the euro's impressive run over the past
few sessions when a rally in equity markets prompted investors
to take profits on hefty short positions, leading the single
currency to stall just shy of resistance at around $1.23.
 ""Yesterday we had concerns about Spain and on top of that
the Greece downgrade and that is weighing on the euro now,"" said
Johan Javeus, currency strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
 ""The Greece downgrade highlighted that these problems are
quite severe and it is difficult to see the liquidity problems
in Spain improving and I think the euro will struggle going
forward"".
 SEB technical analysts said, however, that $1.2045 should
provide solid support for the euro. That level is close to lows
hit on Friday before the currency's solid rally on Monday when
it rose close to $1.23.
 The euro on Monday closed above its 14 day moving average
for the first time since mid-April.
 At 0717 GMT, the euro was down 0.3 percent against the
dollar at $1.2182.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.7 percent to $0.8522, pulling
back from Monday's one-month high as greater risk aversion
caused investors to cut exposure to higher-yielding currencies.
 Minutes of an Australian central bank meeting that said
interest rates could be left on hold in the near term also hit
the Aussie. Policymakers expressed concerns about the debt
problems in the euro zone.
 
 STALLING RALLY
 Yield spreads between peripheral euro zone government bonds
and core German Bunds widened on Tuesday after the Greece
downgraded and traders said the market looked vulnerable to euro
negative news.
 ""Whether the bounce in the euro from $1.19 to $1.22 is more
than a brief relief bounce remains open for debate but the sharp
reaction to the rating downgrade overnight suggests that
sentiment is still extremely fragile,"" Matthew Strauss, senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital wrote in a note.
 Traders said any revival in risk appetite may check losses
in the near term, however.
 Resistance is still around a Fibonacci retracement level at
$1.2301, which is 23.6 percent of the euro's move from an April
14 high to its June 7 low.
 The euro fell 0.7 percent on the yen to 111.01 yen. The U.S.
dollar lost 0.4 percent to 91.16 yen.
 In the options market, the recent rebound in euro/yen and
Aussie/yen was reducing the attraction of yen calls and
prompting investors to dump options since euro/yen failed to
break below a barrier at 108 yen last week, traders said.

(Adds background, Stark quote)
 FRANKFURT, June 15 (Reuters) - European Central Bank
purchases of government bonds are not directed at bailing out
governments, ECB Executive Board Member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said
late on Monday.
 The ECB started buying sovereign bonds last month in a
controversial decision aimed at supporting bond markets, which
have been rattled by a loss of investor confidence in some
governments' ability to rein in debt and deficits.
 ""While central banks will be called upon to support market
functioning in liquidity crises when the integrity of the
transmission mechanism is threatened, they cannot be asked to
rescue insolvent issuers - whether private or public
institutions,"" Bini Smaghi said in a speech at a conference in
New York, published on the ECB's web site on Tuesday.
 ""In line with this principle, (the ECB's Securities Markets
Programme) is meant to repair the integrity of the transmission
mechanism, not to finance public debt.""
 Bond markets refocused on euro zone debt problems on Tuesday
after Moody's investors service slashed Greece's credit rating

 Euro zone central banks had settled 47 billion euros worth
of government bond purchases by last Friday, and the ECB will
hold a fine-tuning operation later on Tuesday to mop up a
similar amount in one-week deposits.
 Bini Smaghi said sovereign debt would probably replace
asset-backed securities as the main collateral for secured
loans.
 He said central banks, when laying out what kind of debt was
acceptable as collateral to them, had to be aware that this
might affect the price of the debt and hinted the ECB's
collateral rules might need to be fine-tuned further.
 ""This argues in favour of a graduated system of collateral
valuation, in which haircuts reflect the underlying fair value
along a common scale, possibly with less threshold discontinuity
than at present,"" he said.
 The ECB is set to publish details of changes to haircuts for
assets rated BBB+ to BBB- in July. [ID:nLDE6371LE]
 Meanwhile, in separate comments, fellow Executive Board
member Juergen Stark brushed off the chance of a double-dip
recession.
""There are no signs of a second downturn or a potential
second downturn,"" he told BBC Radio 4, according to Dow Jones
newswires.

 WARSAW, June 15 (Reuters) - Poland's new central bank
governor, Marek Belka, expects the zloty to strengthen, driven
by the recovering economy and its convergance with the European
Union, a newspaper on Tuesday quoted him as saying.
 Belka added a longer term weakness of the zloty could fuel
a rise in inflation, but remained optimistic that in near
future there were no risks that could fuel a rise in prices.
 ""All signs show that the zloty should strengthen,"" Belka
told Rzeczpospolita daily. ""For 20 years the zloty is in an
appreciation trend. It is a result of ongoing economic growth
and is a phenomenon tied to our convergence with developed
economies.""
 The zloty  has been weakening on the back of
investors' worries that Greece's debt crisis will spread to
other weaker European states.

replace Slawomir Skrzypek, who died in a plane crash in western
Russia along with the President Lech Kaczynski and many other

one to avoid recession during the global crisis and it has

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2010 01:03AM ET</span>",Citigroup poised to cut Greek debt from WGBI index," By Daniel Bases
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Citigroup said on Monday it
is preparing to remove Greek government debt from its World
Government Bond Index, a key benchmark for sovereign credit,
after Moody's Investors Service cut its rating to junk status.
 ""Greece no longer meets the minimum credit criteria of
BBB-/Baa3 by either S&P or Moody's for the World Government
Bond Index (WGBI),"" Citigroup said in a memo obtained by
Reuters.
 Moody's earlier on Monday cut Greek government bond ratings
four notches to Ba1 from A3, the second ratings agency to
regard the Hellenic Republic's credit as non-investment grade.
 In late April, Standard & Poor's cut its rating on Greece
to BB-plus, an equivalent junk status.
 ""If the credit ratings remain below investment-grade on
June 24, 2010, the fixing date for the July 2010 Profile,
Greece will be removed from the WGBI at the end of June,"" the
memo, dated June 14, said.
 Greece stands at the center of Europe's sovereign credit
crisis which roiled global financial markets and pushed the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund to cobble
together a massive bailout plan.
 The aid mechanism for Greece is worth 110 billion euros
($132.4 billion) and a safety net for other euro zone countries
is worth 500 billion euros.
 Greece has a debt load forecast to reach 149 percent of
gross domestic product by 2013. It is expected to see its
economy slump by 4 percent this year after a 2 percent drop in
2009, as tax increases and cuts in wages and pensions take a
toll.
 Citigroup said there are currently 23 Greek government
bonds in the ""June 2010 WGBI profile"" with a total market value
of $213.6 billion. These bonds represent 1.34 percent of the
overall WGBI, the memo said.
 The bonds would also be removed from the EMU Government
Bond Index (EGBI) and the World Broad Investment-Grade
(WorldBIG) Bond Index at the end of June, Citigroup said.
 ""We will continue to track the Greek Government Bond Index
as one of the WGBI - Additional Market Indexes starting with
the July 2010 profile,"" the memo said.
 The WGBI index is a major benchmark used by investment
funds. Once removed, a country can become a candidate for
re-entry if it meets requisite criteria. This process however
takes a minimum of six months.
 Separately, JPMorgan Chase said in a research note dated
June 15 that Greek sovereign debt, as a result of the Moody's
downgrade, were now eligible for its Emerging Markets Bond
Index Plus (EMBI+) <11EMJ><.JPMEMBIPLUS>.
 At present only the Greek 4.625 percent 2013 bonds
 are eligible for the EMBI+, however they
""don't meet the necessary liquidity criteria for inclusion,"" JP
Morgan said. The bond was last bid at a price of 82.167,
yielding 12.002 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 ""Greece is not eligible for the EMBIG/Diversified series
due to its high income status,"" the firm said.

 * Global recovery will be ""slow, tortuous""

 BEIJING, June 15 (Reuters) - The global economic recovery is
likely to be ""slow and tortuous"" and China faces risks from a
multitude of factors including trade protectionism and bad real
estate loans, China's Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said
on Tuesday.
 ""The chances in 2010 of some credit assets forming into
substantive risks and losses has increased,"" the CBRC said in
its annual report, published on its website on Tuesday.
 Among the risks faced by Chinese banks, it identified quite
large risks from ""unwise lending"" to local government investment
units, as well as the sovereign debt crisis and U.S. dollar
exchange rates.
 It said some banks were lending large amounts to local
governments units, noting ""risk management has been inadequate,
and there are quite large latent risks in lending to local
investment vehicles.""
 CBRC's chairman, Liu Mingkang, has repeatedly said the
regulator will strictly control the speed of lending and is
paying special attention to lending risks in the property
sector.
 The government has also warned of the dangers of China's
red-hot property market, which it has described as one of the
country's most pressing economic problems, and has tried to get
banks to rein in property lending.
 CBRC's annual report also warned of risks from ""imprudent
behaviour"" in personal housing loans in 2010.
 ""The risks from a chain reaction in lending for real estate
development may warrant attention, and latent credit risks may
be increasing,"" said the report, posted at
http://zhuanti.cbrc.gov.cn/subject/subject/nianbao2009/2009zwzz.pdf

lending and money supply growth slowed in May and new local

 By Umesh Desai
 HONG KONG, June 15 (Reuters) - Asia's stockmarket rally
paused on Tuesday and the euro sputtered after five days of
gains as it struggled to break through a resistance after a
downgrade of Greece's credit rating reminded investors that
Europe's debt crisis was not over.
 Although Moody's 4-notch downgrade of Greece's rating to
Ba1 had been expected, as it was catching up with rival
Standard & Poor's BB-plus rating, the move gave investors an
excuse to book profits after shares hit a month high on Monday.
[ID:nWNA3381]
 European shares were expected to fall at open with
Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> seen 0.6 percent lower, Germany's
DAX <.GDAXI> seen half a percent weaker, and France's CAC-40
<.FCHI> down by as much as 0.4 percent.
 ""Markets were expecting the downgrade but it does bring
attention back to the economic realities in Europe,"" said Mark
Konyn, who oversees about $11 billion as Asia-Pacific chief
executive of RCM, a unit of Allianz Global Investors.
 ""The worrying aspect is how they can create an apt balance
between managing the debt and implementing fiscal austerity
which will not threaten growth overtly.""
 The euro , which gained strongly in the last few
sessions, saw its rally losing steam with the single currency
failing to breach an important resistance on charts.
 Wall Street surrendered gains on Tuesday after the Greek
downgrade, ending little changed in low volume on lingering
worries that the euro zone's problems may hamper the global
economic recovery.
 Global stocks had rallied earlier on data showing euro zone
industrial output surged in April, achieving the biggest
year-on-year percentage gain in almost two decades.
[ID:nLDE65D0YC]
 RCM's Konyn said investors were seeing big risks in
investing in Europe and that was affecting risk appetite
generally.
 The Australian dollar pulled back further from a one-month
high versus the U.S. dollar as traders reduced demand for
higher-yielding currencies after minutes of an Australian

[ID:nSYC002333]
 In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei share average clawed back from its
initial fall to trade flat <.N225>, but stayed around its
25-day moving average, a psychological resistance level.
 The MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks
<.MIAPJ0000PUS> was down half a percent at 385.52 by 0645 GMT,
after falling as much as 0.6 percent. That halted a five day
winning streak, as sectors like resources <.MIAPJMT00PUS> and
energy <.MIAPJHC00PUS> weighed.
 The euro was at $1.2204 , down 0.1 percent from late
New York trade on Monday, retreating further from the previous
day's high of $1.2298 on trading platform EBS.
 It had gained 0.9 percent on Monday when it rose to as high
as $1.2298 and well above a four-year low of $1.1876 hit last
week.
 Much of the gains of late have been fuelled by traders
covering their short bets against the currency, but dealers
said the single currency was still vulnerable to any bearish
news from the euro zone.
 ""The euro would need more than short-covering to move
decisively up from here,"" said a senior trader at a Japanese
securities house, adding that the market still looked
vulnerable to euro-negative news given shaky equity markets.
 The Australian dollar, which has benefited from a gradual
return of investors to riskier assets in recent sessions, was
hurt by expectations that the central bank would keep interest
rates unchanged at 4.50 percent in July.
 Minutes for the Reserve Bank of Australia's June policy
meeting showed members had thought previous rate rises gave it
time to see if Europe's troubles would hurt world growth, and
to wait for more information on domestic inflation.
[ID:nSYC002333]
 The Ausssie  fell 0.2 percent to $0.8564, extending
its pullback from a one-month high of $0.8665 the previous day
when an overall improvement in risk appetite supported demand
for higher-yielding currencies.
 There were some positive takeaways from Moody's downgrade.
 ""A small crumb of comfort is that the stable outlook should
mean no further ratings changes from Moody's over the next
12-18 months, at least,"" said Standard Charetered Bank in a
note.
 ""Another positive point is that changes to ECB rules mean
that Greek debt is still eligible to be used as collateral,
albeit with a haircut and will continue to be eligible even if
the Fitch Rating also moves to junk,"" the note said.
 Fitch Ratings has rated Greece at BBB-minus, the lowest in
the investment grade category, with a negative outlook.

 HONG KONG, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell for the
third straight day on Thursday on rising doubts about global
economic growth, while the dollar steadied after scoring its
biggest gain in nearly two years as investors cut exposure to
riskier assets.
 High yielding currencies such as the Australian and New
Zealand dollars and commodity prices also slid following news
of a surprisingly large U.S. trade deficit and a downgrade of
Britain's growth forecast by the Bank of England.
 ""Globally, there's a growing sense that the economy is
slowing, with a number of economic indicators that appear to
show we have entered a period of adjustment,"" said Kenichi
Hirano, operating officer at Tachibana Securities.
 The U.S. trade gap widened 18.8 percent in June, suggesting
its second-quarter economic growth was weaker than previously
thought. The report came days after the U.S. central bank
issued a gloomier outlook for the economy and followed a spate
of data from China confirming its rapid imports and factory
output growth was slowing. [ID:nN11206050]

Nikkei average <.N225> sliding 2 percent to its lowest levels
in over a month.
 Sony Corp <6758.T> fell 3 percent and chip-tester maker

 Many Japanese exporters had set their currency rate
assumptions at around 90 yen per dollar for the financial year
to next March.
 The yen has gained nearly 9 percent against the dollar so
far this year as investors looked to lower-risk assets, even
though Japan's economy appears far more frail than that of the
United States.
 RISKY ASSETS RETREAT
 The Australian dollar, which is highly influenced by global
growth expectations, struck a two-week low of $0.8932 ,
and was down as much as 2.2 percent at one stage for its
biggest daily fall in six weeks. The New Zealand dollar 
was down about 1 percent at $0.7119, a three-week low.
 Adding to the Aussie's woes was data which showed July
unemployment rose more than expected as more people looked for
work, which lessens the risk of wage pressures building and

 TOKYO, June 15 (Reuters) - The euro's rally showed signs of
fading on Tuesday, with investors taking profits and sentiment
towards the single currency staying fragile as debt worries
returned after Moody's cut Greece's credit rating to junk grade.
 The Australian dollar pulled back further from a one-month
high versus the U.S. dollar as traders reduced demand for
higher-yielding currencies after minutes of an Australian central
bank meeting confirmed the market view that interest rates will

 ""The euro would need more than short-covering to move
decisively up from here,"" said a senior trader at a Japanese

 The euro was at $1.2204, down 0.1 percent from late New York

 Traders said Moody's downgrade was being used by investors as
an excuse to pare positions in the single currency. Moody's cut
Greece's credit rating to junk status and said the country faced
substantial risks..
 The Moody's downgrade could still have an effect in the
background, but an overall revival in risk appetite may check
sharp losses, traders said.
 While resistance is still around the first Fibonacci
retracement level at $1.2301, the 23.6 percent of the currency's
move from an April 14 high to its June 7 low, support is seen at
around $1.2165 on hourly charts.
 The euro fell as far as $1.1876 on June 7, its lowest since
March 2006.
 ""Whether the bounce in the euro from $1.19 to $1.22 is more
than a brief relief bounce remains open for debate but the sharp
reaction to the rating downgrade overnight suggests that
sentiment is still extremely fragile,"" Matthew Strauss, senior
currency strategist at RBC Capital wrote in a note.
 The euro fell 0.2 percent on the yen to 111.68 yen. The U.S.
dollar edged down to 91.50 yen as sell orders from Japanese
exporters were seen capping its gains.
 The Bank of Japan's policy decision expected around 12:30-2
p.m. (0330-0500 GMT) and Governor Masaaki Shirakawa's embargoed
press conference from 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) are the key events on
the Asian calendar on Tuesday..
 The BOJ is expected to announce details of a new lending
scheme, but that is unlikely to move the yen, traders said.
 The minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's June policy
meeting said it was able to leave interest rates unchanged in the
near term as previous rate hikes gave it time to see how Europe's
debt woes would affect the world economy and to wait for more
information on domestic inflation.
 Board members also said disinflationary forces in the
domestic economy had not been as strong as expected and
highlighted the importance of coming data on consumer prices, due
in late July, reinforcing expectations for steady interest rates
at its next policy-setting meeting in early July.
 The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.8554, extending
its pullback from a one-month high of $0.8665 the previous day

 * Moody's downgrade of Greece slices into stocks' rally
 * Euro climbs for 5th straight session
 * Oil up on increased risk appetite
 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished
Monday's session little changed in thin volume after a global
rally was interrupted by a downgrade of Greece's debt to junk
status, while the euro soared on strong European economic
data.
 Oil prices settled almost 2 percent higher as risk
appetite improved on economic recovery optimism, while
safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and gold prices fell as investors'
taste for risk grew.
 The euro and stocks had been struggling lately on fears
that debt crises in several European countries would imperil
the banking sector and slow growth in the 16-country euro zone
to a crawl, hampering a global economic recovery.
 Although not unexpected, the downgrade weighed on a market
that had rallied briskly off earlier data showing euro-zone
industrial output surged in April, achieving the biggest
year-on-year percentage gain in almost two decades.
[ID:nLDE65D0YC]
 Moody's Investors Service lowered Greece's sovereign debt
rating to BA1, which is junk-grade status, from an
investment-grade level of A3, citing concerns about risks
associated with euro zone's IMF support package.
 ""The market took this report negatively. But I am not
really surprised because even absent the ratings agency
action, Greece's paper is worthless except for that fact that
the European Central Bank is buying it,"" said Richard
Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New
York.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> slipped 20.18
points, or 0.20 percent, to close at 10,190.89. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> dipped 1.97 points, or 0.18 percent,
to finish at 1,089.63. But the Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC>
squeaked out a tiny gain of just 0.36 of a point, or 0.02
percent, to end at 2,243.96.
 The euro  rose to a session high, coming within a
breath of $1.23, its highest level since early June, but it
later pared gains after Moody's cut Greece's credit rating as
the country faces substantial risks. For more see
[ID:nWNA3381]. Late Monday in New York, the euro was up 1
percent at $1.2234.
 But analysts said most investors had anticipated the move,
which let them focus instead on stronger-than-expected euro-zone industrial data and extend a bout of short-covering that
has added some 4 cents to the euro since it hit $1.1876 last
week, its lowest since 2006. [ID:nLDE65D0YC]

people and anticipated this, as did pension funds, a long time
ago.""
 Despite Monday's gains, the euro is still down almost 15
percent against the dollar this year.
 However the CBOE volatility index <.VIX> or VIX, Wall
Street's main barometer of investor fear, fell 0.73 percent to
end at 28.58. This decline indicated the market was not
anticipating a return of recent volatility when the VIX rose
to nearly 50 in mid May.
 U.S. oil prices  rose $1.34, or 1.82 percent, to
settle at $75.12 per barrel. Before the downgrade, oil futures
prices rose more than 2.5 percent.
 Spot gold prices  fell $3.90, or 0.32 percent, to
$1,222.00 an ounce.
 U.S. Treasuries eased in light trading volume as early
strength in stocks undermined the safe-haven appeal of lower-
risk U.S. government debt.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 5/32, with the yield at 3.26 percent. The 2-year U.S.
Treasury note  was unchanged, with the yield at
0.7350 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was
down 15/32, with the yield at 4.18 percent.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2010 04:59PM ET</span>",EU leaders to back up budget balance with sanctions-draft," * EU leaders to present future budget plans
 * Decisions aim to reassure financial markets
 
 By Jan Strupczewski
 BRUSSELS, June 14 (Reuters) - European Union leaders will
agree on Thursday to present future budget plans to the European
Commission for assessment and to penalise countries which do not
aim for budget balance, draft conclusions showed on Monday.
 The decisions are part of the EU's efforts to reassure
financial markets that fiscal policies in the 27-nation bloc
will return to sustainable paths to prevent another debt crisis
like the Greek one. EU leaders will meet on Thursday.
 The draft conclusions of the leaders, obtained by Reuters,
show all countries should adopt laws to enforce EU budget rules,
called the Stability and Growth Pact, which limit budget
deficits to 3 percent of GDP and debt to 60 percent of GDP.
 The Pact also sets a medium-term objective for EU countries
which is a budget close to balance or in surplus.
 ""As regards the strengthening of budgetary discipline, (the
EU summit) agrees on strengthening the preventive arm of the
Pact, with possible sanctions or incentives attached to the
consolidation path towards the medium-term objective,"" the draft
conclusions said. 
 Countries sharing the single currency, the euro, are likely
to get special attention.
 ""These will be reviewed so as to have a coherent and
progressive system, ensuring a level playing field across Member
States, while taking into account Member States' participation
in the euro area,"" the leaders will say.
 The conclusions are the first result of discussions held by
the EU's Task Force -- EU finance ministers under the
chairmanship of EU President Herman Van Rompuy. The Task Force
is to toughen EU budget laws in a comprehensive package by
October.
 EU budget rules now envisage sanctions for euro zone
countries that repeatedly break the 3 percent deficit limit, but
there are no penalties for trying to bring the budget into
balance or for having high debt.
 The leaders will also agree to start paying attention to
debt levels and in order to prevent EU countries from embarking
on budgetary policies that are against EU budget rules, they
should adopt the EU regulations into national rules.
 ""(the EU summit) agrees on ... adoption by all Member States
of national budgetary rules and medium-term budgetary frameworks
in line with the Stability and Growth Pact; these should be
assessed by the Commission,"" the draft said.
 Countries will also submit their budget plans for European
Commission assessment.
 ""From 2011 onwards, presenting to the Commission in the
spring Stability and Convergence Programmes including budgetary
plans for the upcoming years, taking account of national
budgetary procedures,"" the draft conclusions said.
 Leaders will also agree to develop a scoreboard to better
assess competitiveness developments and imbalances and allow for
an early detection of unsustainable or dangerous trends in EU
countries and especially in the euro zone.

(Adds details)
 By Ka Yan Ng
 TORONTO, June 14 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar backed off
a four-week high but finished firmer against the U.S. currency
on Monday, aided by stronger energy prices.
 Early support took the currency to C$1.0225 to the U.S.
dollar, or 97.80 U.S. cents, a high last reached on May 14, as
oil prices rose to just shy of $76 a barrel, while natural gas
soared more than 5 percent. [O/R]
 ""The Canadian dollar continues to trade with some
beneficial influence off the back of stronger energy pricing,
particularly natural gas,"" said Jack Spitz, managing director
of foreign exchange at National Bank Financial.
 The currency pared gains halfway through the session, along
with the euro, after Moody's cut Greece's credit rating to junk
status and said the country faced substantial risks. The
downgrade had been anticipated by market players, and that
cushioned the euro's retreat. [ID:nWNA3381].
 ""All things being equal, the euro's ability to sustain news
like this actually speaks quite well and could contribute to
more euro gains,"" Spitz said. ""That in itself could contribute
to better offers in dollar/Canada.""
 The Canadian dollar finished at C$1.0325 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.85 U.S. cents, up from C$1.0338 to the U.S.
dollar, or 96.73 U.S. cents, at Friday's close.
 Some strong data has underscored recent optimism about the
world economic recovery: Euro zone industrial output in April
surged year-on-year more than in any month in almost two
decades, figures on Monday showed, while Chinese export data
last week signaled robust global demand. [ID:nLDE65D0YC]
 Positive sentiment also flowed from comments by St. Louis
Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, who said the
global recovery under way was unlikely to be thrown off course
by events in Europe or by the unlikely bursting of an asset
bubble in China. [ID:nTOE65D04O]
 BONDS FALL HARD
 Canadian bond prices fell as dimming worries about the
world's economic health pushed investors out of safe haven
assets such as government debt.
 ""There's been no new bad news,"" said Sheldon Dong, fixed
income analyst at TD Waterhouse Private Investment. ""That's why
the risk-on trade is coming back on.""
 Greece's downgrade, although expected by market players,
was felt most in equity markets, which sold off from session
highs. Toronto's main index finished little changed. [.TO]
 The two-year government bond  was off 7 Canadian
cents to yield 1.818 percent, while the 10-year bond
 sagged 30 Canadian cents to yield 3.440 percent.
 Canadian bonds underperformed U.S. issues across most of
the yield curve. The 10-year Canadian yield was 17.1 basis
points above its U.S. counterpart, down from about 17.6 basis
points on Friday.

 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose on Monday as
economic data eased concern about Europe's recovery and sparked
traders to buy higher-risk assets such as stocks and to reduce
bets against the euro zone's single currency.
 But Europe's problems did not recede from view entirely.

 TECHNICAL BARRIER BROKEN
 The euro and stocks had been struggling lately on fears
that debt crises in several European countries would imperil
the banking sector and slow growth in the 16-country euro zone
to a crawl.
 But euro gains on Monday pushed it past important technical
resistance for the first time since April 9, traders said.
 The euro also rose 0.8 percent to 111.85 yen

 The high-yield Australian dollar rose 1 percent to
US$0.8580 after touching a high of US$0.8668 , its best

 Sterling hit a one-month high above $1.48  after
the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility said government

 Some analysts cautioned that the euro's downtrend remained
intact as concerns about the banking sector and debt problems
in the euro zone are likely to persist for some time.

the euro in the week to June 8, though net short positions were

 By Manuela Badawy
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - A downgrade of Greece's debt
to junk status early Monday afternoon interrupted a global
stocks rally, forcing U.S. stock indexes to cut their gains
sharply.
 Earlier, stocks had rallied around the world and the euro
hit a session high on Monday, fueled by strong European
industrial data that increased optimism about a global
economic recovery.
 Moody's Investors Service lowered Greece's sovereign debt
rating to 'BA1, which is junk-grade status, from an
investment-grade level of A3, citing concerns about risks
associated with euro zone's IMF support package.
[ID:nWNA3381]
 In response to the downgrade, the three major U.S. stock
indexes sharply cut their earlier gains of 1 percent or more.
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 56.30
points, or 0.55 percent, at 10,267.37 -- off a session high of
10,328.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> was up 7.07
points, or 0.65 percent, at 1,098.67 -- off a session high of
1,105.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 23.13
points, or 1.03 percent, at 2,266.73 -- off a session high of
2,278.96.
 U.S. oil futures prices  also retrenched sharply
after the Greek downgrade and were last up 90 cents above $74
a barrel. Oil was up about 1 percent, or 71 cents, at $74.49 a
barrel -- off an earlier jump of 2.5 percent or more. The
morning rally in oil followed the European data, which had
relieved concerns about a slowdown in global growth.
 The euro  retreated from a session high just below
$1.23, following the Greek debt downgrade, and was last at
$1.2238.
 Before the news about Greece's debt rating, the catalyst
for financial markets was the April reading on European
industrial production -- its year-over-year increase was the
biggest percentage gain in almost two decades. which had
reassured investors that the global economic recovery could be
picking up steam. [ID:nLDE65D0YC]
 Safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and gold prices also sharply
cut the morning's losses after the Greek debt downgrade.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 15/32, with the yield at 3.30 percent. That marked a
price improvement of several ticks following the Greek debt
downgrade.
 Spot gold  fell $5.70 to $1,224.50 an ounce,
following the Greek debt downgrade.
 Before the news about Greece from Moody's, the world
stocks index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 1.6 percent while U.S.
equities climbed, following strong advances in European and
Asian stock markets. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
index<.FTEU3> ended the day at 1,029.59 points, the highest
close since May 13.
 Japan's Nikkei average <.N225> ended Monday's session up
1.80 percent at 9,879.85, close to its psychological
resistance level of 10,000 and above its 25-day moving

 (Adds U.S. industry comment)
 By Doug Palmer and Foo Yun Chee
 WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS, June 14 (Reuters) - A World Trade
Organization panel has broadly backed the United States, Japan
and Taiwan in their bid to overturn controversial EU tariffs on
three electronics products, a U.S. trade official said on
Monday in Washington.
 ""I can confirm that the panel agreed with the U.S., Japan,
and Taiwan on essentially all of our claims,"" said the U.S.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the
interim panel ruling is still confidential.
 The three countries sued the European Union at the WTO in
July 2008, saying EU duties on flat-panel displays,
multifunction printers and TV set-top boxes violated the WTO's
Information Technology Agreement (ITA).
 The agreement, which eliminates import duties on goods such
as computer screens and printers, seeks to boost trade in
high-tech goods around the world.
 The panel handed its interim report to participants last
Friday. A final report, which rarely makes substantial changes
to the interim report, was expected in September.
 ""The report says that the EU's technology tariffs violate
its obligations to the WTO,"" said a second source in Brussels,
Both sources declined to provide more details.
 The EU's executive commission said it was studying the
report. ""It is a technical, complex issue,"" spokesman John
Clancy said. He declined to say more because the report was
confidential.
 John Neuffer, vice president for global policy at the
Information Technology Industry Council in Washington, said if
reports of a victory for the United States, Japan and Taiwan
""are accurate, this would be a an important pro-innovation,
pro-growth, pro-jobs result.""
 He urged the EU ""to quickly renounce its past flawed
interpretations of the ITA, eliminate duties on the products at
issue in the dispute, and implement the ITA as it should be
implemented -- to spur growth and innovation globally.""
 The EU in September 2008 called for an overhaul of the ITA,
saying new products and markets should be added to the list.
 The EU imported about $11 billion worth of the three
products from all suppliers in 2007, with tariffs ranging from
6 to 14 percent.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Monday as European economic data eased concerns about the
region's recovery and prompted a bout of short-covering in the
currency on increased risk appetite.
 The euro moved further away from a recent four-year low to
hit just below $1.2300 -- its highest in more than a week --
after better-than-expected euro zone industrial output.
 European equity markets closed at a one-month high and U.S.
stocks rose sharply, following rises in Asia.
 ""The concerns about sovereign debt default in Europe seem
to be diminishing. I'm not sure whether that's realistic or
not, but at least the market isn't as focused on it as it was
once before,"" said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at
Tempus Consulting in Washington.
 ""We are starting to see a little bit of reintroduction of
risk, and really we have to look at the euro as having been
significantly oversold,"" he added.
 In midday New York trading, the euro rose 1.4 percent to
$1.2278, after hitting the day's high of $1.2298, according to
electronic trading platform EBS. Last week, the single currency
reached as low as $1.1876, its lowest since early 2006.
 Traders said hedge funds had been seen cutting short
positions in euro-dollar on a break of $1.2150/60 in Asia and
then through $1.2220 in Europe.
 Technical analysts said a rebound in the euro gained
momentum after the currency broke the important $1.2150 mark,
suggesting further gains to $1.2400. Resistance levels were
highlighted at $1.2330 and $1.2445, the 2008 and 2009 lows.
 ""There is room for a rebound in the euro from here. Our
one-month forecast is for a move to $1.25, but after that we
expect it to go down,"" said Derek Halpenny, European head of
currency research at BTM-UFJ.
 The euro also jumped 1.5 percent to 112.66 yen, while the
dollar gained 0.2 percent to 91.86 yen.
 DOWNTREND REMAINS
 Analysts cautioned that the euro's downtrend remained
intact as concerns about the banking sector and debt problems
in the euro zone are likely to persist for some time.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed
speculators boosted their bets against the euro in the week
ended June 8, although net short positions were below record
levels.
 ""We have seen this kind of (bounce) happen before, only to
be surprised once again to the downside. We still see weakness
and a bit of a grind lower in euro-dollar,"" said Sacha Tihanyi,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
 Despite Monday's gains, the euro is still down almost 15
percent against the dollar this year.
 The Australian dollar gained 1.5 percent versus the U.S.
dollar to trade at US$0.8633, after touching a high of
US$0.8668, the highest level in almost a month.
 The dollar was down 1.2 percent versus a currency basket at
86.481. Analysts said the greenback could be undermined by U.S.
President Barack Obama and his aides calling for more stimulus
to support the economy, which would stir worries about the U.S.
fiscal deficit.
 Sterling rose more than 1 percent to hit a one-month high
against the dollar after the UK's newly created Office for
Budget Responsibility said it expected government borrowing to
fall slightly faster than originally thought.
 The pound was last up 1.6 percent versus the dollar at
$1.4775. The euro was down 0.1 percent at 83.10 pence.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - World stocks rose more
than 1 percent on Monday to their highest in over a week and
the euro firmed from recent four-year lows as investors' risk
tolerance rose and euro zone industrial output data surged.
 Safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and gold prices eased as
appetite for risky assets picked up, while oil rose more than 2
percent lifted by global risk appetite as optimism about
economic recovery improved.
 A tentative equity rally since late May has lifted world
stocks by around 6 percent from their lows. The index
<.MIWD00000PUS> was up 1.2 percent.
 Similarly, MSCI's main emerging market stock index
<.MSCIEF> has gained more than 9 percent since hitting a year
low on May 25. It was up 1.6 percent Monday.
 While markets were spooked a week back by U.S. data showing
weak growth in private sector job creation, strong economic
data from China has reinforced a belief that the world recovery
is indeed gaining traction.
 U.S. stocks were in positive territory boosted by
technology and industrial shares as European industrial
production in April surged year-on-year more than in any month
in almost two decades. For more see [ID:nLDE65D0YC].
 The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 56.68
points, or 0.56 percent, at 10,267.75. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index <.SPX> was up 6.89 points, or 0.63 percent, at
1,098.49. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> was up 22.80
points, or 1.02 percent, at 2,266.40.
 ""Consumer sentiment is better (and) we're just a few weeks
away from the Q2 reporting season, for which the indications
are very healthy for the market,"" said Christian Stocker,
strategist at UniCredit Global Research, in Munich. ""We have
more positive than negative news, and there is a lot of short
covering.""
 Part of the current rally is due to this year's sell-off --
world stocks are down 6 percent year to date and 8.2 percent
for the second quarter -- but it is also the result of a belief
among many investors that the underlying economic backdrop is
relatively positive and that will support corporate earnings.
 David Buik, senior partner at BGC partners in London, said
the wave of risk aversion in May had left shares a bit
""oversold.""
 ""Second quarter earnings will be somewhat better than
people expect and there may be just a little bit of mileage
left in the current rally,"" Buik said.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was up 0.9
percent to a four-week high after strong euro zone industrial
output rekindled optimism over the bloc's economic outlook.
 The rally was driven by banking, mining and commodity
stocks, all of which tend to gain when economic sentiment is on
the plus side.
 A slight easing in worries over the euro zone crisis helped
the banking sector, with leading banks Barclays, HSBC, Societe
Generale and Deutsche Bank rising 0.9 to 2.6 percent.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock index <.N225> closed up 1.8
percent, driven higher by exporters, again a group with a high
correlation to economic growth.
 ""What is helping the market is the notion that a double dip
recession is not a big risk,"" said Bernard McAlinden,
investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. ""I think
that is what the markets are latching onto.""
 EURO RISE
 The euro rose broadly as gains in global stock markets
lifted risk appetite and prompted traders to pare back bets
against the euro zone single currency. The euro moved further
away from a recent four-year low to trade above $1.2250 
-- its highest in more than a week.
 The euro has risen more than 2.4 percent over the past five
trading sessions but is still down around 15 percent year to
date.
 Overall, however, negative sentiment about the euro,
prompted by fears about euro zone debt and the economic cost of
cutting it, remained, with analysts ascribing the streak of
gains to the market's pro-risk mood.
 U.S. Treasuries and gold prices eased as improving appetite
for assets seen as higher risk, such as equities and the euro,
led to receding interest in U.S. government bonds and the
precious metal as a safe haven.
 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note  was
down 19/32 in price, with the yield at 3.31 percent. The 2-year
U.S. Treasury note  was down 1/32, yielding 0.76
percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond  was down
1-7/32 to yield 4.23 percent.
 Crude oil  rose $1.91, or 2.59 percent, to $75.69 per
barrel, while spot gold  fell $2.05, or 0.17 percent, to
$1223.80 an ounce.

 By Jonathan Lynn
 GENEVA, June 14 (Reuters) - Emergency bailouts by
governments to cope with the financial crisis have distorted
investment flows and should be scaled back as soon as it is safe
to do so, an international report released on Monday said.
 But the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
also found that regular investment policies in recent months had
tended to keep markets open and promote investment flows.
 Their joint report, looking at investment measures between
November 2009 and May this year, estimates that the total amount
of public commitments by G20 states -- in the form of equity,
loans and guarantees -- exceeded $1 trillion as of May 20.
 The most prominent example of such measures is the $700
billion U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).
 The U.S. Treasury Department said on May 21 that TARP would
end up costing about $105 billion following repayments of funds
and increases in the value of shares in public ownership, such
as those of Citigroup.
 OECD Senior Economist Kathryn Gordon said emergency bailouts
in G20 states had led governments in the reporting period into
one-on-one relationships with hundreds of financial firms and
some 20,000 non-financial firms -- the ""ultimate discrimination""
against those without such ties.
 ""This is a source of great concern to us... that governments
continue to engage in these one-on-one relationships,"" she told
a news conference in Geneva. ""We recognise it may be necessary
when dealing with the crisis but it is a source of concern for
international investment.""
 
 PUBLIC FUNDS BLOAT DEBT
 UNCTAD and the OECD said bailouts and government support had
a tendency to become entrenched, skewing investment flows.
 ""Such schemes should be scaled back as quickly as economic
conditions permit so as to send a strong message to domestic and
foreign investors that they henceforth are expected to operate
without state aid on a commercial basis in the market place,""
the report said.
 The UNCTAD/OECD study, the third such review, was
commissioned by the G20 group of rich and emerging nations for
their summit in Toronto at the end of the month.
 In another report prepared for the G20, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) said governments worldwide have largely
resisted erecting trade barriers in response to the downturn but
warned about an increasing use of export restrictions on food
products and commodities.
 ""Given the current economic environment and the risks ahead,
governments should remain vigilant to preserve the level of
trade openness and act to remove the most trade restrictive
measures taken over previous periods,"" the WTO said in its
assessment of trends from November to May.
 Most of the new trade restricting or distorting policies put
in place since November have affected base metals, mostly steel,
as well as machinery, farm products and transportation
equipment, the WTO found.
 The OECD and UNCTAD warnings about the impact of bailouts
contrasted with generally positive marks for specific investment
policies undertaken by G20 governments in the reporting period.
 ""The policy measures put in place by G20 members are mainly
in the direction of further opening and liberalisation of
investment regimes or facilitating investment flows,"" James
Zhan, director of UNCTAD's investment and enterprise division,
told the Geneva briefing.
 Global flows of foreign direct investment -- on which many
developing countries rely for their growth -- fell by almost 40
percent in 2009 but are likely to pick up modestly this year,
UNCTAD said in January.
 Zhan said that the global economy needed a revival of
private capital flows, as the public investments seen in the
bailouts were unsustainable and generated state debts.

 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose broadly on
Monday as gains in global stock markets lifted risk appetite
and prompted traders to pare back bets against the single
euro-zone currency.
 The euro moved further away from a recent four-year low to
trade above $1.2250 -- its highest in more than a week.
Stronger-than-expected euro zone industrial output further
boosted the currency.
 European equity markets touched a four-week high and U.S.
stock futures gained, following rises in Asia.
 Despite Monday's bounce, analysts cautioned that the euro's
downtrend remained intact as concerns about the banking sector
and the structural problems in the euro zone are likely to
persist for some time.
 ""Euro-dollar is performing well, following better than
expected industrial production data, and in a reflection of the
lessening degree of risk-aversion in today's market,"" said
Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in
Toronto.
 ""We have seen this kind of thing happen before, only to be
surprised once again to the downside. We still see weakness and
a bit of a grind lower in euro-dollar,"" he added.
 In early New York trading, the euro rose 1.3 percent to
$1.2265, after hitting the day's high of $1.2273, according to
electronic trading platform EBS. Last week, the single currency
reached as low as $1.1876, its lowest since early 2006.
 Traders said hedge funds had been seen cutting short
positions in euro-dollar on a break of $1.2150/60 in Asia and
then through $1.2220 in Europe.
 Technical analysts were looking for a close above the
21-day moving average at $1.2234 for the first time since
mid-April. Additional resistance levels were highlighted at
$1.2330 and $1.2445, the 2008 and 2009 lows.
 Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed
speculators boosted their bets against the euro in the week
ended June 8, although net short positions were below record
levels.
 ""The positioning is not extreme, but there is room for a
rebound in the euro from here. Our one-month forecast is for a
move to $1.25, but after that we expect it to go down,"" said
Derek Halpenny, European head of currency research at BTM-UFJ.
 Despite Monday's gains, the euro is still down almost 15
percent against the dollar this year.
 The euro also jumped 1.5 percent to 112.66 yen, while the
dollar gained 0.2 percent to 91.86 yen.
 Some analysts said risk appetite was also supported by
comments from policymakers, including St. Louis Federal Reserve
Bank President James Bullard, who said a strong global economic
recovery was underway.
 The Australian dollar gained 1.5 percent versus the U.S.
dollar to trade at US$0.8628, after touching a high of
US$0.8645, the highest level in almost a month.
 The Aussie dollar also gained 1.3 percent against the
low-yielding yen, which was soft across the board, touching its
highest in nearly four weeks.
 The dollar was down 1.2 percent versus a currency basket at
86.481. Analysts said the greenback could be undermined by U.S.
President Barack Obama and his aides calling for more stimulus
to support the economy, which could stir worries about the U.S.
fiscal deficit.
 Sterling received a boost after the UK's newly created
Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected government
borrowing to fall slightly faster than originally thought.
 The pound was last up 1.5 percent versus the dollar at
$1.4762. The euro was down 0.2 percent at 83.03 pence.

 The World Trade Organization (WTO) is issuing a related
report on trade measures in G20 countries. Trade experts said
last week that that report, and a broader one looking at all the
WTO's 153 members, would show that protectionism remained a risk
but was broadly under control.

 By Stanley White
 TOKYO, June 14 (Reuters) - A strong global economic recovery
is under way, and is unlikely to be thrown off course by
European debt woes or the improbable event of the bursting of an
asset bubble in China, a top U.S. Federal Reserve official said
on Monday.
 ""While the sovereign debt crisis in Europe is indeed a
serious matter, the global recovery at this point looks very
strong and seems unlikely to be derailed,"" said St. Louis
Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard in remarks prepared
for delivery to a conference in Tokyo.
 Bullard also said Europe's sovereign debt crisis had not
pushed back the timing of an eventual rise in the Fed's
benchmark interest rate, as some market watchers have
speculated.
 The recovery in the U.S. economy needs to become more firm
in order for the Fed to raise rates, Bullard told reporters at a
briefing in Tokyo.
 Bullard, a voter on the Fed's interest-rate setting panel
this year, said he expected the U.S. economy as measured by
gross domestic product would recover to pre-global crisis levels
by the third quarter of this year.
 He also said U.S. inflation is contained now but could
become a risk in the mid term due to the large U.S. budget
deficit and the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policy.
 ""Europe has not changed the idea of when we will move the
federal funds rate,"" Bullard said.
 The Fed is expected at a meeting next week to renew its
pledge to hold rates exceptionally low for an extended period.
Its target for the benchmark federal funds rate is zero to 0.25
percent.
 The euro tumbled to a four-year low against the dollar a
week ago and global stock markets sank on fears that Europe's
sovereign debt crisis would jeopardise the banking system and
dampen global growth.
 But the financial turmoil in Europe is not large enough to
spread to the United States and Asia, Bullard said. ""The United
States may be a beneficiary of Europe, because their problems
are causing a flight to quality that is lowering long-term
Treasury yields,"" Bullard said.
 ""This will have a more stimulative impact than the negative
implications of dollar appreciation.""

 JOB CREATION WILL PICK UP
 The U.S. recovery is likely to continue and private-sector
job creation will start to pick up in the summer, gradually
pushing the jobless rate lower this year, Bullard said.
 Some economists may have an overly pessimistic view of the
U.S. labour market as they are excluding the number of temporary
jobs created, he said.
 U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in April for the
first time in a year, with the core annual inflation rate
recording its smallest gain since 1966, data showed last month.
 Core consumer price data could be distorted by a weak
housing market and if this factor is excluded the data would
show prices of other goods are rising, Bullard said.
 ""In late 2008 and early 2009 I was pretty concerned about
deflation,"" Bullard later said after giving a speech.
 ""But the United States has missed the main danger point of
deflation. I am not as worried about deflation now.""
 Bullard was among three Fed officials who sought an increase
in the Fed's discount rate in April. The discount rate,
currently at 0.75 percent, is the rate the Fed charges
commercial banks for loans.
 But Bullard's latest comments did not appear to express
impatience with the course of Fed policy.
 The pressure on commercial banks' dollar funding due to
turmoil in Europe means the Fed does not need to raise the
discount rate for the time being, he said.
 ""Now is not the time to normalise the discount rate,""
Bullard said.
 ""If we did make any further moves in the discount rate, this
would not be a signal of future monetary policy tightening.""
 Bullard has warned before that the Fed's pledge to maintain
unusually low rates for an extended period could, if misread,
perpetuate the boom-and-bust cycle that plunged the United
States and the world into recession.
 He has also has emerged as an advocate for quickly shrinking
the Fed's extensive quantitative easing efforts by selling off
some of the mortgage-related debt the central bank has bought to
stabilise the financial system and pull the economy out of the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
 The Fed is prepared to expand its quantitative easing if
needed, but improvements in the U.S. economy suggest this won't
be necessary, Bullard said.
 The consensus view at the Fed, reflected by Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke, is that its bloated balance sheet will shrink
naturally as the assets mature or are paid off.

 By Jeremy Gaunt, European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - World stocks rose 1 percent on
Monday to their highest level in over a week and heading for
their fourth straight day of gains as investors banked on global
economic recovery to trump concerns over euro zone debt.
The euro also followed up its best week this year against
the dollar to rise 1 percent. It gained 1.6 percent
last week after slumping to a four-year low to the greenback.
 A tentative equity rally since late May has lifted world
stocks by around 6 percent from their lows. The index was up 0.9
percent by 1145 GMT on Monday.
 Similarly, MSCI's main emerging market stock index has
gained more than 9 percent since hitting a year low on May 25.
It was up 1.4 percent on Monday.
 While markets were spooked a week back by U.S. data showing
measly growth in private sector job creation, strong economic
data from China has reinforced a belief that the world recovery
is indeed gaining traction.
 In the United States, President Barack Obama is stepping
up a push for more government spending to boost the economy via
tax breaks to some businesses and more jobless benefits, adding
to last year's $863 billion stimulus. 
 Part of the current rally is due to this year's sell off --
world stocks are down 6 percent year to date and 8.2 percent for
the second quarter -- but it is also the result of a belief
among many investors that the underlying economic backdrop is
relatively positive and that will support corporate earnings.
 David Buik, senior partner at BGC partners said the wave of
risk aversion in May had left shares a bit ""oversold"".
 ""Second quarter earnings will be somewhat better than people
expect and there may be just a little bit of mileage left in the
current rally,"" Buik said.
 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.8 percent to a
four-week high after strong euro zone industrial output
rekindled optimism over the bloc's economic outlook.
 The rally was driven by banking, mining and commodity
stocks, all of which tend to gain when economic sentiment is on
the plus side.
 A slight easing in worries over the euro zone crisis helped
the banking sector, with leading banks Barclays, HSBC, Societe
Generale and Deutsche Bank rising 0.9 to 2.6 percent.
 U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street,
adding to last week's gains and tracking gains in global
equities, with futures for the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100
all up around 0.8 percent.
 Earlier, Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.8 percent, driven higher
by exporters, again a group with a high correlation to economic
growth.
 ""What is helping the market is the notion that a double dip
recession is not a big risk,"" said Bernard McAlinden, investment
strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. ""I think that is what
the markets are latching on to.""
 
 EURO REBOUND
 The euro firmed against the dollar, as hedge funds covered
short positions on the single European currency.
 The euro traded with gains of around 1 percent versus the
dollar at $1.2231 after hitting the day's high of $1.2258 on
trading platform EBS.
 It has risen more than 2.4 percent over the past five
trading sessions but is still down around 15 percent year to
date.
 ""The dollar is softer against the euro as steady sentiment
helped risk currencies recover further,"" said Geoffrey Yu,
currency strategist at UBS. ""Equity markets performed solidly,
especially on the back of expectations that policy will remain
relatively loose for an extended period globally.""
 Overall, however, negative sentiment about the euro,
prompted by fears for euro zone debt and the economic cost of
cutting it, remained, with analysts ascribing the streak of
gains to the market's pro-risk mood.
 U.S. Treasuries fell, with benchmark 10-year note yielding
3.2804 percent, up 4.8 basis points on the day. Two-year yields
were up 3.2 basis points at 0.7661 percent. 
 Euro zone bonds likewise weakened, with the 10-year Bund
yield at 2.629 percent, up 6 basis points.
